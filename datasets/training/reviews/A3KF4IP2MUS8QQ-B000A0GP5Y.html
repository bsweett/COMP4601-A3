Fortunately, there's a lot more funny stuff where that came from in this comedic remake of The Longest Yard.  I was never a big fan of the original, so I can't compare and contrast the two here.  What I can say is that the remake, which milks as many stereotypes as it can find for all their comedic worth, is a genuinely funny movie.  There's no effort to make some kind of sociological argument here.  The Longest Yard is just a comedy, pure and simple.  Even the one serious moment in the film doesn't really hit you with anything more than surprise at what just happened.<br /><br />With the tandem of Adam Sandler and Chris Rock leading the way, you know you're going to do some laughing.  Combining two such heavyweight comedians in one film, though, is a handicap in some ways because your expectations may be too high going in.  That's probably why some viewers don't think the film is funny enough for their liking.  I think the inclusion of Burt Reynolds in the cast was a bit of risk, but the role of the old veteran really fits in perfectly with the script.  The rest of the cast is a hodgepodge of surprising faces: Cloris Leachman as the warden's lecherous (and thereby disgusting) secretary; professional wrestlers Bill Goldberg (who, like Burt Reynolds, did play college FB), Kevin Nash, and Steve Austin; former NFL players Michael Irvin (Michael Irvin as a prison inmate is perfect casting, if you ask me), Bill Romanowski, and Brian Bosworth (who was in the NFL only long enough for my man Bo Jackson to run him over on Monday Night Football).  With Sandler serving as executive director, you have to wonder how this motley crew of individuals could have been held together long enough to actually make a movie.  You can't argue with results, though.<br /><br />There's not much to the story.  Paul Crewe (Sandler) is a former NFL MVP whose career ended with a point shaving scandal.  Now, six years later, he seems determined to ruin his life completely and winds up in the big house, Texas-style.  The warden wants him to help get his prison guard football team in shape for the upcoming season, and he ends up recruiting a team of convicts to take on the guards in a pre-season game.  All of the inmates hated him at first, with the exception of Caretaker (Chris Rock), so he's got his work cut out even fielding a team, let alone teaching them how to play.  There are some bad dudes in the joint, though, and the opportunity to crack heads with the hated guards can be a pretty powerful recruiting tool.  The game itself turns into a big event, as ESPN2 and Chris Berman come in to broadcast it nation-wide.  You know everything that's going to happen, but it doesn't matter one iota.  The closest thing you get to suspense is your natural curiosity over the possibility of Burt Reynolds' overstretched face popping at any given moment.<br /><br />Is this Adam Sandler or Chris Rock at his best?  No, not by a long shot.  Still, it's a consistently funny film, and you just can't go too far wrong with a combination of comedy and football - not with male viewers, anyway.</p></body></html>

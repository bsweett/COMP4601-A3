<meta name="summary" content="One of the best films of the year!"></head><body><p>This film is amazing. The acting. The direction. Everything is perfect! The story reminded me of "Oliver Twist". You all know the story by now, so I will not go into the details. I'll just tell you that if you have not seen it, do so, as soon as possible! The acting is top-notch, all around. The characters really come to life, and you want to see them succeed! Yes, there is a Hollywood ending. The good thing about this one is that it does not feel forced. The story ends perfectly.<br /><br />It's also a much needed dose of reality. The rough depiction of life in the slums is unforgettable. Danny Boyle has always been an amazing director, and I love his work. This film is no exception! This film does have it's critics, but I'd advise you to see the film and judge for yourself! Don't let anyone stop you from seeing it.<br /><br />Oh, and the soundtrack is amazing! Stay for the end credits.<br /><br />SEE IT!</p></body></html>

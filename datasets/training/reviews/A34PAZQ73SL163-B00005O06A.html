Its technological advancements are notable as the artistic talents of the director still us dazzle today. The choice of camera angles, the settings for the scenes, and the entire idea of a film-long treatment of a man's psychological makeup illustrates just how innovative and unique this classic is. The "rosebud" mystery holds our attention throughout. Outside of the film itself, the history of its production and release is nearly as interesting as what transpires on the screen. Frankly, I was surprised that Hearst did not sue Orson Welles for defamation, but then I read an article showcasing all the differences between the life of W. Randolph Hearst and those of Charles Foster Kane; so now I'm not sure what to think about the controversy. Anyway, it adds another level of allure to this masterpiece.<br /><br />Citizen Kane is a powerful film that deserves to be studied for another century or more. I  recommend it, but, in my opinion, it is not close to being the greatest film of all time. Although its worth is undeniable, I can only place it in my Top 30 list. It manages to be brilliant and overrated, which is as difficult and unprecedented a combination as there may be. Others from the period, like Casablanca and The Maltese Falcon outshine the Welles effort.</p></body></html>

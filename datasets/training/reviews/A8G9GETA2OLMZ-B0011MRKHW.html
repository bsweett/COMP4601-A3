<meta name="summary" content="Not as Good as the First "Elizabeth""></head><body><p>I loved the first "Elizabeth" with Cate Blanchett, and so was eager to see the follow-up.<br /><br />It doesn't compare.<br /><br />It is gorgeous in design and costumes.  For the most part the acting is good.  But the plot and the writing are stiff.<br /><br />Everything is a set piece.  People simply pose, deliver their lines, and swirl away.  This makes the movie curiously static.<br /><br />There isn't much interaction between characters.  This becomes blatant with Clive Owen.  I have heard Owen declare in an interview that actors don't have to show "emotion."  Well, in this one, he certainly doesn't.  He has two expressions: Amused in a Superior Way, and Sternly Serious.  These get old fast, and contribute nothing.  Owen is a kinetic actor like Tom Cruise, and when he is not in motion he is dull, almost embarrassing.<br /><br />Geoffrey Rush is also wasted in this one.  He puts in his cameos and vanishes.<br /><br />Worst of all, the plot jigsaw never fits together.  There is a vague suspense theme, involving Mary Stuart and Phillip II, but it is so un-suspenseful that it hardly makes sense.  There is even a suspense underplot, involving the Walsingham brothers, but again, it is limp to the point of sleepy.<br /><br />The movie ends up feeling like a series of glamorous stills.  Nothing exciting happens.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Such a disappointing movie."></head><body><p>I sat down ready to watch what I had hoped would be a great sci-fi action film. I expected another movie to give the 'Alien' series a run for it's money. I feel like I wasted my time. I want it back. I feel like the producers of this film pulled a fast one on me.<p>The film follows a group of people on a starship who crashland on a remote planet. One character, Vin Diesel's Riddick, is an escaped convict heading back to prison having just been recaptured. As the group search the area around the crashsite, the find that the planet's three suns are going to set, and they will be plunged into total darkness. In this darkness lies a terror worse than Riddick. Blah, blah, blah...<p>We all know the hype. The commercials were good and the special effects look good. Honestly, three-quarters of the way into this movie, I was enjoying it. There were several plot twists that were totally unexpected, and fairly refreshing, until toward the end of the film. One plot twist too many, and the movie lost me as a fan. I felt cheated, or better yet, tricked.<p>Diesel does a good job with the acting in this movie. The special effects were fantastic, and the creatures were pretty scary. Not as nightmare-inducing as the alien, but still a bit scary. <p>They say that two things can make or break a movie. These being the beginning and the ending. The movie had a solid beginning, but alas, a poor ending.</p></body></html>

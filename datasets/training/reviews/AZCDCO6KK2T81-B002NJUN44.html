<meta name="summary" content="An ambitious disappointment."></head><body><p>A respectable cast, visually striking, ambitious film that fails to deliver on what could have been something of a masterpiece.<br /><br />Without having known in advance that the author was so young, I did find the book heavily influenced by both the written and screen work of LOTR as well as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AUHOM">Dragonslayer</a> and written in a rather amateurish fashion.  Don't get me wrong; I highly commend this young author for being able to even get a book publish in this very competitive market and he does have talent, but it's rather raw and overly visual (he may make a better screenwriter).  This is why I think Hollywood failed to do justice to his work.<br /><br />This was a picturesque novel with some very traditional themes that should have translated well to the big screen.  Some striking visuals are present in the film, but not what I had hoped for or expected following the LOTR saga.  The actors are all fine, especially newcomer Edward Speleers, and  Rachel Weisz whose voice is captivating and sexy as Saphira.  Jeremy Irons is always a pleasure to have on hand, but he does look a bit bored with his role that is all too familiar.  I expect him to yell out at any moment "May the force be with you."  John Malkovich has played so many Hollywood baddies these days that at this point he seems to be mocking those roles now.  I almost expect him to wink at the camera after delivering an evil cliche-ridden line.<br /><br />The pacing is probably the biggest flaw in this film.  My kids, 11 and 15, were rather bored with it.  They would be momentarily enthralled with the action sequences and visual effects, but then walk off to get a drink or something until the music keyed in another action scene.  The story failed to hold them as they have seen better work in this genre and therein lies the films other fatal flaw.<br /><br />The original work that this film is based upon is somewhat weak in of itself.  It lacks depth and maturity, but certainly hints at better things to come from this author.  It's hard to take a so-so work and make a successful film from it, although it can be done.  In addition, it is even harder to so with a work that is obviously very influenced by far greater works.  Still, I think Hollywood blew this one.<br /><br />Hollywood is capable of improving upon the written word at times and especially with more visual novels.  Some average visual books (IMO) that became great films are <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008KLVG4">Jaws</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0792839064">The Great Train Robbery</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005UK30">Moby Dick</a>, and the Harry Potter films which I think are actually better than the unnecessarily bloated novels upon which they are based (now don't start throwing rocks at me).  And, yes, you read right about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0486432157">Moby-Dick</a>.  It is considered a classic and for good reason, but that doesn't mean it isn't filled with way too much blubber.<br /><br />In any event, my point is that Hollywood missed an opportunity to rework the weak aspects of a generally good tale and squandered the talents of those within this film.  The film is just okay.  It soars every once in awhile, but feels ponderous and bloated with self-importance at other times.  It's watchable, but not all that enjoyable or memorable.</p></body></html>

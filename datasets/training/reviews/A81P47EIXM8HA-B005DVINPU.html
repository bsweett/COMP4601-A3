<meta name="summary" content="duplication of 2 DVD set as far as extras...blu-ray picture fine"></head><body><p>I just viewed this Blu-Ray and while its an improvement over the 2 Disc edition as far as picture ...its not as dramatic as I hoped for. That may be because the recent editions were pretty good or the source material being a couple decades old and very dark isn't  as suited toward  eye popping blu-ray results as more recent fair.  They've imported ALL the bonus features from  disc 2 on the previous 2 disc edition on the single disc. I have viewed the other 3 re-issues and the picture does improve with each so I am assuming they've done what they can with the first one.<br /><br />I purchased through amazon.co.uk for a scant 12 pounds, and it plays fine on my SONY blu-ray player...I don't believe there are region problems on these.</p></body></html>

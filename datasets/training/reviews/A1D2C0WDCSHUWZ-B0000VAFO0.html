<meta name="summary" content="It howls, it bites"></head><body><p>There are two kinds of directorial debuts. There are the kinds that instantly establish directors as critically-acclaimed and immensely talented, and then there are movies like &quot;Underworld.&quot; Len Wiseman's vampires vs. werewolves flick had so much promise, and just about all of it is squandered.<p>The vampires and Lycans have been at war for centuries, for reasons that are revealed later in the movie. Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is one of the vampires whose sole duty and purpose is to hunt down and kill the Lycans (a &quot;death dealer,&quot; har har) with guns that shoot silver bullets. The Lycans, in turn, fire ultraviolet bullets that can kill the vampires. Whatever.<p>Enter Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman), a young human who is being followed by the Lycans. Selene is intrigued by why he's important to the Lycans, but unfortunately he's been bitten by one, and is now in danger of becoming one. To uncover the answers about why Corvin is important, Selene will uncover the truth about both the Lycan and vampire races -- and secrets about her own past.<p>There hasn't been a halfway decent vampire flick in uncounted years, or a decent werewolf flick in even longer. Looks like that  Taking &quot;Underworld&quot; even semi-seriously is hard to do; it's like the unwanted illegitimate child of &quot;Matrix&quot; and &quot;Blade,&quot; without the appeal of either. The special effects are okay, but the story and action (not to mention the near-nonexistant romance) are as cold and clammy as a vampire's kiss.<p>Wiseman's clumsiness is shown vividly in the action scenes, which are all cloned from &quot;Matrix&quot; -- lots of bullets, swirling leather and antigravity jumps. And some humor might have elevated this film to action camp, but heroes and villains alike are so earnest that they almost come across as goofy. There are plenty of gaping plot holes that could have been avoided (why do vampires spend all their time lounging around?), but Wiseman apparently doesn't bother to try spackling them shut.<p>Kate Beckinsale, a talented young actress, is horribly wasted here. Most of her time is spent pouting and wearing how-can-she-move leather. Her chemistry with Speedman is nil, which is good, since the romance between them is also virtually nonexistant. Speedman does what he can, but he doesn't have much to work with. Bill Nighy alone gets to chew the scenery as senior vamp Viktor.<p>Relentlessly hokey and humorless, &quot;Underworld&quot; is an effort to elevate style over substance. In the end, it doesn't have either. Watch it with some friends to mock it, but otherwise don't bother.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Adventure Trilogy Transferred Well Onto DVD!"></head><body><p>This widescreen version of the adventure trilogy on standard dvds is very well put together as both the picture and sound quality is very good although for the picture format presented in widescreen means that you should be prepared for the black bars at the top and bottom of the screen.  That doesn't bother me that much and so I found this collection to be a real treat.  The sound quality has clearly benefitted from the THX mastering and the 5.1 surround option completes the viewing experience.  Included is a fourth disc of bonus materials and all four discs fit well into a neat, well designed slipcase.  After viewing this again recently, I've discovered that the films have aged a little and so have lost some of their entertainment value although I thought "The Last Crusade" was still a very good movie to watch and to a lesser extent so was "Raiders of the Lost Ark" but "Temple of Doom" is clearly the weakest of the lot.  I recall that I didn't enjoy it as much when I first saw it in the theatres way back when and sure enough it hasn't aged well and I have to say I still didn't enjoy it watching it again this time around.  Overall though, this is a good way to kick back and escape every now and then.  This pack is a well produced version of all three films in the standard dvd format and I wonder how much better the Blu-ray version will be when they finally get around to releasing that.<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />I've just seen the "Raiders of the Lost Ark" disc from here on a Blu-ray player that enhances standard discs to 1080p and boy is the difference stunning!  The picture quality is very, very good and so is the sound.  I think I won't need to "upgrade" to a Blu-ray version after watching this!<br /><br />Just seen the other two and ditto with respect sound and picture quality for both.</p></body></html>

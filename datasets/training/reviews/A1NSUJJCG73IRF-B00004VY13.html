<meta name="summary" content="The Thing  (1982)"></head><body><p>Director:  John Carpenter<br />Cast:  Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, Richard Dysart.<br />Running Time:  108 minutes.<br />Rated R for violence, gore, and language.<p>This remake of the 1951 classic is so incredibly different and much more grotesque that it bears almost no relation to the original except the title.  The John Carpenter version harnesses the same premise--an otherworldly creature inhabits members of an army radar station crew and proceeds to murder, eat, dismember, etc. all those in the area.  Kurt Russell plays the main protagonist and gives a fine performance in the lead role.<p>John Carpenter (&quot;Halloween&quot;, &quot;Christine&quot;) is a pure master of suspense, using a tense musical score and rigid, unique camera angles for many of his shots.  He also uses much more gore than usual--particularly the scene in which the creatures bursts out of the dog and gruesomely transforms into something new.  Superb makeup and special effects make &quot;The Thing&quot; a disturbing, atmospheric tale of the unknown.  Not much of a plot or theme, just a good old fashioned story with the 1980's gory technology.  Considered by some to a modern classic; considered by others to be a nasty, cruel rendition of a film that did not need a remake.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Real Best Picture of 2006"></head><body><p>In 2006 two major motion pictures about September 11, 2001 were released.  One, WORLD TRADE CENTER, was a film from Oliver Stone about two first responders who were saved from the wreckage of the World Trade Center.  Though WORLD TRADE CENTER is a good and solid film, it does not reach the achievement that Paul Greengrass was able to do with UNITED 93.<br /><br />Filmed in a style that seems to be a dreamy cinema verite (though every moment on film was carefully constructed), UNITED 93 tells the story about the one plane that went down on September 11th that didn't hit its target.  United 93 was supposed to have crashed either into the White House or the Capitol Building, but because of the bravery and courage displayed by the men and women on board, the plane never reached that area and crashed in a field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.  No one alive can say exactly for sure what happened aboard the plane that day.  However, UNITED 93 does an incredible job of recreating what possibly happened.<br /><br />Paul Greengrass and the filmmakers spent an incredible amount of time talking with the family members of those who died.  They listened intently to the tape recordings on board the plane and messages left behind.  I'm sure that hundreds of hours of research went into creating the film and it shows on film.  No big name actors were cast in the film and many of the smaller roles were played by people who had actually been involved somehow with United 93 on September 11th.  It is an ensemble cast of the truest kind.<br /><br />I was deeply moved while watching UNITED 93.  The outcome is already known before even putting the film into the DVD player.  Yet, the foreknowledge takes nothing away from the experience.  The people on the plane reminded me of some of my own friends and family members and even though I knew they were going to die, their actions as portrayed in the film gave me hope.  UNITED 93 is a powerful piece of cinema, testifying to what ordinary people can do when faced against extraordinary circumstances.  The Academy might have ignored it, but UNITED 93 is the best picture of 2006 and a fitting tribute to the men and women who died that day.<br /><br />The DVD includes a commentary with Director Paul Greengrass which I found much more interesting, intriguing, and thought-provoking than many other commentaries I have listened to.  There's also a short documentary entitled "United 93:  The Families and the Film" that interviews family members of those killed and their reactions to the film.  Finally, there is a biography page that includes a small picture and a written biography about the 40 people on board (not including the hijackers) who died because of the hijacking.</p></body></html>

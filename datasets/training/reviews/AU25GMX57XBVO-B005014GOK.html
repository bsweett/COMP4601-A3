<meta name="summary" content="A little violent but fun to watch"></head><body><p>Machete is a fun movie, maybe a little less blood violence and more art would have made it better.  Some of the obnoxious humor was a bit much but does add to it's entertainment.  Seagal has a small role and would have been nice to see him more in the film since it was his first theatrical release in nearly 10 years.  Different type of role for Robert De Niro to play and main character Danny Trejo also had a small role with Seagal in Urban Justice.  Lindsay Lohan helps round out an interesting cast as well.  Not a family movie but for someone who likes a combination of humor and action then think you could enjoy it.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="First pairing of 2 greats: DeNiro and Pacino"></head><body><p>...and what a match. These two consummate actors play cops in this riveting cops-and-robbers flick. DeNiro plays the master thief, while Pacino plays the experienced LA detective who intuits that cop and criminal lead similar lives: both are so fixated on the nuances of their respective professions that they allow their personal lives to suffer. These are 2 men obsessed with the desire to triumph over one another, no matter at what cost.<br />It's a looooong film, nearly 3 hrs, but not a minute of it could be cut without attecting the mood and pacing of this excellent film. It's a crime thriller of the highest order, dispensing equal parts of high thrills and true drama.<br />Not to be missed. DeNiro and Pacino are top notch actors in this top notch movie.</p></body></html>

But the tabloid fodder that this pairing created, along with Jennifer Aniston, will forever be linked to this film, casting a shadow over it. I know some people who refuse to even see this movie because of what happened. I'm not saying you should see this movie, even though I liked it, but you should see it for yourself instead of letting outside forces rule your choices. As far as simple mindled summer/popcorn films go, this one is actually pretty good. It's definitley not great, but it's not bad. It could of been a lot better and they definitley could of taken it a lot further. What I wasn't expecting from the film was the humor. I just didn't think of it being there. But it was and it was nice to have. Kind of a "Lethal Weapon" funny, but not as much. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie star as husband and wife. John and Jane Smith. Can it get any more blander and average?. Both seem to be living the normal upscale suburban life with both of them having careers. What neither of them know is that both are top assassins, and when they leave for work in the morning, they are killing people and blowing things up. Things get a little nasty when both of their agencies find out about their marriage and decide that it's not good image-wise, and set up a plan for the two to take each other out. The duo find out and start battling, until they realize they really love each other and team up to stay alive. The premise of the movie is pretty fun and it definitley has potential for a lot of great set up. Fortunatley, some of that potential is here. Unfortunatley, it's not enough. The movie moves along pretty quickly and once things really kick in, there is not a real dull moment. But the movie is not as big and explosive and memorable as it wants, or should, be. The direction is pretty slick though and well done, and our two stars are game. I haven't seen a lot of Brad Pitt films, but he fits real well into his role. Jolie is a little more cold. However, she is incredibly sexy here. Vince Vaughan has a small suppoting role as a friend/co-worker of Pitt's, and Adam Brody from "The O.C." puts in a small side role as well. The presence of our two stars brings a lot to the table, and there is enough humorous moments and big action pieces to entertain. But it could of been so much more.</p></body></html>

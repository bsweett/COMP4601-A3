<meta name="summary" content="Taxi Driver"></head><body><p>Scorsese's dark vision of human alienation in an urban wasteland captures the seaminess of pre-Giuliani Manhattan, and DeNiro's career-making performance as Bickle is haunting, recalling those real-life outcasts who have used violent crime to tell an oblivious world: "I was here!". Stunningly directed and acted, this picture is every bit as disturbing now as when released. Brilliant, but not for the faint of heart.</p></body></html>

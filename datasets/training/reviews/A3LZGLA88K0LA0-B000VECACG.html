<meta name="summary" content="MASHED POTATOES AND MORE"></head><body><p>CLOSE ENCOUNTERS is another one of Steven Spielberg's innocent looks at children and aliens, as in ET.  This classic is a superior example of good filmmaking, with its rather thin plot overshadowed by its wonderful direction and Richard Dreyfuss' marvelous performance.  Also note the fine support from Teri Garr and Melinda Dillon; their presence gives the movie a foundation of family ideals.  The scene where Dreyfuss makes his mashed potatoes into a replica of Devil's Peak is still one of the most memorable in science fiction films.  John Williams' score is as always impeccable and the effects state of the art.  A lot doesn't really "happen" in the movie, but its view of friendly aliens and contact with we earthlings still gives it classic status.</p></body></html>

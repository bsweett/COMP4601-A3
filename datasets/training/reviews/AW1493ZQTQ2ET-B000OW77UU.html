There are no significant flaws which threaten to ruin the movie.<br /><br />Turning to the story itself, as most people know, this movie is "inspired by a true story" involving a man who faces enormous financial hardships, to the point where he and his son wind up homeless.  The problems he encounters are so relentless that it becomes almost too painful to watch.  But he's gifted at math, has good interpersonal skills, and works incredibly hard, so he eventually winds up with a nice job in a San Francisco financial firm, and later goes on to start his own firm and become a multi-millionaire.<br /><br />A story like this will naturally appeal to an American audience because it taps in to the meritocratic notion that the American dream is accessible to most of us if we're willing to work hard and make sacrifices.  But we can question how much this moving and inspiring story can really serve as a model for the masses.  I would say not much.  In a country of 300 million people, you'll always be able to find stories like this, but they're the exception, not the norm, and of course that's what makes this story worthy of a movie.  Moreover, the main character clearly had abilities and a work ethic far beyond the norm, so it took very special strengths to prevail over such especially bad luck.  But I do think this story illustrates the upper limits of what's possible, and most people can draw the lesson that working hard will still provide at least some benefit, even if the benefit falls short of one's ultimate dreams.<br /><br />Another lesson which is perhaps equally important is that children may value and need our love and attention more than the material resources we can provide.  That's certainly the case in this story, and I suspect that this can be generalized to most children.  Something to consider for dads (and moms) who are preoccupied with putting in long hours away from home in order to make a lot of money ...<br /><br />Highly recommended to anyone looking for an uplifting story, even if few people can replicate an ending as happy as this one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Godfather of Spy movies? Thriller?"></head><body><p>This movie was called, the Godfather of Spy movies and a thriller. I question both. First of all, the only thing it had in common with the Godfather is that three people got wacked, DeNiro was in it and it was really long at 2 hours and 47 minutes. Oh, and it has Joe Pesci in it too, who has been known to cohoot with the mobster types.<br /><br />Thriller? There was absolutely nothing thrilling about it. In fact, it was very slow and tedious. It starts off interesting, showing how Edward Wilson (Matt Damon) was recruited and indoctrinated into the world of spying and the elite secret group "the Skull & Bones". It also has an interesting Love story between Wilson, Clover (Angelina Jolie) & a shy deaf girl named Laura (Tammy Blanchard).<br /><br />The problem with the film is that it didn't need to be nearly 3 hours long. It really didn't. The movie had no elements of intrigue or hook. It was just a series of events that showed how the life of a spy slowly and systematically destroyed a good man.<br /><br />The film is well filmed and well acted, I'm not knocking these elements of the film. It was just boring.<br /><br />To make a long story short, which DeNiro (who directed the film) should have done, the movie could have been shortened dramatically. After about an hour and forty minutes of the film, I found myself hitting the fast forward button and fully understanding everything that was speeding past my eyes.<br /><br />There's nothing wrong with long movies, but you better have something that keeps your interest. Had I gone to see this at the movie theatre, I would have slept or left. Seriously.</p></body></html>

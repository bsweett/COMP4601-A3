<meta name="summary" content="STUNNING FILM"></head><body><p>WINTER'S BONE is one of 2010's most honored movies earning 4 Oscar noms including Picture, Actress and supporting actor---and they deserve it.<br />Jennifer Lawrence is brilliant in her emotionally mature performance as the determined Ree.  With just a look, she melts your heart.  John Hawkes is superb as her druggie uncle who manages to convey both fear and compassion.  The whole ensemble is perfect.<br />WINTER's BONE is a grim, unflinching look at family relationships and trapped people, but it is also moving and tender.  Ree's love for her family is inspiring.<br />WINTER's BONE probably won't win any Oscars but it's a stunning movie.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</p></body></html>

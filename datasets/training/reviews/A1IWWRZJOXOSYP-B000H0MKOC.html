His teeth are all sunshine and front words that exist in a moral vacuum called the profit motive.  The film satirically highlights how profit motive must be tempered with service motive.  Eckhart is famous for his work with Neil La Bute such as "In the Company of Men."  He has also branched into other films like "Erin Brockovich" & "The Black Dahlia."  He deserved his Best Actor Golden Globe nomination for this film.  His son is played by Cameron Bright who was the creepy reincarnated soul of Nicole Kidman in "Birth" and has also appeared in "X-Men 3" & "Ultraviolet."  Nick's best friends are also lobbyists, Maria Bello ("Assault on Precinct 13" & "A History of Violence") plays Polly Bailey and Saturday Night Live's David Koechner plays Bobby Jay Bliss.  William H. Macy plays a neurotic senator; Robert Duvall is the Captain of tobacco; Sam Elliott's the Marlboro Man Lorne Lutch; and Rob Lowe is the Hollywood super-agent Jeff Megall.  For his first directorial project, Jason Reitman creates a funny, offbeat comedy that certainly twists our moral expectations.  There are plenty of deleted scenes for an excellent special feature.  "Thank You for Smoking" is hilariously drawn.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

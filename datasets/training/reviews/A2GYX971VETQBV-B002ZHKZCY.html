<meta name="summary" content="Forget the "Shaky-Cam": This Sequel Lacks Heart"></head><body><p>Well, I won't bore you all with another long rant about the shaky camera sequences and split-second scene changes.  They're both in here all over the place and I have my own qualms with them.  But honestly, folks, does this make or break the film for you?  If anything, I believe that all of the commentary on the "shaky-cam" techniques points to a far deeper problem lurking in THE BOURNE SUPREMACY: the lack of a logical and interesting plotline.  Sure, there are some pluses in this film.  I really enjoy watching Matt Damon as an action/spy hero.  He's good at it and believable.  I love seeing him take out squadrons of men with a few martial arts moves and escape from impossible situations with ease and flare.  He handles the dueling characteristics of brains and brawn quite well and can also handle women.  I just wish that he would do so inside of a film that made sense and was interesting.<br /><br />Of course, I am not asking for a completely realistic action film.  Such a thing is impossible, perhaps, and would be boring if it were actually accomplished.  No...what I ask for is simply an entertaining action storyline that flows from point-to-point with logical grace and simplicity.  Much of the storyline in THE BOURNE SUPREMACY is simply hard to follow and extraneous.  We love to see our action hero fighting against the best of the best.  We just want to know why he is doing it.<br /><br />I honestly hope that we have not seen the last of Jason Bourne.  Matt Damon is very interesting to watch and I feel that with a better plotline this series can be recovered.  If you enjoyed THE BOURNE IDENTITY, you'll want to check out this film.  But for several reasons I feel that THE BOURNE SUPREMACY is inferior to its predecessor.  Let's hope a third can reclaim Bourne's identity among the great spy flicks of all time.</p></body></html>

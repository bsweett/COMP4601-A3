As the name suggests this is about a train run amok laden with toxic chemicals and heading straight for a populated town. This is a movie where one can easily speculate the end but the film succeeds because it was partially based on real life experiences, the editing, action sequences and the direction stand out. The lead actors do not have much to do but play out the age old rookie and veteran roles. I could not take my eyes away from the screen; the last time this happened to me was when I watched `Speed' many years ago. Four stars. 4/22/2011</p></body></html>

When you can see actual snowflakes against a snow-white background, you know that real care went into the video transfer.  And for a movie nearly 25 years old, the 5.1 sound still packs a punch, although the center channel lacks some of today's aural presence.  The standard special edition DVD looked great, but this one blows it out of the water!</p></body></html>

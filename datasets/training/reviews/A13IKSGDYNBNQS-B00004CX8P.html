<meta name="summary" content="Eastwood classic"></head><body><p>Clint Eastwoods last ever western is one of the best ever made. Its not a typical Eastwood western as its take on violence and the results of violence is markedly different from the many previous westerns that Eastwood has been involved in.<br /><br />Early in the film you quickly realise that this is something completly different. Eastwood's character William Munny can't even get on a horse. This scene is the first of many with a running black comedy element. Even without that element the film has other differences, such as the fact that a lot of the characters are very simple folk and as a result use simple language.<br /><br />In 1992 this film was nominated for 9 oscars and won 4 of them. Gene Hackman who plays Little Bill Daggett (the town Sheriff) deservedly won the best supporting actor role for his performance. Like most films he appeared in in the late 1980's (Mississipi Burning being perhaps his best of the late 80's) Hackman's performance is memerisingly good and as I mentioned earlier in places there are some lovely black comedy moments.<br /><br />With Morgan Freeman and Richard Harris, as well as Eastwood himself, all giving excellent performances this is a film thats worth seeing over and over. Without doubt a western masterpiece and currently ranked 117 in the IMDB top 250 films.</p></body></html>

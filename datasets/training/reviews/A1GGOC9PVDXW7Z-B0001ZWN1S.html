Take the cannoli.""></head><body><p>Sofia Coppola, who plays Michael Corleone's daughter in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007Y08NI">THE GODFATHER Part III</a>, is in this original picture the infant son of Connie (Talia Shire) who's being baptised during the picture's final bloodbath. Sofia's grandmother (Italia) has a bit part and grandfather Carmine, composer of the movie's classic music, is the piano player seen in the gang war montage.<br /><br />Francis Coppola's epic may be the finest Mafia-related film of all and is in the running for the best movie of the 1970s. As author Mario Puzo describes it, this is the story of a king and his three sons, but it's far more than that.<br /><br />A sweeping saga set in Sicily, New York and Las Vegas, Vito Corleone's tragedy-filled childhood helped mold the man we meet several decades later. His oldest boy, hot-headed Sonny, takes over when Vito is victim of a mob hit. Sonny himself is betrayed by an in-law and gunned down on the parkway, and youngest son Michael reluctantly takes the reins of power. He proves an able Don, the right man to succeed Vito in the family "business." An outstanding all-star cast in this must-see crime drama.<br /><br />Also available in an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019L770A">official restored version</a>.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(9.2) The Godfather (1972) - Marlon Brando/Al Pacino/James Caan/Richard S.

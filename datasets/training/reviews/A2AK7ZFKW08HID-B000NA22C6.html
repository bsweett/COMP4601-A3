Johnny Depp is such a talented actor, he really makes you believe he is being driven mad. Alot of Stephen Kings fans really hate on the movies that are based on his books, I on the other hand enjoy them and many of them are really good, if they would just stop comparing them to the books and watch them for what they are ("BASED ON") they might actually enjoy them.</p></body></html>

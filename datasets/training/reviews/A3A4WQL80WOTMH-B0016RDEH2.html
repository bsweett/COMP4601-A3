Seriously trippy - and violent too.  Watch a large preying mantis-like wood bug change into a fairy and lead you into the dark woods and 'the labyrinth'.  Yes, it could almost be a fairy tale - in the modern sense of the word - but for the violence, which is quite severe in places.  In that regard, it is more like the original faery tales long before they were Disnified, and which could also be somewhat gruesome. Set in Franco's Spain at the end of world war II, the story follows a young girl's entrance into a magical world as a cruel dictator, her would-be step-father, wages war against rebels in the forest outside.  Not for the kiddies.  There is a heavy kind of menace and violence that helps convince and adds weight to the story in the right places.  Bloody yet swift-moving, it is a tale cloaked in layers of art, symbolism, spirituality and * magic *.  What a rich tone this movie has - so full of dark and light, a masterpiece of color.  The fact that it is in Spanish (English subtitles) really does enhance its mystique and somehow gives greater authenticity to its magic.  A very potent movie.</p></body></html>

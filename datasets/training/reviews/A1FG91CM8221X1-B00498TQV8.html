<meta name="summary" content="A bleak, brilliant folk tale."></head><body><p>The theme of innocence unprotected, fighting for its life, is one of the oldest and most potent in fiction. Debra Granik's film "Winter's Bone," based on a novel by Daniel Woodrell, is a bleak, unforgettable folk tale about a teenage girl whose struggle for survival takes her to dark places few people ever have the misfortune to see.<br /><br />Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence), a 17-yer-old girl in the Missouri Ozarks, has dropped out of school to care for her younger siblings and her severely depressed, catatonic mother. Deserted by her methamphetamine-cooking father Jessup, Ree manages to keep the family going until the day the sheriff (Garret Dillahunt) shows up at their cabin. Jessup has skipped bail, the sheriff tells her, and he put up the cabin as surety. Jessup has one week to show up in court, or the cabin is forfeit.<br /><br />"Winter's Bone" is the story of Ree's desperate search for her father to prevent her family from being thrown out into the woods. This search, without going into plot points, costs her dearly. The Ozarks are already a place where people learn early to mind their business and not to go snooping in other peoples'. Add meth dealing to the picture, and the situation turns deadly. Ree finds scant sympathy from her neighbors and even her own extended family. Her scary Uncle Teardrop (John Hawkes) makes it excruciatingly plain that her questions are unwelcome. Yet Teardrop's reaction is mild compared with that of the even scarier people he works for. "We warned you," Merab (Dale Dickey), wife of the local meth boss, tells Ree. "Why didn't you listen?"<br /><br />"Winter's Bone" is a masterful film, seamlessly mixing delicate lyricism and white-knuckle suspense. The acting is superb down to the smallest bit part. Nineteen-year-old Jennifer Lawrence, in her first starring role, scarcely seems to be acting; she really seems to be this frail girl, armed only with courage and a fierce love of her family, facing down monsters. Blessed with an uncommonly smart, poignant music score from a number of Ozarks musicians, "Winter's Bone" is the best film so far this year, and it seems unlikely that any film will exceed it.It has already won major prizes at the Sundance and Berlin film festivals; here's hoping it can add an Oscar or two to the tally.</p></body></html>

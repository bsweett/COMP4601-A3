Some of the special effects were very cool but when you stop being awed by the cinematography and take a step back you realize how shoddy the construction of this movie is.  Plot threads lead everywhere and were never really effectively resolved.  There was no chemistry between any of the actors, every single person in the cast played their roles sort of tongue and check like they were expecting the other person to bust out laughing.<br /><br />The movie would not annoy me so much if not for the moronic choice of villains.  I can forgive wooden acting to a certain extent I cannot forgive wooden pointless villains.  Any time the plot actually threatened to break into new territory one of the idiotic villains would show up and ruin the moment.  If these guys were supposed to scare me or make me root for the Brothers why was I rolling my eyes when the bad guys said their lines?  Why use French people as the main point of conflict in the movie?  A lot of things in this movie don't make a whole not of sense but this is probably the biggest point.<br /><br />Bottom line-Not good, not awful I don't hate myself for watching it in the theater but I am certainly not wasting my time with it ever agian.</p></body></html>

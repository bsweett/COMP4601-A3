<meta name="summary" content="Better then the first, but it needs something."></head><body><p>Althought this movie is pretty gosh darn good, it still has flaws but what movie doesnt, besides LOTR.  The special effects are astonishing, the planets and ships are done very well, probably the only thing goin to get an oscar nom is the effects.  The action is cool but a bit quick and could use some more slow mo, or something, the fights are well choreographed and there are some cool stunts and explosions.  The story is a bit complicated but understandable and interesting.  The performances aren't to good here, vin does a belivable but kind of boring performance, and no body else really shines, the old lady is alright, but vin probably gives the best performance.  Overall its a very well done sci fi action movie, the f/x and fights stand out more then anything else(which is a good thing, but maybe the rest of the movie could use a little more attention) so i give it an 8 out of a 10, and its definetly worth a look, i would wait for the extended dvd though the director already said he is goin to release a longer version of the film which is what i plan to get.</p></body></html>

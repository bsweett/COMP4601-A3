<meta name="summary" content="One Of The Best Trek Films Ever...Very Entertaining"></head><body><p>STAR TREK IV: The Voyage Home is considered one of the most entertaining Star Trek films of our time, and it's considered a success due in large part to Leonard Nimoy's directorial efforts and the great interaction between the cast members, especially Kirk and Spock...who, together, provide some funny moments.<p>We pick up where STAR TREK III left off, with Kirk and McCoy and Crew on the planet with the rejuvenated Spock ready to leave on the Klingon bird of prey. When they encounter a mysterious probe in their travels, they decipher it to realize that it is actually the song of a humpback whale. They travel back to Earth to San  Francisco, where we have some of the greatest moments between Kirk and Spock as they travel in San Francisco in search of the woman who is trying to save the whales from being extinct. The crew of the Enterprise comes together to save the humpbacks and it brings some good action into the film, but this is more about the human interaction between the characters in the film, and not so much about the action. It's a refreshing approach, and it gives the film a lot of strength.<p>STAR TREK IV: The Voyage Home is a thoroughly enjoyable film from beginning to end, with a better premise and more enjoyable plot then the film to follow. Consider this: The Voyage Home is considered the best film in the Trek series, but I believe that honor goes to The Wrath of Khan. However, that doesn't mean Star Trek IV isn't as good; The Voyage Home is just as good a film, and makes for a wonderful addition to any Trekkie's film collection.</p></body></html>

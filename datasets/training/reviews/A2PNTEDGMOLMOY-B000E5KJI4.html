<meta name="summary" content="Grand Battle Scenes Help Mediocre Translation of Iliad"></head><body><p>Wolfgang Petersen's "Troy" bears all the hallmarks of a major studio production for a summer blockbuster.  Thousands of soldiers clash in violent battle scenes, plenty of beefcake and cheesecake to go around (but not too racy as to potentially offend anyone), famous and semi-famous actors even in marginal roles, and more than a bit of romance.  All this points to the good, but the problem is that in taking this perspective to the battle of Troy, Petersen and his team generally gutted the "Iliad," which is only one of the foundations of the Western Canon and with plenty of devoted fans.<br /><br />Brad Pitt's Achilles is the best example of how "Troy" fundamentally changed a major character.  Pitt's Achilles is no longer a semi-immortal, beloved of the Gods and vulnerable only in the heel that his mother held when she dipped him in the River Styx.  Instead, he's "just" the best warrior out there.  Pitt's Achilles is no longer the desperately vain hero of the "Iliad," but instead is a thoughtful man given to internal anguish over things like loyalty, duty, and the like.  Also abandoned is Achilles' love for his friend Patroclus -- rather than touch upon any hint of homosexuality, the script makes Achilles and Patroclus cousins.  This doesn't quite work as justification for Achilles' rage after Patroclus' death -- as more than one Trojan points out to Achilles, how many cousins, father, sons, and brothers have you killed, you hypocrite?  I can't say Pitt was miscast as Achilles, given Pitt's excellent work in other films -- the character was just poorly written.  His sacrifice for the maiden Briseas is just plain wrong, but it gives Pitt a chance for a "Hollywood" dying speech . . . yeesh.<br /><br />"Troy" also completely abandons the role of the Greek gods in the battle, which dismisses one of the major plot lines in the "Iliad."  I'm sure this was done for the sake of getting the movie completed in under 3 hours -- there are already a lot of characters to begin with -- but the Gods elevate the battle of Troy from mere tale to the level of myth, and their absence is telling.  Indeed, the Trojans, with the exception of Hector (a stoic Eric Bana), are generally led to their downfall to their devotion to "the Gods," who never show up, while the Greeks are motivated by more worldly (and therefore practical) considerations.<br /><br />The movie gets many things right, even as it rewrites the story. Paris and Helen, whose affair starts the whole bloody mess, are as passive and self-absorbed as they are in the "Iliad" -- note how Paris (Orlando Bloom) continually fails to rise to the occasion.  Other characters who shine in the "Iliad," such as Odysseus, Nestor, Ajax, and Menelaus, are not given nearly as much time to shine and are used generally as plot devices.<br /><br />There are several solid performances in "Troy," particularly Brian Cox as the dastardly Agamemnon and Peter O'Toole as the wizened Priam, and if you're not that familiar with the "Iliad," you will probably be able to enjoy "Troy" more on its own merits than someone who is really bothered by the fact that "Troy" takes place over a few weeks while the "Iliad" recounts the last year in a ten-year battle.<br /><br />The DVD looks great, and the battle scenes are enjoyable even if they don't rise to the recent heights established by Peter Jackson's "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy.<br /><br />All in all, "Troy" is a good movie that somewhat disappoints because it could have been great.  Unfortunately, by trying to make a blockbuster, the filmmakers trimmed corners and softened the edges of one of the great tales of Western Civilization . . . maybe they should have respected the fact that Homer has had considerable box office appeal for over 3,000 years.</p></body></html>

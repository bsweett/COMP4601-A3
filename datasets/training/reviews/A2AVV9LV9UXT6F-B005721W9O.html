<meta name="summary" content="Hilarious parody of "Star Trek" et al."></head><body><p>The humor in this movie works on two levels.  First is the comedy that results from the movie's basic premise: a bunch of TV actors suddenly find themselves in exactly the same sorts of adventures they used to act out on screen, only now it's real.  But second, and even funnier in my opinion, is the humor derived from parodying the entire world of science fiction, and its all to often rabid, religiously devoted fans.<br /><br />It also showcases the darker side of being involved with a pop-culture phenomenon: actors who become so closely identified with their roles, they find they simply can't get work doing anything else.  I imagine the real cast of "Star Trek" could feel how close to the mark this hits (and George Reeves, TV's Superman of the 1950s, may have even killed himself in despair at suffering this fate).  The most memorable scene in the movie for me was Alan Rickman's delivery of the line "By Grabthar's Hammer, I've never seen such savings."  His rigid posture, hesitant speech, and stony facial expression are hilarious.  He's a classicly trained actor who's become pigeonholed in a role he considers beneath him, and he has been reduced to the humiliation of uttering childish drivel at store openings.  For all that much of the movie is made in the spirit of William Shatner's famous SNL "get a life" skit, the movie takes an affectionate look at fans, and two sci-fi geeks even provide indispensible help to the heroes in the end.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant"></head><body><p>This film based on Thomas Harris's masterpiece of a novel, is equally a masterpiece. Hopkins and Foster deliver Oscar winning performances and the adapted screenplay from the novel is great, leaving in all of the best moments.<br /><br />Hopkins stars as Hannibal Lecter, an imprisoned cannibal, who is interviewed by Agent Clarice Starling, played by Foster. He is interviewed by her on information on a series of killings. She asks information on "Buffalo Bill", a killer who skins women. Hannibal aggrees, but in return asks for personal information on Starling. Starling doesn't know though whether Lecter is just playing with her or whether or not he is giving true information. When a senator's daughter gets kidnapped, the chase is on.<br /><br />I am about to give away an event which some people may not want to know before watching this film.<br /><br />The movie contains the best scene of all time, that beeing Hannibal's escape; while the conclusion is absolutely brilliant. This thriller is heart pounding and smart and fast, and is recommended to everyone. It is my favorite movie of all time, and I recommend reading the book also as it gives away more interesting information.</p></body></html>

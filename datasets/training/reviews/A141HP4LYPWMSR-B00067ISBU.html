The '04 cinematic release of `Hellboy' definitely brought new meaning and dimension (dimension, get it?) to the superhero film genre and the never ending battle between Good and Evil.<br /><br />The storyline contains all the elements the astute comic book fan or student of the esoteric and arcane would expect; nightmarish locations and stormy nights, magical incantations and prophetic utterances of impending doom, animated corpses and demonic entities, portals to the Otherworld and of course plenty of Nazis. Add to the mix the mad monk Rasputin, the awakening ot the Lovecraftian "Seven Gods of Chaos" and you've got a Cosmic confrontation on your hands that only the likes of Hellboy can withstand.<br /><br />This movie has it all, well developed storyline, superb special effects with an entertaining mixture of action sequences and witty, intelligent dialogue delivering a lot of quotable dialogue. Ron Perlman is absolutely perfect as Hellboy and under the magnificent direction of Guillermo del Toro it was truly a match made in Heaven (sorry, couldn't resist)!</p></body></html>

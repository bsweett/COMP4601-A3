<meta name="summary" content="Bridesmaids"></head><body><p>I did not care for Superbad or KnockedUp or similar comedies and movies,sadly new style comedy isn't doing it for me,Bridesmaids is semi-Funny and geared towards a female audience from a vulgar point of view at times.Maya Rudolph I had to do a double take on her cause' she looked nothing like her former self and Sadly Newer SNL is not funny so I don't really care for actors from the New SNL.I watched it cause it was a freebie and it seemed to fill the time but It wouldn't be something I'd go outta of my way to purchase.</p></body></html>

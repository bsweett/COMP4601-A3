<meta name="summary" content="An amazingly delicious fish taco from a truck"></head><body><p>This is an amazing movie. If you took parts of Itchy & Scratchy, GTA San Andreas, Blaxploitation movies of the 70s, and bad porn, and then had it stirred up, dipped in batter, and deep fried by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez's unholy spawn, you get this stupidly perfect movie.<br /><br />Some of the scenes in this insane grindhouse fest will have you pause, rewind, re-watch, and repeat: they are that freaking over-the-top. There were at least a half dozen literal jaw-dropping, eye-bulging, WOW moments. I wish I could share some of the great moments but they have to be witnessed in stunned amazement as I did, without any preparation.<br /><br />Now let's get this straight; this movie has almost no genuine redeeming cinematic qualities. The plot is ridiculous, the script inane, there is no semblance of reality, and there is a moronically heavy handed pro-illegal immigrant message.  However, there is a reason this movie boasts big names and I'm pretty sure it wasn't for the paycheck or the chance to get an Oscar. It's because this is pure artery-clogging joy. If you feel the need to critique this movie you probably also look for the sanitary qualities of a truck taco. I don't know about you, but some of the best food I've ever eaten came from a truck. I can't sum it up any better than that.</p></body></html>

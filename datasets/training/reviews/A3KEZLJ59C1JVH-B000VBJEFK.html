Remy, a very likeable rat, has a gourmet nose and amazing culinary skills. Sadly, his dreams of becoming a chef seem pretty farfetched due to the limitations of his species. However, Remy eventually teams up with Linguini, a gangly young man who lands a job as a garbage boy in one of the most famous restaurants in Paris. Linguini is quite possibly the worst cook ever, but he and Remy devise a method of working together in the kitchen: Remy hides under Linguini's white chef's hat and tugs on the boy's hair to give him commands. As a result, Linguini quickly becomes one of the most sought-after cooks in all of Paris, with a lot of help from his "little chef."<br /><br />Even though this is a Pixar/Disney film, there's something about it that reminds me of the classic animated cartoons from many, many years ago (you know, when Disney cartoons were actually good). "Ratatouille" is visually stunning and a joy to watch. The characters appear to be three-dimensional, and the beautiful Parisian scenery is a great background throughout the film. There are so many amazing characters in this movie, too: scruffy and adorable Remy, bumbling Linguini, sassy Colette, and Skinner (my personal favorite), an angry little man who reminds me of a non-monkey version of Mojo Jojo from "The Powerpuff Girls."<br /><br />I loved, loved, LOVED this movie! It's a very solid story that's chock full of smart humor, colorful characters, and lots of action and excitement. This is a movie that kids and adults will enjoy very much. I plan to go see it again in the theatre.</p></body></html>

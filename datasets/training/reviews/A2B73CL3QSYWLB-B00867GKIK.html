In a word, it was one of the best films of 2009, period.  Aside from terrific visuals and a great story this film makes cogent observations about aging and loneliness as well as the value of friendship.  My parents, in their seventies now, loaned this movie to me.  They bought it after taking the grandkids to see it.  I conclude this review by saying, "Thanks, Mom and Dad!".</p></body></html>

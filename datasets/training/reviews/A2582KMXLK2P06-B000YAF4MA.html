It starts off rather slow, because the two characters wanted to build up a relationship and establish a storyline while they stayed in the hospital, but if you're willing to wait 30 minutes or so, the interesting parts of the story get going, and you begin to see a very original and interesting style of story-telling involving a combination of emotion and comedy.<br /><br />One thing you can pretty much count on from the very beginning is to be crying by the time the film reaches its conclusion.  You pretty much KNOW you'll be crying by the end, and that the happiness between the two characters isn't going to stay like that forever.<br /><br />I will say I agree with the many reviewers that the film deserves to be considered one of the very best written films of the year.  It does every single thing right from the storytelling, to the emotions, to keeping the viewers watching.  It's just a great movie.</p></body></html>

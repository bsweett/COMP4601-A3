I felt transported back to a time in history when science and superstition were practically brothers in the minds of most men.  "The Prestige" bridges these two perspectives nicely to the point that one begins to think that magic really does exist where these two competing magicians are concerned.  Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale carry the film splendidly, even during the very slow moments, with Michael Caine and the lovely Scarlett Johansson pitching in occasionally to give the story added lift.  This is the second film that director Christopher Nolan has worked with Christian Bale, the first being "Batman Begins", and as in that film the photography in "The Prestige" is equally dark and evocative.  Christopher Nolan also directed two other deliberately paced films, "Memento" and "Insomnia".  "The Prestige" is appropriately draped in shadows, secrecy, and deceit.  I saw this movie in the theater and by the time it ended with a surprising plot twist I knew that I would have to see it again when it came out on DVD just to see what I missed the first time around.  The pace of "The Presitge" is slow going, but I found the film overall to be very satisfying.  Recommended.</p></body></html>

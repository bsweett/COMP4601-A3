I'm not a huge fan of the comic books so any complaints that others have about the weak characters doesn't apply to me.  I still think Halle Berry is a pretty flat actress so the fact that Storm had such a huge role in this movie was a big drawback for me.  But other than that, I thought it was good. It was action-packed and entertaining the whole way through, which is all I was looking for.  If you're a huge fan of the whole X-Men franchise, I've heard from friends who are Marvel devotees that this one was a disappointment.  However, if you're just looking for a night in with a good movie I think you'll be pleasantly entertained.</p></body></html>

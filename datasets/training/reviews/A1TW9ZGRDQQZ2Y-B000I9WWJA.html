<meta name="summary" content="A Very Solid Movie With Great Acting"></head><body><p>Denzel Washington is really, really good in this film. It is one of his best performances in a long while. Clive Owen is good as usual and Jodie Foster makes the most out of her small role. Inside Man also boasts a clever story with realistic dialogue (you won't get any Tarantino lines here), some of which had the theater laughing in a good way. The twist was unique, but it wasn't that mind blowing. I don't regret spending $7.00 and two and a half hours of my day on this film. This is one of the few Spike Lee films that I enjoyed from beginning to end.</p></body></html>

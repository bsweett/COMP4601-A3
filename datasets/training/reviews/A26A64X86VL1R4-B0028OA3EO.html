Some of us who loved the Christopher Reeves' Superman expressed reservations about this latest version.  There is no need to be concerned.  Brandon Routh takes a few scenes to get used to but ultimately was quite good and fits well into the mythic pantheon of Superman.  He is a young Superman and though very handsome his appearance is not perfect.  In some shots his nose looks a bit large for his face and his eyebrows distractingly thick; from other angles he has the perfect profile.  This does not detract from his screen presence, quite the reverse; it created an interesting tension as to how he would appear next.<br /><br />The story is well-crafted and provides the right touches at the right times.  Superman has never been quite so human; he is clearly moved and tears come to his eyes at a key moment in the story.  His devotion to humanity is conveyed by his gentle touch--he very tenderly and slowly sets rescued victims down, commences to fly softly without excess noise and fuss.  This makes his feats of speed and strength by contrast even more astonishing.  A wonderful moment is when a villain shoots him in the eye and we are shown a close-up of the bullet flattening on his retina--a special effect applauded with glee in the movie theatre.<br /><br />Superman is a superhero of contrasts--he has several moments where he uses all his strength and needs human aid but quickly recovers.  Yet he can be stern.  When he pursues a particular villain he cracks the earth when he touches down.  His flying scene with Lois Lane, while manifestly erotic, does not overplay the moment leaving you wanting more.<br /><br />Casting Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor is a masterly touch.  While it seems like Spacey plays this role with consummate ease, he nevertheless provides the right touch of supercilious villainy to keeps the role from being a caricature.  Kate Bosworth as Lois is fine, she neither captivates nor annoys and there is reasonably good chemistry between her and Superman.  Eva Marie Saint provides a charismatic Martha, unfortunately we don't see enough of her.<br /><br />In sum, all you can expect from a good summer movie--action, suspense, romance and a surprise ending.</p></body></html>

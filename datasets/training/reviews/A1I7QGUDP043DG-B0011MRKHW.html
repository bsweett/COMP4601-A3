<meta name="summary" content="Well done Cate!"></head><body><p>There have been so many versions of Queen Elizabeth's life, but I believe this one will stand out. I loved Clive Owen as Sir Walter Raleigh, and of course Cate was superb. A young queen is torn between her country and allowing herself to fall in love or be loved.  Focusing on her country at a time when her throne and people need her undivided attention is an intense, bittersweet glance into another Era.  When Elizabeth is tricked into allowing her cousin, Mary, Queen of Scotland, to be sentenced to death and beheaded, Elizabeth's spirit and ability to face and fight the mighty Armada of Spain are fully tested.<br /><br />Chrissy K.

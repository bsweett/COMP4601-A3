<meta name="summary" content="Very Good Movie in Spite of All the Hype"></head><body><p>OK, it's a good movie. Maybe not quite as fabulously great as the hype about it, but it's good.<br /><br />Jamal is a Mumbai street kid along with his brother Salim. Although Salim is reluctant, they rescue a little girl named Latika. The ways in which they get used, abused and exploited are depressing, but they are smart, resourceful and courageous. They get separated, for which Jamal blames Salim (justifiably), and Latika is taken over by a brutal SOB who just happens to be Salim's employer.<br /><br />But Jamal never gave up on finding her. In fact, he says at one point that he went on the TV show "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" mostly because he figured she would be watching. He knows the answers to the questions, much to everyone's surprise because he is supposedly uneducated and ignorant. But he has a superb memory, and in a series of flashbacks, he explains to a policeman who is trying to charge him with cheating how he knew the answer to each question. Does he know the answer to the last one, for a prize of 20 million rupees? Is Latika watching? Will they get back together at last?<br /><br />It is written.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One Of The Better Hollywood Films In A Long Time"></head><body><p>Cast Away is something rare and special in Hollywood. It's an epic Hollywood blockbuster type with a name actor and director that is actually brilliant, classy, and worth all of it. Usually, those types of films are hollow and eye candy. That's okay too, you know. This film shows that they can also be the exact opposite. Tom Hanks stars as Chuck Noland, a fed-ex worker who goes on a flight for a delivery and the plane crashes into the sea. Chuck drifts(on an inflatible boat)to a remote island. Chuck ends up spending four years on that island. His only companion is a volleyball named Wilson. Chuck wonders about his girlfriend back home, who's played by Helen Hunt. Hanks' performance is a one man showstopper. He proves again why he is such a loved and respected performer. He deserves all of the attention and respect. He deserved the Oscar instead of Russell Crowe. Crowe wasn't anything stand-outish. If Hanks hadn't of won twice already, he would've won this too. Helen Hunt is usually good, but she is given way less to do here to really review. Her end scenes with Hanks are pretty good tho. This movie defied all odds. It was one man on a deserted island for the majority of the film. Tons of film were without dialogue and music. Very risky and brave. Director Robert Zemeckis pulled it off brilliantly. He always does. This is a great, up-lifting, spiritual film that would make anybody feel better about themselves for seeing this. This is a Hollywood classic. Do yourself a favor and forget about &quot;Survivor&quot;. This film is the way it should be. A must see.</p></body></html>

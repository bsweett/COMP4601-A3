Cunningham had every intention of making a buck with this gory little movie that truly launched the slasher craze of the early 80s.  That he made a cinematic legend was strictly an accident.<p>John Carpenter's Halloween had proved to be a huge hit just a year or two previous to this film and making a similar slaughter date movie to cash in on the trend seemed a good idea.  So Friday the 13th (another 'bad date' title) was born.<p>Like Halloween the movie starts with the post coital murder of two sneak away lovers, roll credits and jump forward to 'The Present'.  A well meaning camp counselor is trying to reopen Camp Crystal Lake much to the distaste of the locals, for it is there that the pre-credit murders happened.  It seems that so much bad luck has befallen camps in the area that just about everyone agrees that it must have a death curse.  Boy have they got that right.  For someone is lurking in the woods, watching and stalking the gathering counselors, and when night falls and a storm rolls in, the killer pounces.  Again and again the blood flows freely at Camp Crystal Lake.<p>Nothing more than a simplistic low budget exploitation shocker, Friday the 13th's biggest controversy wasn't its sex and graphic bloodletting, but that a major Hollywood studio (Paramount) would even buy the distribution rights and release such a sleazy item, not to mention making a mint doing so.  This might be worth viewing for those interested in seeing the birth of a cinematic trend that would take years to burn out - only to come back again and again just like the unstoppable killers that populated it.  Just remember that Friday the 13th is really nothing special, just a little exploitation flick that got very lucky.  Recommended to the curious.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the best movies I've seen recently"></head><body><p>I sort of thought they didn't make movies as good as this anymore. In a way, Collateral is nostalgic, recalling a time when character development meant more than giving a character a wife with a minor speaking part. In a way, though, too, it's the best kind of modern, with terrific setpieces, editing and action.<br /><br />Slightly eccentric casting pays off in the case of Cruise and Fox, one easily believable as a suave killer who could pass for a businessman, the other equally believable as an ordinary guy with an acute sense of humor. In the end, I think it's not just that they pull off these performances in spite of themselves; but that Cruise's arrogance helps him to channel Vincent, and that Fox brings out the cab driver's sense of humor as one of his defining characteristics.<br /><br />The strong performances by the two main characters and the solid, clever script are the main attractions, but also worth noticing is the beautiful photography; it works so well with its urban location, which always seems like more than a backdrop. Then there's a scene in a dance club called Fever which rivals the House of Blue Leaves sequence in Kill Bill for sheer choreography and slickness. There's something about seeing Tom Cruise effortlessly break a man's leg with a stomp kick which alone is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />Thematically, Collateral is interesting, although Cruise's Philosophical Villain may seem overplayed to those very familiar with such devices. Still, the idea of a doubled character (central to Alfred Hitchcock's work), of moral ambiguity and of a Stockholm Syndrome-like sympathy with Cruise's character, all come off very well. Even at the end, when it seems to degenerate into a simple action picture, the themes are still subtly operating, and are strongest in the last scene.<br /><br />I'm wondering if this film is destined to become a sleeper hit. Even though critics and audiences seem to love it, it was released with little fanfare in a slow season for movies, and didn't do exceptionally well in the box offices. I would say, though, that it rivals any film like it put out in this decade, and deserves to become a classic in the line of Chinatown and A Touch of Evil.</p></body></html>

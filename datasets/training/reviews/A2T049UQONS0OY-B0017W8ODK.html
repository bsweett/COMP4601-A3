I can never understand what the Motion Picture and Film Academy sees when they nominate dull and slow films like this for awards, especially when they nominate them for the biggest award there is. I know its members are easily influenced by hype -- Hollywood lives on hype, after all -- but I see movies better than this one almost every time I turn on the TV.<br /><br />Some of my friends thought otherwise, thinking the romantic storyline, clever ending -- where the heroine apparently atones for an earlier indiscretion -- or the hybrid real-fake scene of early World War II Dunkirk made the movie worth watching. I wish any of this had been true, that this film had mimicked any of the glorious storytelling from "The English Patient", a similarly-induced World War II-era romance.<br /><br />But, alas, this movie did not achieve that. In my opinion, "Atonement" needs to atone to its viewers for boring them to death. This is the slowest film I've seen in some months with just about nothing going on to keep the viewer engaged. Even its raison d'etre -- a scene early on where a young woman misidentifies an event and turns it into sexual misconduct -- is not very fetching. A few directorial and production highlights can't save this somnambulist's delight.<br /><br />So, to summarize, I'd say don't believe the hype about this movie. It is not Academy Award quality and, frankly, isn't very good. I watched "Knocked Up" the night after this and rediscovered the elements that make a film worthwhile and enduring -- humor, human attachment, a clever script, real life characterizations and a complete lack of pretense. I'd say rent "Knocked Up" and forget "Atonement".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="If you like implausible paranoid fantasies, this might be for you.  It wasn't for me."></head><body><p>Well, if you like your villain as some sort of Wizard of Oz - Big Brother Stalinist Nazi - Ranting Phoole with a ham handed George W. Bush smear and your hero as a self-justified terrorist who believes that destroying symbolic infrastructure will somehow revive a moribund culture and that swords are more effective than guns, well, this movie might be for you.<br /><br />I watched the movie because I am a fan of Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving (and I didn't think it was possible that the brothers who made the first Matrix could make a worse movie than Matrix 3, but I was wrong).  Portman and Weaving both do the best they can with the handicaps they are given (such as an idiotic plot and pretty weak dialogue), but ultimately their talents are wasted.<br /><br />John Hurt is a terrific actor who is given the role of the big villain.  The movie completely misunderstands how terror leaders hold power.  It thinks that they yell and scream and threaten and kill everyone indiscriminately.  Really, they have to combine murder with a kind of charisma and off-balancing kindness to keep at least some key people on their side.  Anyway, Hurt is certainly what the script asks him to be, but the character is a waste of his abilities.<br /><br />Weaving only gets to use his voice and I am not sure he was ever the body wearing the mask.  If he was, why?  He is not needed under the mask anymore than James Earl Jones had to wear the Darth Vader costume to create such a memorable character.  There is one scene that is certainly was him, but that is beside the point.  He does a fine job making the character with his voice, but the character of V, from what the movie reveals as his origins, is beyond implausible.<br /><br />The best role in the movie probably goes to Stephen Rea as Inspector Finch (he was also very good as the lead in Citizen X as the detective Lt. Bukarov).  He has that dogged presence that just keeps after the truth no matter where it leads and despite all impediments put in his way.  However, here it is not possible that someone as intelligent as Finch would be so clueless about the truth behind the regime.<br /><br />The Wachowski brothers have traded on a cheap kind of paranoia that resonates with their audience, but this one is incredibly dumb.  If you actually believe that political leaders can make reality out of media messages despite what is actually happening in the real world, well, this movie will seem like a documentary, I guess.  But I would then feel sorry for you and encourage you to get some help.  Each movie these brothers have made since the first Matrix has gotten weaker and more pathetic.  Maybe it is time to turn off their money spigot.  Of course that won't happen because they turned $50 million into $130 million at the box office plus all the DVD sales and rentals to people like me.<br /><br />Oh, well.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Film - more like 4 1/2 stars!"></head><body><p>Needless to say that Edward Norton's performance is as usually, truly exceptional as is also Paul Giamatti's performance first-class. Rufus Sewell's role is a little handicapped, so he doesn't shine as much as he did in his other roles.<br /><br />The film itself is very well made, ... the suspense keeps on tightening throughout the movie, and the ending is a surprise. The director captured the mood of turn-of-the century Vienna very well, although this flick was filmed in Prague and other parts of the Czech Republic. Also, the illusions that Eisenheim (Norton) performs are very believable - it's just fun to watch ... Eisenheim reminds us of a type of Criss Angel during that era.<br /><br />Overall, this film centers around a forbidden love, ... yes, it's a love story with familiar twists plus the added bonus of the magic because of the illusionist's profession. Sure, there are a few scenes that are extended and that could have been shortened, but overall it's well worth watching this film. Again, the acting is superb, the mood and era are very well captured and the photography, script, suspense, etc. deliver a true classic Hollywood experience.</p></body></html>

Most view this film as one of a dysfunctional marriage set in the monotone that was the 1950s.  On the other hand, if the film had been set in the 1960s, it would have been viewed as a dysfunctional couple in which one [April] was determined to abandon the 'straight' life whereas her husband [Frank], simply couldn't, with the tragedy that ensues.<br /><br />As a person who was always uncomfortable with socalled societal conventions, I see it otherwise.  April is determined to shake things up but her 'shake up' has no real direction.  She wants to relocate to Paris without really knowing anything about it....  As third party viewers, we recognize that Paris will prove even more disappointing than Connecticut.  Her husband, Frank, who has been to Paris, is initially carried away by his wife's dream but, learning of her pregnancy, he is jerked back into reality.  Not April.<br /><br />April, who was probably always psychiatrically fragile, slides inexorably into mental illness.  Severe mental illness is tragic as is demonstrated graphically in the grim ending of this well-acted tale.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite author of novels...'Skull Rack' and 'Hummingbird God'...on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico</p></body></html>

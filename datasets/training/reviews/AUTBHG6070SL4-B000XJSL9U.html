We've see John McClane (Willis) before, so we know we can count on him for a testosterone-fueled rampage against the master terrorist. Then there's the master terrorist, with the requisite delusions of grandeur, threating all of Americas and John's personal life, as usual. There's a daughter to save, a nerd to protect, and - well, nothing really new here.<br /><br />So let's just get to the good stuff. The chases are great, which helps because most of the movie seems to be chases. Lots of stuff blows up and burns. Lots of cars go flying through the air, landing in ways sure to void the warrantee. There are lots of great fights, and some pretty spectacular set-pieces - that car in the elevator shaft comes to mind. And, when you want a really manly way to shoot the bad guy, wait for the end and see how McClane does it.<br /><br />It's a guy flick, with all the macho, witty quips, and damage to persons and property you could hope for. No grand themes or sensitive moments, but why would a real man want that kind of stuff anyway?<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release</p></body></html>

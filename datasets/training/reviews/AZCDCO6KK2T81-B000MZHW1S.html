<meta name="summary" content="Diamond Delivers!!!"></head><body><p>This is an impressive and captivating movie experience.  It is a bit overly long, but it is entralling entertainment.  DiCaprio is totally believable in his role as jaded South African diamond smuggler Danny Archer who discovers that his heart still has some moral compass in it afterall as he assists both a journalist named Maddy, convincingly played by Jennifer Connelly of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FVQLQQ">A Beautiful Mind</a>, who is trying to cover the corrupt diamond industries use of "conflict diamonds" which cause civil wars, poverty, unimaginable brutality, and slave labor within the countries where they are mined, and a simple fisherman named Soloman, wonderfully portrayed by the ever reliable Djimon Hounsou (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783231202">Amistad</a>), who only wants to reunite with his family who have been reduced to either living in a refugee camp in a neighboring country or as slave labor/child warrior by various factions in the country's civil war.<br /><br />The themes of greed, family loyalty, love for country, poverty and war are handled well-enough if not a bit over-the-top at times.  However, the theme of redemption is handled with great care.  It's not heavy-handed and/or sentimental.  In fact, DiCaprio's character struggles with this consistently in the film as either pretends he doesn't need any kind of redemption or once he does he often takes the wrong path to redemption by using the diamond for his own means while acting as if he's doing it for others' sake.  He often looks at his actions as hitting three birds with one stone in that he gets his money from the diamond, Soloman gets his family, and Maddy gets her story; however, he later learns that that is not so simple and someone is going to lose out in this deal and lose big time.  Danny Archer is the kind of role I think would have attracted Bogart or Kirk Douglass during their acting days as they often played roles whose morals were rather ambiguous at times.<br /><br />Although a bit overly long and heavy handed in some thematic areas, this film is very engrossing, well-paced with action sequences, and extraordinarily well-acted.  Oscar nominations were abound for this small masterpiece of a film.  DiCaprio has rarely been better and although this came out the same year as his much praised performance in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M5AJQS">The Departed</a>, I think he was far better in this film.</p></body></html>

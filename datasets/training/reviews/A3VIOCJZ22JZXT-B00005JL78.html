This is a great film with a complicated plot that twists and turns for 2.5 hours.<br /><br />The acting is superb. Tom Cruise and Max Von Sydow deliver the expected high level professional preformance. If you doubt Cruise's acting ability, look at the scene in which he searchers a crowded public pool for his missing son, frantically calling his son's name. Or watch the scene where the precog, Agatha, reveals the story of the life his missing son could have lived (and then in a great plot twist - we find out she is seeing not the life of the missing son but the life of the yet to be born son). Watch Cruise hang on her every word despite the pain he feels. Colin Farrel does a really good job of showing us a multi-layered personality. He first comes off as a smart-aleck Justice Department attorney conducting an investigation on a pilot program nearing completion. Then he reveals he is a former cop and we see him become more brawny as he fights Cruise in an automobile factory. The viewer is pulled for loyalty between the fugitive Cruise, whom we think is innocent, and the ambitious newcomer Agent Witwer who reveals to us scene by scene a man of competence and justice seeking truth. It is when the viewer fully realizes that Agent Witwer is actually an upright guy, that he is most in danger of falling victim to the dark forces of Washington policy masters.Samatha Morton does a great job of playing Agatha, gradually coming out of her coma and revealing past, present, future to an endangered man who may help reveal the crime and criminal behind her mother's death.<br /><br />Never underestimate Phillip K. Dick. In "Bladerunner" he was able to construct a great science fiction story around existentialism. In "Minority Report" he resurrects the ancient Oracles of Delphi and builds an action packed story around Free Will and Determinism. It is a strength of this film that at multiple points, the characters are faced with a decision that appears to be foretold but which is still in play. Agatha, the precog, whispers "you can choose" at the most critical of these points and the film firmly supports that we as humans can exert our free will but within a deterministic context.  Cruise selects not to kill Leo Crow, the criminal who supposedly kidnapped and killed his son, even though all the precognitions reveal an image in which it appears that he does kill Leo. This is the point in which he exerts his free will, his freedom to chose his course of action, and yet we also see how a structured deterministic world still confines that choice. However once the choice is made, a new future of causative links unfolds and the consequences for freedom take their path.  Phillip K. Dick creates a world for us here in which we see that freedom of choice and pre-ordained determinism co-exist and that the consciousness of a good man makes all the difference.<br /><br />Two final comments on the technology of the future: first, the film rightly shows that customer consumer patterns will become so tailored that marketers will be  able to show you exactly what you are looking for before you aware you are looking. Also, the criminal files contained in the precognitive visions were fascinating as both Cruise and Farrell pulled them across the screen for analysis. But, they were essentially images pulled across the desktop of the future, much like we pull documents from a file as we sit at our desks today.<br /><br />Good acting, witty and suspenseful, intelligent and complicated plot, philosophical underpinning, and fantastic art direction and special effects all come together to make Minority Report an excellent film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Graceful Maria"></head><body><p>Plot descriptions have been given, so I'll focus on my thoughts regarding the film.<br /><br />This film was a touching and emotional story, believable and sad. Why sad? Sad because Maria was expected to support her daughter's child and her mother, sad because her boss was a jerk, and sad because the only job for her in the vicinity was the flower factory. Where else would she find work to do everything she needed to do?<br /><br />Particularly harrowing - and deftly handled - were the scenes dealing with the ingestion of the drug packets. I tried to imagine doing it myself, and had a difficult time, knowing that one mistake could kill me. These girls must have been truly desperate to become mules. I can't possibly imagine their destitution.<br /><br />Part of me wanted to see more of the dirty side of the drug business. It seemed too clean. The dealers in Columbia, although they did make slightly veiled threats, came off as nice and amiable. Perhaps they are - I have no clue. The receivers in the U.S. seemed to be more of the real thing, given their callous reactions to the three girls, and what they did to Lucy, of course. What was very unbelievable, however, was that they actually gave the girls their money when the girls ran away with the drugs. They had no obligation to do so, they could have kept the money for themselves, nobody would have given them a hard time, so why'd they do it? For that matter, why did the girls run off with the drugs in the first place? I understand that when a person is confronted with a horrific scene, as Maria and Blanca were when they saw what happened to Lucy that all logic can fly out the window, but surely there had to be some understanding that if they fled with the drugs (and why would they do that anyway?) they would be endangering not only themselves, but their families back in Columbia. After all, there were the veiled (but undoubtedly fully understood) threats.<br /><br />Also, although was labeled as being rebellious by her boss and by her family - their perceptions, and absolutely incorrect - I saw her as a very kind and decent person. I thought that her acquiescence to becoming a mule was too quick. I wish that Maria<br /><br />That's my only complaint. Otherwise, it was touched and moved me greatly.</p></body></html>

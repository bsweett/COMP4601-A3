<meta name="summary" content="Truth or Consequences"></head><body><p>Child prodigy, Briony (Saoirse Ronan), is very capable.  Using a typewriter in her family's stately English house, she is able to produce "stupendous" plays--as her mother says--while barely a teenager.<br /><br />Her great work, however, is based on an actual experience.  Seeing her sister Cecilia (Keira Knightly) from her window, she sees her undress in front of her suitor, Robbie (James McAvoy) in front of a fountain.  Astonished, she looks away from the window.  When she looks back up, Cecilia is drenched, having gone in the fountain.  The whole scene seems mischievous, filled with passion.  Shortly later, we see that scene played out again.  But this time we see it properly from the couple's point-of-view.  Robbie has become playful and careless.  He eventually knocks a vase out of Cecilia's hand which breaks on the stone rim of the fountain with a piece going into the water well.  Aware of its value as the family's most valuable keepsake, Cecilia strips of her clothing and dives into the fountain to retrieve the missing piece.<br /><br />One of the main elements of 'Atonement' is deception.  What a child sees can be misleading.  As I watched the film, I kept thinking of 'Witness' and how in real life people can take matters out of context.  One's view of an event can look very different from another`s.  Much like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LXH0AE">Stranger Than Fiction</a> before it, the movie blends, then sorts out fiction from reality.<br /><br />Richly embellished in music that highlights the mood of every scene, and edited with such keen perfection as to be Oscar worthy,  ('No Country for Old Men' being the other big contender in my mind.') 'Atonement' has a standard of excellence that seldom falters for a moment.  The frenetic pace of the music, matched with the tapping of the typewriter, build up to some intangible suspense.  Where the story is going, no one has a clue.  Like many recent cinematic offerings, the movie starts to shuffle the time frames.  Mainly it goes forward, but sometimes it backs up to show us a new piece of evidence.  Although different in impact, the life changing incidents reminded me of the shuffling done in the recent film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00112S8S2">Before the Devil Knows You're Dead [Blu-ray</a>].<br /><br />From there Robbie's and Cecilia's lives are disrupted.  Starting in 1935, the couple must later face the debacle of the Second Great War.  What is so special about `Atonement' is the way it plays out the contrast between the fate that we all must face (in this case war), and the consequential choices that make or mar people's lives.  While the ending isn't entirely neat and tidy, the resolution has a sweeping resonance that hardly teases the audience.<br /><br />Besides yeoman craftsmanship by director,  Joe Wright, and editor, Paul Tothill, 'Atonement' brings upper echelon performances to the screen.  Christopher Hampton's screenplay adaptation (from a novel by Ian McEwan) is solid and  keeps the emotional tension.  'Atonement' may not be as strong as last year's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NIVJFY">Notes on a Scandal</a>, but it is a compelling piece of work, nevertheless.  With all of its assets, this film may indeed bring a day of reckoning when it gets closer to the annual awards.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Elvis and JFK 'Take On' the Mummy!"></head><body><p>BUBBA HO-TEP (love that name!) may be one of the wackier forays into horror you'll find (Elvis Presley and JFK take on the Mummy...I'm NOT kidding!), but it actually works, thanks to Don Coscarelli's assured direction, and the likable performances of the two leads, Bruce Campbell and Ossie Davis.<p>A kind of modern tall tale, set in a run-down nursing home in the bleak Texas desert, the story involves an aged Elvis (or his greatest impersonator), barely able to walk, and with a disgusting canker sore on his privates, drifting in and out of a drugged haze. Played by a dead-on Campbell (who sounds so much like the King that I thought, momentarily, that he was dubbed), he spends his few moments of lucidity ruminating on losing Priscilla, not 'being there' for his daughter, and the failures of his life.<p>His only 'friend' in the home is an aged black man, claiming to be John Fitzgerald Kennedy, much of his brain &quot;replaced by sand&quot;, and his skin dyed black by LBJ and the other conspirators who 'faked' his assassination. Legendary actor/playwright Davis gives the role a quiet dignity, not attempting to mimic the President, and his authority, even in his most outrageous statements, makes the elderly character seem totally sincere.<p>As fellow patients begin to die off, and a weird, ugly beetle-like scarab attacks Elvis, JFK pieces together a theory; that an Egyptian mummy has somehow been unleashed, who is sucking the souls of the helpless victims out of their rectums (as I said, the man is given to some wild theories). As it turns out, there IS a mummy prowling about, and this being Texas, he is complete with a cowboy hat and boots! Knowing that no sane person would believe them, the pair, revitalized by purpose, arm themselves with available 'weapons', and 'take on' the soul-sucker by themselves...<p>While the script has some hilarious one-liners and physical humor, the film is actually played fairly straight, as Coscarelli understands that the protagonists would generate far more audience sympathy if presented as 'real' people, and not caricatures. As crazy as the heroes are, you'll be hard-pressed NOT to root for them at the film's climax!<p>BUBBA HO-TEP has all the makings of a future cult classic, and if you're in the mood for something COMPLETELY different, don't miss it!</p></body></html>

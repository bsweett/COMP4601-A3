<meta name="summary" content="Good drama/thriller"></head><body><p>This is a movie that you must pay close attention to at all times or you may get lost in the twists and turns. It's a good thriller with a complicated plot and worth the rewinds if you do have to watch again to digest everything between and during the flashbacks. Matt Damon takes on a secretive career within the CIA where people can easily 'disappear' and are often distanced from their family. When one of his operations endangers his only son, Edward Wilson (Damon) must suddenly make tough choices regarding loyalties.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

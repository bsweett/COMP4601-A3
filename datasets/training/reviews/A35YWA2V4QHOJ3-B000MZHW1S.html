All these African countries are in constant states of war, civil war, military coups & general unrest.  Darfur gets a lot of publicity, but it is hardly the only place in Africa that is in crisis.  Genocide is pretty much the norm for most countries, and a perpetual state of chaos is commonplace.  Only place in Africa I'd like to visit someday would be Egypt to see the Pyramids.  However, that won't be anytime soon w/all this terrorist nonsense.<br /><br />  The cast of BD was excellent.  I've always had a crush on Jennifer Connelly.  She has gone from being a young pretty face to being a very accomplished actress (and she's still a pretty face!).  Djimon Hounsou has a very powerful screen presence (and not just because he is buffed up!).  As was the case in GLADIATOR and AMISTAD, he is able to convey a lot of emotion through very few words.<br /><br />Thankfully, for myself, I've never been into diamonds.  Never have bought one, and very much doubt I ever will.  For people who have indulged in diamonds, this film might be a shocking (and not so pleasant) eye-opener of where your diamonds actually come from.  In any case, it is truly a poignant film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing "Road""></head><body><p>Just recently saw this on Blu-Ray, and unfortunately despite the casting of Winslet and DiCaprio, the film was a respectable failure.  I say "respectable" because despite Mendes' direction and the attention to the '50s setting, I felt a sense of "deja vu" to this film that I didn't have to "American Beauty".  If it weren't for Michael Shannon excellent rendering of a dysfunctional character, I would probably knock this down 2 stars but in fact his appearance gives this film the needed spark to rescue it from pure tedium.  I'm sure the book was very poetic but unfortunately it did not translate to film so well.  If you really want to see Winslet at her best, check out "The Reader".</p></body></html>

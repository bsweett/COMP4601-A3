<meta name="summary" content="Decent action film"></head><body><p>I found The Punisher to be a fairly entertaining action movie.  If I can recall correctly John Travolta is only in it at the end of it.  Maybe a little in the front as well, but mainly towards the back end of the film.  There is a lot of action and suspense that keeps you watching it.  I don't know that the script is very original since it seems too many movies are being made with the exact same story, hunting down people for revenge.  Guess that type of topic is good for movie making since it can bring a lot of interest to the viewer.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller</p></body></html>

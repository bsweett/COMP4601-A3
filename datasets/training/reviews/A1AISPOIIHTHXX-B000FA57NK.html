<meta name="summary" content="Predictable but still thrilling"></head><body><p>It's a question that probably enters a lot of director's minds when they film a movie based on a true story: how do you make it exciting and interesting even when we know the results of the real event? Yes the astronauts do survive, although one died several years later but still the movie manages to be thrilling.<br /><br />Late 1960's, everyone was in awe as NASA astronaut Neil Armstrong walked on the moon, blowing people's minds that we could do that and also satisfied that America was there first before Russia. However, that awe is starting to wane so when the Apollo 13 mission is announced, it's almost not even worth a mention.<br /><br />Early 70's, Apollo 13 takes off and everything's fine until an explosion cripples the shuttle seriously and the crew have to fight to stay alive while the ground crew fight to figure out a way to bring them home with very little power. Helping out the ground crew is Ken Mattingly, the former pilot who was ousted for Jack Swigert days before launch for medical reasons.<br /><br />One of my favorite scenes in the film and probably a good indicator of what the film can do, is when the crew fires it's engines in hopes to pick up some speed and return home quicker. They take a simple idea of keeping the Earth in a window and make it quite exciting. And it's what the film does best: it takes the simplest things or the most well-known event and makes it suspenseful, almost making you forget they'll be fine.<br /><br />The human drama scenes are nicely played but it's the suspense scenes and the neat-as-hell space shots of the shuttle that look the most impressive but still the film is a good watch.</p></body></html>

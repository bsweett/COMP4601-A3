<meta name="summary" content="COLD RECEPTION FOR A HOT WILDER CLASSIC"></head><body><p>MGM continues to insult the intelligence of the DVD consumer with this 'special edition' of one of Billy Wilder's all time great romantic comedies.  Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are witnesses to the Valentine's Day Massacre.  To stay alive the boys shave their legs, dress in drag and join an all-girl's band fronted by sulty singing sensation, Sugar Cane (Marilyn Monroe).  Featuring Monroe's inimitable renditions of &quot;Running Wild&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Be Loved By You&quot; this is a keeper in every respect.<br />Unfortunately MGM Home Entertainment has done a terrible job of remastering the print.  Though the black and white picture exhibits exceptional contrast and clarity, the obtrusive inclusion of edge enhancement, artifacting, aliasing, fine detail shimmering and digital grit make for a really unattractive visual presentation.  The sound has been remixed to 5.1, but the dated fidelity shines through.  Still, the audio is presented at an acceptable listening level and without much distortion or echo.<br />Extras included a trip down memory lane with Tony Curtis that is overly long and really dragged down by Curtis' flamboyant hamming it up for the cameras.  Oh well, I can't imagine too many people are asking him to shave his legs these days.  Bottom line: If you absolutely must have the film I guess you could waste your money on this version.  My hope is that someone at MGM will want to revisit this classic at a later date and with a more reputable transfer.  Here's to hoping.  Besides - nobody's perfect!</p></body></html>

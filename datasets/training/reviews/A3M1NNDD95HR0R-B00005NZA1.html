<meta name="summary" content="A Movie With A Quiet Intensity"></head><body><p>Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson star in this movie, and M. Night Shyamalan is the director and filmaker.  I love Shyamalan's work, and also recommend The Sixth Sense, which he also wrote.  This movie may not be better than The Sixth Sense, but it is better than The Village and Signs (also by Shyamalan).  It quietly advances leaving you wondering where the impact is going to be, then you see it and it is significant, interesting, and sometimes intense.  If you watch with a careful eye, you will get the most out of this film.  Be patient; you are in for a whammy of an ending.</p></body></html>

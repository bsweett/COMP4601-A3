<meta name="summary" content="The Twist and Turn"></head><body><p>This is really a beautifully shot film.  It is one of my favorites of the past year.  That being said, it is not perfect.  This does have an excellent cast, and a really interesting setting in turn of the century London.  I really liked the story, though the ending seemed almost too comic book for me.  It was a suprise though.  I expected a twist(and there are a few), but I did not guess this one.  The acting is top notch.  The only problem is the emotional investment wasn't fully there.  Each magacian is very flawed, and I did not know who to feel sorry for, or who to hate.  I guess that is the beauty of good actors playing very real characters.  Overall this is a terrific film, and I would recommend it.</p></body></html>

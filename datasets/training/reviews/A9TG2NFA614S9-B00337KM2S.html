<meta name="summary" content="Firing People Is a Skill"></head><body><p>In "Up in the Air" George Clooney starts off as a cold-blooded, self-absorbed man whose job is telling people that their companies are firing them (laying them off). His business is thriving because we are, of course, in the middle of a recession, His job requires him to travel incessantly and rack up millions of frequent flyer air miles. His goal in life, perhaps his only goal, is to prove how self-sufficient he is and reach ten million miles. He's good at his job at giving people the ax and uses psychology to make them accept it. He's full of slogans and bromides for himself and others.<br /> The ghoulish company he works for has a lot of people on the road flying everywhere to tell people that they've been made redundant; that their jobs have been terminated. As far as the poor people are concerned, they as human beings have been terminated. In many brief scenes we see these people reacting sometimes profanely to Clooney's news. He also, in his spare time, gives inspirational talks on how people have to be sharks and worry only about themselves and their needs, not to weigh themselves down, the philosophy of selfishness.<br /> Along comes a young woman who talks Clooney's boss into taking all the bad news purveyors off the road to save money by having the hapless terminated people be informed by tele-conferences. Clooney says the idea stinks because the people need to confront a real person.<br /> He takes this young woman out on the road to show her what the human dimensions of the job are. She has to first learn to pack economically and not have any checked luggage. Out on the road, as she gives the bad news, one woman even threatens suicide. It's hell out there, she finds out.<br /> The movie presents Clooney like a twenty-first century gladiator, packing his roll-on carry on bag which effortlessly fits into the overhead compartment. It shows how efficiently he goes through security, how he goes to the airport frequent flyer lounges, how often travel workers greet him by name. He loves being the seasoned, honored frequent traveler. He's a pro at what he does, spending 322 days on the road. But isn't he in reality a loser, lacking a co-pilot, nothing but a parenthesis?</p></body></html>

You've got great actors and some interesting and innovative technology.  P.S. Hoffman makes a top-shelf bad guy, right up there with my all-time favorite, Dirty Harry's Andy Robinson.  The plot moves right along and a somewhat schmaltzy but satisfying ending is provided.  In that sense, MI:3 lives up to its predecessors and is good entertainment.<br /><br />But, I can't ignore the problems with this movie, some minor, some major:<br /><br />*  Minor problem.  Are writers too lazy to do any good foreshadowing anymore?  What is going on with this faux-noir business of showing us the climatic scene at the beginning of the movie?  I noticed this in Turistas as well.  I'm no fan of European cinema, but take a look at the foreshadowing done in Sexy Beast: a boulder hurtling at you and almost killing you but landing instead in your swimming pool.  Now *that's* some witty, well-done foreshadowing!  Giving away part of the plot SPOILER ALERT (Davian's escape and Julia's kidnapping) for a cheap head fake just doesn't cut it.<br /><br />*  Minor problem.  We need more originality in action scenes.<br /><br />>  The "let's launch a missile strike on a long bridge" scene was done in True Lies.  Granted, one was filmed on US1 and the other was filmed on the Chesapeake Bay Bridge, but is there really that much difference between the two?  I'm also a little perplexed as to why Ethan's posse would transport prisoners across the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in the first place, since there are plenty of perfectly good airports right in D.C., military and civilian.  For anyone who knows the area, they're bound to be put off by this obvious plot hole.  There were continuity problems in this scene as well, with the helicopter hovering above the bridge superstructure in some shots but not in others.  A nine-figure budget should eliminate those kinds of mistakes.<br /><br />>  The Shanghai building jump scene was done in Tomb Raider 3.  It's even a rip-off to a certain extent of both Die Hard and even Green Ice, for crying out loud.<br /><br />>  The "attack the guy while immobilized by biting him" scene was done in The Bone Collector.  Stabbing to death with a pen?  Silence of the Lambs and Gross Pointe Blank.<br /><br />>  The "kill him then revive him" scene was done in The Abyss.<br /><br />*  Minor problem.  Typical left-wing politics and Hollywood trash-talking.  Agent Musgrave's against affirmative action.  Ooooh.  He *must* be evil.  C.f. Derek's father in American History X.<br /><br />*  Major problem.  The actual theft of the Rabbit's Foot - what's up with that?  We're just supposed to assume Ethan broke through to the right floor, evaded guards, found the device's location, busted it out of whatever super-protected contraption it was in, and made his way out?  That's inattentive, lame and just plain lousy writing.  This sort of "we won't tell you how he did it but trust us, he does" attitude ruined The Hitcher, Identity and even to a certain extent Die Hard 2.<br /><br />*  Major problem.  Once again we get the "rogue CIA chief is out to kill you"** theme.  We just had that, again, with the Bourne series.  Isn't there something else we could use for bad guys other than institutions dedicated to protecting us?  Something like, oh, I don't know, terrorists who are part of a global fascist ideology fueled by the teaching of a seventh-century prophet?  Or are we just playing it safe by once again beating up on U.S. intelligence institutions?  Or is it just to increase the overseas gross?  You tell me.<br /><br />*  Major problem.  "Halliburton made me do it."  A whole movie was actually made - remade - on this theme, The Manchurian Candidate.  In the somewhat-coherent "I'll tell you why I did it" scene, Musgrave justifies his betrayal by appearing to say that the Rabbit's Foot will be used to frame some poor little Mohammedan country, which will be bombed, then rebuilt, presumably by Halliburton under a "no bid" contract.<br /><br />Adding it up you've got great acting, the best F/X money can buy, and great gadgets on the one hand, and tired plot, reworked action scenes and careless, clich&eacute;d writing on the other.  The producers of the MI series should take a lesson from the 1988 version of D.O.A., where a character tells the protagonist that of the protagonist's four books, there's the "third that's a little careless and a fourth that sort of stinks!"  Let's leave the MI series at "a little careless," so we won't have to get to the one that sort of stinks.<br /><br />**  IMF, CIA, whatever.</p></body></html>

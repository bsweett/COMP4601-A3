<meta name="summary" content=""SIDEWAYS" only appealing to the ... Intelligent! :) :)"></head><body><p>This film is one of those movies that are made for people that can understand the deeper meaning of certian subjects & Content, the movie is some what similar to "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zizzou" and "Lost in Translation", Paul Giamatti to me is a alot like Bill Murray other than the fact the Mr. Murray has a bit more of a humorous side, Giamatti in my opinion is one of the most under-rated actors of this decade. His performance in "Cinnderella Man" was oscar worthy as was his remarkable performance the the low-budget film, American Splender. I cannot wait to see the new M. Night Shaymalon film in which he plays the lead role, I believe it is called "Lady In The Water".BUT back to the subject at hand, Sideways follows to very different people, Jack and Miles (played by Thomas Haden Church & Giamatti) and how they spend a week vacation in the wine country of California. Though Jack is planning on getting married when he returns from their trip he hooks up with a young woman who Jack says is quote "Nasty, Nasty, Nasty! Miles!, do you have that condom I gave you?" ( I think you get the picture...), The movie & Jack continuously point out Miles's low self-esteem, bland and depressing attitude toward life & but of corse his major problems with da ladies!, though the movie can make you somewhat depressed for poor Miles it also has a tendencey to throw you off a bit for a good laugh or two.<br /><br />The cinamatography is absolutly stunning, the humor is uncanny, the acting is flawless and the dialouge, direction & screenplay are all exceptional, though the movie can be slow to some with small attention spands and others who have to have either non-stop action or constant humor, I thought it was very good and would recommend it to most. Great Film!<br /><br />Grade: A-</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Day After Tomorrow- Silly, Good-Natured Fun"></head><body><p>The Day After Tomorrow is a film you see for a dazzling array of visual effects.  Directed by Roland Emmerich who made one of the biggest hits of 1996, Independence Day and one of the biggest disappoinments of 1998, Godzilla.  He also made the enjoyable The Patriot in 2000.  You don't see this type of movie for a story since it's so cliche, and not too mention a tad unbelievable.<br />  The story uses the lame father-son tale, pretty much Dennis Quaid goes to try and rescue his son who is trapped in flooded New York City.  SPOILER: And of the course the film has a happy ending, considering none of the major characters die.  Are you buying the realism?  Didn't think so.  The disaster sequences are nothing short of remarkable, this film had a $125 million budget and it definitely shows.  The disaster sequences while great could've been longer, they seemed to have gone by pretty quickly but this film goes by pretty fast considering it's 123 minutes.  Jake Gyllenhaul, Dennis Quaid, Emmy Rossum, and Ian Holm give fine performances.  Wow, weren't expecting good acting in a film like this huh?<br />  The Day After Tomorrow is rated PG-13 for Intense Situations of Peril.  The disaster sequences look incredibly realistic and believable and could scare some people.  The images of the tornadoes destroying Los Angeles and the flooding of New York are intense.  There's also a fake-looking, completely CG, wolf attack sequence which is used as a mindless digression.  Though this film could upset some considering it targets the Bush administration in a negative way, Vice President Cheney is portrayed as arrogant and rude, which I must say did upset me.  Overall this is an enjoyable film and worth seeing in theatres, just don't take it seriously in terms of the plot.  If you don't catch at the theatres, definitely check it out when it hits the shelves of Blockbuster.</p></body></html>

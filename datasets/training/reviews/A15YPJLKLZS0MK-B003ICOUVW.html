<meta name="summary" content="Hip Update"></head><body><p>This is a hip update of the classic Universal film  The Wolf Man. It was one of the only Universal horrors I hadn't seen. I saw only bits and pieces of it. This updated version is actually made by Universal studios. It was not scary, but worth seeing once. It said made by Joe Johnson in the end credits.</p></body></html>

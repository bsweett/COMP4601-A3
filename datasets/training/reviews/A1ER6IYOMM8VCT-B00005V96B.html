<meta name="summary" content="FOR MONSTERS ONLY! A CLASSIC MONSTER STORY!"></head><body><p>I love animated films and Monster Inc. is no exception. It's got great animation, characters and a well thought out story, but it might be a little too intense for the youngest viewers. Classic monster buffs will catch lots of winks and nods to the days of yesteryear in this irresistible and funny film. It might do your young children good to see this with an adult to help them get over 'the monsters in the closet' syndrome most kids have at a young age. The two disc set has a beautiful DVD transfer and lots of extras.</p></body></html>

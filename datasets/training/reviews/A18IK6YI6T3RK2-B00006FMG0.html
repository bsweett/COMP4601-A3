It is a perfect period film and Hanks and Newman have never been better.  The story is riviting, it holds your attention from start to finish.  Director Mendes really hits his stride here, and the young actor playing Hanks son is quite a talent.  Much of the film is set in the winter and you can feel the chill in the air, the weather is a ominious presence.  The interection between Hanks and Newman is electric, the scene when Hanks is at the piano and Newman comes over is one of the best acting I have ever seen on film.  It is interesting to hear Mendes take on this scene and that is one of the great features on this DVD.  If you appreciate great movies, then you will thoroughly enjoy this film, a true work of art..well done Mr. Mendes.</p></body></html>

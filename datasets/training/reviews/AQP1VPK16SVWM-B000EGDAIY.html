How else to describe the lovely home this evil spirit occupies in "The Grudge"? Sarah Michelle Gellar stars as Karen Davis a nurse living in Japan who provides care for those who require assisted living. This spooky ghost story scared up a hefty profit when it opened. It appears that grudges pay off for director Takashi Shimizu as this is his third or fourth remake of the same film. Luckily, the American remake refines the scares that made the Japanese theatrical hit such a big draw both overseas and even in the US. Keep in mind this is a suspenseful ghost story not a gore fest so don't expect a lot of blood and guts because that's not what this is all about (although it does have its moments). Top notch performances from the cast including Bill Pullman and Sarah Michelle Gellar help create a convincing, tense atmospheric thriller. While this has been Americanized for its audience, Takashi Shimizu's direction remains sharp and he refines his film making it a powerful, spooky thriller,<br /><br /> A top notch transfer from Columbia highlights this terrific DVD. The colors are vivid and bright capturing the lovely, ghostly look of the original theatrical release perfectly. The 5.1 mix uses the format extremely well with nice imaging, sound and depth. The ethereal sound mix perfectly matches the tone and texture of the visual images.<br /><br /> We get a five part documentary on the making of the movie. Sam Raimi (Darkman, Spiderman, Spiderman 2, Evil Dead, A Simple Plan, Army of Darkness) discusses his interest in the film and the cast including Bill Pullman and Sarah Michelle Gellar discuss what drew them to this ghost story. All comment on the stylish direction, the inspiration from Japanese folklore and its impact on the story. Screenwriter Susco discusses how he honed the original Japanese story and repackaged it for an American sensibility without losing what made the original so special. Director Shimizu discusses (via subtitles) how he crafted the story for a very different audience. Covering everything from the Myth of the Ju-On (the power of a woman's rage) to the culture shock the American cast faced making the movie.<br /><br />Under the Skin focuses not on what scares us but why we like to be scared. Joseph LeDoux a psychiatric professor and author discusses how viewing other people being threatened gives us the adrenaline rush that the characters feel without the threat of actual danger. Using footage from the film along with footage of LeDoux, this featurette doesn't tell us something we don't already know but confirms why we react the way we do to horror films, urban myths and stories. We also get a humber of previews from forthcoming Columbia releases.<br /><br />As usual Sam Raimi, Ted Raimi, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Robert Tapert, Clea  DuVall, Kadee Strickland, Stephen Susco all combine their talents for an informative, funny (and occasionally annoying) commentary track. They clearly are having such a good time doing the commentary track that even the annoying moments when they indulge themselves a bit too much are fun to listen to at least the first time.<br /><br />An unusual scary ghost story "The Grudge" will keep you on the edge of your seat. Well made, acted and produced the DVD looks exceptionally good. The extras include a comprehensive documentary on the making of the movie and a featurette on why we like fear in movies (and ghost stories). A great job overall by Columbia, the director, cast, screenwriter and producers Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert.</p></body></html>

I finally saw it on DVD recently and was very impressed by it, and consider it one of the best films of 2003.<p>10 characters end up at a Bates-like Motel, with seemingly nothing in common.  When people start dying, it becomes a case of who-dunnit. To tell anymore would give it away, but let me say it is one of the most original twist endings I have seen in a long time.<p>John Cusack is excellent, as is Ray Liota.  Rebecca Mornay makes a comeback in this film, if only for 10 minutes.  You will not recognise her at first with her brunette hair.<p>Ignore the negative reviews, Identity is a clever and imaginative film which blew me away! I had the DVD in my possession for awhile choosing not to watch it because of its poor performance at the box office.  Howeverm, that was my loss, because the film was excellent.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A powerful, compelling film full of stand-out performances"></head><body><p>Despite some deficiencies in the plot, V for Vendetta makes for a fantastic, refreshingly different kind of motion picture.  The controversy surrounding the film was blown out of proportion, but it's easy to see why it could raise hackles in some quarters.  It's really the old terrorist vs. freedom fighter question which has taken on such an important place in modern society.  Despite a jab here or there at the United States, I don't think the film really makes any statement at all along today's geopolitical lines - due in no small part to the story's fantastical setting.  We all know never to say "it can't happen here," but I for one can certainly never foresee a blatantly fascist society with its very own Hitlerian demagogue emerging in, of all places, England.  Clearly, at least to me, the questions this film raises are quite abstract and not directly applicable to current events vis-&agrave;-vis the war on terror.  As an eye-opening reminder of the possibility of governmental abuse of power, however, the film's warning stands us all in good stead.<br /><br />The setting for this film is a futuristic England, wherein a fiery egomaniac and his cronies have usurped power and brought a hard iron fist down on the people.  Freedom of ideas and expression no longer exists; minority groups have been decimated by imprisonment, torture, and death; and militaristic nationalism has become the new religion.  Those who resisted the meteoric rise of the new High Chancellor have been dealt with ruthlessly, producing a population cowed and blind to the evils of their brave new nation-state.  The illusion of peace is broken by one man, however - one man brave enough to speak the truth, rally the masses, and get his message out that the government is beyond corrupt and purely evil.  V wears the mask of the infamous Guy Fawkes, but his message is more than symbolic.  For twenty years, he has worked for this moment in time, intent on meting out justice and vengeance on those who wronged him personally and the body politic as a whole.  His tactics are certainly questionable, but his motivations are unimpeachable.<br /><br />It's all too easy to get bogged down in the question as to V's nature - be it terrorist or freedom fighter.  Unfortunately, the question must be asked and has been asked by some who condemn the film for glorifying terrorism.  To my eyes, he's clearly a terrorist - and a freedom fighter.  One has to look at the whole picture, though.  Here, we can see that the government V seeks to destroy is unquestionably evil.  Does that make it okay for V to employ tactics of murder and widespread destruction?  That's for each viewer to decide.  It's difficult to judge a man who does the wrong things for the right reasons.  It's even harder to carry that sort of thinking further, but it's healthy for individuals to ponder such questions, especially as humanity has a long tradition of learning nothing from history.<br /><br />Back to the film itself, one must pay tribute to a number of wonderful performances.  Natalie Portman proves once again that she's among the finest actresses in the world (a fact which George Lucas never seemed to acknowledge, since he didn't allow her to actually act in Star Wars Episode III).  The character of Evey was quite a challenge, but Portman makes you doubt that any other actress could have played her.  Nothing says commitment like a beautiful woman allowing her head to be shaved for the benefit of the character.  Hugo Weaving is mysteriously majestic as the man behind the mask, giving unassailable substance to a character who could have easily come across as cartoonish.  Stephen Rea brings a wonderful human counterpart to the story as the Chief Inspector, and John Hurt is brilliantly effective as the evil Chancellor.  The overall cinematography is also spectacularly done, while the special effects are really something to see.  V for Vendetta really is just a few plot holes and inconsistencies away from being a certifiable five-star film.</p></body></html>

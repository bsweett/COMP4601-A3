<meta name="summary" content="This is only a chick flick if you're not man enough to enjoy a good romantic comedy"></head><body><p>I wasn't expecting to enjoy this film, much less laugh or be moved to an occasional tear. Honestly, Jack Black's face on the cover screamed: "Not in a million years!" Seriously, Jack Black, romantic comedy? Seriously, Jack Black - seriously? Well, there are four stars at the top of this review, so did Jack work? No, he didn't. I have a feeling that the filmmakers were aware of this as well because his screen time was ? that of his other co-stars.<br /><br />Yet, this is a four-star review. So what worked?<br /><br />This is a difficult movie to compartmentalize. Per the story line, it should be split equally into two parts. Amanda (Cameron Diaz) is a movie-trailer producer who lives in LA and has broken up with her boyfriend. She's looking for an escape. Iris (Kate Winslet) is in love with someone she works with, yet he has just become engaged, much to her unfortunate surprise. She, as well, needs an escape and lists her cozy Surrey fairy-tale-like cottage on a home-exchange board. Amanda sees it, is intrigued, and they agree to an immediate swap. The very next day, in fact. This seems a bit pushed, considering the time difference between California and England, and the suddenness, especially on Amanda's part, but it's easily set aside.<br /><br />One would think that we have two stories. Yet we don't - at least, not in screen time. Granted, the movie is long (2:15), but it isn't until one hour and eleven minutes that anything of consequence happens for Iris in L.A. Prior to that, quite a bit has been going on in Surrey. Very oddly disjointed.<br /><br />Amanda is disturbed in the middle of the night (which for her would be dinnertime) by a loud pounding on the fairy-tale-cottage's door. It's Iris's brother, Graham, in what can only be called a spot-on Jude Law performance. Because of the quick swap, many things were forgotten, such as Iris's brother who often comes over to sleep off a good drunk if he spends too much time at the pub, and that Amanda has a boyfriend who will be sending people (Jack Black and his girlfriend) over to pick up his stuff.<br /><br />I'll sum it up: stuff happens between Amanda and Graham. Graham isn't quite the man he seems, and for once in the movies that's a good thing! There's a scene when Amanda surprisingly visits Graham at his house and they spend time in a, well, tent, that screams of the magic of Finding Neverland. Amanda and Graham have something together, and it's obvious to everyone. It must have been obvious to the filmmakers, because they seemed to grab a bit more than 2/3 of the total screen time.<br /><br />When we flip back to Iris in LA, it feels jolting, but Iris is growing as well. Iris, we know from observation, cries frequently. Amanda, we know from being told, hasn't cried since she was fifteen. There's some irony in that they have swapped houses. Perhaps the affect of Iris's presence will loosen up Amanda; perhaps Amanda will have a cooling influence on Iris.<br /><br />Sadly, only one of these plays through.<br /><br />Iris develops two special relationships in L.A. One is with a ninety-year old writer of many Hollywood screenplays. The other is with Miles (Jack Black). Guess which is more moving and believable?<br /><br />With Kate Winslet in the movie, it seems impossible to say this, but I will: if only she hadn't been in it. The filmmakers (I'm using this generally - who knows whose decision it was) chose to relegate her to a supporting role, when she should have shared the leading female role with Cameron Diaz (odd that her ninety-year-old friend, Arthur played well by Eli Wallach says nearly the same thing to her). Iris's L.A. story line could have been more believable, and it could have involved someone other than Jack Black. Let's keep him in Nacho Libre roles forever. He didn't belong here.<br /><br />But oh, how touching and moving it was when the film swept back to Surrey, to Amanda and Graham. This was their film. Both characters saw real, concrete and believable growth. For everything they brought to this film, it gets four stars from me - someone who was sure they would dislike the film going in.<br /><br />(Regarding the title of the review: I'm a guy.)</p></body></html>

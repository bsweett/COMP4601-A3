<meta name="summary" content="The Worst Nic Cage movie ever! No joke!"></head><body><p>There comes a time where every actor has at least one movie that bombed in the box office, and here is Nic Cage's turn.<br /><br />The begining of this movie starts with a scene that has been pulled off many times before in different time periods: Man pulls over car, car gets plowed by truck, man tries to save them, man lives in regret for not be able to.<br /><br />Afterwards, we slowly start to slouch into the life of Edward (Nic Cage) who recieves a letter from a woman he was involved with who says that her daughter is missing. First sign that it's a bad movie right here: He gets up and travels to this private island as if to say,"Well, I have nothing better to do."<br /><br />Then, to add insult to injury, the whole cast of characters are cult-like, amish-atire, creepy-slow-speaking people who pretty much scream, "Something is not right here! These people are part of a cult!" Yet it takes Edward, even with the badge of a cop, a long time to get really ticked in order to find some answers. What follows is an endless monatage of unrememerable scenes that leave you asking the questin, "Sheesh! When is this going to get better already?"<br /><br />And it doesn't stop there, even the twists in this movie have no prior setup and make no logical sense.<br /><br />Finally, the whole annoying idiotic cult, in their delusional glory, wrap this whole agonizing two hour bore-fest into the worst anit-climatic scene I've ever seen in a movie.<br /><br />Pass this one up. It is no surprise how badly it did. It's like a bad cross between Blair Wicth and village of the damned.<br /><br />Trust me, you don't want to know what the wicker man is.</p></body></html>

The quality of the production and the seemless blending of real sailing vessels, models and CGI work cannot be over-praised.  It is marvelous work in set, cinematography and sound.<p>Couple all that with a fine cast, led with the conviction and commanding (pun intended) screen presence of Russell Crowe,and tell the crackling good tale of a deadly game of cat-and-mouse played on the high seas, and you have a wonderful adventure filled with humor, action and suspense.  They got it right in all departments.<p>A straight-ahead action/adventure drama, Weir and company have produced a first rate film that stays within its period and material, lightly touching on the themes of honor and duty, without the heavy-handed, oblique references to our own times found in The Last Sumarai.  Makes us believe we are witnessing life in another time, with very different living conditions, and different notions of purpose and duty.  No extraneous material was tossed in (a romance for instance) and they play it straight.  Well worthwhile.</p></body></html>

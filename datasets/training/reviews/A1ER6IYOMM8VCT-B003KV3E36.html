<meta name="summary" content="THE BEST RAMBO SINCE FIRST BLOOD!"></head><body><p>I have always liked the original 'First Blood' film, but I hated both Rambo 2 and 3, so I had little desire to see this new entry in the series. After seeing 'Rocky Balboa' and thinking it was the best Rocky film since the original I had some curiosity to see this new entry in the Rambo series.<br /><br />While this film is short on brains, it's not short of adrenaline pumping action and stylish gore! Sure, Rambo is up to his old tricks, but this time it's a well paced film with some fun poked at the character.<br /><br />This should have been the only sequel to the original film and as far as I'm concerned....it is!</p></body></html>

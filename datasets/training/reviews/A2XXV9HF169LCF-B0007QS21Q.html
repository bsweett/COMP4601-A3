<meta name="summary" content="Why name it after the book at all?"></head><body><p>The producers give a vague wave to Asimov's book, but that's about it. Now, I'm not one of those sticklers who thinks every line in the movie should be exactly the same as in the book, but this was just silly. Why bother with the name at all? Aside from wanting to cash in on Asimov's reputation, of course.<br /><br />So Wil Smith is excellent as always, and the character of Doctor Kelvin is pretty cool (can't remember who plays her, but at least they don't alter her basic nature too much.) The plot could have been really good - part of the tragedy of this movie is how much potential it had - but the production went for big kabooms instead of any sense of realistic action. The quest for a bigger, badder action scene absolutely ruined this movie. They might have followed the three laws and used plot elements form Asimov's book, but they threw the basic laws of physics out the window and made the whole set-up "too stupid to live" for the sake of shiny effects instead of playing it straight.<br /><br />All in all, I kind of thought it was going to suck, and I wasn't wrong.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="HISTORY OR HYSTERIA?"></head><body><p>`Oliver Stone's best filmed historical novel sees Costner bringing the overly aggressive Jim Garrison into the Kennedy assassination plot as a major player, years after his sun had set  nationally. In a highly realistic tale, Garrison and wife Spacek weave an intriguing story of mafia-Cuban relations, which many today still believe to be true. Fortunately, the book "Best Evidence", followed by modern forensics seem to have cooled down the hysteria concerning gunman Oswald's need of an accomplice. Meanwhile, even the bit players including Sutherland talking in his eerie manner on a park bench, deliver top rate performances. One has to alert the public however that this film is historical fiction on the screen, not pure history. President Ford went to his grave believing that Oswald had acted alone in Dallas as a "nut",with absolutely no Cuban backing.It's a great movie, just be careful of your objectivity.</p></body></html>

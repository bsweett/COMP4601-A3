<meta name="summary" content="THE BEST CUT YET!"></head><body><p>"Alexander Revisited" is the definitive version of Oliver Stone's underrated film on the life of Alexander the Great. Stone has added almost forty minutes of footage to bring the film's running length to three hours and thirty-four minutes, including an intermission break. The new footage offers some new insight into the characters, but for the most part, allows the audience to breathe more. Scenes are now allowed to flow better, making this a more complete movie experience.<br />The great performances are made even better with the new footage, and supporting characters are fleshed out even more, especially the character of Bagoas, who we now get to feel for. The new scenes also allow us to feel with the characters emotionally.<br />Overall, this is definitely the best version of the film! If you didn't enjoy the film before, then you might enjoy this version of it. But if, like me, you did enjoy the previous versions of the film, then you're going to like this version even more! Highly recommended!<br />Movie/DVD Grade: A+</p></body></html>

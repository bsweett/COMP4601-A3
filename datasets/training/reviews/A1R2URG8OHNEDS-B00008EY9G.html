It stars John Cusack from &quot;Serendipity&quot; and this is a totally different kind of movie. &quot;Serendipity&quot; being a sweet, romantic comedy, while &quot;Identity&quot; is a dark and disturbing thriller. It is loosely based on the mystery story &quot;And Then There Was One&quot; written by crime writer Agatha Cristie. I never read the story, so I can't say how similar the two are, but I know the basic ideas, and both of the stories are pretty much the same, plot wise. An istant problem with &quot;Identity&quot; is Ray Liotta who is a terrible actor. He is similar to Dennis Quiad, who is worse. Dennis Quaid seems to overact in every movie that I see him in, including &quot;The Alamo&quot; and &quot;Far From Heaven.&quot; Liotta also overacts, only he does it worse. He never seems to be able to grab his character and steer him in the right direction. It always feels like he is reading his lines on a cue card taped on a wall. Amanda Peet was in the movie. She is a cute little actress, who is good in &quot;Something's Gotta Give&quot; and &quot;The Whole Ten Yards,&quot; but this is another actress who is in a totally different role based on her past movies. The rest of the cast seems to be filled with unknowns except for Prutt Taylor Vince who is thought was good in &quot;Simone&quot; as well as Alfred Molina, who having no clue who he was when I saw this in the theatre, but recently saw him in the comic gem &quot;Coffee and Cigarettes.&quot; <p>&quot;Identity&quot; starts off with the audience being introduced to Malcolm Rivers. He is charged with such a heavy crime, that he is about to be executed the next day. His psychiatrist wants to prove that Rivers is not mentally able to be the person to commit the crimes, and he convinced a judge to stand before Rivers and check again to make sure he didn't really commit his crimes. Miles away in a small hotel, a flash flood has brought many strangers together. George, his wife Alice, and his stepson Timmy have pulled into a hotel after an accident injured Alice. The accident had Alice getting hit by limo driver Ed, who hit her while they were changing a tire. Ed is bringing the former famous actress Caroline to wherever she needs to be. They go to the hotel after learning that the roads are flooded, and it turns out that the phones at the hotel do not work because of an accident involving a women named Paris hitting the telephone polls. Two more clusters of people come to the hotel. One is a cop named Rhodes who is bringing a murderer to someplace, and a newlywed couple. All of these people rent rooms in the hotel from Larry, and everything is alright. They agreed to wait until the storm lets up to get help. Everything is going fine until one of the guests die in a brutal way. Everyone is shocked and one by one the guests begin to die, as the remaining people try to figure out who is doing the killing, and who is going to be killed next, while also trying not to be killed, all leading up to a surprising and shocking conclusion.<p>&quot;Identity&quot; is a great thriller, and it is short enough to never be distracted by it. It seemed like it went very fast, and it only clocked in at around 95 minutes. I was really impressed by the ending, and it's one of those movies where you can't have anybody tell you what happens. It would only ruin the experience for you. Even though some movies with a surprise twist are easy to watch again, like &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; and &quot;Godsend&quot; this is not one of them. This is one of those movies where the twist affects the entire movie. In order not to ruin the movie, watch &quot;Identity&quot; and watch &quot;Matchstick Men&quot; back to back. The entire movie of &quot;Identity&quot; is based on the twist, and without it, it would be a totally different movie. The twist makes the movie better than it really is, even though this is a good movie. It is very entertaining, fun, and it has it share of good acting. Watch it once without anybody interrupting or ruining it for you, and then remember it, because it'll be better if you don't see it again. Leave a fresh image of this movie in your mind.<p>ENJOY!<p>Rated R for Strong Violence and Language.</p></body></html>

"Secret Window" is always fun, Depp is wonderful, Koepp works well with the script & direction. John Turturro, most underrated, is excellent; strong and determined. Johnny Depp never fails to entertain me. This may not be his best film, but certainly a new addition to his many personalities. There are good extras on the DVD, mostly of Koepp banging his own drum. (I liked "Stir of Echoes"...) I want to take issue that a previous reviewer said this was among the best adaptations of Stephen King. I think that Frank Darabont's adaptations of "Shawshank Redemption" and "The Green Mile" were far superior. On the tension level, though, this works for me. (I liked Rob Reiner's "Misery", too.) I'd like to have Mr. Koepp make a coherent version of a Dean Koontz book..it hasn't happened yet. Koepp could do it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="My Very First Scorsese"></head><body><p>Yes, hard to believe that I've managed to miss "Taxi Driver" and "Raging Bull", but "Gangs of New York" is truly my first foray into the films of Martin Scorsese. If this is any indication of what goes on in them, it may just be my last.<p>I had only just "heard" about this movie, and that it had something to do with 19-century New York when Marion asked me if I wanted to see it. As an amateur historian of NYC, I had no problem with that! First word that comes to mind after having seen it? Violent. Second? Disgusting. It only gets worse after that. <p>Once upon a time in New York, the Irish were trash living in a filthy and dangerous section known as the Five Points. Irish gangs battled Nativist know-nothing gangs in riotous situations.  While it is true that 19-century Five Points was a hotbed of crime and debauchery, I seriously doubt whether Boss Tweed would kowtow to anyone like Daniel Day-Lewis, the de facto king of Five Points. DD-L is indeed the best part of the movie, sounding oddly enough like an imitation of Robert De Niro. Yet, much though his performance is a tour de force, I cannot truly recommend this movie to anyone, because of the excessive violence depicted in telling the story. For instance, when DD-L becomes angry with Leonardo DiCaprio for doublecrossing him, he proceeds to stab him, brand him with a white-hot knife blade, and fairly beat him to death with his own forehead! And this wasn't even the climax of the movie. <p>For me, this was just a question of endurance as to whether I really would be able to stay to the end. Gentle Marion had long ago buried her face in her hands to block out the images on screen. Concluded with an incongruous and ugly rock music score over the end credits. <p>Bottom line? Vicious, overly violent movie, not much fun at alll.</p></body></html>

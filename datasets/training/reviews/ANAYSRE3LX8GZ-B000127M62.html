<meta name="summary" content="10 years too late! Maybe? but i dont think so"></head><body><p>Ever since the 1993 film "Jason Goes To Hell" (Friday the 13th 9) when Jason was sucked into hell and his masked remained on the ground, and unexpectedly Freddys glove pops out of the ground to grab the hockey mask and pull it down before it cuts to black with frddys evil laugh people were exciting to know that Freddy And Jason where about to be seen together and not know what to expect?<p>Well, Personally, After all these years of waiting, the feeling of wanting to see that had been almost forgotten and this film all of a sudden popped up and I was thinking it was somthing they should have done shortly after JGTH but never arrived, and IMO this movie is overdue and didnt deliver all as well as hoped for! but forgivness is found on the bonus discs as they explain that it took ten years and 17 scripts later to finally find one that would work!!<p>The disapointment for me was the effects I was hoping to see. When I heard the team who where doing the SFX was the same team who did the great death scenes in "Final Destination 2" I was really excited about what they could do with this film! But sadly the effects and killings where no where near as good and disapointed in alot of ways! but they still managed to create some awsome death scenes!<p>The plot you shouldve read or know about already is about Freddy Krueger who has been forgotten about, authorities have covered up any trace of his exsistance and the teenagers of Springwood have no idea who Freddy is! The ones who did know where all sent to a mental home and almost prison like kept there! Freddy has no power if no one is scared of him, he still has his ability to controll the dream world and enter nightmares but without any fear giving him power, he's weak and cannot do any harm. So he searches the bowels of hell ,so he says and finds Jason Voorhees who he reserects and sends out to spread the fear amongst the children and make them remember him so he can return to what he does as the dream demon!<p>At first things are going to plan, but one thing Freddy didnt count on or expect...Jason is more into killing then he is and Freddy cannot stop Jason from killing all of his suppossed victoms! And when Freddy is ticked and decides to throw Jason aside like trying to throw away a useless wrapper off a candy bar, he finds out that it is more harder then he could imagine, and the battle is on to see who is the better of the two? Is it Freddys quickness and smart witts? Or Jasons strength and stamina? youll have to see for yourself the outcome of the battle to see which winner kills all!<p>This movie of two of the screens biggest slashers locking horns is a decent movie! If your into slasher films then this one is ok! I personaly didnt find it scary, but thats me, and wasnt really satasfyd with waiting 10 years for it. but it wasnt all that bad! But i recomend you rent first, then decide if you want to buy it?<p>The bonus features, features some cool stuff, but not really memorable IMO. One thing i was particuly disapointed about was somthing i saw just before the movie was released with a behind the scenes look on the film, and England and Jason where in an interveiw and Freddy was muckign around acting silly saying he could have gone up against a 1 foot doll (chucky) or that Michael Myers guy ..what is he a mime? Englad said... it was funny. But all in all, its pretty packed with worth while material!<p>For those of you who have the DVD and havent found these yet, then i'll tell you where some hidden eggs are!(all on disc 2)<p>1. go to THE PRODUCTION, go to the second page of it, highlight "development hell" and press the RIGHT arrorw (->) you should see some slash marks highlited now? press enter! you will get a few minutes of the making of a scene at the end of the film!<p>2. go to the deleted scenes submenu, highlt the arrorw at the bottem that points right, and then press up(^) and you should get another one of those slasher markings, press enter! you will get an interveiw about a proposed ending to the film that didnt get used!<p>3. go to the production, then go to VISUAL EFFECTS, on the next screen press right(->) and select those slash marks again and you will see a computer made story board of a scene!</p></body></html>

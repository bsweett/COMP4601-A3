Starring hunk Brendan Fraser, the film became an enormous financial success and spawned two sequels. The movie deals with a bunch of archeologists in Egypt trying to find a lost treasure, but eventually unearth a "3000 year old legacy of terror". With dazzling special efects and sweeping action segments, "The Mummuy" will satisfy those who crave films with action sequences. The DVD comes with the documentary on the making of the film called "Building A Better Look", as well as commentary, deleted scenes, trailers, and much more. WNBC-TV says, the film is a "mile-a-minute chills and thrills". A neat collectible booklet comes with the set.</p></body></html>

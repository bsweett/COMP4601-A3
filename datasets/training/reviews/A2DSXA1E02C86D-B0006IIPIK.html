I guess I've lost somewhere my capacity for childhood wonder.<br /><br />Here in the mid-1930s, downtown New York and perky newspaperwoman Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) are menaced by a horde of giant, flying robots (apparently) created by the mysterious German scientist, Dr. Totenkopf. To the rescue of Polly and the Big Apple comes Joe "Sky Captain" Sullivan (Jude Law) piloting a souped up Curtiss P-40 Tomahawk complete with teeth painted on the plane's nose as last seen on Claire Chennault's Flying Tigers of World War II fame. Sullivan is (apparently) an Army pilot flying out of a nearby, semi-secret air base. In any case, the airfield is soon devastated by giant robots of a different sort, which (apparently) kidnap Joe's Head of TechnoWhiz, Dex Dearborn (Giovanni Ribisi), but not before the latter manages to convey the information that Totenkopf's HQ is (apparently) in Nepal. So, off Sullivan and Perkins go to save the world and get a scoop, respectively.<br /><br />While the visual presentation of SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW, done in a combination of richly colored elements against a background of sepia tones, is stunning, the plot is incomprehensible. Totenkopf and intentions remain pretty much nebulous, although his evil plan (apparently) involves a space ship designed to carry a male and female of the Earth's various species, like Noah's Ark, to ... where? Say, what? And the implied connection between Totenkopf and his stylized skull insignia with that of the Nazi SS-Totenkopfverbande (Death's Head Organization) was either too transparent or too obscure, I'm not sure which; the scriptwriters (apparently) remained on the fence about that one.<br /><br />I found Paltrow attractive, as usual, but there seemed minimal vibes between Polly and the Sky Captain. From the dialogue, we infer that the two formerly had a complicated relationship as Joe repeatedly voices his suspicion that Polly had previously cut the fuel line of his airplane causing it to crash - a charge Perkins consistently denies. What was that all about? I suspect that the couple's past history was more interesting than the present. In any case, there wasn't the delicious tension between the two as in, for example, ROMANCING THE STONE with Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner.<br /><br />There was one silly sequence in which Sullivan's Tomahawk retracts its air screw, dives into the ocean, deploys a water propeller, and continues on as a submarine as if nothing was amiss. Oh, puhleeeze! Chennault would've been appalled.<br /><br />SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW was perhaps best seen on the Big Screen, or now maybe viewed on a gazillion-inch, home entertainment center HDTV. But, on my 27-inch standard TV, it just seemed silly with a capital "S". Wait for the comic book version.</p></body></html>

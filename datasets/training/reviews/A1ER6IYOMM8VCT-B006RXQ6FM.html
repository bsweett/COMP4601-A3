The story is interesting, but I found it to be predictable and slow. The cast is very good, but certainly not any of their best work, although I found Streep's character to be amusing at times. The story goes where I expected it to go and if not for the last few minutes the film wouldn't have gotten that extra half a star. I liked the ending and it helped me to appreciate the film for what it is.</p></body></html>

Is it a remake?  Not necessarily.  However, it is more like a movie that pays tribute to a great classic by offering its own vision of a well-known nightmare of limbs and guts.<p>While characters and some of the story has changed, the deranged and murderous plot remains the same.  An unspeakable turn of events (I will not give away how it all starts, as it is very different from the original) lands a group of teens in a nightmarish maze that throws a mutilated man who wields a  giant chainsaw  in their path.  Not to mention the &quot;crazy&quot; family that turns out to be just as vicious and murderous.  For these teens, a safe place is nowhere in their short and painful future.<p>As I said in the beginning, this is not a remake.  Nor is this a sequel.  So what is it?  Well, I like to think of it as an &quot;updated&quot; version of the original--in fact, I consider it more of a tribute to the classic that redefined the horror genera as we know it.  This movie, while much more darker, sinister, and sicker, is not trying to live up to the original, nor is it trying to outdo it.  I had to smile, as this was not a step-by-step remake, such as the newer &quot;Psycho&quot; was.  There are new elements, characters, and plot twists thrown into the mix.  And to be honest... it works.<p>I must confess, I had an unquestionably hard time trying to watch this movie.  There were a bunch of moments that made me want to shut it off, and yet--I continued to watch the debauchery.  There is a sick and twisted fascination that this movie exploits from us, knowing that we're going continue to watch no matter what.  The original was choppy and had a very low-budget, so while it was undeniably violent and brutal it wasn't as hard to take.  This new version is in no way a Grade-B movie.  It's extremely realistic in its absolute brutality.  This shouldn't even be considered as a choice for people who have a hard time watching violence, gore and torture.  This movie takes it to the limit and is unapologetic.<p>Even though this was a hard movie to watch, I have to confess that I liked it.  It is great to finally see a horror movie that isn't overly goofy.  This is a straight-up and serious slasher movie that does what it's supposed to do--TERRIFY US.  An element sadly forgotten by most of the horror flops that come out now.  Maybe they can take a page from this movie and perhaps learn something.  The acting is surprisingly good, the script is quite believable and is rarely cheesy or lame, and the film looks fantastic.  Not a bad job for director Marcus Nispel.<p>This 2-Disc special edition (a single disc version is also available for those who aren't giant fans of the movie) has some tasty extras.  As I said, the film looks and sounds great.  You even have the choice of watching it in DTS if your little heart desires to do so.  Special features include documentaries, deleted scenes, commentary, trailers, TV spots and a whole lot more.  The star of the special features is an exclusive documentary on the notorious killer, Ed Gein, who inspired the original film.  It's a really interesting feature and is the main reason to purchase this edition of the movie.  The behind-the-scenes documentary (over an hour long) is also worth the money, as well.<p>&quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; is an unforgiving bloodbath that sends you to the butcher's with bloody front-row seats.  It's not better than the original, and it is not trying to be.  This film is more of a tribute to an undeniable classic.  It's an entertaining new vision and interpretation of the original.  If you're looking for a straight-up horror movie that isn't trying to be cutesy or is striving for pop status, then this is the one for you.  Just remember one thing... once you open the door, there's no going back.  A disturbing, and yet involving horror film that will stay in your head for days. -Michael Crane</p></body></html>

Life seems to be a run toward fulfillment with expectations that frustrate our deepest desires.  Such is the quandry for Don Johnston (Bill Murray) who is a solitary middle-aged bachelor.  His live in lover, Sherry (Julie Delpy) leaves him at the beginning.  He seems slightly startled out of his orbit, but her complaints provide the crux of his situation.  "You're never going to change," she complains.  "I don't want to be with an over-the-hill Don Juan...," and "I'm just like your mistress, except you're not even married."  Romance is certainly not elusive for Don "the Juan" Johnston, but he seems attached to the experience and not any lover.  He dreamily lives his life through dinner with wine, DVD's, and classical music, sitting almost stupor-like, oblivious to all but the nuances of his surroundings.<br /><br />It is, however, at this transition that he receives a mysterious pink letter.  In it he is told by a former lover that he fathered their boy who is now about twenty years older and set on a sojourn to find and meet him.  She relates some of his personality traits, but otherwise leaves his son mysterious.  The handwriting is unrecognizable, and the letter is unsigned.  Meanwhile, he makes his best emotional connection with his next door neighbor friend, Winston (Jeffrey Wright), an Ethiopian emigre' who works hard, is an amiable presence, and works three jobs while grooming to be a freelance mystery writer.  His family, including his precocious and cute daughter, Rita (Brea Frazirer) provides a vicarious outlet for Don to the family life.  Don is clueless to any emotional connection to his newly identified son, but Winston, naturally, is fascinated.  After a series of meetings between the two friends, Winston has gathered a whole plan to find the mother and lover who bore Don's son.  Winston's detective sensibilities provide the addresses, workplaces, and MapQuest directions (even a burned soundtrack C.D. for his romantic quest).  At first Don resists, then he is convinced:  It is fascinating and worthwhile to connect with the past.  "Bring pink flowers...look for red typewriter ribbon and pink stationery...just say you're checking in..." are the key words Winston advises to make the trek work.<br /><br />The movie makes emotional connections by rejuvenating Don's spirit at times.  It provides all of the awkwardness one would expect to find in an adult comedy.  Fragments of his former love lives come to roost.  Sometimes it is refreshing (as with Laura [Sharon Stone]), and sometimes it is downright awkward (as with Dora [Frances Conroy] when he finds her married to a man who remembers him as a past love interest, while expounding on trite pleasantries during dinner about how their marriage is so wonderful.)  It is here that Murray shows his comic prowess.  Much of the humor is written on his face (not unlike Bob Newhart, only here he is more subtle with less agitation).  Besides that all of the encounters have that school reunion uneasiness where everyone stares at one another until the other party recognizes the addressed guest.  The four encounters with the would-be mothers provide anything from the sublime to the tragic.<br /><br />We leave 'Broken Flowers' with tender longing.  The film is not entirely unlike Bill Murray's other acting achievement 'Lost in Translation'.  There is loneliness presented in distant worlds with whimsey and aching trying to break through the pattern of longing and unrealized fulfillment.  Don Johnston may or may not fulfil his inquiry into life's rich enigma's, but Jim Jamusch's directing perfects with bullseye precision this fascinating, easy chair trek.  And, just like 'Lost in Translation,' we too, have been transported by the same sojourn as the protagonist.  Some of the movie is deliberately slow moving with a reflectiveness that deserves the treatment of its subject matter.  The aftermath of 'Broken Flowers' leaves us to reflect on our own thoughts about our own world in all of its possibilities...</p></body></html>

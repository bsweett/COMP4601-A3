<meta name="summary" content=""COME INTO ME!"  ~  Perceiving The Metaphysical Landscape"></head><body><p>What is it about this 1973 film dealing with the subject of demonic possession that still has such a tight grip on our collective imaginations? Now some thirty years after its theatrical release it still warrants enough interest to generate over 700 reviews on Amazon.com.<br /><br />It certainly isn't just the special effects, which are quite good, because they can easily be outdone with today's technology. Nor can it be explained away by pointing to societies perverse fascination with grotesque images, foul language and projectile pea soup. It's not even the excellent cast, director (William Friedkin) or production values that make this one of the most gripping, unforgettable treatments of spiritual evil ever captured on film.<br /><br />I think the secret is found in something unspoken, but heard nonetheless. Something hinted at on-screen only in fleeting images that remain with us long after they've vanished into the darkness. This "Unspoken Something" I'm referring to is perfectly captured in the opening prologue of the film, that moment at the archeological dig site in Iraq.<br /><br />Prologue: As the sun sets on the far horizon Father Lankester Merrin finds himself alone. A moment later a pack of dogs begin to growl and fight amongst the ruins just as the wind picks up and swirls of red dust fill the air. Father Merrin realizes he is no longer alone. On a nearby mound stands a statue, a ancient representation of a powerful demon known to the Assyrians and Babylonians as Pazuzu. Merrin stands motionless as he looks deeply into the features of his adversary. They have met before. The essence of this film is encapsulated in this brief moment of realization. The battle for a human soul is about to begin.</p></body></html>

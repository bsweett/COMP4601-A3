<meta name="summary" content="A huge improvement over the 2003 film"></head><body><p>I was not as down on the 2003 Ang Lee version of the story of the big green guy (note:  as first drawn by Jack Kirby, he was gray, though he very quickly underwent a color change) as many, but it clearly wasn't as good as it ought to have been.  The biggest fault was the CGI.  Although according to the official Marvel specs the Hulk can leap several miles in a single bound, it was rather silly watching him do so.  For one thing, he would bounce several hundred yards in a single, impossibly quick leap.  As a result the Hulk appears to have no mass or even any reality.  You simply couldn't buy into the fantasy.  The Hulk in this film, on the contrary, possessed only a fraction of the leaping ability of the Ang Lee Hulk -- possessing vastly less mobility than the comic book version as well -- but the gains were enormous, with the new Hulk having mass, solidity, and some reality.  Some of this could be laid on the development of new CGI software since 2003, but more than that was simply the decision to make him denser and slower.  When the 2003 Hulk moved I cringed; when the new one moved I had a great time.<br /><br />By all accounts Edward Norton was deeply involved in the making of the movie, and not merely as the star.  Though he did not receive official writing credit, enough people working on the project have acknowledged that he wrote a complete draft that featured many elements that were incorporated in the final film and that he was rewriting scenes immediately before shooting.  This is not new for Norton.  He has been involved in the writing of the scripts for many of his films, usually with no credit.  It is expected that he will write the draft for any Hulk sequel.<br /><br />Sequels.  Although THE INCREDIBLE HULK did not do as well at the box office this summer as they had hoped, the film did make money.  Part of the disappointment might have resulted from the far superior box office performance of IRON MAN.  One of the executive producers of THE INCREDIBLE HULK has insisted that she plans on making a sequel with Norton at the center of things.  And with Marvel Studios clearly moving towards an Avengers movie, the Hulk would clearly play a role.  The Hulk, however, is one Avenger who can either be friend or foe, either a member of the team or the Big Bad of the movie.  There have been no official announcements as of yet, but the final scene in the film, showing Tony Stark approaching a very drunk General Ross in a bar and telling him, "We are putting together a team," shows that the team is being put together.  General Ross had a portrait of Steve Rodgers (i.e., Captain America) on his office wall and a cut scene from THE INCREDIBLE HULK showed a glimpse of Captain America in frozen ice.  Upcoming films focusing on Thor and (believe it or not) Ant-Man show that Marvel does indeed intend to put the whole team together as soon as feasible.  I think it is going to take a bit longer than they had hoped.  Films that were earlier announced for 2010 and 2011 are still in pre-production.  I think 2012 and 2013 is more likely.  They have also been set back by casting problems.  Daniel Craig turned down an offer to star as Thor.  At least the news shows their intent to continue to cast major actors in the key roles.<br /><br />THE INCREDIBLE HULK begins in medias res, giving a bit of a recap of a prequel that never quite existed (the events recounted are not quite the same as the Ang Lee film) in the opening credits to jump to Bruce Banner in Rio de Janeiro, where he is living while working on a cure to his condition.  I think this was a brilliant decision.  As a result they could just go ahead and skip the "making of the Hulk" story that is a crucial part of almost all superhero movies.  One of my beefs with most of movies of the genre is that we don't really get anything new for fans of the comics.  IRON MAN was redeemed by a fantastic lead performance by Robert Downey Jr.  I'm not saying that Edward Norton wasn't good in this film, but a lot of the joy of the film is that we got to move the whole story forward.  I liked the decision to focus on the Abomination, though they altered him a bit from his classic presentation, making him larger than the Hulk, whereas in the official Marvel spec sheet he is slightly smaller.  Tim Roth is great in the film as Klonsky/The Abomination.  And just as in the comics the Hulk does not kill him, but is locked away by the military, so in this film he resists, at Betty's pleading, the temptation to kill him.<br /><br />This later detail actually points to how much the film goes out of the way to acknowledge both the larger world of Marvel Comics and its prior versions of the Hulk.  In the earlier category are things like references to Nick Fury in the opening credits and the portrait of Steve Rodgers, but also the slightly bulging head of Dr. Sterns near the end of the film (foreshadowing his possible appearance in a sequel as The Leader).  In the latter we get things like Bruce Banner watching THE COURTSHIP OF EDDIE'S FATHER in Portugese in Brazil, which starred, of course, Bill Bixby, who played David Banner in the TV version of The Hulk.  Lou Ferrigno, who played Banner when he turned green, played a security guard (and I have to say, was looking pretty good) and voiced the Hulk.  And Toronto actor Paul Soles, who plays the pizza joint owner Sandy, voiced Bruce Banner in the sixties cartoon version of the comic (he also did Peter Parker in the cartoon version of Spider-Man).<br /><br />I think the superiority of this new film could mainly be seen in the great fight scene from the end of the picture in which the Hulk and the Abomination face off.  Most such fight scenes in movies are either disappointing or anti-climatic, sometimes merely a necessary add on.  But this one was exciting, involving, and helped move along the story of Bruce Banner's transformation as something more than just an enraged monster.<br /><br />This is not as good as IRON MAN, but it was the second of two very good films that represent the initial products of Marvel's new film production company.  If forthcoming productions are as good as these two, then we have a lot of great popular entertainment to look forward to.</p></body></html>

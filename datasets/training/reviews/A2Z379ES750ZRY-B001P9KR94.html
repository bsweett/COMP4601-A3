<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining, but Oscar's "Best Picture"??? Ya gotta be kidding."></head><body><p>No doubt, this movie is entertaining, but is it an Academy Award winner for Best Picture?  The acting is a bit stiff, the story is Ok, the cinematography is amateurish.<br />The story is very linear and straight forward....no surprises really.<br /><br />It just seems that this film kinda went "viral" on the Academy and they jumped on the bandwagon and decided to purge themselves of guilt towards those that are impoverished and award this movie Best Picture.  On the other hand, there wasn't that much to choose from in 2008.</p></body></html>

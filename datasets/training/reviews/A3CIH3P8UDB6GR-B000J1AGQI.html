Overall, the story was good, and it was just passionate scene with Mel and Pepper at the end. I bought this for my HD Collection and I'm happy to say that it was worth the purchase!  Although, its not the best HD DVD Movie that I own, it is certainly a great movie about a war.  Keep me at the edge of my seat! Good war movies, and I hate war movies, but it drew me in every minute.  Atleast give it a watch to see if you would like it before you by the Standard or HD version.</p></body></html>

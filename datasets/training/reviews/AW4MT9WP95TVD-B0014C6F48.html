<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly Good"></head><body><p>We rented this one quiet evening as a diversion and exected nothing more than a retread of Big.  Well, it kinda is and it kinda isn't.  Garner acccepts more quickly the adult role than Hanks' character did and the plot here revolves more around making a better adult of herself than she became when she wished for it.  Garner is charming and is really responsible for keeping the film alive.  Ruffalo is fine - but it's not a role that showcases the guy's talent.  No real belly laughs, but a sweet story that deserves a viewing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A good I ndian is a dead Indian"></head><body><p>This film is slightly better than most films with John Wayne, but in retrospective. A farm is attacked by some Indians. Everyone is killed except a very young girl who is taken along by the Indian chief. The film is the story of the tracking of this chief and the salvaging, retrieval and liberation of the girl who was made the chief's wife, one of them. It shows how the girl will, when found, ask for her fellow whites to consider her life is set and settled now and that she must be left to her lot. They will fail this first time but they will go on searching for her and they will finally trap the Indian community and they will demonstrate their great generosity by killing all the Indians and only recuperating the white girl by force. At the time when the film came out it was vindicating that genocidal treatment of Indians based on the myth that the whites had the right to take Indian land without even paying for it. Today it is a perfect demonstration how deep that genocidal spirit is engrained in the American consciousness of history. We have to celebrate the very recent decision of Congress to provide some Indians with reparations for the way they were treated, even after having been parked in reservations, as a miracle of faithfulness to the principles of the Declaration of Independence, for whose Founding Fathers there was no doubt that Indians and enslaved or indentured people, mostly Black, were not born equal, because they were not born human. The film shows how the dominant culture in the USA and in Hollywood used the genocide of the Indians as a good conscience builder among the whites who were engaged in so many wars all around the world against "minority races".<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID</p></body></html>

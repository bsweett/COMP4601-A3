The scene of lava from Brazil is just wrong but hilarious. The bridesmaid Annie needs to get her head on straight and stand up for herself when others don't treat her right, but instead she vents on the wrong people. The Wilson Philips song at the end is a good theme song for her. I love Megan because she is so genuine.</p></body></html>

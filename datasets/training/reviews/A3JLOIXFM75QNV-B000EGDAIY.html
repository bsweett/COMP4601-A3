People enter and house and get mysteriously killed off one by one. Ok, sounds interesting. But in reality, it was on the slow side. I just couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters, and I think that weakened the movie for me. The premise is interesting, but it just didn't deliver.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="American Satire"></head><body><p>American Psycho left the same impression on me that The Talented Mr. Ripley did; An unsatisfying or unfulfilled ending. It is not necessarily that I expected for Bateman to get his upcommance.Maybe I just missed the powerful subtlety of the climax of the film itself. Christian Bale is an excellent actor who must have had some kind of personal chuckle imitating an uptight, arrogant, wall-street American yuppie. Even his &quot;American&quot; accent was flawless !He played a character that you really not only hated for his literal cutthroat antics but for his annoying behavior and obessession as a neat freak !Yet, there appeared to be times in the story where his &quot;sickness&quot; was also a cry for help...like a rabid or diseased dog waiting to be caught and put out of it's misery. Bale gets 5 stars for his stellar performance.<p>My understanding of the film was that it was a twisted/dark satirical comedy coinciding with a slasher/thriller movie (sort of like a recording artist ala Sarah Brightman singing opera while on the next track singing a pop ballad all on the same album); Different genres within the same context or realm. It was not just about a nutcase hacking people, but it was also a social commentary about commercialism, consumerism, and capitalism (the &quot;holy trintiy&quot; of Wall Street and upper class America)!<p>This film falls under the category of &quot;eclectic and off-beat&quot;. While it sports all the glamor and typical nuance of a Hollywood big budget film it also serves well as an art house independent film for the Cannes Film Festival !</p></body></html>

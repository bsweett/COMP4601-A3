Superbly written and acted, featuring Spielberg's favorite everyman in Richard Dreyfuss who sees lights in the night sky. He can't explain it and against the wishes of those around him, feels compelled to investigate this frustrating enigma that becomes clear. Featuring powerhouse special effects and awesome score by John Williams. This is the movie that makes you think: ARE WE ALONE?</p></body></html>

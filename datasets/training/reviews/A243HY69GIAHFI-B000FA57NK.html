<meta name="summary" content="Don't buy anything but the Special Edition DVD"></head><body><p>Others have remarked well enough on the virtues of _Apollo 13_ as a film.  What makes the Special Edition DVD worth its purchase price, however, are the tons of extras that you get.  The story of the making of _Apollo 13_ is  at least as interesting, if nowhere near as harrowing, as the actual  moonshot itself, and this DVD gives you hours of material to walk you  through that process.  <p>Anyone who's interested in filmmaking will be  riveted by both the Ron Howard running film commentary and the hour-long  &quot;Making of&quot; documentary.  Perhaps even more intriguing is the  Marilyn and Jim Lovell audio track, in which you get to hear how Lovell  feels about Howard and Hanks made his movie.  This is made all the more  interesting and informative for the filmmaking student in that _Apollo 13_  wasn't just the retelling of Lovell's real-life experience, it's also the  film version of his book.  Getting his perspective both as narrative object  and storyteller is fascinating, as are Marilyn's observations on Kathleen  Quinlan's Academy-nominated performance.  <p>Combine all this with the  superb technical brilliance of the encoding here, and you've got a DVD  that's entirely worth the surprisingly modest price.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="IN THE SHADOW OF RAY"></head><body><p>Kevin Spacey's homage to the charismatic Bobby Darin was vastly overshadowed by the release of RAY the same year.  While one can't help but find praise for Spacey's co-writing, directing, acting, singing and dancing, the main problem with BEYOND THE SEA is that unlike RAY, Spacey chose to add fantasy elements and production numbers that invalidated the biopic status.  While RAY painted a straightforward picture of the dynamic Charles, the script didn't sugarcoat Ray's vices and Jamie Foxx was so much Ray Charles, the film overwhelms Spacey's flick.  Also, many key "truths" about Darin were eliminated from the film:  his love for Connie Francis, which was squelched by her overprotective father; his courting of Sandra Dee's mother prior to his pursuit of Ms. Dee; his eventual divorce from Dee and his remarriage---these elements weren't touched and thus in BEYOND THE SEA, we don't get an honest, complete biopic.<br /><br />BUT, Spacey is dynamite; one can tell his respect for Darin's abilities and his singing is surprisingly good, and his dancing ain't half bad either.  Kate Bosworth captures the naivete and innocence of Sandra Dee, while demonstrating her stubborness and ultimate decline into alcohol abuse; Caroline Aaron is dynamite as Darin's "sister" who has her own dark secret; and newcomer William Ullrich does a nice job as the young Darin.<br /><br />While the technique of using a movie about Darin's life is unique, it undermines a lot of the substance of the film, and if Spacey decided to fictionalize parts of the movie, which parts were the audience supposed to believe?<br /><br />If you're a fan of Darin, you will probably cozy up to the image Spacey has given us, and even if you aren't one can't deny the amount of professionalism in this movie.  Just don't believe everything you see.</p></body></html>

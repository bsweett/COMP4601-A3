What this film lacked, was a character as dynamic as Indiana Jones and a plausible storyline.  Also, it appeared that this movie was filmed in black and white and then colorized (to give it an old movie feel).  I think it might have been better if they just stuck to black and white (I hate the look of colorized movies).<br /><br />There were a lot of good special effects, such as when Gwyenneth Paltrow is manuvering through skyscrapper sized mechanical men and some comic relief that you had to be quick to catch (there is an image of Godzilla attacking Tokyo).  Angelina Jolie is the highlight of the movie, giving a fine performance as a very proper British commander of an armada of flying aircraft carriers (if that makes sense).  I think a sequel with her character as the star would work a lot better.</p></body></html>

I felt the same way about this:  the plot was far too convoluted to have been a movie.  In fact, I sat through this with a fan who knew all about it.  I had to pepper him with questions right up until the very end.  Not a good sign.<br /><br />Some other observations:<br /><br />1.  The soundtrack for this blows.  No, let me try to be more articulate.  It frequently was a jarring mish-mash between the music and what was happening onscreen.  It was almost as if somebody had put their iPod on random and pushed "play".<br /><br />2.  What's with all the slow motion these days?  Good grief.  It's getting out of hand.  At one point, the characters are crossing the street in slow motion!<br /><br />3.  They should have delimited Dr. Manhattan's powers more believably.  By the time he's smooching that chick on Mars I had pretty much checked out of the movie.<br /><br />4.  What?  No minorities among the Watchmen?  Unacceptable!  When is Hollywood going to learn: the only justification for casting white people is if you need a villain, an airhead, or a gender-bending misfit.</p></body></html>

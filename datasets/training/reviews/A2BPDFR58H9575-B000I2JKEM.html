It starts in the Victorian England and tells of a young man, Victor who is to marry a girl he never met, named Victoria (Victor and Victoria in the Victorian England). Victor and Victoria fell in love from the first sight but unknown for him, Victor finds himself married to Emily, a mysterious Corpse bride, and taken to the world of dead which in Burton's movie is much more colorful, friendlier, and jollier than the world of living...<br /><br />With the running time only 76 minutes, "Corpse Bride" simply does not have time to become boring. It is funny, charming, and refreshingly effective in its use of the stop-motion animation in the age of the advanced computer technology. Some characters are absolutely hilarious, for example, a cute green maggot that lives in Emily's skull and pops out from her eye with the smart remarks and comments. The songs are nice; especially the one that tells the horrific story of the Corpse Bride in such colorful way that you would not stop smiling. Danny Elfman, the film's composer provided voice for Bonejangles, the singer. I also noticed the use of the elegant cutout-style animation with the hypnotizing backgrounds very much in the style of "Die Abenteuer des Prinzen Achmed" (1926) directed by Lotte Reiniger, which is the oldest surviving animated feature film.</p></body></html>

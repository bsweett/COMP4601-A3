My earliest memories of the man come from the 1970s and early 1980s, roughly the last ten or so years of his life. People told me he once had Hollywood in the palm of his hand, that he was a cinematic genius, and that his tempestuous relationships with the studios ruined his career. An impressive list of information pointing to a powerful man, wouldn't you say? Sadly, I heard these things when Welles was doing wine commercials to make ends meet. "We'll sell no wine before its time" doesn't evoke visions of a cinematic genius, that's for sure. Nor did his physical presence impress me all that much. Orson Welles, according to information I have seen, weighed nearly 350 pounds at one point and remained severely obese until the end of his life. I'm not knocking on people with weight problems, but it's just another example of how difficult it was for me to imagine the man as a Hollywood heavyweight (no pun intended). Then I grew up and watched some of his classic films, i.e. "Touch of Evil," "Citizen Kane," and the incredibly atmospheric "The Third Man." The glowing accolades started making a lot more sense. No wonder filmgoers love this guy's films; they're masterpieces in nearly every way.<br /><br />"The Third Man" takes place in the shattered ruins of post-World War II Vienna. Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton), an alcoholic hack who bangs out western novels, arrives in town to a mystery greater than anything he ever wrote about. His old friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles) sent him a letter some time before offering him a job in Vienna, but Martins discovers when he gets there that his pal recently perished in an unfortunate traffic accident. The writer shows up in time to witness Lime's funeral and to meet his buddy's beautiful girlfriend Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli). He also runs afoul of the British occupation force, especially Major Calloway (Trevor Howard), a man who has nothing nice to say at all about Harry Lime. In fact, Calloway insists that Martins leave town immediately, much to the writer's consternation. Fortunately for Holly, a local reading group discovers he is an author and invites him to give a lecture a few days down the road. This gives Martins an excuse to stick around and investigate the increasingly suspicious nature of his old friend's passing. Questions about how the accident unfolded bring conflicting answers from witnesses. Anna Schmidt, who faces a possible expatriation to the Soviet Union's sector of the city, provides few answers to Martins's questions. Something sinister is going on in Vienna, and Holly Martins wants to get to the bottom of it.<br /><br />I'm not spoiling a thing by saying that Harry Lime never perished in that traffic accident. Why he staged his own passing, and how Holly Martins discovers the ruse, is the central element of "The Third Man." It turns out Lime is involved in a particularly loathsome black market scheme, along with several unsavory European characters, that threaten the health of Vienna's children. Calloway shows Martins up close what Lime's handiwork has done to the city's youths. The British have been on Lime's trail for ages, and that is why he doesn't want Holly Martins lurking around Austria. Once the British officer knows that the writer isn't about to condone what his friend is doing, he lets him in on the case and tries to use Martins to bring Lime out of the woodwork. There are only two things complicating the search for Harry Lime: Martins falls in love with Anna Schmidt and Lime is one slick operator who isn't about to go down without a fight. When the two old friends finally meet on a Ferris wheel, the encounter turns into a memorable exposition on the merits of right and wrong. Despite Lime's blithe belief in what he's doing for a buck, his time is about to run out. Holly Martins can't save his friend even as he cannot convince Anna to give up her love for Harry. The two sequences at the end of the film, the sewer chase and the funeral scene, will stay you with for eons.<br /><br />What's not to like about this movie? Try as I might, I can't think of anything I would want to see changed. The performances are magisterial, the dialogue transcendent, and the set pieces perfectly match the sordid storyline. Repeatedly, memorable scenes march across the screen. The shadow of the guy with the balloons looming on the buildings, the vividness of the wet cobblestones in the nighttime street scenes, and the hunted look on Harry Lime's face as the authorities corner him in the sewer like the rat he is all stick in the memory banks with the tenacity of molasses. Just as memorable is Anton Karas's zither score, an odd choice for a noir film yet a tune that fits the story perfectly and will have you humming for weeks afterwards. The question I ought to ask should go something like this: what I can say about this marvelous picture that hasn't been said by others a million times before? No one with an ounce of appreciation for the cinematic form, regardless of their personal favorites, can deny the beauty and power of this film.<br /><br />Criterion goes above and beyond the call of duty with their DVD version of the film. Supplements are plentiful and lengthy: an alternate opening voice narration track, footage of Anton Karas playing the movie's theme on his famous zither, a short documentary about how the Viennese police patrol their extensive sewer system, an introduction by Peter Bogdanovich, episodes from Welles's Harry Lime radio show, and much more. The picture quality looks great, the sound quality is very nice, and the movie is a masterpiece. Don't wait as long as I did to see this phenomenal picture; it's every bit as good as you've heard.</p></body></html>

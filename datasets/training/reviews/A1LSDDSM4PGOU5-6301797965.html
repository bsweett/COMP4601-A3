<meta name="summary" content="works wells as a straight monster movie (3.6/5)"></head><body><p>i liked this film a lot.there were a lot of memorable lines to be<br />sure.i chuckled a fair amount at some of the jokes and gags.but to<br />me,this movie works more as a monster movie.making it in black and<br />white was a stroke of genius.it made it much more authentic,just like<br />the old monster movies of the 30's and 40's.i think it's one of the<br />best Frankenstein movies i've seen.Gene Wilder is in great form here,as<br />is Teri Gar.Marti Feldman is a riot.Peter Boyle is also great.and<br />Cloris Leachman puts in another brilliant performance.and we can't<br />forget Madeline Khan.of the first four Mel Brooks films i have just<br />seen,this is the best one.for me,Young Frankenstein is a 3.6/5</p></body></html>

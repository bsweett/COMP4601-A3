<meta name="summary" content="A Movie That Can Really Change your view of Law Enforcement"></head><body><p>This is a pretty good movie and now 10 years might still be a classic.  It is played on many cable channels all the time, but buy or rent it to get the uncut version.(Exception HBO or Cinemax) It will really open your eyes to a different form of justice for a cop that really does not go bad, but takes his arrests to a new level of personal enforcement.  Denzel Washington's character is not necessarily the bad guy but uses very risky tactics to perform his job where no one will tell him differently.  There are many great scenes in this film but the one with Snoop Dog is one of my favorites.  It will be interesting to see the new roles Washington takes up in the future but would be hard to top this one.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller</p></body></html>

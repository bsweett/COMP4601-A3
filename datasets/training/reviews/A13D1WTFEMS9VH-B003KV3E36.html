<meta name="summary" content="Oh yeah - now THAT'S what I'm talkin' about!"></head><body><p>This is a GREAT action movie and a thoroughly awesome example of a Blu-Ray presentation. The technical aspects of the battle scenes rival those in 'Saving Private Ryan' -- and, perhaps, even raise the bar. And who better to turn Rambo loose upon than those creeps running the military dictatorship in Myanmar (Burma). No one deserves a giant-size can of whoop-a$$ opened up on them more than these thugs!<br /><br />I was so glad that, after loving the first 'Rambo' movie (First Blood), and being wholly disappointed with #s 2&3, that 'Rambo' is back...way back...to the wall...HOME RUN! Right on, bubba!</p></body></html>

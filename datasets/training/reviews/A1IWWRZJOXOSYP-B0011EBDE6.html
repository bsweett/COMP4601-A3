It played endlessly and was interesting.  "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou" was really very boring and awful for me.  It didn't spark.  It wasn't funny.  "Darjeeling Limited" is much like that film.  Anderson was nominated for an Oscar along with Owen Wilson for "The Royal Tenenbaums."  He won a "Best Original Screenplay" award for this film with Jason Schwartzman from New York Film Critics Online.  I enjoyed having much of the film set in India.  It gave it a mystical quality.  The featurette on the DVD was interesting to watch how they used Indian artists to paint the train and all of the symbolic meaning to the pictures that one doesn't focus upon within the context of the film.<br /><br />The reason this film didn't work for me was that while it seemed to be trying to go in different directions at the same time, one of those was comedy.  Owen Wilson's Francis had no serious level to his characterization; neither was he funny.  He had energy and was interesting, but seemed mostly odd.  Jason Schwartzman who is the son of Talia Shire from the Rocky movies was most interesting in the short "The Hotel Chevalier."  However, while Natalie Portman's lack of dress was interesting, the short prologue film was open-ended with no sense of climax.  Schwartzman's Jack was a self-centered rich kid with hormones.  It seemed like he was playing a sad sack brand of comedy, but it wasn't funny.  Adrien Brody was simply in the wrong movie at the wrong time.  He spent much of his time as Peter wandering around in boxer shorts, abandoning his pregnant wife over issues of commitment.  Perhaps the most interesting thing in the film is when he admits that he got married with the idea that they'd get divorced.  Amara Karan does a nice job as the train's hostess Rita who balances a relationship with the Chief Steward played by Waris Ahluwalia.  These characters brought a sense of story to the film as we seemed to drop in on their relationship at a critical point.  Angelica Huston won her Best Supporting Actress Oscar for "Prizzi's Honor" in 1985.  She was inexplicable in this film, abandoning her kids to help a remote village, not going to her husband's funeral, and then disappearing before anything was resolved.  While the other actors seemed to be trying to be funny, Huston was decidedly dramatic, adding to the completely disjointed feel of the film.  Wallace Wolodarsky who was in "Life Aquatic" and played Brandon seemed very ordinary.  I did enjoy the two busybody German ladies played by Trudy Mathis & Margot Godros.  They were funny.  Overall, this film didn't work for me on most levels.  Taxi!</p></body></html>

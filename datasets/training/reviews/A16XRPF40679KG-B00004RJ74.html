<meta name="summary" content="better than echo bridges."></head><body><p>This movie is a four star fun fest from the 90's but this blu ray is cut rate with no extras at all , however the picture looks much better than on the truly awful<br />echo bridge blu ray from the states. However alliance could have done a better job on this; only they didn't.  The blu ray is less than four stars but many blus have used; just like this one; the best print around with no cleanup. Unfortunately this fun flick wasn't given the top treatment. however it's not a bad as lets say halloween h20 looks on blu ray.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This film is amazing!!"></head><body><p>The film focuses on a man named Leonard Shelby ( Guy Pierce). He is obsessed with finding his wife's killer. On the night his wife was killed, he gets his head knocked while attempting to save her. This causes him to develop a condition. Leonard can only remember everything that happened up until the night of his wife's murder. He cannot make new memories, and forgets everything five minutes after it happens. This forces him to live a life based on a endless supply of notes, poloroids, and tatoos that he puts all over his body. We are introduced to the two main people in his life - Teddy ( Joe Pantoliano) and Natalie ( Carrie Ann Moss). Both claim to be a friend to him, but things are not as they seem. Both Teddy and Natalie have personal reasons behind wanting to help Leonard. Now Leonard must not only track down his wife's killer and deal with his condition, but he must also determine who's friend, and who's foe. <p>I am a sucker for a good mystery, and &quot;Memento&quot; is the most original and well executed mystery film that I have ever seen. The story is suspenseful and extremely complex. I love how Christopher Nolan had the film unfold in reverse. You come to feel very frustrated over the course of the film. However, that is also why the story is brilliant. You find yourself starting to feel exactly how Leonard does. This actually involves you in the film personally, and makes you sympathize for Leonard overall. The film's focus keeps switching back and forth between Leonard's search for the killer, and flashbacks into Leonard's prior life as an insurance investigator and his big case with a man named Sammy Jenkis ( Stephen Tobolowsky). I loved this aspect of the film, because Sammy suffers from the same condition as Leonard's. &quot;Memento&quot; is also guaranteed to keep you guessing. The film continually dangles clues in front of you. But since the story is told in reverse, what you are seeing, may not be what it seems! The film could not have succeeded without the performances given from the sctors. Guy Pierce's portrayal of Leonard is one of the best that I have ever seen. It is so realistic, and so convincing, that you come to believe that Guy Pearce actually went through the same thing himself. The fact that he made such a difficult role look so easy, still amazes me to this day. Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Ann Moss are also great. Their performances add to the film's suspense, because you never know what to believe. <p>Christopher Nolan's &quot;Memento&quot; is amazing. The film has great acting, a nice script, an intense, complex story, and an outstanding ending. The limited edition DVD only adds to the already flawless film. This 2 disc limited edition DVD is great because there are mindbenders and challenges you have to go through to get to the film. That brings the meaning of the word &quot;interactive&quot; to a whole new level! The special features include a Sundance Channel Documentary, the original short story By Jonathan Nolan, and much more.</p></body></html>

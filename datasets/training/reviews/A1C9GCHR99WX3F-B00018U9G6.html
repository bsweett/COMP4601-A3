<meta name="summary" content="A great film for people who like to watch musicals"></head><body><p>If you like movies like this, or musicals then you might be sure to like &#34;School of Rock&#34;, in which stars Jack Black, or is it &#34;The School of Rock&#34;, I don't know. Also staring in the film is Joan Cusack, and when you add a room full of kids, how much more do you need? But do you really need to be a fan of Jack Black to enjoy this movie, and I don't know if you can call this film a family film since it is rated PG-13. As the movie opens, Dewey Finn (Jack Black) loves music, and plays with his band, which he takes long solos and dives into the crowd, but during a concert me makes a dive, but falls to the ground, and the next morning he is woken up by his roommate Ned Schneebly (Mike White) and his bossy girlfriend Patty (Sarah Silverman), who wants Dewey to pay his share of the rent, but he doesn't have him, and he owes his room mate 2,200 dollars, and has no way to pay him back, for I guess back share of the rent. She tells him that he has to come with the money by the end of the week, or he will have to move out. Dewey advice his roomate to dump her, but Ned doesn't want to because he is afarid that he may never have another girlfriend again. Ned works at a substitute teacher, that he working to become a cetrifed teacher, and then his band decides to take the upcoming band of bands, seriously, and they fire him, and replaces by the time he finds out. And Dewey is mad to hear that he band has decided to vote him out of the banbd, so he decides to form a new one, even though he if the founder of the band that kicked him out of the band, then a call from a Rosalie Mullins (Joan Cusack)  who is the  principal of a prep school named Horce Green, lookingo for Ned who came reccomend by a person from another school, to sub for a teacher name Mrs. Dumbam when she falls, and brakes her leg. Dewey shows up to the school pretending to be Ned, and takes the job. At first he tells the kids to have ressces, nad tears down dermit sheet, and tells the kids there will be no grades, gold stars or demits. And the next day, he just sleeps at the desk, until one of the students wants to learn from the teacher, but when Dewey discovers that the kids can play music, he turns the classroom into a studio by the time that they come back from music class, and soon everybody has a job in a class project, and he puts 3 of the studnets, including one of th student Summer (Miranda Cosgrove) groupies, but she finds out that her job is to sleep with the band, I get from an on;-ine disctory, this is what groupie means:<br /><br />Main Entry: group?ie<br /><br />Pronunciation: 'gr&uuml;-pE<br /><br />Function: noun<br /><br />1 : a fan of a rock group who usually follows the group around on concert tours<br /><br />2 : an admirer of a celebrity who attends as many of his or her public appearances as possible<br /><br />3 : ENTHUSIAST, AFICIONADO &#60;a political groupie&#62; &#60;golf groupies&#62;<br /><br />And then Dewey/Ned gives her a promtion to band manger, and puts her in charge of everything. Now if Dewey reall is the founder of the band that kicks him out, why doesn't he disband the band, I don't know.</p></body></html>

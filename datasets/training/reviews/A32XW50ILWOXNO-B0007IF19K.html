<meta name="summary" content="More documentary than drama."></head><body><p>"Ray" is a decent prestige picture with a piece of excellent, Academy Award-winning mimicry at its center. Jamie Foxx as Ray Charles. The honors are deserved.<br /><br />But Foxx inhabits the late soul singer instead of interpreting him, making for scenes that approach documentary. But the performance sets a slightly distant emotional tone that renders every flourish from director Taylor Hackford as contrived or sentimental.<br /><br />Some of them are - a drug rehabilitation sequence, for example, is faux art crap - but some of them probably wouldn't be if Foxx had approached the role with more humor. Though it touches on his flaws - heroin addiction, adultery - "Ray" so reveres the man and his struggle that the movie is less a celebratory trip than a two-and-a-half-hour life lesson.<br /><br />It's kind of edifying. It's kind of a bore.<br /><br />We watch Foxx bounce from gig to gig, town to town, signing to old recordings of Charles (they sound good but, again, distant, as if heard through a radio filter), getting hooked to smack, collecting mistresses, recalling with horror the death of his younger brother when Ray was boy himself. Kerry Washington and Ragina King play the two most prominent women in Ray's life, wife Della and mistress Margie Hendricks - the homemaker and the artist. One survives the turmoil of Ray's life and the other commits suicide; that juxtaposition alone allows one to see the duality of Ray Charles. The movie sees it, too, in a sobering kind of way, without the joy that accompanied many of Ray's best musical work.</p></body></html>

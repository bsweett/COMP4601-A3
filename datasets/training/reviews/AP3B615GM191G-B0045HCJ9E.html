<meta name="summary" content="A Well-Constructed Spy Romp"></head><body><p>When it comes to Alfred Hitchcock pictures, his "MacGuffin" plot style is quite a bit overused (especially by today's standards).  "North By Northwest" contains that same style of film-making.  However, this film is so well-constructed otherwise that it still holds up well over time.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "North by Northwest" follows the exploits of one Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant), who is mistaken for another man and happens to fall into a Cold War spy ring led by Phillip Vandamm (James Mason).  Along the way, Thornhill is romanced (and does a fair share of the romancing) by Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), whose character may not be exactly who she seems.<br /><br />In terms of plot, this is one of Hitchcock's best...if only for the first half of the film when the mystery of "Thornhill/Kaplan" is still brewing.  Once the truth is disclosed, however, the MacGuffin quickly becomes apparent and kind of turns the movie into a simply spy tale (and thus it loses a little luster).<br /><br />The acting is terrific, as Hitch makes the "bad guys" genuinely creepy (I mean, Martin Landau's face alone is enough to do that!) and showcases Grant & Saint throughout.<br /><br />Bernard Hermann's soundtrack also deserves a good chunk of the credit for keeping the latter portions of this movie interesting, as those famous Hermann strings refuse to let viewers relax even for a moment during the climactic moments.<br /><br />Overall, "North by Northwest" is a very good Hitchcock effort that deserves watching by any fan of the director or just cinema buffs in general.  A 3.5 ranking would be my exact choice, but because of it being so well-made, I bump it up to four stars.</p></body></html>

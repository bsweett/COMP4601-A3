That isn't always a guarantee of a good film but "The Queen" is a reminder that often it IS.  I really didn't know what to expect but I was drawn in quickly.  Whomever decided to make a movie about the warm, loving side of QEII gets my vote for the Oscar for Best Original Idea.  This movie actually works very well and I found myself cheering for the old gal.  The rather recent history was also a big plus as I suspect most of us find ourselves being drawn back into the shocking event of Princess Di's untimely death.  I'm sure that there were plenty of people like myself who never really followed the Princess yet were drawn into the communal sadness that followed her fatal accident.  I recall the British uproar over the lack of any emotional expression from Queen Elizabeth II and, admittedly, her inaction seemed pretty cold at the time.  I actually feel better now about her and a lot of other things.  I was engrossed in the portrayal of the official yet caring relationship that the new PM Tony Blair was developing with her majesty.  I'm sure much of this is creative but the frequent use of newsreel accounts seems to draw us into a sense of complete reality.  I don't know when I last saw a movie that got me so involved with such an aloof character.  Maybe this same production crew will rejuvenate Senator John F. Kerrey next. (Substitute VP Dick Cheney if you don't see the humor in my first suggestion).</p></body></html>

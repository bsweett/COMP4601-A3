The performance of Sharlto Copley as the bureaucrat named Wikus Sharlto is pitch perfect and the entire film was well cast. Great writing and acting here folks. Wilkus is no action hero &agrave; la Tom Cruise or Bruce or take your Hollywood pic. The alien ship, technology and weapons are very convincing. The alien weapons are freakin' awesome. Seriously. As engaging as District 9 is, this ain't no non-stop action flick but when we get to shooting people and blowing stuff up, well I felt very satisfied. The aliens, referred to disdainfully as "pawns" by humans, resemble our crustaceans. They are very, well, "alien". They're physically bizarre looking and speak in a strange "clicking" language. Fortunately people can learn to understand it and the pawns can understand us. These aren't your stereotypical bad guy invader aliens or our angelic Spielberg variety. In fact one of the most interesting aspects of District 9 is the depiction of aliens as very strange creatures surely from out of this world, but at the same time very down-to-earth as well. They are animals like us and have needs (some very comical) and weaknesses and it's fascinating to see the economy developed between human and alien. Some are smarter than others. Doing the film as faux documentary was a brilliant stroke and added a helluva edge. The story mostly unfolds in filthy urban squalor. Distrcit 9 is the name of the camp the aliens are contained in. This science fiction movie is set in Johannesburg, South Africa. Not New York, L.A., Washington D.C. And the setting is crucial to what this highly entertaining sci-fi tale is really about. It's about us of course and it's about what ugly creatures we humans can be. We selfish and fearful humans with our xenophobia and racism and corrupt bureaucracies and greed trumps all morality ethos of the corporate elite and ineffective, corrupt and two-faced governments. There is personal redemption in this story, but when it's all said and done we're left wondering, what next? And I love that.<br /><br />To say some obvious things: Why District 9 is among the best films of 2009 and one of the best science fiction films of all time is because it has the qualities that great films posses. These of course include great direction, excellent script and original story telling, interesting setting, terrific acting, thought provoking social/political commentary, visually striking and highly imaginative sets and effects, good dramatic tension, etc...<br /><br />This movie deserves to be appreciated more and I predict it will be appreciated more in the long-term like so many classic films the public was a tad slow with.</p></body></html>

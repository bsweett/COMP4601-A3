<meta name="summary" content="Fun "Pop Corn" Flick"></head><body><p>Eagle Eye stars Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan as two people who have been "activated" after they answer their cell phones.<br /><br />The person on the other end of the call gives them detailed instructions to follow. If they fail to obey, people will die. (People die because they obey but what can you do?)<br /><br />Billy Bob Thornton stars as the FBI agent in charge of the manhunt for the two suspected terrorists.<br /><br />What would you do if there was someone watching you at all times? If they had complete control of your cell phone, other's cell phones, pretty much any mechanical device...<br /><br />These two are thrown together to play their own parts in a master plan of assassination.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg acts as executive producer so you know this film will be sharp. There's something about all the films he's involved in that you can be confident they will be solid.<br /><br />Eagle Eye is a fun Summer pop corn flick.</p></body></html>

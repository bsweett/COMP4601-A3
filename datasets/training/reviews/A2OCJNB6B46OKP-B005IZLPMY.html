<meta name="summary" content="Finally Gets His Dues. (Book 1 Part 5 )"></head><body><p>Captain America, is one of the oldest comic book heroes, up there with Superman and Batman. For some reason, he never had the spotlight like those other two. In fact he was a hero that was practically crapped on with plenty of horrible representations in other various media. With the Avengers story line doing so well in the box office, Marvel finally reached the story line of this superhero, and I am glad to say that Captain America has finally witnessed justice.<br /><br />`Captain America: The First Avenger' is, in fact a prequel to all the other films we have seen until now. It is the story that takes place during World War Two, and the creation of a soldier that was able to take the enemy down. The job was not given to the strongest, or the brashest of men. In fact it was given to a man who was as imperfect as you can get, but his eagerness to put others in front of himself and his want to right wrongs, gave this man the chance to be something great. With that, Captain America was born.<br /><br />This film was so enjoyable, the cast was very well put together. While I was curious about Chris Evans playing this specific hero, I was impressed. The rest of the cast including Hugo Weaving and Tommy Lee Jones were well placed and fun to watch. What I was happy about the most was the tribute that this film played to Captain America's history in comics, with a lot of references that are scattered throughout the film. To me, this may have been the most accurate depiction of a super hero, even giving Christopher Nolan's Batman a run for its money on accuracy.<br /><br />This is a movie you will like, even if you have never seen any of the other Marvel Studio films, it is a simple, yet complex story and loads of fun.</p></body></html>

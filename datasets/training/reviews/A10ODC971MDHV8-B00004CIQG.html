<meta name="summary" content="Dr. Strangelove"></head><body><p>The most inspired piece of Cold War satire ever and one of the screen's supreme black comedies, Kubrick's 1964 "Strangelove" confronted jittery audiences in the aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis, and not long after the advent of the H bomb.

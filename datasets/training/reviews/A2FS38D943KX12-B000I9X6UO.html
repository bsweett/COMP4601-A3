<meta name="summary" content="Adequate --- but could have been pretty good"></head><body><p>This is one those films that really frustrates me.  It starts off with a pretty compelling idea that could have resulted in a extraordinarily tension-filled movie.  In fact there were points in the movie where the tension level is considerable, where everything clicked perfectly.  Unfortunately, there are ultimately more hits than misses when all is said & done --- one is left unsatisfied with a movie that simply didn't live up to its potential.<br /><br />Just what was it about killers such as the Beltway Sniper that left people feeling so unsettled?  Simply put, it was the shere randomness of the killings --- the fact that one moment you could be some anonymous schlub filling his tank at a gas station, and the next moment you could be a corpse with a bullet in his or her brain.  Is it plausible that nut job with a gun could pick you out at random while you were making a phone call from a phone booth?  You better believe it is.  Is it plausible that he knows somehow has the means to know your entire personal history & is producing a miniature morality play just to teach you a lesson?  Not exactly.  Once the deed loses its random nature, it becomes much less compelling & simply seems contrived.<br /><br />On the other hand, the movie is quite brief --- a full two hours of this would have had me turning off the TV from boredom.  Everyone involved in the production process is to be commended for understanding the dangers of dragging out a storyline to point where it cannot be sustained.<br /><br />When all is said & done, you could do much worse with your viewing choices, but just think about how truly thrilling this movie could have been if the right choices had been made with the storyline.</p></body></html>

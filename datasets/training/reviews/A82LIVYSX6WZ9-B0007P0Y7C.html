<meta name="summary" content="Jennifer Garner returns as Elektra"></head><body><p>Jennifer Garner (Catch Me If you Can, Alias) returns as that sexy clad knife swirling Elektra we loved in that stinky DareDevil movie with tht Ben Affleck guy. Elektra returns, back from the dead and kicking major (...) in a movie directed by Rob Bowman (The X-Files movie, Reign Of Fire) The Hand is a evil society waging a war on the good people to find the treasure, which is a young girl with powers they want to bring to their team, but Elektra wont let that happen as she highkicks it into overdrive and goes on a karate chopping adventure. The badguys consist of a whiterobed/faster then lightning guy who years ago when Elektra was little killed her mother. There's a woman who you dont wanna make out with, a big buff black guy that cant be penetrated and a tatoo freak in which animals come out of his body. Elektra kicks ass and doesnt take names as she goes on fighting these baddies to bring peace and save the little girl. Some good action set pieces spark this sometimes corny plotted movie but its a notch higher then DareDevil at least thats in my mind. Jennifer Garner is smoking!! Also starring Terence Stamp (The Limey, Poor Cow), Gorn Visnjic (E.R., Close Your Eyes) and Jason Isaacs (The Patriot, Event Horizon). For diehard Garner fans.</p></body></html>

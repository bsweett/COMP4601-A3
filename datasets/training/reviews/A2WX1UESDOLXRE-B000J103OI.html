Because I live in the Midwest, this isn't exactly a world that I'm exposed to, and it's a blast joining this fashion frenzied crowd for a few hundred pages. The same can be said of the movie. It's fun while it lasts. And what makes it so much fun is, duh, Meryl Streep. No one can stop talking about how excellent she is in this, even Anne Hathaway admits that Meryl steals the show. And she does. She's a sharp-tongued, fashionista, editor bitch, whose claws are permanently out and scratching at the eyes of her assitants and, well, anyone else around her that doesn't do exactly what she wants exactly the way she says.<br /><br />Hathaway plays Andrea, a bright-eyed college grad, who wants nothing more than to be a writer in NYC. How grand! She can't seem to get a writing job, but manages to snatch the job "a million girls would kill for"-- being the assitant to the demanding Miranda Priestly (Streep), editor of the hot and hip magazine called Runway. Andrea doesn't fit into this world of couture and makeup, a world where the new size 4 is a size 2, and size 6 (Andrea's size) is the new 14. Ouch. But Andrea is determined to stick it out, going so far as to alienate her boyfriend Nate (Adrien Grenier), her friends, her family, and herself, all so she can get her dream job-- because as everyone knows, one year serving Miranda means that she can hook you up with a job. ANYWHERE YOU WANT.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway is, as always, a likable personality. What little we see of Grenier is pleasing, if for the simple fact that he's so adorably messy and cute. Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci (as the cliche gay guy who helps the clueless girl, though Tucci OWNS this role) are the show stealers. And I can't not mention Simon Baker. Just because he's hot. Oh, and his character does manage to be effective in the few minutes they give him on screen. Great soundtrack, cute story, biting wit-- what more can a girl ask for?? Hm... maybe the new Marc Jacobs bag??</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Proof"></head><body><p>'Proof' is from the director of 'Shakespeare in Love' and stars<br /><br />Academy Award Winners Gwyneth Paltrow (Best Actress, 'Shakespeare in Love') and Anthony Hopkins (Best Actor, 'The Silence of the Lambs');<br /><br />As well as Academy Award Nominee Jake Gylenhaal (Best Supporting Actor, 'Brokeback Mountain') and Hope Davis. 'Proof' tells the story<br /><br />of Catherine (Paltrow) a young woman taking care of her brilliant father<br /><br />Robert (Hopkins). Well, Robert was brilliant. He used to be a famed mathemetician who made an incredible breakthrough in his twenties. Now he's crazy and just writes nonsense in a never ending series of notebooks. But then Robert dies and a former student of his, Hal (Gyllenhaal) volunteers to go through all the notebooks. Meanwhile, Catherine's sister Claire shows up and claims that Catherine's sanity is slipping...And maybe it is. Well, anyway, there you have my synopsis of the movie. I do recommend the movie, it's entertaining and interesting. All the actors are great, especially Hopkins who's not even in the film that much. The movie was adapted from a play and in most cases (unless you're Tyler Perry) movies transition well from plays. Well, hope you like it.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></body></html>

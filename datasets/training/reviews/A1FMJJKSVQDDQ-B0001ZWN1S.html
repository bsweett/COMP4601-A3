While I do admire Orson Welles, I don't necessarily count Citizen Kane as my top favorite classic. Not even Lawrence of Arabia or Schindler's List or It's a Wonderful Life (despite being spectacular masterpieces in their own right) are at the top of my own list. So which film IS at the top? Well, take a look at the DVD cover on this Amazon page, and it should be very obvious . . .<br /><br />This is Francis Ford Coppola's greatest work of art, and without a doubt one of the finest motion pictures to ever be released. It may be overrated by some, but to me, this is the one that will last a lifetime. I won't go into full detail of the plot, but I will tell you that the concept of mobsters being psychologically complex is particulary stunning (not only because it was highly unusual at the time, but because it makes everything in the film so unique). Scarface and Goodfellas had it good also, but this is the original that you "can't refuse".<br /><br />However, those who have not yet seen this film and are expecting some typical Hollywood action and adventure will be highly disappointed. This is a drama film, but a brilliant drama film. The tension between characters, the atmosphere in every interior settings, the dialogue, the music, and the heavily brutal violence are almost perfect from beginning to end. The acting in this film is also extraordinary. Brando, Pacino, Duvall, Caan, Keaton, Vigoda, Lettieri, and Castellano give flawless performances. They're believable in their roles, and they never overact.<br /><br />It's almost hard to believe that this was filmed with a low budget, but Coppola and his crew were able to pull it all off. Alongside The Godfather Part II, these extraordinarily iconic films will never accept extinction, and we fans will make sure that it never does.<br /><br />Grade: A+</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not "The Godfather" But Damn Good"></head><body><p>The first thing you see when you go to buy The Good Shepherd is that it's being hailed as "The Godfather of CIA Movies."  Big boast, right?  Does it step up to the level of The Godfather as a classic movie?  Robert DeNiro directs and stars, Matt Damon, Angelin Jolie, Alec Baldwin, William Hurt and the list of supportng castmates goes on.  At two hours and forty-eight minutes it's definitely got epic written all over it.  Well...<br /><br />I look at good long movies like this: if I start to squirm in my seat, it's too long for it's own good.  If I don't even notice the extended length, it's a damn good.<br /><br />I squirmed.<br />Sorry.<br /><br />The Good Shepherd is the story of Edward Wilson, a Yale graduate and all around good guy who happens to belong the the Skull & Bones Society. Neat little upper class cult that it is,  like Frat Boys meets The Illuminati.  Creepy.  Edward witnessed his father's suicide at the age of six and actualy stole the suicide note before anyone got there.  He confesses this while lying naked in a sarcophigi surrounded by his hooded, black-cloaked Skull & Bones brethren. Okay...  Hitler is rising in Europe and even though America is still firmly out of the conflict, the OSS decides it's time to start doing things to keep the U.S. in the game without being directly involved.  The CIA is born.  Counterintelligence.  Spies.  Networks.  The whole nine yards and Edward Wilson is right there from the beginning, traveling to Europe for six years, leaving behid a wife (Jolie) he barely knows and a son yet-to-be-born.<br /><br />The human side of The Good Shepherd is interesting.  Edward fel in love with a deaf girl named Laura and had planned to be with her always, but during a little Skull & Bones reunion, he is taken into the woods by a Senator' daughter and seduced.  She gets pregnant.  He marries her.  So long Laura.  Damn.  We see the rise and fall of Edward Wilson not only as a spy, a counterintelligence agent for the newly spawned CIA, but as a human being.  His morales are tested. His allegiance, too.  His trust in others is absolutely extinguished.  He winds up having hs son's pegnant fiance thrown from an airplane on her way to their wedding because she was working for the KGB.  Nice.<br /><br />Overall, The Good Shepherd is a good movie sharing time between the year leading up to WWII and the faled CIA-sponsored rebellion against Cuba's Castro at the beginning of The Cold War.  De Niro directs masterfully and the cast is well-rounded.  But...I still squirmed and that means that something was lacking.  When you bring up a movie like The Godfather and then compare it, no matter how casually, there is bound to be problems. The Good Shepherd had too many slow spots where a good editing by De Niro might have made it better.  Still a good movie.  I would definitely watch it again, but not too soon.  It may take a while to digest it, perhaps nurtue a fondness for it. Could you spend your money more wisely?  Maybe.  But there aren't too many flick coimng out of this caliber, however, so make your choice.  You should not be too disappointed.<br /><br />Dig it.</p></body></html>

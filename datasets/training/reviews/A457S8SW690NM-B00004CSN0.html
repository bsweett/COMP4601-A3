<meta name="summary" content="Al Pacino + Robert De Niro= Awesome movie! (4 1/2 stars)"></head><body><p>Heat is a masterpiece starring Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, and Tom Sizemore. Al Pacino is a cop trying to nail De Niro and his gang of robbers who are robbing banks. Pacino and De Niro are absolutely brilliant with two powerhouse performances. It's a rare thing to see actors this good in 1 movie. That alone makes it worth watching but the movie itself is a classic. It has one of the best scenes of all time in which a bank robbery turns into an amazing shootout. Bullets fly everywhere and lots of cops die in this classic scene. The movie is very long actually but even though it seems very long at times, 90% of it flew by for me. The ending is good but what you will remember is that awesome shootout!<br /><br />I'm giving it 4 1/2 stars because of its length!</p></body></html>

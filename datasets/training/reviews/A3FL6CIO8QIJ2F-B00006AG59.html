Starring hunk Brenden Fraser, the story deals with the resurrection of mummy, Imhotep, and his destruction on those he encounters, as well as the  powerful Scorpion King, played with great villany by former wrestler The Rock.  Rick (Brenden Fraser) is now married and it's up to him and his wife to save their son from these forces of evil. The DVD comes with a ton of bonuses including interviews, commentary, trailers, outtakes, video, and much more. "The Mummy Returns" was followed by "The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor".</p></body></html>

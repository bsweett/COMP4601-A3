Brilliant, demential, cynical, dynamical, perfect, ironical with a dazzling script, excellent camara direction and a superb cast.<br />If not for Kind hearts and cornets (1950) this would be the greatest black comedy ever made.<br />Kubrick broke all the previous forecast and established this film like an authentical landmark.<br />Sellers in his best triple performance.  George C Scott and Sterling Hyden are really amazing.<br />A MASTERPIECE.<br />What are you waiting for acquiring it?<br />Mein f&uuml;hrer I can walk!</p></body></html>

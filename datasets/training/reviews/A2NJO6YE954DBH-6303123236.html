<meta name="summary" content="The Classic Disney film in a DVD Edition for the Ages"></head><body><p>It is clear from the DVD edition that Disney has put together for &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,&quot; the beloved film enshrined in cinema history as the first full-length animated film, that this is the standard by which all future Disney releases will be judged.  Your kids or grandchildren might find the animation to be somewhat quaint, but they will certainly be impressed by this &quot;Immersive 2-Disc DVD Experience.&quot;  There is so much to do with the extras that they might even forget to actually watch the movie, which has been digitally restored.  However, this would be a big mistake as you are not going to be able to solve the puzzles and win &quot;Dopey's Wild Mine Ride&quot; game if you have not seen the film.<p>Everything is hosted by either Roy Disney or the Magic Mirror on the Wall (you have to love that that dry sense of humor), and what they have on the first disc along with the movie is enough to thrill any fan of Snow White.  You can listen to Barbra Streisand sing &quot;Some Day My Prince Will Come&quot; or you can all sing the Karaoke version of &quot;Heigh-Ho.&quot;  Then there is &quot;The Making of 'Snow White'&quot; documentary, the aduio commentary and even the Silly Symphony cartoon &quot;Goddess of Spring.&quot;  And all of this is before you even get to the second disc where you are simply going to find what must be EVERYTHING Disney has relating to this film as we explore &quot;The Legacy of 'Snow White.'&quot;  There are not just deleted scenes and a deleted song (&quot;You're Never Too Old To Be Young&quot;), there are abandoned concepts for several scenes, such as a &quot;fantasy version&quot; of &quot;Some Day My Prince Will Come.&quot;  Just look at the Edition Details for this DVD: have you ever seen a list that long?  It took me the entire weekend just to get through MOST of what is on this DVD.  <p>Yes, you bought the Disney animated films on videotape and then you went out and got them on DVD.  But the extras alone are worth the price of this first &quot;Platinum Edition.&quot;  Most importantly, Disney has clearly made a covenant with its audience that this is indeed the level of excellence they will do with their entire collection of classic films and I only hope they do this not just for &quot;Pinocchio&quot; but also for &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; as well.  This is what happens when a studio cherishes its classic films as much as we do.</p></body></html>

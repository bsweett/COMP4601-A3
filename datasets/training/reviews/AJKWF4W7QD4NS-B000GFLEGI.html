But now, with the recent success of more mainstream aimed zombie flicks like 28 Days Later, the Resident Evil films, the excellent spoof Shaun of the Dead, and even the big budget remake of Romero's own Dawn of the Dead, the climate has never been better for the zombie horror master to show us all how a zombie movie is really done.  For the most part, Land of the Dead is a thoroughly enjoyable horror romp that despite it's R rating, still provides the gut ripping gore that Romero fans would come to expect.  The story involves a team of mercenaries led by Riley (Simon Baker), who are employed by a millionaire socialite (Dennis Hopper) in this post-apocalyptic zombie wasteland where the remaining humans are barricaded from the hordes of hungry undead outside.  However, the zombies seem to be communicating and learning on a primative level, and are led by the hulking "Big Daddy" (Eugene Clark).  Things get even more complicated when the rightfully disatisfied, and ever politically uncorrect named, Cholo (John Leguizamo) ransoms the tank like vehicle "Dead Reckoning" (which was Romero's original title of the film) as the zombies close in for the kill.  While there had to be cuts in order for Land of the Dead to sustain it's R rating, there is still plenty of gruesome deaths and excellently designed makeup, courtesy of Greg Nicotero and co.  The cast does solid work, led by Baker, Leguizamo, and Hopper, along with Robert Joy as Riley's dim witted but faithful follower, and Asia Argento as a sometimes hooker who joins up with Riley's crew.  What hurts Land of the Dead the most is that Romero goes for the "cheap scare" routine more here than he ever did before in any of his other films.  Not to mention that there are a nice amount of plot holes, and the lack of character development (something which helped make the original Dawn of the Dead such a masterpiece) is quite lacking.  In the end though, Land of the Dead is pretty much everything that a Romero fan could hope for, and with cameos from Nicotero, FX legend Tom Savini, and Shaun of the Dead star Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright, this is a horror fan's delight.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Dramatic Ups & Downs, But Overall Entertaining"></head><body><p>Man, the first hour of this film was riveting and thought to myself, "Why did this movie get so many poor reviews? I think it's great. It has drama, humor, suspense, fun characters, decent fantasy, horror....you name it. This is a real sleeper of a film."<br /><br />Paul Giamatti is really as the hotel manager "Cleveland Heep" and Bryce Dallas Howard is believable, if you will, as "Story, the "sea nymph." As long as those two dominated the screen, the movie was great.<br /><br />Then - wham! - just like that, it got stupid. All of sudden, half of the motel residents - even though some of them are a hoot - got involved with the two main characters and it became ridiculous. They all assemble with this "sea nymph" bedtime story character and start playing all these ridiculous roles as "The Interpeter," "The Guild," "The Healer," etc.<br /><br />The movie seems to go from an intimate suspense-fantasy to a grab-bag of crazy New Age weirdness. Within five minutes, I almost lost all interest to keep going.However, I'm glad I did because it settled down when this group-effort doesn't do the trick and things gt interesting, once again.<br /><br />All in all, I just took as a pure fictional fantasy Tinker Bell-type tale and let it go at that. I think this is one of the those films that could easily be over-analyzed and overly interpreted with all kinds of analogies and metaphors. I would just look at it as entertainment, and nothing else. On that level, it succeeds. It's weird......but it surely entertains.</p></body></html>

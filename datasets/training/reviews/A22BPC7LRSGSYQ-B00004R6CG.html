<meta name="summary" content="Hitchcock masterpiece has been restored"></head><body><p>So much has been said already about this masterpiece that I won't go into describing the plot, etc.  Read other reviews for that.  I just want to give a few thoughts on this movie...<br /><br />What else can be said about Vertigo (1958), except that's it's a masterpiece in Alfred Hitchcock's collection.  That sums it up.  This classic stars James Stewart, Kim Novak, Barbara Bel Geddes (of "Dallas" fame), Tom Helmore, Henry Jones, Raymond Bailey, and Ellen Corby (of "The Waltons" fame).<br /><br />This movie's setting is in San Francisco.  It's the perfect setting and atmosphere for a movie like this.  The bay, the hills, the streets, etc. make San Francisco ideal for this movie of obsession and mystery.<br /><br />One thing that makes me laugh is the scene in Scottie's dwelling after Scottie rescues "Madeleine" from San Francisco Bay. In this scene, "Madeleine" wakes up and asks where she is, as she doesn't seem to remember what happened (jumping into San Francisco Bay).  Her wet clothes are hanging up in another room, which means that Scottie had to have removed her clothes while she was sleeping.  I think it's funny, even though "Madeleine" does realize at one point that Scottie had to have removed her clothes and she doesn't seem too embarrassed by it.<br /><br />This movie has been restored because it's a classic.  Even though the film still shows signs of wear and tear, the picture quality has been greatly enhanced.  The colors are fantastic.  The sound is great.  I've read reviews where some people are complaining about the music being tinkered with (too loud) and some sound effects being thrown in that were not in the original film, or sound effects being replaced with new sound effects.  This stuff doesn't bother me.  It's still a great film to watch.<br /><br />The musical score by Bernard Herrmann is fantastic and really fits the movie well.  It is one of the great movie scores of all time.  The opening credit sequence is classic.<br /><br />One of the extras on this DVD is about how the film was restored, narrated by Roddy McDowall. It was restored by Robert A. Harris and James C. Katz. There is also commentary from associate producer Herbert Coleman, along with comments from Kim Novak and Barbara Bel Geddes.<br /><br />The original game plan for Hitchcock was to make Vera Miles into a star by having her play Madeleine, but she got pregnant and had to cancel out. Kim Novak was her replacement. I don't think either actress would have done better than the other.<br /><br />This movie didn't get great reviews when it was released in 1958. Now it's considered one of the greatest movies ever made. It's funny what time does to the status of a lot of things.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie. It is considered Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece, and he made tons of films.</p></body></html>

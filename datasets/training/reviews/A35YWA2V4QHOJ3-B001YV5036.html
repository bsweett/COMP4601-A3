Films like this and THEY SHOOT HORSES DON'T THEY? make me glad I was not around in the 1930s and 1940s.  This is a true story, and one that is very inspiring indeed.<br /><br />Long before Sylvester Stallone created the character of Rocky Balboa, there was a man named James Braddock.  He was a down-on-his-luck fighter who was trying to simply make it through the Great Depression.  Most sports films center around an athlete who is driven by the desire to be the best at his / her craft.  James Braddock had a far more modest and pragmatic objective:  he simply wanted to support his family through one of the darkest chapters in U.S. history.<br /><br />The epoch in which the movie takes place makes it somewhat unique in the history of pugilism.  The 1920s and 1930s were the hayday of boxing, when it was the biggest game in town.  These days, of course, the lack of media attention, silly politics of the sport and the petulant (and sometimes bizarre) behavior of boxers has all led to an overall feeling of apathy.  In the 1930s big fights were big news.  Today, big fights barely warrant a clip on CNN.<br /><br />The film stars Russell Crowe and Renee Zelwegger.  They both do outstanding jobs.  Director Ron Howard has delivered another winner.  It's good that someone had the idea to tell the story of a man who lived in what is (for the most part) a forgotten time to most of us.<br /><br />James Braddock gets the chance of a lifetime against world heavyweight champion Max Baer due to some rather unlikely circumstances.  However, this is not just another David vs. Goliath boxing movie.  In many ways Braddock was a metaphor for people wanting to believe they could rebound from the depths of despair caused by the Great Depression.<br /><br /> Herbert Hoover was the most ineffective U.S. President up until the time of George W. Bush.  This film does a good job of detailing the drastic consequences of having a President who is in over his / her head.  However, in the darkest of times is when we need our heroes the most, and Braddock helped to inspire a great many denizens of the 30s.  He was, after all, the Cinderella Man.</p></body></html>

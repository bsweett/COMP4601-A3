<meta name="summary" content="Dogs may lead you to your lethal fate"></head><body><p>This film is fascinating and does not need a long commentary, though a decent review has to deal with a certain number of problems the film evokes and even invokes.<br /><br />The first element of note is the brunt and even brutish description of criminal violence in New York City. You have to shoot first, kill the shopkeeper as soon as you enter the corner store, then take the money without even checking if there is anyone around and then run. Killing is always the first step of that crime. Stealing is second and cleaning up is even farther down the road to hell. Who cares anyway since most of these criminals are still running, no matter whether they have been "introduced" to a judge and a court or not.<br /><br />The police has no power whatsoever when confronted to these thugs. The vigilante reflex is then one possible reaction from the public, passive most of the time but one out of a million makes about 15 ready to draw their guns and start shooting at them. Shooting them dead of course.<br /><br />The second problem is the point of view from which this film is seen, that of the victim of some violence of that type who has managed to survive by sheer luck. She wants to get out of this past but this past will never be bygone, so it has to be expurgated, purged, flushed away and the homeopathic method, since the standard police doctor is out, is the best way to extinguish the pain.<br /><br />The rest is the final twist. You will not be able to foresee the end even if you know the victim at stake here is a radio show anchorwoman. Radio people often have a strange imagination because they are used to being invisible since they are only a voice.<br /><br />Enjoy the ending, and the in-between details. A good film altogether and the vision of Central Park is slightly less conventional than usual.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></body></html>

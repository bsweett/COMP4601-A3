The first movie was quite clever and the game and puzzles made sense. I even told friends and family it wasn't that gory, and it really wasn't. It was a true thriller. This movie on the other hand was more like all the other gorefest schlock. Afterall we start with not two people playing the game but no less than eight. Okay to get the ball rolling we first got to see a snitch have his head spiked by a mask before we find our group of victims in their cell.  Then right off without any delay or game drama we get to see one shot in the eye and his brains blown out. Not much longer we see another get burned up.<br /><br />All-in-all a bit of a disappointment from the first movie. Granted I never expected it to be as good as the first one, I just hoped it would follow the line of suspense over gore. It didn't. It joined the countless number of hack and slash movies with little story and lots of blood. Oh golly we get to see "Jigsaw" pass the sawblade to another. Such a thrill. NOT! Why did I give it three stars? It still has reasonably good acting, and some semblance of a story. So if you can stomach substancially more gore than the first movie, by all means rent it. I don't recommend this one for a purchase unless you are heavy into slasher movies. If you want a bit of gore with a little more story and suspense, try "Mindhunters" or "Hannibal Rising".</p></body></html>

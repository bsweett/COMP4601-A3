It's 100 minutes of discomfort and unintentional laughs.<br /><br />The "true" background of this story was fodder enough for two films 25 year ago: In 1975, Bob and Kathy Lutz (Reynolds and Melissa George) moved into the Long Island mini-mansion where, a year before, Robbie "Butch" DiFeo murdered his family. The Lutzes knew the history just before they bought the house; 28 days later, they fled it, left all their possessions and co-wrote a book about their experiences.<br /><br />There's been enough debate over whether Lutzes were telling the truth or concocting a hoax for money. Nevertheless, what the family "claimed" happened was far more subtle and interesting than this movie, which opens wide the horror encyclopedia, plucks a few entries and smears them on the screen whether they make sense or not.<br /><br />Consider: When the buxom, foul-mouthed babysitter - never had one of those in a scary flick - has to be hauled away in a straitjacket on the fourth or fifth day, why is the family curiously isolated afterward? No media, no paranormalists, no cops. Or how about when the Lutzes' 10-year-old daughter is lured out to the ledge of roof by a ghost? Do you stick in the house no matter how insistent the father? Is the local priest really useful at that point? "The Amityville Horror" is straddled between being restrained and a Rob Zombie picture, which is to say it's shameless, trading on its tie-in to a "true story" while it peddles demonic nonsense.<br /><br />Reynolds tackles Bob Lutz with relish, transforming into a frothing wild man. The performance is cartoonish - he's ridiculously buff, practically harlequin - and geared toward the Jack Nicholson wig-out in "The Shining. But Reynolds, a comic actor attempting to cross the drama bridge, is rabid, seething. Melissa George is just another panicky, freckled-face blonde, and the three kids are not memorable enough to mention the actors who played them. George C. Scott is dead now, so Philip Baker Hall plays the senile, befuddled priest. Someone will inevitably say on the DVD commentary what an honor it was to have Philip Baker Hall on set for a whole day.<br /><br />"The Amityville Horror" gets more absurd when we learn the source of the evil, involving Indian burial grounds, some old male witch,  torture chambers and torrents of bloods raining down on Reynolds. It's disgusting, not frightening. But a lot of horror movies confuse the two.</p></body></html>

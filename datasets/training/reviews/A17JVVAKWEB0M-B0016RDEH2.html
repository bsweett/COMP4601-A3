<meta name="summary" content="2006's Best Film"></head><body><p>In post Civil War Spain, eleven year old Ofelia travels into the mountains with her pregnant and severely ill mother, as they join her new stepfather, a torturous Fascist Military Captain whose assignment is to decimate fledgling bands of Communist guerillas.  With the brutality of war all around her and a mother who seems destined to not survive her pregnancy, Ofelia's escape from the horrors of the world are in her collection of fairy tales, including one that seems to come alive in an ancient labyrinth.<br /><br />In one of Ofelia's books, she learns of Princess Moanna, the daughter of an underworld King, who is believed to live in the mortal world, but will someday return to rule alongside her father.  One night in the labyrinth, Ofelia meets a faun who tells her she is the lost Princess and will be able to return home if she completes three tasks.  I say she "meets" a faun, others may say she "imagines" meeting a faun.  The film is open to interpretation, as those who believe in fairy tales see the entire action of the film as true, while others see her supernatural adventures as a young child's imaginative way of dealing with war and death.<br /><br />Ofelia's quest to complete the faun's tasks makes up much of the plot of Guillermo del Toro's masterpiece Pan's Labyrinth.  Almost oblivious to the war around her, Ofelia battles giant toads and child-eating monsters, scenes presented in brilliant colors that juxtapose the dark bluish-grey scenes of war.  Countering her story is the Captain's brutal dictatorship over the mountain, as he kills without cause and tortures to both get answers and satisfy urges within.  Although a film advertised as a "fairy tale", the true-to-life violence in the Captain's scenes rivals anything released since The Passion of the Christ.  Del Toro unapologetically displays the real consequences of meeting flesh to a blade or the butt of a gun.<br /><br />That the director doesn't distinguish between his two stories, that he doesn't favor one over the other is the magic of Pan's Labyrinth.  Viewers who believe are just as convinced as to the existence of the fawn as they are of the guerillas.  And to those of us who have never known war, we can relate just as much to the enchantment of Ofelia's dreams as we can to the barbarity of Spain's nightmare.</p></body></html>

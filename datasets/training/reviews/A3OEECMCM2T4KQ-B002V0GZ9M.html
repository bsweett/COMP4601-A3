<meta name="summary" content="A Surprisingly Moving Love Story"></head><body><p>The Lake House is a touching, moving and original story about `star-crossed-lovers', two strangers caught in an unexplained time rift, forced to communicate to each other only by written letters, whose relationship soon develops into true love, obsession and a battle against `fate'.<br /><br />The notion of changing historical events through time anomalies and accomplishing those changes has been explored in literature and film for many years.<br /><br />One of the most famous and currently almost forgotten tales of time-travel-love is H.G. Wells' The Time Machine. The entire purpose of the protagonist in the novel is to travel back in time to prevent the accidental death of his one and true love. Once creating his time machine, he travels back to the moment of his beloved's death only to come against `fate'; she was meant to die, and no matter what he does, the girl comes to her death despite the inventor's best efforts...fighting fate will always be a losing battle.<br /><br />In The lake House, this particular theme is a little less dramatic, however, is a modern love story about loneliness, falling in love with someone you have never actually met, the utter persistence of those in love to meet and finally be with them and the view that love, in its purest form, will overcome anything, including opposition, distance, and the passage of time.<br /><br />Reeves and Bullock, though not sharing many scenes together, (mostly the dialogue between them in the form of their letters) managed to convey a certain emotional realism.<br /><br />In this film at least, Reeves appears to have matured as an actor: there is nothing forced or uncomfortable about this performance, he has grown in the craft and truly carried the character with believability and apparent ease.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock has shown time and time again that she is an "all rounder" in the profession. Her comedic roles are funny, sometimes hilarious, and her `serious' roles can and do stand up against the best actresses currently in vogue in Hollywood. There is an undefinable charm about Sandra Bullock, which, really, came through loud and clear in this film.<br /><br />The Lake House is entertaining for a `romance', as it places love against unusual circumstances, written, directed and edited with a simple idea in mind, and executed with skill and vision.<br /><br />4.5 stars.</p></body></html>

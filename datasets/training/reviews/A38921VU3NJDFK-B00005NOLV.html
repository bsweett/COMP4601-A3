<meta name="summary" content="Planet of the Apes (1968)"></head><body><p>Adapted from Pierre Boulle's 1963 French novel, director Franklin Schaffner's Planet of the Apes stars Charlton Heston as a "spaceman" named Taylor, who, along with two other astronauts, finds himself on a mysterious planet run by intellectual apes. After eventually escaping the confines of the apes' prison, which still holds one of his earthly companions captive (the other is the local museum's latest addition), he ventures out into the planet's uncharted parts, where he makes a dire discovery that will make your stomach churn.<br /><br />Planet of the Apes is a time-standing masterpiece of sociological complexities that gleams with on-screen beauty, lavish sets, brilliant costumes (which garnered an Oscar nod in '69), and enough action to appease a popcorn-movie hound. It is considered a vital piece of the sci-fi movement and preceded four sequels and a remake in 2001, none of which compares to its ingenuity. Still, none of the aforementioned qualities amount to its mind-blowing conclusion, one of the most eerie endings in film history.</p></body></html>

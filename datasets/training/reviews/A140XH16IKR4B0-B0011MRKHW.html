She is held in fearful esteem by her people, whom she swears to protect. But treachery is afoot, in the lingering presence of Catholics in England after the Reformation, and Elizabeth worries about the intentions of her captive cousin, the Catholic Mary Queen of Scots. Meanwhile, Elizabeth plays a teasing game with suitors from around Europe, each hoping to make her his queen. Enter the dashing and roguish Walter Raleigh (Clive Owen) fresh from his discovery of Virginia, named for his beloved virgin queen. Raleigh charms his way into Elizabeth's court, and encounters a monarch who is vulnerable in spite of her adamantine exterior. All of this plays out against the threat from Spanish King Philip, busy building a fleet of ships to recapture England for the Church and to depose the "illegitimate" Elizabeth.<br /><br />As I said, the first half of the film was wonderful -- well-written, clever, visually stunning. The costumes were gorgeous, intricate and convincing. The acting was subtle and believable. It was touching to see Elizabeth grappling with husbandless middle age. But close to the halfway mark, the film founders and never recovers. Inexplicably, Raleigh (who heretofore had the hots for the queen herself) falls for one of her courtesans. This injects a silly "forbidden love" element into the film. After this, the movie ricochets from one movie clich&eacute; to another. Elizabeth, uncovering a plot by her cousin to take the throne, is disconsolate at the thought of executing a God-appointed queen. This in spite of her father's unstated lack of scruples in beheading E's mother, Anne Boleyn. Philip sets Jesuit plots into spin and launches the Spanish Armada against England. With odds overwhelmingly favoring Spain, will Elizabeth let her darling Raleigh out of prison to take on the Spanish? Will she regain the composure needed to lead her besieged people to victory? Will the manly Raleigh manage to get off his burning ship on time? By the time the movie ended, I really did not care. I no longer believed the character's motivations and lost hope that the movie's loose threads (OK, was E OK with Catholics or bent on hunting them down?) would be tidied up. Having abandoned any hope that the filmmakers would be able to dramatize the panoply of events, the film settles for set pieces. Elizabeth is seen in her flowing nightie, gazing out to sea at the burning enemy ships -- which are clearly visible one moment and enshrouded by fierce storms the next. Symbolic scenes (e.g., the one in which E, perfectly-coiffed and costumed, is circled dizzyingly by the camera) alternate confusingly with literal scenes full of extras. Reconciled with her status as mother of her country, she blesses the child of a couple who should have suffered her regal wrath for having ignored the need for her permission to marry.<br /><br />"Elizabeth, The Golden Age" had so much going for it. But by trying to tell so many tales at once, it managed to tell none of them well. A disappointment to all but the most ardent Blanchett and Owen fans.</p></body></html>

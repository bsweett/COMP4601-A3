Intrigued by the Cyrillic scribbling in the dead girl's diary, Anna turns to her Russian-speaking uncle, Stepan (Jerzy Skolimosky) for translation. Stepan staunchly refuses, citing his "old country" superstitions and soundly admonishing his niece for "stealing from the dead". Undaunted, Anna follows her only solid lead, a business card for a Russian restaurant that she finds in the diary. Anna soon gleans that she probably would have been better off heeding her uncle's intuitive warning, because the diary reveals itself to be a very hot potato to some extremely dangerous and scary individuals. Before she knows it, she is pulled into the brutal underworld of the local Russian Mob.<br /><br />Viggo Mortensen delivers one of his most accomplished performances to date as Nikolai, the Siberian driver for a psychotic mob captain (Vincent Cassel) who is the son of a godfather (Armin Mueller-Stahl). It is amazing to watch how effortlessly Mortensen, Cassel and Mueller-Stahl disappear into character. These skilled actors make it easy to forget that they are in actuality American, French and German; you do not doubt for one second that you are watching native Russians, who live and die by the rules of "vory v zakone" ("thieves in law", a strict code borne from the gang culture of Russian prisons).<br /><br />Screenwriter Steven Knight revisits some of the themes he explored in "Dirty Pretty Things"; namely, how the various immigrant communities go about assimilating themselves (legally and otherwise) while still maintaining a sense of their native culture. (I think this is the aspect of the film that has some people drawing comparisons to "The Godfather"). The only quibble I had with Knight's script was a "twist" toward the end involving one of the main characters that doesn't quite gel with the rest of the narrative.<br /><br />Cronenberg, who initially built his reputation on Grand Guginol excess, has slouched toward a lean, almost poetic style in recent films that he has nearly perfected in "Eastern Promises". For the hardcore Cronenberg devotees, not to worry; the director's propensity for viscerally "shocking" images and squib-happy bloodletting is still on display, but it doesn't feel gratuitous here; these characters live in a violent and brutal world, and it's par for the course. As per usual, Cronenberg slyly infuses some twisted black humor into the mix as well. One scene in particular, involving an attempted mob hit in a steam bath, featuring a fearlessly naked Mortensen and an unblinking camera, is an instant classic.</p></body></html>

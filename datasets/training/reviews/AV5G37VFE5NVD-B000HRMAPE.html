<meta name="summary" content=""M:i:III" gets the summer blockbuster season started with a bang - actually, lots of them"></head><body><p>The MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE film series can be summed up with one sentence: style over substance.  The rather jumbled plot of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE could be ignored with little difficulty thanks to thrillmaster Brian De Palma's gripping directing, while John Woo's stylistic action scenes overran the nearly incomprehensible storyline of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE II.  The difference between those films and MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III is that there is style AND substance.<br /><br />The film opens in a fashion similar to that of Quentin Tarantino's KILL BILL, as we find that we are already quite a ways through the storyline - in fact, we're very near to the end.  We can tell by the fact that the film's primary villain, played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, has Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) in restraints and is making demands about something which we assume is very valuable.  As soon as this heart-pounding sequence concludes, we are hurled into the roughly twenty-second opening credits and then yanked back out.  We find ourselves at a pre-wedding celebration between a chipper Ethan Hunt and his fiancee, Julia (Michelle Monaghan).  Ethan has given up his life with the IMF (Impossible Mission Force) and is trying to enjoy a peaceful, action-scene-free existence.  Unfortunately for him - but luckily for us - this is not possible.  It is, ironically, impossible.  It seems that one of IMF's agents has disappeared while spying on weapons dealer Owen Davian (Hoffman).  IMF wants her back.  What man is more fit for the job than Ethan Hunt?<br /><br />The story doesn't end there, of course.  Just when things are looking good for Mr. Hunt, he finds himself in over his head, both with Davian and with the IMF itself.  Ethan's trouble with his agency is not the only recycled plot element in MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III.  This film hasn't an original bone in its body.  M:i-III's storyline is made up of countless recycled plot points from the films which preceded it.  The fact that the movie boasts nothing original storywise, yet loses little of its enjoyability, is a testament to writer/director J.J. Abrams.  As a fan of Abram's television work, I found myself occasionally expecting Ethan Hunt to don a wig and engage in some real espionage, or perhaps, in one of the film's two airborne scenes, to crash-land on an island and duel it out with a giant polar bear.  Thankfully, none of this happens.  MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III stands on its own amongst J.J. Abrams' other work; still, it can't compare to the talented Mr. Abrams' television work (then again, not a whole lot can).  Along for the ride are a few of Abram's past co-workers.  These include screenwriters Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, both of whom have written numerous episodes of ALIAS; Keri Russell, who played the title character in Abrams' series FELICITY; and composer Michael Giacchino, who is responsible for scoring both ALIAS and LOST.  Giacchino's score for M:i:III is hardly as impressive as his work on the aforementioned TV shows; Lalo Schifrin's classic theme is conspicuously absent throughout most of Giacchino's score, appearing in the opening and closing credits and briefly in the bulk of the movie.<br /><br />Despite Tom Cruise's increasingly bizarre behavior off-screen, he hasn't lost any of his charisma on-screen.  Ethan Hunt, a primarily one-dimensional character whose motivations are always made abundantly clear, suddenly becomes interesting thanks to Cruise's performance.  We cheer for Ethan we he pulls something grand off, and our hearts pound when he's in trouble.  Ving Rhames reprises his role from the previous MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE films as Hunt's teammate, Luther Strickell, working alongside Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Maggie Q.  Billy Crudup is Hunt's boss, and Laurence Fishburne is Crudup's boss.  SHAUN OF THE DEAD's Simon Pegg is a stand-out in his comic scenes as IMF's technical expert, although Pegg's total screentime is almost painfully short.  The real standout of the cast is the always-exemplary Philip Seymour Hoffman, whose performance as arms dealer Owen Davian is truly chilling.  Hoffman portrays the character as being nearly inhuman, maintaining a horrific calm whilst performing the most sadistic of acts.  Hoffman's Davian seems to be bored by just about everything; to him, torture isn't something terrible or even something that requires great skill - it's just a tool to get what he wants.  Without a doubt, Hoffman makes Davian the most wicked antagonist of the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE series.<br /><br />In many of the calm scenes, the cinematography is bland and unexciting.  The action and suspense sequences, however, are an entirely different matter.  In the action scenes, the camera leaps around and captures the event(s) from a variety of angles, each angle shown for mere moments before the next is presented.  This rapid-fire style of editing really puts us there with Ethan Hunt.  We feel the adrenaline rush that he feels.  We feel acting on impulse.  We feel ourselves reacting to the chaos surrounding us.  In the scenes of suspense, the camera focuses on a character and is rather shaky, filling us with a sense of uncertainty, putting us on the edge of our seats.  Great editing and camera work can puts the audience in the moment, and the action/suspense sequences in MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III do just that.<br /><br />Combining the high-powered style of THE BOURNE IDENTITY and THE BOURNE SUPREMACY with the over-the-top gadgetry of the recent James Bond films, MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III grabs the viewer by the neck and throws him or her into a wild and shockingly fun ride.  There's nothing truly amazing here, and when you get out of the theater you may find yourself wondering just why you thought the movie was so good.  While watching the movie, however, you just can't take your eyes off it.  J.J. Abrams has seemingly pulled off the impossible.  This MISSION, should you choose to accept it, is a lot of fun.</p></body></html>

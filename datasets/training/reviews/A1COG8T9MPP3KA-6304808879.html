<meta name="summary" content="Pinhead is a  weak horror icon"></head><body><p>This is one of those films you remember from being young and think, hmm that seemed like a cool movie. Then you see it as an adult, and wonder what was I thinking? There seems to be 2 stories going on here. The whole Pinhead and his box to hell. And the other story is a guy who escaped pinhead and needs blood from victims to be become normal again.<br /><br />The living corpse, slowly coming back to life in the dark room, was the better story. It could have been a movie without the whole Pinhead tie in. I find the Pinhead characters laughable and not the least bit scary, especially the cone-head female one who looks like that chick from Saturday Night Live. You just wanna smack her. The 2 headed monster puppet was utterly ridiculous. And the sado-masochist torture devices  are nauseatingly stupid and unnecessary.<br /><br />I wonder who greenlights these Clive Barker movies? They all seem like they were written by some 13 year old heavy metal fan who draws comic books on the side. The only Clive Barker story which even remotely entertained me was Candyman, and he ripped that off from earlier stories (bloody mary).</p></body></html>

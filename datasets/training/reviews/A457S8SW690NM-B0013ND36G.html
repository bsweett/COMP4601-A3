<meta name="summary" content="A good ending to an awesome trilogy"></head><body><p>Well, this movie obviously isn't as good as the first two but it's still a pretty good movie. I mean, without James Cameron, it obviously couldn't be as good as it should have.<br /><br />The movie has basically the same plot as the others with one person sent from the future to protect someone and one person sent from the future to kill that person. In this one, Arnold is sent from the future to protect Kate, the would be wife of John Connor. But he must protect both of them but can only take orders from Kate. In the meantime, the female TX is sent back to kill her. So, there's going to be some rumble.<br /><br />The movie has awesome special effects and some good action scenes. The famous chase is great and the action is nonstop. But, in this one, Arnold actually tries to be funny. His line "talk to the hand" was just hilarious but I like it better when he makes me laugh on accident. So strap yourself in for a god movie with great special effects and good action. The movie isn't as good as the first 2 but blows away must # 3s in a series.</p></body></html>

The same can be said about Owen Wilson and his brothers. I think that the two of them are first class actors and entertainers which makes me sad to have to dissent from popular opinion regarding the worth of this film. It is not so much a movie as it is a series of soundbytes. The action is totally contrived. In the beginning, a seemingly endless sequence of wedding euphoria is rehashed wherein our two fellas are the life of every party and become the idol of spinsters, children, and grandparents. It's all very cute-too cute, in fact. It's more a trailer than a full length production. Actually, were it not for the endemic charm of Vaughn and Wilson, we would not even care about these characters in the least; they'd be a void. I think the blame for this "tries too hard" release must be placed solely on the shoulders of the director, David Dobkin as this is the first time I've seen Vince Vaughn be bad in anything. He is not believable in his role and overacts throughout. That Dobkin was able to diminish the comedic talents of Wilson and Vaughn is an ugly reverse achievement. It's unfortunate as the film could have been something because the premise was great.</p></body></html>

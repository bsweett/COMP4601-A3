<meta name="summary" content="A More Perfect Hulk"></head><body><p>Action packed and kinetic. This one maintains a better pace than the first one. The first attempt tried to be very cerebral and focus on the inner workings of the characters, forgetting to put in some real action. Here, that has been rectified.<br /><br />The action is very well done and the effects of the Hulk character are about as realistic as you could expect a giant green man to appear.<br /><br />However, a couple of the fight scenes -- particularly the last one between the Hulk and the Abomination -- are filmed a little too close to really be able to easily follow the action.<br /><br />Other than that, this one is great. Here's hoping Marvel moves forward with the same love of their characters as they produce their own movies.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A completely unnecessary over the top sequel"></head><body><p>Rules are meant to be broken and it's very obvious here why. This is due to the fact that the rules of gravity are irrelevant in this sequel to the much better predecessor. Frank Martin A.K.A the transporter is back but this time he is a chauffer for a wealthy family's son, as a matter of fact a senator's son. In this movie the story is so unoriginal; everything is so similar to previous action movies. Take for example the plot revolving a lethal virus, if infected the individual will infect many others, and the only one that can stop it is the malevolent bad guy who started the virus in the first place and only he holds the anti-virus. This story is very reminiscent to that of mission impossible 2. The films plot isn't the only thing that has a problem but the action as well. As mentioned before there is no such thing as gravity in the movie. All of the fight sequences are over the top and really exaggerating. Nevertheless it is entertaining and Jason Statham gives a good performance once again but other than that it's a very inferior sequel with very little credibility.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 OUT OF 5</p></body></html>

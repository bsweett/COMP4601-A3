The story is entertaining and fairly interesting if a bit cheesy and cliched at times, with several plot holes. Brendan Fraser does a decent job as the main character, and the adventure he has with his nephew and tour guide is fun to follow. Rent this movie before you decide to buy, some will like it more than others. B-</p></body></html>

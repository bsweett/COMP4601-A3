Hitler might be said to have perfected Hanussen's art, and later repaid his teacher by having Hanussen killed.<br /><br />THE ILLUSIONIST, however, does not touch on these facts. Instead, it is a heavily stylized, darkly atmospheric, and deeply convincing period film which recounts how Eisenheim and Sophie manage to carry on a love affair while discrediting Sophie's fiance, the Crown Prince of Austria-Hungary. (The historical Crown Prince, Rudolf, committed suicide after murdering his mistress.)<br /><br />Edward Norton (and forgive me, but I can never think of him without thinking of Art Carney) plays Eisenheim with an understated intensity, as a man convinced of his own rightness who manages, despite this, to never misstep into arrogance. Jessica Biel is beautiful, intelligent, noble, and facile, as Sophie. Both give excellent performances, but the stellar performance of this film belongs to Paul Giamatti, as Police Inspector Uhl, the agent of the Crown Prince, who becomes half-conspirator and half-pawn in the convoluted plan hatched by Eisenheim and Sophie to steal away from Vienna together.<br /><br />THIS FILM IS VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</p></body></html>

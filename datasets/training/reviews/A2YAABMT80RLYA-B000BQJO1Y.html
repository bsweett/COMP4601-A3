<meta name="summary" content="The mother of all zombie movies rises again."></head><body><p>"Dawn of the Dead" has had a few previous released on DVD, all of which are now extremely rare, so it comes as a blessing that Anchor Bay has released a new version, just in time to coincide with the remake hitting theatres (with Sarah Polley and Ving Rhames, no less). While the movie itself and the extras are fantastic, this may not be the best edition to buy, read on to find out why.... <p>The movie itself needs no introduction to any horror fan, as this is widely considered to be one of the best horror movies ever made, and by far the best zombie picture. I will skip right to the qualities of the DVD itself, to save boredom for anyone who already knows the plot (which I imagine is everybody reading this). The most notable feature on the Divimax DVD is the commentary from George Romero and Tom Savini, with Perry Martin doing the moderating. Similar to the commentary on "Day of the Dead", both Savini and Romero are lively and enthusiastic about this movie, which is surprising considering that the movie is more than 25 years old. The anecdotes and back stories will definitely give fans some insight, as well as plenty of trivia knowledge. This is probably the best Romero commentary so far. The only other extras are an extensive photo gallery (with some great shots), and some promotional material that most people have seen already. If the extras seem sparse, there is a reason for that: rumor has it that Anchor Bay is planning a larger, more extensive Special Edition later in 2004. Like the "Lord of the Rings" DVDs, the first release might be just a taster. <p>Before moving onto the less positive aspects, it should be noted that this is perhaps the video transfer released so far. While previous editions were fragmented, grainy, and muddy looking, this one is clear, having scrubbed 25 years worth of wear and tear on the master. This beats all previous editions, hands down.<p>My gripes with the new "Dawn of the Dead" DVD are nothing to do with what was included, but what was not included. This version runs 127 minutes, while as any fan knows, the original prints ran 142 minutes. The previous "Director's Cut" released on DVD was 137 minutes long (the only time I have seen the full 142 released was on an import laserdisc), so why couldn't they have included the longer cut here? For fans waiting for a new release, this is a bit of a letdown. Also noticeable is the lack of any documentaries or other supplements beyond the commentary. This is understandable if this release is only a taster, however, so I will be waiting in hopes that the new edition solves this problem.<p>Overall, horror fans could not ask for a better movie to have on DVD, even if completists like me are unhappy with the shorter cut. The remastering alone makes this worth the price tag alone, while the commentary is a welcome addition to the movie.</p></body></html>

I've been a fan of his since "Raiders," but I totally skipped such offerings as "K-19: The Widowmaker" and "Hollywood Homicide," as did audiences.  Thus, I was somewhat excited when "Firewall" appeared to be a decent action flick; well, not excited enough to watch it until a year after its release, but at least I did eventually see it.  I got about what I expected - a completely average, predictable action movie.<br /><br />Ford plays Jack Stanfield, a security technician at a large bank; or at least I think that's what he was - these kinds of details were mostly glossed over.  A group of British thieves decides to kidnap Stanfield's family, including his lovely architect wife, Virginia Madsen, and two annoying kids.  The murky plan involves Stanfield transferring funds to them, although it's later revealed that a new security system makes such a transfer seemingly impossible.  The kidnappers, led by a perpetually sneering Paul Bettany, supposedly tracked this family for weeks ahead of time and knew every detail about this job; how could they have overlooked such a crucial detail?  Well, that's just the beginning of the holes in the plot line.  Toward the end of the movie, Ford has to explain to his secretary everything that has happened; the look of confusion on her face summed up how I felt as well.<br /><br />"Firewall" advertised itself as a high-tech thriller, focusing on computer security systems.  However, the movie really drops the ball repeatedly on this angle.  Every time the high-tech elements get going, we cut to another lame fight scene or explosion.  I wish it had stuck more faithfully to the high-tech plot, particularly given how old Ford is starting to look during fight scenes.  "Firewall" makes me really hope that the upcoming Indiana Jones movie focuses on humor and not Ford puffing through action scenes.  Overall, "Firewall" is a passable thriller - the kind Hollywood pumps out at least 6 per summer.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Action, Horror and...Political/Family Intrigue...?"></head><body><p>Take one part Horror movie, one part action movie and mix in just a bit of political intrigue as well as a bit of classical Shakespearian family values (which usually involved stabbing a family member in the back) and you have Underworld: Evolution.<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale once again paints on the fighting black leather and assumes the attitude and killer instinct that go with the character of Selene, a Vampire death dealer.  She continues in the movie to search for more answers to questions that were brought about in the first Underworld.  Quite frankly, I thought this was a better movie than the first.  The story was more clear and easier to follow, but surprisingly complex and full of characters who weren't falling into a sterotype.  As Selene and the Werewolf/Vampire Hybrid, Michael (Scott Speedman) rush to make sure that Marcus (one of the oldest and most powerful of warriors, and a hybrid himself) doesn't free his brother William (the first of the Lycans).  If he does, destruction will reign...we can assume.  These two brothers are tough as we find out in the opening and the truck battle scene of the movie.<br /><br />Michael is not to be toyed with.  After Kraven releases him, he searches for the key to unlock his brothers prison.  A lot of things from the first movie start to play a part in this movie as we find out more about Selene's mortal family and the role they play in this.  We find out more about the oldest immortal, William and Marcus' father, who refuses to kill his own sons.  The story becomes more dangerous and more insidious as it moves to the climax.  Blood and gore abound in this movie, giving it the well deserved R rating, but it's actually confined to the fight scenes and does not seem out of place for the type of fighting that's going on.<br /><br />Overall, the movie was better than expected.  It had a brisk pace, a good story and dialogue as well as great action sequences and impressive special affects.</p></body></html>

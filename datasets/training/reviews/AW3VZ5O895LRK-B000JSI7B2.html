And Johnny Depp does his usual first class acting job.  Some are complaining that his accent wasn't authentic but I could hear and understand every word he said which I probably couldn't have if he'd used a genuine Cockney accent.  I think the factor that causes this film to just miss classic status is that the villain is just too far over the top.  This weird thing they do to his eyes, for one, is way too offputting.  I imagine special lenses were inserted into his eyes for this effect.  It is the one effect I could have done without.  This is the story of a detective (Depp) on the trail of Jack the Ripper as he murders prostitutes in Victorian England with Jack being the villain of the piece.  Heather Graham does a nice job playing one of the prostitutes.</p></body></html>

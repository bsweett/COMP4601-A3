<meta name="summary" content="Hell is other people ... a surprisingly effective and dark old school horror thriller"></head><body><p>Sartre, perhaps, said it best: "hell is other people," i.e. we do a good enough job making life difficult for each other here on Earth, so who needs demons?<br /><br />Following a violent storm that wrecks his studio, illustrator David Drayton takes his son Billy into town for supplies.  Once there, however, an unnatural mist traps them in the supermarket.  The situation goes from inconvenient to horrific when they discover there are monsters in the mist; but mistrust and paranoia lead quickly to a situation inside that is more unsettling than the unknown horrors around them.<br /><br />I just saw this for a second time, and was once again impressed by how effective it was in its dark simplicity and how much it resembled the old school 50's and 60's horror thrillers like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009NHC0">The Thing from Another World</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000K3TO">Night of the Living Dead</a>.  It puts the focus on the human drama, and the way that fear and mistrust can make human beings worse than any monster.  Marcia Gay Harden's apocalyptic power grab was truly frightening, and it's rare that commercial Hollywood filmmakers have the guts to deliver on a premise as scary as this one, and carry it through to the finish.  Compare the ending of this film, which is smaller scale but to my mind more effective and in its own way sublime, to the ending of Steven Spielberg's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNTI">War of the Worlds</a>, or to the ending of any other conventional Hollywood horror film and it will be clear how unique Darabont's approach was here, that managed to ramp up even on the darkness of Stephen King's original vision.  I'll take this kind of inventive and thoughtful horror anyday over torture porn like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006SSOHC">Saw</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UNYK3A">Hostel</a>.</p></body></html>

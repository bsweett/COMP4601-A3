<meta name="summary" content="The calapse of Hollywood is near."></head><body><p>I guess in the age of NO talent movie stars, writters that love violence and Hollywood being a distructive force for morality this movie doesn't surprise me.  Nor will it surprise you.  It's Hollywood telling the same old story over and over again but each time with a little more violence.  As most educated people know this kind of thing just shows the rest of the world what kind of people we really are.  They see everything from the eyes of the media and Hollywood.  I wait for the fall of Hollywood.  The talent just doesn't exist anymore.  The time of good Hollywood stars, music scores, writers, directors, costume designers and now a thing of the past.  Save yourself money and not go which would be the political correct thing to do as far as i'm concerned.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="All The Right Notes"></head><body><p>My wife and I went to the movies last year and our choices were BAD SANTA and ELF.<br /><br />Thank God we chose ELF.<br /><br />This movie hits all the right notes and will become holiday traditional viewing like A CHRISTMAS STORY and IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.  They really knew what they were doing by making it family friendly too.<br /><br />Will Ferrell is absolutely perfect as "Buddy," an adopted elf who discovers he's human and heads to New York to find this real father.  His energy and exuberance, along with a funny script, really makes this one work.<br /><br />I haven't even watched the extras yet but the movie is funny enough to give it five stars.</p></body></html>

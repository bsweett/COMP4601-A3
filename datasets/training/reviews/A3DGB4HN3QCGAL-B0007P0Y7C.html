<meta name="summary" content="Might be OK for a Jennifer Garner fan"></head><body><p>Not having seen this movie in the theatre I bought a copy mainly because the TV spots looked good.<br /><br />Somehow the story seemed slow moving and not a lot to it. I don't know how closely the plot might follow the comic books (apparently even they have changed over time)but I found that watching Jennifer Garner was the best part of it, she did very well as her character. The action scenes were interesting but there was a lot of talk and flashback stuff that just dragged it down for me.<br /><br />Elektra's abandoned childhood home, I noticed that it still had electricity and the gas was on in the kitchen, that looked like a flaw to me. The furniture sheets battle in that big room looked a little bit computer generated but interesting. I did like the extras included, seeing how some of the movie was made helped out a little.</p></body></html>

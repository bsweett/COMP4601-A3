In essence, vampires and werewolves co-exist but don't get along.  Vampires are civilized folk; werewolves are bestial superhero types who "Hulk out" when they get mad.  This war rages around normal humanity, who is unaware of their presence. In fact, Underworld and the World of Darkness are so similar that there was a lawsuit about it. Google "Sony White Wolf lawsuit" for more info.<br /><br />Where last we left our anti-heroes, the Death-Dealer vampire known as Selene (the delectable Kate Beckinsale) and her half-werewolf/half-vampire boy-toy Michael Corvin (the shirtless Scott Speedman), had essentially destroyed an entire clan of vampires under Viktor (Bill Nighy, in flashbacks). The plot gets complicated from there, but it centers around Viktor's clan attempting to wipe out a werewolf clan, when in reality the two were in league with each other.  Selene and Michael are ultimately Viktor's downfall.<br /><br />At the end of the first Underworld movie, another ancient vampire had just awakened.  His name is Marcus (Tony Curran), and he makes Viktor look like a fluffy bunny.  If you've seen the first movie, it revealed a dark secret about vampires and werewolves.  That secret is integral to Marcus' plan, and he sets it into motion immediately by taking to the air.  Marcus, ya see, is more bat than vampire.  He has big scary wings that can morph into talons (like a chicken!).<br /><br />Marcus is out to rescue William (Brian Steele), a werewolf who is meaner, nastier and more contagious than Marcus is vampire-y. We never quite find out what their plans are together, but it surely involves global domination. A special ops group led by Corvinus (Sir Derek Jacobi) gets involved as a result.  Mostly, the SWAT-team like guys serve the same purpose as those poor saps in Terminator 2...to prove how dangerous the bad guy is by getting their butts handed to them.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Selene and Michael explore interspecies relations and Michael learns just what it means to be a vampire.  All of this is shot through a blue lens; so much so that the movie might be appropriately named "Underwater" instead.<br /><br />Underworld: Evolution ups the struggle between vampires and werewolves to over-the-top, superhero levels.  Marcus is a one-vampire killing machine; he can lift heavy stone walls with his bare hands, blast through wooden structures, and take shotgun blasts to the face.  Fortunately, Selene has Michael on her side; as a hybrid, he's pretty powerful himself.  And he looks a lot like Nightcrawler for some reason.<br /><br />Evolution isn't just violent; it's hyper-violent.  Whereas Underworld had to beat the record for most shots fired in a film, Evolution claims the new title of most heads removed in the most disgusting manner possible.  This is a rated R film for a reason.  Why so many kids were in the movie theater, I'll never understand.<br /><br />The good news is that Evolution makes no bones about what it is: another installment in an ongoing series.  Underworld could easily be a cable-TV mini-series with a very large budget.  The bad news is that I didn't remember the plot details from the first film very well and that made the film confusing in parts.<br /><br />The action is amazing when it gets going, the acting is appropriate (bless Sir Derek Jacobi, he lends it some gravitas), and the special effects are well integrated into the film.  With all that blue lens camerawork, you can't go wrong. The soundtrack is actually an improvement over the first.  It's less painfully angsty and more relevant to the action.  And of course, there's the fact that Selene takes her clothes off.<br /><br />Oh wait, is that just me?<br /><br />Ahem. There are two movie tropes I really hate.  One is slow-motion scenes, which are blessedly rare in Evolution.  The other is flashbacks.  Evolution is 30 percent flashbacks.  The movie flashes back to memories of Selene, scenes from the original movie, and scenes that bridge the gap between the two films.  These flashbacks take place through a yellow lens.  Sometimes, we get flashbacks when we need them. Most of the time, we get flashbacks hammering home a point far too many times (WE GET IT, SELENE DREW A SUN ON A WALL).<br /><br />I'm a big fan of Dog Soldiers, the ultimate werewolf movie, and Underworld borrowed the same special effects for its werewolves.  Basically, instead of using computer graphics for werewolves (which aren't nearly as convincing due to all the hair), you put a guy in stilts and a fur suit.  The effect is startling if filmed correctly.<br /><br />William, the only werewolf that uses this style of special effect, instead looks like a stubby-armed wuss.  Mostly, he roars and wails as he gets his butt whipped good.  For an ultimate werewolf, he's a real letdown. Sorry, but I like my werewolves mean and nasty.  The werewolf pack from Dog Soldiers would be ashamed to be associated with such a whiny pup.<br /><br />Those flaws aside, Evolution is really a sequel for people who like vampires, skin-tight leather, and Kate Beckinsale.  If you fall into any of those categories, you'll be clapping along with the rest of the audience at the end.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Disturbing in some ways, but extremely enticing"></head><body><p>We just watched this movie last night, and it caught us off guard. Without any preconceived notions, I was totally ready for the proverbial chick flick. Boy, was I wrong! "Closer" is the latest work by Mike Nichols, the Director of "The Graduate" and "Angels in America" among other great works. Past the first half of the movie, one name kept coming to my mind: David Cronenberg. Granted that the movie is not repulsive in a physical sense, emotionally speaking, it pushes you hard and far to the point of turning sensuality repulsive and making love look like one crazy game.<br /><br />Natalie Portman once more delivers, just like in "Garden State". Jude Law plays one sick game-playing guy. Clive Owen kills me with his lines, his brutal "honesty" and his "open" mind. Julia Roberts typically delivers an average performance, but when pushed by his co-stars' lines, she also explodes with magnificence. Overall not meant to cheer you up on a gloomy day, but nevertheless a well acted movie with a fairly convoluted and twisted plot.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Even Non -Star Trek fans can enjoy this one"></head><body><p>Even those viewers who dislike Star Trek about as fervently as Trekkies love the show can enjoy this episode in the movie series...  I have never liked Star Trek, not even when I was a young kid, but I have to admit that  this stirring adventure movie had me thrilled.  This is the only ST movie  that I would recommned to the casual viewer, it combines human drama with  interesting special effects and (for once) interesting characters...I will  definately be adding this to my DVD collection</p></body></html>

Something about this movie though seemed to fall flat. The acting was wooden and the emotions seemed fake. It wasn't really a great love story and seemed to lack real passion. After the first time, all of their meetings seemed painful, unsatisfying and not worth the effort. The overall tone of the movie was moody and I found the ending a little anti-climactic. I really respect the fact that writers and studios are getting brave enough to branch out and make movies about taboo subjects like this. It was a good effort but not a great movie. It wasn't terrible, it just left me feeling empty. It's kind of a depressing storyline with not a lot of happy moments, just a lot of pain, drama and problems. There seemed to be little chemistry between the two actors. Let me just say, I have no problem with people being gay and I would have felt the same way if this was a heterosexual story! There just were no sparks, and the movie came off as cold or lukewarm at best.</p></body></html>

The theatrical release, most likely at studio insistence, was handed a PG-13 rating. The DVD version is the director's cut, which runs 15 minutes longer and would undoubtedly have gave been given an R rating. [It's unrated.] Perhaps this more violent version is also more cohesive.<br /><br />I don't condone violence. I'm of those wimps who believes in some sort of gun control and who was against the invasion of Iraq. But I know ours is a society that has always condoned - and, in many ways - lionized violence.<br /><br />The movies have always reflected our values. Gangsters - and, later, the Mafioso - were enshrined as cultural icons. Westerns gleefully depicted the near genocide of Native Americans. Cartoon shorts, which I love, are quite violent. [Bugs vs. Elmer, The Road Runner vs. The Coyote, Daffy Duck vs. anyone who crosses his path, etc.]<br /><br />This movie is violent, but the killing is more in synch with today's video games than it is with the real world. [Again, Hollywood's reflecting today's culture.]<br /><br />The story is nonsensical, but is no dumber than the plots of either of the two modern "Mummy" movies or of "Starship Troopers". If anything, the movie is far more sumptuous visually than any of those movies. The screenwriters may have been asleep at the wheel, but the digital special effect people were not.<br /><br />The main reason for the failure of "The Chronicles of Riddick", both with critics and with the public, may be the Hollywood publicity machine. The machine is now totally corporate. Said machine has been intent on making Vin Diesel an action star a la Arnold Schwazenegger or Stallone. What the machine does not understand is that, while Diesel may be a true action star, he is being propelled by a machine, rather than by a series of wise career choices.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great film, decent presentation, short on extras for a BD"></head><body><p>There are some excellent reviews here for film content and story so once again I will stick with the BD type review.<br /><br />I thought this was an excellent film from start to finish with plenty of technical tests for an HD display. There are a multitude of night shots and action scenes in dark places, with a spattering of desert, city and urban sequences. I watched this on several LCD and plasma displays and the film easily shows the shortcomings of the displays that are less than a 120 refresh rate.<br /><br />In watching the 2 short docus accompanying the BD (which are the same as the DVD features) there are different styles of cameras used which shows through on some of the night shots; Some grain and artifact appear infrequently but it does not detract in any significant way. The sound and music are mixed adequately to test the high ranges and mids. But for a BD presentation, it cannot compete with 5 star BDs, especially with the special features being overlooked almost entirely. There is some nice locale footage in the 2nd docu, but both total less than 10 minutes.<br /><br />This is one of those titles that stands alone on the film content/production. I think this was an overlooked film that deserves more coverage/pre-release placement.</p></body></html>

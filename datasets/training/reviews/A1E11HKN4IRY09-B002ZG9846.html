I left the theater so pleasantly surprised, I couldn't fathom why this classic film could be marketed so wrongly. Even the name ROBOCOP suggests something uber-cheesy. I was totally exhilarated by ROBOCOP and the complex, funny, and character driven script that led to the great film I had viewed. I feel exactly the same about KICK-ASS. I had zero desire to see this film in it's theatrical release. All based on advertising. I had expected something as cheesy and kid friendly as SPIDERMAN 1, 2, or 3. What was delivered to me was one of the most chaotic, unapologeticly adult oriented flicks I've ever been privy to view. Not unlike ROBOCOP, KICK-ASS is an intelligent, character driven motion picture geared for the sensibilities, and sense of humor, of the mature viewer that needs a movie like this to remind them that some movies are made to ENTERTAIN. And that's what this flick does. It's damn entertaining. It's much better going into this knowing little about the storyline, so I'm not divulging. Best flick in a while, check it out.</p></body></html>

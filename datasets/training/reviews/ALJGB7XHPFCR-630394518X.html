<meta name="summary" content="Deadly Sins!"></head><body><p>Kevin Spacey has reached the top of the spooky scale with &quot;Seven&quot;. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman play two detectives on the trail of a maniacal killer who is leaving bodies throughout the city, each with messages of the seven deadly sins of the bible. As the movie progresses, the race to catch the killer becomes more frantic and the story becomes even more thrilling. Also gracing the screen in &quot;Seven&quot; is Gwyneth Paltrow. All the actors do a great job, and make their characters very believable. &quot;Seven&quot; is a wonderfully, suspenseful movie that will have you on the edge of your seat to the end. &quot;Seven&quot; slashes it's way to five out of five stars and to the top of the must see movie list.</p></body></html>

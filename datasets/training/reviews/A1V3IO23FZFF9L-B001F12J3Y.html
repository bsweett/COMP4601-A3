<meta name="summary" content="Cute but not great"></head><body><p>This is a cute movie, but it is lost on an adult. It has great CGI and the chaarcters are so well done, they could pass as real people. The voices are great. Hanks does a good job on all his characters. The story is a little bland for this adult. A good attempt but it lacks something.</p></body></html>

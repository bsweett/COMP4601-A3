Vardalos, in my humble opinion, was very brave to go on camera without her makeup.  This movie gave hope to a lot of plain Janes when Toula captured the heart of Ian. (John Corbett from Sex and the City Fame).  Her loud, overbearing and obnoxious family are adorable in their own way.  Overall, highly recommended.</p></body></html>

The relationship between DiCaprio and Christopher Walken is almost as good as the one between DiCaprio and Tom Hanks.  The bond between them is not immediately apparent and it is highly unorthodox, but, by the end, you completely believe the friendship that has arisen before our eyes.<br /><br />The plot itself is very interesting, and I have to say that the ending was not what I expected.  The film definitely delivers, and, other than "What's Eating Gilbert Grape," this was the first movie that I really liked DiCaprio in.  I found his work to be the weak link in "Gangs of New York."  Hanks, of course, is outstanding once again.<br /><br />Lastly, the film has some very picturesque moments, such as the scene with the 8 old school stewardesses escorting the main character through the Miami airport as Sinatra's song massages our ears in the background.  This one is certainly unique as it has a retro, yet not dated, feel to it.</p></body></html>

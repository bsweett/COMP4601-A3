This movie WILL creep you out. The first 15 minutes are classic. This movie does indeed get under your skin, as many other reviewers have put it, and you'll find that its hard to get it off of your mind. Really. It's true. You won't be able to get it off your mind, unless your an idiot like me and you go to a midnight showing right before you go home and go to bed. Lol. I had that song in my head the entire night. I am normally not like that with horror movies, but for some reasons, certain scenes from this movie just would not leave me--the scene inside the Creeper's cave for example, and esp. the abrupt, freaky ending.

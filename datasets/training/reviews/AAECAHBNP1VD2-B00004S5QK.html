<meta name="summary" content="The musical for those who hate musicals!!"></head><body><p>Despite the fact it's a musical, SITR is one of the most watchable films ever made. The acting is great, ditto the camerawork, and there are just enough musical numbers; not too many that they get in the way of the plot (which is superb, BTW... funny as hell in some spots), and none that are too overblown. This was easily both the absolute height of Reynolds' and O'Connor's careers ("Make'Em Laugh" is a masterpiece), and one of Kelly's  very finest moments as well. And don't forget Cyd Charisse in that green outfit!!</p></body></html>

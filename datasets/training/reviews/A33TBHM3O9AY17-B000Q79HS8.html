Imagine my glee when I saw "The Bourne Supremacy", which takes all the best elements of the first movie to the next level.  This easily ranks among the best action movies I have seen to date.<br /><br />"Identity" ends with Jason Bourne slipping out of the CIA snare that was laid for him, and dropping off the radar for good -- or so it seems.  "Supremacy" opens with Bourne having made a new life for himself in a remote corner of the world, while he continues to wrestle with his incomplete memories.  He is still haunted by nightmares that he can't pinpoint, and still hasn't figured out the details behind the plot to kill him.  He seems to have plenty of time to get it all worked out.<br /><br />All that changes, however, when Bourne's fingerprints appear at the scene of an assassination that he didn't commit, this time of a top CIA field operative.  The CIA doesn't know it's a frame-up, and takes very personally the death of one of their own.  Their response is, of course, to try to take out Bourne for good this time.  The first attempt on Bourne's life results in the death of his lover instead, which prompts Bourne to take the fight directly to the CIA this time.<br /><br />So begins a riveting, non-stop sequence of maneuver and counter-move, thrust and parry, as Bourne and his foes match wits and weapons in a deadly dance that will not end until Bourne is dead.  But Bourne has other plans, none of which include his own death.  He systematically begins his own investigation and retraces the steps of his own past as he strives to unlock the mysteries that continue to haunt him.  All the while, he confounds his pursuers at every turn -- somehow making it look easy, and leaving the viewer frequently breathless with suspense.<br /><br />Just like the first movie, "Supremacy" is pulse-pounding, sexy and high-tech from beginning to end.  In fact, the second movie pushes all of these elements to their credible limits.  Unlike your typical action hero flick or James Bond movie, there is not a single shred of this movie that challenges the viewer's credulity or makes you think "that could never happen in real life."  In short, this movie has all the best of the action movie genre without the corny lack of realism, coupled with high suspense that never eases up.  I can't wait for the next Bourne movie (I hope, anyway).</p></body></html>

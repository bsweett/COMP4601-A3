<meta name="summary" content="Intelligent, nuanced tale of childhood friends and vampires"></head><body><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />A movie where the undead are back to their former role of ghastly bloodsucking creatures (who don't sparkle, but that's another matter), Let the Right One In is passable as a vampire film but really impresses in its nuanced depiction of a friendship between two young outcasts who find solace in each other; be warned that it's often a very graphic film, but it's also often a very good one.<br /><br />3/4</p></body></html>

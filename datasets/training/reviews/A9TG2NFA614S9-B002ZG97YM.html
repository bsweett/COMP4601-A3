The setting is a Viking village where the men are big, brawny, husky warriors, and the wives are pretty imposing as well. The village is besieged by dragons in all sizes, shapes and colors who swoop down and take away livestock and anything else edible. Hiccup is a nerdy kid whose father does not have faith in him as a dragon-slayer. The kid does bring down a dragon, but no one believes him.<br /> He goes hunting for the downed dragon and finds that he has only wounded it, shot off one of its tail fins so it is unable to fly. The kid miraculously befriends the dragon, and clever boy that he is makes a new rudder-operated tailfin for the dragon. The boy learns that dragons are basically friendly, and they can be tamed and made into pets.<br /> The scenes where the boy on his home-made saddle goes soaring through the air on the back of the dragon are worthy of scenes in "Avatar." He wins over a girlfriend by showing her his prowess with dragons. The boy is clever, resourceful, a good artist, and compassionate.<br /> Most animated films made primarily for children have worthy lessons to impart which are embedded in the story. They don't preach but they do teach. Hiccup's super-macho father comes to admire and respect the boy's skills, and they are brought closer together.<br /> The movie is a mixture of daredevil action sequences, comedy, pathos, and the need for empathy between man and natural creatures. Kids, I think, will learn a lot about Viking ships, costumes, customs, food, and the world of the early Norse society where men were men, and the women were hefty too.<br /> The movie becomes somewhat cutesy in the old Disney style when the dragon becomes endearing and coy. I highly recommend this movie for all.</p></body></html>

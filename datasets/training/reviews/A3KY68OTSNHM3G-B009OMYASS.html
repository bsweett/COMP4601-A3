<meta name="summary" content="Sick and Twisted"></head><body><p>Jay Hernandez (Paxton), Derek Richardson (Josh), and Eythor Gudjonsson (Oli) star as three young college students backpacking across Europe.  But their trip is about to take a turn for the worse.<br /><br />Paxton and Josh are from the United States.  While on their trip in Europe, they met and befriended Oli, who has now become part of the group.  Their mission: to do as many drugs and have sex with as many women as possible.  They have also met another person, who tells them about a town in Slovakia, where the women will do practically anything with a man who has an American accent.  Eager to find out, the three board a train and head for Slovakia.  While on the train, the three meet an extremely odd gentleman, who we will see more of later in the film.<br /><br />Once they reach their deatination, Paxton, Josh, and Oli check into a Hostel.  Sure enough, the man was right; the guys end up sharing a room with two gorgeous women, and the sex and drugs begin to flow.<br /><br />However, strange things begin to happen.  Oli suddenly checks out of the hostel without telling Josh or Paxton.  Then, a few days later, Josh does the same thing, only he finds himself in a torture chamber along with the man from the train.  This deranged man is doing unspeakable things to Josh, including slicing his hamstrings.  Meanwhile, Paxton is beginning to become suspicious of the two girls.  The girls tell him that his two friends have been taken to a local art museum.  Angered, Paxton tells the girls he wants to go there as well.  So, the girls oblige, and Paxton is forced into the same cruel situation as Josh and Oli were.  But, unlike his friends, Paxton manages to survive, despite having several fingers cut off.<br /><br />Paxton is able to discover that the "art museum" is really some kind of sick place where people can pay money to kill another person.  It costs the most money for someone to have the chance to kill an American; hence, the attraction between the girls and Paxton and Josh.  Will Paxton be able to survive to tell his story, or will he be caught in the end?<br /><br />I've seen a lot of horror movies, but this has to be one of the most bloody and gory I've ever seen.  I've seen all of the "Saw" series of films, and I think that this movie is even more bloody than those.  The first part of the movie has very little killing, but the second half more than makes up for it.  There are several gross scenes, including the slicing of the hamstrings, the cutting of eyeballs, and the use of a drill and chainsaw.  This is definitely not a movie for the squeamish.<br /><br />I thought this was an ok movie, but not a great one.  The large amount of blood and gore were just too much to handle.  True fans of bloody movies will probably enjoy this movie more, but be warned; the amount of blood and gore in this movie is tremendous.  Watch at your own risk.</p></body></html>

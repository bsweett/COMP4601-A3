Not a lot of them, mind you, but they're there.  The comedy came from the improvisational skill of the cast, and not from the predictable, flabby script.<br /><br />He's a five-star jerk, and she's slightly domineering.  Their relationship shouldn't have survived as long as it did, but it lasted long enough for them to buy a condo together.  Of course, there has to be a plot device like this, or else one of them would simply pack up and move on, and there wouldn't be a movie.  They have to stay in the same condo until it sells, and wouldn't you know it, comedy and drama ensue.  Vaughn and Aniston turn in great performances; the supporting cast steals the show.  But, all this talent is in service of a pedestrian, predictable script that drags down the entire film.  On the bright side, this movie photographs Chicago in an original way, without relying on the hackneyed establishing shots we all know so well.<br /><br />Ultimately, the cons outweigh the pros of this movie, but it's still not a bad choice.  It won't make you wish you had your hour and 45 minutes back after you watch it, but it's likely you won't remember it a week later either.</p></body></html>

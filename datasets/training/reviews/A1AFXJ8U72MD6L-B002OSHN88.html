<meta name="summary" content="ONE OF THE BETTER NOIR FILMS"></head><body><p>This is a film you can't watch casually. If you do you'll miss a lot of the nuances. Don't feel bad if you have to watch it more than once to get it either. You won't be the first. On that note this is one of the Noir classics. It's won a ton of awards, including AFI's Top 100 and Britain's Academy Awards for Best Film. Tale focuses on an author of Westerns who comes to Vienna because his friend, Harry Lime, offered him a job. However, when he arrives he finds out that Harry Lime was killed in a car accident yet when he investigates it he finds contradictory facts being tossed out to him. That's where the title comes into play. Look for the extreme close ups and strangely placed camera angles. The American writer's optimism and sometimes blind loyalty to his friend contrasts vividly at times with the cynical Post War gloominess of Vienna. In Austria, "local critics were underwhelmed" and the film ran for only a few weeks; William Cook, after his 2006 visit to an eight-room museum in Vienna dedicated to the film, wrote "In Britain it's a thriller about friendship and betrayal. In Vienna it's a tragedy about Austria's troubled relationship with its past." The musical score is strangely alluring. CHARACTER/DIALOGUE: B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B to B plus; NOIR FOCUS: B plus to A minus; WHEN WATCHED: mid October 2011 (streamed); OVERALL GRADE: B plus. BEST DIALOGUE: Calloway: Go home Martins, like a sensible chap. You don't know what you're mixing in, get the next plane. Martins: As soon as I get to the bottom of this, I'll get the next plane. Calloway: Death's at the bottom of everything, Martins. Leave death to the professionals. Martins: Mind if I use that line in my next Western? /// You know what the fellow said - in Italy, for thirty years under the Borgias, they had warfare, terror, murder and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance. In Switzerland, they had brotherly love, they had five hundred years of democracy and peace - and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.</p></body></html>

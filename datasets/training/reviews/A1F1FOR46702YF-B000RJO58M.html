Sgt. Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) is London's finest and most dedicated police officer who is reassigned by his superiors to the small crime-free village of Sanford. When a series of suspicious and gruesome accidents stuns this uneventful village, Sgt. Angel and his bumbling new partner Danny Butterman (Nick Frost) learn that there is more to Sanford than it appears. "Hot Fuzz" is definitely one of the year's funniest films. The story is entertaining and offers some nice twists and very funny moments. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have great comic chemistry. The 2007 action-comedy also stars Timothy Dalton (The Living Daylights), Bill Nighy (Pirates of the Caribbean) and Academy Award winner Jim Broadbent (Iris). "Hot Fuzz" received overwhelming positive reviews from critics and proved a commercial success earning more than twice of "Shaun of the Dead".<br /><br />If you missed "Hot Fuzz" in theaters, then I strongly recommend checking out this acclaimed comedy on DVD. "Hot Fuzz" is presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The DVD contains a colorful and detailed video transfer. Its 5.1 EX Dolby Digital sound is clean and well balanced. The interactive menus are very appealing. Among special features, it includes the hilarious "The Man Who Would Be Fuzz" featurette, outtakes, deleted scenes, storyboards, trailers, "Fuzz-O-Meter" trivia option and a fun audio commentary with star Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright. Overall, "Hot Fuzz" scores a "B+".</p></body></html>

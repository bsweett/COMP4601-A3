However, this is a longed-for Us vs. Nahtzees movie.  Killing the Jews is like Killing Gandalf times 6 million and more.  Why would you think that anyone shares your anti-semitism?  Why would you believe that when you KNOW that you hate Jews not because they did anything but because you are all wrong inside of you?  This movie expresses so much about the war against evil.  The American self-confident disdain in a seemingly unedumacated manner embodied by Brad Pitt's character, the young bright elf eyes of Eli Roth and the sadness and young eagerness when he spies his chance to get Adolf,  the appalling rudeness and their delight in boot-stomping their way into private French residences and making French fathers fear for their daughters, the endurance and the high quality of the French Jewish heroine who SUFFERS and sees so clearly, the clarity that most of us reach about the Nahtzees and their fantasies of popularity and grandeur and getting the red carpet treatment embodied in the Frederick Zoller character who has a pocketful of modest mannerisms ready for anticipated accolades.  The Oscar win went to the most well-constructed and hard working performance in the film.  The Oscar win came about due to the German actor's effort and the complex role given him.  His performance is worth remembering. It doesn't sit well with anyone of us when we hear that so many Nahtzees were given American citizenship by the CIA for the information they could give the Allies.  Is the Lando character supposed to be Rudolph Hess?  If so, I hope the English have him and not the Americans.  We've got more than we want here already.  I bet Rudy told the Allies EVERYTHING and had fun doing it.  Hilariously, Quentin Tarantino made real life Skrull Diane Kruger beg to audition for the role because he claimed he didn't believe that she was really German.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It's a bummer.."></head><body><p>Well, I'm giving anything having to do with The Big Lebowski the most stars you can give. It is only the greatest thing since sliced bread. Every scene, every actor, every line. This movie is perfection. It's hard to pick because they all stand out, but John Goodman especially knocks it out of the park in this one. More than a movie, this is part of my life and a lot of other people I know too. So... do you need the special edition? No. Don't get it unless you don't already own the movie to begin with. The special edition one is a bummer and don't waste the money because you have to slip the rent under the landlord's door later. If you don't already have this movie... oh... you gotta get this.</p></body></html>

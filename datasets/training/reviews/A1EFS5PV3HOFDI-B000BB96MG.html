<meta name="summary" content="The story behind the story of how Willy Wonka came to be"></head><body><p>Its hard to say this is a remake, for Tim Burton has twisted this story into a mind of its own. Johnny Depp is superb as the rather odd chocolate inventor, who's childhood was less then perfect and adult life surrounded by an atmosphere children can only dream of.<br /><br />Yes I say childhood, for Burton has given us a look behind the story of Wonka, his father being a dentist who on one halloween threw all of Willy's precious, gathered candy into a fire. Being afraid of the cavities and other trouble sweets bring. Sound dumb? Not at all. Wonka has in consiquence grown up with a twisted idea of how families are, and has a hard time being around parents, even saying the word is torturous for the candy man.<br /><br />Other than that, this remake has run even closer to the book, Veronica being thrown down the garabge shoot by the squarrels instead of trying to get the goose that laid chocolate eggs. Even the Oompa Loompas have undergone changes, and in turn are hipper, wilder and smaller then before.<br /><br />The landscape is very Tim Burtonesque, in the beginning of the movie, its not hard to guess who's the director (If you already didn't know) For the coloring is dark, and the Buckets house has a decided scrunched look, and tilts to the right in a way only Tim Burton could make it tilt without completely falling.<br /><br />I can't quite say though its a movie to take you're children to. With Willy Wonka licking Bug blood of his Machete, to an Oompa Loompa trying to stab Mike Tv, to dolls catching on fire and dying horrible plastic melting deaths. Other than that, apart from the adult moments and understanding of the film, children might enjoy it.</p></body></html>

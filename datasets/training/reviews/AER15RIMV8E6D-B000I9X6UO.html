<meta name="summary" content="An Awesome Film!!!"></head><body><p>I always liked this movie. It's cool how a snobby publicist named Stu is cheating on his wife, then 'the caller' calls Stu at a phone booth, and if Stu hangs up, the caller will shoot him. The caller does shoot someone and everyone thinks Stu did it, then the police get involved. It's also cool that Stu confesses everything to his wife and everyone watching. I would have liked to see a sequel where the caller makes someone else confess their sins. If you love suspense and thrillers, you'll love PHONE BOOTH!!!<br /><br />"Isn't it funny, you hear a phone ring and it could be anybody, but a ringing phone has to be answered, doesn't it?" - The Caller.</p></body></html>

Used to be the corner of his mouth that would exhibit an oddity all of its own, now it's his entire face. Thankfully, this crackerjack explosive thriller requires much of neither. It takes a clearcut plot but throws in some simmering action that is not only updated for the times (think Bourne Identity's Aikido-style stylization), it is also hardboiled enough to make the lily-livered cringe.<br /><br />There's a healthy dose of intelligence in the manner in which our beloved moose blows up entire armies of people using chickenwire, a bow and arrows, and of course his bandanna. Plus, would you believe it, you might also feel an emotion or two because, you know, evil is repugnant and evil is precisely what many of the munchkins in a nondescript Asian island (okay, Burma) happen to be: fresh cardboard variety.<br /><br />A very worthy rental if you know what to expect from a Rambo movie. You'll get it in spades. Literally.</p></body></html>

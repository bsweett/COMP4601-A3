<meta name="summary" content="ONE OF THE BEST FILMS OF THE YEAR OR MAYBE THE DECADE"></head><body><p>SIDEWAYS is the film that made pinot noir the in-wine for a generation and reduced once-chic merlot to near pariah status. I still enjoy a nice merlot but I have to admit that I now know about and buy pinot noir which I did not do before I first saw SIDEWAYS. (One wonders if pinot noir vineyards had an investment in this film. Hmmmm....) Paul Giamatti plays Miles, a hyper, twitchy would-be novelist, recently divorced, and Thomas Haden Church plays his best friend Jack, a laid-back, hunky, second-rate actor. Both take a boys-only, wine-tasting excursion together through the vineyards of California. For Miles this is an opportunity perhaps to contemplate his failed marriage. For Jack, it is his last time to get laid before getting married. Miles, the nuerotic nerd, is a serious student of wines and Jack, the shallow stud, is a serious student of women. One wonders how these two complete opposites ever became best friends. But, putting convenient and somewhat strange screenplay logic aside, Miles and Jack together find adventure, romance and redemption on the road. I have seen SIDEWAYS twice; the second time I enjoyed it more than the first viewing. It is a film that grows on you; a character study and a film with some depth, the perfect antidote to mindless thrillers. The scene where Miles and a recently divorced acquaintance of Miles, played by Virginia Madsen, passionately discuss what they like about wine is worth the price of admission. SIDEWAYS is one of the best films of the year or maybe the decade. Rent it or buy it but enjoy it with a bottle of pinot noir.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A masterpiece of Modern American Cinema"></head><body><p>Every year a motion picture masterpiece comes along that makes us laugh, cry, and never forget what we have just experienced. Million Dollar Baby is the movie for 2004. I never in a million years would have thought I'd feel this way about a boxing film, but boxing seems to be a subplot for the beautiful character studies that make up the majority of the film.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood has outdone himself as actor/director. He won the Oscar for his directing, but is equally fine playing Frankie, a trainer who runs a seedy gym in Los Angeles and reads poetry on the side. Hilary Swank is absolutely phenomenal in her second Oscar winning role as Maggie, a lost soul who has been waitressing since she was 13 and sees boxing as the one way she can escape waitressing for the rest of her life. Morgan Freemon is terrific in another Oscar winning role as Scrap, our narrator, who was managed by Frankie into a title bout. Now he lives in a room at the gym and is Frankie's partner in conversations that have coiled down through the decades. When Frankie refuses to train a "girly," it's Scrap who convinces him to give Maggie a chance: "She grew up knowing one thing. She was trash."<br /><br />Paul Haggis deservedly won an Oscar nomination for adapting the screenplay from the book, Rope Burns: Stories From the Corner, a by Jerry Boyd, a 70-year-old fight manager who wrote it as "F.X. Toole." I haven't read the book, but after experiencing this terrific movie, I'd wanna give it a shot. This deserved every Oscar it won, and possibly more. It is one of the most unforgettable movies of the year, in a year that barely managed to pick 5 Best Picture nominees. While the other nominee's were good, Million Dollar Baby is possibly the only film that actually deserved to get the Best Picture Nomination. Lucky for us, it won.</p></body></html>

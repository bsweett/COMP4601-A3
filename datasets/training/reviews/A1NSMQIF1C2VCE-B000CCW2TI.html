<meta name="summary" content="A nicely focused thriller, with great work from McAdams"></head><body><p>Red Eye doesn't have many ambitions beyond being the ultimate "bad guy to sit next to on an airplane" story. It's like an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents given a slightly longer running time.<br /><br />Fortunately, Rachel McAdams, who has to carry this film, does an admirable job of doing so, without the sort of "look at this great performance" stuff a bigger name might well have given us. And that elevates this bit of fluff into being quite impressive fluff.<br /><br />Fun stuff, and a film that should definitely keep McAdams' star on the rise and help director Wes Craven get more chances to spread his wings without Freddy Kruger around.<br /><br />A definite recommendation for thriller fans.</p></body></html>

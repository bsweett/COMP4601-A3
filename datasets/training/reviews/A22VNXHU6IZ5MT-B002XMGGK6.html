<meta name="summary" content="Great action thriller starring Jamie Foxx and Gerard Butler!"></head><body><p>This is a great thriller. Being a fan of BOTH Jamie Foxx (Ray) and Gerard Butler (300) made this a must seee for me. Lots of great action and suspense. The DVD has great audio, sound and extras. I will upgrade to the blu-ray since that has an unrated director's cut that the DVD version does'nt have. I enjoyed "Law Abiding Citizen" very much!</p></body></html>

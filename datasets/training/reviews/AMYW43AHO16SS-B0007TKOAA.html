<meta name="summary" content="A True Independent Film Classic!"></head><body><p>This is what Hollywood should be concentrating on!  Character development, on location scenery, great performances and a script that is one of the best I've seen and heard in years.  Paul Giamatti is excellent as Miles, the down on his luck author and school teacher trying to get his life in order.  I think he was robbed of an Oscar nomination.  Thomas Haden Church (Ned & Stacey, Wings) gets the break out role of his career as Jack, the guy who is unfaithful but lovable.  Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh round out the cast to make this movie a true Independent film classic.</p></body></html>

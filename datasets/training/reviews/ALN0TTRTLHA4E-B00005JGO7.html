<meta name="summary" content="Great"></head><body><p>English film made by the director of &quot;Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrells&quot;. Lock Stock was a classic and did well in most countries but America. <p>Snatch is not a follow up but a film featuring similar elements. It is set in an English underworld of illegal boxing matches hit men and Jewel Heists. <p>The film is in reality a comedy but it is a violent one. It has a complex structure which is the interweaving of of three basic sets of characters who are invovled in fixing a fight and trying to recover a stolen diamond. Unlike many comedies it falls outside the normal formulas and the twists and turns of the plot have you in stiches. <p>The DVD is probably better than the film as it is easier to understand the dialogue using the subtitle function. Even Brad Pitt is good.</p></body></html>

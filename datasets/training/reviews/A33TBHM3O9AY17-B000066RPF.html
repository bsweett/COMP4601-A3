<meta name="summary" content="The pinnacle of British comedy."></head><body><p>I recently watched this classic again for the first time in years, having previously viewed it about a half dozen times.  It was great to see one of my all-time faves brought to DVD.  The Pythons epitomize the greatest imaginations and creativity in British humor, and this movie is, in my humble opinion, the hands-down best work of the Python troop.<br /><br />There are probably precious few souls who haven't seen this at least once, so there's little I can add about the movie itself that hasn't already been praised in earlier reviews.  I was especially pleased with some of the special features on this DVD, including the "tutorial" on how to maximize the use of coconuts for a full equine "riding" experience.  Needless to say this was done in the classic Python style by Mr. Palin himself.  Also great was the "Camelot" song-and-dance routine done with Lego figures -- brilliant!<br /><br />What can I say?  You need to see this for yourself, so rush right out and get it.  Might as well pick up a coconut while you're at it -- you'll need that too.</p></body></html>

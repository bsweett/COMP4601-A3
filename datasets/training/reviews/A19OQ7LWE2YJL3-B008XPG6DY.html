<meta name="summary" content="A hair better than CLOSER"></head><body><p>Why does Clive Owen make these stinker movies?  I thought CLOSER was one of the absolute worst movies I ever saw with a really great star in it.  UGH.  Then I watched DERAILED and thought "well we have a little category here of really lousy Clive Owen movies".<br /><br />He is a really GOOD actor.  Why in the world does he get involved in these ridiculous films.  I didn't care for this movie at all because it was too far-fetched.  Jennifer Aniston was good as Lucinda, but not quite good enough as a bad girl type.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Chick Flick For Guys"></head><body><p>This is a full-blown one-hankie chick flick, but I still enjoyed it. Cameron Diaz looks impossibly hot. The old folks are real residents of a real Florida place where this movie was shot. Shirley Maclaine has been playing this role for the last 25 years, and she's got it down. Good script. Decent plot line. Nice soundtrack. Not a bad waste of two hours.</p></body></html>

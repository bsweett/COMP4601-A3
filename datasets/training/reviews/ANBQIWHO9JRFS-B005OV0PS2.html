<meta name="summary" content="Not bad, but not some of the Coen's best work"></head><body><p>I dunno why I'm bothering to write this review, as I don't have too much too say and I'm just gonna annoy people, but I feel the impulse.  Anyway, it seems like 'The Big Lebowski' is the most popular Coen brothers film for people in my age bracket, but I can't entirely get into it.  It's got some funny parts, and the main characters are all charming enough and all, but it just seems like it's trying too hard much of the time.  For example, the major dream sequence towards the end: Lame.  Doesn't work, trying too hard.  Furthermore, the film as a whole just generally goes nowhere.  Considering these characters that's pretty much all that could happen, but it just really starts to drag after a while with no focus.  I guess my problem is I don't like the Coens as much when they're doing pure comedy. (And I'd probably have to pick 'Blood Simple' as their best movie, which is, of course, their most purely dramatic movie.  By the way, don't make the mistake of ignoring that film, as it seems like more than a few Coen fans have.  It's amazing.)  Frankly, I think their sorta inexplicable, oddball comedy works best when it's juxtaposed with the violence and darkness.  Though that's not all that's at the heart of 'The Big Lebowski's relative weakness, as I like both 'Raising Arizona' and 'The Hudsucker Proxy' better than it as well and they're both really light hearted.  Still, though I don't think it requires any repeat viewings, 'The Big Lebowski' is definitely worth one look, anyway.  Even when they're pretty of the Coens can make something quite a bit different and more interesting than what you'll usually get at the movies.<br /><br />Grade: C+</p></body></html>

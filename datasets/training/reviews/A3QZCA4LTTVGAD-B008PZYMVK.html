<meta name="summary" content="A surreal, insanely funny masterpiece"></head><body><p>&quot;Being John Malkovich,&quot; directed by Spike Jonze from a screenplay by Charlie Kaufman, was in my opinion one of the most brilliant films of the late 20th century. The film tells the story of an out-of-work puppeteer (an excellent John Cusack) who discovers a portal into the mind of actor John Malkovich (played, curiously enough, by John Malkovich!).<p>BJM is a claustrophobic workplace satire, a surreal sex comedy, a gender-bending love story, and an innovative blending of science fiction and fantasy. Furthermore, the film is a reflection on interspecies communication and the nature of language, a metaphysical exploration of the nature of life and identity, and a somber meditation on the role of the artist in a consumeristic society.<p>Cusack and Malkovich are joined by a superb ensemble cast that brings complete conviction to this bizarre material. Orson Bean is particularly hilarious as Cusack's daffy, horny boss; he delivers his frequently outrageous dialogue brilliantly.<p>BJM is as notable for its stunning visual effects as it is for its amazing dialogue. Such sights as a giant Emily Dickinson puppet give the film a weird, Willie Wonka-ish flavor. Also marvelous are the parodic &quot;films within a film&quot; that spice up the whole. And the film is nicely enhanced by Carter Burwell's fine musical score.<p>BJM is imaginative and truly original; the film's concept is realized brilliantly by a talented cast and crew. I give it my highest recommendation.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Two pals on a week of good times and personal discovery"></head><body><p>"Sideways" is a buddy film where a bachelor week to wine country in Northern California allows two good friends to enjoy some time away from the city.<br /><br />Protagonists Miles (Paul Giamatti) and Jack (Thomas Haden Church) are at different stages in their lives with Miles clinically depressed because of his divorce and Jack about to take the plunge for the first time in his life.<br /><br />The two are an unlikely pair as Miles presents as considerate while Jack is reckless and is only interested in thrills for himself.<br /><br />During their trip away they put themselves in situations which bring out the best and the worst in each other. Their adventures and misadventures are entertaining, yet it is the unveiling of their true demeanour and the direction they take with their lives that gives the viewer a lot to enjoy.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W.

<meta name="summary" content="Actually enjoyable!!"></head><body><p>I was searching around here on amazon.com and wanted to look at some lists compiled by people, with their favorite movies on here...well, came across this little gem, and thought that I would check it out.  I am not one to be a comic book fanatic..but the plot seemed interesting...and was it ever!!  Wit a star cast such as Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson, this was a movie that I could not pass up, and glad that I did not!!<br /><br />The story was very well told, excellent visuals, actors did a wonderful job with the material.  Drawback...at the end, it got a bit weird for my taste...but that is ok...it gave the story another interesting angle...if you are into comic book heros, action, and just plain interesting storylines, give this one a try!!</p></body></html>

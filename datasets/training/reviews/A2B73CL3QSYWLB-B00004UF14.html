Tommy Lee Jones is suave as Agent "K" and, while amusing, Will Smith seems to be riffing off his Fresh Prince persona here as Agent "J".  It's obvious from subsequent solid work he's done that he learned something from the tutelage of a seasoned pro like Jones.  Vincent D'Onofrio does an amusing turn as a malevolent alien who inhabits the body of a rustic type.  My only complaint is the film does not properly utilize the extremely talented Linda Fiorentino who plays the coroner and had done some solid work in independent film.  If this is how she is underused by the mainstream film community she's better off in the independents.</p></body></html>

True, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro were both in The Godfather Part II, but they never appeared together onscreen. But here, we have them together onscreen for the first time, even though it's only ten minutes total. But this isn't the only thing that makes Heat so special.<br /><br />This is certainly one of Michael Mann's most extraordinary films, along with Last Of The Mohicans and Collateral. It's more of a psychological experience (with some operatic touches in the story) when you think about it. Vincent Hanna (Pacino) is a hot-headed Detective who is primarily obssessed with his career, which makes his personal life even more of a living hell. Neil McCauley (De Niro), on the other hand, is a calm professional thief who strictly believes in one rule: "Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner." That is, until a young woman comes into his life. These two figures of undeniable differences collide into what becomes an official operatic tragedy.<br /><br />This is a complete work of art. It's just as epic as the Godfather saga (excluding the length). I love how all the sub-plots are connected with each other, and how we get to understand many of the supporting characters. I especially love the shots of Los Angeles: the scenes in where the skyscrapers are in the background blend in almost perfectly. I especially love Pacino's sarcastic dialogue ("'Cause she got . . . a GREAT A**!"). I even love Dennis Haysbert's own little storyline, and how it relates to an even harsher reality. And don't think that I'll leave out the famous shootout sequence in the middle of the film, because I'm smarter than that. This sequence has got to be one of the finest action sequences ever put on film. The lack of background music makes it all much more realistic, the assault rifles and their echoed sounds are truly authentic, the bullet holes are spot-on, and even the fear and panic of the L.A. citizens become a welcome addition. By the way, Kilmer's reloading should be something worth watching. Why? Because it's bad@**!<br /><br />We've probably all seen Mann, Pacino, and De Niro's films more than once. This one I'll always rewatch until my DVD wears out. This is a classic film of the 90's. I can safely recommend this film to fans of Pacino, De Niro, Kilmer, Mann, action, suspense, drama, and even Moby.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></body></html>

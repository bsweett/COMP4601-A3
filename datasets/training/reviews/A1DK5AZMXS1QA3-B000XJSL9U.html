<meta name="summary" content="Great story, good dialogue, but some overdone action scenes"></head><body><p>In the sequel-dominated decade that is Hollywood since 1999's release of The Phantom Menace, it was only a matter of time before Bruce Willis put in another Die Hard flick.  This time the bad guys are a collection of international criminals led by an ex-fed genius.  The good guys are led by John McClane of the NYPD, his whiz-kid sidekick, and various feds.  Like previous die-hard movies, we have lots of shooting, a gorgeous bad babe, some fistfights, and of course several helicopters, instead of just one as in the previous Die Hard movies.  The evil chic is played by Maggie Q, though this time we have a lady on the good side, McClane's daughter.  Much of the action takes place at night or in dark confines, so watch carefully or you will miss a lot of details.  Still, worth the 2 hours to watch it.</p></body></html>

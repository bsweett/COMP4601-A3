<meta name="summary" content="Scary In Any Language"></head><body><p>THE ORPHANAGE is an excellent film of the ghost story sub genre and should even appeal to horror film fans who usually reject movies filmed in languages other than English.  The English subtitles may detract a bit from the scare factor but the very effective spooky imagery, haunting music and highly atmospheric setting soon make the viewer forget the spoken language is Spanish.  As the title suggests and like so many other classic ghost story films (THE CHANGELING, THE INNOCENTS and THE OTHERS come quickly to mind) children play large roles in both the plot and theme of the film.  And as in most horror movies the viewer must be able to suspend some disbelief concerning some of the characters' unlikely actions and some other unrealistic plot elements.  The film is well acted by actors who are mostly not well known to average American movie fans though Geraldine Chaplin who starred years ago as Tonya in the classic DR ZHIVAGO is perfect as the white faced medium Aurora.</p></body></html>

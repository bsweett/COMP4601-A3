Brian Dennehy escorts him out of town and then brings him to jail because Rambo doesn't want to leave.  Rambo escapes and decides to go to war with the local police force.  The police have no idea what they are getting in to.  After 5 or so officers are quickly disposed of, the police retreat.  Rambo's former superior comes to tell him he needs to give himself up, but Rambo still won't budge.<br /><br />This is a strong portrayal of a man who has not fully recovered from his experiences in the Vietnam war, and when bad memories are brought back, a screw goes loose in Rambo's head.  Now he has pretty much no choice but to fight the police, because he knows he didn't do anything wrong.  Now that an army is after him, he kinda feels more comfortable than he did in every day life.<br /><br />The action scenes are awesome.  Very brutal and very well choreographed.  Stallone's athletic skills look great and he gives the action a lot of life.<br /><br />4/5<br /><br />The DVD from Lions Gate has good picture quality.  Other than minor scratches and a bit of grain, it is perfect.  Sound is also good.<br /><br />Special features include a commentary with Stallone and an alternate ending.  I have the ulitmate edition, not the special edition.</p></body></html>

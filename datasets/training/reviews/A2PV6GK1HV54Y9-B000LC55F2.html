I can't believe how boring this film was, Christian Bale is a talented actor but his character makes you just want to punch him about 500 times, he is so unappealing in this role. To my surprise Hugh Jackman is the character you feel the most sympathy for, too bad he plays such a sucker in this one. And oh god that old-looking, shallow, and unattractive Scarlett Johanseen is enough to ruin anybody's day, ugh! The film has a good premise but all the "I got you" surprises becomes too much and I lost interest after 45 minutes, the ending was cruel and lacked spontaneity. Stay away from this stinker.</p></body></html>

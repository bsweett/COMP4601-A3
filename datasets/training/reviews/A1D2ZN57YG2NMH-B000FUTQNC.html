His role was played to perfection, as was the role of the bank robber, (Paul Bettany.) I had never seen Jack's wife in any other films, but she was great as well! The fight scenes were stellar, there was a great explosion, and a whole lot of genuine suspense.<br /><br />See this, you will love it. Harrison lives on!</p></body></html>

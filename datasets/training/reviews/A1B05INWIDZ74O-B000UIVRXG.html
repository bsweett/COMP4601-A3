<meta name="summary" content="A Comedic Action Film"></head><body><p>Simon Pegg and Nick Frost of SHAUN OF THE DEAD are back in this film of a spoof of a buddy cop blockbuster. Simon Pegg plays a London police officer that is so good at his job that he is forced to transfer to an assignment in the country in order to no longer make the rest of the officers in London look incompetent. Once in the country he is paired off with Nick Frost who plays a sad sack of the little village's police force who only has his job because his father is the chief of police.<br /><br />For a spoof this is a well-produced action adventure film. They have made good use of their bigger budget and this films R-rating comes from strong language. Even so this is fun to watch as the action picks up in the small and idyllic village of Sandford. A series of murders start Pegg's character investigating them though all others in the village believe they are just a series of accidents.<br /><br />There are many clich&eacute;s and homage's to other films, they are so numerous I could not possible list them. You will also see and hear references to their previous movie, SHAUN OF THE DEAD. Watch the movie and try to keep track of them. A funny spoof filled with action and worth watching.</p></body></html>

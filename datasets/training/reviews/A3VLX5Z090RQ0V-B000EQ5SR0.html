<meta name="summary" content="Suprisingly, it's not as "fluxxed" as I though it'd be..."></head><body><p>...and I'm saying that as a positive thing, not a literal meaning to the term.<br /><br />- REVIEW<br /><br />Hey, you!  Yea, you!  Are you one of those people that seen the previews of "Aeon Flux" and thinking, "Woah!  This movie's so gonna suck; I mean, "Catwoman" suck"?  Well, my unseen random consumer...I cannot blame you: the concept looks awkward, the stunts are glorified, and Theron's costume screams out "blech!".  My thoughts haven't changed, but within 700 words, my thoughts will render how this 1-star predicted disaster convert into a shocking 3-star entertaining romp.<br /><br />With 1-star on my mind, I have to grasp into the story, which is about as comprehensible as Dubya Bush making his speech.  In about 7 years from now, 99% of the Earth's pop is dead from a virus...possibly from the avian flu.  Those that survived are on scientific notice, and one Trevor Goodchild conducted a cure that will purity the remains...sort of.  All I know is that 400 years into the future, one 'psychedechnical' (Psychedelic meets Technical) city holds the survivors under control of the Goodchild regime, runned by the same guy who cured them 400 years ago (???).  But the rebels against the regime's reign continues to weaking his power, though the territorial rebels are destroying for the good, as the regime are really hostile that often kills certain civilians that might corrupt the nation's premise.  In other words: Government = bad; "bad guys" = good.  Only one Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron), a high-ranked fighter of the rebels, has the strength to take down something as confusing as the regime.<br /><br />So, Ms. Theron here fights the government wearing clothes that ranges from "Awful" to "Not awful like the last one", although I doubt Theron would degrade herself to wear the old revealing get-up the original femme fatale wore on the animated show.<br /><br />Anyway, the "future" remains uncertain, and by uncertain, I mean I have no idea how anything I see in this film work.  How did Aeon's weapons work, how do the futuristic security system function, how is swallowing some pill got Aeon get in touch with the leader of the rebels from her mind, and what are the foods these people are eating?  It seems as though the movie just goes into the future setting without any hint of social explanation.  At least the producers kept the atmosphere in spirit of the original series, along with its intended characters and premise.  And as long as you can tolerate some of the actors goofy one-liners, the characters act well, and Theron is a good Aeon, which is why the star went up a pound.<br /><br />Another pick-er-upper is the fact that the movie has layers, albeit layers done very sloppy.  As Aeon confrots Trevor to assassinate in a vengeful manner, as she should, a revelation occurs when love and secluded past memories affected her way of thinking.  Neither had killed each other, which resulted in a backlash between the regime and rebels.  That's when the good part sets in, as many mysteries of the film (but not all) have been revealved that deals with the past, the search for a cure, and cloning.  Now, she and Trevor alone are on their own mission to find a solution to the nation's problem, while getting away from the regime who not only considered them as fugitives, but so has the rebels who now wants to kill Aeon.<br /><br />"Aeon Flux" is not so bad, I was really surprised.  The abrupt and incohesive premise should've been dealt with more "flux"-iblilty, but the fact remains: it's not boring, it had some cool action scenes, and it had a solid story as it progresses.  As long as you don't think of this as Theron's big hit like "Monster" or "North Country", this film will give you a decent time.<br /><br />This is Del Keyes, saying "At least it's better than that Tomb Raider film."</p></body></html>

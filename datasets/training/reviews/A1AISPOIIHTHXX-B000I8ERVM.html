<meta name="summary" content="Very creepy but couple problems"></head><body><p>Many horror films lately are built so that it uses disorienting camera trickery and loud music jolts and call it a horror film. Many well done ones were more about atmosphere and tension. This film does have it where you feel slightly unnerved and not extremely calm although as a film it might have certain elements you may not like.<br /><br />Based on a true story, the story tells of Emily Rose, a 19 year old college student who died. The main suspect is Father Moore, who disallowed any medical or hospitalization of Emily. Why? Well it's believed that she is the carrier of a demon and a victim of possession. After a failed exorcism she turns up dead so was it his fault or something else entirely? Well I might as well say it now, the film doesn't answer this and I bet it was designed so it wouldn't.<br /><br />I always find it funny that Muslims, Buddhists and Catholics will so strongly believe in a higher power(naturally God or Jesus Christ or Allah) and yet we completely shoot down any possibility or demons or creatures. We're interested in the stars and possible planets capable of supporting life yet we find aliens and UFO phenomenons absolute sci-fi nerd nonsense. So when the prosecutor mentions he's a man of faith, we go "you believe in one higher power but not the other?"<br /><br />The film doesn't really rely on shock tactics like Boogeyman or Amityville Horror remake but it relies mainly on mood. In other words, the filmmakers are trying to mess with your head and leave you uneasy and it's quite effective. There is a couple jump scenes as I call them but they're few and far between.<br /><br />Performance-wise is straight across the board(except for whoever played the prosecutor. His cry baby objections get grating). Laura Linney is always reliable, being a very versatile actress and Tom Wilkinson, last seen playing a mob boss in Batman Begins is effective as Father Moore. In particular mention is Jennifer Carpenter playing our unfortunate title character. A lot of her performance is for real and that makes it more chilling and quite a lung power on her.<br /><br />Where the film falls on its face is where information is told to us in periodic moments so something new shows up. The 3 AM thing shows up but it's not explained until way later. Even certain keywitness are ignored. One particular witness is never even called who witnessed the exorcism. You can see the filmmakers intent to drum up curiousity and makes us question things but since speculation runs rampant on whether it's a science explanation or a matter of faith, many events are just standing there without us figuring out where to put our mind.<br /><br />If you want a genuine film that'll creep you out, can't go wrong here. I'm not buying it since it's not my taste but guys, if you're renting this so your woman can cling to you you might just cling back.</p></body></html>

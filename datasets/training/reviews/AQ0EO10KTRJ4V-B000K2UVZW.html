<meta name="summary" content="Collapses after a great start"></head><body><p>We had heard all the criticism of this film, but being lovers of 1930-1940 era stories, we decided to give it our own try.<br /><br />During the first 30 minutes, we were saying to ourselves.... "Hey this is really good, what is all the criticism about ?"<br /><br />BUT........ then it hit..... at the 31 minute mark the film hit a brick wall, fell apart and became a burden of chaotic boredom to watch.<br /><br />At 88 minutes we finally gave up and hit EJECT !<br /><br />Summary..  Excellent 40's era sets and costumes.... a great moody atmosphere.<br /><br />Weakness = story, pacing, character development.</p></body></html>

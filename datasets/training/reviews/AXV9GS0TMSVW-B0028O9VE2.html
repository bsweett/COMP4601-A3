<meta name="summary" content="Understated gem"></head><body><p>Perhaps one of the great travesties of a film like this is the failure in marketing.  James L. Brooks makes serious movies that have a few laughs.  If we zoom in on his past films, we see the heavy detail given to the characters.  Spanglish is a character piece with some very obvious themes.  It's not very funny, but it's not supposed to be.  Fans of Sandler's slapstick comedy may be a bit taken by the understated performance here.  Moreover, they might be surprised by the fact that he isn't the "star," as previews might suggest.  Rather, this is an ensemble piece driven by Paz Vega, who plays a Mexican immigrant who works as a housekeeper for Sandler's family in the film. Vega is brilliant, but Sandler quietly steals the show in a performance that shows his range as an actor.  He's neither comedic, as he is in comedies like "Big Daddy" or "The Wedding Singer," or terribly manic, as he was in the quirky comic-drama "Punch Drunk Love."  Rather, his performance is understated, honest, and very precise, as a hard-working father trying to find peace within his family.<br /><br />The film's success relies heavily on how the characters play off each other, especially to Vega, whose entrance into the lives of everyone around her affect them and her.  It is about the communication or lack thereof between the characters.  Brooks brilliantly illustrates that language, in the literal sense, does not neccessarily equate with successful communication.  It's also not the only way to communicate effectively.  Brooks drives the point home in a very moving scene between Sandler and Vega and in the ending that may dissapoint some viewers.  It should at least illicit some discussion.<br /><br />The film's only failure is only in what people may make it out to be.  It is, in contrast to what many viewers may see, not about the experience of Mexican in a foreign society.  While there are scenes that illustrate the displacement of cultures, the film is more interested in the idea that culture is important in terms of honesty and showing who you truly are.  Some have criticized this film as white washing the Mexican American experience, and while the film is not an ideal illustration, that's not what it intends to be.  These aspects merely serve as a springboard for a film that has much  bigger ideas that speak to a much broader audience, whatever langauge they speak.</p></body></html>

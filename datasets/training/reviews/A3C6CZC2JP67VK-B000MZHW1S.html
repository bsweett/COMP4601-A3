<meta name="summary" content="Performances give "Diamond" its luster"></head><body><p>A rare and sizable diamond is found by a worker in a warlord's diamond mine. This adds even more turbulence to an already volatile situation as different forces attempt to seize the 'blood diamond.'<br /><br />In a certain sense I found this film to comparable to 'Babel' - it tells s story that reveals an uncomfortable truth about our world, but remains grounded and personal with its perspective. Focusing of a few principle characters - with each actor/actress giving a solid performance - the film gives a really up-close look at a world fueled by greed and filled with violence. There is something rotten in the states of Africa and the 'blood diamond' of the title is practically a classic McGuffin - totally incidental to what is going on. But if people can get so worked up over just one diamond it gives you an idea about why the situation there is what it is - and just how expensive diamonds really are.<br /><br />Leonrado DiCaprio done an excellent job in his role-no exaggeration. He excels as the aggressive and also at times sensitive smuggler.  2006 has been exceptional year for him with two powerhouse roles - the other being "The Departed" - and his career should be highly respected for that. Djimon Honsou is one of my favorite actors, so, naturally, I liked his work in this. But it isn't that I simply "liked" his work in this--he gave THE best performance in the movie. He handles the role of Solomon Vandy as if he IS Solomon- a truly moving character. I think this is Jennifer Connelly's second best performance in her career (the first being Requiem For A Dream). She plays Matty Bowen, journalist for Vital Affairs magazine. She shows how great an actress she can actually be, but it will never top her Requiem acting.<br /><br />As Richard Roeper stated: "Edward Zwick is the master of politically correct thrillers". Well, I wholeheartedly agree with him. "Glory," "The Last Samaurai," and "The Siege" were spectacular and suspenseful pictures with great acting, and I'm going to chalk this up onto that list as well. There are some great action set pieces that had me on the edge of my seat. But Zwick and cinematographer Eduardo Serra make it look easy. "Blood Diamond" is violent, gritty, suspenseful, poignant, and long which is why it is worth your time.</p></body></html>

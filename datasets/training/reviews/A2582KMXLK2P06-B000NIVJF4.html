This is when the storyline really began to pick up and catch my interest.  Forest Whitaker's acting performance was about as great as always.  It's a movie you really should watch, if you can find the patience to sit through a pretty boring build up in the beginning.  You should also know that a large part of the story is about a doctor from Scotland who becomes close to Forest's character. It's not all about Forest Whitaker as the king- there's more to it than that.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What type of movie is it? A boring one."></head><body><p>I really wanted to see this in theatres and never got the chance, so I finally have seen the movie and am not sure what to think.  I was expecting something that was maybe a little Romeo & Juliet with the Vampire vs. Werewolf thing going on, but I don't know.  This movie really didn't pay any homage to old Vampire/Werewolf mythology, it didn't really have much action, and the Romeo & Juliet thing is not really expressed and there's only one kiss between the two main people.  Kate Beckinsale is alright as the main Vampire, but Scott Speedman (you may have seen him in Dark Blue, an excellent movie) really doesn't have much to add to the film, and was sort of a waste.  I thought the Vampire Werewolf hypbrid would be kind of cool, but the transformation was alot cooler than the end result which looked like a guy painted gray with sharp teeth and claws, very creative.  The end result of this movie was a boring anticlimactic piece that is something like The Matrix was, starting its own trilogy, which is what I think they're doing.  It really has nothing new to offer now that Blade has shown us another view of Vampires, and it sure as heck isn't funny.  I can't really say you won't like it, but I can't say you will either.</p></body></html>

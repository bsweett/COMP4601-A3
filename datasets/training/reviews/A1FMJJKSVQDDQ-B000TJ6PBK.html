<meta name="summary" content="One of the more effective horror films to have been released in the new millennium"></head><body><p>NOTE: This review contains MAJOR SPOILERS<br /><br />A specific hotel room in the Dolphin Hotel, New York, has become a breeding ground for disaster. In Room 1408, people have killed either themselves or other people through the ages, for no apparent reason whatsoever. The staff has since abandoned not only the room, but the entire floor as well (the thirteenth). Nobody is allowed on the thirteenth floor unless someone is supposed to be, such as maids or janitors. Mike Enslin (Cusack) is a skeptic writer who specializes on paranormal activities, and he wants to know if 1408 really is a hellhole or if the murders are powered by false superstition. The manager of the hotel (Jackson) warns him about the dangers of staying in Room 1408 for about one hour, but Enslin doesn't budge. As soon as he finds himself in Room 1408, bad things happen, of course. And this is when his own beliefs on the paranormal are drastically challenged.<br /><br />This is one of the more effective (and intelligent) horror films that I've recently seen. When other horror films rely on blood, gore, and whiny teenage girls, "1408" relies more on atmosphere and psychological effects. There are a few jump scares here and there, but they're actually done pretty well. This also has a more mature tone: this is the kind of horror film that is suited more for adults than for teenagers and kids. I'm sure several teenagers enjoy this, too, but I do think that this movie is primarily for adults. The one problem I had with the movie was when Enslin is convinced that his stay at the hotel was only a dream. This scene is situated very late in the film, right before he realizes that he is still in the hotel, and it's somewhat annoying, considering that the "dream sequence" is an old and tired gimmick that we've seen many times before. I know that we as the viewer are supposed to believe that it's not a dream at all, but it's done far too well as it looks and feels a bit too predictable. This is my only gripe, however, as everything else in the movie works.<br /><br />Now, I want to talk about the ending to this movie. The alternate ending (the one that's on the DVD) has been fairly criticized for its more depressing outcome. I think the criticisms are unjust, because I feel that this ending is far superior to the original theatrical ending. I have seen both endings, and, in my opinion, the alternate is more effective compared to the theatrical. I don't want it to be conventional. I don't like it when these particular horror films have a typical happy ending, where all the problems are solved with a feel-good attitude. With this alternate ending, it challenges you by going against your emotions and making you think of the consequences that you have just seen on the screen. Also, to me, this ending fits more to the entire movie. Enslin sacrificing himself to prevent his estranged wife from being 1408's next victim shows that he really changed. In the past, he has made some selfish decisions before his daughter's death. Even though he does lose his life in the end, he realizes that he has one last chance to redeem himself, and he accepts it despite a few consequences.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of the better horror films to have come out in the year 2007, and I even think that it surpasses some other horror films in the present. Keep in mind, this is not as excellent as The Exorcist or The Shining, but it's pretty close.<br /><br />Grade: A-</p></body></html>

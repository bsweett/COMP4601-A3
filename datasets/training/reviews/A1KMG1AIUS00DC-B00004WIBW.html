<meta name="summary" content="Ichabod Crane Revisited"></head><body><p>SLEEPY HOLLOW  (1999), starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Casper Van Dien, and Jeffrey Jones, combines horror, suspense, and comedy brilliantly.  This is a loosely adapted version of Washington Irving's &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.&quot;  Depp plays a bumbling constable who relies upon the latest scientific methods to figure out who is responsible for a series of beheadings in New York's Hudson valley.  Directed by Tim Burton, the film looks terrific with exquisite sets and evocative cinematography.  If Burton takes liberties with the Irving classic, he succeeds in creating a superior black comedy with his distinctive trademark.  And look for a surprise cameo in the role of the Headless Horseman.</p></body></html>

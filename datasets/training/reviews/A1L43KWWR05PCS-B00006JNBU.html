<meta name="summary" content="A HEAVENLY SPOOF..."></head><body><p>This is a funny, well executed spoof of the popular nineteen seventies series by the same name. At times, it is positively hilarious. Cameron Diaz showcases her comedic talents and is a standout. With that luminescent smile and perfect comedic timing, she is reminiscent of a young Goldie Hawn. The ever lovely and voluptuous bad girl, Drew Barrymore, is also very funny, as is the petite Lucy Liu. The droll Bill Murray is likewise perfect, and with the addition of John Forsythe, who played the original Charlie in the series, reprising his original role, the casting is flawless.<br /><br />While the plot is, as it is with all spoofs, silly, it is, nonetheless, action packed and highly entertaining. Its tongue in cheek action scenes, as well as the sheer campiness of the movie, keep the viewer engaged. For sheer enjoyment, watch this film. You will not be disappointed.</p></body></html>

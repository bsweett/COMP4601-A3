<meta name="summary" content="A thrill ride with jaw-dropping effects and battle scenes."></head><body><p>Starship Troopers could honestly use a few more likeable characters and a more convincing lead, but otherwise, this is as thrilling as movies come, a lightning-paced, hilarious rollercoaster ride of bullets, explosions, gore, raucous humor, and gratuitous nudity.  So yes, this is my kind of film, and I relished every minute of it.<p>Troopers is set sometime in the unnamed future, where South American society is apparently dominated by white, blandly attractive teens with Spanish last names, but look and sound distinctly American.  The whole things plays like a big satire on fasicism, as these teens graduate from high school and sign up as citizens.  Unlucky for them, signing up is almost a guaranteed death warrant, now that the humans have declared war on the Klendathu aliens from a distant star system, giant insectoid creatures that apparently feast on human flesh (once the soldiers get there, that is).  Thus, the movie chronicles the adventures of one such platoon, led by Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien), who's assisted by pals Dizzy Flores (Dina Meyer) and Ace Levy (Jake Busey).  Massive chaos ensues.<p>A lot of people I know see this as a stupid movie.  An equally large amount of other people I know see this as a brilliant satire.  Both can nitpick or examine whatever stupidities or issues they want, I merely see this as a remarkable thrill ride.  On a pure popcorn level, Starship Troopers is easily one of the best sci-fi action films of the 90's (perhaps behind only Jurassic Park and Star Trek: First Contact), so deft as it is at blending action and comedy.<p>Oh, yes, Starship Troopers is a very funny movie, for all the right reasons, too.  The first hour is relatively sparse in action (actually, virtually none at all unless you count that over-the-top football game), but it's more than made up for by the first-rate humor.  Definitely the standout segment must be the training camp scenes, which manages to outdo Full Metal Jacket when it comes to sheer brutality and certainly surpasses it in dark, morbid humor.<p>The first half also nicely plays the introduction of our lead characters, some of whom make an impression and a lot of whom don't.  Casper Van Dien, the vapid, lantern-jawed actor that he is, is most certainly not a good actor, and while I could have gone with a more convincing lead, at least he does well during the action sequences.  Denise Richards is equally vapid as one-half of his love interest.  Faring far better is Dina Meyer, who's kick-... turn as Dizzy is a lot of fun.  Too bad she exits the film too early.  The adult cast is fun, too, especially Clancy Brown as the sadistic, yet caring Drill Sergeant Zim.<p>But Starship Troopers ultimately succeeds because of its action, and what magnificent action it is.  The second hour is like strapping yourself into a rollercoaster.  We're treated to harrowing, Zulu-style battle sequences in which our heroes are surrounded at all sides from ferocious, unstoppable enemies.  The action is blistering, bloody, and appropriately over-the-top.  It's from Paul Verhoeven, would you expect any different?  <p>Starship Troopers succeeds because it's great fun, boosted by awesome special effects and a great score from Basil Poledouris.  I'd sure love to see a sequel, but judging from the box office take, such an option may never see the light of day.  Still, a must see for action fans.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Going Downhill Fast"></head><body><p>I have been a Spider-Man fan since the early 1980's and have been excited as each of these movies has come out.  They are not 100% true to the comics, but generally that is ok.  Until this one.<br /><br />They have painted themselves into a corner.  With too many villains, no where to go with the love angle, so another girl must be found-at least for awhile-and trying to explore Peter's "bad boy" side, while the minor characters have their own issues to explore, which just muddies the water even more.<br /><br />It is too much to do well, and they do not do it well.  The fights and graphics are well done and the individual characters are done well within their own scope of the movie.  The cameo of Stan Lee was a riot.  But I finished this movie feeling very disappointed.  They can't cram 40 years of Spider-Man into one movie and should not even try.</p></body></html>

The movie tells the story of the Corleone family, one of the Five Families in New York City.  Headed by Don Vito Corleone, the family must survive in the changing times after World War II as the drug industry begins to spread in America.  The Godfather must try and hold his family and empire together against the other mafia families, but also against his own family.  This movie has become an important part of American pop culture for good reason.  The movie is full of great characters, fantastic one-liners, the instantly recognizable theme, and the  still alarming violence.  This is a great movie that should not be missed by movie fans everywhere.  <p>  Marlon Brando fully deserved his Academy Award for his performance as Vito Corleone, the head of the powerful Corleone family in NYC.  This was also the movie to skyrocket Al Pacino to the top as Michael Corleone who takes charge of the family when everything begins to go wrong.  The impressive cast includes James Caan as the hot-tempered Sonny, Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, Richard Castellano as Clemenza, Diane Keaton as Kay Adams, and Sterling Hayden as corrupt cop, Captain McCluskey.  The movie also stars John Marley, Abe Vigoda, Al Lettieri, Talia Shire, and Richard Conte.  The DVD offers a great-looking widescreen presentation and commentary from director Francis Ford Coppola.  Releasing the movie like this without the second two movies in the series was a great idea.  The other two movies are good, but nowhere near as good as the original Godfather.  For one of the best movies ever to come out of Hollywood, check out The Godfather!</p></body></html>

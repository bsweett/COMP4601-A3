<meta name="summary" content="Border Wars come to Wyoming"></head><body><p>"Unforgiven" is a deconstruction of the classical Western.  There are no 'good guys', only different degrees of wrong.  The killings aren't idealized.  They are the filthy business that murder always is.  Eastwood's character, Muny, is a man with a troubled past.  He was a border raider in Kansas and Missouri during the Civil War although we never learn which side he was on.  All we know is that he was brutalized and committed atrocities.  His wife, however, tried to set him straight and he makes his life as a poor and simple farmer.<br /><br />Temptation comes to him in the form of bounty money offerred for the killing of men who cut and scarred a prostitue in Little Whiskey, Wyoming.  The prostitutes couldn't get the law to arrest the culprits so they have raised money and, in so doing, they have taken the law into their own hands.  Muny, at the urging of a very young, very inexperienced wannabe gunfighter, complies.  The result is a series of brutal killings with one culprit shot to death while sitting in an outhouse.<br /><br />The local sheriff, Little Bill, is, himself, a sadistic man and exacts retribution on Muny's little gang.  Muny, all veneer of civilization now completely stripped away, exacts bloody vengeance.  It's all so very satisfying which, I'm afraid, speaks volumes about our basic human nature.<br /><br />This is, in my opinion, an excellent film.  Clintwood, as director, shows that his attitudes about who we are may very well parallel those of Sam Peckinpah, as in 'Pat Garret and Billy the Kid' and 'The Wild Bunch.'<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite author of novels--"Skull Rack" and "Hummingbird God"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico</p></body></html>

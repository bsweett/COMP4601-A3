<meta name="summary" content="Don't mess with a missionary man"></head><body><p>This is sort of a "Road Warrior" meets "Left Behind," with some "Cyborg" thrown in.  Mr. Washington is framed perfectly by the self-conscious cinematography and directing.  Some would go so far as to call them clich&eacute;d but I would call them iconic.  The writing is sloppy in parts* but the theme of duty, devotion and love of God powers through the rough patches.  Recommended.<br /><br />* E.g., SPOILER ALERT how does Mr. Washington escape from his jail cell or Solara escape from the cave or survive the crash of the Road Warrior vehicle when everyone else dies; how is it that Mr. Washington has been traveling west for 30 years but never made it to San Francisco?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Some very gross stuff, not much of a story"></head><body><p>Oh, I get that this is really a metaphor about the working class getting back the wealthy and powerful who don't care how the other half lives.  It just isn't done very effectively. There is very little story and not much characterization either.<br /><br />The effects are truly grossly spectacular, though, especially when the zombies are chowing down on those still living.<br /><br />I recommend the remake of Dawn of the Dead and the original Night of the Living Dead, as well as Zombieland and Shaun of the Dead, if you really want to see a good zombie movie.</p></body></html>

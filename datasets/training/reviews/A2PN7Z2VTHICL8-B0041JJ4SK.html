Along the lines of 'Dude, Where's My Car', this little sleeper comedy had me laughing so hard I almost split.<br /><br />Harold and Kumar are roommates.  After toking up, they decide they want the perfect food and head out to go to White Castle burgers.  (Anybody besides me remember White Castle?  Nastiest burgers in the world!)  Harold has work to do, having a project dumped on him at quitting time by a co-worker.  Kumar, after making a mess of one interview for med school, has another interview set up by his father for 10AM the following morning.  But nothing will stop these two from reaching the perfect food.<br /><br />Their night turns into one mishap after another, tollbooths, cheetahs, a gang of 'Extreme' skateboarders, a crazy Burger Shack employee, a racist cop, a jail breakout, a Princeton party, two pretty girls with bad bathroom habits, Doogie Houser MD (Neil Patrick Harris), and a crazy, boil-infested tow truck driver named Freakshow.<br /><br />John Cho as Harold and Kal Penn as Kumar both display an amazing talent with their characters, even if this movie will never be up for an Academy Award, and my hat goes off to Neil Patrick Harris for his ability to make fun of himself and have some fun while doing it.  Special mention, though, must be given to Christopher Meloni who plays Freakshow. ("Who wants the first reach around?") Meloni proves that no matter how disgusting the character, its important to play it well, and he does so with humor and revolting finesse.<br /><br />Don't miss out on the fantasy scenes either, Kumar's involving falling in love with, and marrying, a bag of weed, and Harold's involving a Chow Yun-Fat/Zorro type encounter with Maria, the girl of his dreams.<br /><br />'Harold And Kumar Go To White Castle' is a silly and pointless comedy with no value whatsoever except to entertain you and make you laugh, and that it will.  While off color, the humor is still sharp, and the pace is just right to keep your stomach hurting all the way through the movie.  I recommend that you pick up the Unrated Extended Edition, or you will miss out on a lot of the better scenes.  Definitely a 'Purchase'.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

"Ben-Hur" is a Biblical epic that stands far above other movies of the genre, primarily because it doesn't moralize and treat its characters as saints.  The characters are not perfect, not immune to temptation and vengeance, and not one-dimensional.  The film also had the benefit of veteran director William Wyler, balancing the film's action sequences with the personal story of Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston), a member of the family of Judea, who rebels against their state of virtual slavery under Roman rule.<br /><br />Based on Lew Wallace's best-selling novel, Karl Tunberg's screenplay presented flesh-and-blood characters and plenty of melodrama to keep viewers involved.  Heston, who won the Best Actor Academy Award, dominates the three-and-a-half hour epic as Ben-Hur wins the love of Hebrew maiden Esther (Haya Harareet), is adopted by Roman consul Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins), and becomes a slave of a sheik (Hugh Griffith) who matches Ben-Hur in a chariot race against his former friend, now enemy -- the cruel and ambitious Roman, Messala (Stephen Boyd).<br /><br />"Ben-Hur" required 100,000 costumes, 15,000 extras and a $15 million budget -- the costliest in MGM's history.  The movie was filmed in a process known as MGM Camera 65, one of the widest prints ever made, with a width almost three times its height.  This allowed for spectacular panoramic shots and exciting action sequences.<br /><br />The chariot race sequence in the Circus Maximus is breathtaking.  It was constructed on over 18 acres of backlot space at Cinecitta Studios outside Rome, and the filming took five weeks.  With the exception of two of the most spectacular stunts, Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd did all their own chariot driving in the meticulously choreographed sequence.<br /><br />"Ben-Hur" won 11 Academy Awards, a record that held for 38 years until "Titanic" won a similar number.  The three-disc Blu-ray box set contains a newly remastered and restored print, the 1925 silent version of "Ben-Hur," screen tests, vintage newsreels, 64-page production art book, replica of Heston's journal and sketches, one-hour making-of featurette, highlights from the 1960 Academy awards ceremony, and the new documentary, "Charlton Heston & Ben-Hur: A Personal Journey."</p></body></html>

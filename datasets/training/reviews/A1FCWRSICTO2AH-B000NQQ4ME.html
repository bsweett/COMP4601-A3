Obsessed director, gimmicky idea regarding a lost culture and scripted in another dead language (see Passion of the Christ).  Boy, was I wrong.  Apocalypto, with its Lost World setting, is, if you just look at the plot, a lean and mean action film.  If you've ever seen the old Cornel Wilde flick, Naked Prey, you essentially have a good chunk of Apocalypto, as the hero, Jaguar Paw, races through the jungle, pursued by Mayans, while at home, his wife and child are in great, and growing, danger.  It's edge of your seat suspense that never lets up.  But on another level, Gibson has something to say about civilizations and how they kill themselves. The Mayan's are about as decadent and pagan (in a bad way) as it gets. There were times, as you were led through the Mayan city, that I thought this could be Mars.  It is unsettling and it is brutal, right down to the colors and clothing of the Mayans.  If a civilization can become demonic, certainly this one, as portrayed by Gibson, was.  The sacrifice scenes could easily come out of the Old Testament, the god being worshipped: Baal. And underscoring that is a little girl's prophet-like condemnation, that upsets the Mayan soldiers.  They themselves sense something is in the air, a bad moon is on the rise.  Spiraling out from this is a landscape that is denuded by poor usage, while plague gnaws at the edges of the Mayan world.  Yes, it is a movie set in the past, but one can't help thinking that Gibson is projecting this vision on the here and now.  It's a short leap from a world where heads are being tossed down temple steps, to one where beheadings can be viewed on the internet.</p></body></html>

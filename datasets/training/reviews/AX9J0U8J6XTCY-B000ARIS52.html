I WAS A FOOL-IT IS A GREAT ENTERTAINMENT, WITH BRILLIANT ACTING BY THE ENTIRE CAST, GREAT DIRECTION BY ROBERTO RODRIGUEZ, WITH BRILLIANT CINEMATOGRAPHY UTILIZING COLOR MIXED WITH GREAT BLACK AND WHITE! TALK ABOUT YOUR NOIR FILMS-THIS RANKS ALL THE WAY UP THERE WITH THE BEST. THE DVD IS BARE, EXCEPT FOR THE BRILLIANT, HILARIOUS, SHOCKING FILM, BUT THE MOVIE WAS ALL I NEEDED! THE DTS SOUND WAS REMARKEABLE AS WELL. LOVE IT OR HATE IT, YOU MUST SEE SIN CITY-YOU CANNOT HELP BUT BE ENTHRALLED AND ENTERTAINED FROM BEGINNING TO END.  BRAVO....................</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Mann's Best, but not Tom's."></head><body><p>not to say tom's performance isnt good, but he was better in last samurai, why do people love him in this, and not Samurai, that was an oscar caliber performance, this is a golden globe.  Foxx was good too, but i dont think he'll get a oscar nod either, the rest of the cast does well too.  The story is interesting and has many meanings, its well shot and realistic, its intense on the mind and heart (not heartwrenchingly dramatic like Passion of the christ, but still sad), the action is realistic but nothing new, its more of a charater movie (not a bad thing when you make them correctly like this, but the performances could have been just a smidge better),  the music is also very good esspecially the audioslave song and the one techno song during the club scene, and the score.  Overall a well crafted entertaining film, i recommend heat if you like this, its manns only other good film, ali was dissapointing excepts for wills performance, i hope mann stays with crime dramas that is what he is good at.  9 out of a 10.</p></body></html>

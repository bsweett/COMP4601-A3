<meta name="summary" content="Suspense-filled Civil War Mystery Resolved in Saharan Mali"></head><body><p>Action-packed adventure from beginning to end  ... includes the swash-buckling modern super hero, Dirk Pitt, played by Matthew McConnaughy, his side kick, partner and friend from childhood, Al Giordino, and the intelligent and alluring, Dr. Eva Rojas, played by Penelope Cruz. They meet in Lagos, Nigeria and travel together to the Saharan desert country of Mali to solve a couple of mysteries: the disappearance of an iron ship from the Civil War and a mysterious plague which is killing many African citizens.<br /><br />Dirk Pitt had received a gold coin from an African antique collector which dates back to the Civil War leading him to negotiate to use a power boat for exactly 72 hours. It is owned by his boss who is head of an underwater search team,, NUMA, that looks for "lost treasure". He is alloted exactly 72 hours to use the boat. His goal is to discover the origin of the gold coin. Instead he finds himself in the midst of a major civil conflict in Mali ... where a local warlord Kazim, is allowing waste to be dumped into the Niger River which has underground tributaries. The contaminated river water seeps underground ... becomes available as drinking water in wells. One must view the film to discover how Dr. Eva Rojas and Dirk Pitt become partners in solving two separate mysteries ... and how they become romantic partners as well.<br /><br />This film captured my imagination from the start ... first, by showing a Civil War scene where the Iron ship is docked and makes its escape into the Atlantic Ocean in April 1865 ... never to be seen, heard from or discovered. And second, by the opening scenes where a camera scans the office of Dirk Pitt ... showing photos, newspaper clippings, and model ships from the past. This introduction was only the foretaste of the great cinematography which was so evident throughtout this film. The film lasted 2 and 1/2 hours and I loved every minute of it! The Sahara scenes of Dirk Pitt and Eva Rojas riding on camel's backs ... with the sun setting behind them ... the camels undulating as they walked on sand dunes ... superb creative photography. The scene where Dirk, Al, and Eva reach a mountain pass ... stop their jeep ... drop all their weapons one by one ... raise their hands ... in anticipation of being captured by desert tribes is very powerful and effective, again, among the best scenes in the film. When they arrive at the mountain village, where the homes are carved on the side of the mountain, like old style condominiums, unbelievably beautiful. The monumental discovery by Al in the cave ... The adventure/escape fighting scenes on the Niger River, as Kazim's soldiers try to stop Dirk and his pals ... hair raising, seat of the edge tense moments, took my breath away. Most appealing is the train-ride in the desert to get to Yves Mossard's waste factory in the desert ... the cinematography was over-whelmingly superb. Building a wind-driven dune buggy out of a downed airplane (hahaha, loved it!). There are other great scenes throughout the film but to describe them would ruin the plot ...<br /><br />This is the first Clive Cussler novel I have viewed with the action-hero Dirk Pitt on film. Matthew McConnaughy lives and breathes the part, his personality fits perfectly into the character. Penelope Cruz was another perfect cast for the role of Dr. Eva Rojas. My prediction is: this may be the first in a series of multi-million dollar making films, similar to the Indian Jones series. Make another film from a Clive Cussler book: I promise! I will be there! This is among the best (likley THE BEST) action/adventure/mystery film I have seen in recent memory (past 5 years). Erika Borsos (erikab93)</p></body></html>

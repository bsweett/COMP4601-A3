<meta name="summary" content="Tim Burton's Visually Stunning and Curiouly Endearing Love Story"></head><body><p>Visually stunning and curiously endearing 'Corpse Bride' is another proof that traditional stop-motion animations, if given good amount of originality, can be as imaginatie and entertaining as Pixar animations.  (I said 'another' because there is Aardman and its Wallace & Gromit.)  I don't say 'Corpse Bride' is better than 'Nightmare Before Christmas' of which visual and musical innovation is still to be surpassed.  But the fact doesn't change that I enjoyed thoroughly watching 'Corpse Bride' its wry graveyard humor included.<br /><br />[IT'S A LOVE STORY] Incredible you might think, but 'Corpse Bride' is a love story, which involves three characters -- Victor, Victoria, and "Corpse Bride."  Victor is to marry Victoria he never met because his parents want status, and her parents need money.  This is a typically melodramatic situation, but a clever twist is given.  It turns out that Victoria is a nice girl, with whom Victor fell in love at first sight.<br /><br />But because of the ill-judged rehearsal of his wedding vow, Victor gives his ring to a wrong woman, who is actually dead and buried in the dark forest.  She is the Corpse Bride, who gleefully brings the bridegroom to her hometown in the land of the dead, where the dead people are leading much, much joyful life.  And a dead dog too.<br /><br />Few people can think of such an idea, and fewer people are talented enough to realize this macbre idea.  Tim Burton and Mike Johnson did this job brilliantly, with so much visual delight and occasional wry humor.  Voice cast is also perfect, including Johnny Depp (as Victor who uncannily resembles Depp), Helena Bonham Carter (as Corpse Bride), Emily Watson (as Victoria).  You can hear the voice of Albert Finney, Tracy Ullman, Paul Whitehouse, Joanna Lumley, Richard E. Grant, Jane Horrocks, and of course, Danny Elfman who also provided the score for the film.  And Burton's favorite actors legendary Christopher Lee and Michael Gough are also to be heard.  What a cast!<br /><br />I do not say 'Corpse Bride' is perfect.  You might disagree with me, but Danny Elfman's music is not as impressive as that of 'Nightmare' and some part of the film is CGI-processed, which might have lessened the charms of the traditional stop-motion animation.  CGIs often make everything too smooth for me, and usually, much beloved Ray Harryhausen animation is not associated with too smooth movement.  That's why we use this self-contradictory phrase, stop-motion.<br /><br />Probably this is part of Tim Burton's vast world of imagination when he was a boy, which later produced 'Frankenweenie.'  It was 21 years ago, and Burton has got older since then, but 'Corpse Bride' shows that he has not lost his imagination.</p></body></html>

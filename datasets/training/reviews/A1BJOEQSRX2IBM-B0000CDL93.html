<meta name="summary" content="Powerful Filmmaking, A Riveting Film!"></head><body><p>A triumph for everyone involved. But this is Oliver Stone's picture all the way, you can clearly see that he is also obsessed with the Kennedy assassination and that's where the film gets it's passion and it's  unstoppable search for the truth. He took as a premise, the case of Jim  Garrison, the only lawyer to ever take the Kennedy assassination to court.  This is only the excuse for Stone to bombard us with fascinating and  dangerous information that may or may not be true, but we all know that  something fishy was going on. Besides being a directorial triumph it is  also a technical landmark with outstanding editing, probably among the best  ever. A terrific all-star cast bring all these characters to life. Some we  pity, others we despise and some we respect. Kevin Costner gives a  dramatically powerful and effective performance as Jim Garrison, he's got  the All-American look stamped on his face. An extremely good supporting  cast filled with heavy-hitters. Tommy Lee Jones is brilliant as Clay Shaw  (Clay Bertrand). Gary Oldman is quietly effective as the patsy himself, Lee  Harvey Oswald. Joe Pesci, Kevin Bacon and John Candy are also great. Jack  Lemmon and Walter Matthau appear in yet another film together, and both  deliver good performances. But it is Donald Sutherland's cameo as Mr. 'X'  that is really gripping, those few scenes he is in, you can't blink. A  brilliant and truly important film. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a  9!</p></body></html>

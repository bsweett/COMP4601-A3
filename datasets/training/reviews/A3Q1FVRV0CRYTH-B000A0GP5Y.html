Now I didn't even want to see this film to tell you the truth but I had free Showtime this weekend so I said "what the heck" and turned it on.  Into the movie about ten fifteen minutes and I wasn't really impressed.  Adam was pulling his same bad boy persona and the laughs where coming slow and when they came I had to force myself to laugh.  Even after Chris Rock showed up I was a bit letdown since his one-liners were clich&eacute;.  But about a half hour in the jokes felt funnier, the chemistry started to click and the film began to pick up.  I was actually impressed by the time the credits began to roll.  So, it's not a brilliant comedy by any means, and it's certainly not Sandler's best but it's a step above mediocrity and a nice diversion from a hectic day.</p></body></html>

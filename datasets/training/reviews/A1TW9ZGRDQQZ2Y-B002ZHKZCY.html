<meta name="summary" content="Even Better than the First Bourne!"></head><body><p>This is an awesome action flick that actually makes you think for a change. Matt Damon once again stars as Jason Bourne (easily his best role) and improves on the great character he portrayed in the first movie. Top notch acting work also from Brian Cox and Joan Allen, these are bad guys that were actually interesting and smart. And that car chase at the end easily eclipses the one in &quot;The Bourne Identity.&quot; This is a must see smart summer film, just judge it as a stand alone (judge the film and book seperately please). Bring on the third Bourne film soon!</p></body></html>

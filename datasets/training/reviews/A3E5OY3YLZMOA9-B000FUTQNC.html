You have Jack Stanfield (Harrison Ford) as a loving husband and father of two. Stanfield is the expert that designed the computer systems for the bank he works at, maybe it was just me but it took a while for them to tell you that he worked in a bank. So about 20 minutes into the movie the Stanfields home is invaded by men with guns and his entire life is turned around but you still don't know what the heck they want. Finally after a bunch of talk you find out that the men want Jack to help them break into the computer system he built and wire a load of cash into various accounts.<br /><br />Of course there have been plenty of movies that are just like this one with so now all this film could hope for is that the cast gives a great performance. The acting is mixed up, those criminals that broke into the Stanfields home who are supposed to be relentless are far from it and that sets the movie back. These guys were getting beaten up and outsmarted by a couple of kids the entire time. Plus the guy from Wimbledon is leading them; the kids were pushing him around like it was nothing. Harrison Ford still has it because his skills are what keep you watching. Most people will have Firewall figured out within a short time. It has a few twists in it but I would advise to just wait for it to come on cable or for one of your friends to rent it because it's really not worth buying. I give it three stars because even though it was predictable there are a couple of parts that are good and Harrison and a few others give a good performance.</p></body></html>

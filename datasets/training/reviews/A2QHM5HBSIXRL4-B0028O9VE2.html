There is a lot to like and recommend here, though.<br /><br />In general, I'm not anti-Adam Sandler, butI love how he's consistently overcome doubters throughout his career.  Here, however, though he plays it straight the entire way through, I couldn't help thinking that I was watching Adam Sandler self-consciously taking on the bigimportantserious role.  In some of the key scenes with Paz Vega, he seemed uncomfortable.<br /><br />Speaking of Ms. Vega, she's the start of the many things that are good about Spanglish.  Like many people, I'm tired of the star-making machine trying to cram Penelope Cruz down my throat.  I like Ms. Cruz as much as the next person, but that just isn't happening, Tom Cruise or no Tom Cruise.  Let's hope Ms. Vega becomes everything that Team Cruz has tried to attain.  At the very least, Ms. Vega owes Ms. Cruz a thank you for chopping down the timber in front of her.  Ms. Vega had to learn both English and Mexican-inflected Spanish for her role, so its not all natural charm and eye-popping good looks up there.<br /><br />Other delights include:<br /><br />Cloris Leachman...still a scene-stealer 40 years (!) after the Mary Tyler Moore show made her a household name.  The Executive Producer of MTM was a young James L. Brooks, showing that it never hurts to make friends and be nice to people.<br /><br />Shelbie Bruce...as Ms. Vega's daughter Cristina, she has one incredible scene in which she acts as translator between Vega and Sandler, taking on not only the words, but also the intonations, body language and passion of the original speaker.  It's the second-best scene in the movie.<br /><br />T&eacute;a Leoni...as Sandler's wife.  Ms. Leoni is this country's best physical comedienne on the big screen ('Flirting With Disaster' anyone?), and she proves it again here, with a hilarious, over-the-top, not-quite-a-sex scene, replete with jogging bra and running shoes in which Sandler is only a convenient bystander.  This one should go right up there with Meg Ryan's famous "I'll have what she's having" scene in "When Harry Met Sally."</p></body></html>

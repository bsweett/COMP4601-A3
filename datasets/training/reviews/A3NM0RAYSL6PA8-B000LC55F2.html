<meta name="summary" content="Interesting, but not moving."></head><body><p>For a movie about murder, revenge, and obsession, The Prestige is remarkably passionless. With thin characters and a thick plot, that's hardly surprising. But the cold core of The Prestige is chilled further by a story that is so mechanistic, so structured like Lego? blocks, and so populated with intellectually interesting, but unsatisfying diversions, that it simply never rises above being a series of pretty pictures and rookie chess moves.<br /><br />Is it worth seeing? To a degree. The story line is sufficiently interesting, if improbable and ultimately unsatisfying, to be a pleasant enough diversion. Despite being given so little to work with, Jackman and Bale draw you in with charisma alone, and it's nice to see Michael Caine. Scarlett Johansson, who I love, is weak, but looks great.</p></body></html>

At the very least, Star Trek Insurrection has the benefit of the doubt as to whether the bad guys stance of relocating the hippie-liberal people for medical breakthroughs could even work, as the medical miracle of the planet's atmosphere might be impossible to replicate, or impossible to distribute, or the hippie-liberal people would be willing to share it if only the wrinkly-faced bad guys would go away.<br /><br />"Star Trek Nemesis" has absolutely none of that.<br /><br />Nemesis probably had a special place in my heart somehow for being the first Star Trek movie I fully and completely remember seeing in theaters when it first came out.  I'm 70% sure I saw Insurrection in theaters, and 30% sure I saw First Contact in theaters.<br /><br />So maybe it had to take this long, or rather it had to take my maturing into an adult, and becoming a real Star Trek fan to realize the movie wasn't just a bust at the box office and franchise-killing, but was a complete mess of sheer stupidity!<br /><br />So the story is our guys pretty much have nothing to do but wait for another Borg attempt (unless Voyager ensured that wouldn't happen any time soon), and Commander Riker is about to go off with Deanna Troi on a honeymoon, then captain his own ship.  But then suddenly comes Shin-Zon, who stages a coup on the Romulan Senate and takes control of the Empire with the military's backing.<br /><br />For some reason, this is treated with a remarkable amount of hostility and uncertainty, despite the fact that the Federation and the Romulan Empire had been on hostile terms for many years, and that a sworn enemy of the Romulans had just taken over the Romulan Empire, and that this could lead to a great many new and interesting diplomatic developments between the two factions.<br /><br />Ideally it SHOULD be treated this way, but that would probably take too long, and have too much "exploring" and "negotiation" and "diplomacy" and "logic", all the things a Star Trek movie SHOULDN'T have, right?  Oh wait, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT STAR TREK IS ABOUT!  At least you'd think that from the Original Series and the movies.<br /><br />Instead, Shin-Zon is introduced and supposed to be someone to RIVAL KHAN NOONIEN SINGH in terms of sheer awe and power and evilness and such.  I have no idea of this is true, but I had heard that Rick Berman said that Shin-Zon would rival Khan, or even equal him.<br /><br />Rather than be a snotty pessimist, I will simply say that this is not possible because the writers did not even try to portray it this way, or else their attempts to do so ended up being edited out of the final script, or completely forgotten about.<br /><br />Shin-Zon is an artificial human created from Jean-Luc Picard's DNA by the Romulans.  They planned to have this clone created, rapidly aged, then inserted in Picard's place as captain of the Enterprise for some nefarious plan against the Federation.  Early on, this plan ends up being abandoned, and Shin-Zon is thrown away like garbage onto Remus, among the enslaved Remans.<br /><br />One of the Remans there takes Shin-Zon in, after seeing how he is horribly treated by the Romulan overseers.  Shin-Zon grows up in an environment of hatred of Romulans, hard work and torture.  Somehow he manages to gain ahold of much power and influence amongst the Remans, and stages a coup in which he assassinates the entire Romulan Senate, and gains power of the Empire with its military behind him.<br /><br />The vast majority of his story is over!  He can no longer be anywhere near Khan, because Khan's whole story was one that mirrored that of Captain Ahab in "Moby Dick"---a lust for revenge so overpowering, it destroyed him and everyone he held dear.  Shin-Zon achieves his revenge without losing anything, it seems.<br /><br />So here comes Jean-Luc Picard, his DNA twin, sent by the Federation to investigate, and even negotiate if possible!  He can do what has never been done before for the Romulan Empire; make a peace treaty between the Federation and the Empire that can see them united, break down the Neutral Zone, and be a powerful and dominating force together in a strong alliance!<br /><br />Instead, because arbitrary action and "Anyone who isn't a part of the Enterprise and has spooky evil music play whenever they come on-screen must be a bad guy", Shin-Zon for ABSOLUTELY NO REASON AT ALL decides he has to attack and destroy Earth and the Federation.  Brbbrbrbrb, WHY?!?! WHY?!?!? WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY?!<br /><br />There is NO REASONING OR JUSTIFICATION AT ALL for Shin-Zon to arbitrarily ATTACK THE FEDERATION just because he's a clone of Jean-Luc Picard!  HE HATES THE ROMULANS!  EVERY SINGLE MAJOR PLOT POINT AND KEY IN HIS BACKGROUND POINTS TO HIM HATING THE ROMULANS!  AND SUDDENLY HE HATES THE FEDERATION, WHY?!<br /><br />This would be as if Khan, after marooning Kirk and taking the Genesis Project, decides to go and attack the Klingon homeworld.  WHY?!<br /><br />So instead of making any sense and maybe, trying to hunt down the military elements of Romulus that DIDN'T support him, or preparing to put down attempted rebellions on Romulan colonies and territories that oppose him, or maybe trying to make sure the military is pleased with him and strongly backing him, instead of THREATENING THE ONLY GUY WHO COULD POSSIBLY QUASH YOUR NEFARIOUS PLOTS with random acts of violence for even DARING TO QUESTION HIM, Shin-Zon decides to threaten the only guy who could put an end to his life and reign, and go after Earth because Earth is good and good is dumb.<br /><br />The rest is just fudge frosting on the cake of idiocy this movie takes.  This is a true franchise-killer, and while J.J. Abrams did good in "reviving" the franchise with "Star Trek", after this mess of a movie, anyone short of Uwe Boll could have revived the franchise.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="How could this have been overlooked by the Academy????"></head><body><p>Big Fish is a terrific film that, once viewed, will leave you scratching your head as to why it was noticebly snubbed at the 2003 Academy awards.  It's GREAT, inventive, and packs an emotional wallop.<br /><br />Big Fish is the story of a family, essentially.  The father is a notorious teller of tall tales, and his son has had his fill of them.  The father is in his final days, and the son comes home at his mother's urging, hopefully to help bridge the gaps in their relationship, and to maybe help the son 'get' his father, who he can't understand.<br /><br />In typical Burton fashion, this movie has visuals that can be larger than life.  However, in context of this story, it works SO well, as the backstory for a man whose life itself may be larger than legend would have is perfect.  The set design and cinematography lend such a surreal quality to tales that may or may not be tall.  It provides a world that have just enough realism to keep the audience wondering 'Hmmm...maybe he's NOT exaggerating.'<br /><br />By far, this film is Burton's best work yet.  I've found Burton throws people into two camps, 'Love him' or 'Hate him.'  This is definitely a middle of the road Burton that can easily be watched by non-Burton fans, because the story of Father-son estrangement is universal, and Burton's storytelling gives the highly emotional subject enough whimsy to make it enjoyable, but never loses the powerful emotions of the characters and should easily move the most hardened heart with it's interesting examination of parent/child relationships.<br /><br />This really is a can't miss addition to one's collection, and I can highly recommend it to those who like films with emotional punch and stories that make you think.  An added bonus, is that you will find you need to rewatch it several times to pick up subtle nuances the tall tales tell.</p></body></html>

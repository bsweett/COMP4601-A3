<meta name="summary" content="Falls short of original...but still full of mindless fun"></head><body><p>I had high hopes after the surprisingly good 'The Mummy' became<br />an instant cult classic...but unfortunately it came up short--for me, anyway.  As far as action went, 'The Mummy Returns' certainly delivered, in fact almost too much if you ask me.  As for storyline, I liked the idea of our main couple married and<br />living comfortably in England years after the original *experience* which brought them together in the first film.  But<br />the whole Scorpion King thing left me wondering what went wrong?<br />I realize a certain amount of suspension of belief MUST be done in order to even make an attempt at enjoying these films, but<br />this one took that to the extreme--again, if you ask me.<p>My children thought it was the greatest thing EVER...and unfortunately the younger generation asks less and less of the movies they see, and therefore they seem to lack more and more<br />these days.  Some elements bothered me, including the skeletal<br />pygmies which were never explained, and how poor the ending<p>fight scene with the digitally animated Scorpion King looked overall.  Every time the focus came to the Scorpion Kings face it was a very poor representation of The Rock who played that<br />character...sure you could see the similarities, but overall it<br />looked poor.  The problem with this is that special effects these days have become SO GOOD, the bar has been raised, and if<br />something doesn't look 100% REAL, well it tends to be almost cheesy.  <p>Gripes aside, it was still worth seeing and my 9 year old daughter has it listed as her ALL-TIME favorite movie (where did I go wrong???).  Searching for a mindless load of action?  'The Mummy Returns' certainly fits the bill--and then some.  The added bonus features in this particular DVD version definitely make this buy even better, and without spoiling it, give it a shot and I think you might see it again just to see those extra's.</p></body></html>

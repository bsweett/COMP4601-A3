<meta name="summary" content=""An Amazing Film in Both Story and Acting Context""></head><body><p>Very rarely does a horror film find it's way into mainstream Hollywood. Most thrillers are big money makers, but much of the movie-going public would never admit to loving a horror film, or being ardent fans of the genre. None of this was true, however, for "The Silence of the Lambs". People to this day admit to loving the film and expressing the fact that it is one of their favorite motion pictures. Horror movies got a new respect after the release of "Silence", but many producers continued producing the garbage that we became accustomed to. "The Silence of the Lambs" was an original, unlike anything we have ever seen before.<br /> The film stars Jodie Foster, who's working as a student for the FBI, and gets an assignment with the Buffalo Bill Murders in the northeast, where women are being brutally killed. It is up to her to try to drain information from Hannibal Lecter, played brilliantly by Anthony Perkins, who is in captivity for being a murderer himself.<br /> The film is graphic, horrifying, but amazingly perfect. The script, acting, and the superb direction would all lead the film to sweep the Oscars in 1991, winning the top four major awards that year. It won acting accolades for its two stars, Jodie Foster and Anthony Perkins, and the movie won for direction, and rare for a horror film, it won Best Picture.<br /> The film transfer is impeccable, and the sound excellent. There are a ton of DVD extras, including interviews with the stars, trailers, and the packaging is one of the best I have seen for a movie release. A wonderful edition to any film library.<br /> The film would also spawn sequels like "Hannibal" and "The Red Dragon", as well as a prequel called "Hannibal Rising", depicting how Hannibal became a killer. If your a fan of "The Silence of the Lambs" pick up all 3 DVD's: they are wonderful pieces of cinematic work.<br /> Pick up the novel in which the movie is based on by Thomas Harris, also called "Silence of the Lambs". Don't read it alone though!</p></body></html>

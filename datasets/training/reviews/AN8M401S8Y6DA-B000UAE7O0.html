<meta name="summary" content="Did Planet Terror remind anyone else of Lawrence of Arabia?"></head><body><p>Cherry Darling played by Rose McGowan who strips to get a "leg up" and make "ends meat" realizes her destiny with a little help from her ex boyfriend "El Ray" and a machine gun leg after an experimental bio-weapon is released turning everyone into zombie like creatures.  At the end in her Arab like garments and how far she'd come it reminded me of Lawrence of Arabia albeit by means of a fun gore fest b horror movie about three hours shy of David Lean's epic masterpiece and instead a cool Rodriguez film.<br /><br />There are some other minor plot points such as Bruce Willis and his ties to Osama Bin Laden.  A love triangle between Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas (along with a few gratuitous shots of her) Marley Shelton and her abusive husband played by Josh Brolin there both doctors and this comes in handy as she can keep needles under her garter.  A sheriff played by Michael Biehn (Aliens, Terminator) who wants his brothers barbecue recipe and last but not least keep an eye out for the babysitter twins.<br /><br />Out of the two grindhouse features I found Tarantino's Death Proof to be the more artistic and probably better film although I found Planet Terror to be the better action movie and a fun ride, although Death Proof did have one of the best car chase scenes I've seen perhaps since The French Connection.  It's kind of the way I view Alien and Aliens.  Alien to me is a great film and to me superior however Aliens is also great and one of the best action movies I have ever seen.<br /><br />All and all released together or separately or if they come out with more editions there both two cool movies and some of the best of 2007 and a worthy add to any collection and both dvds are filled with extra, I've listed Planet Terror's below.<br /><br />You do get one of the fake trailers on this one Machette at the beginning of Planet Terror it's a Mexploitation film.<br /><br />DISC I Feature Film<br />Extended and Unrated<br />Feature Commentary by Rodriguez<br />Audience reaction track<br />International trailer and poster Gallery<br /><br />DISC II<br />10 Min film school with Rodriguez<br />The Bad babes and tough guys of Planet Terror<br />Casting Rebel<br />Sicko's bullets, and explosions:  The stunts of Planet Terror<br />The friend, The doctor, and the real estate agent.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Title, Greater Movie"></head><body><p>Based upon the 1962 novel by Ken Kesey, the book, along with this great film, is said to be some kind of social commentary, being a clash of the establishment and rebellion.  Some people say that this movie is merely just a footnote of the times.  I disagree.  In 2009, I can watch this movie and understand it greatly, and I can still appreciate this movie's many little sayings on various human qualities (according to the reviewer, the novel is more trippy or something.  Beats me).  Oh, and it also has fun and freshness thanks to the many quirky characters (hey, it's a mental hospital!).<br /><br />Unlike what other people say, I don't think this movie is really a product of it's time.  Such themes as sadism, supression, and other means of control are nothing new, things that are probably just human nature and happen all the time.  People who get great pleasure from controlling others who are inferior regarding mental strength is nothing exclusive to the early 60's.  Teachers these days sometimes do it to kids.  Roommates can do it to another roommate.  Observing others, and you will most definitely find many elements of human nature.  I agree with Jim Emerson in that the characters actions are all human nature, not just the mindset of it's times.<br /><br />This also is a character study that I don't mind studying at all.  These kind of characters are quirky, totally likeable, with tons of traits that make you feel emotions for these characters portrayed on screen (being fictional, no less).  They do it with ease.  Randal McMurphy is a rebel who is likeable, and I feel that Nurse Ratched is a despicable human being, with no sympathy toward her.  These two central people fight for their own beliefs, and it's great to see Ratched's tryannical and slightly sadistic and cruel iron fist slowly go down in a vain attempt to stop the rebel.  Sidestepping the battle between the two, the rest of the ward is just as good, with the same kind of traits.  The Chief is a noble, interesting, and mysterious man who really makes an impression.  You can learn a lot more by reading the book on this character (since the book is narrated from his eyes).  I also find quite al iking for Billy on a particular note, simply because I feel it's just so bad to have a mother who prevents her son from liking women (what a life that must be).  His demise in particular makes you wince when you think about it.<br /><br />I could go on and on, and while they don't feel like your friends or anything of that nature (I tend to only feel that way about Dazed and Confused), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest feels just like one of the classic stories where you love reading about them and the story, and don't feel like your falling victim to the 3rd person syndrome.<br /><br />I also think the directing is very nice, as well as the music and visuals.  Sure, this isn't a highly stylized picture of any sorts, in fact, the grainy picture (thanks to the picture of the DVD and the movie's old print, I think) makes it seem kind of flat, almost documentary looking style.  However, while that's cool, the directing is top notch, effortlessy made.  However, I think what also makes the movie look special is what he captures.  I think this guy captures some great shots, and there's nothing more.  Oregon is a beautiful state (this whole movie is shot on site), and the scene where he breaks the inmates out of feels is as refreshing on screen as it would be in real life.  The music makes the movie even more better.  Especially a scene such as described works wonders, because the music is light, and beautifully captures the whole moment of it.  Easy to see why Milos Forman got an Academy Award for Best Director, his 1st out of his 2nd Academy Award (Amadeus).<br /><br />I admit that I kind of beamed when I read "Smashingly Effective, Emotionally Powerful" from the late great Pauline Kael, hearing it from a critic such as that (she seems very opinionated and doesn't shower praise like some other critics).  I only thought the bad thing was the ending, which was good but not as good as the novel version.  While this movie may not quite live up to that, I feel that One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest to still be a film that has q bit of everything, including humor, some tragedy, some social commentary, and a place with people you would probably want to visit more than once.  This is an entertaining and powerful movie worth seeing again and again.<br /><br />B+</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I've definitely seen better, but this was at least modestly entertaining."></head><body><p>I watched this at the local second-run theater. I'm not a huge fan of M. Night Shyamalan, especially after The Village, which I thought was a dud. When I went to see this one I was skeptical, but I figured it was worth the gamble of $2.50. Overall I can't say I was impressed, but I must admit that the storyline was intriguing and the characters, if generally shallow, were entertaining. I particularly liked Reggie, the guy who works out only one side of his body "as a scientific experiment". Shyamalan himself, who normally puts in only cameo appearances in his films, played a surprisingly large role in this one, but he should stick to writing and producing, not acting.<br /><br />On the plus side, I thought Shyamalan did a good job of developing the character of Cleveland Heep, played by Paul Giamatti, who in turn did excellent work bringing this character to life. I also enjoyed some of the special effects, such as the scrunt lying in the grass with its red eyes aglow. Finally, the little plot twist at the end, such as it was, gave this film that little nudge over the top from being a total snoozer to being worth seeing.<br /><br />Is this supposed to be some great allegory? Maybe Shyamalan meant it that way, and I certainly see how some viewers can interpret it as such. As for me, I wasn't looking for that, so I didn't pay much attention to the potentially allegorical elements of it. I was watching it for raw entertainment value on a rainy Saturday afternoon. Did I get my $2.50 worth? Yeah, I think so. Would I watch it again? Probably not.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sweeter than sugar"></head><body><p>Still a classic after all these years, and a monument to Julie Andrews' splendid voice. Mary Poppins has stood the test of time, with generation after generation enjoying it as much as the previous one and the songs such as "A Spoonful of Sugar" are timeless treasures that live on longer than anything that will ever appear on the Top 40. Buy one for yourself, one for your kids, and one for the grandkids. A must-have for any film fan.</p></body></html>

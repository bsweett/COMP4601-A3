<meta name="summary" content="Makes you wish you had a Blu-ray player!"></head><body><p>Seeing the Blu-Ray Guide of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs makes you really wish you had a Blu-Ray player. Besides the high-def version of the video and 7.1 sound, there are not one but two blu-ray discs loaded with extras to wet the most demanding appetite for details about Disney's first movie: three games, four backstage documentaries along with the classic bonus features complement the feature.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't make an informed comment about the quality of any of the Blue-Ray portions since I still only have a regular DVD player. As for the DVD disc included, it consists of the classic movie with restored picture and sound, a few trailers, a music video with Tiffany Thornton singing "Some Day My Prince Will Come" and a pretty nice sneak peek into The Princes and The Frog.</p></body></html>

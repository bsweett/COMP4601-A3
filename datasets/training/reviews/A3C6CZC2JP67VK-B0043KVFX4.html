<meta name="summary" content="[2.5]--The Extinction out of the Three"></head><body><p>I was rather bored with this film. Gone are the elements from the first 2 that relate to the games. Gone is any form of character development (I know there wasn't lots in the first 2 but there was some). Gone (and I felt the most important) is the dark element from the first 2. Yes, I do mean as in lighting but more so that sense of hopeless foreboding. After all, these films are zombie films and any good zombie film has that underlying hopelessness as let's face it, a zombie outbreak begins....you're pretty screwed once it's out no matter what you do.<br />In the finale in the series, mankind is mostly extinct except for a few survivors. Some of the survivors are living in the world and continue to exist by not staying in one area for too long. Other survivors include the last of the Umbrella Corporation which caused the T-virus to escape in the first place. They live underground and continue to plot how to continue living in a world over run by the undead. The Umbrella group's plan is to control the undead and train them in ways that will domesticate them and make them easily controlled, but to hell with the human survivors. This is something I don't understand. Why try to domesticate flesh craving zombies? Why not help the human survivors to extinguish the zombies once and for all and try to start a new world?<br /><br />Bravo to Mr. Anderson for actually wanting to have more daytime settings this time around but it just didn't work.....and what's with the virus making everything baron wasteland? It's dull to look at. There is one city shot near the end and this is what I wanted more of. Where was the harm in continuing the story from where number 2 left off?<br /><br />What we end up with is the makers of the film saying 'you know the premise, we're just going to try and dazzle you with action set pieces and hope you're all in your teens in order not to notice that all we've done is make a poor film but robbed you of the entrance fee' I'm not in my teens and therefore not fooled. They still managed to fail in the action areas for so many reasons. Paul WS Andreson said after the first film he would like to make a trilogy. He should have stuck to that and used this as the opportunity to find a fine balance between the first 2 films to have the series go out on a bang....but he didn't and now we are faced with the prospect of a 4th film.</p></body></html>

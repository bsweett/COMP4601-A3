<meta name="summary" content="What was this--a movie or a farce?"></head><body><p>Since the first spotlighted reviewer wrote exactly what I had to say, I have to re-think "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull." What is there new to say?<br /><br />I adore Harrison Ford. Has he won that special Oscar yet? He should (but not for this role). Let's get right on to Karen Allen. "Marian, you're going to drive off the cliff." "Trust me, Indie. I know what I'm doing," and she does. She drives right onto a tree over the river and the car is gently delivered into the water. Wow! How is this possible? Because she is older and better? Because this is an Indiana Jones movie and the characters can do darn well anything they set their minds to doing. Then they skee-daddle right over a huge waterfall in that car. No problem. No broken bones. No concussions. Everyone lands a foot from their sitting place in the car and hops right back in. Then they do it again two more times over two more waterfalls.<br /><br />But my favorite action scene is when Indie and is-his-name-Mutt-or-Mudd? are riding the motorcycle through campus, trying to escape mad Russians representative of the Three Stooges minus one. Indie is pulled off the bike right through that little car window. After he wrestles around with the Stooge a bit, he slips right out that window onto the motorcycle again! Holy Moly! At his age he's that agile?<br /><br />One other thing that seriously bothered me was Indie opening the cocoons and allowing the folks inside to puff--go up in dust! No posterity! You'd think an archaeologist would know better.<br /><br />I do have a favorite scene: At the end when he and Marian kiss, it's such an old geezer kiss. Come on, Lucas and Spielberg, even as geezers we can still pucker out a wet one.<br /><br />I dozed off during this movie. I dozed during an Indiana Jones movie! What's wrong with the world? And that kid? Please don't make him the next "Indie" He doesn't have IT!</p></body></html>

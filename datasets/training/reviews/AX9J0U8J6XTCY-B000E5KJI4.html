<meta name="summary" content="one hell of an epic spectacular film! will become a classic."></head><body><p>MAGNIFICENT TO BEHOLD, WITH SOME REALLY FINE ACTING TO BOOT, 'TROY', despite some really negative barbs from the usual boring critics, is a real epic spectacular!  wondrous to behold, breathtaking in it's vastness and scope, i along with a theatre full of people seemed extremely satisfied by mr. petersen's intrepretation (historians need not apply)! it really is awesome to see in all of it's screen wonders, some really fine performances, esp. mr. pitt, mr. bloom, and especially eric banas. it is also a joy to see the late peter o'toole and julie christie again. if you want 3 hours of eye popping visuals, some really splendid battle sequences, you will not go wrong with :TROY:.  we loved it and are eagerly awaiting the dvd release tuesday, 1/4!  it's an epic not to be missed.  happy new year to all.</p></body></html>

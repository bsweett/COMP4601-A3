This means those of us who own widescreen TV's have to either watch a tiny image to get the best quality picture or zoom it out and lose quality. No thanks I'll take the chance and wait.<br /><br />The quality of the disc 2 original is OK, but you need to know that the picture is not anamorphic. What this means in simple terms is that on a widescreen TV you get black bars top and bottom as well as right and left, unless you use your TV's zoom option.<br /><br />Next year is the 30th anniversary and George Lucas may do us all a favour next year and release the originals as they were supposed to be seen.</p></body></html>

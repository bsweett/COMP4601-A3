Clayton is not a hero. He is called to take care of a trial lawyer who stripped naked during a taped disposition and started chasing one of the defendants. He ranted about his love for the client. She was an angel I guess. Clayton has some experience in dealing with his bipolar co-worker. Clayton job is to get his co-worker back on his meds. However, the co-worker has other plans and is pretty much smarter than his bosses and Clayton. The primary counsel for the firm's client orders the co-worker killed because the co-worker is going to spill the beans about a class-action law suit that will cost her company billions of dollars. The coworker is killed. Clayton figures out what happens and confronts the primary counsel and gets her on tape. This pretty much the plot. Clayton investigates his friend's death for pretty much righteous reasons, but gives up because he gets $80K, which will pay his debt to some loan sharks. He only confronts the counsel because she tries to have him killed and the hired killers miss. There is no one to root for in the movie, except for the plaintiff. Clayton does nothing really noble in all this. He even breaks the law and puts his brother's career in danger to gather the evidence.<br /><br />The plot was ok, but I thought the car bomb idea was ludricous. How could the police not miss the connection with the other death, especially since Clayton's brother is with the police. The hired killers were not so smart.  Clooney was excellent as Clayton. Swinton did not have much of a role for her vast talent. All the actors were very good. The direction was crisp and purposeful. It was an enjoyable experience. However, the movie has absolutely no message except how corrupt the corporate world is. I enjoyed the movie while I watched it, but wondered afterwards, what was the point it was trying to make.</p></body></html>

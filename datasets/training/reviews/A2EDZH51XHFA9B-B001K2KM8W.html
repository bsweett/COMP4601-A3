Guillermo del Toro has done it to me for the first time in six years (almost to the day) with the final ten minutes of El Laberinto del Fauno.<br /><br />Del Toro is the epitome of the Curse of Hollywood; when he is imported and works under the Hollywood machine, he makes execrable movies like Mimic and Blade II (though I have to admit I did enjoy Hellboy). When left to his native country, however, he makes movies like Cronos and El Espinazo del Diablo. Now he goes back to Espinazo's alternate-reality Spanish Civil War for what looks to be the second in what will inevitably come to be called a trilogy of Spanish Civil War ghost stories (3663, the third, is tentatively slated for release in 2009 as I write this). And once again: if you bring him to Hollywood, he makes Blade II. If you leave him in Mexico, he makes a movie nominated for six Academy Awards. Can you name the last film whose dialogue was entirely in another language to be nominated for six Academy Awards? (Let me give you a hint: the answer is "none." The record, which was held jointly by Fanny and Alexander (1983) and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000), was four.)<br /><br />El Laberinto del Fauno is the story of Ofelia (Rottweiler's Ivana Baquero), a young girl in Spain at the tail end of the Spanish Civil War. Her mother Carmen (Welcome Home's Ariadna Gil) has been recently wed to the Captain (Some Kind of Blue's Sergi Lopez, doing his best Ralph Fiennes impersonation) of a detachment in a remote area, hunting down an enclave of rebels. Carmen is pregnant and the baby has made her quite ill. Ofelia, who has no liking for the captain, withdraws into the twin defenses of her only friend, Mercedes (Y Tu Mama Tambien's Maribel Verdu) and her own fantasies, in which she is the unknowing princess of an underground kingdom; she can only be restored to her place on the throne by performing three tasks for Pan (Hellboy's Doug Jones), a faun who lives in the buried heart of a labyrinth that's been behind the mill where they live since, Mercedes tells Ofelia, long before the mill itself was built. As the real world gets more and more unimaginably brutal, with the Captain, already a vicious sadist, slowly losing his grip on reality himself, Ofelia retreats farther and farther into the dream-world she's created. The question that serves as the film's constant undercurrent is whether Pan is, truly, the product of Ofelia's fantasies, and by extension which of the two worlds is the real one.<br /><br />There is a great deal to be written about fantastic archetypes here, and how well del Toro conforms to them (and the ways in which he plays with them to suit his own ends); I am certainly not the person to write it, as my days of studying mythology were long ago and, at best, incomplete. Those with a more comprehensive understanding of myth would be better qualified to do so; all I can say is that Ofelia's fantasies (assuming that's what they are) are almost universal; ruling over a kingdom, the quest, the heroic sacrifice, it's all there. (I'm sure someone could put out a dissertation comparing Ofelia to Beowulf, or maybe even Gilgamesh.) I'm more interested in the idea that, perhaps, it's the "real world" that's the fantasy here, and the way the Captain's character plays into that interpretation over time. It's easy to imagine the Captain as "the bad guy" from the very beginning here (and there is also a good deal to be written comparing the Captain and the creature known in the credits as The Pale Man, seen in almost every publicity still for the film), and to be sure he's never exactly a good guy. But he is certainly not the monster at the beginning of the film that he is by its end. While whatever it is that drives his degeneration is never fully revealed to us-- one is tempted to say it is the impending birth of his child, for lack of a more explicit mechanism-- that he degenerates is obvious. The Captain's increasing agitation runs in parallel to the escalation of danger in Ofelia's world, but which one drives the other? There are a lot of layers to be peeled back here to get at the heart of this story-- assuming it has a heart, and is not just an infinite number of layers of interpretation.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the movie is not without its flaws, however minor they may be. None of these flaws is technical, as the movie is gorgeous in every capacity (and of its six Academy Award nominations, three are technical-- Cinematography, Art Direction, and Makeup, all of which it should be a shoo-in to take). Nor are there any flaws in the acting; all of the principals do a fine job with their roles. Ivana Baquero will not be playing minor roles in low-budget Brian Yuzna horror films any more after this, I'd warrant. I'm almost willing to go out on a limb and tentatively blame an editor for this, as del Toro seems, especially in light of meditation on this film, to have wanted to spend equal amounts of time exploring the "real world" and Ofelia's fantasy world; the finished product spends a lot more time in the real world, something for which, given the reviews, trailers, etc., I was entirely unprepared. I'm guessing there's a lot of fantasy-world material that for some reason ended up on the cutting room floor. More's the pity. Couldn't the extraneous mill-mole subplot have been axed instead?<br /><br />Still, the film was nominated for the Palme d'Or (and got a twenty-two minute standing ovation at Cannes on its first screening), seems a no-brainer to net Mexico it's first Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award, sits at #88 on IMDB's Top 250 Films as I write this, and has so much about it to recommend that any flaw in its makeup seems minor in comparison. It is far too early to proclaim El Laberinto del Fauno one of the world's finest movies, but I can say with great authority that, love it or hate it, this is a movie from which you cannot emerge unaffected. That is his job as a filmmaker, and he has performed it better than he has in his estimable career to date. See this movie and be amazed. **** ?<br /><br />(Oh, and since I didn't mention them: the film's other two nominations are for Best Original Score and Best Original Screenplay.)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Retro romp"></head><body><p>70s throwback movies seem to go through a minor vogue period last year - as well as 'Anchorman', 'Starsky and Hutch' made it big last summer. Will Farrell stars as Ron Burgundy - scotch loving, smooth haired, charming, big fish in a small pond newscaster in 1970s San Diego, loved by all with his catchprase 'Stay Classy San Diego'. He bestrides a ludicrous team of reporters such as the retarded weatherman Brick and sexist primal jackass reporter Brian. This absurd assembly is shattered by the arrival of the stereotypically glamorous Veronica Corningstone. Ron preposterously seduces her, despite her obvious intial misgivings and this upsets the boys culture around the newsroom. Things go badly wrong for Will after he accidently hits a moustacioed biker with a burrito, leading ultimately to Veronica taking over as chief anchor.<br /><br />The movie is, primarily, a comedy, and it is funny. So it succeeds. But it could have been so much better. Instead of being a tight, acerbic satire of early feminist breakthroughs in sexist, boys dominated 1970s institutions. Instead, it is dominated by Farrell (who tailored the script himself) to such an extent that it becomes a showcase for him to experiment with all his goofy comic talent. Thus the comedy falls from the rank of those that are both funny and meaningful and holds itself shabbily together as a reduculous goofball romp. Shame.</p></body></html>

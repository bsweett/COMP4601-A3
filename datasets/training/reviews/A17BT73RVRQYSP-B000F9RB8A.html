Frankly you don't, you just watch it and enjoy.<br /><br />The plot of this picture takes quite a few twists and turns, you never really know where it is going until the very end.<br /><br />The writing is simply awesome, and Chow is at the top of his game but it is Qiu Yuen far removed from her days as a kung-fu teenager in the Man with the Golden Gun who makes this film.<br /><br />The knife throwing scene is worth the price of the film alone.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Fictional characters ensemble more like a Marvel Team"></head><body><p>A superteam of fictional heroes taken from the works of H. Rider Haggard, Robert Louis Stevenson, Bram Stoker, Mark Twain, Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, and Oscar Wilde?  Sounds like it can't miss, especially when it's Allan Quartermain (q.v. King Solomon's Mines), Dr. Jekyll, Minna Harker, Tom Sawyer, Captain Nemo, The Invisible Man, and Dorian Gray.  On the other hand, it sounds like X-Men 1899, or should that be The Fantastic Seven?<p>The year, 1899.  Tensions already hot between England and Germany due to the naval arms race (not mentioned, but something I thought I'd throw in, due to my knowledge), come closer to boiling point when a tank, similar to the ones that would be used in World War I, makes a raid on an English bank.  Germany is blamed.  A Zeppelin factory in Germany is attacked.  Naturally, Britain is blamed.  Worldwide consequences are foreseen, despite the fact that it's eight years before the formation of the Triple Entente.<p>Allan Quartermain is dragged from the wilds in Kenya back to England and asked by a gentleman cryptically named M, to have a martini shaken not stirred.  Kidding, but think of the similarities between this M and another M in a series of movies starring Connery.  Anyway, this M resurrects the League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen, comprising of unique personalities, to combat the villain, identified only as the Phantom.<p>A lead takes them to Venice, courtesy of Nemo's ivory-coloured submarine, the Nautilus.  (Cue "We all live in an ivory submarine" haha).  Digital technology has to be commended for the realization of this nautical marvel.<p>Connery puts his usual combination of charm, dignity, and toughness as Allan Quartermain.  However, given his employer's name, "M", I wonder if he felt more than a trifle of annoyance at the James Bond reference.  I'm not sure about Tony Curran playing the Invisible Man with some cheekiness.  However, Peta Wilson, exuding a calm beauty as Mina Harker is a surprise, playing Jonathan Harker's widow with restraint, that is until she gets stirred up and goes on a red-wine binge, vintage A, B, AB, or O.  She also becomes an object of attraction for the debonair Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend), invulnerable because of... Oscar Wilde readers will know full well what I mean, and plain-speaking Tom Sawyer (Shane West).  West plays Sawyer as kind of a surrogate son for Quartermain.  And veteran actor David Hemmings (Barbarella, Blow Up, Deep Red) has a small role in the beginning as Nigel.  Jason Flemyng as Dr. Jekyll is interesting, as he has conversations with his CGI alter-ego.  Naseeruddin Shah plays the turbaned Nemo, resplendent in blue,  with an air of dignified leadership.<p>Apart from the obvious inspirations, there is a nod to Victor Hugo's The Phantom Of The Opera and in a scene in Paris, Quartermain's mention of the police trying to catch an ape owes something to Edgar Allan Poe's "Murders Of The Rue Morgue."<p>While not a bad yarn and an interesting concept to boot, I find its comparison to a 19th century version of the Marvel Comics heroes to be very derivative.  The action scenes still have that dizzying sound-and-fury effects that's become the norm in today's action movies.<p>One positive thing I see about this movie is that it might get people to read the book from whence these characters came from.  You know, book, n. "a volume made up of written or printed pages fastened along one side and encased between protective covers"?  Yeah, those things!  Overall rating:  3.45 out of 5, rounded to 4.</p></body></html>

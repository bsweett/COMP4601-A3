<meta name="summary" content="Pixar Meets NASCAR in "Cars""></head><body><p>We end up owning the Pixar films on DVD, but still have seen every one in the theatre, and "Cars" was no exception.  My lack of interest in NASCAR didn't help my enjoyment, but the animation effects were amazing and eventually they got around to telling a story about life in the both the fast and slow lanes. Comparison to other Pixar films ("Finding Nemo", "The Incredibles" and the Toy Story films in particular), left "Cars" lacking something, storywise, in my view.</p></body></html>

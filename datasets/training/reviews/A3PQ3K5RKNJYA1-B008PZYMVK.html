Imaginative writing that was so hilarious, I couldn't wait for the next scene, to see if it was going to be funnier that the previous one. Orson Bean (Doctor Lester) was an unbelievable filthy, dirty, sex-starved old coot - "Insane, old lech" is how John Cusak's character; Craig Schwartz put it. The interplay between Cusak and Kathryn Keener (Maxine) was "way out there." Excellent direction from Spike Jonze.<br /><br />I don't know what else to add but that this was the weirdest, most enjoyable movie I've seen in years. We should all be so lucky as to be in John Malkovich's eyes and then spit out 15 minutes later.<br /><br />"I was John fu**ing Malkovich!" - exclaimed Cameron Diaz (Lotte Schwartz).  A total crackup. "Malkovich!"  "Malkovich!"  "Malkovich!"  "Malkovich!"  You'll love "Craig's Dance Of Despair And Disillusionment"</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Michael's best so far but by no means am I buying this"></head><body><p>Michael Bay, one of the more despised directors in Hollywood tends to make what I call "fluff pieces". They're not meant to be anything more than big explosive entertainment while numbing our mind in the process. The Island is Michael's first attempt at being a bit intelligent(loose use on that word) and be a little question-posing but then it becomes a typical sterilized world where everything's shiny and cool-looking but no emotional connection.<br /><br />Imagine waking up at a precise time, your clothes already picked and if there's an imbalance in your body, they ban it from your food and go on a diet. It's a world of extreme control which echoes 1984. Only as usual, someone questions his existence. In this case it's Lincoln Six Echo and together with Jordan Three Delta they escape the facility and learn the truth of their place(I won't spoil it despite the fact reviews and the trailer probably already did it for me).<br /><br />The film's success, or should I say the lack of it, most likely caused Dreamworks Pictures to be bought by Paramount. The film essentially didn't know how to promote it. They showed the sterile sheen of the facility and the outside world and even spoiled what the place is used for. So it's an existential intrigue drama with typical Michael Bay boomness. So they promoted it as such, making it too bipolar for an audience I assume.<br /><br />And you can tell the film's in 2 halves: in the facility and off. When they're in, everything's with glass, bright lights, tons of white clothing and post-modern architecture. They leave it's gritty and tons of explosions and there's the problem. It's trying to be 2 things at once but without the finesse of it. Blame it on Michael Bay probably since he loves his smashyness of things although it's toned down since Jerry Bruckheimer didn't produce.<br /><br />Performances are nice although not very dynamic. Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johanssen play a nice couple while normal menacing Sean Bean isn't really that much of a threat. Even him on the phone in Don't Say a Word had more villainness than here. And of course Steve Buscemi is back although better than in Armageddon and Michael Clarke Duncan's back too, on screen for about 10 minutes and doesn't leave much of a mark(personally, it's like he tries to hard to show he can "act".)<br /><br />I'm going to predict this and say there's a 2 disc Criterion edition coming out since there's not much extras. So in 2 ways I'm recommending that you rent: one to save money and also it's not really much of a good purchase.</p></body></html>

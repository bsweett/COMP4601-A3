<meta name="summary" content="the Greatest Animated Film of all Time, but was only the Begining"></head><body><p>It was almost 10 years after Walt Disney and the mouse he created became worldwide household names, that he gave Hollywood the first ever full length animated feature "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs". One of the greatest American films of all time, one of most renowed and the animated film to have the most releases from 1937-1993. An important masterpiece that is was once called "Walt Disney's Folly" but, who said that was very wrong, the film was immediate phemonenon and the highest grossing film of all time till it was knocked by "Gone with the Wind" I've been a fan of Disney for a long time and I know of all the animated films this is the one to see first. Snow White was only the begining, cartoons still stayed with Disney, but Snow White was Walt's turn to the movies. If you love Disney  as much as I do then see the most celebrated animated film of all time, the merriest and scariest of them all. See the one that started it all and still the fairest one of all.

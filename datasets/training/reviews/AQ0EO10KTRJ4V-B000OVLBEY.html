<meta name="summary" content="Why does Hollywood make dark films goofy ????????????"></head><body><p>This happens time and time again.........<br />WHY DOES HOLLYWOOD MAKE DARK CHARACTERS AND STORIES GOOFY, CAMPY AND SILLY ?<br /><br />There is a logic flaw somewhere with Hollywood quite often when it comes to comic characters or legends that eludes me.........<br /><br />They take a dark character and turn it into a goofy spoof of itself with some generic "Hollywood formula" that usually damages the film with fans and  loses the general audience because it changes the character that was apparently successful enough in the first place to be worthy of a movie.<br /><br />Consider for a moment with comic heroes........<br /><br />You have the comic fanbase who know the character and will be dissapointed if you tamper with it.<br /><br />Then you have the general public who knows little about the character and thus have no preconceived expectations.<br /><br />SO....<br />If you make the character faithful to the comic, the fans will praise it and the general public who have no other expectation will love it also.<br /><br />Instead when Hollywood turns a character like Ghost Rider into a campy pale shadow of itself, the fans are turned off and the general public are left wondering... "Why is this character so popular" ?<br /><br />The end result ?<br />Bad box office returns and the quick kill of a franchise before it can get started.<br /><br />Ghost Rider STARTED right on track, but once Cage entered and started his one-liner "Comedy Central" cracks and quirky sarcasm, the movie eroded quickly.<br /><br />Then try and forget the inconsistencies in story logic or even why an evil spawn with the power of Satan himself is affected by shotgun bullets, etc...<br /><br />The writers seemed to confuse Ghost Rider with the Hulk also........... Ghost Rider (original comic series) was articulate and spoke like a demon with long sermon like preachings when inflicting his wrath............. this movie version of Ghost Rider grunts and utters Hulk-like sentences like........ "Ahhhhh  You Guilty"<br /><br />The effects department deserves great accolades for a fine job.<br />They did their part to make a 5 star film.<br /><br />But that is a problem we see alot these days................ films focus on the effects but ignore the stories and character development.<br /><br />Is the General Public getting that dumbed down today -or- am I just getting to old ?<br /><br />People are razzle-dazzled by the eye candy and just ignore stories ?</p></body></html>

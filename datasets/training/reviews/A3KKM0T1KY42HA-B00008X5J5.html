<meta name="summary" content="For Your Princess"></head><body><p>It's so wonderful to live in a time when Disney's strange behavior of taking their classics off the market can be circumvented by great Internet marketers like Amazon. I was able to buy this 5 Star Disney Princess classic recently for my young princess through one of Amazon's third-party sellers. And without that opportunity, my little princess may have outgrown Snow White by the time Disney released it again.<br /><br />Let me just say that my little one was absolutely captivated by Sleeping Beauty, and to think that she would be deprived by Disney itself from seeing it at her perfect age is criminal.<br /><br />The story is familiar enough to any parent, so I won't go on about that other than to say that of all the Disney Princess classics, Sleeping Beauty (and Snow White) has some scenes that might scare a young princess under the age of 5.<br /><br />But you should take advantage of purchasing Sleeping Beauty or any of the other "off-the-market" Disney princess classics like Beauty and the Beast now via one of this site's resellers if you have a little princess of your own that might not appreciate it as much when Disney decides that it's time.<br /><br />And indeed, you will enjoy Sleeping Beauty or any of the other Princess classics as thoroughly as your young one.<br /><br />Side Note: Beware of exorbitant reseller prices; renting may be a better option if available. Also beware of REGION 2 resales; Region 2 DVDs will not play in most US DVD players. Look for Region 1 US Amazon resellers.</p></body></html>

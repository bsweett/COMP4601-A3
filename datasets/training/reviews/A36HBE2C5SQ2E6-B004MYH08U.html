Basically he takes the plot of the television series where a rich playboy, after finding out his father was killed by a hornet sting. We then find out that he is made the owner of the paper his father ran. He then turns to a crime because of his torrid relationship with his father so that he can use the newspaper to report on it. . He then sees some people in need of help, then turns on the other criminals. Basically he does bad stuff and then blames it on other criminals. I felt that aspect of it was really strange because he is basically committing crimes but getting away with it.<br /><br />I mean this series isn't nessacry Batman, Superman, or even Spider Man. It's one of those cult figures that goes under the radar and becomes something new for a audience. The show really lasted a short time, but it did bring Bruce Lee to us, but since Lee is gone, Chou took the reins and really shined as Kato. He showed off his talents by making us look at him in Awe as he did most of the stunts of the movie as they were nothing. He has a remarkable talent and I hope he is in future films that can also show what he is all about. The writing was all over the place in the movie, it felt like it had no direction and the dialogue was just plain ok.  Also, the direction by Gondry was some of his best, showcasing his music video skills, and implementing them into the film. It was a fun to watch movie mainly because of the stylistic direction. But the one big problem I had with the film was based on two actors. One underused, and one that was useless. Cameron Diaz, who I dislike, was in this film but yet she had no place, no big moments, and not anything else. I feel she was just here for us to look at her sagging face while Rogen cracked a joke. SHe was just a waste of space.<br /><br />The villain, Waltz, was not a villan at all. I mean what is it with writers and underwhelming villans? I mean there was one in Knight and Day, Mission Impossible 3, and numerous other movies that have been released in the past 5 years. Waltz is better than this movie, the man has a Oscar to his name yet he is doing movies like this that made me shake my head at the absurdity of it. He's a good actor, but he needs to pick better roles, and quit phoning it in.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this film was a mess, but it was watchable in some parts enough. I get the feeling people were just seeing it because they got sick of seeing True Grit or numerous other movies that have been out for almost a month. The film is not that good, but I expected it to do well, and I commend the movie studio for their thinking.</p></body></html>

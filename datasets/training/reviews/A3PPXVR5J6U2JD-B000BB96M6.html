Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory featured Gene Wilder as Wonka, an eccentric entrepreneur fond of candy of all stripes. The movie was based on a book for children, titled "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" by Roald Dahl.  The change in the title is telling, as it explains the focus of both the book and the movie.  When the movie came out, it didn't do very well, but has slowly achieved cult status on DVD.  Of course, it was only a matter of time before someone remade it.<br /><br />And that someone is Tim Burton, master of the wacky, whimsical, and macabre.  Having matured somewhat from the days of Edward Scissorhands and Nightmare Before Christmas, Burton has begun to imbue his films with more focus.  Big Fish was evidence that something has changed, and Burton is less willing to leave his characters bizarrely and endearingly mysterious.<br /><br />That leads us to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  You might assume that the change in the name means an emphasis once more on Charlie, but that's not really the case.  This movie, while truer to the book that inspired it, is still all about Willy Wonka.  Wonka's story seems a bit dated when you consider the plot: Wonka is an enigmatic and eccentric millionaire who decides to invite five children to tour his chocolate factory.  One of the five children will win something very special.  The rest...well the rest don't deserve it.<br /><br />But as an adult, the film has many other levels.  For example, Charlie's (Freddie Highmore) father, Mr. Bucket (Noah Taylor) puts caps on toothpaste and barely scrapes by at that.  His family is dirt poor; all four of his grandparents sleep in the same bed in the same room, where his mother and father live.  They don't even have a full roof over their heads.  And every day they eat cabbage soup.  Then one day, a robot replaces Charlie's father. And suddenly we realize, Charlie's father is representative of the employees sent reeling by the industrial age, from manual labor in the fields to manual labor in factories...to automation that ultimately makes manual laborers obsolete.<br /><br />Wonka decides to get rid of all the workers after too many of them end up selling his company's secret recipes.  Frustrated by the security breaches, Wonka fires all his workers.  And yet, the work continues.  How?  Wonka journeys to Loompaland, where he recruits the Oompa Loompas.  They all look the same (because they're all the same actor, Deep Roy).  They worship the cocoa bean, making them perfectly suited to working for Wonka. He can even pay them with cocoa alone!<br /><br />Or to put it another way, Wonka outsources his workforce.  They're from a "warm country," industrious, and work for far less pay.<br /><br />The children are all mirrors of different parts of society, and Burton can't resist poking fun at simultaneously updating them and poking fun at modern tropes.  We have the gluttonous Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz), the greedy Veruca Salt (Julia Winter), the violent Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry), and the overachieving Violet Beauregarde (Annasophia Robb).  Who isn't concerned about children becoming an Augustus Gloop, in a world of Supersizes where children stay inside all day? Who isn't concerned about spoiling their children rotten like Veruca Salt, where every kid has more than his parents ever dreamed of? What's to keep a Mike Teavee from using his superior, angry intellect that he vents on a videogame on his playmates...with a gun?  And isn't every Violet Beauregarde representative of the all-singing, all-dancing bleach-blonde cheerleaders-in-the-making that their parents trot out for beauty pageants? These children aren't horrible...they are a walking ghoul show of every adult's worst nightmares.<br /><br />It goes without saying that all these children fall victim to their respective sins and are cast out of Wonka's factory.  This sort of blatant retaliation against kids is rare these days, and it's a little shocking to see them get their just desserts.  Each departure is accompanied by an Oompa Loompa song, which went from cutesy Wizard of Oz type dances in the original movie version, to pure MTV/VH1 schlock rock.  I've never imagined Oompa Loompas in a swim routine, retro-80s dance off, acid rock antics, or Weird Al-style video montages.  It's deliriously funny and more than a little confusing at times.<br /><br />Through it all is Wonka himself.  The excellent Johnny Depp plays Wonka as a cross between Walt Disney and Michael Jackson.  This mix makes him alternately creepy and comical; Wonka is not always a sympathetic figure, but then you get the sense that perhaps he's not supposed to be.<br /><br />Wonka's story is fleshed out a bit more to explain who he is and how he came to be such a freak.  Additionally, the ending has been tweaked to leave everyone with a better conscience, which isn't such a bad thing.  However, the film has enough disturbing moments that it's not for young children...whimsy does not mean immature, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is definitely aimed at adults.<br /><br />In summation, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is actually a very basic morality play.  By keeping it simple and yet poking fun at political mores, fads, and icons (even shifting from 50s-style dress to 80s-style music), Burton creates a tale that's alternately funny, heartwarming, and a dire warning for parents everywhere.  Don't let your kids eat too much, spend too much, play too many games, or try too hard to be a winner.<br /><br />With standards like that, perhaps none of us deserve a visit to Wonka's Chocolate Factory.</p></body></html>

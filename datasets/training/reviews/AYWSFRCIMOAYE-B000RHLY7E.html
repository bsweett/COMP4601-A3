<meta name="summary" content="Yes, this movie is so bad that even the devil would reject  it!"></head><body><p>Thil film depicts ultra violence and gore. It tries to scare  the audience with brutal ways of killing  people<br />but the acting was so bad it's laughable. For example, in one scene a person was being killed with an ax. The<br />killer hit his victim at least three times with an ax. The victim screamed and moaned but he continued<br />to talk! His face was covered with blood but it showed no pain at all. The make-up looked absolutely fake.<br />It's so boring that I rejected it from the player after finishing two-third of it.<br /><br />There are much better horror movies which made me shudder. They are: Slither, Cabin Fever, 28 days later,<br />Pet Semetery and the Grudge.</p></body></html>

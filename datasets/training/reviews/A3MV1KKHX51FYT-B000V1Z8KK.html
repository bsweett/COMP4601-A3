<meta name="summary" content="He Was Only a Pawn in the Game"></head><body><p>The film begins with camouflaged snipers overlooking a valley. A convoy drives down a road and is targeted. Then the hunters become the hunted. Were they betrayed? Government agents meet the survivor and ask him to plan an assassination so they can stop it. The sniper explains the difficulty in shooting a target from a mile away. A plea is made. This lone gunman will take the assignment. Cameras allow "Big Brother" to watch people in the streets of Washington. Next he visits Philadelphia, the most likely venue. After his report they want him to be a spotter. The President arrives to make a speech. There is a surprise. [Was it telegraphed?] Now Swagger must escape from the good guys as well as the bad guys. He makes a daring escape to the river.<br /><br />The new FBI agent tells what happened and is cautioned about speaking. The corporate media convict Swagger in their news reports. [Who writes them?] Swagger treats himself for blood loss with a saline solution. Sugar was used to treat wounds for centuries. Swagger looks up the girl friend of his dead buddy and asks for help. "Bad things happen to good people." The new FBI agent Nick Memphis investigates the discrepancies and finds answers. "It wasn't my fault." Swagger tries to contact that Nick Memphis. More drama follows. Nick is abducted and tortured. But help arrives in time to rescue him. An expert explains how a duplicate bullet could be created. And tells of an expert shooter who could have done the job.<br /><br />Who is "Sczerbiak Mikhaylo"? "No loose ends this time." There is a meeting where a confession is given to Swagger. Is this a trap? There is a shoot-out and explosions for an exciting finish. Will there be a deal? There is more drama in the snowy mountains. Senator Meacham explains the facts of life. The FBI helicopters arrive. There is a final meeting in Washington with a trick about that rifle. And so it ends. Will Swagger get his revenge on the bad guys for a happy ending? Does the flaming ending satisfy the audience?<br /><br />The first part of the story echoes the JFK assassination then turns into a chase story that echoes "Rambo". The last part is a typical action film with shootings and explosions for the story of an agent betrayed by his government but who survives at the end. Films are made to be commercially successful by a design that Hollywood perceives will sell to the public. While many of the events in this film echo historical events, stringing them all together seems unlikely for this morality play.</p></body></html>

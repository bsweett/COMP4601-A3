The character first came to life in the movie PITCH BLACK.  In the first movie, Riddick is portrayed as a cold-hearted killer who happens to have the skills to get himself and a few survivors off a deadly world.  In CHRONICLES, he gets remade into a brooding loner/anti-hero whose destiny is to save worlds.  It's a huge step, and not one most moviegoers -- including fans -- can take in a single swallow.<br /><br />On the other hand, the upgrade to cutting-edge computer generated imagery is absolutely stellar.  When you see Helion Prime and the other worlds and sets on the screen, the tendency is to believe that they really exist.  The world just comes across as incredibly real.<br /><br />The problem is that the film is somewhat lackluster, depending on the star power of Diesel (not a bad bet) and some of the other supporting actors and actresses to move the story along.  Unfortunately, not much character comes to light.  Riddick is busy telling everybody that the fight with the Necromongers (who come entirely too close to the Borg from Star Trek for my liking) isn't his.  He tells them this while standing in the doomed city the Necromongers are currently taking over.  Talk about timing!<br /><br />Personally if I'd been Riddick, I'd have just found a new place to hide and disappeared for another five years.<br /><br />Still, the film delivers on more than the CG and visual splash.  There are plenty of over-the-top fights and near-death escapdes that will keep you in your seat waiting to see how it all turns out.<br /><br />There's a cliffhanger of an ending, though, but Diesel has stated that there will be two more films in the Riddick continuity.  He hasn't said when those will be coming out.  But for a B-grade SF movie night with your buddies and a generous portion of whiz-bang graphics to show off your new HD DVD player, you can't go wrong with this movie.</p></body></html>

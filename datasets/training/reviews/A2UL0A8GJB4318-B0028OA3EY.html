<meta name="summary" content=""Superman Returns""></head><body><p>In a post 9-11 world, we have usually taken our heroes (comic book or otherwise) with a healthy dose of derangement.  Comic book hits like "Spiderman," "Batman Begins" and Bryan Singer's "X-Men" films thrived and fostered on the darker, deformed sides of their eponymous superpowered warriors and the weighty themes of their stories.  And usually, the films were tremendous, as superhero, comic book flicks grew and matured beyond the juvenile stereotypes that the general public had for them.  But, for a while, it seemed we would no longer buy into heroes who were earnestly virtuous, and who did righteous deeds because they felt they had a responsibility to a higher cause.<br /><br />But then, "Superman Returns" rolled around.  And even though it bears a couple nagging flaws, the most glaring of which is a somewhat sluggish pace, "Superman Returns" is by far one of the most ravishing, bustling and joyous films in years.  Its' by equal turns exciting and romantic, and in a refreshing change of pace, director Bryan Singer does not drive his film with angst, but with sincerity.  Not only will you believe again that a man can fly (the special effects and set pieces are spectacular), but that a man can be unambiguously moral.  The biggest triumph of this new "Superman" is it reminds all of us that it just might be possible to be Supermen on our own.<br /><br />The film opens with the return of Superman (Brandon Routh, ably filling the shoes of the late Christopher Reeves) after a five year search to find the devastated remains of his homeworld.  Back in Metropolis, the Man of Steel, tries to reconnect with Lois Lane (a superb Kate Bosworth), only to find she has moved on to a new man (James Marsden) with whom she has sired a child.  But in the background, the malevolent Lex Luthor (a smarmy, gleefully vicious Kevin Spacey) has bought his way out of prison to fashion a new scheme to kill Superman and conquer the world.<br /><br />Singer, and his writers Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris, work hard, and succeed, to reestablish Superman for a new generation by first and foremost breathing new life into the romance between Supes and Lois Lane.  Routh and Bosworth are dynamic as two star-crossed lovers learning to how to relate to one another again and their performances yield emotional, heartfelt dividends.  Meanwhile, Spacey, a Singer Veteran from "The Usual Suspects," has a ball as Lex Luthor, happily chewing scenery with the efficiency of a born baddie.  All told, "Superman Returns" with  surely be fondly remembered as one of the best films of the summer.</p></body></html>

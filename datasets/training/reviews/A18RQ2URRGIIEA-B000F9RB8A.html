The fictional story is set in China probably before the Japanese invasion in the city of Shanghai.  A ruthless black-suited gang, known as the Axe Gang, controls the police and spreads terror where ever it is in control.  It also thrives financially on casinos. However, the Axe Gang (and other less influential gangs) tend to ignore the poorest areas, including a little-known set of dilapidated apartments and shops known as Pig Sty Town.  Its landlord (Wah Yuen) and extremely loud landlady (Qiu Yuen) often fight with each other and make frequent calls and demands upon their poor renters.  One day, two men claiming to be part of the Axe Gang pass through Pig Sty Town.  The two men, Sing (Stephen Chow) and his sidekick (Chi Chung Lam) try to bully themselves with the poor Pig Sty Town residents, but are quickly thwarted by the noisy landlady.  In at attempt to call for help, Sing shoots a firework beyond the walls of Pig Sty Town and it happens to land upon the head of a real Axe Gang boss, who is traveling with a dozen or more black-suited gang members and immediately demand to know who attacked them.  Amazingly, three of Pig Sty Town's poor residents attack the gang with heroic kung fu fighting.  Angered, The Axe Gang leader, Brother Sum (Kwok Kuen Chan), hires two kung fu masters to attack Pig Sty Town.  He also makes Sing an offer: if he can prove himself by killing someone, he can join the Axe Gang; but Sing and his sidekick can't quite be as evil as they would like, especially when they encounter a mute young woman (Si Lu Ren?) and her ice cream stand.  Using an unusual stringed instrument filled with weapons, the two kung fu masters (Kang Xi Jia and Hak On Fung) attack the three poor Pig Sty Town residents that have superb martial arts skills, while the landlady screams at them from above to keep quiet.  The two kung fu masters are very good until they the landlord and landlady come out to confront them.  The Axe Gang then decides to recruit a very powerful kung fu master known only as The Beast (Hsiao Liang), who is located in a mental health asylum.  The Beast brings out the truth about who the landlord and landlady are, but Sing may discover things about himself as well.<br /><br />With interesting kung fu choreography enhanced with computer-generated special effects and humor, "Kung Fu Hustle" is entertaining, but some people may find some parts of it a bit too violent.  If you enjoy kung fu films, then you will probably enjoy this entertaining kung fu fantasy by Stephen Chow.  Overall, I rate the film with 4 out of 5 stars.  Other interesting characters include Rabbit-Tooth Jane (Kai Shi Chen), Donut (Zhi Hua Dong), Coolie (Yu Xing), the Axe Gang Advisor (Kai Man Tin), the Tailor (Chi Ling Chiu), the Axe Gang Vice General (Suet Lam) and the Crocodile Gang Boss (Xiaogang Feng).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This isn't for the kids."></head><body><p>Fairy tales never were. Oh, there was some prettying up in the 19th century and after, to stop the adults from having nightmares, then to keep the kids happy. But the original stories came from small, scared people in a big, scary world that they couldn't control or understand.<br /><br />Terry Gilliam has brought back all that. That thing you almost see moving in the dark corner - it's there. That strange person who seems to know things others don't - she does. That feeling that something is going to get you - it's true.<br /><br />The Brothers start out as carefree con-men, working their petty scams across the countryside. They preyed on the superstitious fears of the peasantry and the simple people of the villages. It turned out, though, that some of those old stories were real. Gilliam brings them to life with a deliciously eerie edge. Being Gilliam, you can count on a few (or more than a few) bubbly giggles mixed in, or the dark mood would simple congeal around you.<br /><br />It's good. I won't spoil the story for you, but it's good. There are some nice effects, but maybe not as many as you'd think. And don't worry about how that mirror got un-cracked after the first hit. It's just good. And scary.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

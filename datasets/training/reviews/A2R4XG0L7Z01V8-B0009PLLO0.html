And this is only the second edition of this film - Oliver Stone has released another edition, the 'final' cut, which I unfortunately got recommended on Amazon. Does he really think a third edition is going to make the film worth watching? My answer's no.<br /><br />I got this for cheap, but now it has no re-sale value, and it looks like I'm stuck with it, unless I can fob it off onto some poor unsuspecting soul. People rave about Oliver Stone, the man who wrote Scarface (but who unfortunately cannot be blamed for the poster that everybody MUST have), like they rave about David Lynch or James Cameron. Personally? I couldn't sit through Natural Born Killers either. But I did sit through Lost Highway. What does that say? Two movies of Oliver Stone's that I cannot sit through.<br /><br />I watched it for an hour, and then checked to see how much longer I still had left to watch. When I saw I still had another hour and 40 minutes of pure hell, I switched it off. If there's no story in the first hour, then the director is either stretching it out big time, or there's no story to the film at all. And who the hell is Alexander? I never learned about him in my history classes at school. And I took them for four years.<br /><br />The only shining star in this film was Angelina Jolie, looking all Greek and gorgeous - but speaking in what can only be a Russian accent? Val Kilmer is absolutely wasted, considering what he had to go through with the fake scarring over his eye.<br /><br />There are so many 'good' reviews of this film, that it's hard to believe we watched the same film. It shows that throwing lots of money at a film will not necessarily make it a good film that people will flock to see. It's diabolical and should be forgotten about. Forget it ever happened, forget Oliver Stone ever actually had the audacity to release THREE different (but not better) versions of it and forget the big name stars actually got PAID to appear in this.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I planned on enjoying this movie...just didn't happen."></head><body><p>Okay, I'll admit that Brad Pitt was amusing and I liked the fact that the Dvd had subtitles just for him. The story was all over the place and the accents made the dialogue very hard to follow. I liked some of the editing and humor, but as a whole I wasn't that impressed. I'm sure glad I saw this one for free.</p></body></html>

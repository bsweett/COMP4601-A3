<meta name="summary" content="Yes, It's Only Rock and Roll- But I Like It"></head><body><p>What is there not to like, for an old rock `n' roll guy or gal at least, about a film with a story line about a down and out fanatic grunge rock musician who is down on his luck and then, by odd happenstance, gets a "temp" job, under false pretenses, teaching at a preppie private elementary school. And , of course, along the way it turns out the young students were really not looking to get ahead on the fast track to college but were really hiding their "inner rock" being under a bushel, that of classical music. Needless to say said rocker teacher throws out the book, gets the kids to lighten up and enjoy life a little, and maybe get a chance at rock stardom for themselves and, not coincidentally, him as well. Moreover, needless to say as well, those well-to-do parents paying large fees and authority figures responsible to those parental whims, especially one stern headmistress, do not see to see with this rock-driven  program. But all is well in the end as kids and rocker survive one more obstacle in the ordeal of childhood. The only thing that I need to add here is that actor, Jack Black, carries this thing with his energy, his facial expressions and his non-loser "loser" approach to the role. That said, just rock on.</p></body></html>

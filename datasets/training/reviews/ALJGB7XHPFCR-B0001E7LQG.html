I thought Diane Keaton looked great, and one can never get enough of Jack Nicholson misbehaving.  However, Keaton's character is the typical older woman who is bitter and resentful of men her age who show interest only in the younger woman. Her character never shows any such resentment towards those younger women themselves, nor does she acknowledge that she has actually raised a daughter who has turned into one of those younger women dating an older man. That sort of irony seems to be lost on Keaton's character. Perhaps she might admit, also, that if she had made better decisions about men when she was younger then she wouldn't be alone when she was older. Or perhaps the movie should just preach a tad bit less about how men are evil for liking younger women but how there's not a single thing wrong with younger women liking older men. These types of romantic comedies, and by type I mean totally unrealistic, idealistic misrepresentations, do more harm than good because they further exacerbate the already hugely problematic and offensive belief that anything wrong that's ever been done has been done so by a man.  There were a few funny lines and themes such as when Nicholson's character was in the hospital discussing Viagra, but this movie could have been better.</p></body></html>

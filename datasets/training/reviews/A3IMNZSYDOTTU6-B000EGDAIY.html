<meta name="summary" content="Absolutely Scary, 'Grudge' Is No Easy Watch..."></head><body><p>I remember when my mother watched this movie and thought it was one of the worst movies she ever watched. Still, I was tempted to test that idea that this was just a "clunky piece of trash" as my mom called it. I had never really watched many Japanese horror films besides the brilliant AUDITION, so I thought I would give this 'American' version of Ju-On: The Grudge a chance. What was my overall verdict? You'll find out later.<br /><br />At the beginning of the movie we meet Peter, a likable guy who later commits suicide, but for what? We find that out later. Cut to the next frame of the film in which we meet Yoko...a sweet and gentle Japanese girl who is tending to the care of a rather distraught old woman. The woman seems to have a sleeping disorder, so most of the time she is either sleeping or she is awake but silent, never really speaking at all. We do learn why she's in the state later on, and believe me once you see why you too will be scared. Now Yoko is left to clean up the mess in that house (absolutely no one in my home would ever leave a mess like this, and there are several parts in the film when the house is in complete disarray). Yoko suddenly hears a noise in one of the rooms on the upper level of the house, a thumping on the ceiling. As she goes to investigate after opening the door to the attic, she discovers to her terror a ghastly girl (Yuya Ozeki in creepy form like her "Ju-On" role) who attacks her, and the film cuts from there.<br /><br />Next up, we meet Karen and Doug (Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jason Behr), two lovers and students studying abroad who seem very happy. Karen also works to help tend to the care of people much like Yoko was, and after the agency discovers her missing, Karen is placed in lieu of her mysterious departure. Karen goes to the house to to tend to the care of the woman, but she has no idea what she's in store for once she's there. You see, there's a curse on this house, and we don't know it at this point, but a family who lived in that house when through a deadly ordeal. The wife of the previous family had an affair with Peter (Bill Pullman's character, in top form here) and the husband found her out, so in a fit of rage, he drowned his son and murdered his wife before committing suicide. Karen has no idea that these events took place, but she will later. As time goes on, another family descends upon the house led by Jennifer (Clea Duvall, a rather disposable performance - she was better in The Faculty), who is rather depressed. The police are also investigating the disappearance of Yoko and some murders that have taken place, and they discover a jaw in the attic. Throughout the movie, anyone who comes into contact with "the curse" will ultimately be pursued by it until they are killed by its consumption. The moments in the high rise apartment are tense, but the scariest moment of the movie is when one of the agency workers is walking down the stairs and the beaten down Yoko appears, dragging herself towards the stairs going down. When the worker slowly heads in Yoko's direction, he slips on a substance on the floor...her blood. When he asks what happened, she turns around and reveals...oh, but I can't give it away. But let me say this, it scared me when I saw what happened to Yoko. The detective (Ryo Ishibashi) reveals the story behind the "curse" to Karen, and there are many moments in the movie where you will see flashbacks to the events that occured in the house. Later in the movie, Doug, disturbed by what's happened to Karen, who witnessed the "curse" firsthand, decides to go off investigating things in the house on his own. When Karen finds that out, she heads to the house where the climax comes into play. She relives moments of the past in the house, where Peter has come to find the mother hung by her neck and the child scared. Things aren't in a good state as Karen witnesses, but reality comes back into play and the scary girl is after Karen to kill her off.<br /><br />In the final frame of the film, director Takashi Shimizu delivers a nice close. With the body of Doug under covers after his death, Karen goes to his body and sees for herself, but the "curse" seems to have found her and suddenly someone is standing behind her - the "curse" girl who has been tormenting some of the previous contacts and the film cuts with that rasping noise and the girl's creepy eyes. It's bound to make you look forward to next year's The Grudge 2, due out October 26.<br /><br />In the meantime, the director's cut offers 8 minutes of unseen footage, and a plethora of extras. No doubt if you want to see a good remake of a classic Japanese horror film (JU-ON was scary), then THE GRUDGE should ultimately satisfy your appetite. While not a classic in its own merits, THE GRUDGE is the ultimate story of the worst kind of "curse" that could ever be left behind.</p></body></html>

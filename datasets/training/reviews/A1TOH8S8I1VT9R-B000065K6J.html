<meta name="summary" content="Rube Goldburg reinvents the scythe.  Both Clever and Stupid."></head><body><p>(Don't look it up, a scythe is that big bladed thing the "Grim Reaper" claims lives with.  You can look up Rube Goldburg though; I don't feel like explaining him).<br /><br />So let's get to the point, "how can a stupid movie get 4 stars?  How can a stupid movie be clever?  I'm sure this has happened before, but let me explain why I like this stupid movie/DVD as much as I did; ** = mild spoiler.<br /><br />What makes it stupid?<br />-suspend disbelief very hard.  Psychic phenomenon is pretty well documented, but never in such an extreme or systematic way as far as I know.  I really had no problem with this aspect of the film.<br />-**A mortician who just happens to know way too much.  This guy appears in one scene out of the blue.  He basically is good friends with death and so, knows how everything works.  Oh, and he's a real nut job to boot.  This was the single most stupid and overly convenient caveat in the film.<br />-**Death as a shadowy entity was really not necessary.  This aspect kind of dumbed things down a little too much.  I expect some dumb stuff in horror films.  This was overt and lame.<br />-Some of these kids hate each other and we never know why.  This is probably my single biggest beef about the acting/script/story.  The whole rivalry thing was forced and over-blown (and otherwise unnecessary).<br />-The authorities, as usual, are idiots; Very clich&eacute;.<br />-One giant plot hole **(In what order did the other passengers die?).<br /><br />So, what makes it clever?<br />-**The entire concept of cheating death and the rules that go with it.  The mortician conveniently explains the rules and the kids go with it.<br />-**The methods of making people un-alive (here's where Rube Goldburg comes in).  One little act or defect leads to a ridiculous and entertaining chain of events.  Trying to stop death is like playing wack-a-mole the size of a pool table.  You had better be quick.<br />-Despite the "hate" thing, emotions and dialogue usually seam reasonably believable.  Different personalities react differently; Decent acting for a film of this type.<br />-Special effects are well done.  You may never again want to fly after seeing the opening sequence.<br />-Overall, a well made quality production.<br /><br />About the DVD:<br />-limited extras; lame deleted scenes, "when will you die?" game (always march 19th no matter what I put in), "are you psychic?" game, Good documentary about a psychic investigator in California.<br />-An insert.  No, really.  An actual paper insert.  These days; stunning.<br />-screened image on disk (again, stunning.)<br />-good sound, good image.</p></body></html>

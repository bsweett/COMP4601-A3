Lots of action and blood, and certainly more skin, this is a decent action picture with horror elements.  The story takes place within moments of the first film's finish.  If you forgot the first film, this one fills in you with flashbacks that give you enough to remember.  The story itself was just okay for me.  It didn't carry as big as it should have.  I kept thinking of Blade Trinity which had the original Dracula, so it should have been a huge story and it just fell flat.  This movie doesn't fall flat, it just never really takes off completely.  If you enjoyed the first film, you will surely enjoy the second.  I just don't think this will blow away any non-fan and convert them to the Underworld movies.</p></body></html>

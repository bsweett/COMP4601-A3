<meta name="summary" content="Decent Reimagining"></head><body><p>I remember when this film came out and was wondering how it would compare to the TV series of the Sixties.<br /><br />Harrison Ford is Dr. Richard Kimball who has been tried and convicted for killing his wife.  But he didn't do it!  Through an accident, he escapes and Federal marshal Girard goes after him, played seriously by Tommy Lee Jones.<br /><br />TV versus Movie!<br /><br />On TV it was a continuing series with Kimball disguising himself and avoiding Girard, going through various areas where he would use his medical knowledge to help others and became a master of disguise while he was at it.  Girard was obsessed when others gave up.<br /><br />The film has some of these elements, but seems more concerned with medical malpractice and how some doctors can go crooked.  This was the good part.  And Tommy Lee, though plays it in a wisecracking way, plays a pretty good cop.<br /><br />There were some pretty farfetched scenes:  Jumping off a waterfall would kill a normal man but not Richard Kimball!<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Action and adventure, though Girard is not as obsessive as the TV series, the crooked medical men hiding behind their reputations is intense.<br /><br />Check out the TV series:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q6GUSE">The Fugitive: Season One, Vol. 1</a></p></body></html>

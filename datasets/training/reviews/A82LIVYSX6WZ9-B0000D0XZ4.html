<meta name="summary" content="a notch better than last years spider-man"></head><body><p>last years spider-man didnt really grip me. though x-men 2, daredevil and this one right here did. Eric Bana(Black Hawk Down and Chopper) is great as the green man. Connelley is sexy as always and Nolte is well, he needs a new hairduo is all im saying. but I really liked this movie and I ignored my friends opinions on it as well. great visuals by Ang Lee and also great direction as well. sorta played like a comic book splitting the scenes in half and all and the hulk visuals are spectacular. one more note. They coulda done without those damn mutated dogs, what the (beep) was that all about. Inject Fluffy with the crap and Fluffy turns to Spike, anyway.</p></body></html>

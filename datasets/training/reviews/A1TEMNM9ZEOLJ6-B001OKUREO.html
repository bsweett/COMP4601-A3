Bush, whose presidency looks more and more fantasmagorical in retrospect. Almost every actor here looks virtually just like the real thing, except perhaps the first George HW Bush and his wife, Barbara, and Laura Bush, who looks way better here than in person. Josh Brolin gets W just right, in almost every respect. Those who play Karl Rove, Condi Rice, George Tenet and especially Dick Cheney are spot on. Almost every scene plays out like something from a Bob Woodward book. Oliver Stone is adept at compressing these signature moments into a coherent whole, though the movie is told in a jump around style timewise. If the kids don't take this as historic gospel, it's ok to watch this for a laugh.</p></body></html>

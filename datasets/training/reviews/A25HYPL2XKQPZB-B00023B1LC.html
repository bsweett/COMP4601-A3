<meta name="summary" content="A Simple and Effective Thriller."></head><body><p>The Bourne Identity is probably the best movie I've seen this year because it is the most effective in achieving its purpose.  Matt Damon plays a superspy who has forgotten everything about his past.  On his quest to find out about himself, he must evade assassins and protect Marie and try and stay alive.<p>The plot isn't that important other than to answer the question of will Bourne find out who he is and why people are trying to kill him.  The on-location filming make this movie fun to watch, but the action scenes are the best parts.  They are filled with suspense and realistic violence.  This movie isn't filled with computer generated violence and special effects.  <p>It is a throwback to the old Bond movies of one-on-one cloak and dagger standoffs.  While taking a step back from the special effects, The Bourne Identity might be enjoyable to many people today who weren't alive when the goals of movies was to be bigger and better than the last.<p>I recommend this film to anyone looking for a good action/suspense thriller.</p></body></html>

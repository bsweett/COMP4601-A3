<meta name="summary" content="A comic book come true!"></head><body><p>Sin City is a stylish comic turned movie directed by Robert Rodriguez (From Dusk Till Dawn) and featuring a star-studded cast including Bruce Willis (Die Hard), Benecio Del Toro (Traffic), Jessica Alba (Honey), Mickey Rourke (Get Carter), Rutger Hauer (Nighthawks), Clive Owen (Closer), and Elijah Wood (the Lord Of The Rings trilogy). The movie also features cameos by Michael Clarke Duncan (The Green Mile), Josh Hartnett (Pearl Harbor), Michael Madsen (Kill Bill), Nick Stahl (Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines), Brittany Murphy (8 Mile) and many others. The film also features behind the scenes work by Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction) who revised some of the script and directed a few scenes.<br /><br />Sin City comes straight from the comic by Frank Miller, who also takes the helm as co-director. It's a gritty tale of lowlives caught up in disturbing tales of deception, crime and murder. What makes the movie so eccentric is the black and white effect in addition to the bizarre characters, especially Marv played by Rourke and Kevin played by Wood.<br /><br />I can tell that Sin City will be loved by many and hated by some, but it is bound to be one of the most memorable movies of the decade.<br /><br />Sin City is a comic book come true!<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />A</p></body></html>

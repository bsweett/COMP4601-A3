First, this is not the kind of movie that anyone thought would win Oscar's in the first place.  Second, people who REALLY want to see it will do so regardless of what anyone says and third, I had never seen the first two.<br /><br />However, I do feel it's worth noting that there were fits of surprising competence in the film, which plays like THE ROAD WARRIOR meets...well...a video game.  Despite the utter unoriginality of the story, it managed to be a fitfully entertaining, action packed, gore fest.<br /><br />I'll admit right now that I never totally understood the powers or backstory of Milla Jovovich's lead character.  Is she a human or a robot of some sort?  A clone?  She appears to have psychic (psionic) powers...but they were undefined for the uninitiated.  I certainly wouldn't have objected to a more thorough recap of past events then we're given...but I certainly had no trouble understanding that except for a few isolated pockets, zombies have taken over the world.  Evil quasi-government/industrial agencies are trying to affect a cure...but it's tough to tell what their motives are.  It's hard to believe they expect to make a PROFIT by marketing a cure...since there isn't an economy in place any more...yet they sure don't seem to be doing their research to benefit anyone but themselves.<br /><br />Jovovich's striking-looking lead character is reintroduced to the viewer as a loner, riding a motorcycle across an endless desert.  She stops at a ruined radio station, because she's picked up an SOS broadcast.  Apparently, she wants to help, but it turns out to have been a trap.  She's captured by a group that we so often see in these kinds of movies...the bikers who've gone bad.  They capture her and are prepared to feed her to a pack of zombie dogs...for no reason other than their own amusement.  The scene plays out like a sequence in a video game...but Jovovich's escape is well staged and sufficient to get the blood pumping.  The movie has gore, but doesn't dwell on it.  (I'm not saying it's for little kids...but I've sure seen worse, too.)<br /><br />Later, Jovovich meets ups with a rag-tag group of survivors, led by Oded Fehr and Ali Larter, looking pretty tough herself in her khakis.  This group could be the same folks Mel Gibson let to "the promised land" in ROAD WARRIOR...they've got reinforced buses and heck, even a gasoline tanker!  Too bad that gas has become nearly impossible to find.  The realize that they will have to brave a "big city" because they've drained all the gas in the small towns.  But big cities are where the zombies have congregated the most, naturally, so we anticipate a bloody showdown.<br />And the film delivers one.  They arrive in Las Vegas and immediately unleash hundreds of the hungry creatures.  Lots of shooting, lots of creative ways of killing zombies, lots of sad moments as one beloved character after another falls under a swarm of the flesh-eaters.  There is no originality to the idea...but again, it is staged with a sincerity and a visceral quality that make it work.  (An earlier scene, involving an attack by a flock of infected ravens shows more originality, and also works well.)<br /><br />So the action is good.  The "quiet" scenes of dialogue are pretty hokey...but the actor's play them about as well as anyone could.  The movie doesn't "wink" at the audience at any time, nor does it have any "in-jokes."  It is a straightforward videogame brought to life.<br />The final scenes, involving a confrontation between Jovovich and a diabolical doctor...are perfunctory and not as fun as the scenes earlier in the film.  If we had more invested in this character, I think it might be different, but just because she's now starred in three films doesn't exactly make her the fleshed out person that, say, Hellboy has become.<br />Jovovich is well suited to the role.  She looks great in her silly costume.  And even though a few of her stunts clearly benefit from the aid of wires...she mostly looks like she could be doing what she does without help.  Larter matches her well, and Fehr (THE MUMMY RETURNS) is always a striking figure.<br /><br />The movie is far from the embarrassment I thought it would be.  While I can't simply heartily recommend it...I do think if you're looking for some good, "clean" zombie killing action...you could do worse!</p></body></html>

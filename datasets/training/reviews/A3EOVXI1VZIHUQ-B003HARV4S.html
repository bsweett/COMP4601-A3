I hadn't heard very much hype about it and the trailer didn't really send me running out to see it, but after watching it, I think it was one of the best movies of 2006.<br /><br />Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti, Rufus Sewell, and even Jessica Biel all turned in remarkable performances throughout the film. The entire supporting cast steps up as well. The cinematography was equally stunning, as was the story, which stays intriguing until the very last frame.<br /><br />The Illusionist is a romantic drama, a thriller, a mystery, and a period piece all in one, and it never leans too heavily on any of the genres in order to skate by. It lives in all these realms, but it also lives in its own independent category.<br /><br />The special features on the DVD were pretty meager: a making of featurette, and then a "Jessica Biel on the Illusionist" featurette that was really just the same comments she made in the making of featurette edited down to a shorter version. The film itself is so amazing that the DVD doesn't really need any extras, although it would be nice to get a more in depth look at Edward Norton's preperation for the role, and the magicians that trained him.</p></body></html>

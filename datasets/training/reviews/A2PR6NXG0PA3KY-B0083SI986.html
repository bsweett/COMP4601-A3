<meta name="summary" content="Was He YOUR Father, too?"></head><body><p>I should have saved Gran Torino for Father's Day, this coming weekend, and watched it together with my son, maybe as a double feature with The Great Santini. Looking over the reviews of this film here on the Big River, I find that the stars are closely correlated with the reminiscences of ornery old bustard fathers. Mine was one. In fact, my Dad looked almost exactly like Walt Kowalsky, Eastwood's character, at the same age. He dressed the same, walked the same, drank almost the same (slightly better taste in beer), and definitely hated the same. Only his accent was different -- my Dad's -- being a weird acquired country-western drawl on top of his still-Swedish pronunciation. He worshiped, like Kowalski, in the great American Church on Wheels; he was a car mechanic most of his life, and he had a Plymouth Barracuda that he cared for more tenderly than either of his two children. He was washing his car one afternoon, at age 91, when he had a stroke and died with the hose running. Neighbors found him a few hours later when the water started to flood their yard. Those neighbors were Salvadore&ntilde;os rather than Hmong, as in Eastwood's film, but the neighborhood dynamics were equivalent.<br /><br />Some critics have 'explained' Walt Kowalsky's bitter racism and self-hatred as the consequence of his experiences in the Korean War. Eastwood himself expresses that through his character's mouth and through the starchy dialogue between Walt and the young priest who tries to 'understand' him. Honestly, I don't think the atrocities of war were necessary to create a Walt Kowalsky. My father was of an age to have fought in WW2, but he didn't. He dodged, and the rest of his life he did his best to pretend he hadn't. In the '60s, he "disowned" me - temporarily - for refusing service in Viet Nam. I see this exoneration of Walt Kowalsky, as a victim of PTSD, as a slight weakness in the concept of Gran Torino, a too-easy excuse for the racism and xenophobia of "our" fathers' generation(s).<br /><br />The most touching moment of Gran Torino comes when Walt murmurs that he feels more in common with his g**k neighbors than with his upwardly-mobile sons and their families. That's not a unique perception. Garrison Keillor has expressed it time and again in his Lake Wobegon sketches. Farmers in Iowa, according to NPR, have been finding themselves sharing more with their hired Guatemalan help than with their college-gone heirs; they end up selling the farm to the newcomers and staying on as guests.<br /><br />But my own father never had Walt Kowalsky's epiphany. Tragically, he remained a ranting rightwing racist till the end. The virtue of this film -- this re-examination of 'Dirty Harry' by the actor who made "dirty Harry' an iconic figure -- is Clint Eastwood's powerful affirmation of a new integrated America, the land where diversity and assimilation can be reconciled. I wish all our fathers had gone that route.<br /><br />Artistically, cinematographically, Eastwood's performance in the role of Kowalsky is the only five-star feature of Gran Torino. The script is no masterpiece, and the other actors range from "not bad" to "well, I've seen worse." Clint Eastwood is his own most iconic story, from his spaghetti westerns to his comedy surliness to his current confessional maturity. I wonder who has the film rights to produce "The Eastwood Chronicle" when he dies...</p></body></html>

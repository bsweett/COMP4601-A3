<meta name="summary" content="solid action scenes, built around an unoriginal story with absolutely no substance..."></head><body><p>Slick and flashy, and with some solid acting performances, Eagle Eye (2008) has some good things going for it, but lacking an intelligent plot, the film takes you on an exciting ride, only to leave you with a hollow unsatisfying finish.  The story is completely unbelievable, terribly ridiculous, far more complicated than it needs to be, and seems obsessed with displaying the marvels of technology.  Spoilers follow, so proceed as you will.<br /><br />The premise of a master computer running amok has been explored before, in films like 2001 (1968), Colossus: The Forbin Project (1970), and War Games (1983), just to name a few.  Eagle Eye follows along similar lines, as an incredibly sophisticated government computer named ARIA has become misguided, and has instituted an overly complex and intricate set of operations, intended to eliminate the President and most of the cabinet.  ARIA has the ability to do some amazing things, but instead of taking a more straightforward approach, "she" takes a most obscure and roundabout route to accomplishing its mission.<br /><br />Chicago resident Jerry Shaw (Shia LeBeouf), is drawn into ARIA's scheme, after his twin brother Ethan, an Air Force officer who works with ARIA, is killed.  Jerry is arrested by the FBI as a suspected terrorist, and questioned by special agent Tom Morgan (Billy Bob Thornton).  In a device that quickly becomes overused, Jerry receives phone calls and other forms of messages from ARIA, giving him directions, or pointers on how to evade capture.  With ARIA's guidance, Jerry escapes from FBI custody, and hooks up with Rachel Holloman (Michelle Monahan), who is also following ARIA's instructions, in order to save her son's life.<br /><br />The pair survives a wild car chase, and then travel from Chicago to Indianapolis, where they commit an armed robbery.  Morgan is not far behind, and almost catches them after a circuitous pursuit through the baggage handling system at the Dayton airport.  Monahan and LaBeouf work well together, and their characters behave in a mostly plausible manner, despite being put a series of extremely ridiculous and convoluted gyrations, on their way to the Pentagon.  Thornton is also very solid, as the dogged FBI agent.<br /><br />The script goes to great lengths attempting to be clever, and amaze the viewer with ARIA's capabilities, but instead it mostly comes off as being gimmicky, extremely silly, and lacking any believability.  The worst aspect probably concerns ARIA itself, a high tech monstrosity with crazy architecture that is cooled by liquid nitrogen.  Like nearly every mega-computer in a Hollywood movie, the computer speaks in a human voice (in this case Julianne Moore's), describing step by step what it is doing, or what is happening.  Computer speech is just a plot device that has simply been done to death, as has the master computer gone wild idea.<br /><br />Eagle Eye features some good acting performances, and nicely executed action scenes, but the story that ties them together is unoriginal and without much substance.  Like many big budget Hollywood productions, the approach is to dazzle the audience, so that they don't notice that the cool thing they are watching, makes little sense within the context of the story.  Eagle Eye certainly does entertain, but the adventure that you are supposed to be intrigued by and be invested in, is actually ridiculously laughable fluff.  This one rates 2.5 stars.</p></body></html>

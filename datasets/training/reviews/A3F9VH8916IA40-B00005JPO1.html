<meta name="summary" content="A little different for Indiana Jones, but still a solid entry"></head><body><p>Well it's not as good as Raiders of the Lost Ark or The Last Crusade, but Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Skull is still better then The Temple of Doom and will stand proud with its predecessors as a solid action flick living up to an American icon. This long awaited final chapter to the story of treasure hunter Harry "Indiana" Jones Jr. may not live up to the greatness which were the first and third entries, but don't let a simple comparison ruin the fun of this fourth movie; on its own merits it still stands well enough on its own two feet, even if it isn't a masterpiece.<br /><br />The film starts off with a convoy of troops driving down a large road in Nevada while a gang of kids trail behind. The convoy pulls into a military base which is closed for a military test, but little do the guards know that these are actually Soviet KGB agents come to steal the treasures of some old military warehouse, the same one we saw the Ark go into at the end of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Indi is in the trunk of the car. Oh no, what kind of trouble has our hero gotten himself into this time? On the hanger doors of the building a large 51 is painted in black letters. Surly this couldn't be the infamous area 51. Or could it?<br /><br />Okay, I'll stop right there so not to give away too much of the films premise, but as I said in the title this is a VERY different movie then the kind we're used to seeing for Indiana Jones. Gone are the Nazis and biblical artifacts, here come the Russians and the cold war. One of the things I found very entertaining about this film was the harkening back to the 50's, the cold war red scares, the double agents, the talks of aliens and such, very much like the old films from that time. It really brings to light that this is a different time period then the previous films, this is the beginning of the cold war, and darn it we're going to have some cold war fun. From jet engines, to demonstrators marching down the street with signs saying "better dead then red," this movie really pokes fun at all the scares and worries of that time period. We even get to see the detonation of an atomic bomb in one hilarious sequence of events which involve Indiana climbing into a refrigerator. I'm telling you that is one of the greatest scenes in any Indi film ever.<br /><br />Now I know what's on everyone's minds, you want to know if Harrison Ford can still pull off his old jump around and whip people routine. Well I'll let you know that, no, there isn't as much action in this film as there is in some of the older ones but what action did make its way into this film is quality stuff. No worries here my friend, Ford is still as good as he was in his prime. Fortunately Ford doesn't have to do all the work in this film, he has some help from Mutt, a new character who ------------ oh, sorry about that, I forgot, you all don't like spoilers. Okay, fine.<br /><br />I'm pretty sure they wrote his part into the film not because it would make it more interesting (although it does) or that it would deepen the plot (but it still does), I have the sneaky suspicion that he was put in to take the strain off of Fords back. Well no problem because Shia LaBeouf can pull off the action hero pretty well. I've never liked him very much, but here his performance was right on Q, giving us a LOT of comic relief and a healthy dose of action. Oh yeah, the action; well its solid. Three words for you buddy, REALLY BIG ANTS!!! Remember the scene in Raiders where that Nazi got chopped up in the airplane blades? Well this scene is a combination of that and that one scene in the first Mummy movie where the guy got eaten by bugs, only it's a Soviet getting killed and their in the Amazon, not Egypt. From Ford jumping back and forth on moving cars, to LaBeouf showing off his best Tarzan impersonation, the action leaves little to be desired.<br /><br />So how about negatives? Well, as I said, it's strange, maybe a little too strange for its own good. Why not stick to what we know? I hear Lucas wanted to do something even stranger then this but Spielberg and Ford had to talked him out of it, and at this point I'm really glad they did because there is no telling what he would have done had no one gad been there to knock some sense into him. Maybe that's why his new Star Wars movies were so bad. I know it's an Indiana Jones movie and I have to suspend my belief if I'm going to enjoy it, but please, don't push it. There are also a few inconsistencies in the plot, some characters who are less then believable, and maybe one too many "look at this really cool special effect" type shots, but I'll leave that judgment up to you.<br /><br />So for all you die hard fans wondering if this new entry will live up to expectations, just go in expecting something slightly better then Temple of Doom but maybe not as good as the two other films and you'll be alright. For everyone else, just sit back and enjoy. This is, after all, an Indiana Jones film.<br /><br />Replay value; High.</p></body></html>

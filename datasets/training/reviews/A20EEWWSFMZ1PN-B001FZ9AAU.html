<meta name="summary" content="You've got to have heart, Tony Stark does/did/does"></head><body><p>Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) military/industrial weapons mogul just finished demonstrating his newest rocket in the Middle East, when he is purloined by ruthless locals with dirty faces and a penchant for power. Who could be behind the dastardly deed? Of course everyone knows it is the last person you would suspect as in any good mystery.<br /><br />Well as luck would have it, in Starks efforts to escape he invents the fundamental technology for, you guessed it, Ironman. In the process he inadvertently gives the world a new weapon. How can he correct his faux pax?<br /><br />In his quest for the answers he solicits the help of his very efficient and devoted assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow.)<br /><br />For those enthralled in the Ironman comics, nothing has changed; except maybe the storyline. O.K the era in which how superhero exists. Well maybe a tad more gratuities sex. O.K. I guess I could go on for a few more paragraphs but you get the picture that we can not rely on the comic book character to be anymore than an inspiration for this movie.<br /><br />For people that are more music orientated, among the popular background songs they included the original theme from the animated series.<br /><br />It has all the formula and characters for today's super hero movies. By not making it a period piece we get to incorporate all the latest technology and social attitudes.<br /><br />Only saw the Blu-Ray version. Had the standard extras and flexibility. I am pretty sure future versions will add more insight or at least more footage.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006IIPIK">Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (Widescreen Special Collector's Edition)</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005OCMR">Tron (20th Anniversary Collector's Edition)</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OPPBEQ">The Ultimate Matrix Collection [Blu-ray</a>]</p></body></html>

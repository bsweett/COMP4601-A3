<meta name="summary" content="One Of The Best Comic Book Characters To Film Creations Ever"></head><body><p>X2 is a great movie, and this DVD is loaded with extras.  I waited way too long to finally take a look at this film.<br /><br />Director Bryan Singer did a great job, even better than the first X-Men, creating a movie that even people who know nothing about the X-men comic books will enjoy.  This movie draws the viewer right into the plot and keeps them on the edge of their seat.  The fight scenes are amazing, the characters have addictive personalities, and the story flows at just the right pace.<br /><br />Charles Xavier/Prof. X is played, of course and once again, by Patrick Stewart.  His character really doesn't have a lot of EXCITING parts, but the X-Men need a leader, and he fits the bill.  Stewart is very believable in this role.  We may see a little too much of him though, since the other characters are so much more interesting.<br /><br />Logan/Wolverine is played by Hugh Jackman.  He is absolutely perfect in his part.  I can't picture anyone else playing Wolverine.  His character only has a few moments that fall a little short of believable, like when he is seeking out William Stryker's hideout but doesn't think about the fact that it might be underground - even though the mutant school has a plane under the basketball court...go figure.  The other part that left me scratchin' my head was when the kids at mutant high store their Coke and Pepsi in a non-refrigerated cabinet even though they have a gi-normous refrigerator in the kitchen.  This was added to the script just to have Ice Man / Bobby Drake show his chillin' powers.  Scenes like that did not need to be forced into the movie - the viewers are not morons.  Other than those two very small mistakes, I found the scriptwriting for Wolverine to be better than I could have ever dreamed!  Zak Penn and David Hayter know how to write!  Great job, guys.<br /><br />Ian McKellen plays Eric Lensherr/Magneto.  He is fantastic in his role.  I really believe this guy thinks he is a mutant!<br /><br />Halle Berry manages to hole her own as Storm/Ororo Munroe, but I think she could have pushed a little more spice into her character.  Better than Cat---, oh, I won't even go there....<br /><br />Famke Janssen is very believable as Jean Grey, but how exciting is it to watch mind-powers?  It would have been cool to see her in more action scenes, like tossing people around with tele-whatever.<br /><br />James Marsden plays Scott Summers/Cyclops.  I never realized how hard it is to relate to a character when you can't see their eyes.  He did a great job in a part where you can't tell where the heck he is looking!  That cannot be an easy role.  Maybe I should ask Jamie Foxx how tough it is?<br /><br />Anna Paquin nails the role of Rogue.  She was absolutely born to play that role.  Talk about a comic book character coming to life - she did just that.<br /><br />Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is Mystique from this day forward.  She could almost jump this movie to an R rating.  Mutants aren't all bad. :-)<br /><br />William Stryker is played by Brian Cox.  What a jerk!  I think that is what he was going after, so good show ole' chap.<br /><br />Alan Cumming plays Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler, one of the most memorable roles I have ever seen.  Man, this guy is one of THE best actors in the world today.  The directing, the acting, and the stunts involved with Nightcrawler are superb.  Everyone involved with the development and end-result of this character should pat themselves on the back.  I was totally impressed!<br /><br />Yuriko Oyama/Deathstrike is played by Kelly Hu.  Hu really grabs the screen at first knuckle crack!  She has that IT factor so many stars strive for.  She fit the role of Deathstrike better than the orignal concept turned out.  You rock, Kelly!<br /><br />The plot is pretty simple:  Bad guy hates mutants, he wants them to be blamed for an attack on the president, the mutants find out the truth, and both sides are trying to stop the other before it is too late.  Some times, simple works best!  Like in X2's case.<br /><br />X2 DVD deliver the goods.  Bryan Singer is an amazing director, gifted with the ability to make films that go beyond the usual expectations.<br /><br />See ya next review.</p></body></html>

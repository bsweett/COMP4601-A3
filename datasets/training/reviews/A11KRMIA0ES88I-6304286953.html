<meta name="summary" content="An American Werewolf in London"></head><body><p>Another cult film with Jenny Agutter. She nurses a guy turning into a werewolf. The movie parodies itself. Moon songs are played. The best is Bad Moon Rising by Creedence Clearwater Revival. John Fogerty of CCR wrote 20 rock classics including Proud Mary and Green River. The scene where David Naughton turns into a werewolf is disturbing. Jenny Agutter has had some weird love interest. In Walkabout, she is with an aborigine. In Logan's Run, it is a Sandman. In Othello, it is Shakespeare's black soldier. Here, it is a werewolf.</p></body></html>

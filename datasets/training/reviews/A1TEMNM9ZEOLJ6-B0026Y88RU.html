Lucy Liu got on my nerves as a little too chirpy. Morgan Freeman and Sir Ben Kingsley are somewhat wasted on the material, which is a revenge plot fantasy adventure. The cutting is little too frenetic at times. But at least the plot makes sense. As Hollywood hokum, not too bad, really.</p></body></html>

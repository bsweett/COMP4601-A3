<meta name="summary" content="A classic action film"></head><body><p>"Die Hard" is one of the best action films of all time. When I think about the best action films of all time, I think "First Blood", "Die Hard" and "The Terminator". In all three of these films, a big reason why they did so well was because they had a good plot and the star of each film did a phenomenal job.<br /><br />"Die Hard" is about New York cop John McClane (Willis). It is Christmas so he is visiting his wife who lives in California (because of a job she could not turn down). McClane goes to the building where she works, because there is a party going on there and his wife Holly has to give a speech. While McClane was in a back room washing up, he heard gun shots. With being a cop McClane goes to the top floor of the building "Nakatomi Plaza", he finds out that terrorist have taken control of the building and he is the only chance the hostages have.<br /><br />Bruce Willis did a wonderful job acting in this film. In my opinion Willis should have won best actor for this role.<br />If you are a fan of action films, "Die Hard" is a must see.</p></body></html>

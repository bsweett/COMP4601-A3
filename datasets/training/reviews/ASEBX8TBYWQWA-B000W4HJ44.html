<meta name="summary" content=""You  CAN'T Stop the Beat" with this DVD version of the movie!"></head><body><p>I became a huge John Waters fan after his original film version of "Hairspray" hit the big screen. Then came "Cry Baby" which was nearly as good. Waters lived through these years in Baltimore and wrote what he saw with a bit of a "twist".  When the DVD of Water's "Hairspray" came out on DVD I raved about it, mainly `cause it now had his commentary - which was hilarious.<br /><br />The Broadway musical version of "Hairspray" takes Waters' original and pumps up the energy a few notches and then - through set design and costume makes it more colorful than one could expect. Mark Shaiman's music is so full of hooks that you will find yourself humming along on first viewing and then trying to get the tunes out of your head for days. And the lyrics - while not written by Waters sure capture his sense of humor.<br /><br />There are two versions of the DVD out there. One is a bare bones single disc. But this two-Disc version is the one to buy. The "extras" are hours and hours long! There are TWO separate full-length commentaries (sadly Waters is on neither of them) plus five deleted scenes. There a 35 minute or so "making of" documentary and a fabulous three part "Roots of Hairspray" featurette that gives background on Waters and his films  as well as a nice look at Buddy Dean - the actual Baltimore TV dance party host that the "Hairspray" character Corny Collins is patterned after.  There's a featurette on the dance numbers performed and - my favorite - the Sing Along "Karaoke" feature. There's few more bonuses as well that are minor.<br /><br />This is a great "Generation Gap" film and DVD. Those in their 60s will remember the early days of "Bandstand" (even before it became "American Bandstand" and those in their teens and 20s can see what it was like in America during the time both before, and after, racial integration. Used as a springboard for discussions about "what it was like growing up then" between parents and their teens, this is a great way to share some common entertainment. After all, the  dance party shows of the 60s are not that much different than the Disney Channel "High School Musical" shows of the current day.<br /><br />All the major stores seem to be promoting sales in this new release and so the prices will come way down. Take a chance. Then, just TRY to stop getting the songs out of your head!<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />"Anything Phonographic"</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="incredible acting, highly disturbing story"></head><body><p>I was in angst how to rate this film... my knee-jerk reaction was to give  it 5 stars because of the realistic portrayal of a sick serial killer and  the incredible acting by every member of the cast.  The film was finely  filmed and put together and the acting was flawless, but on the overall  star meter I have to ask myself, &quot;Would I ever recommend this film to  anybody, anywhere, under any circumstances?&quot; And the resounding answer  is &quot;No!&quot;  <p>I saw it a few years ago when so many people made  such a big deal on how good it was. And good it was indeed, but it has to  be one of the most sick, disturbing films I have ever seen. I continued to  ask myself, &quot;Why?&quot; Why would anyone feel compelled to make a  movie like this?  It offers no solutions, no social redeeming values, it  doesn't educate, it just reviles and sickens and brings out the worst in  humanity.  I've seen some sick &amp; twisted films before, but never have I  felt so covered with mind filth as when I finished watching this horrific  nightmare of a tale that is too real in light of today's violent society.  <p>Kevin Spacey is bone-chilling as he portrays the sick serial killer who  is out to dispense judgement to those who commit the seven deadly sins. His  twisted, perverted mind is very like that of a real serial killer who has  their own perception of right and wrong, not realizing how deceived they've  become.  <p>The search to find the killer keeps you on your toes, but the  ending is very predictable and the movie itself is a disgusting heap of  violence, blood, sinew and twisted sexual perversion.  I have got images  dancing around in my head since seeing this film that I can not remove. If  I had known how awful this experience would have been, I would have avoided  the film altogether.<p>Film students and horror &amp; mystery buffs may  still enjoy it (especially if they have cast iron stomachs) and fans of  Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey will not be let down by their masterful  performances -- BUT I feel compelled to warn anyone who has yet to see this  film... THINK, think very long and hard if this is a film you feel like you  can not live without seeing. Frankly, I would have been better off as a  human being had I not seen it, and I certainly could never watch this  again.  To say the least, this is not a film for kids... but in my opinion,  it's not a film for people of any age.</p></body></html>

Two of them came out in 2003 (one was full-screen, the other widescreen). The one discussed in my review will be the newest one.<br /><br />All the films are in widescreen format and each come with a behind the scenes look at each film along with other extras too numerous to mention here.<br /><br />Now, for my opinions of each:<br /><br />RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK - Indiana Jones races to get the legendary Ark Of The Covenant from the hands of the Nazis. Along the way, he encounters an old flame from the past which is revisited in the fourth film "Kingdom Of The Krystal Skull."<br /><br />TEMPLE OF DOOM - After nearly escaping death from a chinese gang, Indiana Jones crash lands in India with singer Willie Scott and a little chinese kid named Short Round. Seeing the plight of these people, he agrees to help them save their children from slavery and recover their Shakara stone from an occult group.<br /><br />It should be fair to note that this film, while fun, is the darkest of the three that are out so far and some parts may not be suitable for kids.<br /><br />THE LAST CRUSADE - While trying to find his missing father (played by Sean Connery), Indiana Jones becomes involved in a chase for the cup of Christ. The very cup that Jesus drank from at the last supper before his crucifixion. Again, he goes against the Nazis in this two mission race.<br /><br />All three films are great thrill rides in my view! I am personally biased towards Temple Of Doom but all of them are great. I also think these film put Harrison Ford's name on the map, moreso than Star Wars did (only my opinion).<br /><br />Anyway, if you haven't bought the original box sets, then pick up the new one! Worth the buy!</p></body></html>

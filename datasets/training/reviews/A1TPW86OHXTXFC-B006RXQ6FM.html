The gem of them all is Meryl Streep as Sister Aloysius, "Ms. Streep blows in like a storm, shaking up the story's reverential solemnity with gusts of energy and comedy. The performance may make no sense in the context of the rest of the film, but it is -- forgive me, Father -- gratifying nunsense"<br />Manohla Dargis<br /><br />Doubt as we all know, and as Father Flynn played by Philip Seymour Hoffman, reminds us in a sermon is ambiguity, that land between black and white. Sister Aloysius is a nun from the old school, stern and severe, no nonsense, and underneath, rarely does the real person shows through. She is the Principal of the school, St Nicholas, and everything is done and run by her. Sister James, Amy Adams, once remarks that the school is like a jail- the students are afraid and intimidated by Sister Aloysius. "That's as it should be," answers, Sister Aloysius. She gives great latitude to Sister  James, could it be she sees in her a younger, truer image of herself? We find out as time goes on that Sister Aloysius was once married, but her husband was killed during the war. Meryl Streep is delicious in this role, her accent so true to the times and the Bronx.<br /><br />Sister James is an innocent. She believes life is good and fair and just and it is up to Sister Aloysius to teach her the ropes. But, Sister James comes through in flying colors, and she is the embodiment of every teacher we have ever loved.<br /><br />Father Flynn, he of such great depth and charm and warmth. All he wants to do is to bring some reform to the school. To lighten up the dark, bring some modern fun and times to the school. And, then he is accused.<br /><br />Donald, the only black child in the school. He is not scorned by his classmates, but left to go on his own. He is befriended by Father Flynn. A boy needs a role model.<br /><br />Donald's mother, Mrs Mullen, played by Viola Davis, is a loving mother, and she only wants the best for her child. Donald only needs until June when he graduates and can get into a good college and be on his way. Donald's mother and Sister Aloysius have one of the pivotal moments in this film, and Viola Davis is superb. She blows the scene away with her acting.<br /><br />John Patrick  Shaley, the writer and director portrays the school of his youth in real terms. He returns to his neighborhood, uses some of his old child hood friends as extras and brings the Catholic childhood of his youth to life. He first wrote the play and it appeared on Broadway to rave reviews.<br /><br />There are few things in this film that are for certain. One of them may be the absolute powerlessness of women in the Church. The men are protected and the women wait on them.  Oh, really? We all have doubts, we are sure at times we know who is right and who is wrong, and then the film twists this all around and up and down.  This film has one of the few times when all of us, in unison, gasp at what we have just seen. There is no doubt that this film is extraordinary. It is a film that kept me spellbound.<br /><br />Highly, Highly Recommended.  prisrob 04-11-08<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000068MBW">"...First Do No Harm"</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018M6J90">Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day (Widescreen & Full Screen Edition)</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000BXMZ8">Owning Mahowny</a></p></body></html>

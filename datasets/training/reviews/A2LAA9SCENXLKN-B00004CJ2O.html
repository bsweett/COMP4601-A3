<meta name="summary" content="ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER MADE!!!!"></head><body><p>For all my reviews visit my website<br /><br />I am NOT reviewing the special features. However, this is coming from watching the uncut version. However again, I'm not comparing the original with the uncut version. This is simply from the perspective of the uncut version.<br /><br />Please note that the rating above is possibly skewed by the ratings on this specific site. There might be a slightly different rating at the end.<br /><br />...I just had an injection of epicness, and now I went into shell shock.<br /><br />From start to finish, this movie has just about everything you would expect, and everything you wouldn't expect, out of a slasher film. Welcome to Friday the 13th A-Thon, during the whole month of Halloween. What is really great about the whole movie, is the sense of mystery. Any time there's a kill, we see it in first person, so we don't know who the he11 is the killer. Probably most of you would know, but I'm gonna not spoil in until I have to. You wanna know, yet you know it's better if you don't know. But that's the awesome part. It makes you want to keep watching the movie, that's what a good movie does!! And when you actually find out who the killer is, man, are you in shock. And they do it such an awesome fashion, which I'm gonna try to not spoil, that you are just ready to get your adrenalin pumping!!!<br /><br />But then, it does something you don't expect it to. Go Alien (1979) style, and have what 3-8 minute moments of tension building (which is extremely genius,) and then finally relieve you and make you think for just the right amount of time "it's safe..." and the BOOMZA!!! Something scary comes out. And it's not just something stupid, it's someone who's been killed most of the time. Not the killer. But sometimes it is the killer, but it's done extremely well. Not to mention, even watching the Unrated version, it's not blood soaked like people make it out to be. Rather, it is just blood dipped. Like a DQ Ice Cream Cone with Chocolate. It doesn't over-power the substance, but there's just enough to make you want it every time you go to Diary Queen. And, the creep factor. I swear to God, this movie is all in the dark. It is one of the creepiest movies I've ever seen. The Chi Chi Ha Ha. Perfection! This movie is so extremely awesomely epic epic of epicaheness on so many freaking levels!!!<br /><br />It's got a great "camp" value. The characters aren't the chessyness though. No, the characters are actually extremely awesome (too bad I don't remember their names.) They're funny, they're likable, they're relatable, they're awesome. As you might of guessed, it's the dialogue. But not in the "so bad it's good" sense. More like the "so good it's bad" kinda sense. "Crocodile in the Cabinet." Such an awesome line. This movie has some of the best lines in all of cheesy horror movie history! But this isn't cheesy, this is a mysterious blood deep tension building creepy dramatic beautiful innovative significant MASTERPIECE!!!! (And not to mention it teaches you not to hitchhike.) Speaking of which, in that hitchhiking scene, it kills off the character we think is going to be the star (and I didn't spoil anything for you.) Just like A Nightmare on Elm Street (BOTH VERSIONS.) Not to mention, I never would have predicted a creepy stranger in such a campy car.<br /><br />Most people think having $3X is a natural thing for a killer to put on his "MUST KILL" list. Nope, that is not the villains motivation at all. The $3X scenes are completely useless. (Which takes .05 points off.) (Or, as you would say, .1%) It does become a part of the movie though. These are the rules that you must follow in order to live. Rule #1: Don't wash anything in the sink (to evolve into don't take a shower.) Rule #2: Never Sleep. Rule #3: Don't have $3X. And Rule #4: Don't be in any position that might piss off the killer. (Like, if the villain once got abused by a Police Officer, don't be a Police Officer.) And Rule #5: When someone says they're a messenger of God, THEY'RE A FREAKING MESSENGER OF GOD!!! Onto the next part, do you ever notice that only one of the teenagers reacts to seeing her friends die before her eyes?<br /><br />Also, would you expect a Slasher Film to have a freaking amazing score? It's two steps away from Phillip Glass standards. Just buy the soundtrack, if it's available. If it's not, screw Paramount, they didn't know what they were doing. There's a lot more I want to talk about, but I HAFT to save it for the next review if I wish not to spoil anything. So overall, this is A FREAKING MASTERPIECE. What a wonderful film, it will leave you shaken with shell shock, yet at the same time leave you with a new FREAKING PERSPECTIVE ON LIFE!!! 5.95/5!!!!</p></body></html>

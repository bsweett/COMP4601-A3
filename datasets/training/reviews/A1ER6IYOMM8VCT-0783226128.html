They did add some sound effects, but it was not enough for me to buy another version of this movie. If you don't own the anniversay then buy the new one,but if you do own it, don't bother. The movie itself is excellent and one of Pacino's most famous and greatest roles. A excellent supporting cast and well written script round out one of the best gangster films of all time! The anniversary edition has an excellent transfer and some interesting extras.</p></body></html>

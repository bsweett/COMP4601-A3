<meta name="summary" content="a remake worth watching"></head><body><p>While everyone else claims that *Friday the 13th* or *Nightmare on Elm Street* is their favorite horror series, mine is *Halloween*.  My favorite is Part II where Michael is trying to kill his sister at the hospital.  Throw in Jamie Lee Curtis, I'm sold!<br /><br />But I digress.<br /><br />I have to admit that while I've watched Rob Zombie's other movies, none of them have been remarkable for me.  However, this remake of Halloween has certainly gotten my attention.<br /><br />What I love about this remake is that there are background information added to the story.  For example, how Michael came to be this "immortal" serial killer.  Rob Zombie takes us back to Michael's childhood.  It seems that Michael has always been a bad seed, limiting his evil deeds with just mutilating animals.  The monster in him emerges when he reaches a breaking point with his classmates bullying him, his mother always working, the mother's boyfriend constantly picking on him, and his older sister neglecting him for her boyfriend.  Only his innocent baby sister escapes his rage.<br /><br />Years later, we see Michael breaking out of an asylum.  What's freaky is that Michael is this huge guy, about 6'8".  Michael makes those WWF guys look like sissies.  So, can you imagine facing a serial killer with that kind of build?  That's enough to scare the nine lives outta you.  (I know, I know...we're not cats.)<br /><br />Anyways, if you've seen the original in regards to Michael's return to Haddonfield, you'll start to connect the missing pieces that Rob Zombie presents with what you can remember (from John Carpenter's film).  From that point on, the movie becomes entertaining and scary.</p></body></html>

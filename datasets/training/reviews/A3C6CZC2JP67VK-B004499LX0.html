<meta name="summary" content="Cupid has left the building between these two couples"></head><body><p>This is one of those movies that critics invariably describe as "brutally honest," which is determined to peel back the mask of Hollywood's romantic lies and show that deep down, people are cruel, love is a sham, and the world is a cold, hard place. Oh, yeah: And the only honest women in this world are strippers and whores. Don't forget that one.<br /><br />Julia Roberts gives us one of her best performance in this film. She is cold, confused, depressed - a lost woman. A woman who wants children. A woman who wants love, but doesn't even know love herself and doesn't realize it when she has it (this goes true for all the characters). Clive Owen is a scene stealer, with the showiest role. Jude Law has shown shades of this character before. Natalie Portman is sexy, mysterious, and vulnerable.<br /><br />This movie has its flaws but Mike Nichols somehow makes it watch able, even intriguing, for the most part, exploring the unpredictable and unconstant nature of lust, attraction and desire and how relationships can waver in intensity and lose their moorings over time.<br /><br />Not a movie for fans of happy endings and have everything spelled out for them. In this film love is the dirtiest word.<br />Being that this movie again is brutal, emotionally draining,and humorous at times it is a polarizing film. I would recommend this DVD for mature adults.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="MORE WILD HARRY"></head><body><p>This second installment in the immensely popular series once again delivers a world of fantastic magical proportions.  Most of the members of the original movie are back and once again director Chris Columbus weaves a tale of sorcery and danger for our young heroes.  Notable new faces include a bombastic Kenneth Branagh and a nasty Jason Isaacs.  With gorgeous sets, costumes and neat special effects, this movie should entertain all, even those of us who aren't Harry Potterphiles.  Good moviemaking, though</p></body></html>

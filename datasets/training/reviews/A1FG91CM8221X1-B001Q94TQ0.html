<meta name="summary" content="A brutal, noble, beautiful film."></head><body><p>To American audiences lulled by action flicks and insipid teen comedies, Joshua Marston's "Maria Full of Grace" is a bucket of cold water in the face. Shot in jittery, cinema-verite fashion, it tells the story of Maria Alvarez, a spirited young woman facing dead-end prospects in her small Colombian town, who takes the only apparent way out--signing on as a drug mule, swallowing packets of heroin and transporting them in her stomach from Bogota to New York. And thus, as Marston makes brutally plain, she leaps from the frying pan into the fire. Writer-drector Marston passes no judgment on Maria, though surely everyone who sees this film will feel renewed loathing for the drug trade. Maria is a headstrong but decent and moral young woman, whose only real crime is having been born into a world in which the deck is always stacked against her. As Maria, Catalina Sandino Moreno gives a beautiful, heartbreaking performance. Her final scene--in which Maria comes to a decision that leaves her well and truly alone--will haunt you for a long time. "Maria Full of Grace" may well be the best film ever made about illegal immigrants to the U.S.; in my opinion, it deserves comparison with "Umberto D," "The Bicycle Thief," and other classics of Neo-Realism.</p></body></html>

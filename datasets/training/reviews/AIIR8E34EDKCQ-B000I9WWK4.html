The speical effects are amazing! This movie can stand the test of time, because not once during the movie have I thought that anything looked fake, plastic or not believable.<br /><br />Kurt Russel and the crew are great, stranded on a work site in Antarctica, when the weather become cold, they have no outside contact and they discover an alien space skih and an intruder hiding in one of the men.<br /><br />The special features;, making of the movie, was fantastic! Over an hour long, it gave you true insight on how the movie was made. I would have bought the DVD alone just for that.<br /><br />This is great, scarry and keeps you in tip top suspence. Great horror flick!!!!!</p></body></html>

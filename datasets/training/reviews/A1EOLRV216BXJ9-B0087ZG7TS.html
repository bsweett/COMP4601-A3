The cinematography, the editing (twice with the same scene told from two different perspectives, one observed from Briony, the young sister and one showing what actually happened), the score (with typewriter providing the background sound) and the young sister's steadfast gaze and focused attitude all make an excellent presentation.<br /><br />Then the second hour moved to the war in 1940, both in Europe and in London. A drastic change in the mood. Visually stunning and touching. Especially when Vanessa Redgrave as the old Briony disclosed everything that happened after her lie in 1935 - the truth as well as what she had hoped for.<br /><br />I would say this is a good and thought provoking movie. But I can't help feeling what's holding it back from being a better one.<br /><br />(a)It's very Joe Wright - it bears too close a resemblance to Pride and Prejudice in the first hour, in portraying the life of the Tallis family in the English countryside. In so doing, the movie lacks its signature tone and is somehow masked by the director's previous work.<br /><br />(b)I wish I had not seen Pride and Prejudice and Miss Potter (with Keira Knightley, James Mcavoy and Brenda Blethyn already in the cast in addition to the same visually stunning portrayal of the English countryside). Atonement could then have made a refreshing and fluid story telling movie that stands out on its own.<br /><br />(c)While Saoirse Ronan (young Briony) and James Mcavoy (as Robbie) are superb, Keira Knightly (as Cecilia) is not in the same league. She has the beauty but somehow her determined and firm look make her inner feelings unable to surface completely, short of what Saoirse Ronan and James Mcavoy have achieved. She could have delivered more subtlety and depth to her character. Maybe some part of the Elizabeth (Pride and Prejudice) still lingers in her or maybe the director finds that already adequate? James Mcavoy, on the other hand, has pulled off a wonderful performance. Juno Temple (as Lola, Briony's cousin) is also impressive. She got to portray the young and the grown up Lola. It's unfortunate that Saiorse cannot do likewise and continue her captivating screen presence.<br /><br />That being said, Atonement is still worth watching. I am also more sympathetic to what Briony (the young sister) has done. Should Robbie and Cecilia have been more discreet in their younger days, Briony would not have to make such a difficult decision. So atonement, in some sense, needs not rest on Briony's shoulders alone.</p></body></html>

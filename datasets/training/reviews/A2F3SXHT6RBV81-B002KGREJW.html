<meta name="summary" content="Another No Title LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE.."></head><body><p>This was not your typical family, but it is more normal today than the average grouping.  Every one of them faces a great disappointment but hangs in together.  It is a comedic tragedy.  Greg Kinnear was superb as the long-suffering dad Richard who dictates that "a real loser is someone who is so afraid they don't try"; he feels that it is weak to apologize, and "winners never give up."  When his big project fell through because "nobody cares about an unknown," he was told that it is time to move on.<br /><br />The whole premise revolves around seven-year-old Olive preparing to compete in a beauty contest and her granddad who is the most unhappy of them all teaches her a peculiar talent.  Olive is a misnomer, more like an Ann Margaret.  She has been told to "will yourself to win."  Steve Carell was good as the disturbed Uncle Frank who had loved the wrong person.  I'm so glad you're still here, he was told, as he entered the family to rehab from a disastrous setback.  That too was said to me after my health scare in April by a stranger.  Sometimes, the words of wisdom we need to  hear come unexpectedly from strange sources.  I was upset and said something I shouldn't have said; later, I was upset and didn't mean the things I said.<br /><br />The grandfather was the core of the family, the voice of experience.  There is a "Bernie" connection here, as his body is stolen from the hospital in order to get Olive to the Miss Sunshine contest on time, still one hundred miles from L.A.  This family had to travel in an old yellow VW bus for 800 miles from Alburquerque.  After Pop's sudden death, the supportive mom tells them "we are family, what matters is that we love each other."  The funny thing is the way they show it.  At the hospital, Linda (all business) was the typical KAT driver:  he's not the only person to die here today!  On I10, out in California, the drivers were as bad as these in Knoxville and almost cause accidents with their aggressiveness.<br /><br />They had to make a quick stop out on the highway where there was an oil well and track homes near Los Angeles.  Olive was dressed as a Sunshine Girl (my favorite of Eddie Fisher's songs) in her red boots and pink shorts.  It was a wild ride without a clutch, but they made it and mom tells them to "pretend to be normal."  Carl Hampton Southcott was the host of the little Miss Sunshine pageant where all of the contestants with the exception of our Olive Hoover were experienced in this game and talented, but Olive was incredible with her vaudeville-style dancing.  She'd dedicated her being there to her dead grandad who had coached and showed her all the moves.<br /><br />Her brother raved at his mom that "a mother is supposed to protect" but this one had allowed the children to grow in the ways which were best for them and was most supportive.  The whole family got in the act, and a good time was had by all -- even the audience.  I haven't laughed that much since I saw (and reviewed) 'The Dukes of Hazard.'  Olive blossomed into an Olivia.  Go see the transformation; you won't be sorry you did.<br /><br />A lot happens during their long road trip and this movie is about those incidents and how the family dynamics build and rebuild during the journey. The movie starts with the three generations of Hoover family that includes Olive (played by Abigail Breslin), her brother (played by Paul Dano), Mom (played by Toni Collette), her Uncle Frank (played by Steve Carell), Grandpa (played by Alan Arkin) and Dad (played by Greg Kinnear). Little Miss Sunshine is hilarious and visual gag are fresh and funny. During the setup for the family's third trot, however, you think it can't possibly work again. Filmmakers Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton have the ability to gauge just how far they can go. The comedy in the movies seems to come out of nowhere.<br /><br />The Hoover family is a totally unique and dysfunctional family. Even though everybody is a little eccentric in this family, but every one of us will be able to relate to them. We will see ourselves or our family in them.<br />Olive, just like her father is an extremely pipe dreaming person. Her Dad is a motivational speaker who believes he can sell his `prosaic nine-step program for success' into a book and video. Similarly, Olive who has a fresh-scrubbed look and tiny potbelly thinks that she can beat a bunch of JonBenet Ramsey look-alikes.<br /><br />Her uncle has been put in her mother's care as he had attempted suicide after a fellow Proust scholar won a genius grant and stole his boyfriend. As he is still on suicide watch, he has to accompany Hoover to the contest also. Add to this is a Grandpa who snorts heroin and regrets not sleeping with too many women in his youth. He is the one who is teaching dance to Olive for her talent completion.<br /><br />Real life married couple, Dayton and Faris do not muck around with an enticing script by putting distracting visual effects. So, the couple uses simplest of camera work and effects possible. Little Miss Sunshine is one of the most straightforwardly told movies, ever.<br /><br />Every role has been cast perfectly and it's hard to imagine any other actor in any of the roles. For this strange finally reaches California which is a perfect destination for a family that's trying improve themselves, the land of promise. But Little Miss Sunshine is not about the destination, but the journey. You'll be delighted from laughing and would want the ride to continue forever.

For some this might be an exaggeration, but having seen many movies, I feel confident in my assessment. I never get tired of this movie, even having seen this several times already and buying my own copy. All of the actors are great, and for a movie that was fairly low-budget and quickly-produced (I hear it took less than two months start to finish), it's easily better than many movies with a huge budget and huger special effects. The actors did a great job of embracing their roles. It's just one of these movies that was made to last - now that's quality.</p></body></html>

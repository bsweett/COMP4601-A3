As an analyst for CONTROL, the most classified of covert counter-espionage agencies, Max delivers intelligence reports that almost nobody ever reads.  Max dreams of the day when he can join his idols, Agents 23 (Dwayne Johnson) and 99 (Ann Hathaway), but his boss decides that Max is too important to waste him in the field.<br /><br />When CONTROL's seemingly secure headquarters is attacked from within, and its roster of worldwide agents is compromised, Max is hastily promoted to "Agent" and foisted on a reluctant Agent 99.  Their mission: find the base of the likely attackers, the implacable KAOS, and destroy it.  Led by the sinister Siegfried (Terence Stamp), KAOS's attack is likely the prelude to an even wider attack.  Lacking spy-smarts, and to 99's chagrin, Max finds his training sorely inadequate to the task.<br /><br />I don't want to say any more about the movie's plot, which could have fit snugly in an episode of the show.  That said, "Get Smart" is actually a lot of fun, seldom hilarious, "Get Smart" manages to be consistently funny and entertaining.  The smooth script deftly maneuvers between newer material and the original - never losing sight of what made the old show fun while also not being enslaved by it.<br /><br />The movie's strengths are its stars - impossible to overlook how this could have been another Hollywood retread of an old TV show, it's the performances that bring "Get Smart" over the top.  Alan Arkin is great as Chief, while Stamp deserves real props for managing to be funny (rather than pathetic) playing the most serious guy in a comedy.  Best of all are Steve Carrel and Hathaway.  Carrel creates a Max that is decidedly different from Don Adams (though he does channel Adams in one extended sequence set in a hidden KAOS weapons factory, possibly as a tribute, but also to remind you how far Carrel has gone his own way).  Hathaway is surprisingly effective as 99 (at times she even sounds like Barbara Feldon), playing as the sexy counterpoint to Max's undersexed virgin spy.  Never a laugh riot, "Get Smart" supplies a steady stream of funny lines, and you'll likely be chortling about "muffins of mass destruction" long after you forgot you caught this flick.</p></body></html>

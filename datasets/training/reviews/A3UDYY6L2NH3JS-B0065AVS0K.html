The black and white pictures are shockingly beautiful with subtle nuances in the greys and in the playing on light, or absence of light. The use of colors in that dark environment fascinates our eyes and mesmerizes our minds. The symbolic values of these colors are kind of simple though. Red as the color of blood or prostituted love is quite banal. Babylon is never very far away when red jumps into the picture. Yellow is funnier since it is the color of the arch-criminal, the senator's son. But yellow is also the color of fearful jaundice and of the cavalry, though the cavalry is not supposed to be afraid of anything and this barbaric torturer of a senator's son is not bouncing onto us to protect women and children, but rather to cut children into slices and transform women's heads into hunting trophies. The plot itself is sort of entangled : one plot in another and one crime in still another like so many russian dolls. Ir is fascinating to see all those super-heroes die and revive periodically. But the film is quite more pessimistic than Spiderman because there is no hope of an escape, no hope of a regeneration, no hope of an end to a neverending cycle of rotting and decaying because crime comes with power and power brings crime, since power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely, as is well-known. So do not forget to see that film if you do not want to die in ignorance.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></body></html>

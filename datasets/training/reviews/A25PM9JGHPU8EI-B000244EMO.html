It still has the same transfer as the previous edition which suffered - oh, what could have been! Aside from that, this classic has at last been given its due with a chock-full of supplements. It would have been off the f_____g charts if they'd managed to have Arnold and Jesse in for a commentary, but John McTiernan is good enough with a solid track full of details that I really enjoyed listening to. As far as the film itself, I swoon every time Ol'Painless has screen time, and the dialogue between all the cast is tight and fun chew over again and again. Tension throughout is amped and executed perfectly.</p></body></html>

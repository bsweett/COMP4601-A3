<meta name="summary" content="Heavy-duty Action with Mystical Overtones."></head><body><p>The third and final installment of "The Matrix" trilogy finds Neo (Keanu Reeves) in a coma, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) in possession of a human body, and Zion counting the hours to total annihilation at the hands of the machines. After some action-packed efforts on the part of Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), and Seraph (Collin Chou) bring Neo back to consciousness, all attention is turned to saving Zion from impending doom. Niobe (Jada Pinkett-Smith), Morpheus, and the remaining captain and crew set off in one ship in hopes of reaching Zion in time to help fight the onslaught of the machines. Neo and Trinity set off in another ship for the machine city, where Neo believes he will find humanity's salvation and the purpose of his existence. <p>If you are expecting "Revolutions" to make sense of the many bizarre plot elements that were introduced in "Reloaded", you will be disappointed. If you are expecting a sound resolution to the problematic relationship between humans and machines that we first learned of in "The Matrix", you won't get that either. Oddly, the fate of greater humanity, the humans living in the Matrix, has been abandoned entirely. <p>"Revolutions" is heavier on action than "Reloaded". -Literally heavy. This is a movie about heavy artillery. And it works better than "Reloaded" on that level. "Revolutions" suffers from the same mediocrity in cinematography, costumes, and music as "Reloaded" did. And I think the makeup is actually bad. We notice these things because the first movie excelled in these areas, as well as in many others. The film is sometimes bogged down by annoyingly verbose computer programs. (Why is it that whenever artificial life forms are featured in science fiction they have diarrhea of the mouth?) And the Wachowski Brothers  have now officially joined George Lucas and James Cameron as big budget action directors who can't write dialogue but insist on doing it anyway. The dialogue is insufferable. But I don't detect as much sloppy editing or plain poor judgment in "Revolutions" as there was in "Reloaded". And where "Reloaded" suffered from having no real villain, "Revolutions" has happily restored Agent Smith to nemesis status. Unfortunately, like its predecessor, "Revolutions" elicits laughs in all the wrong places. Once again, the fight sequences fall flat. But they are better integrated into the plot than they were in "Reloaded". (To see in a nutshell the vast difference in quality between this movie and the original, compare the gun battle at the entrance to the Frenchman's club to the lobby scene in "The Matrix". The latter was energetic and beautiful. "Revolutions" version is dismal, grotesque, and over-produced.) But  overall "Revolutions" is a slightly better film than "Reloaded" was. It is better constructed and, although all semblance of thoughtfulness has been abandoned, it works better as a straight action film than "Reloaded". The extended battle for Zion has some exciting moments, and I wasn't actually bored at any point during the film.<p>After seeing "Reloaded", I got the impression that "The Matrix" trilogy had been conceived in two parts, but the second part had been stretched into two movies with the addition of a lot of filler material. Having seen "Revolutions", I  still have this impression. But go see how the story ends. "The Matrix: Revolutions" is an entertaining shoot 'em up, but just isn't much beyond that.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Terminator is Finally Terminated."></head><body><p>Okay...bad choice for directors, this guy Jonathan Mostow (Beverly Hills Bodysnatchers, U-571) is not he kind of director for this kind of films. The film looked very broad and wide...but it had very little in it.<p>First off, my favorite is Terminator 2 - wonderful story and direction by James Cameron (Titanic, The Abyss). The Terminator is also very very good as well. And for its time, budget and limited technically resources for its time in the 80's - it's a very well put together film, story and performances.<p>Terminator 3 - lacks an interesting story and is not character based. Just one action and destruction sequence after another and another and another. The premise carries the story to its ultimate ending of the Macines getting their way in the future. An infinite loop of Terminators. Big Deal.h<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger (Gov of California, True Lies, Twins, Pumping Iron) tried to make good of his image but I am sure was drawn to the project for the money. The script he must have seen was week and the fact that James Cameron was not involved should have said to the producers...why?<p>The twist in this one is a metal morphing dripping changing female villain played by Kristanna Loken (Academy Boys, Panic) who is not that clever or interesting. Claire Daines (The Hours, Romeo &amp; Juliet) makes an honest effort to do something with her role...but everything is so uninteresting - she tries. Even the recasting of John Conner by Nick Stahl (Bully, Thin Red Line) should have been a clue.<p>The film lacks story, James Cameron, Linda Hamilton, Edward Furlong and isn't the same....sorry, but it really is not that interesting and they now have killed the franchise all togtehr. But the new Govenor will be busy with other things now. Good luck Govenor Schwarzenegger! (11-12-03)</p></body></html>

But if you do come across the quote, it completely cancels out the entire premise of what the film "Munich" is all about.  Not knowing much about the events of the Munich Olympic massacre, I wanted to see a drama that depicted the horrible tragedy and inform me of the reason it happened and what led up to it and thereafter.  It seems to me this movie made somewhat of a revenge spectacle of the tragedy.  The actors appeared "James Bond-esqe" and went about thier keystone cop theatrics with avengance.  Thier bloodlusting glory came easy with with no abandon and it made me feel like they were just as bad as the assasins that killed the Isreali athletes.  My oppinions are not to trivialize what happened.  I don't think the filmmakers intended to portray the "heroes" in this kind of light but the film ended up coming across like 007 meets Moses.  In my oppinion, I would have actors with a little more subtance and weight under thier belt.  Daniel Craig did not belong in this movie by the way.  He's not that great of an actor and I'm sure he did not resemble in the slightest what really happened, but then again what do I know?  NOT that great of a movie is what I know.</p></body></html>

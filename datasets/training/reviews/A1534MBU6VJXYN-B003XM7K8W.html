<meta name="summary" content="An Intellegent And Suspenseful Action Thriller"></head><body><p>Anyway who's expecting the usual Bruce Willish shoot - 'em - up action flick in "Hostage" is in for a big surprise. It's much more intelligent and original. It's without a doubt his finest presence onscreen since "The Whole Nine Yards".<br /><br />In the opening sequence, hostage negotiator Jeff Taley (Willis) is trying to stop a maniacal father from killing himself and his family. When Taley fails, it leaves a lasting emotional void on him and retires to a small community in California with his family (which includes Willis's real - life daugter Rumer as his daughter Amanda).<br /><br />Meanwhile, a trio of teenage punks decide to hijack a car owned by rich money launderer and family man Walter Smith (Kevin Pollak). The plan goes well until Smith's son trips the silent alarm and the cops arrive. The trio of boys take Pollak's family hostage and nearly kill Smith.<br /><br />Talley is brought back in to handle the situation. While on his way there, he learns that Pollak's character is a money launderer who left a secret code on a dvd. Talley is ordered to go into the Smith household and retrieve the dvd, or his family, who have been kidnapped by the men Smith works for, will be executed.<br /><br />This film is a great piece of cinema, but if you're not a big fan of violence, this film is not for you. It's as violent as all hell. Some of the film's most eyecatching parts include a 9 -year - old bleeding to death from a gunshot wound to the chin, a dog is decapitated by the terrorists who kidnap Talley's family, plus people getting shot, stabbed and lit on fire.<br /><br />Other than that, I think most people will truly enjoy this film. I'm also glad to see Bruce Willis finally being able to make good films after 5 years of flops.</p></body></html>

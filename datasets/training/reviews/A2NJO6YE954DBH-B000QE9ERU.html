<meta name="summary" content="It depends on whether you think this is the "real" Punisher"></head><body><p>I am not sure how ambivalent I am about this 2004 version of "The Punisher," but I found myself repeatedly thinking that the movie was taking two steps backwards for every step forward, so that by the end we were not ahead of the game. The original origin of the Punisher was that Frank Castle was out on a picnic with his family when they stumbled upon a mob hit and were gunned down. Frank survived, became the Punisher, and dedicated his life to making sure that those who avoid justice through the imperfections of the American legal system were made to pay for their crimes. This is a tradition that goes back to Batman and the Shadow, with the key difference that the Punisher has a lot of heavy weaponry. There are lots of comic book superheroes who have to deal with the onerous of being considered a vigilante, but the Punisher embraced the idea without ever worrying about being considered a hero.<br /><br />This time around Frank Castle (Thomas Jane) has much more of a hand in his tragic fate. He is an F.B.I. agent and the Fates conspire than on his last undercover job he kills one of the sons of gangster Howard Saint (John Travolta). Frank heads off to retirement and a family reunion in Puerto Rico while Saint orders his thugs to kill him. But then his wife (Laura Harring) ups the antes and tells them to kill his entire family. So that is what happens, as everyone of his relatives is gunned down in a prolonged massacre before his wife and son are dispatched in a poor imitation of the harrowing scene where the same thing happens to Mel Gibson in "Mad Max." Frank is shot point blank in the chest and just about set on fire, but none of this matters because he is going to come back from the "dead" and kill all of these people. That is what this movie is about.<br /><br />But the idea that you have this one guy who everybody thinks is dead come back and wipe out an entire criminal organization starts losing momentum when Frank blows the surprise element of being dead pretty quick. Meanwhile, not once but twice a single person just about takes him out and ends the movie before the final act. I always thought the Punisher's weak spot was that he was psychotic, not that he was relatively easy to surprise or beat up. He does come up with a nice little plan to stick it to Saint, but it is the sort of thing where you the realization of what has happened to sink into the guy before you put a couple of bullet holes in him and not afterwards. I also think that if you spend all your spare time turning a car into an armored tank that it should be good for more than one scene.<br /><br />The character who actually impressed me the most, surprisingly enough, was Spacker Dave (Ben Foster). He has one of the apartments in the dilapidated building Castle moves into to plan his punishment. Dave sticks his nose into the business of an abusive boyfriend pounding on the door of the lovely Joan (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) and is rescued by Castle, something nobody has ever done. So when Saint's right-hand man Quentin Glass (Will Patton) shows up looking for Castle and tortures Dave, using his various piercings against him, the guy does not break down and rat out Frank. It was an unexpected moment and has to do with the idea of Castle's new family (everybody in the building knows who Frank is and what he is doing), but still it had more gravity than anything else in the film.<br /><br />Jane worked himself in an appropriate state of buffness for this role, but is constrained by the script to mostly giving intense stares and making laconic comments in the Clint Eastwood tradition, while Travolta actually shows some restraint in mouthing his character's over the top lines. I missed the Dolph Lundgren in the 1989 film version adapted from the Marvel comics character, but my life has been full none the less and I suppose I should go check it out and see which of these two versions comes closest to capturing the essence of the comic book I remember, because based on what I saw in this film the title is still up for grabs.</p></body></html>

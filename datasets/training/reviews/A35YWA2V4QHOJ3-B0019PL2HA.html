This is a racing story Will Ferrell style, and I like it!!<br /><br />To be sure, this is the funniest movie I've seen in awhile.  I thought it would be hilarious from the theatrical previews & I was not disappointed.  According to other reviewers, they actually deleted a few key scenes from the theatrical release.  I never saw the original, but it sounds like that was a poor decision.  Typically, "uncut" means they ADDED a few scenes, not deleted them!<br /><br />The film would have gotten a 5 Star rating from me except for the fact that, unlike most unrated Will Ferrell flicks, this one omitted the obligatory gratuitous nudity.  This fact is a particular shame in this film as Leslie Bibb and Amy Adams are both SMOKIN' hot - AND they had plenty of opportunities for some tittilating sequences if they wanted to put them in.  Hence, those expecting some topless girls to be thrown into the uncut version (as was the case with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BKVQSE">Wedding Crashers - Uncorked (Unrated Full Screen Edition)</a> will be disappointed.  This is basically a PG-13 ditty with a few swear words added - that's it.<br /><br />While they didn't get the nudity part right, they did get the comedy part on the $$.  This is a movie that pokes fun at NASCAR as well as rednecks, which means that guys like me get a twofer!  I can't for the life of me see the appeal of watching cars going around in circles for 5hrs.  The makers of the movie tapped into the absurdity of the notion of marathon car races, as well as the silliness of having corporate sponsers tagged all over the race cars.  The sardonic wit of the movie's writers made this one quite cathartic for me!</p></body></html>

I'd heard of it, off and on, throughout the years, but never seen it until I had the joy of getting the Criterion Edition of the film, so I come to it as fairly recent first-time viewer.<br /><br />The movie's plot, as you know, centers around an American writer, Holly Martens, who goes to post-War Vienna to work for a friend named Harry Lime. When he gets there, he finds that Lime has met an untidy end, one that gets more and more untidy as Martens begins to pull at the loose threads of the story, until finally he finds a truth he never expected.<br /><br />As I said, I'd only recently seen the film for the first time, and I was very impressed by it! The acting was amazingly good as was the direction, and the plot was sensational! Kept me guessing all the way through (am I the only one who thought the balloon-man was a certain character in disguise? I bet not).<br /><br />The film is also filled with incredible moments. The aforementioned ballon-man. The appearance of Welles, which is probably the best reveal in movie history. The cukoo-clock speech. The chase through the sewers was VERY impressive and that alone makes the film worth watching!<br /><br />The movie was based on a story by Grahm Greene. I've never read any of his works, but this movie makes me want to. Likewise, while I've heard of Orson Welles and Joseph Cotton, and admired their performances in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX9E">Citizen Kane</a>, I'd never heard of Carol Reed until this movie. Apparently I now have some catching up to do.<br /><br />The extras on the DVD are all reasonably nifty. It IS a Criterion DVD, after all, and they seldom disapoint. The price tag might be a little steep, but who cares? It's one of the best movies ever made, and worth every penny.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="very impressive edge of the seat film!"></head><body><p>I was told that Vin Diesal would be the next big action film star, but I was unfamiliar with him until this film and I must say based on this, he will be around and making some excellent films.<p>This is basically a redo of Aliens, but boy what a good one!!  A spacecraft travelling along, is hit by space debris and causes the ship to crash land.  The Captain is killed leaving their female pilot, a bounty hunter and his prisoner and various other travellers on a planet with three suns.  The immediate danger is the need for water, so they strike out in search, but come upon an abandoned colony.  But no colonists.  They soon discover that 22 years ago, the people were attacked by creatures of the night, sort of a cross between a dragon and a bat that feed on human flesh.  The pilot contends with the struggle between the drug addict bounty hunter and his killer prisoner (Vin) and they all fight to survive first the desert planet, then the coming of the 22 year solar eclipse that sets the monsters of the dark loose.<p>It is taught, edge of the seat action, with great writing, direction and super acting from the whole cast.  <p>One very great Sci-FI film!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good but not a &quot;classic&quot;"></head><body><p>Wherein the special effects wizardry take center stage in this &quot;big bug&quot; tale, that alone does not come close to matching the greatness of true sci-fi films like &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still,&quot; &quot;The War of the Worlds,&quot; &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey,&quot; or even &quot;Planet of the Apes.&quot;  I really feel that the film deserves a &quot;3 1/2&quot; rating!<p>Casper Van Dien, Denise Richards, and the rest of the &quot;pretty&quot; cast have a few more roles to log under their belts before one can take them seriously as thespians.<p>For one into the technical aspects of Hollywood moviemaking, the film is a winner.  <p>For someone who wants an intriguing story about monster insects, stick with &quot;Them!&quot;</p></body></html>

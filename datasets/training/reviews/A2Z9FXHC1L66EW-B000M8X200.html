<meta name="summary" content="Still The Best Comic Book Adaptation To The Big Screen!"></head><body><p>Considering how hard it seems for directors, producers &amp; screenwriters to come up with a decent comic book screen adaptation, Richard Donner and company make it look so easy to do with Superman.  By far the best movie based on a comic book, Superman gives us a wonderful story that's both entertaining and heartwarming as it is loyal to the comic book purists who hate when Hollywood takes their favorite comic book heroes and turns them into something completely different.<p>Christopher Reeve was born to play this role, and to me (and millions of others out there) his Superman is the &quot;Definative Superman&quot; that all others will be judged by.  He's exactly how we perceive Superman to be: Logical, strong, sensitive, enduring, with a heart of gold and so on.  He is also the real reason to see the last two Superman movies.  You can say what you want about the movies themselves, but you can't say that he's not good in them, because he is.  I paticularly enjoyed the added scene in this film after he's saved Lois Lane from falling out of the helicopter (and other assorted tasks) and goes back to the fortress of solitude where he converses with his father (Marlon Brando) of how good it felt and that he couldn't help himself.  Jor-El (Brando) tells him not to be hard on himself, but to be mindful of his vanity, for it was vanity that destroyed the Kryptonians.  Finally, Jor-El tells his son how much he wishes he could hug him and Superman reaches his arms out to him as he disappears.  I really liked that.  He has never (and will never) be able to hug his Dad and there's a true feeling of saddness about this that rings true.  I can't believe scenes like this were cut from the original release, especially the &quot;Gauntlet&quot; sequence when Superman goes underground to hunt for Lex Luthor and gets hit by machine guns, masses amounts of fire, as well as cold freeze before finally reaching the entrance of the evil geniuses secret lair.  Never should've been cut!<p>I learned a lot from this DVD.  I was very shocked to learn that Alexander &amp; Ilya Salkind hired Richard Donner to direct Superman &amp; Superman II (as a two picture deal) and then fired him after the first film went on to become a huge success.  Apparantly it was due to creative differences, but I think they made a huge mistake when they fired him.  I'd go so far to say that Superman III &amp; IV would've been hits, had Donner went on to direct the enire series himself.  He would've looked at the script for part III and said, &quot;This is terrible!  Are you trying to destroy the franchise?!&quot;.  A special note to readers: Richard Donner did in fact direct scenes for Superman II, and had it not been for the fact that the original Superman had gone over budget causing part II to be delayed, he may have actually finished the whole thing himself.  What a pity that we'll never get to see what the Donner/Superman Saga would've been like.</p></body></html>

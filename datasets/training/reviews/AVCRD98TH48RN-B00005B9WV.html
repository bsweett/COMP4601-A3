<meta name="summary" content="Elegant Fantasy!!!"></head><body><p>With 10 Oscar nominations, that would certainly be enough to intrigue the average viewer, but it could be argued that this should have been the first film in history to win both Best Foreign Film and Best Picture.  Everyone I know who has seen this sparkling film and the film "Gladiator," which took home the Best Picture award, give a unanimous gasp at how that could have possibly happened.  The cinematography in this film is lush and just plain gorgeous!  The costumes are intricate and beautiful!  While the story is great fantasy laced with fantastic fight-choreography with many different weapons, not to mention hand-to-hand combat, and has an emotional depth not seen in most foreign films.  This is simply a great film!  Many are turned off by the "Peter Pan" fantasy elements of this extraodinary folk-tale, but I loved every moment, feeling like "if that's going to be possible in this movie, then anything could be."  What a delightful idea!</p></body></html>

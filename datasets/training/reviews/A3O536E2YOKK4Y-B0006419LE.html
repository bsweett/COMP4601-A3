<meta name="summary" content=""Don't look for it, Taylor, you might not like what you find.""></head><body><p>Since most people have seen the original 1968 "Planet of the Apes" (multiple times, I might add) this review is not so much intent on introducing the film to new viewers but rather provoking people to re-discover it, as I did recently.<br /><br />THE PLOT: George Taylor and two other astronauts experience some type of time warp in space and crashland on a distant planet over 2000 years in the future. They soon discover that highly evolved apes rule the planet while humans are disdained "animals."<br /><br />WHAT WORKS: First of all, Charlton Heston is outstanding as the disillusioned humanity-hating Taylor. Taylor is brilliantly put in the ironic position of representing humankind to the apes. Although I love Heston in other films like "Ben-Hur" and "The Ten Commandments," I believe Taylor is his best role and performance. Heston was, incidentally, 43 years old at the time of filming. He's utterly captivating in the role and charismatic in an anti-hero sense.<br /><br />The first 35 minutes of the film involve the crashland, the search over the wastelands, the discovery of primitive humans and, finally, the potent cornfield revelation of the intelligent rulers of the planet. This segment is one of my favorite parts of the film. The desert wastelands are awe-inspiring and one can't help but enjoy Taylor's amusingly pessimistic antics. This part of the film is highly mysterious in nature. Where ARE they? Why are there so few signs of life? Did Taylor hate humanity so much that he was literally willing to escape his home world? Who made the strange X-shaped scarecrows? Why can't the primitive "cavemen" speak? Who planted the crops of corn?<br /><br />When the story shifts to the ape city the film takes on an entirely different vibe. There's suddenly no more mystery and the shift is so jarring that the film momentarily loses its ultra-captivating sense of awe. But, no matter, the viewer is soon engulfed in the social dynamics of the ape society.<br /><br />The rough-hewn, alien-looking rock city sets are marvelous and the ape make-up is exceptional considering the time period. In fact, it holds up pretty well even to this day.<br /><br />It is soon discovered that the apes have three distinct "races": The chimps are scientific, humanitarian and pacifistic; the gorillas are militaristic; and the orangutangs are the respected elders & religious leaders. The attention to detail of the ape society, and the social dynamics thereof, is nothing less than brilliant. The apes have their own distinctive walk and the actors do a spendid job depicting facial expressions through all that make-up, giving life to their characters.<br /><br />The story's characters are distinctly fleshed-out and superbly performed by all involved: Nova, the animal-like cavegirl, played by the beautiful Linda Harrison. Zira (Kim Hunter) and Cornelius (Roddy McDowall), who are willing to risk everything for the sake of the truth and their ideals. Dr. Zaius (Maurice Evens), the defender of the apes' religious faith and protector of their society. Heck, even the secondary characters are great, like the chimp teenager Lucius and the gorilla jailguard Julius.<br /><br />Although Dr. Zaius is portrayed as sort of a villain or antagonist, it's impossible to hate him. One ascertains that he only acts in the best interest of the apes. He's very learned and, although he doesn't know or believe everything about Taylor and humankind in general, he does know that humans were once the dominant species of the planet, ages ago, but they foolishly destroyed themselves and their great society. He knows very well that the apes have this same destructive potential so he does everything in his power to protect the community he knows and loves. Note how Cornelius and Zira regard Zaius with the utmost reverence and respect at all times, even when they are fugitives and Taylor has Zaius captive. This shows their humility and respectfulness. Also notice that, at the very end, right before Taylor and Nova depart down the shoreline on the horse, Zaius suddenly has it in his power (by way of the returning gorillas on horseback) to stop and even kill Taylor, but he DOESN'T. He lets them go. Why? I believe this reveals his good character and shows that he's not a villain at all. He knew Taylor could have easily killed him numerous times when he had the upper hand, so he mercifully returns the favor -- to an "animal" no less!<br /><br />Also, consider this: Although Zaius is shown in a negative light by hindering scientific efforts to discover historical truth, the Lawgiver's scriptures that he quotes from are RIGHT -- humans ARE destructive & made a desert of parts of the planet and, for the sake of ape society, should not be allowed to "breed in great numbers." Zaius obviously feels that the apes, in general, can't handle the truth. ("You can't HANDLE the truth!!")<br /><br />The climax is incredible: Taylor and Nova travel a LONG distance down the shoreline while the viewer hears eerie music on the soundtrack. Something's just not right; it's too quiet and uneventful. There's no way it's gonna end like this. And then, suddenly, the truth about the "planet of the apes" is revealed. Utterly dumbfounded, Taylor jumps off his horse and furiously pounds his fists into the surf while screaming out curses at humanity.<br /><br />Lastly, the score by Jerry Goldsmith is PERFECT -- fittingly eerie and primal.<br /><br />WHAT DOESN'T WORK: Sometimes the apes' mouths don't move enough when they speak and it clearly looks artificial. Also, there are a few corny elements of dialogue and the social commentary is occasionally tacky. I suppose the above "jarring shift" could also be viewed as a negative point.<br /><br />FINAL ANALYSIS: I've seen "Planet of the Apes" numerous times over the years and previously saw it just two years ago. You would think that I'd "know it all" and nothing would surprise me, move me, teach me, etc. Yet, after just viewing it again, I am reminded of why this is such a great science-fiction film, even though it's forty years old. Some things I re-discovered but others I "saw" and experiecnced for the first time! Who woulda thought? I should also point out that "Planet of the Apes" is very adult-oriented (even though kids will, of course, appreciate many aspects of it). Although there is quite a bit of action, it is by no means an action flick. It's primarily a dialogue-driven sci-fi adventure. So those who need constant explosions to maintain their juvenile attention should steer clear (not that there's anything wrong with that -- heh, heh).<br /><br />Lastly, this film and its sequel "Beneath the Planet of the Apes" (which is technically the only sequel in the series; the others are prequels) should be viewed as ONE long film/story. "Beneath" suffers from budget cuts, etc. but it is, in its own unique way, almost as good as "Planet."</p></body></html>

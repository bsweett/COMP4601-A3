<meta name="summary" content="THE BEST MOB MOVIE EVER ****"></head><body><p>The argument for the best mob movie ever can made endlessly.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXAA">The Godfather DVD Collection</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GGSMB2">Scarface (Platinum Edition)</a>, Goodfellas, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000C20VPA">Casino</a>, even <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008RH3L">Miller's Crossing</a> gets mentions.  But Goodfellas is my favorite movie and the best ever to accurately depict the mob at it's best.<br /><br />This is the tale of a rise to power for one man and it all being snatched away from him.  One of the best movies of all time.<br /><br />Included are some nice Special Features.<br /><br />Two commentary tracks:<br />- Martin Scorsese,Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Thelma Schoonmaker, etc.<br />- Henry Hill and the agent that arrested him/<br /><br />Four Feauterettes.<br />Theatrical Trailer.<br /><br />Pick this up.  You won't be disappointed.</p></body></html>

I found it to be very interesting and thoroughly engrossing. Lawrence Tierney seems like the most dangerous man alive and Michael Madsen the most dementedly evil. I don't know who is worse. The cast and their performances are unparalleled. Steve Buscemi is quite a character in his own right. This is a real nail bitter. Great character studies hold your interest throughout despite the implied graphic violence.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="CONFLICT OF EMOTIONS; EXCELLENT FILM, EGOTISTICAL SUBJECT"></head><body><p>Treadwell was a lost soul in search of a cause; at one point he wanted to be an actor but lost a starring role in a hit TV series (although later got his 15 minutes on the David Letterman Show which includes an offhand remark by Letterman about Treadwell being killed by a Grizzly...) and decided to become a hermit and a Saviour of Ursus Terribilis. He is an entertaining subject by virtue of his manic on-camera antics and his apparent fascination for the Big Bad Grizzly Bears. His penchant for giving them names and imbuing them with little personalities and cartoon-like foibles is a bit too saccharine and elicits some squirms.<br /><br />These are not Disney cartoon characters, nor were they happy to have this hyperactive human living among them. The bears were fine before Treadwell declared himself their rescuer and defender and are fine now...no bears were being poached nor were they in the dangers Treadwell intimates.<br /><br />He has one scene which is probably closest to his true persona where he has a meltdown on camera and just goes off on an enraged, over-dramatic speech and we see how truly disturbed this guy is.<br /><br />He did believe he was literally saving these beasts, and he did get some great footage of them, but his own self-indulgent drama overwhelmed any potential benefits of these efforts.<br /><br />The only sympathetic figure in this story is Amie who stayed with Treadwell despite her own well-founded fears, and interestingly, she had a far more pragmatic and accurate POV of these bears than he did.<br /><br />Treadwell never did well when interacting with people in general, and on their way home after their last summer in Grizzly Maze, he and Amie were at the airport when he had a run-in with "an obese" airline employee which was enough to send the uber-sensitive self-described naturalist scurrying back to the bears, much later in the season than was wise.<br /><br />At the end of the film we see Treadwell's parents, his mother holding his favorite childhood toy...a stuffed bear, the two of them sitting at their Florida home, looking bewildered at their son's final outcome and how it all came about. That moment is really sad.<br /><br />Herzog made in impressive film about all this self-indulgent drama and really cared about his reckless star, being moved to tears listening to the audio recording of their last few minutes. It is horrifying to realize just how terribly Treadwell and Amie suffered, physically and emotionally, and how utterly unnecessary it all was and how easily it could have been prevented. Amie, of course, had the worst role of watching her lover being literally devoured by this rogue bear and being helpless to stop it.<br /><br />The Greek Chorus of women who may or may not have been intimate with Treadwell are depressing, and their girlish, coy hints at a physical relationship are grotesque. One wonders; would they have been so devoted to Treadwell if he had been less attractive?<br /><br />But kittenish females aside, the documentary is gripping and holds you rapt throughout; it is Herzog who turns Treadwell's footage into gold and makes it unforgettable.</p></body></html>

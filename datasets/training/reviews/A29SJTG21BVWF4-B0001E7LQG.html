<meta name="summary" content="Shining stars"></head><body><p>In this story we find an older gentleman(Jack) who is dating a younger woman(Peet) and they go up to meet her mother(keaton).  Jack then goes onto have a heart attack and is hospitalized.  He then must stay at keaton's house until he is all better.  During this time we see loving blooming between Keaton and Jack.  And how the emotional rollercoaster is pushed into high gear by the end of the movie.<br /><br />  Jack and Keaton do an excellent job of acting in this movie.  Which makes it even better of a movie(as if these two actors couldn't of done that on their own).  A cute story about love is just right for almost any situation.</p></body></html>

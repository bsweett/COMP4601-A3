<meta name="summary" content="The Ultimate Edition of the Ultimate Zombie Classic!"></head><body><p>Picking up after the events of "Night of the Living Dead," in which unknown forces caused the bodies of the recently deceased to return to life in search of live, human prey, "Dawn of the Dead" instantly slams us into a world crumbling in confusion, panic, and desperate violence. As people break their ties and scatter to survive, one band of four, a helicopter pilot, his pregnant girlfriend, and two swat team members, take refuge in a shopping mall surrounded by the flesh-eating dead. Perhaps they can take control of the already infested mall, but what then?<br /><br />In 1968, George A. Romero shocked the world with his apocalyptic vision, "Night of the Living Dead." The black and white, low-budget film became a phenomenon that spawned remakes, countless copycats, and 3 excellent sequels, the first of which came eleven years later. That first sequel was "Dawn of the Dead," and it would seem that most zombie fans consider it to be the best film of its kind. Loaded with satire and comic-book violence, some, Romero himself for example, do not even consider it a true "horror" film. Its extreme action and over-the-top look and style make it far more fun than scary to many, but I'd count myself among those who feel that there are definitely some genuinely horrific moments and themes throughout. But, whether you're watching it for fun or fright, this is a movie that is more than it seems, and the original "Dawn of the Dead" definitely deserves a place among the greatest films ever made. If you're a zombie fan, you know this is a must own. If you're not, and especially if you haven't even experienced the genre, make sure you give this one a look before committing yourself against it. Be prepared for some wild and gory stuff, yes, but try to look beyond it as well.<br /><br />Dawn was followed in 1985 by a sequel that is good as part of the series, but far less enjoyable (in my opinion), "Day of the Dead." Day was followed by the most recent sequel, "Land of the Dead," in 2005. Land was an excellent installment in the series. One year before that, a remake of Dawn was released without the involvement of Romero. It's an excellent film in its own right, but definitely tailored to modern sensibilities. All action and very little substance, and I'm not a fan of its fast-moving, purely disease-infected zombies. With the new wave of zombie and zombie-like films that have been coming out recently, the original "Dawn of the Dead" has yet to be topped. Though, I have to give special points to "Shaun of the Dead." It comes highly recommended as well.<br /><br />There is truly no better way to own "Dawn of the Dead" than in the 4-disc "Ultimate Edition" from Anchor Bay. You get three beautiful, widescreen versions of the film, each on its own disc with a different commentary track and extras, and a disc full of documentaries as well. Disc One is Romero's true cut, the U.S. Theatrical version, along with a great commentary by Director George Romero, the legendary make-up/effects man Tom Savini, and Assistant Director Chris Romero (George's wife). Also on Disc One are TV Spots and Theatrical Trailers, Radio Spots, a Poster and Advertising Gallery, a George Romero bio, and a comic book preview. Disc Two offers up the Extended Version. This is coupled with an audio commentary by Producer Richard P. Rubinstein. Most interesting is the very dated Monroeville Mall commercial which is also included along with a Behind-the-Scenes photo gallery, a memorabilia gallery, and production stills. Disc Three presents the European Version of the film. This is a more straightforward horror cut of the film from the hands of Dario Argento. Disc Three also includes one of those always fun cast commentaries, and we are lucky enough to get all four of the brilliant lead actors together here for this one! We also get a Dario Argento bio, a home video and soundtrack art gallery, an international poster and advertising gallery, an international pressbook gallery, U.K. TV Spots, international theatrical trailers, and an international lobby card gallery. Disc Four is where the documentaries are at, and here we are treated to: The Dead Will Walk, a great new documentary including interviews with just about everyone you'd hope to hear from; Roy Frumkes' Documentary of the Dead, a fascinating documentary actually filmed during the making of the film; On-Set Home Movies from a most appreciated zombie extra, Robert Langer; And a great tour of the Monroeville Mall with one of the stars, Ken Foree. There's also a bizarre little Easter Egg on the disc. At least, I think it was on Disc Four. After watching so much material on 4 different discs, it can be hard to keep track!<br /><br />The DVD set comes in sturdy, fold-open cardboard packaging with a slip case, DVD guide with mall map, and a neat little comic book teaser that illustrates the first part of the film (ending right when they arrive at the mall). It's a fantastic collection and a must own for any true fan!</p></body></html>

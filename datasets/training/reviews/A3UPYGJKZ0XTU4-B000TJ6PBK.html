<meta name="summary" content=""It's an evil f**king room." -Gerald Olin, Manager, Dolphin Hotel"></head><body><p>Based on Stephen King's short horror story, "1408" keeps us guessing whether the horror lives in the room or in the mind of its aggrieved, alcoholic protagonist. Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is a novelist whose creative energies have seen better days. Now he churns out guidebooks to purportedly haunted locales and tours the country in search of paranormal activity that he never finds. Mike wants to investigate Room 1408 in New York's Dolphin Hotel. But the hotel's manager Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson) does everything he can to dissuade Mike from entering the room, where 56 guests have died in the hotel's 95-year history. Mike scoffs at the claim that no one lasts more than an hour, and insists on spending the night in Room 1408.<br /><br />We spend that hour with Mike in real time. The build-up to the hour of horrors introduces us to Mike's state of mind, to the legend of Room 1408, and to the imposing, intriguing hotel manager Olin. Mike's conversation with Olin is a lot of fun before we enter the maelstrom. The action in the Room runs out of steam after a while, but it recovers and succeeds largely because we're never quite sure what the source of Mike's ordeal is. At times, I thought "1408" was no more than a minor reworking of "The Shining", but the film doesn't linger long on any one rationalization. I can't say that I was scared, but I was entertained by Mike's cynicism, Olin's frankness, and that Room that forces its occupants to confront -and perish by- their own demons.<br /><br />The DVD (Weinstein Company single disc 2007): The single disc DVD contains the theatrical release version of the film, not the director's cut. Bonus features are 2 "webisodes", which are brief promo spots, and a theatrical trailer. In "John Cusack on 1408: A Webisode" (2 ? min), Cusack talks a little about the story and Samuel L. Jackson talks about the room. "Inside Room 1408: A Webisode" (2 min) features actors commenting on the room, and the special effects supervisor explains some of the effects. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH and Spanish. Dubbing available in French.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Fox & co fight the the terrorists in HD"></head><body><p>It's too bad that this fine action/themed film did not get it's due at the box office.  Well directed by actor Peter Berg who also does a small cameo in this flick, the cast is well served by Oscar winners Jamie Fox & Chris Cooper, Jennifer Garner (Alias) and Jason Bateman as FBI agents sent to the Middle East to investigate a bombing which took the lives of civilians, American and Arabs, alike by a terrorist group. The tension is high throughout and the transfer to HD is excellent.  Fox more than makes up for his previous bummer, "Stealth", with this winner.</p></body></html>

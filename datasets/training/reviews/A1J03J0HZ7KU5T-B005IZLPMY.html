Director Joe Johnston doesn't let CGI overwhelm this engaging World War II comic-book adventure. Chris Evans delivers a sincere performance in the title role - well-matched by Tommy Lee Jones, Hayley Atwell, Stanley Tucci (doing his best Maximilian Schell imitation) and a memorably villainous Hugo Weaving as the Red Skull. The Marvel superhero finally receives the A-list production he richly deserves.</p></body></html>

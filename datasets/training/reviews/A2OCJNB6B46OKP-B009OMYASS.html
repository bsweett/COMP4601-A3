<meta name="summary" content="If Quinten Liked It Who Wouldn't?"></head><body><p>I saw the trailer for this movie around haloween and while watching I was trying to figure out who in the holy of holies would want to make this movie? When one of the most brilliant film makers name came up at the very end I scratched every previous thought and wanted to see it immeditly.<br /><br />'Hostel' is a fantastic film weather you want to beleive it or not. Even though there are moments that you really wish you didn't have to see the audience is given characters that are developed so perfectly in such a short amount of time that you actually have feelings for the good guys and want the bad guys to be punished. Beleive me you get nothing but a great movie with Hostel.<br /><br />I can understand why Quinten Tarentino chose to work on this movie. There is a very big Tarentino vibe throughout this movie. There is gore blended with quirky action and plenty of humor throughout. Don't even think about the grusome scenes from what I saw no one else in my theater did.</p></body></html>

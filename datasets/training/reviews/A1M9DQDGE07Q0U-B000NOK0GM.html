Unfortunately, this edition of the film suffers from extreme grain, digital and film, shimmering details and a rough appearance that still makes for a gritty viewing experience despite considerable restoration efforts.  Orson Welles is Harry Lime, a con artist who's black market insulin sales have either killed or crippled hundreds. Joseph Cotten is Lime's best friend and totally unaware of the scam.  The film is one of the post war cinemas greatest acheivements.  Unfortunately, it needs a more pristine transfer than this to make it worth the while and price that Criterion is asking.</p></body></html>

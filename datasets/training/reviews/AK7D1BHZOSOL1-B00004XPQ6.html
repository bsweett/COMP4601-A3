Out of all the planters on the Santee Mel is the only owner that has freed slaves <p>B.  By the end of the film Ben's kids are their own cousins <p>C.  The battle of Cowpens was a minor affair and nowhere near as grand as it was protrayed if they were going to try to reinact a battle it should have been the Battle of Kings Moutain.  <p>Now let me say that it isn't a wast of time if you just want to have fun, but it isn't history.  I beg you to remember that this movie is not history when you are watching it.</p></body></html>

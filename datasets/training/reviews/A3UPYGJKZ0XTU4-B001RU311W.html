Harvey Milk (Sean Penn) sporadically narrates the film through a recording which was to be played in the event of his death. He begins with the day he picked up Scott Smith (James Franco) on a New York subway platform. The men became lovers and moved to San Francisco, where they became hippies and opened a camera shop in the Castro district. Milk's successful efforts to mobilize the gay community into an economic and political force didn't translate into successful runs for public office -until redistricting and a new campaign manager gave him a better shot.<br /><br />Harvey Milk was the first openly gay man to hold public office in the United States (there was one lesbian who preceded him). His political activism in San Francisco came at a time of violent clashes between police and gay citizens, who could genuinely claim that they were being persecuted and feared for their physical safety. It was also a time of social upheaval and political unrest due, in part, to the stagnant economy of the 1970s. A man could grow a ponytail in middle age, stand on a box on a street corner, and try to make a cohesive community out of a diffuse group of people who normally preferred to hide their identities. Harvey Milk created the "gay community", and his charisma and tireless activism turned them into a political force that spearheaded the campaign against California's Briggs Initiative.<br /><br />Other powerful gays in San Francisco presented themselves as ordinary citizens who happened to be gay, with the idea that that was a more inclusive image and smarter politics. Milk was more hot-headed and had a feel for the times. He would make the gay community a self-identified socio-political faction. Of course, there is the possibility that emphasizing their differences instead of their commonality with the average San Franciscan would ultimately be alienating. It makes me wonder how Milk, who openly approved of the pick-up culture, would have coped with the AIDS crisis had he lived to see it. Harvey Milk had his own way of doing politics, which "Milk" presents as heroic. That's not indisputable, but it was certainly effective, and Sean Penn's performance really conveys Milk's passion and charm.<br /><br />The DVD (Universal 2009): Bonus features are 3 featurettes and some deleted scenes. "Remembering Harvey" (13 min) interviews people who knew Milk, many of whom are represented in the film, about their memory of him, his death, and his legacy. In "Hollywood Comes to San Francisco" (14 min), the screenwriter, producers, and cast talk about making the movie and their characters. "Marching for Equality" (8 min) interviews Cleve Jones and others who participated in several real marches in San Francisco that were recreated for the film. Subtitles for the film are available in English SDH, Spanish, and French. Dubbing available in French.</p></body></html>

I wouldn't agree actually, not because I don't like it but because I have other personal best. But anyway whatever other Argento's film is your favourite, you'll have to admit "Suspiria" is a tremendous achievement on all levels.<br /><br />As Argento says himself many directors use their dreams for their story-lines and for the visual expression of their movies. And Dario admits he uses his nightmares for this purpose. I never had a chance to get into Argento's head and see what nightmares he's having, but they are definately very morbid and at the same time extremely picturesque. Although his films have obvious plots which are quite realistic, Argento manages to wind some surreal and dreamy details into them. And it makes his works truly an unforgetable experience. I won't concentrate on "Suspiria" plot-line, because everyone who wanted already knows what it's about. But as in most of Argento's movies here it's "how" that's more important, not "what".<br /><br />The whole ballet-school in "Suspiria" looks so surreal though pretty realistic. The setting reminds of old German expressionist features like "Cabinet of Doctor Caligari", only in color. All those colorful and twisted interiors look improbable yet still realistic. If you look close enough you'll notice the door knobs are placed rather high giving an impression that school-girls, who look about 18-19 y.o. in reality, are ten years younger. This antinomy invokes strange feelings, and in a documentary dedicated to the film Argento reveals couple of other secrets about creating his atmosphere of unease and irreality. Acting and music add a lot to it, I think Goblin's mesmerizing soundtrack for "Suspiria" is one of the most memorable in movie history. Even if you are not a horror-film aficionado, you're going to like "Suspiria" because it's a real piece of art, taking any aspect of cinematography. And if you are a fan of horror and Dario Argento in particular, I'd like to say "Suspiria" Anchor Bay 3-disc limited edition is your best choice. It has explicit "Suspiria 25th anniversary" documentary, trailers, posters and still gallery, cast and crew filmographies and biographies, 32-page color booklet, and what's important - CD containing Goblin's OST for "Suspiria". This edition is now OOP, but I'm sure you'll find a way to get it if you really need it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Great Movie About Living In The Moment"></head><body><p>I had heard nothing but good things about "Friday Night Lights" before going to see the film for myself.  As a teenager, I attended a school with a similiar love of football, so this movie really hit home for me.  "Friday Night Lights" manages to take the viewer into the action better than most football movies to date.<br /><br />The movie starts off a little fuzzy, adding the documentary type effect, but after a third of the movie has passed, it takes on a more professional Hollywood big film feel.<br /><br />The acting is good.  The storyline is not only true but works well on the big screen.  Billy Bob Thorton, besides having been married to the most beautiful woman in the world, is a also a great actor.  He does a great job not over-acting in this film.  Many actors would have not have been able to pull this role off.  But Billy Bob makes the true-life character Coach Gary Gaines come across quite well.<br /><br />The on-the-field scenes are very realistic, and the movie manages to throw in "touching" moments and a few "funny" parts.  All of the young actors did a great job of making the situations seem believable and also managed to not over-act their parts.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie top any football fan.  It delivers the goods.<br /><br />For parents...their are a few sexually explicit scenes, so use discretion.  Send little ones for popcorn when the scene starts to get a little heavy.<br /><br />See ya next review</p></body></html>

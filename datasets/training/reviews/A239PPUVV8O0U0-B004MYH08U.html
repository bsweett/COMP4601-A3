Sure I may not like the Twilight films, but I don't outright hate them as they make me laugh on several occasions coupled with the fact that the third film was OK. But this? If I could rate it any lower, I would! I actually even tried to give it the benefit of the doubt. The only thing I ever saw the Green Hornet was the two-part crossover featured in the original Batman series and since then have wanted to see the original series. Then I first heard about this garbage 2-3 years ago and found out Seth Rogen was writing and starring in it. At first I wondered who Seth Rogen is and then once I found out what kind of films he was in, I was like "Well people were upset when Michael Keaton was cast as Batman and look how that turned out." Boy was I wrong! He's an unfunny, talentless person (remember this is all opinion as I'm sure others have found him funny in other projects) but he should've stayed away from this! When I saw this in theatres, at first my dad and I were the only two in there but then at least five to ten more people showed up. Those other people found it hilarious. I sat there in silence, hoping it would get better. Rogen portrays the Hornet as a half-wit and screams with joy during one of their escapes as the police cars crash into obstacles. Britt Reid may want the Green Hornet to appear as a criminal but at no point, at least from the original series, does he get excited at the thought of mayhem and destruction. The guy who plays Kato, the name escapes me at the moment, was OK he didn't leave much of an impact on me (though that strange way he fights or gets pumped during a fight I thought was unnecessary and "out there") Cameron Diaz (another person I don't personally enjoy but she's OK) was wasted in this. The villain was bland, along with his recurring "joke" and the reveal of the DA being corrupt was expected. Black Beauty though was the highlight and I wish it was the Green Hornet who got totalled in the end and not the car. Believe me I wanted to like this but it was just stupid and I hope there is not a sequel. Another thing I noticed is a parallel with Batman; in the '60s, Batman was played as farce while the Green Hornet was played straight with Batman being far more successful. Nowadays, Batman is the serious one and Green Hornet played for laughs, again with the Caped Crusader far more successful. If you want to get into the Green Hornet my suggestion is to find the radio series or the much better Van Williams/Bruce Lee TV series (along with his crossover on Batman). And what really astounds me is that THIS has made more money than Green Lantern (just to clarify, Ryan Reynolds wasn't my first choice either and I actually thought they'd go with the John Stewart character for obvious reasons but he was good).</p></body></html>

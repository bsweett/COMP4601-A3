<meta name="summary" content="You dare destory a childhood memory TIM? Why Burton, Why?!??!"></head><body><p>For all my reviews visit my website<br /><br />I am NOT reviewing the DVD. Just the movies unless otherwise stated.<br /><br />Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.<br /><br />Ah, whatever your thinking, IS WRONG!!!! Unless it is that the theory of relativity is false...Okay, there's been a weird trend, the return of good kids movies. Where the Wild Things Are, to A Christmas Carol, The Princess and the Frog, and they're making a new video game called "Epic Mickey" (Although those who are 8 will have nightmares playing this game.) I expected this to be among the war against crap. I...was flipping wrong! This is the equivalent to Hollywood BullCrap<br /><br />What does it start out as? Well, it actually starts out pretty good, I like the first scene with Alice as a 6 year old very much, it was very well done. The next scene, was alright, a little unnecessary and not exactly for those who are 5 to talk about *cough*Alice is forced to marry a crapper*cough* Yeah, I meant to say that. Here's the good part about that scene though: three of the characters in that scene (and I controversially recognize a fourth) are in the same portray as characters later featured in Underland or... *cough*IT'S WONDERLAND YOU IDIOTS!*cough*I do not care if the book said it or not, and no I have not read the book.  So, here's where the good transition happens. The rabbit appears, and Alice wants to chase it. Awesome, Alice does chase it, and falls down a rabbit hole in a tree, Awesome! Then, she drinks a potion and turns small! Awesome! Eats a cake and makes her big! Awesome! Then, the crappiest voices for the characters and the worst plot of all time...Oh Heck No!<br /><br />So this is where we enter Wonderland. Wow, they really took a weird adaptation to Wonderland's scenery, I thought they should have kept a itsy bitsy closer to the dark realms that were featured in the Disney version, it was produced by Disney Pictures right? Right? But, it's okay, not the worst part of this movie. Ugh, I hate Tweedle Dee and Dum, they are completely and utterly stereotyped, where as in the original (as I recall) were a little more character like. The Rabbit, why does he co-operate with Alice? Why not just run away? I understand SOME changes have to be made, but even if they're going for a sequel, it should be the same idea every time. Like, in almost all Godzilla movies (minus 2) Godzilla is fighting another monster. I understand if they don't have him fight a monster, but what if he tagged up with a monster and didn't fight one? It would be immature at the best.<br /><br />Who's this mouse? A character from the book? I can respect that, but she is way to corny. Infact, they're all corny except for the Dodo bird, and he's gone in a jiffy and doesn't talk...AND THAT'S WHY HE'S NOT CORNY! Well, all the introduction characters are corny. The Chesier cat (is that how you spell it?) Is pretty cool, I don't think he has the same charm, but he's alright. He had the best line that SO should have been the purple cat's line...I can imagine Pooh and Kah saying that "I don't get involved...in...politics." PERFECTION! So, they're talking about this Jabberwocky (Jabberwocky woo woo woo) (You will understand my most embarrassing moment near the end of this review) and, I like the Jabberwocky in other adaptations, but I decided early that I didn't like it because......He only shows up in the final battle and does not speak more than 10 words! WHY ABUSE CHRISTPOPHER LEE AKA COUNT DOOKU AKA COUNT DRACULA LIKE THIS!!!!!!<br /><br />So, then comes this gigantic rabid white cat...Umm...God, I should have watched the 1951 yesterday, I don't think I remember him but he seems familiar. Anyway, he starts beating people up and capturing them for the "Red Queen" (who's opposite is "The White Queen." I understand this book was written before MLK, but please, you don't haft to keep to the book to details and not retain the entire plot of the 1951 movie, it should be reversed.) Not to mention, she is called The Queen of Hearts in the original book, but Red Queen in the sequel. So, this is a sequel but...You catch my drift. I guess I realized this was gonna be pretty corny from there on, so I can't remember too much.<br /><br />Oh, but you will hear me rant about this holly crap. Johnny Depp. Now, I know what your thinking "overacting, we understand you Ca$hman." NO! He underacts! What the heck! I'd rather have overacting than underacting!!! OIY SCHABATSCHE! And, he isn't even the same size as the hare! Oh, BTW, that hare isn't psychotic like in the original, but more like a wound up old senior citizen with a bad case of "post-WWE-career" syndrome. (P.S. I love WWE and TNA for that matter.)  But, come on! THE HATTER IS SUPPOSED TO BE PSYCHOTIC! I like that the cat and the hatter and hare...and the mouse, all sat down for tea, but it wasn't carried in the way I would have appreciated. And, they all react to her like some hero, was she a hero in the original? I remember her being harassed by everyone in Wonderland.<br /><br />The Red Queen...okay...I understand you should have made her skinny because people are more sensitive to biases, and Walt wasn't the best about being Politically Correct but...Did they haft to paint her face white??!!! That's even worse! At least it is natural to be fat (yes...it is...) but it is not natural to have your entire face painted white! I understand, maybe some painting of face paint...but this is ridiculous. And, boy, they made the White Queen all human, but The Red Queen inhumane. Or inhuman? Whoops. But seriously, inhumane, she orders a frog to have his head chopped off for drinking wine out of the royal glass or something, and then has a pig be her foot stool while she sits in her throne. BTW, she doesn't even say "OFF WITH HER HEAD!!!" Right! She did in the trailer!!!! What the heck!!! And can't we have a similar voice instead of this...well...it goes well with the attire and body type. The White Queen feels like someone from Final Fantasy or Kingdom Hearts...nuff said.<br /><br />The servant of the queen is kinda cool, but I feel bad for him having to be trapped with this slave driver. She acts cool to him, but to have to see this torture in front of him...ugh. And, she isn't exactly good looking. I swear, (and she is 19 in this movie) the only remotely attractive person in this movie was Alice, and that's not cool! You make what we think is an innocent kid look attractive? Then put back our heads on with a Wikipedia page that LONGER THAN ANY OSCAR WINNING MOVIE?!?!?!?!!??!!?!?!?! Oh, and they also include the flowers, but for barely any time at all. That's another thing they miss, they keep introducing characters throughout the original but just stay with a certain group in this one. I mean, after we get introduced to the White Queen there's really nobody else introduced.<br /><br />Wait! Another guy I forgot about because he was barely included. The Blue Caterpillar, I know he's called something else but I just like The Caterpillar.  He smokes, but in the original he just gives Alice trouble, instead here, we actually get what we expect, words of wisdom. It be cool if the original wasn't such a donkey, which I miss. Well, here we go, the Jabberwockey (that is how you spell it correct?) As I said, he talks no more than ten words, you wanna know why? Because that jerk Alice (actually, I really think she's cool in this movie, but I still like the original better) cut off his tongue! I know your trying to kill him but...Hey, Tim Burton, there's a lot of things wrong with your mother, can I tell you?<br /><br />The epic clash is not so epic, she talks through the hole thing with no Christopher Lee, which bugs me. She cuts off his head, I would expect at least a little blood. It kinda felt like they were going video game style. But, I didn't get to play as Alice during the final chapter because IT'S A MOVIE!<br /><br />Now, here's where "Jabberwockey, Jabberwockey, woo woo woo" makes sense. After the jabberwockey is defeated and the White Queen is queen again, Red Queen almost gets killed by the servant yadda yadda yadda, The Hatter (AKA not Johnny Depp in this scene) does a disco dance off! No lyrics, you may as well insert my lyrics, it's just THAT CORNY! I think of the Rick Roll<br />every time I see this.<br /><br />I like the ending, Alice showing a little attitude. Again, I liked Alice in this movie.  Okay, there was one last scene that was very corny after that, but I'm considering that the official ending.<br /><br />Well, I've written a ton of paragraphs about a movie that I don't like (EPIC FAIL) and I guess I'll give it a summary. Somebody took Tim Burton, Walt Disney, Martin Luther King Jr. and Harry Potter in a blender with a rotten pickle, and forced it down a 5 year old's face! This tried to be all four great flavors, and it wound up being really bad. It had great intentions, like I said I thought it was going to be great, but it was bad.<br /><br />The Rating? 2/5.<br /><br />I, Da Ca$hman Signing Off.</p></body></html>

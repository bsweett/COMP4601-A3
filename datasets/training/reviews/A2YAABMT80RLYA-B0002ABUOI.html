<meta name="summary" content="Apocalypse Revisited - The new Dawn of the Dead"></head><body><p>Remakes of modern classics are inevitable, so this new version of George A. Romero's apocalyptic masterpiece "Dawn of the Dead" was about due, more than 25 years after the original was released. What surprised me is how much I enjoyed this remake, in the same way I enjoyed Tom Savini's underrated 1990 remake of "Night of the Living Dead", as an updated version that serves more as a tribute rather than a derivative knockoff. <p>This remake only resembles the original in setting and premise. The zombie pandemic sweeps over civilization overnight, causing widespread chaos from which few have survived. Seven survivors find each other and set up camp in a deserted shopping mall, which is convenient and protected. The survivors are a solid mix: A young sympathetic nurse (Sarah Polley), a grizzled cop (Ving Rhames), a level-headed Joe Everyman (Jake Weber), a young black professional (Mekhi Phifer), his pregnant Russian bride (Inna Korobkina, who has about two lines in the entire movie), and three loud mouthed security guards who cause the required tension. Unlike in the original, the mall itself is merely a setting, a place for survival. There are no satirical stabs at mindless consumerism that the original had, this is strictly a horror movie with a couple choice moments of humor thrown in. Don't expect to see zombies trying on hats or playing in the fountains. <p>Which brings us to the main attraction - the zombies. "Dawn of the Dead" will inevitably draw comparisons to "28 Days Later" for the fact that these zombies are a far cry from the slow, lurching zombies of George Romero's movies. These zombies will run up to you and rip you to pieces before you can look twice. They have no interest in the mall itself, just the people within. They only have one purpose - human flesh, and they are ravenous for it! The big kudos goes to the makeup effects people, who did a wonderful job making these zombies as nasty as possible. Aside from that, this new version has it's share of dramatic moments. Like the original, people bitten by the zombies invariably become zombies themselves, so the survivors have to make tough decisions when one of their own is bitten. The one element that is downplayed slightly is the apocalyptic subtext, where they could conceivably be the only people left in the world. The emotion associated with that kind of reality is not really expressed here. Instead, the filmmakers have focused on the character tension, the death scenes, and those wonderful fright gags that make up jump 10 inches off your chair. Be ready for them. <p>It would be too obvious to say that this remake is not as good as the original, because you simply cannot top a masterpiece, but the remake exceeded all my expectations. The style of filming, the acting (which is for the most part pretty good), and the Romero homages (which any fan will easily spot) make this a fun ride for horror fans, as well as a good introduction for people new to the genre. This will be a welcome addition to my horror collection when it comes out on DVD.</p></body></html>

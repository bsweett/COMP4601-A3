Stylish, atmospheric and beautifully photographed, directed and scored. The music, especially, is haunting and absolutely perfect; after all, this is Grand Guignol at it's finest hour, thanks to the Master, Ridley Scott. Even the gore is done in an operatic fashion, and when the Abattoir takes center stage (which is rather often), you are still hypnotized and mesmerised by the spectacle, the story and the images. Nothing is gratuitous; nothing is done for shock value, but rather, as an integral; part of the story. Sir Anthony Hopkins is Hannibal Lecter, and his speech, his subtle nuances, and his asides (one favorite is his exceeding delight in the moment just preceding the demise of someone who crossed his path and shouldn't have...alas, too late.) Lecter is such a fascinating character that even his worst moments are beautifully choreographed and served up as a new and tantalizing dish, exquisitely prepared for your pleasure alone. Irresistable...yet he is a fiend. What a gorgeous paradox! Ray Liotta is great, especially toward the end, and Julianne Moore (again, IMHO) makes a superior Starling. I do not like comparisons, but with Moore you get more into the character of Starling, and are not distracted by thinking it's Jodie Foster playing a part. Mason Verger, another remarkable character, who has excellent reasons of his own to capture Lecter, lives in isolation on his estate (the famous Biltmore House, built by George Vanderbilt, ((still privately owned and lived in, can you imagine living in such a place! by the great great grandson...))in Ashevillle, SC, and also used for &quot;Being There.&quot;) except for the beleagured doctor who he demeans at every opportunity, poor Caudell; and assorted faceless servants. When I read the book I was skeptical about displaying such a human ruin onscreen; but the effects are nothing less than remarkable...Verger portrayed by one of my favorite actors.<br />THIS is what moviemaking is all about; this should be used as a template in film schools/studies; it is flawless, not one moment of drag...but the character who made me saddest of all is the poor, fallen-from-grace Police Investigator, Giancarlo Gianinni; he evokes tremendous sympathy, even with a wife who is exquisite beyond words, and still has a good job, but falls prey to his own greed...perhaps for the benefit of his beautiful wife. The opera scene, the music, the streets, transports you away from wherever you are, which, of coure, should be the goal of all films, but in this case, it succeeds beyond any expectations. Magic. Only watch this on DVD! Nothing less will suffice or bring you the production as it is meant to be seen, in all it's glory...fantastic.</p></body></html>

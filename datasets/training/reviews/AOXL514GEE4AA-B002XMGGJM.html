Blu Ray review"></head><body><p>Clyde Shelton (Butler) is the lone survivor of a brutal home invasion in which his wife and daughter are murdered. The killers are soon caught and Nick Rice (Foxx), a hotshot prosecutor, is assigned to the case. Over Shelton's objection, Rice strikes a plea bargain with one of the suspects to testify against his accomplice. The story then flashes forward ten years. Shelton begins his revenge by killing the men who murdered his family. His plans are however much larger than that. He quickly is taken into custody and admits his guilt. Now confronted by Rice, he tells him more people will die unless he exposes the corruption in the system! Rice quickly finds himself in a cat and mouse game, where Shelton always seems two steps ahead!<br /><br />This was a good movie. Butler was excellent as always. I am not a fan of Foxx, but he was serviceable in this role. This is a great revenge tale. As a husband and father, I was rooting for Shelton all the way. However, this is not a 4 or 5 star film as some suggest. The revelations at the end of the movie are a little to far fetched and take away from the suspense that was so well put together for most of the movie. Still, it certainly is worth a watch.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: The film was sharp looking and the sound was good. This is not the type of movie that has a lot of eye candy. Most of the film takes place in dark and dingy settings. SPECIAL FEATURES: Nothing special here. Standard featurette stuff. FINAL THOUGHTS: If you are a fan of the film BLU RAY is the only way to get the UNRATED version. WORTHY OF OWNERSHIP</p></body></html>

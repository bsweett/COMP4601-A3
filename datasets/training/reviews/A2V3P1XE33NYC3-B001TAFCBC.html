The rubber faced Canadian comic has certainly come a long way since the days of "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" and "Dumb and Dumber." Heck, he's come a long way since his turn as The Riddler in one of the Batman movies. As far as I can tell, Carrey suffers from the same affliction that infected Steve Martin and Robin Williams, namely the disease that convinces wildly popular comedians to turn their backs on stand up in favor of careers as "serious" actors making "serious" films. Think about it. Martin went from such classics as "The Jerk" and "The Man with Two Brains" to "Grand Canyon" and "The Spanish Prisoner." Robin Williams's turn towards the dramatic is even starker. He turned in memorable comedic performances in the television series "Mork and Mindy" and movies like "The Survivor" before moving on to the depressingly downbeat "Jakob the Liar" and "One Hour Photo." What's going on? Well, once comedians hit it big, they worry about becoming pigeonholed in funny flicks. So they immediately seek out meatier roles, preferably ones with Oscar winning potential, in order to achieve longevity in Hollywood.<br /><br />"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" defies easy explanation. If I had to sum the film up in a few words, I'd say it's a story about how we need both good and bad memories to experience the fullness of life. How we get to that conclusion is the interesting part. The movie introduces us to a miserable looking chap named Joel Barish (Carrey) as he rides a train through the countryside on a rather bleak day. Our hero (or is it anti-hero?) has about had it with life. His biggest problem seems linked to bad relationships, but all of that is about to change when he runs into Clementine Kruczynski (Kate Winslet). The two immediately strike up a rapport, and it becomes quite clear that Joel and Clementine couldn't be further apart in demeanor. Barish slinks around as though he's trying to hide from the world, never talking above a hoarse whisper. Clementine is wild, with blue hair and an extroverted personality that screams, "Look at me!" Nonetheless, the old adage that claims opposites always attract seems to bear fruit here. Joel and Clementine strike up an intense relationship that soon finds them living together in a blissful state of love. As in many relationships, love doesn't last.<br /><br />One day Joel discovers that Clementine has decided she's not only had enough of him, but she's also decided to erase any memories of their time together with the help of a place called Lacuna, Inc. Run by a kindly doctor named Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), Lacuna operates a facility that can literally burn memories of any event out of a person's head. When Joel discovers what his love is up to, he decides to retaliate in kind. Unfortunately, once Barish is under the knife (metaphorically speaking) he decides that he doesn't want to lose his precious memories. What follows is a rollercoaster ride as recollections both good and bad fly through Joel's mind. We enter his mind and follow the pair's relationship backwards, at least I think it's backwards, and see how things went so wrong. We also see why Joel fell in love with this wonderful woman in the first place. The best parts of the film show us how Barish tries to hide Clementine in his childhood memories to protect her from Lacuna's invasive procedures. A subplot involving Mierzwiak and his subordinates Stan (Mark Ruffalo), Mary (Kirsten Dunst), and Patrick (Elijah Wood) plays a big role in the film's twist conclusion. "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" is definitely not your typical Hollywood romance flick.<br /><br />First and foremost, I want to commend Jim Carrey for his work in this film. Anyone who has seen his manic comedy bits and over the top acting skills will express the utmost astonishment at his incredibly subtle performance in this movie. He conveys a real sense of pain and vulnerability without coming across as forced or insincere. The actor also plays the comedic bits well, mainly the memories of his childhood, without going for broad slapstick. Just as excellent is Kate Winslet. I like this actress anyway, and would watch her in practically any movie she chooses to do, but she's quite good here. She plays off Carrey perfectly, and the two have great onscreen chemistry that makes a relationship between them more believable. I can't say I cared for the subplot involving the Lacuna employees, which I initially thought only added unnecessary clutter to a storyline that demands your full and undivided attention, but their presence becomes important as the film progresses. The conclusion wouldn't work, for example, without Mary giving Joel and Clementine some important items that help them figure out what's going on. I was appreciative of any help at this point because this is one confusing film. Subsequent viewings are practically mandatory.<br /><br />Listening to the commentary track helps. Director Michel Gondry and writer Charlie Kaufman shed a bit of light--perhaps sunshine is a better term--on the movie's intricate plot. A making of featurette and a conversation with Carrey and Gondry provide further insights. The disc also gives us deleted scenes, a music video, and an infomercial for Lacuna, Inc. I liked the movie immensely, but I'm not sure "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" rates highly as a date movie. My girlfriend quickly bored of the twisting plotlines and promptly fell asleep, leaving me to ponder the film's inimitable charms alone. Oh well. Watch Gondry's film, and then watch it again. It's worth your time.</p></body></html>

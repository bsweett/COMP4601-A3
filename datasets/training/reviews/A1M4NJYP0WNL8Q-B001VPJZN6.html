Much is due to Brett Ratner's ability to stay focused on creating an unselfconscious story line that sticks to the material and the atmospherics around it.  Another large amount is due to Anthony Hopkins ability to recreate a character who exudes evil and fear.  But the entire cast of this film manage to play their parts well.<br /><br />This is the prequel (or near prequel) to the events in Silence of the Lambs.  Edward Norton plays Will Graham, the FBI agent who brought Lector to justice in the first case.  He has 'escaped' from seeking serial killers and is now making an anonymous life repairing boats.  But his retirement is short-lived as Jack Crawford (Harvey Keitel) seeks Will out for help on a troubling case where entire families are being killed in a grim ritual.  As we quickly find out, one of the things that's wanted is for Will to work with Lector again, this time with the mad psychiatrist behind thick plate glass and bars.<br /><br />What we find out early in the film is that the new killer is somehow linked to the old.  Lector's uncanny ability to reach out and manipulate minds is still strong, and the real story is Will Graham's struggle to evade Lector's plans while trying to identify the killer with Lecter's help.  The detective and his family are the goats in a dark hunting game.<br /><br />Hopkins plays Lecter to perfection.  Not the slick Lecter of Silence, but as a man still developing his style.  For all his ego, Lecter's real problem is his inability to see Will Graham as anything but an alter-ego.  The agent, who survived catching Lecter only by accident has no such self-delusions.  His honest brilliance is a counterpoint to Lecter's deviousness.<br /><br />Another near perfect acting Job is done by Ralph Fienne, who plays Francis Dolahyde, the Red Dragon of the title.  This isn't a hysterical portrait.  Dolarhyde has his own brilliance despite his emotional ineptness, and Fienne brings this out perfectly, capturing Dolarhyde's fumbling love affair with Reba and his power as a controlled killer with surprising sympathy.<br /><br />The extras consist of commentaries, interviews and the usual 'making of' film.  I tend to look askance at the modern habit of expanding the credence of a film by piling on self-important tidbits, but these are well done, and enhance the viewing experience by surfacing some of the fine details that make this a successful film.</p></body></html>

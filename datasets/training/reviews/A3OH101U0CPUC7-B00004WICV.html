Tom Hanks and David Morse play prison guards on death row who get a new prisoner named John Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan.  Duncan is a mountain of a man and seems to be a simpleton but he has been sentenced to death for the murder of two little girls.  This moview is primarily a drama with a number subplots all concerning various inmates and guards at the prison.  An interesting turning point in the story occurs when Coffey demonstrates the ability to heal merely by touch.  The inclusion of this single element of fantasy into an otherwise harsh reality has tremendous impact and causes ripple throughout the rest of the movie.<br /><br />This film has a great cast from top to bottom whether it's the big names or the character actors who get typically little credit but give a great deal of depth to the movie.  Duncan steals the show as Coffey partly due to his sheer size but also because of the great warmth and decency he brings to the character.  Hanks does as fine a job as he ever has, and that's saying something.  The movie is a bit long but there is a lot of story to cover and I never felt like it dragged at all.<br /><br />In short, The Green Mile is an exceptional movie.  The script is unusually intelligent, the acting top notch, and the story keeps you interested throughout it's nearly three hour running time.  It certainly has an unorthodox story line but it works beautifully.  If you haven't seen the film yet, I would certainly recommend giving it a try.</p></body></html>

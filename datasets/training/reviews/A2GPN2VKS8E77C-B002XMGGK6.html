Gary Gray ("The Italian Job"). The movie makes you ponder how far is too far to get justice for the ones you love, and how clear-cut the line between good & evil is. Riveting from beginning to end. MILD SPOILER ALERT!!! In the end, the lesson is learned. MILD SPOILER ALERT OVER!!! MAJOR SPOILER ALERT!!! The movie should have shown what happened when Clyde set off the bomb at the end of the movie. MAJOR SPOILER ALERT OVER!!! Get ready to root for the criminal... or is he a criminal? Are we? Should have been rated PG-13.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Arguably The Scariest Movie Of All Time...#1 On My List..."></head><body><p>Back in 1973 when this terrifying shocker first came out, the reactions from movie audiences were all over the place. Some people came out of the movie nearly collapsing off of their feet; some people checked into therapy after seeing it; some people actually vomited in the theater; some people were so scared that they ran out of the theater and never came back. Whatever the reactions were, THE EXORCIST certainly has one of the most powerful reactions from any horror movie ever made. No one had any clue that director William Friedkin was out to make what is quite possibly the scariest film ever made of all time. After the first time you see this movie, even you will have trouble sleeping at night for at least a week.<br /><br />Linda Blair is terrific as the little girl who goes to hell and back, Regan; Max Von Sydow is terrific as Father Merrin; Jason Miller plays Father Karras to a tee; and Ellen Burstyn is perfect as Regan's mother. All of these actors convey such depth and emotion, and Blair truly is terrifying when she becomes the demon and speaks in the demon's voice. It...is...shocking.<br /><br />The story centers around a little girl named Regan, one of the nicest girls on the planet. She loves horses, plays games and jokes with her mother, and seems like the most down to earth kid. Little does she know of the terror that truly awaits her as the movie progresses. We know that Chris is an actress and quite a reputable one at that. As the movie goes on, Regan is getting a check up at the doctor's office when a most terrifying face is seen for a split second as she stares at the ceiling, and then suddenly she is quietly taken over by the demon. If you pause the movie right when the face comes up, you will get shivers down your spine. Just the way it looks at you and is smiling and the eyes, everything is just VERY scary. You won't notice it at first, but later Regan's behavior begins to change, especially after her outburst in the doctor's office. But it doesn't end there.<br /><br />As soon as Regan gets home, all the bad stuff begins to start unravelling one by one. One event that occurs where you know things are going terribly wrong is when Chris walks into the room and finds the windows all open with the chill in the air and Regan not under covers but facing down on her bed. The fact that you can see breath is chilling, but just knowing Regan is going to wreak havoc is absolutely terrifying. There are a two moments in the movie where "demon" Regan's head spins, but the first time you see it is dreadfully unsettling. According to Wes Craven, at that moment some lady got up from her seat, was screaming Spanish and ran out of the theater. The fact that director William Friedkin has no inhibitions about what he was going to show made the movie more powerful, minute by minute. Father Merrin has been made aware of the nature of Regan's "demonic" behavior by Father Karras, so they ultimately decide to perform an exorcism, and that scene between Regan, Merrin, and Karras has to be one of the most classic scenes in any horror movie. Everytime you hear the demon voice, see Regan in demon form, or see the bed shake or vomit spit, you jump back from your seat. It's a movie that's all about reaching deep down into the "chill" factor of your soul.<br /><br />Despite the sheer terror and frightening scenes depicted in this movie, there is no real gore and no real sex in the movie, despite the scene involving Regan and the crucifix. The film is actually stronger without any of those elements, it's an ultimately terrifying experience. The actors; the suspense; the demon effects and makeup; the storyline. Every element in this film works better than any other horror movie made in history.<br /><br />THE EXORCIST is at least one of the most horrifying experiences you'll ever witness in your life. Heralded as a classic by both critics and fans alike, this movie will stay in your mind for a long time. This is the most realistic and most documetary-like film about the portrayal of demonic possession. William Friedkin, you may have been genius, but this movie is pure madness...reach into the scare factor of your soul and watch THE EXORCIST...but never, I repeat, never watch it alone...and in the dark.</p></body></html>

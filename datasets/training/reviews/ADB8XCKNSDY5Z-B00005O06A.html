<meta name="summary" content="It took me 28 years to watch what it took 26 for this guy to make"></head><body><p>I wish I would have watched this movie earlier in my life.  It's so ridiculously hilarious.  I love Kane.  He reminds me of an over-the-top friend I had in college, except my friend had SOME stability.<br /><br />But if Kane had stability, where would his ambition have gone?  It would have taken a back seat to his stability.  Sort of like my desire for stability keeps me hushed up about the dream I have of promoting G-rated Shock Value.<br /><br />The message of this movie seems to be that personal ambition makes for an awesome story, but a horrible lifestyle.  No one watches this darn movie to see who or what Rosebud is.  People watch this movie to see the rise and fall of a man with an insane dream.  That's what makes the script of this movie so strong and gives it so many memorable quotes.  Kane clearly believes all the garbage he spews, even though he knows it's garbage.  Nowhere is this more clear than when he refuses to drop out of the race for governor.  For me, that's the defining moment of the film right there.<br /><br />Best movie of all time?  Eh, that's debatable.  While it's certainly up there with movies like Mary Poppins and Annie Hall, it's tough to pick which is THE best.  It should be enough to say I like everything about this film.</p></body></html>

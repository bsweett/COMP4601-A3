<meta name="summary" content="THE FOG IS KILLER!"></head><body><p>i have to say the fog is another of john carpenters good pieces of work. i kind of new is was going to be good, just cause of that, and he pulled it off. i have to admit though that this and the remake are on the same level for me. this was creepy, because you never really see those lost souls, and when you do, they're shadows. left to your imagination, which can play all sorts of things. it was good for it's time. it had some crazy slasher stuff in there. when they brought out those knifes and hooks boy did they let you have it. they didn't hold back, and i thought that was way nice. a sinister fog rolls into antonio bay on it's 100th birthday, bringing with it a crew with a thirst for revenge. a crew of people carrying a horrible desease, were lured to their deaths a 100 years ago, by a few men who were controlled by greed and fell back on their word. not only did these men steal their lives, but also their gold. taking everything, from these people who just wanted a little place to call home. the town of antonio bay was witness to a terrible secret. one many thought dead and gone, but on this night, it returns to seek the ones that are to blame. no one can escape the fog, that swallows you before you even know it. could there be an end to it. a life for a life. it's haunting, and in some ways unexpected. it had some of those moments where you kind of jerk a bit, and the ending was unforgettable. the cast was a nice one. tom atkins, good actor. adrienne barbeau, played her part very well. she just fell into character. as for jamie lee curtis, her acting speaks for itself. any role you give her, she'll outdo herself. of course she's a lot better know than she was then, but in this film she still manages to get your attention. good story, good actors, good movie.</p></body></html>

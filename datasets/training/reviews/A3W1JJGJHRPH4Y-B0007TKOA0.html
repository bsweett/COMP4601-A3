The movie is about friendship, love, obsession, and existential angst. The acting and casting are excellent: Giamatti, Church, Madsen and Oh are all very good. The story is bittersweet, but the movie has some very funny scenes. The movie is literate and intelligent. My favorite part is when the characters of Giamatti and Madsen discuss why they love wine. The movie gives me insight into an obsession and a world of which I am not familiar.<br /><br />There are several scenes where the characters are talking, eating, drinking wine and enjoying life and each other. The movie works in part, because the characters seem to enjoy each others company. There is nothing I really dislike about the movie. The two main characters are not very likeable, but the movie works because the characters are not perfect or even good people. They are two losers and that is the point.<br /><br />The DVD has extra features. The deleted scenes are okay, but nothing stands out. The commentary by Church and Giammatti is funny, but not very poignant. They really enjoyed making the movie and they have an enjoyable self-deprecating sense of humor.<br /><br />The movie is not perfect and not everybody will like it. However, like a good wine, it has complexity, character, and depth.</p></body></html>

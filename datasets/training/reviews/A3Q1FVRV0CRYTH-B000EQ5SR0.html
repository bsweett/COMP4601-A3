It's by no means terrible, but it's not amazing either.  Theron does an okay job but having this follow so closly to her oscar winning performance in Monster was a shock.  North Country was a worthy follow up, but this was more suited to her Sweet November days, back when she was nothing but eye candy, you know, not taken seriously.  I want to say that a few reviewers said it was hard to follow if you hadn't seen the series...NOT TRUE!!!  I've never seen the cartoon nor had any idea what it was about and I followed the film fine.  There are things they don;t want you to know right off bat and thats the point of an unraveling plot.  That's a good thing.  Anyways...the action is decent but nothing to write home about and thats the reason for my complaint...with a film like this you don't look for a plot or brilliant oscar worthy performances...you look for amazing fight scenes and amazing special effects and this movie only delivered minimally...so, it's kindof a let down.  So does Flux Suck?  Watch it, I mean it's worth at least one watch, that way you can have your own opinion.</p></body></html>

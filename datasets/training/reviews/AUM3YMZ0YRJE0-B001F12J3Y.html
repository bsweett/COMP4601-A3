I watched this with my kids and while they enjoyed it, they though a lot of it was rather strange.  First there is the spookiness of certain aspects of the train, like the bum who seems to live on the roof and appears at dangerous moments.  Then there are the sudden flights on huge hills or around the town at the N pole.  The kids are suddenly in an adventure that you know is destined to turn out OK, so they are there to use the special effects and maintain interest.  (The technical quality is also low, with wooden movements by the characters and gestures that don't look all that real, though perhaps we are now spoilt by Avatar.)  Finally, you get the xmass themes, but they are weirdly done, with creepy-looking elves you don't know you can trust.<br /><br />The best part of the film are the personalities of the kids, in particular the 3 principles.  There is a skeptical boy, a lonely black child, and an inhibited kid who probably comes from an unhappy or dysfunctional household.  They do interact well, even if they don't quite look alive.  You do feel some of the magic of xmass thru their eyes.<br /><br />I would recommend this tepidly.  It isn't awful, but I would never say it is great.</p></body></html>

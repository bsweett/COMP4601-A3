<meta name="summary" content="Heat Sizzles"></head><body><p>"Heat" is one of the great films of the 1990's.  Michael Mann has crafted a film that is intricate and deliberately paced but never boring.  One of the best ensemble casts of all time has been assembled for this film and, for the most part, these are fully developed characters.  Central to this film are the main stars, Robert DeNiro as the thief, and Al Pacino as the detective out to catch him.  Though appearing together in only a couple of scenes, there is an intricate cat and mouse game played by these two adversaries and also a mutual respect.  Essentially these two individuals live by a code of their respective trades and their adherence to these codes lead to a lonely existence.  As previously stated, the large ensemble cast(Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Ashley Judd, etc.) is excellent.  The highlight of the film is an elaborately staged bank heist and the subsequent getaway.  This film also has great editing, particularly in the above mentioned scene, great dusky cinematography of Los Angeles, and good music.</p></body></html>

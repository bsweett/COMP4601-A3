I'm not saying that is a bad thing (we all know that I am not the biggest Spike Lee fan) but the fact that it doesn't truly feel like a Spike Lee film is significant.  Sure, Lee inserts his views on race relations when he has the chance (please get off it for once) but the brisk pace and overall plot development feel like something far removed from director Spike Lee.  Whether this is a good thing or a bad thing to the viewer is entirely up to that individual.<br /><br />Personally I found the pacing a welcomed change.  It was easier to follow and more engaging than some of Lee's more preachy endeavors, and while it lacks the depth and pristine command that Lee exhibited in `25th Hour' it manages to keep my interest throughout.<br /><br />I was entertained.<br /><br />At the films open we are introduced to Dalton Russell.  Pay close attention for he chooses his words carefully.  He basically tells you all the films secrets in the opening scene, but you won't get it, at least not yet.  He is going to rob a bank.  Next thing you know the bank is sealed and Dalton and his accomplices take everyone hostage, making them don jumpsuits and stripping them of their cell phones and keys.  Outside the bank Detective Keith Frazier (in search of a promotion) takes on the task of negotiating the safety of the hostages with Dalton, but there is no outsmarting that man who has no doubt thought this through.<br /><br />Sadly, it feels at times like the screenwriter didn't do the same.  There are plot holes that stick out like sore thumbs, especially as the plot twists start revealing themselves.  The side plot involving Arthur Case (the bank owner) and the `fixer' he hires is a tad convoluted and needed a little tweaking.  Parts of the execution regarding Dalton's escape are also a bit of a stretch, but it's nothing that takes away from the enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />Just don't think about it too hard.<br /><br />The performances are a delight here though.  Clive Owen is a very effective actor who has consistently presented himself wonderfully on screen.  He's able to engage the audience from the moment he opens his mouth (that voice) but he also has the ability to sustain our attention with the light in his eyes.  Denzel Washington was a nice surprise here as well.  He was able to keep his charm controlled as apposed to allowing it to run wild as he often does.  This is probably one of his better performances, for he found the proper balance in his style of acting.  Christopher Plummer does what he can with his character, and he does it very well; but he is upstaged (as is everyone) by Jodie Foster.  Seriously, what in the world has she been doing?  Where was this amazing and commanding force back when she was winning Oscars for performances that were beneath her obviously?  I mean what she does here is leagues ahead of a lot of her more acclaimed performances.<br /><br />LOVED IT!!!<br /><br />In the end `Inside Man' is a very interesting and enjoyable heist film.  It is not as smart as it appears to be, nor as intelligent as it wants to be, but it is as fun as it claims to be so check it out.  The performances and the quick paced action will keep you glued even if the films preposterousness wages war on you later on.  Just turn your mind off for a few hours and enjoy a good popcorn flick.</p></body></html>

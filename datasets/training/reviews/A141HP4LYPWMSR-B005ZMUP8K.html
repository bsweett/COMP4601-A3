<meta name="summary" content=""Hello Beastie" ~ Depp And Davey In A Classic Confrontation"></head><body><p>`Pirates of the Caribbean - Dead Man's Chest' released on `06 is the highly anticipated second installment of the Captain Jack Sparrow trilogy. While Captain Jack and the film doesn't retain the humor and lighthearted charm of the first film, it does compensate for the loss of innocence with a dark, haunting Lovecraftian vision and some of the most amazing special effects to date. Wait till you see the Kraaken.<br /><br />Make no mistake `Dead Man's Chest' does have some flaws. It doesn't quite hold your attention as well as the first, there are some undeniable slow sections and the film is a little too long overall. However it still contains lots of witty lines of dialogue from your favorite pirate and a surprising number of unexpected twists in the plots. The ending is absolutely perfect leaving you breathless for installment three. Ah that Disney really knows how to do it, don't they. Not as good as the first film, but it doesn't miss by much.</p></body></html>

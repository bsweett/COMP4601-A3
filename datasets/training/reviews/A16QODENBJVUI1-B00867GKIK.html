<meta name="summary" content="Another masterpiece from Pixar"></head><body><p>There is probably no name I trust more today in film and television than Pixar (with the exception of Mutant Enemy).  Both the quality of their productions and the excellence of their scripts stand out among animated films.  I particularly loved this one because it shatters all previous templates for what a film is supposed to be about.  The main protagonist is a 78-year-old man who bears a resemblance to to Spencer Tracy and his main traveling companion is a young, rotund Asian boy scout.  Along the way they acquire a delightfully absurd and gigantic bird and a talking dog (while I saw this film I was reading Clifford D. Simak's CITY, which features several talking dogs, so for a while talking dogs were a motif in my cultural life).  All of this while attempting to relocate a house carried by thousands of helium-filled balloons to a mythical spot in South America called Paradise Falls.  And the entire affair was prefaced by a story within the story, of the story of Carl and Ellie's long life together.<br /><br />I've yet to see a Pixar movie that wasn't a complete delight.  And as for the appropriateness for small children, I would not hesitate to show it to one.  I think a child will find it entertaining, moving, and inspiring.  The messages in the film are good, positive ones and I not only think that children can see this film without harm, but should be encouraged to do so.</p></body></html>

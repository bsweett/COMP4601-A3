<meta name="summary" content="HITCHCOCK'S  MASTERPIECE"></head><body><p>Alfred Hitchcock's VERTIGO is one of the 50 best movies ever made. I personally know one person who watches it every two months and still discovers in this movie some food for his mind. It's true that VERTIGO has been analyzed in numerous books after the brilliant articles in &quot;The Cahiers du Cin&eacute;ma&quot; written by the future heroes of the Nouvelle Vague : Claude Chabrol, Jean-Luc Godard and Fran?ois Truffaut. VERTIGO is one of this movies which directly speaks to your heart if you're a cinephile, like Peter Bogdanovich's THE LAST PICTURE SHOW or John Ford's THE SEARCHERS.<p>Why does this particular movie speak to me more than the others ? For a simple reason, James Stewart is the mirror through which every cinephile can recognize himself. During long moments, Alfred Hitchcock films James Stewart in his car following Kim Novak ; no words are spoken, there is only Bernard Hermann's musical score and the face of James Stewart. At this moment, you are staring with intensity at a man who stares with intensity at a beautiful woman you too would like to stare at with intensity. Then, you enter the movie lover's vertigo, you become James Stewart.<p>No need to say that VERTIGO was the first DVD I've bought and should have a place, in my opinion, in any honest man's library (in the XVIIIth century meaning of the word). English, spanish and french subtitles, a commentary, trailers, the second ending and other goodies. <p>A DVD which is already in your library.</p></body></html>

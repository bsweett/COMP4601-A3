<meta name="summary" content="dolls never scared me this much before"></head><body><p>I wasn't expecting much out of this movie to be totally honest.  I mean, come on, another "dolls come to life and kill innocent people" movie?  How many of those have their been?  How can this movie do what hasn't been done a thousand times already?<br /><br />Well, maybe Dead Silence didn't break any new ground in the horror genre, and the movie certainly isn't miles above other similar kinds of horror storylines, but what it succeeded in doing was scare the living heck out of me, and the best thing of all was that the dolls were VERY unpredictable in how they chose to torture and kill people.<br /><br />In other words, the dolls didn't always come to life at the moment the people turned their backs- oh sure, *sometimes* they would, but most of the time not.  That was a surprising highlight for me and added a bit of creativity to the horror genre.  You were never sure when they were going to strike.<br /><br />Of course we ALL get the creeps thinking about dolls moving their eyeballs around, and that happens here.<br /><br />The storyline is really good too, because it's half mystery/half horror.  It's about a young husband trying to figure out what or who was possessing the dolls to come to life and kill people (and his wife).  The story works, because there was tons of suspense, and you got the feeling something frightening was going to happen at any moment.<br /><br />Another thing that scared the pants straight off my legs was what happened just BEFORE the dolls would go into "killing mode".  The surroundings would gradually become quiet, and whatever was making a sound would give off this frightening dying sound (similar to playing a cassette tape in a tape player with low batteries).<br /><br />Then the people would hear nothing but silence (hence the name of the movie) and the dolls would do their cold-hearted killing spree on whoever was around.<br /><br />Very good movie worth watching over and over.</p></body></html>

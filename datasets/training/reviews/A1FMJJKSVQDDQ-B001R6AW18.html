<meta name="summary" content=""Why'd you think I brought all those gas bombs?""></head><body><p>To be perfectly honest, I always have mixed reactions about all three King Kong films: the original 1933 version, the 1976 remake, and the 2005 remake. I love 2005's special effects and the perfected image of the giant ape, but having it set in '33 again didn't make it all very special. I found Grodin's performance in 1976 very over-the-top, but the chemistry between girl and ape really improved. Now with 1933, it's also a mixed bag. Yes, it's am absolute classic and it brought an entire galaxy of upcoming monster movies. Fay Wray, Robert Armstrong, and Bruce Cabot gave terrific performances. The music is authentically primitive. The special effects are still spectacular and revolutionary, even if they do look very outdated in our modern time. But why did I give this movie four stars instead of five? Well, it's because, since it was still a very early time, King Kong and Ann Darrow are both very . . . two-dimensional. Here, Kong is just a monstrous ape, and we see him only as a plain antagonist. At least 1976 and 2005 gave him a slightly better personality: he's a beast who finds himself someone that he has fully cherished for the first time. Ann Darrow does nothing but scream whenever she's with Kong, and since it was way back in 1933, she's really a typical damsel in distress, and she finds nothing fascinating about Kong.<br /><br />So yes, I have mixed feelings for all three Kong films. I do like them all for very specific reasons, but I don't consider any of them as a favorite of mine.</p></body></html>

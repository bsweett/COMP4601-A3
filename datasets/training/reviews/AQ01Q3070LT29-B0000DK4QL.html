<meta name="summary" content="David Keith, Paul Ben-Victor, Colin Farrell, what a cast!"></head><body><p>Yet, another Marvel movie.  This one came as a surprise.  Ben Affleck as the Daredevil superhero and Colin Farrell as the villian &quot;Bullseye&quot;.  If this film did not have Colin Farrell in it, I probably would not have  seen this film on DVD and there is an &quot;Easter Egg&quot; in the &quot;Beyond Hell's Kitchen&quot; frame. Just press the left arrow on your DVD remote.  I enjoyed this film better than the recent Spiderman and the first hour of The Hulk (2003). I was surprised to see David Keith (An Officer And A Gentleman), an actor I like, as the Daredevil's father and a boxer.  Good casting there.  Also an excellent cast of Joe Pantoliano and Paul Ben-Victor.  By the way, keep watching the end credits.  There is a funny clip of Colin Farrell as &quot;Bullseye&quot; that changes the story and the entire fate of his character.  This DVD package is a 2-Disc set.</p></body></html>

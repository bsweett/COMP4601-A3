<meta name="summary" content="OK to see once"></head><body><p>A well acted, spooky movie, but once you have seen it there is no need to see it again.  All the action is based upon what is revealed at the end of the movie, so a second viewing leaves one wondering why they are wasting time watching the movie.  Unless you just like the acting.  Rent first, then decide if you want a copy in your library.</p></body></html>

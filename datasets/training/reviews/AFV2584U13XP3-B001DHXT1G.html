<meta name="summary" content="Great With Keeping With The Hulk Story But Not A True Must See Movie"></head><body><p>I have to say neither the movie or the actors were bad if at all the actors portraying the characters did incredibly well but this movie just for some reason did not keep my attention unlike the X-men movies.  If you've read the comics for the early years of the Hulk Bruce Banner was hunted like this by the government to use him and how Bruce tries to contain or control his Hulk Persona and I like that the movie shows the same thing.  I can't say if it's either because I've read the comics or just wanted to see the big fight between Hulk and Abomination but I found myself wanting to skip through the scenes in between the Hulk scenes and the final fight.  But if you haven't read the comics or seen the first Hulk Movie I do advise not skipping the scenes otherwise you will become confused on what is happening.  The video and audio for the blu-ray version are incredible nicely detailed and sharp and hearing the effects are astounding.  So I say while the movie doesn't reach the level of the X-men movies I put it in the same rank as Iron Man or the Fantastic Four movies.  So if you like the comic book movies this one is a good choice for you....</p></body></html>

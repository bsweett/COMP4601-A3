<meta name="summary" content="Eye opening and disturbing"></head><body><p>This was more of a disturbing eye opener than an enjoyable movie for pure entertainment's sake. However, it makes a valid point, which may have been Hollywood's goal. The power of greed and the futility and brutal price of war. I would have liked a more hopeful ending, but perhaps the intent was a realistic lesson in political unrest and the hands that feed them weapons of 'mass destruction'.<br /><br />Chrissy K.

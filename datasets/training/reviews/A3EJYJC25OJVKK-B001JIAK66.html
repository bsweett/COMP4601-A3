<meta name="summary" content="Flawed but fun movie."></head><body><p>Ok I was rather skeptical about the whole concept of this movie but went anyway just to see Hugh Jackman after his phenomenal acting as Wolverine in the X-Men movies. The whole concept of Dracula and Frankenstein topics sounds extremely cheesy and almost laughable to me at first. However, I was surprised because "Van Helsing" turned out to be a surprisingly great movie and blew all of my expectations right out into the ocean. <p> A special operative named Gabriel Van Helsing is a mysterious man who hunts demons and vampires in the streets of 1880s Paris and London but is assigned to hunt down a murderous vampire named Count Vladius Dracula who aims to spread evil and horrors all over humanity and Van Helsing travels to Transylvania where his world collides with a young woman, the last descendant of a family that has been dedicated to ridding the world of evil for centuries and now aims to destroy Dracula for good after the atrocities he's committed including murdering her father. Dracula has also been sending out a large swarm of smaller vampires hatched in his lair to exterminate the residents of a nearby town in the Transylvanian Mountains. Princess Anna's family has made it's vow that it will not enter heaven until Dracula is destroyed for good and Van Helsing is the only one who can really in fact can do just that. <p> I actually found the movie to more fun than scary for the most part but some of the scenes were pretty intense to watch and some were a bit much for me. This movie isn't necessarily one for the thinking crowd but "Van Helsing" is nonetheless a really fun and action-packed flick that is a really great homage to the classic 1930s through 1950s horror movies and brings back a lot of the old-fashioned styles of the past. In some ways too it also breaks some of the predictable elements of vampire films of the past. It almost even sheds a totally new light on the classic Frankenstein monsters of old. <p>This movie has it's share of flaws such as some hammy acting in some spots and awkward storyline but a lot of them are bypassed because this movie is just plain fun and worth killing a couple of hours. It is no masterpiece or even an amazing film by any stretch of the imagination but it is certainly worth a look...that is if you aren't willing to watch a movie that requires intellectualization but instead is like mind popcorn to munch on and that's what matters here. If you loved "The Mummy" and "The Mummy Returns" then "Van Helsing" is worth the buck.</p></body></html>

I knew as soon as I took it out of the box I was in trouble. The cover picture is horrible beyond words, those stupid poses! I knew I was about to watch a horrible Hollywood assembly line piece of garbage. Upon watching I wanted to wretch. How did they talk these actors into this so called fim?? I went and traded it at my local pc games/cd/dvd store for 2 horror films.<br /><br />Avoid this at all cost....</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Eastern Promises" Doesn't Quite Deliver!!"></head><body><p>Alright, I originally saw the previews for this movie while watching another movie in the theater.... "Eastern Promises" plot/storyline sounded intriguing to say the least.<br /><br />I recently saw this movie on dvd rental and it was awful!! It is slow, incredibly, heart-wrenchingly slooooow to watch!! Several times I wanted to stop this movie and just return it. I kept watching "Eastern Promises"  as I figured it must have a good ending but it didn't. There were lots of loose ends that weren't adequately answered at the end of the movie. Lots of themes/topics were superficially touched upon, but never quite explored in the kind of detail that could have made this a movie an all around great one.<br /><br />Naomi Watts & Viggo Mortensen were the only shining stars in this movie as their acting was the best part of the entire film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Wolverine Back Story Bash -- A Fair Interpretation!"></head><body><p>You wanted the animal, you got the animal.<br /><br />The story starts early in 1840's Canada Northwest Territories (history tells us this section of Canada was not "Northwest Territories" until 1870 but this is a review, not a history lesson) -- with Wolverine as a child living with his brother and father.  Seems Logan is a mutant and has bone claws when he gets emotionally distraught.  When his father is killed by a gunshot, Logan gets very angry and slices the guy who did it, who turns out, in his dying breath is Logan's actual father.<br /><br />What?<br /><br />No explanation on why this is and it has nothing to do with the rest of the story, other than a plot device to have Logan and his brother (Sabertooth) escape into the forest to fend for themselves.<br /><br />A very fast run through American wars -- Civil, WWI, WWI, Vietnam -- (what happened to Korea?  Oh well) -- find Logan's brother loving the bloodlust to a point where he enjoys killing and nearly rapes a Vietnamese woman until Logan steps in.  Even so, Logan watches his brother's back.<br /><br />Somewhere in there Logan's wife is apparently killed -- more tragedy -- and when Striker steps in, the most oily, sly, deceitful military man in film history, convinces the mutant pair that they were made for better things.<br /><br />Logan gets the adamantium bones and basically escapes with his life.<br /><br />The director found it necessary to fill time, so he gives us an old farm couple that takes in Logan.  Hardly five minutes goes by when they're mercilessly gunned down by Striker's forces.  Why?  Such an unnecessary part of the story and did nothing for the plot other than what a bastard Stryker is, but we knew that.<br /><br />And a CGI version of Patrick Stewart was very, very disappointing!<br /><br />There's a post-credit scene at a bar that does nothing to liven interest in the plot at all.<br /><br />The comic book movie succeeds in filling in the missing holes in Wolverine's past but has enough Swiss cheese in the storyline to begin entering Daredevil territory (YES, I said it!).<br /><br />The brief intro with Gambit and Deadpool was entertaining but disappointingly little was done to flesh out these characters,<br /><br />Rental!<br /><br />Better:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HEVZ9E">X-Men Trilogy (X-Men/ X2 - X-Men United/ X-Men - The Last Stand)</a></p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="L.A. Confidential  (1997)"></head><body><p>Director:  Curtis Hanson<br />Cast:  Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, James Cromwell, David Strathairn, Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito.<br />Running Time:  156 minutes.<br />Rated R for violence, language, and some sexuality.<p>A toast and dedication to the fine film noir classics that evolved in the 1940's and 1950's, "L.A. Confidential" is a cop story told the way it should be--intellectually, right in your face, and with a spice of humor.  Based on the bestselling novel by James Ellroy, this crime caper is a masterpiece of suspense, sensuality, and straight-up heroism.<p>After a holiday mishap at the police station in which several officers brutally beat up inmates and a killer maniacally shoots and kills numerous victims at a local bar, detectives Kevin Spacey and Russell Crowe search for answers.  Spacey is a high-profile cop who benefits from raunchy tablod writer Danny Devito's busts of movie stars and political figures, while Crowe is wonderul as the straight-laced detective who finds his life in shambles of corruption as he gets closer and closer to the truth, and also as he gets more involved with one of an enigmatic millionare's erotic hookers (Kim Basinger in a knock-out role).  Guy Pearce plays the up-and-coming son of a police station legend who will do whatever it takes to get a promotion, including selling out his colleagues and stealing their girls.<p>Excellent adaptation of the wonderful novel, using the cast to create a rigorous, enveloping story that will keep audience's guessing until the very last second.  Bold, telling performances from the entire cast, especially Crowe (which should have been at least Oscar-nomination worthy) and Pearce (who steals the show from Crowe time to time).  Action-packed, character driven, and as smart of a crime drama as you will ever find.  Certainly one of the best, if not THE best of its kind made in the 1990's.  Was very unfortunate to be overshadowed by the juggernaut "Titanic"; could very well of won Best Picture.  The DVD has some special behind the scenes documentaries--check out "Off the Record"--which contains interviews from the film's creators, lead actors and novelist James Ellroy.</p></body></html>

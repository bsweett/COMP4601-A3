The subtexts, however, about an angel, Guy Noir, and the death of an old man were pointless and obtuse.  The Tommy Jones cameo was somewhat effective and clear cut, although a bit over-the-top. Meryl and Lily had good chemistry.  The cowboys were funny.  However, overall better just to listen to the show on the radio.</p></body></html>

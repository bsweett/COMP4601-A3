<meta name="summary" content="Amazing!!! This film defies expecations"></head><body><p>I was very surprised by this film, as it was fresh, clever, and not predictable. It plays with your expectations and goes in a surprising direction each time. The premise reeled me in, as this film is about a man who has been at a Sports Magazine his whole working life and during a merger, he suddenly finds himself working for someone young enough to be his son. Such tensions are relevant in today's immoral corporate culture where loyalty and longevity are no longer valued, where people are only as good as their last ad campaign.<br /><br />Dennis Quaid as an actor has done an amazing thing in this century, as his roles and movie choices have improved. I'm not sure if this is positive side effect of his falling out with Meg Ryan (whose career, on the other hand, only suffered since their 2000 breakup). Between Kevin Costner and Dennis Quaid, Kevin was my favorite in the 1990s, but now I think Dennis Quaid has the upper hand. He is great in this film and comes across as a decent person...someone you'd love to have as a boss.<br /><br />Topher Grace is amazing, as he is in every film I've seen him in so far. He has the nervous, fidgety, inexperienced, fresh-out-of-college-and-in-way-over-his-head persona down perfectly. He makes a good team with Dennis Quaid and I like the juxtaposition between the breakup of Topher's marriage against the strength of Dennis' marriage. What I get from watching this film is that while our corporations may value the young hotshots who lack experience but make up for that in arrogance, that sometimes, experience does matter. A person who believes in his job and is committed to it is a far better person to be promoted than one who is only using the company as a stepping stone to bigger and better things. If anyone doubts this...look at Enron and the lack of loyalty to the company there. Incompetence should never be rewarded, no matter how "brilliant" some upstart might seem.<br /><br />The ending wasn't typical of most Hollywood films and its a logical ending that works out for the best for everyone involved. Scarlett Johannsen is good in this film, and even though I didn't buy her relationship with Topher Grace, it was an interesting subplot to the whole film. Besides the story and acting, I also loved the music of the soundtrack. All in all, the film makes some good points about our corporate culture even though the big dramatic scene was a bit of a stretch (when Dennis Quaid questions the head honcho). None of the flaws take away from the overall beauty of this film. It is worth seeing and owning.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It wasn't the best movie I've seen"></head><body><p>Ok kids, if a stranger in a vehicle pulls up next to you and offers you a ride to the North Pole...DO NOT GET ON!<br /><br />That was my first problem with this movie. All of the kids who got on the train used poor judgment. But it's only a movie right? Ok. I thought a lot of the movie looked more creepy than cheerful. The North Pole is an industrial wasteland. The elves are pretty creepy and Santa seems more mean than jolly.<br /><br />The visuals are pretty but the animators ran into trouble with the eyes and mouths of the characters. The eyes looked dead and the mouths were stiff.<br /><br />And did anybody else find the Jewish elf amusing? It seemed kind of out of place in a Christmas movie. But notably, this movie had nothing at all to do with Christ.</p></body></html>

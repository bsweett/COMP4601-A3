<meta name="summary" content="Dramatically Weak, But Eastwood Rises Above the Flaws"></head><body><p>With both Asian and Polish ancestry and having grown up only an hour or so away from Detroit, I found watching "Gran Torino" a surreal experience.  Having at one time or another been called every vile term his Walt Kowalski levels with complete ease at his Hmong neighbors, I know the film ain't lying about the generally overlooked and often discounted racism against Asians in the U.S., but at the same time, I've never met anyone, let alone anyone Polish, with the unceasing vitriol that defines Walt's very existence.  In this, he falls into that narrow range of choices Hollywood makes for ethnic groups; if Italians must be gangsters and pizza makers or the Irish cops and bartenders, then Walt has to be the stereotypical racist, drunken, blue-collar Polack.  (He has plenty of company -- for starters, think Marlon Brando in "A Streetcar Named Desire" and Mickey Rourke in "Year of the Dragon.")  Oh, make no mistake, factory workers, including ones in my own family, could put away the beer, but Walt might well put two or three of these red-blooded guys under the table, even if I can't for the life of me remember any of them ever even contemplating reaching for a Pabst Blue Ribbon.<br /><br />But all this is understandable because despite its illusion of grit, "Gran Torino" exists in a gauzy fantasy space that allows suburban moviegoers to confront the real ugliness of bigotry, even their own, from a safe, artificial distance, like staring down that lion at the zoo that in the wild would be feasting on their bones.  Once again, Walt falls into another familiar Hollywood trope: the flawed white guy who must overcome his prejudices to help beleaguered minorities who can't help themselves.  Oh, and he's haunted by a war with Asians.  And his family is a bunch of jerks.  And he's dying, too.  If it sounds like I'm being too hard on "Gran Torino," a film that's wowed both critics and audiences, perhaps I am, but it's mostly because I truly like and expect more of Clint Eastwood, even moreso now that he's deservedly come into his own as a filmmaker with fare like "Letters from Iwo Jima."  Even here, he gives a performance that rises above the predictable story and hokey setups that too often mar the intent of "Gran Torino" to be taken seriously as a drama rather than a melodrama, and more importantly, a meaningful statement on racial harmony.  But I'm also struck by the nagging feeling that if it wasn't for the presence of Eastwood, playing what in many ways is a geriatric version of Dirty Harry, the same people lauding the film might not be shrugging at its mediocrity (and, no, I'm not referring to the sincere but sometimes uneven performances of his Hmong co-stars).  What's left are a lot of funny lines, mostly because of the brazenness of Walt's racism, a few touching moments between Walt and Sue and Tao, the two kids he will grow closest to, and an ending that's a "gotcha" you'll see coming from a mile away.<br /><br />Still -- and this is part of the surreality -- seeing an 80-year-old Eastwood sticking an M-1 rifle in a punk's face and snarling "Get off my lawn" is almost worth the price of admission alone.  It, too, is a cliche, but one of the few that the writers manage to cleverly turn on its head.</p></body></html>

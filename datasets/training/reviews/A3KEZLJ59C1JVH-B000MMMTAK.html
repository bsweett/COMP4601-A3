However, my overall opinion of this film is that it's truly tasteless and incredibly offensive to just about everyone.<br /><br />The film follows Kazakhstan journalist Borat Sagdiyev (Sacha Baron Cohen) on his journey across America. In addition to filming a documentary, Borat falls madly in love with Pamela Anderson after watching an old "Baywatch" rerun, and he desperately tries to get to California in order to make Pamela his wife so he can have "the sexy time" with her.<br /><br />Yes, "Borat" can be pretty funny at times. How can you NOT laugh at a man traveling across the country in an ice cream van with a grizzly bear in the rear compartment? However, there are a lot of things in the film that cross the line in terms of poking fun at women, Jews, etc. I probably could have taken all that in stride, though, if not for all the other crude elements of this movie. All the jokes about rape and bestiality were really pushing it, but the nakedness proved to be too much for me, especially the much-talked about nude fight scene between Borat and his travel companion, Azamat (Ken Davitian). Watching the two of them chase each other through the hotel nearly blinded me for life.<br /><br />"Borat" is good for a few cheap laughs, but I think it's an extremely uncouth film that isn't worthy of all the attention it has generated.</p></body></html>

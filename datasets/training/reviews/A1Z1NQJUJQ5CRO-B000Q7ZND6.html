<meta name="summary" content="3 1/2 stars-More promise than results!"></head><body><p>The Feb/2005 released movie Constantine,based on the Hellblazer comic series,comes to DVD in a widescreen edition that is interesting in its premise but falters in its' delivery.<br />The story involves one John Constantine(Keanu Reeves)who has always had the ability to see things people weren't "meant to see".He has done alot of bad things in his life and he has tried to atone for them by working against evil so when he goes his path will lead up and not down.One day he is approached by a police woman named Angela Dodson(Rachel Weisz)to help her regarding her twin sister's untimely death;a plunge off of a roof.At first John balks but relents,soon realizing there is more to the death than meets the eye.John journeys to the other side and back and even assists Angela in doing the same,but they realize too late that her sisters death was basically a ruse to get at Angela.<br />John learns that the archangel Gabriel is actually working with the son of the devil to unleash his progeny onto the world.In order to do this Angela becomes the host for the child and the angel will use the "spear of destiny"(the actual tip of the lance that was used to kill Jesus on the cross)to open her womb and release evil to rule man.Gabriel reckons that only those that survive the time to come will be worthy of God's real salvation.In the meantime John has summoned the Devil himself in a last ditch attempt to foil the Devil's son and the archangel's plans.The Devil indeed stops the birth and renders the angel wingless and earth bound.He returns to John who asks that Angela's sister be let free from Hell in his stead.This is a sacrifice and the Devil has been tricked but in one last effort to keep John from going heavenward,he removes the lung cancer that is killing him and keeps him earth bound to live out his life;hoping one day he will slip up and be his forever.<br />The movie has ALOT of promise throughout with an interesting plot of good versus evil playing out between a man desperate to be redeemed and the evil that would take over the world.The special effects are well done especially in the fight scenes and those involving the glimpses of Hell.However the side plots of Angela and her sister,his side kick Chas Kramer(Shia LaBeouf),his priest friend Father Hennessy(Pruitt Vince)and other characters are just dealt with so heavy handedly,that the plot's narrative flow suffers considerably everytime we go from the action scenes and back to the plot/character advancement.It's a stop/start of a roller coaster ride that detracts from the overall enjoyment of the film.The only three characters I found engaging at all and enhanced the film to any degree,besides Reeve's Constantine,were John's friend Scavenger(Jesse Ramirez),Gabriel(Tilda Swinton) and a beautifully played evil Satan by Peter Stormare.The others were just nondescript window dressing.<br />Technically this film has been transferred well and is presented in its wide screen format.Extras include 18 minutes of so called "additional scenes" which are nothing other than expanded or alternate scenes;with or without commentary.There is also the theatrical trailer.This DVD is actually Disc One of the original two disc release version,just so you know.<br />In conclusion I found Constantine one with a unique and different take on the whole Angels versus Demons,good versus evil chestnut,but overall the plot is a roller coaster of stops and starts which detract from its flow and overall enjoyment;despite the good S/FX.It could/should have been better.I recommend it as a little above average.</p></body></html>

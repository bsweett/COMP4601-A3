Sometimes whole stories can be seen as they talk about stories of their character's past. Clint Eastwood makes sure each character has their own strengths and weaknesses:<br /><br /> From a young man who wants to be a boxer who suffers abuse from his fellow boxers in a gym, to an old gym-caretaker played by Morgan Freeman [Scrap] who narrates the movie and offers help to Hilary Swanks character [Maggie].<br /><br />Even Clint Eastwood's character Frankie Dunn, who gives a great perfromance as a man who went from not caring much about female boxers, manages to find himself caring for Maggie near the end of the movie. I found Maggie's and Frankie's relationship in the movie genuwine and heartwarming, as a young female hopeful shows up at Frankie's gym just asking for a chance for Frankie to train her.<br /><br />The movie shows us some great boxing fights as Maggie steadily climbs to the top of the female brand. A first round knockout in about 10 seconds was considered normal for one of Maggie's fights. Frankie even has to go and pay other trainers to put their fighers in with Maggie after a while, but even that stops after a few more fights.<br /><br />I've heard some people comment on how slow the second half of the movie is after the accident [No spoilers ahead, so don't worry] But again, its the DIALOGUE that is what makes this movie. How Frankie transforms into this caring man who becomes great friends with Maggie, and Scrap manages to get his 110th fight he so desperately wanted.<br /><br />This is one of the best acting movies in the year 2004, quite arguably THE best, but thats for you to decide. No wonder it won 4 Academy Awards.<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />The extras on this DVD are:<br /><br />Theatrical Trailer<br /><br />James Liptin takes on three: Where Clint Eastwood, Morgan Freeman, and Hilary Swank talk to the Moderator, James Liptin.<br /><br />Born to Fight: A great look on how the movie was closely related to actuall boxing.<br /><br />Producers Round 15: Just behind the scenes footage.<br /><br />This DVD is definately reccommended.......</p></body></html>

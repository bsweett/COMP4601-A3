<meta name="summary" content="A few flaws, but overall a fantastic film"></head><body><p>As a die-hard fan of the Harry Potter books, I can honestly say that I enjoyed this movie very much, although a few things about the film could have been better.<br /><br />The best thing about "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" is that the producers were smart enough to split the final installment of J.K. Rowling's brilliant wizard saga into two films. As a result, not nearly as much content from the book was cut for Part I of "Deathly Hallows" as has been the case with the other HP movies. The book chronicles Harry, Ron, and Hermione as they decide to abandon their final year of education at Hogwarts and set off on a quest to take down the evil Lord Voldemort. What begins as a search for Voldemort's horcruxes also turns into a hunt for the three mysterious Deathly Hallows, along with a struggle for survival.<br /><br />This is a very dark and intense film, and rightfully so, as the seventh book in the HP series is the most grim of all. The filmmakers got a lot of things right, but there were a few disappointments. (Note: a few spoilers are ahead.) I understand the need to omit material from movies to meet time requirements, and I even understand the desire to make small alterations so certain things translate better from page to screen. However, changing things just for the sake of changing them really irritates me. One thing that really disappointed me was the sequence where Harry is taken away from the Dursley residence, and a bunch of Harry Potters undergo an airborne attack by Death Eaters. That scene was way too short in the film, and for some reason half of it took place in the middle of a busy London street, which made no sense at all. Hedwig's death was also rewritten a bit, and in my opinion it happened way too fast and didn't do the poor owl justice. (At least the Dobby death scene was much better.)<br /><br />I also wasn't happy that the film added some scenes that weren't in the book at all. This takes away from an opportunity to showcase more of the original plot from the novel. Why, for instance, include that stupid scene with Harry and Hermione dancing in the tent and cut the Harry/Lupin fight that occurs in Grimmauld Place? Most of the scenes that were new to the movie easily could have been omitted in favor of Rowling's original material.<br /><br />In spite of those shortcomings, however. this is truly an excellent film. It was made for fans of the books, so critics who blast the film for being too long and dragging in the beginning obviously have no idea what they're talking about. The cast is amazing, the effects are phenomenal, and you REALLY need to see this movie in the theatre. I cannot wait to see the final movie next spring.</p></body></html>

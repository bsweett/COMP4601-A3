<meta name="summary" content="A Wonderful Movie!"></head><body><p>Have you ever watched a movie and thought that was better than I ever imagined it would be. Well, although I have enjoyed a few Singleton flicks, I did not expect to enjoy this one as much as I did.<br /><br />The Mercer brothers return to their hometown of Detroit to bury a woman who loved them like they were her own. All four men, now brothers, were adopted by a woman, who did not care that they were different races with torrid pasts, but who loved them regardless of what they did.  She instilled different traits in each of them in an effort to make them successful in life. Although, according to Terrance Howard's character, they were the only four kids that she could not "save" or find homes for. Anyway, these brothers are thrust together by their mother's death, and an investigation into who killed her and why. As they embark on a quest to find the truth they learn alot about themselves and grow closer. Through a series of conversations, we learn a lot about each character, and we see each of them fight their own demons, and navigate through self awareness as they solve the crime. We find that the love that they have for each is more than if they were blood brothers.<br /><br />This story will make you laugh (there are some funny moments) and cry (one brother dies), but the entire story will make you smile. The real journey is the one that begins when your heart allows you to love unconditionally, and that is the true point of the movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Where did you get those eyes?"></head><body><p>Two Siblings returning home from college witness a man throwing bodies down a drainage pipe at the back of an old church and in an act of absolute stupidity, they decide to investigate. They discover hundreds of perfectly preserved bodies all stitched up and artistically spread out throughout the dusty, dark cellar. Their nosiness fuels the wrath of the killer who isn't a man at all but some sort of monstrous, murderous demon who has risen from the depths of the earth to feed on human flesh.<br /><br />I must frankly state that it was very difficult for me to feel sorry for the two main charaters. Although they were both youthful, attractive and very likable, it was their foolishness that got them in trouble in the first place. I am no expert in profiling but the film still begs me to ask the question: What part of the man's appearance had they not mistaken for a vicious killer? He was only about 10 feet tall, was wearing a freakish, dusty, moth worn hat, a Jack The Ripper-ish over coat and was clearly dumping bodies (most likely dead bodies) into a drainage pipe. And let's not forget his mode of transportation and really bad driving skills.<br /><br />"Jeepers Creepers" is still one of the most innovative horror film in a long time. It has some good performances and a very mysterious killer.  Although the film follows the typical slasher movie formula, it rises above them due to it's enigmatic and supernatural storyline. Also, the origins of the killer is never really explained and the killer's face is not clearly shown until the final frames all adding a sense of mystery, intrigue and fear. Add in some scenes of explicit gore, slaughter, and a  surprise ending and you have an enjoyable, eerie tale of human idiocy, bloodshed and tears. Oh and who can forget that song?<br /><br />"Jeepers Creepers...Where did you get those eyes?"<br /><br />There are worst ways to spend 90 minutes of your life.  Recommended.  3.5 out of 5.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="WATCH THE ORIGINAL"></head><body><p>In comparison to the original about the only thing going for this one are the special effects.  There were some plot holes in the tale and story pieces didn't connect well. I'd watch the original and skip this one unless you are totally into Greek Mythology or need an excuse for a blood and guts picture because there are a lot of blood and guts scenes.  WHEN WATCHED: 9/16/2010; MY GRADE: C plus (B minus if you fit the two categories listed).</p></body></html>

I liked Predator 1 and 2 more than the AVP sequel, however the AVPs were still great to watch.<br /><br />AVPR is different from AVP because this time Predator is fighting against an Alien that mutated into something between the Alien type and the Predator one. He's something in between! He's also stronger than the regular Aliens Predator used to fight against in AVP.<br /><br />The movie stayed exciting tll the end. I didn't appreciate the ending that much because the Aliens and Predator got killed very easily by humans via a nuclear bomb. But I guess that was the only way to get rid of them since Aliens were spreading all over the place.<br /><br />Anyway, I really don't wana see a new AVP movie anymore. We are tired of seeing Predator fighting against Aliens and humans getting stuck in between.<br /><br />I'd love to see a Predator Vs. Batman movie. That would be awsome!</p></body></html>

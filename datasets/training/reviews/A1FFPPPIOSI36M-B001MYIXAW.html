<meta name="summary" content="A horror movie wrapped up in an emotional drama"></head><body><p>"Let the Right One In" is a terrific little movie. It is hard to pigeonhole this as a horror movie since the "horror" aspect is secondary to it's main premise which is isolation and loneliness. The "horror" aspect is all together more startling since this is an  unconventional and unpredictable film.<br /><br />The movie is about a lonely, [practically] abandoned and physically immature kid. He's weird and get bullied a lot. Because his parents are divorced and the mother does not give him that much attention, his abuse and loneliness are all the more excasperated.<br /><br />As he hangs out at his apartment complex, which is all that he has to do, he befriends another lonely child...who just happens to be a vampire. They both are lonely yet for very different reasons. She's lonely because she is a monster. However, their mutual companionship develops a bond where each charactor sets aside or accepts any flaws of the other.<br /><br />As their relationship blossoms, so does the deadly vampirical activites of the little girl. Eventually the boy finds out about it and the vampire candidly discloses her tendencies. It does not matter to the boy since he is so hungry for companionship and acceptance. Of course as the movie proceeds so does the vampire's increasing hunger for blood. Eventually, the beast in the vampire inevitably must conflict with the innocense of the relationship.<br /><br />Once again, this is a small and subtle movie. It is hardly a big scale production. The plot relies on charactor development and emotion as opposed to action and excessive violence. Some viewers discuss the climax as though it's some, phenomenal piece of terrifying action. In reality, the ending is merely symbolic and consistent with the relationship that was created throughout the story.<br /><br />Not only is this a unique way to tell a vampire story but, also, the setting, in a nordic, snow-covered, urban landscape is quite different from the usual vampire fare.<br /><br />What makes this movie special is not the scares or gore (which there are) but rather  the very proven success in telling a very adult tale through child's eyes...a la "To Kill a Mockingbird". Vampire films are a dime a dozen but when it is told through a child's perspective it can be very creepy.<br /><br />This is a very good movie done in a unique way. On it's own, it is certainly quality film making. As compared to the "horror" genre, it's heads and tails above the ususal making this among the best vampire movies.</p></body></html>

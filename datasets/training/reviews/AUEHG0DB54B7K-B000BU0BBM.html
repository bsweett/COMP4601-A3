In particular, I found the blend of fantasy and horror and the creepy production with moving trees and the Mirror Queen were fantastic.<br /><br />The film is set in German during the Napoleonic wars and concerns Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm, con artists pulling off fake exorcisms from village to village.  The different between the brothers is that Jacob (Heath Ledger) believes in things magical and Wilhelm (Matt Damon) is a pragmatist.  The bothers and their two partners in crime have a great scam going until they are arrested by a French general (played by Jonathan Pryce) and are sent to a cursed German village where children are being mysteriously abducted to prove whether they can actually battle spirits as they claim.  In the village, they find Angelika (Lena Headley) whose sisters have been claimed by the unknown forces in the forest.  Angelike knows the forest and the evil the lives there and guides Wilhelm and Jacob to a mysterious tower that is the home of the Mirror Queen (played by Monica Bellucci).<br /><br />Like many of Terry Gilliam's films there are moments of near slap-stick comedy followed by scenes of horror or the fantastic.  Mixed into the film are hints of well-known fairy tales, such as Little Red Riding Hood and Hansel and Gretel.  One of the abducted girls is wearing a red cape and two children searching in the woods are dropping breadcrumbs.  This film is stunning for its production design and special effects.  The forest is fittingly forbidding and the story holds your attention throughout the film. I have read a review that suggested that the film was difficult to follow but neither I nor my wife had any such difficulties. Matt Damon makes a good Wilhelm Grimm but Heath Ledger is a passionate Jacob as he makes his case for believing in magic and that the curse of the woods can be lifted.  Jonathan Pryce was a slimy villain but I didn't care for his accent or the foppish way that he approached his role. Lean Headley was good as the determined Angelika.  If you like fantasy films and Terry Gilliam in particular, then you should see The Brothers Grimm.</p></body></html>

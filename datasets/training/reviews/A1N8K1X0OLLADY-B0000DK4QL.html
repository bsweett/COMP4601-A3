<meta name="summary" content="Waaaay better than Spiderman!!!"></head><body><p>Because that pretty boy Ben Affleck was choosen to be the star character, I had honestly expected this movie to suck. Fortunately, after watching it, it turned out to be a great movie.<p>The acting is well done, with a very heartbreaking storyline. Daredevil does many stunning airial acrobatic moves. This has everything that I had expected to see in the Spiderman movie (a movie which I hated).<p>Daredevil is a true Marvel classic. It really is better that Spiderman.</p></body></html>

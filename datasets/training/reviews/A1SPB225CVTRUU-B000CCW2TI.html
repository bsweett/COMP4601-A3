<meta name="summary" content="A Romantic Comedy turned Suspense Thriller."></head><body><p>I was misled by the trailer that this film was going to be a horror film since it's Wes Craven's work, but it turned out to be more like Before Sunrise meets Flight Plan. Considered that Red Eye doesn't have star powers like Jodie Foster and Peter Sarsgaard, it still managed to be a pretty watchable thriller. Yes, I must admit that I am glad to see Canadian darling actress Rachel McAdams rising beyond her Mean Girls images and playing some heavy-duty emotional and physical scenes opposite Cillian Murphy, the ultimate villian player these days. Murphy is very convincing as the evil and vicious hyjacker. McAdams is very good playing her role which goes from totally confident and in control to becoming terrified and vulnerable. Brian Cox is rather wasted with insignificant role and underexposed as McAdams' father. There's limited amount of special effects and action taken place during this film and it's the headgames between the two leads that makes this film more worthwhile, but the ending is the part that failed to satisfy.</p></body></html>

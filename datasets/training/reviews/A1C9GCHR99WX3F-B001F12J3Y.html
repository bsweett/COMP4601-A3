And if you are a big Tom Hanks fan, then this should really get you happy, he is cast in 5 roles in the movie, so there wouldb't be to many scenes without Tom Hanks. The movie also has the voices of Jimmy Bennett, Eddie Deezen, and the late Michael Jeter. The movie set up is this, on Christmas Eve a train stops in front of boys and girl's house that cause trouble, or start doubting the existance of Santa Claus (Tom Hanks) and takes them to the North Pole to meet Santa, and he picks one child to get the first present. So it is the night of Christmas Eve, a tain pulls up the hero Boy's (Tom Hanks again) house, the train's Conductor gets out to greet him, and every child's house they stop, the boy asks to where, and the Conductor says the North Pole, of course the boy doesn't want to get on, but changes his mind in time before he leaves his house. On the train is other children including Hero Girl (Nona Gaye, daughter of the late singer Marvin Gaye). The conductor takes the children's ticket, which somehow magical appears. But forgets about the hero girl, but when Hero Boy discovers the ticket, the boy loses the ticket, and the conductor takes the girl away.</p></body></html>

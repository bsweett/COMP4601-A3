<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Comedy that is Truly Uplifiting"></head><body><p>This movie is probably one of my favorite movies of all time. The tone of the movie is set so right with Bill Murray as Phil. He is in his element. The movie is hilarious, but Phil does a great job of reenacting his days over and over and over again. This movie was released a long time ago, but the dvd sales rank is 431. That is still pretty high considering how old this movie is. <p>The real thing that catches my interest with this film is the way it conveys drama, yet is uplifting. Although Phil runs into some tear-jerker moments that make you feel sad, the movie truly uplifts your heart in the end and makes you feel great. I have seen countless movies that were dramas, and they left me feeling depressed. I really love how Phil starts to realize that you have to make the best of things.<p>The movie is really great. I can't understand why this movie would receive a negative review. Each day is truly interesting considering you have seen it, but Phil changes his routines, and changes a great deal over the course of the film. 5 stars. I recommend this movie to anyone who just wants to feel good.</p></body></html>

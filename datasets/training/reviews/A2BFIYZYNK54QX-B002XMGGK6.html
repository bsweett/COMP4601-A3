<meta name="summary" content="Some interesting moments, but falls too far too fast."></head><body><p>LAW ABIDING CITIZEN is another film that follows the long-standing trend of how ineffective our justice system is and how people find it necessary to take the law into their own hands. The last few years, we've seen this a lot with films like THE BRAVE ONE and DEATH SENTENCE. The problem that these films usually face is they treat it either too realistically, or not realistically enough. In the case of LAW ABIDING CITIZEN, it's starts one way and then falls way too far in the other direction.<br /><br />The opening is very realistic and very brutal with the home invasion sequence and the preliminaries to the action, as Foxx does his legal dealings with the devil and Butler deals with the anger and frustration of watching the real killer of his family get a lesser sentence, and it does show promise for the remainder of the film. But once Butler's plan goes into motion, that's when the film really starts to go off the rails. Butler, who is an actor that I really admire, gets to have a lot of fun with this role, but it's not a role that he should be having fun with. His character turns inexplicably from vengeance-seeking father and husband to evil genius in a very short period of screen time. And Foxx's character is so unbearably cocky and smarmy that it's very difficult to root for him, even when Butler's character has done some really evil stuff. And the fact that Butler's character is so much more than he seems to be... it's just a horrible deus ex machina and it's a really hacky premise. He can't just be a normal angry man; he has to be a former government assassin.<br /><br />If they decided to make Butler the hero of this film and maybe give the film a PUNISHER-like angle where the people that he's killing are truly corrupt and evil, and Foxx's character was maybe someone who was caught in the middle of all this insanity... Well, that is a film that would make for a more entertaining and satisfying watch. Alas, they took another road, and it's a road that starts in a world of plausibility and forks off so far into ridiculousness that the film ultimately implodes on itself.<br /><br />F. Gary Gray isn't known much for his thought-provoking films, and is much more of the fast-paced, blow-stuff-up school. THE NEGOTIATOR with Sam Jackson and Kevin Spacey is as close as he's gotten to making a very watchable film, and unfortunately, Butler and Foxx are not Spacey and Jackson.<br /><br />The worst thing about this film is that it really doesn't even seem to have a point. It's just a good premise turned into a bad film.</p></body></html>

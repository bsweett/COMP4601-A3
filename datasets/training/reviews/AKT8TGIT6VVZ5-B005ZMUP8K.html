I haven't had as much fun spending more than two and a half hours watching a film since seeing the last of Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" films or the first "Pirates of the Caribbean" film. Although this installment of "Pirates of the Caribbean" is much darker in tone than its predecessor, this is one film which virtually anyone between the ages of 5 through 105 shall enjoy with ample surprise and pleasure, in store for those fortunate to see it. Admittedly, "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" isn't quite the perfect sequel, since the film itself could have used at least ten minutes of editing, most notably in a brilliantly staged scene set on a rolling mill wheel in which three of our protagonists, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), and former Royal Navy Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport) engage in a memorable - if a bit long - menage a trois of a fierce swordfight. But I strongly recommend "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" for both its fast-paced action and the splendid acting from its talented cast.<br /><br />I'm not exaggerating when I think the acting in "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" is better than its illustrious predecessor, "Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl". Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow comes across as a bizarre 18th Century version of Mick Jagger; funnier, with perhaps a bit more than a touch of insanity, than in the first "Pirates of the Caribbean" film. Some of his most memorable scenes are performed opposite Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Swann, who shows she can hold her own against Depp as a dashing heroine to the rescue. Jack Davenport's Norrington is even more memorable than his portrayal in the first film; this time offering a moodier, darker portrayal, that reminds me of Pierce Brosnan's James Bond, since Norrington is now down on his luck, as a former Royal Navy commodore, with no choice but to join his erstwhile enemy Jack Sparrow as a new crewman of Sparrow's pirate ship Black Pearl. And Orlando Bloom is quite convincing too as the young Will Turner, offering a performance as memorable as his Legolas in Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" films. Stellan Skarsg?rd offers yet another mesmerizing performance as Bootstrap Bill, Will's enslaved father, trapped as a crewman aboard the phantom ship Flying Dutchman. Kevin McNally turns in another fine performance as Gibbs, Jack's first mate aboard the Black Pearl. So does Jonathan Pryce once more as Governor Weatherby Swann, Elizabeth's father. Last, but not least, Naomie Harris is excellent too as the mysterious Caribbean vodou priestess Tia Dalma, during her all too brief moments on screen.<br /><br />In "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest", Captain Jack Sparrow must take his ship Black Pearl on an epic quest in search of Davy Jones's chest, after receiving an  unexpected visit from Bootstrap Bill, in a Ghost of Christmas Eve-like appearance,  warning Jack that Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) seeks his soul now, as payment for a Faustian bargain struck between Jack and Davy Jones thirteen years ago. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) are forced to postpone their wedding, finding themselves under arrest for aiding and abetting Jack Sparrow's escape (which was depicted in the previous "Pirates of the Caribbean" film). So the stage is set for a memorable series of encounters with Davy Jones and his favorite beastie, the deadly Kraken, and, at the film's end as a surprise, an unexpected appearance of a leading protagonist from the first "Pirates of the Caribbean" film. Director Gore Verbinski does an admirable job in steering his cast and crew through the cinematic mayhem which follows, offering riveting excitement for most of the film's length. Now I am eagerly awaiting the final chapter in this rousing cinematic trilogy, which is due out next spring in May 2007, but I have no doubt that I shall see this film again, long before its sequel arrives in theaters next year.</p></body></html>

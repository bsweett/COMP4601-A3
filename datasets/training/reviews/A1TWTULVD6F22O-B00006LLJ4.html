It gives Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg a chance to work together, and to redeem themselves after a few missteps.  Cruise, a box office draw in the manner of Tom Hanks, and Harrison Ford,  really needed a winning film after a couple of mistakes with excellent directors  (Cameron Crowe's "Vanilla Sky" and Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut"). I feel he wants the success right now not only financially and artistically, but perhaps to keep up with the superior acting skills of Ms. Kidman.  Because of his appeal, Cruise gets his choice of directors.  Spielberg had been toying with the idea of bringing the science fiction short story of author Philip K. Dick to film, and I think I understand that Cruise added character motivation by supporting the plotline with the addition of a kidnapped child for the main character, a child that colors his decision-making process for the rest of his life.  The loss of this child and his marriage gives Cruise the empathy and humane qualities he needs to deal with Agatha (one of the PreCrime unit's "pre-cogs", see below).The combination of Cruise's confident turn as John Anderton, a detective in the year 2054, and Spielberg's vision and special effects to give the film a chilling landscape of what the future holds.<p>In the future, the problem of wanton homicide has been solved in Washington D.C.  by the creation of a "PreCrime" division.  PreCrime uses a complicated mental/visual process to identify murders before they occur, and give the detectives enough time to locate the scene of the upcoming crime and stop the murder.  As a result of this strategy, premeditated murder almost never happens in D.C., and the unit has managed to stop all the murders that would have occurred due to "crimes of passion" by their quick diagnosis and high-tech tools that deliver them to the site of the crime, in time to stop it.  The film opens with a demonstration of the technique that is so well done, fearlessly led by Cruise, that viewers have few questions of the complicated mechanisms of the process.  How do the murders get predicted?  Mysteriously, three humans with highly trained precognitive powers (The "Pre-cogs"), join mental forces to project and even act out the crimes.  How the criminal justice system handles the pre-cogs, and how it handles the criminals convicted of "premurder" is the most chilling part of the movie.  The viewer is drawn inescapably into a plot to frame Anderton himself for a future murder of a man he doesn't even know. The investigation of his own crime will draw you in and keep you paranoid about the action and the outcome until the film concludes. <p>Cruise is perfect for this film - a film chameleon; he gives us an action hero that is believable and empathetic.  He's not trying for an Oscar here, in this action adventure flick; he's just making the movie work.  His flawed and grieving character is really the only well developed of the movie's many roles - Spielberg correctly lets the astonishing special effects drive the film.  Spielberg also has been seeking redemption.  His "Artificial Intelligence" was a huge disappointment.  Paired with cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (who will probably win an Oscar), with whom he has worked successfully in recent years, Spielberg gives us special effects worthy of the Indiana Jones series.  <p> Colin Farrell plays the FBI agent who is Anderton's nemesis (a role originally planned for Matt Damon, who would have been more successful).  The incredible career of Max Von Sydow continues as he has his biggest and best role on the big screen in years.  Von Sydow has, of late, turned to cable television to find the haughty, regal and demanding roles for which he is known ("Citizen X" on HBO, "Solomon", and his turn as a humble Jew in "Nuremburg").  Prior to those, he was appearing with frequency on the big screen but in sleepers like "Druids", the Eurohorror flick, "Sleepless", and the endless "Snow Falling on Cedars".  Von Sydow is impeccable in the role of Anderton's mentor, Director Burgess.  His passion for the PreCrime experiment is exceeded only by Anderton's own passion.  Steve Harris ("The Practice"), Daniel London and Samantha Morton are notable, but perhaps my favorite character role went to Lois Smith, a crusty genius with a greenhouse that will make you lose sleep. You've seen Smith everywhere, and just didn't know it (Helen Hunt's Aunt Meg in Twister, Susan Sarandon's mother in "Dead Man Walking", to name two). Her character, Dr. Iris Hineman, helped Burgess create PreCrime, and it is she who gives Anderton the clue needed to deal with his impending doom.  A  movie that will really hold your interest, potentially a boxoffice and DVD smash!</p></body></html>

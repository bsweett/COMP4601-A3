If you're not sure if this one qualifies, I'll say this -- I, a fan of the first two flicks, went to this movie with a friend who had never seen any of the Resident Evil films and who wasn't intrigued in the least by any descriptions of them.  "I fully expect to fall asleep," was her response when we bought the tickets.<br /><br />Turns out, she enjoyed the film.  I did not.  That should tell you something right there.<br /><br />For those of you, like my friend, who don't know the Resident Evil mythos, a recap:<br /><br />THE FIRST MOVIE:  Umbrella Corporation.  Owns everything.  Run by men hungry for both power and money.  But mostly power.  They develop something called a T-Virus, designed initially as a biological weapon.  It turns people into zombies.  Whoops.  It gets loose in their top-secret research facility.  Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up, confused and mostly naked.  After gaining her senses and enough clothes to be reasonably decent (by gamer standards) she leads a team of security personnel in an attempt to gather up the survivors and any possible information that may lead to a cure for the T-Virus.  Alice makes it out of the hellhole and into the arms of Umbrella Corporation lackeys who immediately shoot her up full of drugs.  Before she can say thanks, she passes out.<br /><br />THE SECOND MOVIE:  Alice wakes up, confused and mostly naked, in a lab in Raccoon City, home of the Umbrella Corporation's top-secret research facility.  Whoops.  The virus has spread into the city.  The Umbrella Corporation has erected a large, unbreachable wall around the city, and everyone is shut inside.  The town is ordered to be nuked; they'll tell the rest of the world it was a fluke accident: someone left a fork in the microwave or something.  Alice leads a team of highly trained military personnel in an attempt to find a little girl and a way out of the very dangerous, very doomed town.  Along the way, she fights a critter named Nemesis, who is mostly made of neck.  She wins!<br /><br />THIS MOVIE:  Alice wakes up, confused and mostly naked ...<br /><br />Okay, so I like zombie movies.  There's little left in movies that really scares me anymore, but zombies almost always do the trick.  Maybe it's the metaphor of their mindless persistence.  Maybe it's the blood-soaked personification of herd mentality.  Maybe I don't like the idea of anyone or anything that operates independently of reason.  Whatever it is, since Romero first shocked the world with his Living Dead series, I've been a fan.  (And 2004's remake of "Dawn of the Dead," for my money, is the most disturbing zombie film out there.)<br /><br />But RE:E?  Well, I'm not sure what to call it.  Zombie movie?  Eh.<br /><br />Sure, the T-Virus has spread.  The whole world has been infected.  Also, guess what?  It affects the soil and the water, too, so now most of the planet is desert.  It gets in the crows, and they go all bug-eyed.  In heavy doses, it causes rapid mutation.  And Alice?  Why, she's chock full of the stuff!  But in a good way.  In the kind of way that makes her able to do things that David Blaine can only dream of.<br /><br />Although they couldn't be called good cinema, the first two films were at least reliably dependant.  Maybe it's because they adhered so closely to the games upon which they were based.  Okay, so the formula is so rigid, viewers might find themselves looking for Life Remaining bars on the screen, but at least there were solid motivations, obstacles, and some level of sense.  Yes, some.  I don't cotton to the viewers who whine when the movies depart from the game script (seems a little odd to me, to seek theatrical validation for something you've spent hours memorizing on your own at home), but I do understand how those games can be the life blood of what is essentially a brain-dead premise.  Or maybe the games, in this metaphor, would be the T-Virus.<br /><br />Nevermind.  The point is, RE:E goes nowhere, and it goes there with as much herky-jerky senselessness as its undead cast.  A convoy of survivors is wandering the North American wasteland, basically driving away the time until they die.  Alice, alone, is doing likewise.  Dr. Issacs, a scientist at the Umbrella Corporation, is still running experiments, trying to find a cure for the T-Virus.  That seems like a pretty noble task, but the script goes to great lengths to establish him as a ridiculously evil person.  When he finds out that Alice is still alive, does he simply go to her and say, "Look, hey, sorry about all of the trying to kill you stuff.  And the zombie dogs.  And the neck monster.  Heh.  Guess we got carried away.  But, hey, the cure to it all might be in your blood, actually, and I was wondering ... uh, can I borrow a drop?"  Of course he doesn't.<br /><br />This is the movie's central conflict.  You might think it's about the convoy of survivors.  You might think it's about a possibly uninfected corridor of Alaska where everyone can go to find peace.  You might even think it's about a cure, a resolution, or some kind of curtain call on the whole dismal affair.  No.  What it's really about is a fourth film.  By the final frame of "Extinction," you'll realize what I did: you just watched a two-hour prologue.  And it's not even that great of a prologue.<br /><br />If you're like my friend, maybe you'll see a kind of interesting flick with some neat fight scenes, one or two cool ESP moments, and an ending that is as canned as the food served to the convoy's dwindling members.  At least you'll see something that's better than bad, which was what my friend was expecting.<br /><br />If you're like me, with hopes a little further north, prepare to be let down.  This film is full of the false scares and sudden bangs that make up all the cheap thrills of most horror films; I'll admit I jumped a few times at the start.  But by the end, the thrills were gone, and all that was left was the cheap.  I'm not sure what this means for the next film coming.  Although I'll bet it starts with Alice waking up, confused and mostly naked.</p></body></html>

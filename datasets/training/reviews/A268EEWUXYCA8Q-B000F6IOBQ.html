<meta name="summary" content="A great sequel for fans of the original"></head><body><p>Underworld was received with blistering critical backlash.  If you were to look at a reviewing site, such as Rottentomatoes.com, you would find that approximately 30% of the critics liked it while 70% hated it.  Yet it was a hit in the theatres, and grew a fan base.  For every fan, there seems to be someone who hated it.  I really enjoyed it.  For us fans, there comes Underworld: Evolution.<br /><br />Evolution does everything a good sequel should.  It makes the action better, it continues the story, but most importantly it changes the way we see things.  A good sequel will twist what we know of the original, will introduce new things and will make us revaluate alliances etc.  And Underworld does just that.  It adds to the story and twists some things so that it becomes a different story than the previous one.<br /><br />One of the problems I had with the first was its ending.  I really enjoyed it, and the way it left room for a sequel; but it was also a bit anti-climatic.  Evolution makes up for it by creating an ending that raises the stakes and creates enough tension so that, even if you know how one of the baddies will be killed, its exciting.<br /><br />One of my complaints is the pacing in the middle.  There are times that the pacing wasn't as "moving" as in the first film.  While never boring, there were moments that were slow.<br /><br />People who hated the first film will probably not be steered to the fan side.  But, people who hated the first film shouldn't be seeing this film anyway.  And so I'm glad that Lens Wiseman didn't sell out.  He didn't make a PG-13 sequel that was luke warm in reception.  It ended up being a great sequel made by a fan for the fans.</p></body></html>

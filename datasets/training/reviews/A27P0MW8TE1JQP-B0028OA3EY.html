<meta name="summary" content="Great Caesar's Ghost!!! ...It's SWELL!!!"></head><body><p>Nearly 30 years ago we saw the rebirth of the 1938 character on screen, we had seen the black & white to color TV reruns, but until unknown Christopher Reeve flew to John Williams' music embodiment of the Superman, we believed that "a man could fly" like the tagline offered, and the film still holds up pretty well. But this "Return" after 1987's fourth and weakess offering is styled to continue the movie continuity (more post Superman II, than IV) with the original nearly invulnerable character with the same two weaknesses we all know and love: Kryptonite, of course, and those pesky human bonds, i.e. the people around him who can be used by his enemies as leverage, the very reason for his lame CK alter ego. Both of these weaknesses are exploited again and again in the films, this one too. These weaknesses are exploited by nemesis Lex Luthor, played in the spirit of Hackman's incarnation of the character here by the brilliant Kevin Spacey. This time his plan isn't any more original, just visually inspired, he plans to use Superman's Kryptonian tech to create "New Krypton" on Earth, with a Kryptonite twist. Luthor's philosophy is articulately outlined by an early scene with his latest groupie Kitty Kowaiski (Parker Posey) in which LL is asks if he considers himself a god, and he sees himself as Prometheus stealing fire from the gods to "share it" with mankind. I thought that this was a truly original view of Luthor's motivation for his hatred of Superman, not the old he's good and I'm bad, setup, but a genuine distain for this alien who's holding out on the human race.<br /><br />There was preproduction talk, about the same time the DaVinci Code was being scrutinized, about the messiah angle of SUPERMAN RETURNS; Jor-El sends his only son to Earth to lead through example, he returns to the heavens (search the remains of Krypton),  his "second coming" back to Earth and towards the climax of the film he takes a "Passion"-like beating from Luthor's thugs looking on like Roman centurians. The original character concept has always been at least a demi-god, coming to terms with his human-half like Hercules, super-strong, part-god, part-man, his greatest weakness his hubris. Jewish immigrants themselves, the original creative team, before "Supes" did more than leap over tall buildings, probably saw him as the ultimate immigration success story, not for themselves they got little over 100  bucks and a 10 yr contract for the character, but Superman was embraced by the fictitious world the same as the real world. Director Bryan Singer explores the emotional impact of a world that has moved on without Superman, a concept probably more effectively done in the various Superman comic series over the years (he has left Earth for self imposed exiles on multiple occasions, not to mention his death in 1992). The film deals with the impact on those around both Clark Kent and Superman. Lois has had a kid (who was born shortly after Superman leaves Earth, hmm...),  gotten an X-man fianc&eacute; and written a Pulitzer winning story "Why the World Doesn't Needs Superman." Sure there's loads of character exploration, that's what Singer excels at ( see Usual Suspects and X Men 1 &2), but there's also more action than you'll see anywhere else this summer, even without Richard Donner. The story could be better considering all the writers who didn't make the cut in the end (Kevin Smith, J.J. Abrams for starters). I wish they had broken away from the familiar, maybe dare I say it "left out Lex," maybe even used the "Death of Superman" storyline, including Doomsday and the "Reign of the Supermen."  WB's Smallville has proved that the character can be successful without being constrained to canon.  But this familiarity is surely a strength that makes the film feel like a long-over-due sequel. It's got the same, only darker, sense of humor as the originals. There's also an amusing anti-smoking gag that runs through the film (for example, a catatrophic sequence of events started by a cabbie's stogie, and Lois is hounded to quit by multiple parties).<br /><br />The art direction was bold, but while the suit pays homage to decades of design, it is careful not to stray to far (although the retro-reverse shield on the belt is a cool touch). Metropolis, is finally a real city now, not just a recycled New York, the Daily Planet looks great, and you just know that globe on top is gonna see some action from the opening. But as for FX, there are some milestones here, some crazy-good super-saves, I mean a bullet to the super-eye, awesome, New Krypton awesome, I wasn't sure they could top "Matrix" flight, or even "Smallville" limited airborne moments, but never has the rescue of a crashing plane  been handled with better style, believable physics and sheer coolness!<br /><br />With Singer as big a fan as he is of the original films he should have tried get John Williams to handle the whole score instead of his X-staple John Ottman. But Ottman uses enough of Williams' Superman motiffs and themes to satisfy.  And it's plenty better than the X3 music, yuck.<br /><br />On casting, the movies gotten loads of grief, partly because the part has turned over so much, but I agree with the need for a relative unknown, so you aren't distracted by a celebrity. Brandon Routh, fits the bill, he looks and sounds like Reeve, which was more the plan than getting Superman, I think. Spacey is so good in everything that he does his celebrity transcends any part he plays, Kate gives a lot of heart to the Lois character as does the great Frank Lanella playing editor Perry White. Using Brando footage as Jor-El is inspired as is the casting of Eva Marie Saint as Martha Kent. Sam Huntington plays Superman's pal Jimmy Olsen well-enough (although the guy is almost never out shooting pics), while Superman's revial for Lois' affections are played believably by James Marsden as Richard White, who at one point in a "discussion" with Lois throws her previous story title "The Night I Spent With Superman" in her face. There's a nice love triangle, but it's not the traditional Clark/Lois/Superman. There's little chemistry between Brandon as Clark and Kate as Lois, but once she overcomes her abandonment issues with Superman he becomes a player in a triangle with Lois and Richard. But, he comes to terms with his role in their lives when he asks his competition during a rescue if "he's got them." By the end we realize, as does Clark, that the world still needs a savior and a Superman. I'm glad we've got one in Superman Returns.<br /><br />There are some nice twists that may or may not keep you guessing (especially at the end) but, it is a great flick. Also it has SPIDERMAN 3 PREVIEWS!</p></body></html>

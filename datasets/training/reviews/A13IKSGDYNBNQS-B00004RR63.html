<meta name="summary" content="Quality Sci-fi"></head><body><p>A wonderful film that at its heart has a well thought out story, and for the most part does not betray the fact that it was filmed 25 years ago. I've just re-watched it for the first time in ten years and none of the elements that made it so good in the 1980's have really dated at all. Sure there are no mobile phones to assist Sarah Conner, and the stop motion photography near the end betrays the films relatively low budget, but all in all its a roller coaster ride that takes some beating.<br /><br />The first hour is relentless action with a high degree of tension as well. If by chance you've never seen it before you are really won't be sure who wants to kill Sarah Conner. Of course if you've seen T2 first you may be even more confused....<br /><br />Schwarzenegger was made for this role, and the idea of him being a cyborg with real flesh is entirely believable. If theres one criticsm of the film its perhaps that they should have dubbed a different voice (a bit like they did with Dave Prowse in Star Wars) when The Terminator speaks.<br /><br />Credit must go to James Cameron the director, who was responsible for so many quality Action/Sci-fi/Horror films in the 80's and early 90's. Sadly Cameron hasn't maintained that standard and since directing Titanic (which itself wasn't that good and was 10 years ago now) hasn't made another as good as The Terminator.</p></body></html>

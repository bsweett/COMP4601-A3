As always, along the way of enjoying Fiennes' great acting, I discover other great actors. This time with this movie, I was pleased to discover the awesome talents of Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson as two hit men in hiding. The two men are hiding in Bruges as a punishment for something that went wrong with one of their operations, and waiting for further instructions from Fiennes, their boss.<br /><br />The plot seems very simple, but the moral questions that you are left to contemplate after watching this movie is the real emotional gain or maybe the mental torture that endures.<br /><br />The guilt feelings that some people are blessed to live with or others are even more blessed to never experience are some of the emotional/moral topics explored in this movie. What is more challenging and potentially devastating is the judgment of other people over the choices or mistakes we made.  How morally justified these judges are and who made them Gods on earth to judge others. Most importantly, what is a crime and what is not? What is a sin and what is not? This is a special movie that is far deeper than most of us are willing to think. enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Probably Not What You Are Expecting..."></head><body><p>Even if the previews for this movie looked terrible and even if the movie didn't have tons of hype backing it up (stories of people getting sick and passing out in theaters) and even if it didn't have Quentin Tarantino's name plastered all over it, I still would have seen "Hostel." Why? Writer/director, Eli Roth, won me over with his first flick, "Cabin Fever," which definitely had a style all it's own and I've been dying to see what he would come up with next. Afterall, the guy's got just as sick of taste in horror as he does in humor. Needless to say, if you go into "Hostel" knowing what kind of movie you are seeing, you really won't be disappointed.<br /><br />The previews make this movie look like an extremely graphic, intense flick where people are being tortured for 90 minutes. I'll admit, I bought into it and sat down in the theater prepared to have my usually strong stomach put to the test. However, this isn't that flick. Just like "Cabin Fever" was misrepresented and therefore, misunderstood back in 2003, due to a poor advertising campaign, so is "Hostel." Judging by most negative reviews, it seems people went into it under the inlfuence of the ads, which seem to promise a bloodfest. Not to say this movie is wimpy, as it has it's share of gore, but it's not as brutal and unrelenting as it looked like. Eli Roth brings his own flavor once again to this movie, and just like Cabin Fever, it's one of those movies that you never quite know what to expect. Injected throughout are sprinkles of Roth's signature sense of humor, but unlike "Cabin Fever," the movie doesn't end in one big punchline involving rifles. The cast, led by the superb Jay Hernandez (who makes his role as human and realistic as possible) is perfect for this movie, and the European setting alone is intriguing enough to sit through this movie for, if not for the bounty of bare breasts (this movie must hold the record).<br /><br />So, when you consider the wasteland that is Winter movies ("Big Momma's  House 2," anyone?), "Hostel" is the oasis in it all. Here you will find a movie that is interesting, original, makes you think, and entertains all your senses at once. As Roth's second film, it's a winner. Obviously it has it's flaws, but such can be forgiven. As by the time you walk out the theater, you will be wondering what you would do in this situation, or if things like this really go on in the world. You've been warned: Don't go in expecting carnage. It's just a unique, slightly bent horror flick, the kind that only Eli Roth could deliver.</p></body></html>

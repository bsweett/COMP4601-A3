<meta name="summary" content="Chilling, Brilliant and Terrifying: This Ripper Has It All"></head><body><p>The Hughes Brothers have made a masterful attempt at unveiling the real identity of Jack The Ripper in &quot;From Hell&quot;.  It's a chilling tale, told with remarkable restraint, considering the film's subject matter.  Only in the final few scenes do we get the real gore-fest that we've been waiting for and when it comes it makes the hair on the back of one's neck stand on end.<br />Even more scary than the film is the BBC documentary included on disc 2 of this special edition, a revealing and haunting look into the real life murders in White Chapel with tons of documented photo archival material that will make for some pretty sleepless nights once you've seen them.  There's also a bunch of other extra material that is equally compelling and revolting.  I loved this movie for its shock value and artistry. The cast is superb.  The screenplay moves effortlessly along from one plot point to the next, creating plenty of doubt and fear in the mind of the viewer along the way.  This is film making in the grand style of the old Universal horror movies, told with a scope that surpasses anything done before and absolutely shocking to watch.  Enjoy.</p></body></html>

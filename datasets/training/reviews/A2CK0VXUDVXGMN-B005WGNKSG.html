<meta name="summary" content="Haunting, Interesting, at first, and then, the fizzle"></head><body><p>This movie kept me intrigued and satisfied as the protagonist, a investigative reporter who is facing jail for libeling a billionaire (would not happen in the US), is hired to unravel what happened to Harriet of the rich Vanger family several of whose members were infected by Nazism.  Despite strong performances by the protagonist and, the girl with the dragon tattoo, the movie lapsed into a tired cliche of finding a serial killer in a convoluted, contrived plot that left me cold. Perhaps I lost something in the translation, but the ending was doubly contrived and left me perplexed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Second Chance"></head><body><p>Ron Howard's last two movies, "A Beautiful Mind" and "Cinderella Man," are perhaps his most accomplished, and they star Russell Crowe at perhaps his most appealing. For both, Howard assembled the same filmmaking team, including the same writer. This is a boxing movie the way "Million Dollar Baby" is a boxing movie; the characters are boxers serving a larger theme. "Baby" was about a controversial social issue; "Cinderella Man" is about the real-life James Braddock boxing to feed his family during the Depression and inspiring hope among the impoverished, the way Seabiscuit at the time inspired the same people.<br /><br />It's a sentimental story, told without sentimentality, about a man given a second chance. Crowe as Braddock, Renee Zwellinger as his wife and Paul Giamatti as his manager all deliver, as do the supporting players, many of them actual boxers. The re-creation of period is spot-on, the fight sequences are choreographed closely to the real fights and photographed with exactitude, and the venues for the fights are triumphs of location and set design. In short, this movie is the real thing, really well made, and really moving.<br /><br />Crowe makes Braddock a decent man, a father devoted to his wife and kids. He learns that fighting for a cause, his family's survival, is better than fighting for fame, which he wears lightly. Giamatti, who deserves an Oscar nod, and Zwellinger (her second boxing film after "Jerry Maguire") provide skilled support. "Cinderella Man" is full of heart and hope, in a different league entirely than "Raging Bull," "The Set Up," "Body and Soul," "The Harder They Fall" and the hokey "Rocky" franchise.<br /><br />It falls short of perfect. Yet again we have a loving but whining wife who withholds support of her husband when he most needs it. Product placement reigns as every fight in every venue in every town is broadcast by NBC, its logo displayed as though no other broadcaster was there. Boxer Max Baer is depicted as the anti-Christ. But these don't distract from the ring, home and Depression sequences, which are Howard's real achievement. They establish him as a Hollywood director of the first rank.<br /><br />Quibbles about this two-disc collector's edition: it has hit-and-miss extras, three repetitive commentaries, discs difficult to extract from the case, and a lid that won't stay shut. Of the deleted scenes, the director says they are good enough for the final cut, portending a post-Oscar extended DVD (doubtless when Howard's "DaVinci Code" is out) for those of us who have just shelled out for this one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="O so slow,so slow, O Clarise wear ever did you go?"></head><body><p>I exsepted this to be simailer to Silence of the Lambs Jump right to the point!, This doesnt yes it has a lot of talking in it,, IN my opion this could go on the list of the worst sequals.  It just has Starling looking again for Dr.Lecter, after 10 years she recives a letter from him!!!<br /> Why Jodi Foster! why!!! Dont get me 1 this Clarise does good but she looks younger,,  I mean this is like 10 years later.<p> Despite what many probly think I think this should be the final moive going foward in time,, I mean I think haveing Lecter thrown back in jail would be to orgianal ending after all Lecter is a very smart guy in deed.<br />  Note to the productes: If you ever consider makeing a IV one DONT go ahead go back explane more about Dr.Lecter's past before he was thrown in jail!</p></body></html>

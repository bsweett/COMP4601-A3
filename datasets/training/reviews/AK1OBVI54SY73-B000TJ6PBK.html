<meta name="summary" content="A Success"></head><body><p>Nowadays it seems horror movies are either too tame to even be scary- and you're just eventually bored, or they are just filled with so much gore you are not scared- but just disgusted. I have grown bitter with horror films these days, but still hold on to hope at least once a year there will be one good one that comes out, which usually there is. 1408 is indeed, for me, this years one.<br /><br />It's not like it is without flaws, but the strengths in the film outweigh them. Cusack, for one, I think did just a great job with his role. Jackson was not in the movie too much so I guess he did fine with the little time he was on. The pacing and build up throughout the film I agree with the majority on, very well done. King always had a great way of building up suspense and he does not fail in this story either. He also does not fail to tug on the heartstrings as we eventually figure out why Enslin is the way he is- bitter, detached, etc.<br /><br />What I love most though is the lack of gore. I am not saying there should be none, but nowadays we are so incredibly filled to the brim with gore from so many other horror films, that watching one that really cuts back is just so refreshing. And also 1408 proves you do not need massive amounts of gore to have a movie creep you out. It's really a solid thriller throughout that at least kept me watching till the end.<br /><br />The only real problem I had in the film were the special effects. They were good enough, but I was expecting the effects to be a bit more impressive than they were. Also overall, after being a King fan for a long time, I have to admit 1408 does not measure up quite where many of King's other more heavyweight stories in the past did. Nonetheless, this is actually only a short story by King, and it really has made a successful step to film.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for a good, old- fashioned scare. King does not disappoint.<br /><br />4/5</p></body></html>

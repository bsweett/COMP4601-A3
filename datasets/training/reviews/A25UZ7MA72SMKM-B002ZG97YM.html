<meta name="summary" content="Unusual and fun movie"></head><body><p>When we initially went into the theater to see How to Raise Your Dragon, I wasn't expecting quite the story we wound up experiencing. The story we actually saw had more depth and more surprises than what I was expecting from an animated movie. I'm not going to go into the story. It is well documented. If you haven't read those reviews I don't want to be the one to provide the spoilers, but to be brief a Viking boy who is smart but a failure as a beefy warrior winds up with a different experience with the dragons his village has been at war with than his fellow villagers are having. You'll have a lot of fun as he learns to deal with his new situation, and astounds others with his new learned abilities.<br /><br />The voice performances were convincing, and the animation was just plain fun. It was a more cartoon style animation than some of the more realistically based animated movies that have been produced recently, but that was just fine. The 3D in the theater was fun, but the Blu Ray will not disappoint. Colors in this movie are rich. Some of the dragons look dragon-scary, but some of them are silly and funny. Since this is a movie primarily for kids, the silly and funny dragons are just fine.<br /><br />Highly recommended for family viewing.</p></body></html>

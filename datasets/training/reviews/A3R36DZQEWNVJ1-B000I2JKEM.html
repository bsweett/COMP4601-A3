<meta name="summary" content="a double whammy for Tim Burton and Johnny Depp this year"></head><body><p>Tim Burton's second film this year is Corpse Bride. His first film this year was his whacky version on Charlie and The Chocolate Factory in which Johnny Depp (upcoming The Libertine, Secret Window) also starred as a the insanely Willy Wonka. In Corpse Bride, Burton and his crew bring back the feel that The Nightmare Before Christmas gave and Corpse Bride hits the bullseye dead on target, enjoyble story with funny moments and some pretty decent songs. Depp voices Victor Von Dort, who is getting married to Victoria (Emily Watson, Red Dragon, Gosford Park) but here's the thing, Victoria's parents are grouchos and at the rehearsle, Victor kinda gets a little nervous, screws it up, so he takes a stroll in the woods and accidently places the ring for Victoria on a finger of a corpse...the corpse girl rises from the ground and she winds up taking Victor underground where there is other dead people. Victor must be dreaming, he wants this not to be real but he isnt imagining this, he actually proposed to his newly Corpse Bride named Emily (Helena Bonham Carter, Big Fish, Fight Club), who died years ago waiting for the one she was going to marry to come along but he never so, so she waited for him and  she wound up a corpse. So, after hearing that Victoria is marrying someone else, Victor decides he should marry Emily but in order for him to do so, he has to drink poison and die himself. So, the ghastly skeletons and deadites walk among the living for the marriage between The Corpse Bride and Victor. Anyway, that's all I'm going to tell you...I dont want to give away the whole movie but for what it was worth, Corpse Bride is bound to be another Tim Burton classic. Also starring the voices of<br /><br />Richard E. Grant (The Serpent's Kiss, Gosford Park), Albert Finney (Big Fish, Erin Brokovich), Michael Gough (Sleepy Hollow,Batman movies (except Batman Begins) and of couse the lengendary Christopher Lee (Lord Of The Rings Trilogy)</p></body></html>

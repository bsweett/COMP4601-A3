<meta name="summary" content="Fitfh Element -- First Class Blu-Ray"></head><body><p>From what I've gleaned from other reviewers, I guess I have the remastered version of "The Fifth Element" .  The picture and sound are both stunning -- better, I think, than anything I've seen on Blu-Ray.  The original DVD (non-Blu-Ray), which I also own, has a reputation for outstanding video quality and it does, but the BD is several levels better.  Some claim that the DVD is very nearly equivalent in quality to Blu-Ray and you can believe it until you have seen the remastered BD.<br /><br />As a film. this has to be the finest science-fiction comedy ever conceived.  (Yes, Space Balls is funny in places, but it's mainly for kids).  Bruce Willis and Milla Jovovich are perfect in this, Chris Rock is generally funny but gets a bit tiring before the film has ended and Gary Oldman is superb as he is in practically everything in which he has appeared.  He tends to raise the level of all of his pictures -- from "Batman Begins" to even the "Harry Potter" he appears in.  And I can't count how many pictures I've seen the superb Ian Holm appearing in, whom I didn't at first recognize.  The  same thing was true of the earlier Peter Sellers pictures.</p></body></html>

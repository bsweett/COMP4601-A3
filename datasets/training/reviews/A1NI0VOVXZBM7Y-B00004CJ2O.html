People Grew Up on this and Freddy and Halloween, Jason and Michael Are the Kings of slasher movies that spawned many imitators,Part 1 and 2 being the best of Camp Crystal Lake and actually the cabin in this one,Although Jason still has not got his "groove" on so to speak,no Mask and well no.... but the Movie is at the top not just for being part one of course.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="[4.5] A thrill ride like no other"></head><body><p>Forget what you think about Mel Gibson as a person, because either way this guy can make a movie.  The controversial "Apocalypto" is a film like no other, telling a compeling story of survival amidst extinction, using suspense and thrills that sends chills down the spine while being on the edge of your seat.  This was not the film I was expecting to see, but came away from it with a sense of power and strength, and the emotions of the will to survive.<br /><br />The first 20 minutes basically sets the Mayan village setting for us, with moments of humor (good humor at that), bonding, and family.  The dialouge is actually subtitled in English, which really is fitting for this movie.  Some of the cinematography gives you the feel of being in a Mayan jungle, and their language adds to the realism.  Once things get rolling - thus begins the roller coaster that never stops, as the Aztec (supposedly Aztec, but not necessarily) warriors make their move and all hell breaks loose, almost literally.  Powerful scenes of violence and cruelty continue constently, again adding to the realism and sickness of such an event - specifically the Aztec way of life.  The main charcatcer "Jaguar Paw" played by an impressive Rudy Youngblood, is captured (along with most of the rest of the villagers) by the Aztecs and leaves behind his pregnant wife and young son, though keeping them secretly in a safe location.  For the reminader of the movie, you know he has to get back to them and rescue them, promising them he would return.  But how can he possibly escape the fate that seems to be set in store for him and the villagers?<br /><br />The story actually is not as complex as I imagined it would have been.  This movie is basically a thriller/suspense, and doing whatever it takes to stay alive.  The only depth I really found was when a young girl speaks of a sort of prophecy.  No one wants to believe her, but the events begin coming true.  There is a good deal of insight into what life might have been like, and the sets and imagery used for the Aztec culture is shocking to an extent.  There seemed to be lots of detail, so that every aspect of this culture could be recognized.  Though its a shame to see what it represents, the great Aztec city is truly a spectacular sight, and Mel did just a fantastic job mkaing it come alive on film.<br /><br />Among the controvery associated with this film, its probably the amount of gore and violence that have people talking about the most.  From the beginning of this film to the end, you will find plenty of very disturbing scenes.  Its not really ment for entertainment purposes like a horror movie, but to give a more sense of realism.  Some scenes that really get gruesome is the eating of animal balls, hearts being torn out of bodies, beheadings, and squirting blood from a head.<br /><br />This film could also be considered action, though I wouldn't call it fun action at all.  Nevertheless, there are lots of fights and a ton of chases through the jungle.  The camera work is very impressive with these chases, with little to no shaking occuring.<br /><br />The charcaters are all convincing in this film.  The actors and actresses were chosen wisely.  Rudy Youngblood does a find job as the lead, but its the Aztec leaders that sell it the most.  Two very convincing and downright dirty villains are created, both of whom send a good dose of fear to the viewer.<br /><br />If you can deal with some disturbing scenes and lots of gore, this is a movie that everyone should see.  A great look into what might have very well been for these cultures.  It is very powerful and moving, and this movie is one you will never forget after watching.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 4.5<br />Charcaters - 5<br />Story - 4<br />Overall - 4.5</p></body></html>

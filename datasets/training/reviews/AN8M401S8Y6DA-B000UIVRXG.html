<meta name="summary" content="One if not the best sounding Hd dvd yet, bring the noise indeed!"></head><body><p>Home theater enthusiasts this could be your reference disc for sound.  I own about 40 hd dvds now and going by memory this is the best sounding one yet.  The 5.1 Dolby digital plus ex sound gives all speakers a thorough workout and  has your sub delivering tight bass for the majority of the movie.  Your receiver need not be turned up during dialogue that is also spot on and delivers crisp sound from the center channel.<br />As for the movie itself, director Edgar Wright re teams with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost along with a host of other actors from his earlier film Shaun of The Dead.  Hot Fuzz like Shaun pays homage to a genre of films, in this case the action film as opposed to horror.  However there are kills in Hot Fuzz that could rival most horror movies.  Homage is payed to the action genre, yet Hot Fuzz still creates a totally unique and creative spin all on it's own.  I like Shaun of the dead very much and I found Hot Fuzz to be more creative as there are plenty of plot twists and turns.  It is not a spoof at all and Edgar Wright takes his material seriously.  I would also mention Hot Fuzz is a great deal better than the action films it pays homage to.  Toss in a ton of laughs and this is one entertaining movie.<br />The picture quality was also dead on, i mention the sound quality so much because it was so amazing.<br />Hot Fuzz is already ranked on the internet movie database's top 250 films at number 140 currently.  It is also one of the highest reviewed films of the year earning a tomatometer of 90% out of 173 critic reviews.<br />Thanks for reading, share any thoughts.<br /><br />Hd-Dvd Bonus Features<br />-Outtakes<br />-Deleted scenes with filmmaker commentary<br />-The man who woudl be fuzz - Simon Pegg and Nick Frost act out a hilarious Hot Fuzz scene as Sean Connery and Michael Caine!<br />-Fuzz-O-Meter Select this feature and the trivia meter will run as you watch the film<br />-The fuzzball rally- U.S. tour piece-John Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright on their outrageous nationwide press tour<br />-And Many more hilarious features</p></body></html>

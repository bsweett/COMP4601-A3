<meta name="summary" content="Eagle Eye = Skynet"></head><body><p>Every single aspect of Eagle Eye has been done before, and better.  Aside from that FACT, the rest of it is just convoluted eye candy meant to put the majority of easily persuaded viewers into a trance.  Last but not least, it's a message movie, with an obvious political axe to grind from a Hollywood crowd bereft of any leverage in the moral landscape.<br /><br />Essentially, Eagle Eye is a top secret government computer system meant to predict crime (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000063W29">Minority Report</a>) by using every electronic resource networked together to eavesdrop and anticipate wrong-doing.  When a complicated political assassination attempt goes awry (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012QCZ5O">Vantage Point</a>), and against the computer's calculated recommendation, Eagle Eye becomes self-aware and decides to take over (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005N5S5">The Terminator</a>).  Countless humans, including the majority of the Order of Succession, are on the most wanted list.<br /><br />Caught in the conspiracy theory (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304708793">Conspiracy Theory</a>) of government corruption, cover up, and ubiquitous clandestine sources of observation - big brother is watching (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305428115">Enemy of the State</a>) - Shia LaBeouf and Michelle Monaghan are led around on a goose chase via mysterious phone voice that knows everything (Matrix), as the story takes about 400 plot twists and turns mistakenly meant to distract and amaze the viewers (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0752264877">Ocean's Eleven</a>).  There are countless moments in the movie's "plot" in which the ridiculously intricate details that deliver Shia and Michelle throughout Chicago (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00001MXXH">Ferris Bueller's Day Off</a>) and cross-country to the Pentagon can be questioned.  The what-ifs challenging the sequences of this movie are boundless.  If even one minor detail were to change, the movie fails (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1844160815">The Butterfly Effect</a>).  And the train sequence (stolen from movies too numerous to mention) does not provide sufficient convincing that the powers behind the voice leading the duo could orchestrate new ways to force participants' hands.  Sooner or later makers of movies like this have to watch Tom and Jerry to realize that the 43-step mouse trap doesn't work, except in cartoons.  The only aspect of the movie that is truly believable is that Shia Lebouf, much like his character in this movie, has been led around like a puppy on a leash, choosing one bad movie after another.<br /><br />It's average, somewhat interesting, but nothing all that great.  I recommend it if you can't find anything other than infomercials on TV.</p></body></html>

I was never a huge "Star Trek" fan, but I always enjoyed watching the films.  I especially enjoyed the original casts' flicks.  TNG, although good, just wasn't the same as the original cast.  With that said, I expected "Nemesis" to be a flounder due to the negative lashing it received not only from movie critics, but Trek fans as well.  I can see where loyal fans of the series could be upset with this film.  First of all, it has a heavy leaning towards action.  I always felt that TNG was quicker to try peace talks instead of phasers to solve a problem.  Secondly, fan favorites such as Riker, Worf, and Geordi were given the second-tier treatment in order for the focus to be placed firmly on Picard.  Even Data, though he has a crucial role in this film, doesn't get to really shine until the movie is about halfway to completion.<br /><br />The story, in my opinion, was wonderful.  **SPOILERS** A Romulan project gone bad, Shinzon (Tom Hardy), overthrows the Romulan Senate and almost single-handedly destroys the Federation by utilizing the warrior race Remens.  He also plays with the Remens' emotions by using the prejudices of the Romulans toward them as a weapon.  Not to mention the fact that this guy is a clone of Picard.  That alone makes for wonderful mind games between the pair.  Shinzon uses Picards mind and heart against him, trapping him with B-4, a prototype of Data, and then playing to his heart by telling him about the cruelties he suffered as a Romulan slave.  I actually felt a little sorry for Shinzon even though I knew he was the big baddie from the beginning.<br /><br />This movie plays well to a general sci-fi audience.  Hardcore TNG fans will definitely find a lot wrong with this film.  When all is said and done, however, we get a nice space action yarn that will appeal to most people in the long run.<br /><br />The DVD is very nice.  It comes with a plethora of special features, broken down into movie, Federation, and Romulan sections.  It's a nice edition to any sci-fi fan's DVD library and a necessity to any "Star Trek" completionist.</p></body></html>

I hate false advertising!<br /><br />After the initial escape scene, it's loooooooooooong, lingering shots for most of the movie, interspersed with short bits of action, some of which is so badly filmed so that you can't see what's happening. It's obvious that they're stretching it to justify two movies. They should have just made two 1.5-hour or 2-hour movies instead of subjecting us to these tediously boring stretches.<br /><br />My friends told me it was that way in the book, but slavishly following the book does not make for good filmmaking.<br /><br />There's a wedding scene that doesn't make any sense at all. Voldemort and company are scouring the world for Harry, and they throw a big wedding party? Want to attract attention much?<br /><br />And the super wand is hidden in a place that is all too easy to access ... I don't remember the upcoming plot, but I'll have to assume that Dumbledore *wanted* Voldemort to get his mitts on it, for some reason.<br /><br />There is a somewhat racy scene I'm not sure I'd want kids seeing - suggestive of Harry and Hermione embracing nude. It seemed unhealthy for all concerned, in a "kid's" movie.<br /><br />Very touching scene with a CGI elf, though.</p></body></html>

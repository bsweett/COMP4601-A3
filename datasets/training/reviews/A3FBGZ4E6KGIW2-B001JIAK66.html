<meta name="summary" content="Van Helsing."></head><body><p>Since my viewing of Underworld, I thought Van Helsing was going to stink just as bad as that did.  I was able to stay awake and actually watch Van Helsing.  I thought it was okay.  There were things that I liked and things that I disliked.  At least there's a chance of me viewing this again.</p></body></html>

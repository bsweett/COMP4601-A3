<meta name="summary" content="A love letter to music(and a good film too)"></head><body><p>Inspired by Cameron Crowe's real-life journeys and writings of some of rock and roll's biggest names(at least during the 70's anyways), the film is a kind of autobiographical-but-sort of telling of a boy becoming a man in probably the most un-innocent way a boy can.<br /><br />William Miller is an aspiring journalist who writes for some magazines, notably Creem. He meets Lester Bangs, a legendary critic/journalist who warns him of rock stars. He gives him an assignment to do a writing on a Black Sabbath concert and get an interview but he's not allowed backstage. Until up-and-coming band Stillwater decides to bring him in. He becomes so well-liked that Rolling Stone offers to send him on tour with the band and do a piece on them. And so the journey begins.<br /><br />With a largely 60's-70's soundtrack and many classic scenes, it's kind of hard not to like the film. The director's cut fleshes things out even more with more development into the characters, in particular band aid(don't call her a groupie) Penny Lane.<br /><br />While Kate Hudson is a nice find(not to mention cute), it's Billy Crudup to me who makes the better performance. Flawed, funny, and weirdly likable. Patrick Fugit is good in some scenes but other scenes it's almost like he didn't go further than he could've. Phillip Seymour Hoffman also gives a great performance as Lester Bangs, an actual journalist.<br /><br />Personally on a given day, I still prefer Jerry Maguire but this is probably Cameron's 2nd best film, even though it's obviously his most personal.</p></body></html>

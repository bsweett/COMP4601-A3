<meta name="summary" content="A Smile on My Face!"></head><body><p>&quot;Singing in the Rain&quot; is a moment of pure joy captured on film.  I can never get over the look on Gene Kelly's face when he sings that classic line.  It make me smile along with him everytime.<p>This has got to be one of the happiest movies I have seen.  Not silly or funny or goofy (well, there is a little bit of that), but just plain happy.  Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds are excellent as three chums hatching a plan.  These three conspirators want to save the silent movie dud &quot;The Dueling Cavalier&quot; by changing it into a musical.  The roadblock to their success is the spoiled starlet, Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen, nominated for Best Supporting Actress for this role) who's squeaky voice and lack of talent are set to tank the picture.<p>The plot, while fun, takes second place to the astounding musical numbers.  &quot;Good Morning, Good Mo-r-ning, We've talked the whole night though, Good Morning, Good Morning to you.&quot; (one of my favorites).  &quot;Make 'em Laugh&quot; does just that, with Donald O'Connor strutting his vaudeville stuff.  &quot;Broadway Melody&quot;  (also known as &quot;Gotta Dance&quot;) is a mesmerizing duet with Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse .  That particular piece is studied in dance history courses and considered a major work of American dance.<p>But at the end, it all comes down to &quot;Singing in the Rain.&quot;  What a wonderful thing, watching Gene Kelly splashing around in the puddles.  Happiness caught on film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Aliens Are Bad!"></head><body><p>Independence Day was a film made by the same filmmakers of the films Godzilla and Stargate and stands on its own as a science fiction modern day classic. Dean Devlin and Roland Emerich have made a few Sci-Fi adventures but this one is my favorite.<p>With a star studded cast and some great character roles, Will Smith, Bill Pulman, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Firestein, Mary McDonnell, Judd Hirsh, Harry Connick Jr., Randy Quaid, Robert Loggia, Vivica A. Fox and Brent Spinner, all shinned.<p>The effects were really outstanding and the destruction of the White House became the signature add campaign for the movie. The aliens were creepy and cool. The space ships were strange but believable. The score was even memorable.<p>Overall it is a fun film to watch and enjoy. The DVD extras include a very clever menu system and many behind the scenes looks at aliens, make-up, special effects and production. You should find the extras just as interesting as the feature itself.</p></body></html>

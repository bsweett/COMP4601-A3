<meta name="summary" content="Girl On The Side"></head><body><p>An absolute tour de force by writer/director David Mamet, SPARTAN has a kind of bubbling undercurrent that pulls the viewer back into the story just when you think it's starting to slow down.  Val Kilmer does an extraordinary turn as a former Marine turned Secret Service performing his country's highest service -- recovering the President's kidnapped daughter -- in an abduction scheme that takes several surprising turns before it's all over.  Along for the ride are William H. Macy (terribly underused but nonetheless effective) and Ed O'Neill in a terrifically understated performance as the head of the Secret Service.<p>The plot will keep you guessing, right up until the very end, but SPARTAN proves to be a warrior worthy of its name.</p></body></html>

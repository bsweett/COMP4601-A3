"Good Evening, Inspector.""></head><body><p>I just finished watching this film online and it's one of the best I've ever seen. I saw the theatrical version last week, but the Unrated version is much better. SPOILERS!!! I just wish the film had shown Hannibal killing the bully and Grentz, along with a close-up of him severing Paul Momond's head and I wish the camera hadn't cut away when the guy's throat explodes. I haven't read the novels by Thomas Harris, so I can't compare them, but the film is awesome. The performances here are just delectable, especially Gaspard Ulliel as Hannibal. I can't wait to see Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter in "Red Dragon" (I've decided to see the films in chronological order). I don't know why it's classified a a horror film. It should be termed a suspense thriller. Revenge is a dish best served cold. "Good evening, Inspector." Unrated. Should've been rated PG-13 for some violence and mild language.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent, but somewhat wasted psychology of terror."></head><body><p>`Saw II', directed and co-authored by Darren Lynn Boosman probably surprised many by being very successful in the theatre last year, although the original movie in this series was both critically and commercially a bit more successful than the average low budget horror flick, even without a big name such as George Romero or Wes Craven behind the writing and the camera.<br /><br />I was moderately impressed with the original and I believe this second installment succeeds in being as modestly good as the original, while being just original enough to be interesting in its own right.<br /><br />The most facinating thing about this story and the way it plays out is that it gives a new look at how emotional, bordering on sheer stupidity, people can be when they are faced with a horrific situation. The classic example of this blindness of rationality is when Jamie Lee Curtis retreats into a basement as she is running away from Michael Myers in Halloween (I). Reason would tell one to not let yourself be backed into a corner. The situation in Saw II is a bit different in that the victims, like the crew of the Nostromo in `Alien' are already trapped in a seemingly inescapable enclosure. The problem is not physical escape, but in solving a puzzle which requires the cooperation of the seven prisoners.<br /><br />Business trainers hammer constantly on the importance of teamwork in accomplishing things. We are not born with this intuition and if we never played a team sport, we may never have encountered this principle in either our mathematics or Shakespeare or French classes in college. The seven prisoners presented with this puzzle don't need management training to tell them they need to cooperate. Their captor, `Jigsaw', tells them straight away that the solution for their escape depends on cooperation in the two hours they have before the poison gas to which they are exposed does its worst. Over the course of the next 90 minutes, most of the seven die off largely through stupidity fuelled by terror plus selfishness. The failure of the imprisoned principles to have reason overcome fear and greed is one of the two most interesting aspects of the movie. The second, similar theme is the stupidity of the police, primarily of the principle character played by Donnie Wahlberg, to pay attention to what the perp is saying in order to solve his puzzles.<br /><br />Much credit has to be given to the several horrific traps and tortures to which the perp puts his victims. Compared to some of these perils, Jason's ax and Michael Myers' chef's knife are not much more than deadly kitty toys. Aside from the ingenious conceptions by the writers, there is the excellent realization of these deadly devices in safe Hollywood simulacra. There is not a single clue that what looks like the inevitable mayhem created by the meeting of sharp stainless steel with unprotected flesh is actually done with plastic and cosmetic appliances. While the director's commentary makes it clear that this movie was done on a relatively small budget, it seems like the writers, the director, and the editor, put too much effort into whiz-bang collages with rapidly shifting camera angles rather than dwelling on careful closeups showing the realization of peril on faces rather than spending time on screams and blood.<br /><br />While the puzzles, the perils, the booby traps, and the threat of time running out are the movie's strong points, along with the audience's frustration with the blindness of reason shown by the vics, the greatest weakness is that the perp's motives are never resolved or even fully explained. Although the principle character is a despicable person, there is no reason why the perp takes it upon himself to rain vengence down on his shoulders, especially by putting the lead character's (relatively) innocent son at risk.<br /><br />Overall, the story line in this sequel is richer and psychologically more interesting than the first, but both are a bit weak on story.<br /><br />If you like horror movies, you will certainly like this one. Most of the extras are relatively ordinary, with the most interesting being the revelations of how the special effects teams made plastic and foam and fiber optic cable look like hardwood and iron and stainless steel. My favorite extra, the director's commentary almost totally ignores the psychologically interesting aspects of the story and spends all its time dwelling on the problems of shooting and the skill of the actors in certain situations.<br /><br />More interesting than the average bloodfest, with grounds for looking forward to `Saw III'.</p></body></html>

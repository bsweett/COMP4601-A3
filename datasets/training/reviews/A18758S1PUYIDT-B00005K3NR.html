<meta name="summary" content="still chilling after 30 years"></head><body><p>This movie came out 30 or so years ago but it is still just as chilling in many ways.  Consider Carrie's tragic life, the mean girl bullies at her high school, her rude English teacher, her religious fanatic of a mother. This would be enough to destroy anyone.  Carrie, however, possesses telekinetic powers which eventually enable her to wreak the ultimate revenge on those who tormented and humiliated her.  She even ends up killing her own mother and causing their house to collapse on them, killing both.<br />Sissy Spacek has always been an outstanding actress, and this is only one example of how good she is.  You have to feel for Carrie; she has so much against her.  Piper Laurie is over-the-top-wonderful as Margaret White, who finds no joy in her religion but plenty of ways to condemn others, even her own daughter, whom she refers to as a witch because of her powers.  PJ Soles, Nancy Allen, and John Travolta are deliciously nasty as those who wish harm towards Carrie; while Amy Irving plays a teen who feel bad about picking on Carrie and tries to make it up to her.  William Katt sweetly plays Tommy, a kindly boy who agrees to take Carrie to the ill-fated prom at Sue's request.  Betty Buckley is unforgettable, too, as gym teacher Miss Collins, who tries to help Carrie with her self-image but ends up killed along with everyone else when Carrie goes into a trance during her final rage.</p></body></html>

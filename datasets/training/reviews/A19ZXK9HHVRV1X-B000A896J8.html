Although set in the late 12th Century, the film has a great deal of relevance to the world of today, seeing as how the Christian West and the Muslim East are once again at each others' throats much as they were back then.  Only the names and the weaponry seem to have changed.  With an eye towards fairness, perhaps, the movie makes it very clear that there are men of war and men of peace on both sides of the conflict, although, if the truth be told, the Christians come out slightly less noble than their Islamic counterparts in the film.<br /><br />By the time the story begins, the Crusades have been waging on and off for nearly a hundred years already.  And although a fragile peace seems to have taken a temporary hold in the Christian-ruled city of Jerusalem, forces from both without and within are threatening to rend the tender garment holding that peace together.  Orlando Bloom plays the young blacksmith, Balian, son of the beloved Sir Godfrey (Liam Nissan), who is hoping to find his redemption for killing a priest by becoming a knight and dedicating his life to defending that holiest of cities to the best of his abilities.<br /><br />Beyond its rather excessive running time, the biggest weakness in the film is Bloom himself who makes for a very bland, very pallid central figure, one whose "romance" with Sibylla, the queen of Jerusalem, is the least interesting aspect of the film.  However, there are fine compensatory supporting performances by Liam Nissan, Jeremy Irons and Ghassan Massoud as the great Islamic leader, Saladin, who, like Balian, is portrayed as almost a reluctant warrior in this titanic struggle for religious domination.<br /><br />And indeed, it is the sociopolitical parallels that the film draws between its own time and ours that ultimately lifts "Kingdom of Heaven" a rung or two above the ordinary.</p></body></html>

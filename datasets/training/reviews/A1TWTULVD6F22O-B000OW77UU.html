I would recommend it heartily to be seen in the theater, and not to wait for the DVD.<br /><br />It is formulaic, there is little suspense, and director Gabriele Muccino makes sure that you understand not only the happy ending, but the hardship.  The chemistry between Will Smith and his son Jaden makes the film work, and both Smith and Thandie Newton give performances that remind us of just how good they both are.<br /><br />While the film does not really visit the theme of how growing up black and male in America and especially in dysfunctional circumstances, (as Gardner's book did)can cause you to lose hope -- it does show us the despair and fear, leading to anger and regret, that comes of taking risks and finding yourself waking up poor.  With the right touch, the filmmakers emphasize that Gardner's willingness to pursue, really pursue, a better life for he and his son, made a difference.<br /><br />A fine film.</p></body></html>

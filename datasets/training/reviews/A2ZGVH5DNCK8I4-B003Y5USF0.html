<meta name="summary" content="A reality for everyday people, but one hell of a ride."></head><body><p>In everyday Hollywood the Tornado is only a fancy but good effect but in Oklahoma in 1999 it was a reality as in 3 years later in November when a recorded unheard of 70 twisters had<br />touched down in a midwestern town my point is that Twister is<br />a film that should have been exactly what it was and no less<br />due to respect of reality to the real people who have been<br />through the real twisters that could tell you what an F-5<br />looks feels and sounds like.Everyday occurances like this<br />Hollwood could not resist and they had a huge summer hit.<p>  Jo at the beginning of the film just a little girl<br />her family is terrorized when her home is hit by an F-5<br />a tornado that can be in excess of 250 to 314 miles an<br />hour she tragically loses her father in the monster.<br />Now we come to present day in the film Bill Thornton who<br />is played by (Bill Paxton) and Dr.Melissa Reeves(Jami Gertz)<br />who are engaged are visiting a much older Jo(Helen Hunt)<br />to finalize there divorce.But little does Bill know that<br />he will coming on for a much further trip then just divorce<br />papers when he sees his old crew and the new satillite that<br />Jo has improved on that was his vision TOTO(Totable Tornado<br />Observatory)which he affectionately calls Dorthy.<p>  Having spats along the way with his fiance povides humor<br />but when the leechey Jonas Miller(Carey Elwes)thwarts there<br />misson and come up with the same idea as Bill a showdown is<br />looming as Bill tells Jo that weither Dorthy flies or not<br />he will leave in two days,this puts Twister into action ,<br />trying to beat Jonas to the punch and to get close enough to<br />the Tornadoes to release there cargo,they make a pit stop<br />at Aunt Megs (Loius Smith),where Twister get's a little bit<br />of an emotional storyline that Jo may still have feelings<br />for Bill Thornton,but after this scene Twister picks up and<br />pretty much gets right to the point,in one scene that is the<br />scariest of Twister at a drive in a Tornado looms as the<br />tension builds as the F-4 rips right through the drive in<br />and the town of Wetchitaw where Aunt Meg is the team hurrys<br />to save her life and when they do only to find that an F-5<br />is on the way,they must do anything and everything they can<br />to get there cargo in the monster of a twister so they can<br />save lives.<p>  Jan De Bont's tense and taught thriller is not without<br />it's humor Dusty(Phillip Seymour Hoffman)is the comic relief<br />in this film and provides laughs, the story between Bill Thornton<br />and Jo is romantic but is just not what the doctor orderd in a<br />film that has a title like Twister which is the real star with<br />incredible special effects from Industrial Light and Magic we<br />can now see what happens from outside and inside a twister but<br />the sustained F-5 at the films climax is incredible as it ,<br />destroys houses levels buildings , throws tractors and an oil<br />tanker and gives our charachters a run for there money.<p>  Twister has a worth while commentary from Jan De Bont<p>and is produced by Michel Chriton it has two documentarys<br />and is featured in DTS 5.1. that well if you don't know<br />what a tornado sounds like this is the closest your going<br />to get in fact the sound is so clear that it's the second<br />best iv'e heard next to Saving Private Ryan hey this may<br />not be an Award winning film but it's one that is worth<br />adding to your collection.</p></body></html>

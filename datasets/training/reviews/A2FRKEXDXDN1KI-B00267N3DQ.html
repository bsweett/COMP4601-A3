<meta name="summary" content="Blu-ray: Disney set the bar high in 2001 with the `Platinum Edition' release, this `Diamond Edition' sets the bar even higher"></head><body><p>The Blu-ray looks fantastic.  For this classic film from 1937 to look so vibrant, so spectacular, so beautiful 72 years later is a testament towards Disney's restoration and remastering.  The picture quality is absolutely pristine.  The new lossless  7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio is magnificent.  "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition" is highly recommended!<br /><br />For Walt Disney, seeing a play back in 1916 of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" based on the fairty tale by the Brothers Grimm definitely made the producer to attempt something that has never been done before and that is to create a full-length color animated film.<br /><br />Known for their "Silly Symphony" animated shorts, the 1937 animated film definitely silenced anyone who thought that Disney was not able to pull off a full-length animated feature.  Even Walt Disney's wife thought that no one would want to watch a film that starred dwarfs but needless to say, the film that was called "Disney's Folly" by naysayers would receive critical praise and even demand by fans for a sequel.  The film would be not only be a classic animated film which was honored by the American Film Institute as the "Greatest Animation of All Time".  Even today, adjusted by inflation, the film is considered one of the top 10 money making films in America of all time.<br /><br />In 2001, when the "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" was released on DVD, the DVD was one of the films that were known for its innovation, winning a "Video Premiere Award" for "Best Overall New Extra Features" and nominated for "Best DVD Menu Design" and "Best New, Enhanced or Reconstructed Movie Scenes".<br /><br />But now in 2009, the film makes its High Definition entry on Blu-ray with 1080p High Definition picture quality and 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound.  Also, a Disney Blu-ray + DVD Combo Pack (two Blu-ray discs and a DVD version of the film) which comes out on October 6,  seven weeks before its Deluxe Two-Disc Classic standard definition DVD which will be released on Nov. 24th.  It's also important to note that a limited edition collector's set will also be available<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" gets its 1080p High Definition transfer and its absolutely beautiful.  Viewers can choose to watch the film in its original 4:3 (1:33:1)  format and watch it  with DisneyView featuring Tony Bluth's artwork on the side (for those who have widescreen televisions).  According to the guide included with this release, restoration experts took full advantage of the newest breakthroughs of digital imaging technologies to produce this classic.  The process took nearly a year of cleanup and scanning over 350,000 frames of the original 75-year-old negative.  And the digital artists then removed dust and scratches from the cels.<br /><br />The picture quality is absolutely beautiful for a film that is 72-years old.  The restoration and remastering has removed all dust and scratches.  I don't think I've seen any blemishes on video.  The picture quality is absolutely beautiful as art backgrounds just look absolutely divine. I don't think I have realized how exquisite the backgrounds were, especially the amount of emotion that went into the animation.  Picture quality for "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition" is definitely magnificent and I look forward to seeing Disney continue this trend of remastering their classic animated films.  As for DisneyView, similar to "Pinocchio", Toby Bluth's painted borders that are on the sides of the animation matches the animation quite fine and was definitely my preference over standard black bars.<br /><br />As for the accompanying DVD, the DVD is featured in an aspect ratio of 1:33:1.<br /><br />Audio is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio (48 kHz/24-bit), the original mono presentation and also French and Spanish 5.1 DEHT restored original theatrical soundtrack.  The film is dialogue and music driven with the soundtrack being front and center channel driven.  Music is also featured during the surround and rear surround channels as well.  Dialogue and music is crystal clear and understandable.  During the more emotional sequences, such as Snow White running away from home in the forest, definitely makes the room quite immersive, albeit a short while but overall, a good use of utilizing the music of Snow White through all channels.  There are other parts that really come through on all channels such as a shriek by Snow White coming clear from the rear surrounds which was quite nice (and surprising).  Overall, a solid lossless audio soundtrack for a 72-year old animated film.<br /><br />As for the audio of the accompanying DVD, the DVD comes with an English, French and Spanish 5.1 DEHT soundtrack.<br /><br />Subtitles are provided in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES<br /><br />"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition" is absolutely loaded with special features.  In fact, I think this is the most special features I have ever seen for any video release of a film ever.  Special features range from 1080p High Definition and 480i Standard Definition.  Soundtrack is in English, French and Spanish 2.0.  Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.  Also is a booklet including a navigational overview of the special features included on both Blu-ray discs.<br /><br />Special features included are:<br /><br />DISC 1:<br /><br />  * Magic Mirror - Using the latest in Blu-ray technology, the iconic magic Mirror guides the audience through the Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition features with ease, serving as the host for an incredibly immersive experience.

Needless to say, the DVD won several awards for its technology and so, when the announcement came that "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" will receive a Diamond Edition Blu-ray disc release, I was curious to see how Disney could top themselves because that release was already phenomenal.<br /><br />I have since gone through the Blu-ray release and all I can say is...Wow!<br /><br />Disney has not only topped the Platinum Edition release, they have set the bar once again for a Blu-ray release and the amount of content that can be included on a Blu-ray and let alone, how awesome they were able to digitally restore the classic 1937 film.<br /><br />There was no doubt in my mind that Disney would give their first animated feature on Blu-ray the best treatment as possible and as this release is a celebration of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs", it's also a celebration of the talent behind the film.  Those who were involved with Hyperion Studios that created the "Silly Symphonies" animated shorts back in the early 1930's and using the technology at that time and building it, in order to create their first full feature animated masterpiece.<br /><br />In fact, not only do we get audio of those who worked on the film but we also are treated with those classic animated shorts such as "Babes in the Woods", "The Skeleton Dance", "Music Land", "Goddess of Spring", "Playful Pluto", "The Old Mill", "Steamboat Willie" and more.  And to make things even more impressive, these shorts are featured in HD (not cleaned up but still much better than their DVD counterparts). This Blu-ray release manages to capture the various process of the film from creating the story, the music, the art, the backgrounds, the layout, the animation, the live action references, decisions at the sweatbox meetings, ink and paint and how women were involved in the animated process at the time, the camera department, soundstage, etc.<br /><br />So much is included on both Blu-ray discs in terms of special features, so much went into restoring this film, that this release is one, if not the top video releases of all time.  I have no doubt in my mind that probably ten years from now, this Blu-ray will be highly revered for its content.<br /><br />I know that many people own the 2001 Platinum DVD Edition of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" and are wondering if it's worth the double dip and the answer is YES!  There is just so much included on the Diamond Edition, way more than the 2001 Platinum Edition.  Also, if you are now wanting these classic Disney films in High Definition, its definitely worth the move to see this classic film in High Definiton.  But I must say that you should not toss away your 2001 DVD edition because there are video clips such as the "Excerpt from The Story of Silly Symphony", "Excerpt from Tricks of Our Trade", "Camera Tests", "Abandoned Concepts", vintage audio (radio shows and spots are not included) and several songs and deleted scenes which are not included on this Diamond Edition release.<br /><br />So, overall it's a no-brainer that "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition" is definitely worth it.  For High Definition fans, the film looks and sounds absolutely gorgeous on Blu-ray.  And as mentioned, the sheer amount of content included in this release is absolutely incredible.<br /><br />I really don't have any negatives but me being nitpicky that it would have been nice to have certain special features such as the vintage radio/audio content , a few deleted scenes, songs and video clip excerpts from the 2001 Platinum Edition DVD included on the Diamond Edition.  And personally, for me that is the only thing that prevents me from calling this release absolute perfection.  There was one other thing and that is my Blu-ray discs came in a black DVD case, not the standard blue casing.  I was told that there will be two releases (in different casing, not inc. the limited edition) with one in a blue Blu-ray case and another using black DVD casing in order to educate those new to Blu-ray.<br /><br />I do think that Diamond Edition and the Platinum Edition are quite different in terms of presentation of special features and the goals were quite different of what kind of special features would be presented.  With the Platinum Edition, its solely focused on "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" and in the Diamond Edition, there is more focus on giving the viewer the history of Walt Disney and the animators of how they got from Silly Symphonies to using their skills and technology in creating the first animated feature film.  So, as I have said earlier in my review, this release is more or less, a celebration of those who worked on the film and giving recognition to those animators and staff members who took part in that film and the work that they did earlier, that became instrumental in creating Snow White.<br /><br />So, overall...the Diamond Edition is just incredible when it comes to the actual digital restoration of this classic film and a release that is absolutely packed with special features.  "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs: Diamond Edition" is a solid release that raises the bar of what Disney is capable of in terms of content in a home video release.  This is truly a magnificent release and is highly recommended!</p></body></html>

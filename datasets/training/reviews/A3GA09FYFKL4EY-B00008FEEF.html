<meta name="summary" content="Scary, but not as good as the first"></head><body><p>First off, I DID like the movie, but the viewer is asked to suspend belief one too many times....mainly, that a hospital is SO dimly lit (even the halls are dark), and there are so few nurses. In one scene, Michael Myers is in a nursery full of babies and NO ONE IS WATCHING THEM. This large hospital is pretty poorly staffed! Two, Jamie Lee Curtis' parents can't be reached ALL NIGHT LONG? Wow, didn't they leave a number?  A nurse and EMT find plenty of time to sneak off into a hot tub. There is only the one doctor and he vanishes. NAH........not as good or suspenseful as the first. But maybe that was an impossible task.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another bad summer movie."></head><body><p>It's hard to think of good things to say about this "dial-it-in-for -big-bucks" sequel, whose only shining moments are occasional sly looks and slurred lines from its talented star, Johnny Depp. And even those moments, sadly, feel like stale caricatures.<br /><br />It's boring .. which seems a major feature of this year's so-called blockbusters. The plot is pointlessly byzantine, messy, and unoriginal. The acting ranges from earnestly average (Orlando Bloom) to casually shallow (Kiera Knightly, who looks downright emaciated) to uninspired and campy (Johnny Depp), all of which isn't helped by the script.<br /><br />It's excessive ... throwing a kitchen since of repetitive plot points and special effects in lieu of a few memorable ones.<br /><br />It's way too long ... at least by thirty minutes.<br /><br />It's unfocussed ... meandering, unentertainingly, through sequences that range in feel from a bad sitcom to a lifeless epic, including this detour to deal with "natives" (who look and act like a combination of stereotypes from old, mediocre movies) and a badly filmed fight sequence in this giant wooden wheel that keeps rolling through the rain forest ... and rolling ... and rolling ... and zzzzzz.<br /><br />Overall, this sequel presents as a something no one took seriously -- figuring it would make money even if it ended up being hours of self-indulgent, overwrought slop.<br /><br />Which it is.</p></body></html>

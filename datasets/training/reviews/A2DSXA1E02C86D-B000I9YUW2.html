<meta name="summary" content="Beam transporter needs some fine tuning"></head><body><p>When Captain Kirk ordered, "Beam me up, Scotty!", he didn't have this in mind.<br /><br />Julianne Moore is Telly Paretta, a grieving mother that lost her 9-year old son in a plane crash months previous. Her memories of him are vivid. Trouble is, her husband (Anthony Edwards), shrink (Gary Sinise), and a former baby-sitter, claim that the boy never existed. In psychiatric techno-babble, she's "nuts". It doesn't help that any pictures of Telly and her son together now display with the latter missing. Creative PhotoShop editing by a guv'mint conspir'cy, perhaps? Or maybe space aliens?<br /><br />The beginning premise of THE FORGOTTEN is engaging enough through the first half or so of the film. Then, as Telly gets closer and closer to the truth, the plot becomes ridiculous. First, the National Security Agency (representing that inevitable guv'mint conspir'cy) makes its appearance, then ... well, Kirk would have had Scotty up on charges for heavy-handedness with the transporter. The film's concluding scene at the children's jungle gym in the park made me pause for a moment and reflect on the disconcerting inconvenience that time warps would add to our lives.<br /><br />Moore, who can be my Mommy anytime she wants, is a wonderful and gorgeous actress who deserves better. Who's her agent, anyway? In any case, her fine job in this stinker is the only reason for more than a two-star rating.</p></body></html>

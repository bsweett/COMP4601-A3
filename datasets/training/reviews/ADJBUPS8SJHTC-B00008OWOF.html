<meta name="summary" content="What a movie!!"></head><body><p>I still cannot believe how a young man could do what he did. And all under the age of 21. Basically, you had this young fella(Leonardo DiCaprio),who lives with his parents(a failed store owner and French wife)whose marriage breaks up,and the father keeps going in deeper in business ruin. So, the son Frank Abignale,Jr., poses as a pilot,doctor and lawyer,writing up to over 1.5 million dollars in checks. Tom Hanks plays the wily yet persistent Federal agent who stays on the case, and in turn rehabilitates him. This movie will keep definitely keep you on your toes.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Now, Father, You're Living in the Past.  This is the 14th Century.""></head><body><p>This is another classic fairy tale given the Disney treatment.  The story is rather familiar.  When the Princess Aurora is born, she is presented to her kingdom.  Yet the celebration is short lived when the evil enchantress Maleficent (Eleanor Audley) shows up uninvited.  As retaliation, she curses the baby to prick her finger on a spinning wheel and die by the evening of her sixteenth birthday.<br /><br />Fortunately, the three good fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, are there to soften the curse.  Aurora won't die, just fall into an enchanted sleep so only love's first kiss can wake her.  They even plot to hide and raise Aurora as their own to keep the curse from coming true.  Will that plan succeed?  Is there any way to defeat Maleficent?<br /><br />This movie is often praised for it's look, and rightly so.  Based on artwork from the Middle Ages, it provides a stylized look.  The amount of detail in the backgrounds alone is amazing.  The characters fit this stylized world while still looking real.  Additionally, the background music is majestic.  It is adapted from bits and pieces of Tchaikovsky's ballet based on the fairy tale, and it fits the look of the film perfectly.<br /><br />And as much as it looks and sounds great, this isn't my favorite of the Disney princess movies.  There is only one song from the movie that is at all memorable.  "Once Upon a Dream" is great.  The others are choral pieces that slow things down.  Speaking of slowing things down, the prologue, while needed to set up the story, is very slow.  Once we get to Aurora's sixteenth birthday, things pick up.  But even then, the princess comes across as a boring character.  The thing that saves this film story wise are the fairies.  The three good fairies are wonderfully funny.  And Maleficent is an exciting evil villain.  In fact, she might scare young kids.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this is a good movie.  But when compared to Disney's other fairy tales, it is a little weak.</p></body></html>

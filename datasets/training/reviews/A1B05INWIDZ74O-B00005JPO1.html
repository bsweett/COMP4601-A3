And like his other movies this Indiana Jones adventure springs from a genuine archeological mystery. We should have expected this topic since the crystal skull is back in vogue again as we approach 2012, the year the thirteen crystal skulls need to be rejoined according to Mayan legend. One of the problems is the movie takes place in 1957. And the skulls do not match the shape of those that have been found since the 1860's.<br /><br />Crystal skulls really exist and look like human, unlike in the movie. No one knows much about the real skulls. They have no tool marks as is described in the movie, but they do exist. As does the Mitchell-Hedges skull that is mentioned in the movie, which has unsubstantiated Mayan origins and supposed mystical powers.<br /><br />Now back to 1957 and the movie. Since the Nazi's have been defeated Indiana Jones new nemesis is the Russians and the McCarthy induced paranoid F.B.I. Which makes sense for that time in U.S. history. Harrison Ford plays Indiana Jones well, he is still has his great one-liners while performing death defying acts and still using his skills to deftly solve all the puzzles. Instead of Indy's specialty of the spiritual or mystical mystery, we are taken into the realm of Sci-Fi.<br /><br />Cate Blanchett plays our villain, Stalin's favorite psychic scientist, Irina Spalko. Her acting is good, but as a villain she is not too diabolical. I hate to say it, but at times she seems almost comical, yet professional enough to stay in character. We start off with her forcing Indy to find an item in a government warehouse that is obviously White Sands New Mexico, which is near Roswell. And because of his actions, Indy is set off on an adventure that is not of his choosing. As he escapes a situation, which would not be possible, even for Indy to escape. Which leads us to what the film is lacking, that feel that Indy is never in any real danger.<br /><br />Mutt Williams played by Shia LeBeouf is the key that starts him on his quest to save a friend and find the crystal skull. It is as if Mutt is being groomed to carry on the series as he becomes Indy's sidekick. He is ok for a few moments at a time, but I am not sure if he could pick up for Harrison Ford. Perhaps Indy will give us one more adventure before he retires.<br /><br />Then Indy's love interest from "Raiders," Marion, once again played by Karen Allen, is back and is the real star of this movie. Like some of the other reviewers I do not wish to ruin the surprise on how she fits into the plot of the movie. But I was sure pleased to see her as she steps back into her role as Marion. And She still has the on screen chemistry with Indy with the fiery personality that we remember.<br /><br />This fourth installment of Indiana Jones is a little contrived, the plot is not the greatest, but if you just go along for the fast packed action ride with great visual effects you should enjoy it. Three-and-half stars, but since Karen Allen played her part so well I'll rate it four and watch it again when its on DVD.</p></body></html>

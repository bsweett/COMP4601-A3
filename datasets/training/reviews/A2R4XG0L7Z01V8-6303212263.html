(I've never seen Smallville yet - probably not a good idea to get started on that one, I've still got loads of others to watch.) People have always said, the first actor you see playing a certain role, will never compare to anyone else. Up until now, I didn't think anyone but Dean Cain could play Superman.<br /><br />How wrong I was. After watching this film (and buying Superman II and Superman Returns), I have to say I love Christopher Reeve as Superman. Not only does he fill the suit rather well, he's hotter than Dean Cain (can't believe I once spent a "Bring Your Daughter To Work Day" trawling the internet at my Dad's work looking for photos of him!), and he brings a whole new dimension to the character of Clark Kent. With Dean, he was just a guy in glasses, with almost exactly the same hair. Christopher turns Clark into a bumbling idiot, who seems to be out of sorts with everything around him, and parts his hair on a different side, whether he's Clark or Superman.<br /><br />I certainly hope the second movie starts with more of a bang than this one did. Just over an hour before we actually get to see Christopher as Superman. I hated the beginning, and really was going to switch it off, but thankfully, I didn't. It was just way too much, and what Marlon Brando got paid was absolutely shocking. He got paid $3.7 million, and as if that wasn't enough, he also got a percentage of the profits for playing Jor-El for 12 (TWELVE) shooting days. The fee (plus the percentage) also covered the sequel, which was being simultaneously shot with the original. He didn't appear in the sequel however, as he was involved in a lawsuit over non-payment of his profit-participation for the original movie. He ultimately received about $14 million for his ten minutes on film. ($14 MILLION).<br /><br />I wasn't keen on Margot Kidder's interpretation of Lois Lane. I loved Teri Hatcher's version of the character, but wasn't so keen on this one. She seemed to scream at every opportunity, and certainly played the traditional damsel in distress character, which was very grating. Teri certainly didn't do that - she gave Lois Lane (to put it politely) balls, who didn't need a guy in tights to save her.<br /><br />The film was excellent, and I was shocked at the quality of the CGI, during the flying sequences - but in a good way. I seriously expected the CGI to be worse than it was, particularly for a film made in 1978. I only noticed the CGI a couple of times, but I've seen it a lot worse in other films. I was very impressed, as I was expecting to notice it a lot.<br /><br />Christopher Reeve certainly had talent, and it showed in this. He's so hot too! It's such a shame what has happened since, and it still makes me sad thinking about it. In my opinion, he's definitely the best Superman, and I doubt that will change when I watch Superman Returns. (Although Brandon Routh could have been his twin, they look pretty similar!)<br /><br />Overall, I was really impressed with this film, although I think it could have been better in parts, but Christopher's performance more than makes up for that. I look forward to seeing the second, and then I might make a decision about the third & fourth. But then again, I might just buy it for Christopher. He's definitely hot. Even if he does wear tights, and his underwear on the outside.</p></body></html>

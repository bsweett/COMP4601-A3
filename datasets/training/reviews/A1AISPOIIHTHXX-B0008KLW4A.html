<meta name="summary" content="It's bad but not Uwe Boll bad"></head><body><p>I often cite films by Ed Wood and Uwe Boll as perfect educational films. Why? Well they're perfect examples of how not to make a film. So when films come out every year that are really terrible, you just gotta ask "is this worse than Plan 9 or Alone in the Dark? Well with Catwoman we find a film that's better than those but that's not saying much.<br /><br />Patience Phillips(why they changed it from Selina Kyle is beyond me) works as an advertisement artist for a beauty creme company. In order to make a deadline, she searches an old factory and finds out something bad about the upcoming Beau-Line(prounounced Beeyoo-Lin for some reason) and gets washed up in the river. Brought back to life by a mystical cat, which for some reason worked better under Tim Burton, she comes back as Catwoman ready to do battle against justice, and flirt with a cop.<br /><br />I haven't heard of a Rogues Gallery villain in Superman or Batman that got their own movie. You don't see Brainiac trying to save the world somewhere, or Two-Face fighting crime. So when Batman comics jewel thief becomes a crime fighter, it's kind of "huh?". And like I said, the decision to name her Patience Phillips instead of time tested Selina Kyle is forever lost to me. Imagine Superman being called Trevor Smith. Not to mention the costume looks quite ridiculous since not only does Halle Berry have an obvious skin tone but it just smacks of laziness.<br /><br />An unfortunate by-product of upstart directors is they're a little clueless on how to edit action scenes, believing the more faster the cuts, the more energetic it is. Compare this to Spielberg, Cameron or Zemeckis films that allow the action to unfold at its own pace. Here it's literally blink and you'll miss it shots. I know kids today have ADD when watching a movie but this is pushing it.<br /><br />It's right up there with Punisher and Fantastic Four as bad comic book movies but it's kind of borderline dumb entertainment and nothing more...unless you get a kick in seeing Halle Berry in her costume.</p></body></html>

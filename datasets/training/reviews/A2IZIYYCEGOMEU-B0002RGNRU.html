<meta name="summary" content="A BRUTALLY HONEST EXPLORATION OF LOVE"></head><body><p>I was not a fan of Jim Carrey's until I saw this film. I bought it because Charlie Kaufman wrote the screenplay, and I loved BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, and ADAPTATION. I have, to date, worn out two discs of THE ETERNAL SUNSHINE....<br /><br />The reason I love this movie so much is I've never seen one- ever- that was able to encapsulate with such terrible clarity, and frank eloquence, the nature of love, and ( specifically ) why we love. Though this masterpiece is extremely moving, hysterical, and lethally ascerbic, it is anything but cute.<br /><br />Jim Carrey should have gotten an Oscar for his performance, as the quiet, loner, Joel, and Kate Winslet was equally wonderful. The entire cast was superb, in fact. The direction, and cinematography was great, but the story was genius.<br /><br />Be smart, and get a little Sunshine....</p></body></html>

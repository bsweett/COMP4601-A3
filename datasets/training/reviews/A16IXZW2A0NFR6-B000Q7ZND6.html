This is definatly not as crappy as say, Catwoman, Elektra, the lackluster HellBoy, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, The Hulk, Daredevil, Spawn, and is also better than the two Matrix sequels. That being said that really doesn't mean much though because that is a pretty crappy list. Keanu Reeves does well as the title character and the supporting cast is really good as well, but this film is strictly for genre fans. Some good effects make up for the silly theological mish mash.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Clooney leads an excellent cast in "Clayton""></head><body><p>In "Michael Clayton" George Clooney plays the eponymous character, the lawyer at a large firm who has the job of cleaning up unsavory things that happen around the edges of the firm and its clients.<br /><br />Sidney Pollack gives a respectable performance as the head of the firm.  Tom Wilkinson is brilliant as one of the leading attorneys of the film who has become more than a little unhinged by the fact that his practice regularly defends corporate criminals.<br /><br />Tilda Swinton plays Karen Crowder, an icy lawyer for a competing firm with the current corporation in big-stakes litigation.  Her character is climbing up the corporate legal ladder as quickly as possible, and she intuits that some of her goals may be achieved by means that are far removed from legal.  One of the greatest scenes in the film involves Karen arranging a hit - an arena she's willing to enter, but one where she lacks experience.<br /><br />Writer Tony Gilroy also directs, and his script is magnificent.  The opening thirty minutes are confusing as the opening scene is followed by a flashback, but by the time the narrative again reaches the opening sequence you realize that you've been in the hands of a master.<br /><br />Greatest praise is for George Clooney.  As good as the writing, direction and other actors are, it would simply be a lesser film without Mr. Clooney's work.  Michael Clayton is a tortured man - a lawyer at a large, successful firm, but somehow less than he imagined himself.  As the credits roll you feel a degree of vindication for the character, and Clooney's portrayal makes you care that much more for what has happened.</p></body></html>

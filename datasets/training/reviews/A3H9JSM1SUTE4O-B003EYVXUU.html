<meta name="summary" content="THE HAUNTING POWER OF LOVE -- THE SACRIFICES WE MAKE FOR EVEN FLEETING INTIMACY"></head><body><p>It's rare when a Hollywood remake of a widely acclaimed foreign film is as good as the original.  (Just look at what happened to THE VANISHING!)  Matt Reeves, whose previous film CLOVERFIELD was a hit, adapted the Danish coming of age vampire thriller LET THE RIGHT ONE IN and made a nearly perfect Americanized film that has a heart of pure horror.  I usually hate vampire films for a lot of reasons but I love this moody, atmospheric dream that treats desire and alienation with a delicacy that makes real the sacrifices we choose to make for even fleeting intimacy.  Set in Los Alamos, Colorado -- a community with the highest IQ per capita -- the story has a bullied, frail 12-year-old Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) befriending his strange next-door neighbor, Abby (a terrific Chloe Moretz from KICK ASS).  Their outcast bond fortifies Owen to stand up to the bullies.  But when Owen confirms his suspicions that Chloe has a big secret, it's too late; his fate is sealed.  This beautifully acted, visually rich, stunning and tragic love story is perfect in almost every way.  Sadly, it was little seen in theaters and deserves to be rediscovered for home video.  The always fine Richard Jenkins co-stars.</p></body></html>

This time it's just chasing, fist fighting, and shooting. Most things that made "Identity" refreshing -- the wit, the incongruity, the uncertainty, the novelty of its premise -- are gone in " Supremacy." That isn't bad, but it is disappointing for anyone who remembers what made the first movie so enjoyable. Greengrass, who directed this sequel, couples his approach with two acute mistakes in strategy: He consistently forgets to clue the audience in on basic information, such as who is shooting at whom, and why. And he films every action scene as though doing a behind-the-camera interpretive dance based on Don Knotts' classic performance in "The Shakiest Gun in the West." That said, "The Bourne Supremacy" is still definitely entertaining. More interestingly, it's a testament to Damon and what his physical presence somehow just conveys. The title, "Supremacy," promises something it doesn't deliver, something further suggested by the advertising tagline, "They should have left him alone." The title suggests a reversal of the first movie, with Bourne, in possession of himself and the facts, mounting an offensive against the people who've victimized him. But the movie is really a muddle. Bourne is improvising, getting shot at here, strangling somebody there. He has no system. There's really no villain, unless you count some nameless Russian assassin or poor Abbott, who is too much of a nervous wreck to inspire an audience's bloodlust. This whole spectacle of confusion could have been made into something with some ironic distance. But the only distance Greengrass creates is that which comes of bad technique: wobbly images, and blurred fragments. And we're in no position to appreciate the irony of the situation if we have no idea what's going on.</p></body></html>

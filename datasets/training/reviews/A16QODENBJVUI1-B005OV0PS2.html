<meta name="summary" content="One of the strangest and best comedies of the past decade"></head><body><p>At his moment in the history of American film, I wonder if the Coen brothers aren't our most interesting filmmakers. Even their misses are more interesting than most other's hits. Of all their films, I personally believe that THE BIG LEBOWSKI is the finest film they have made yet. <p>If in MADAME BOVARY Flaubert attempted (and succeeded) at writing a novel without a heroine, in THE BIG LEBOWSKI the Coen brothers made a film without a hero. Jeff Bridges plays the title role of Jeff "The Dude" Lebowski, who isn't so much everyday as considerably below nondescript. He is poor, unambitious, unobtrusive, and unspectacular. His only goals in life appear to be bowling, smoking pot, and drinking White Russians. That "The Dude" could be the center of a motion picture seems spectacularly absurd. That the movie succeeds despite such humble assumptions is a testament both to the Coen brothers and Jeff Bridges. I have long considered Bridges to be one of the most underrated performers in the movies today. Interestingly, it may be the movie in which he was most playing himself. I saw a segment of BIOGRAPHY on A&E on Jeff Bridges, and his wife mentioned that in this film he was pretty much playing himself, and, in fact, wore the clothes he wears in everyday life in much of it. Gotta love that.<p>On one level, this movie is absurd. Intentionally absurd.  The various elements, in the hands of lesser individuals than the Coen brothers, might fall apart into something dumb. Instead, they meld it into something remarkable. John Goodman's diatribes about the boys in Vietnam, or his dedication to the Jewish Sabbath (despite not being Jewish), or the many jokes about Nihilists, or Goodman's awe at being in the semi-presence (the man is unconsicious and in an iron lung) of a man who wrote most of the episodes of the TV show BRANDED, or John Turturro's absolutely demented turn as a Hispanic bowler, or Philip Seymour Hoffman's marvelous turn as the personal assitant to multi-millionaire Jeff Lebowski, or Sam Elliot as the seemingly omniscient "The Stranger" all are elements that improbably blend together to make an absolute masterpiece. Bizarrely, the more absurd the Coen Bros become, the better the film becomes. <p>The cast is as good as one can possibly imagine. Jeff Bridges, has I mentioned, is just perfect in the lead. John Goodman and Steve Buscemsi are just as good as his bowling partners/best friends. Goodman's frequent blow-ups are among the best moments in the movie. Tara Reid has gone on to larger roles since this film, but she has never been better than in the small but crucial role of Bunny Lebowski. Peter Stormare (notable before this as the more insane of the two murderers in FARGO, the one Frances MacDormand catches trying to put the leg of Steve Buscemi into a pulping machine) is just incredible as the leader of the "Nihilists." Philip Seymour Hoffman, John Turturro, Ben Gazzara, and Juliane Moore all make a good movie even better. And Flea, of the Chilli Peppers, makes a small appearance as one of the Nihilists.<p>This is just a great film. It isn't just a must see, but a must see over and over. Few films of recent years have so many moments that I enjoy recalling as this one. And although OH BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU! and THE MAN WHO WASN'T THERE, the two films that have followed THE BIG LEBOWSKI, haven't been quite up to its level, I still look forward to a new Coen brothers film more than just about any other. <p>One other note. The music for this film is just incredible. One of the most striking moments occurs when the viewer is assaulted with a brutal version in Spanish of "Hotel California." It is worth noting that the person responsible for assembling the songs for the sound track was none other than T-Bone Burnett. Although O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? was not a great movie, it did feature a spectacular soundtrack. T-Bone Burnett was responsible for the music of both films.</p></body></html>

I'm glad I read the book a few years ago. At least it held my attention more than this movie.<br /><br />Josh Hartnett, as "Bucky - ICE" the L.A. Detective is a real boring and stiff. Aaron Eckhardt, as "Lee - FIRE," his partner was intense, but average. Scarlett Johannson, "Kay" and Hilary Swank, "Madeleine" were also big bores, and they showed it with their acting.<br /><br />It was almost like watching a stage play; with the dinner at Madeleine's house being excruciatingly painful to watch. As was the "love scene" with Hartnett and Swank, which looked like a "Carol Burnett Show" or "Saturday Night Live" parody of a classic movie. Some of these scenes will make you or snicker or laugh; which in effect, will wake you up and out of your boredom enough to finish the movie.<br /><br />At 53 minutes into the movie, I checked the timing display to find that the movie is 121 minutes long. As Doctor Smith from "Lost In Space" used to say: "The pain. Oh, the pain."</p></body></html>

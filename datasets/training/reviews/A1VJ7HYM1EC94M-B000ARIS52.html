I know, I know, there have been countless films inspired by the world of comic books which have attempted to recreate the chills and thrills.  Not one of them - even the best (e,g,, Spiderman series, Tales from the Crypt, etc.) has been remotely as successful as the creative team that gives us this brilliant, jarring, vision.<br /><br />Rodriguez, Miller and company obviously put themselves (and the cast) through painstaking paces to assure every frame, every emotion emoted by an astonishing array of live talent is instilled with the gritty, graphic hyperrealism of the world of Frank Miller.  It is a breathtaking achievement which, alas, will go unnoticed and be underappreciated by many who don't "get" this world.<br /><br />The cast is nothing short of remarkable:  Mickey Rourke gives his finest performance since Barfly - maybe ever.  Bruce Willis has never given a better performance than the retiring cop, Hartigan.  Everyone involved is obviously relishing having the time of their lives.  Outside of Shakespeare I can't imagine anything currently more theatrically over-the-top and satisfying than being associated with Sin City.<br /><br />For many the violence will be of too gory and graphic in nature (gorygraphic?).  Others will enjoy the rough ride but also be appreciative of the often stunning beauty of so many of this film's images.  The final tale in the trilogy of stories that make up the movie is shot with the cool and chill of winter bathed in a snow storm of such exquisite beauty that I don't find it difficult to say it is among the most beautiful images I've seen in any film.  Ever.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Slow burn, but with a great payoff"></head><body><p>"Hot Fuzz" takes a while to really hit its stride, but eventually builds to a wonderful parody of action films -- think the climax of "Desperado," as set in a bucolic English village.<br /><br />Lots of quality extras, as well. The tour documentary is especially worth a look.<br /><br />Recommended for fans of cop movies or British comedy. Heck, it'd even be worth a look for those Agatha Christie fans who enjoy a good action film, just to see the two collide so wonderfully here.</p></body></html>

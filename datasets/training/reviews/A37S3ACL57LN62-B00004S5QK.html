<meta name="summary" content="Wonderful Family Musical"></head><body><p>Singin in the Rain is perhaps one of the best loved musicals of American history. It focuses on movies making the transition from the silent to the sound era. Stars Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagan) plan to make The Dueling Cavalier as a silent film until sound revolutionizes the industry. It is created as a sound film, but they have much more trouble with the new technology than they imagined, not to mention the fact that the leading lady has a horribly inappropriate voice for her looks and for the part. The movie is saved when Lockwood's girlfriend Kathy (Debbie Reynolds) agrees to dub the part, helping to turn it into a musical. With the help of their wisecracking friend Cosmo (Donald O'Connor), they serve to make the film a hit.<br /><br />All of the actors have their charms in this film, even the annoyingly vocalized character Lamont. O'Connor is funny and exuberant throughout the film, Kelly is charming and mischievious, and Reynolds is incredibly sweet.<br /><br />The only drawback is the long "Gotta Dance" sequence with Cyd Charisse. Although it demonstrates the ability to tell stories without dialogue and the power of dance, it tends to lose the audience for a moment. Some will enjoy it, but it takes the audience out of the film for quite a while for seemingly no reason. The rest of the music is great; most of it has been taken from other films from past eras (think Moulin Rogue) and incorperated into the story. The flapper era is captured more glamorously than it truly was, but it adds to the charm of the film. The film relies on stereotypes of silent films, but it also thrills film buffs with the references to classic movies. This film has something for everyone which makes it truly one of the great films of American cinema.</p></body></html>

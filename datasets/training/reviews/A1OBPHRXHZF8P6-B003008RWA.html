Despite being a progressive, something about Moore hadn't previously really shaken me--until now.<br /><br />The depths which people go to merely to take care of ourselves would be amusing in an action adventure movie. But this is basic sustenance in what is supposed to be an affluent first world democracy. Scavenging for our sustenance is time-consuming. This concept also degrades the very notion that America is prosperous and the present model of healthcare successfully works.<br /><br />With emphasis currently being spent on rewarding the industry fat cats rather than practicing preventative medicine, American health care is poorly managed when compated against other western democracies. The individual testimonies throughout this film are heartbreaking  And they would not have had to make these journies in a universal health care system.</p></body></html>

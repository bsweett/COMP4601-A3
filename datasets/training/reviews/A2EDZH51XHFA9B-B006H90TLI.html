<meta name="summary" content="Best movie of 2007? Quite possibly."></head><body><p>No Country for Old Men (Joel and Ethan Coen, 2007)<br /><br />The Coen Brothers show, finally, that it is possible to successfully adapt a Cormac McCarthy novel to film. With adaptations of The Road (to be directed by John Hillcoat) and Blood Meridian (to be directed by Ridley Scott) on the horizon, that is quite a comforting thing.<br /><br />The plot, what there is of it, seems to center around Llewellyn Moss (Grindhouse's Josh Brolin), a hunter who stumbles upon the scene of a drug deal gone bad, and walks off with a satchel containing two million dollars. The owners of the money want it back, and so they hire psychotic escaped criminal Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) to track the money and get it back. On the other side of the equation is Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), the sherriff in the district where the drug deal went down, and Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson), an associate of Chigurh's who's a little less nuts, and is willing to let Moss live as long as he hands over the cash.<br /><br />This is a movie that succeeds on so many levels it's scary. Before getting to the obvious, however, the main reason for this movie's success, it seems to me, is the work of cinematographer Roger Deakins, whose use of light and shadow is a character in itself; the light (or lack of same) in this movie is a virtuoso performance, easily on the level of Darius Khondji's work on Se7en or Frank Byers' on Twin Peaks. There are dozens of scenes I could single out (and other critics have, with many of them) to illustrate the greatness to be found in the cinematography here, but one of the scenes that seems, on the surface, pedestrian really blew me away: there's a scene where Moss is in a motel room. He turns off the light, and the drapes are closed, so we see only a thin line of light coming in under the drapes, and all it illuminates is a part of Moss' cowboy hat, sitting on the bed. His hand comes into the light, picks up the hat, and then there's nothing for a few seconds until Moss opens the door and walks out. When was the last time you saw a scene like that in a film? It's gutsy. More to the point, its minimalism offsets the rest of the film, with its glorious over-the-top (and yet disturbingly realistic) violence. The Coens spend two hours putting the pedal to the floor in this movie; even the quiet scenes are tense. And here, in the middle, there's something that really is quiet; it's tense, but it's not "Anton Chigurh is sitting in the chair across from you" tense. Deakins was justly nominated for the Best Cinematography Academy Award, and it will be a crime if he doesn't collect.<br /><br />The movie has also been nominated for seven other Oscars, including Best Picture (and I have to say that it is, far and away, the best film I've seen released in 2007, as of this writing), Best Director, Adapted Screenplay, Editing, Sound, Sound Editing, and Supporting Actor. Odd that only one actor in this flick got an Oscar nod (and that being Javier Bardem, who is racking up ignored Oscar-worthy performances just as fast as Willem Dafoe; Bardem deserves this Oscar, as he has deserved many others, but odds are he won't win), since so many folks in this movie do such an excellent job. Tommy Lee Jones hasn't been this good on a screen in over two decades, and I say this as someone who's loved a lot of the movies he's made in the interim. Harrelson turns in his best performance since Natural Born Killers. Kelly MacDonald, who here plays Moss' clueless wife, is amazing. I've seen her before, but she never really registered with me. Barry Corbin and Trent Moore both have excellent bit parts. Bardem, of course, is always fantastic; there are many movies that are worth seeing just to watch the man act.<br /><br />What is most impressive here, however, despite all the accolades I've heaped on this film (and will continue to heap on it), is that despite the fact that the Coens have made an unflinchingly violent action movie, they have done so in such a way that it is still an absolutely beautiful film. It's pleasing to look at on just about every level.Even the bits that are difficult to watch keep you riveted simply because they're so well-framed and so perfectly shot. This is a movie that commands the attention in ways that very few films do; in fact, off the top of my head, the only movie I can think of that works in the same way is Rampo Noir. A truly amazing piece of work; the Coen Brothers' finest film. And that's saying something. **** ?</p></body></html>

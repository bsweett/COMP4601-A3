For a year as depressing as this one with maybe three or four movies really reaching me (Cinderella Man is by far the best movie to come out this year followed by this film, Crash, Batman Begins, Saw II and the ever under-appreciated Domino) I was so happy to walk out of a film feeling glad that I went.  Joaquin puts on a performance of a career and is a lock for the Best Actor nomination (with all the talk Hoffmans getting for Capote I doubt Phoenix will win, but he WILL be nominated) and Witherspoon is PERFECT as June Carter, almost even more perfect in her role than Joaquin was that her nomination may result in a win.  I never knew that much about the life of Johnny Cash, and I never really listened to his music, I mean I knew the song Ring of Fire...but after watching this movie I have a newfound respect for the man.  I've heard that the daughter or Cash and his first wife threw a fit about the way her mother was portrayed and that it was false...but you know that with EVERY biopic there are libertys taken, but these libertys do not take away from the feel of the film.  By the end you will be in tears and you will come to appreciate the man that is now the legend...</p></body></html>

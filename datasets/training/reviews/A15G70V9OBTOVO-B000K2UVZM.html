But this, this, is really something.  Slow, convoluted, miscast, dull and completely lacking in suspense.  It doesn't even have that much to do with Elizabeth Short.<br /><br />Except for Aaron Eckhart all the major characters look like kids who got into mom and dad's closet, trying to ape the style of the great 1940s actors.  None are convincing.  Aaron Eckhart is (surprisingly) even worse.<br /><br />The story is terribly convoluted and as if to make up for it, just when you think its over, there is an attempt to tie things up (pun possibly intended).  But this really isn't necessary for a case that was never solved.<br /><br />There are a few bright spots.  You get to see the inside of one of the Kessling houses in Silverlake (how they got their movie equipment on that street would make for a good supplement).  They also put together a beautiful diner set.  Mark Isham's score is the only other thing that doesn't come off as phony.<br /><br />This type of film always makes me think of The Two Jakes.  I know everybody hates The Two Jakes because its complicated but it gets L.A. in the 40s just right, great dialog from Robert Towne and of course Nicholson who looks more like a crime investigator than a male model.<br /><br />The book, by the way, is really something.  How Brian De Palma turned it into this, I can't imagine.</p></body></html>

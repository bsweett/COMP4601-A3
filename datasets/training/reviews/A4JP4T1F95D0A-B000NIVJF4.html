If I hadn't known it to be true, I would not have believed how his doctor came to Uganda and rose to be the rulers doctor and closest adviser.  Though the film is well told, it does swing back and forth from being a movie to being a documentary.  The acting is terrific with Whitaker doing a phenomenal job as Amin.  Interesting tale and well worth watching.</p></body></html>

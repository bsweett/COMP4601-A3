But my kids wanted it and I thought  "How bad can it be?" It has to be better than they say...It has Mark Walberg whom I usually enjoy, and director Shyamalan made the "Sixth Sense" which I loved. What I should have thought was "What if it is worse than "The Village?"<br />Sad to say it was.</p></body></html>

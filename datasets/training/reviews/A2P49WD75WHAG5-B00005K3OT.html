<meta name="summary" content="An exquisite confectionary tale about living"></head><body><p>Whether as an afternoon teatime snack, quick pick-me-up at work, or Halloween treat, chocolate has become a staple in America.  This movie is about chocolate, but about its use as a healer and its power to "unlock hidden yearnings and to shape destiny." Figures, since depression can be alleviated by chocolate.  And the creator of this confection in this extremely palatable movie is a healer herself.<p>Chocolat tells the story of two people who descend upon a provincial French village in the wake of a sly and strong north wind.  Those two people are Vianne and her young daughter Anouk.  Oh, perhaps I should say two people and an animal.  Anouk has an imaginary friend, Pontouf, who is a kangaroo.  She sets up shop, a potisserie, and opens it during Lent, not exactly perfect timing in a God-fearing village whose inhabitants believe in calm, tranquilitee, to use French.  Basically, knowing one's place, being obedient to authority, and going to church on Sunday are the pillars of this French village.<p>The idealist and romantic Vianne comes against the extremely conservative mayor, the Comte de Reynaud, as well as most of the people here.  She doesn't wear black, doesn't go to church on Sundays, and (gasp!) is an unwed mother.  She is also the only one who accepts Roux, the handsome leader of raft-bound river rats the town shuns as being immoral.  As a wanderer herself, Vianne naturally finds affinity with the riverfolk.<p>Before long, things start happening in the village.  People who buy her wares become more loosened in attitude, more courageous, and in the case of one married couple, saves their marriage with a rebirth in their sex life.  She also helps her landlady establish ties with her grandson, who has an affinity for drawing morbid pictures.  Basically, her altruistic spirit helps spread friendliness and helps certain townfolk relax from their hidebound ways.  Vianne gains the enmity of the mayor who sees her as an enemy, and seeks to drive her away by having sermons against temptation and of the powers of Satan concealing first a veiled, later an open attack against her wares.<p>This will be the ultimate Juliette Binoche film for me, and my favourite movie of 2000.  (OK, I know it came out in '99 but it came to my local theatre that year.)  I must admit I was torn between her and Julia Roberts as my Best Actress choice for 2000.  I've seen Alfred Molina play a large variety of roles, be it as Kenneth Halliwell (Prick Up Your Ears), Satipo (Raiders Of The Lost Ark), and most recently, as Diego Rivera in Frida.  His portrayal shows he can act as a diametric opposite of Rivera, an uptight, stuffed shirt traditionalist.  Lena Olin gets kudos as Josephine, a misunderstood kleptomaniac in a trapped marriage who follows her own drum.  Naturally, she is one of the first to befriend Vianne.  Judi Dench as Armand the landlady, and Peter Stormare as Josephine's odious and abusive husband also shine out here.<p>Chocolat also shows two things:  One, we need more people like Vianne to heal us.  Two, we need something to heal us, and no, I don't mean with standards such as religion or money, but something else that fills us within.  This movie's a nice confection that isn't sickly sweet or mere coloured sugar, but something with a rich flavour that will leave one's stomach glowing inside.</p></body></html>

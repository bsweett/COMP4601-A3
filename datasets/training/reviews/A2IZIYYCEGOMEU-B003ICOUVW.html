<meta name="summary" content="LOTS OF HAIR, AND PLENTY OF GORE, BUT..."></head><body><p>I'm a sucker for creature features, and I thought with the excellent cast for this reboot of the '41 classic with Lon Chaney Jr., and the phenomenal Claude Rains, not to mention some memorable werewolf pictures in the intervening years, they'd get this pic right.<br /><br />There was a lot of gore. Beheadings galore, in fact, and plenty of guttings, but eviscerations don't make the movie, and to see one of the great actors of our time ( Anthony Hopkins ) sleepwalking through his part, didn't help. If you're looking for 'the real deal,' stick with AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, or even THE HOWLING- or the original Chaney version of this tale. That is not to say that this movie was unwatchable. It was far more entertaining than the cutsie version of lycanthropy in THE TOILET ( pun definitely intended ) SAGA, or the syrupy soap opera, BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE. There were some very atmospheric effects, the recreation of period London was sweet, and Hugo Weaving did a great job with his part as a suspicious detective, but I don't feel compelled to go back and watch this thing again seven times in a week, as I did AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON back in 1981.</p></body></html>

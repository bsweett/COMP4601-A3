<meta name="summary" content="Going to Hell in a Hand-Basket -A Nihilistic Tale"></head><body><p>From the first few minutes of Joel and Ethan Coen's film adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel, "No Country for Old Men," I was hooked.  The opening scenes of the Texas hill country vaguely remind me of the golden beauty of Tuscany--a wild starkness sans the cypress trees that suggests the purity and serenity of an open landscape where from the beginning of time, men roamed simply because they wanted to and could. These men learned to manage not only the land--making it work for them in a symbiotic way where neither was destroyed and a careful reverent balance was maintained--but also and more importantly controlled the insidious evil that unfurled within this domain since the snake slithered into the Garden of Eden. As one of the triumvirate of main characters, Anton Chigurh, played with a succinct and taciturn cruelty by Javier Bardem, proves as he strangles his arresting officer with the very cuffs meant to restrain him, now darkness pervades; moral stability still lives on, albeit conditioned by what is thought to be lackadaisically acceptable for "modern" times.  Most definitely, the delicate balance once barely managed has spiraled out of the control of its sentinels.<br /><br />But what can be done about this rampant evil?  Nothing much, it seems.  We are damned if we do, and damned if we don't.<br /><br />In "No Country for Old Men," the inundation of evil (call it corruptness, depravity, immorality . . .whatever) that began with less dramatically insistent indicators like the absence of manners--no longer requiring the respectful usage of `sir' and `ma'am'--or the breakdown of appropriate dress--eyesores like wearing green hair and piercing bones in one's nose--has accelerated to an intensity level where drug deals, bloody carnage and murders are commonplace.  The infringement of this darker tolerance brings with it a Pandora's box of latter day plagues that symbolically battle-worn lawmen like Sheriff Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) attempt to clamp shut--with limited success.  One gets the sense of an overwhelming encroachment of all things bad--things that after awhile seem tame only through the conditioning of what we are told is acceptable.  Indeed, Bell knows that monsters like Chigurh are legion; wearing a marked world-weary grimace of frustration and futility on his face, he regrets, as his retirement looms, that time has outdated his methods and has matured him into the role of commentator rather than activator.  His hopes and aspirations lie now only in a field of dreams in which he must eventually awaken.<br /><br />In sharp contrast to Bell's caricature of the quintessential onlooker, Vietnam vet Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin)--his brash economy of motion belies his way lesser rank in the war between good and evil stalks the Texas hills with the easy nonchalant grace of the antelope he hunts.  Happening upon a drug deal gone wrong and the ultimate riches-of-the-city temptation--a valise filled with money that could enrich his life with his pretty little wife (Kelly Macdonald) 2.4 million-fold, he catapults into a plan that Sheriff Bell realizes from afar will take him down.  Most of the film's action follows Moss as he attempts to outsmart the devil incarnate (the tenacious Bardem sporting a haircut reminiscent of a dark-side 70s Gerard Depardieu and his weapon of choice--a nasty little dehumanizing compressed-air-mechanized stun gun used to kill cattle.)  Minor characters pop up like targets in an arcade shooting game--mere examples of the genuine coldness of this killer and the Coen brothers' penchant for over-the-top, gory, eye-popping brutality that almost desensitizes the audience like an overexposure to the horrific behavior of Hannibal Lecter in the three Thomas Harris inspired films.<br /><br />Not only do the Coen brothers enjoy a good blood bath, they take pleasure in bitter twists of irony.  Greed motivates the good guy--Moss fights tooth and nail to keep tainted money and jeopardize his wife's security--while a bald honesty holds bad guy Chigurh in check; the strange Anton allows his victims a choice by which he religiously stands.  Oddly, for him, a promise made becomes a promise kept.<br /><br />In terms of performance, the workings of all three of the major roles here border on what seems an effortless genius.  In particular, Bardem enthralls each and every time he enters a scene wielding that oxymoronic brand of macabre attraction and repulsion is reminiscent of Anthony Hopkin's skill in portraying the murderous cannibal in "The Silence of the Lambs." Brolin forges headfirst--his would-be sheep-for-the-slaughter a veritable thinking machine of non-stop action.  Jones brings all his wryness to this role--the character Bell seems written specifically to display the adeptness of his acting ability.<br /><br />Bottom line?  "No Country for Old Men" is not intended for a general audience--so parents think twice about bringing children into the theatre to see this one.  The images of bloody brutality come swiftly with little warning--I spent much of the time squeezing my eyes shut to avoid the virtual spatter of blood.  Otherwise, the film, seemingly an allegory for the eternal battle between good and evil extends beyond the obvious clouding over with nihilistic predetermination while presenting a world where conditioning to the nastier aspects of life renders all that blood-letting mere accoutrements meant to entertain rather than horrify.  Fascinating and highly recommended.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />"reneofc"</p></body></html>

Harold and Kumar seem a bit old for their high schoolish behaviour.  As of films forementioned, and even like classics like "Ferris Buellers Day Off," Harold is the reluctant friend who is dragged along on Kumars antics.  There trip to White Castles is thwarted when they find out that their beloved White Castles closed down years prior.  So the road trip to the White Castles in Cherry Hill begins (coincidently when I lived in South Jersey I loved visiting a White Castles but I think that was in Pennsauken but maybe it was Cherry Hill).  Kumar is all about getting high, and scoring with hot chicks. Harold is into his work and seemingly reluctant to the evenings adventures. He has a sensitive side, "Pretty In Pink" is his favorite movie.  The fact that they are Asian and Indian really is a non issue because Kumar especially acts like a suburban raised white guy. Like alot of other stoner/teen movies, Kumar's dad expects a lot of him and his dad pressures him to go to medical school and not be such a slacker.  I guess the point is to prove that Asian Americans and Indian Americans cool too.  The film is funny at points but it's also quite ridiculous and it's not supposed to make much sense.  It's an okay film I guess, but trust me, you've seen all of this before.</p></body></html>

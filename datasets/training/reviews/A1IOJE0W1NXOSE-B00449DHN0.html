<meta name="summary" content="Overlong and underwhelming"></head><body><p>This film shows the violence which was prevalent in New York in the mid-1800's.  &quot;Native&quot; Americans are pitted against the immigrant Irish and men being drafted into the Union army rebel against joining a war that they care little about.  There is plenty of fighting and plenty of blood.  The conflicts are personified by Leonardo DiCaprio who swears vengeance on the man who killed his father when he was a young boy and left him to be brought up in an orphanage.  As a grown man he seemingly joins the man they call The Butcher, while plotting his death.  Cameron Diaz is the love interest who leaves The Butcher to join DiCaprio.  This is a dark film, both visually and content-wise and it will probably not be taken as seriously by viewers as the film-makers might wish.</p></body></html>

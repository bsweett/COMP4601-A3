<meta name="summary" content="Fairy tale or morality tale"></head><body><p>Long past due for viewing on my list, partially due to mixed reviews, I finally made it to watch this movie.  It is part fairy tale, with beautiful visual effects, but also a morality tale for disillusioned adults. Translucent Bryce Dallas Howard, brings to us a mythical lady whose unusual appearance in the apartment complex wakes up its tenants from their mundane if not unhappy lives.  Her presence gives them all new purpose - which while not clear to any one of them at first - still keeps them together in their efforts to help an enigmatic stranger.  They all find talents and purpose they could not see in themselves before and they act as "band of brother" -just trying to do the right thing.  Paul Giamatti brings wonderful performance that is both delightful and hillarious at times.  Writer/director Shyamalan is expressing himself as an artist of wide range, not just a capable director.  There is a lot of talent in this young man, he should let it grow at it's own pace and not rush it.  That way his next work will in fact earn 5 stars instead of 4 (like this one).</p></body></html>

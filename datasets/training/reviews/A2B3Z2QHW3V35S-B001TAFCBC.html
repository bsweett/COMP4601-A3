This is the kind of movie you need to pay attention to from the beginning till the end, so you can understand it. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are boyfriend and girlfriend who had a falling out. Kate is going threw so much pain that she decides to erase Jim from her mind. After Jim finds out he try's to do the same.<br /><br />Asleep in his home two man are erasing her from his mind. While he is losing memories of her he decides he wants to keep them. So he is running around in his memories with her trying to hide her in place where he thinks they wont be able to erase her. When he wakes up she is gone. but surprisingly they find each other again and are back in each others life's. I've been told that everyone who is in your life now were part of your past life. And will be part of your next life. So there is really no point on erasing the hurt. It just comes back again.</p></body></html>

The Hannibal character in this film/story was much too far along in age... was he six, or seven?... to have been vulnerable to the mind-warping machinations which produce psychopathic behavior toward others.  It was attempted in the story to show that he had no feelings, as when he registered nothing on the lie-detector test, and the French police detective said that the "human" part of Lecter had died in the snow, when he was found by Russian soldiers.<br /><br />It's feasible that the character would want revenge for seeing his sister murdered and cannibalized, but ordinarily that would not make him demented toward other people... not to the extent that one becomes a regular serial killer.<br /><br />I think Thomas Harris dropped the ball with his Hannibal origins.  His book "Red Dragon" was actually the best tale in the series, with the best plot and characterization.  The rest has been entertaining, but the rest has all lacked the same depth as the book "Red Dragon" exhibited.</p></body></html>

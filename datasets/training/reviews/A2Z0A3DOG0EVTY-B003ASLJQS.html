<meta name="summary" content="A Powerful Modern Classic!!"></head><body><p>My Fianc&eacute; and I like to watch LAW AND ORDER on TV.  She spends the whole episode trying to figure it out the mystery.  I watch the opening moments, meet all the characters, and think about it for a moment and of course I call the outcome 90% of the time.  It doesn't mean that I don't enjoy sitting through a good mystery.  It's just after a while it becomes more difficult for me not to figure out what happens in the end.<p>That's the problem I had with Clint Eastwood's (Blood Work) new film MYSTIC RIVER. It's a riveting and tense thriller, it's one of the best films of year and of course I went and ruined it for myself by figuring out the outcome about an hour before the movie ended.  Was it the "Old Economy of Characters" that made it so easy? Not really!  I think it's just the film has one logical ending and if you miss the clues you'll kick yourself in the head.<p>The story follows three friends in South Boston.  They are Jimmy (Sean Penn, I Am Sam), Dave (Tim Robbins, Bob Roberts), and Sean (Kevin Bacon, Wild Things).  As kids, Dave was kidnapped and raped by some guys dressed liked cops, they kept him in a dirty cellar for four years until he escaped. He got home but he never quite recovered.  Jimmy grew up to be a petty thief, served two years in prison, and is now a legitimate shopkeeper is his neighborhood, and Sean is now a detective with a marriage that's almost non-existent.  These three friends are forced to come to grips with their friendship when Jimmy's daughter (Emmy Rossum, Songcatcher) winds up murdered.  <p>MYSTIC RIVER is about the sins of our past, mistaken identities, and those small moments that change our lives forever.  It's about what ties us all together, how we face our demons, and the bonds of friendship and family.  It's also about flawed people forced to face the demons.  It's probably the best-acted film I've seen all year.<p>Sean Penn gives the performance of a lifetime.  I finally forgive him for the travesty that was I AM SAM and I'm hoping that he moves on as well.  There is a powerful moment, as he must tell his wife (Laura Linney, The Life of David Gale) that his daughter (From a first marriage) is dead.  The two of them look at each other for a moment and then embrace.  This kind of scene is very rarely powerful, in most films it's almost laughable, but all I could think was "Wow!"  For once it wasn't mucked up.  For once a director allowed raw power to move a scene and not harsh swelling music.<p>Clint Eastwood has proved once again that with the right material he can direct a film that is smart and well told.  He has a very shaky track record, for every UNFORGIVEN, there are messes like TRUE CRIME and BLOOD WORK.  MYSTIC RIVER is better than UNFORGIVEN, but these two films will be considered classics.<p>I liked MYSTIC RIVER.  I liked how it unfolded.  I just wish I could have shut my brain down because I hate it when I call the end of a good mystery.  It reminded me of the moment when I called the end of THE OTHERS.  Of course I loved the film, but I felt cheated by my own cleverness.  I sometimes wish I could enjoy a movie like the masses.  But since I can't,  I will sing MYSTIC RIVER'S praises, and beseech the Academy to nominate Penn for this performance, he deserves it.<p>So, If you're looking for a taught thriller with lots of mystery give MYSTIC RIVER a chance.  It's well worth two hours of your time.<p>****1/2  (out of 5)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Well..."></head><body><p>I am still not sure what to think of this movie. Let's look at some aspects.<p>Acting: no really worth mentioning, except maybe Nick Nolte.<br />SFXs: The Hulk is of course a fantastic piece of special effects. It's hard to believe it's entirely CGI.<br />Dialogue: Even Star Wars is better<br />Believability: Jumping for miles? going into space? no seriously, the old hulk was in some strange way believable.<p>Not a good movie, think I'm gonna watch Lee's 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' again. That movie still blows me away. The Hulk certainly did not.</p></body></html>

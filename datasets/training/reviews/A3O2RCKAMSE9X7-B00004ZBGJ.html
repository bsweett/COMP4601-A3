<meta name="summary" content="Planet of the Apes: A Film of Images & Irony"></head><body><p>The impact of PLANET OF THE APES has unfortunately suffered a diminution because of the inferior sequels and a cartoonish television series.  Nevertheless the original still resonates in ways that even now does not lose power after multiple viewings.  Director Franklin Schaffner took a literate script from Rod Serling, who in turn adapted the monkey planet tale from Pierre Boulle, and brought to the screen a world turned upside down.  In both the novel and the script, an astronaut (Charlton Heston) crashes his spacecraft on a world that he believes lies hundreds of light years from earth only to discover that it is apes who rule and human beings who serve.  The plot, which details Heston's attempt to understand how this monkey ruling society could have evolved, allows Director Franklin both to entertain and to instruct.  The entertaining aspect is connected to an often biting and humorous didacticism that pokes a not so gentle thrust at an anti-war, post-hippie society that was contemporary with the film's release date of 1968.  The tri-part ape society of gorilla, chimpanzee, and monkey correspond to the pro-war military, the educated elite, and the silent majority respectively.  Just as human society was rent by internal dissent during the Vietnam War so is simian society equally divisive due to the heavy handed way the gorillas run roughshod over the chimps and monkeys.  The impact of PLANET OF THE APES inheres in a very nearly seamless melding of sight to sound.  At the start of the film, Heston and two other earth astronauts are forced to wander this new world and are greeted first by an inhospitable desert, then by thieving humans, and then finally by brute gorillas who round up the humans in images of white slave catchers recapturing runaway black slaves.  The scene involving the imprisoning of the humans still shocks in intensity, even after more than three decades.  Later, other and similar scenes set up the beach finale that indicates at what point human society began to wither and simian society began to be ascendant.  Much of the dialogue is rife with irony and wit that when spoken by apes about humans richly suggests the folly of ethnic egotism that is apparently not limited to humans alone.  <p>Heston's supporting cast is capable and even classically trained.  Maurice Evans as the ape leader mouths platitudes with the certainty of a wounded Lear as he tries mightily to grasp why his own kind are taking the side of the humans.  Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter are kindly scientists who can see that Heston is far more than the mutated freak that the gorilla leaders hold him to be.  And then there is the obligatory piece of female eye candy, fetchingly played by Linda Harrison, as Heston's love interest.  What PLANET OF THE APES points out is that if our contemporary human society suffers from mutually assured destruction, then the survivors may be indistinguishable from the brutish laws of a future ruling simian one.</p></body></html>

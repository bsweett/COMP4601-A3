<meta name="summary" content="Five not-so-easy pieces"></head><body><p>Don Johnston, the main character of "Broken Flowers," is a guy who has apparently made a fortune in computers, yet doesn't actually have a PC in his home.<br /><br />He's played by Bill Murray, and the movie opens at a point in his life when he is content to just sit in front of his large-screen TV or zone out to music all day while his large, pale house settles around him.<br /><br />When his latest girlfriend leaves him, he simply shifts from a sitting to a reclining position on the couch.<br /><br />But then he gets a mysterious letter from an anonymous ex; it informs him that he has a 19-year-old son who may be trying to find him.<br /><br />His neighbor, Winston (Jeffrey Wright), eagerly sees this as a mystery to solve -- surely it shouldn't be too hard to track down the boy's mother -- so he puts together a dossier for Don's investigation (complete with rental car reservations, profiles of Don's four former lovers, Mapquest directions to their homes and a handy CD of Ethiopian jazz) and sends him on his way.<br /><br />Most of the rest of the movie involves Don's very different reunions with a quartet of very different ex-girlfriends (played by Sharon Stone, Jessica Lange, Tilda Swinton and Frances Conroy).<br /><br />Going into "Flowers," though, I wondered if Murray really should play yet another glib, vaguely-depressed-but-funny middle-aged guy not unlike his characters in "Rushmore," "The Life Aquatic" and "Lost in Translation." I'm a fan of him and of those movies, but they tended to frustrate as many people as they delighted, and seeing Murray stare down another midlife crisis almost feels like watching Billy Bob Thornton play another surly drunk or Angelina Jolie play another femme fatale.<br /><br />He gets away with it again, though, and "Flowers" is, again, one of those movies that will please some greatly and absolutely confound others.<br /><br />That split is largely the result of writer-director Jim Jarmusch, who specializes in movies that would march to the beat of a different drummer if they actually chose to march at all. His films ("Stranger Than Paradise," "Coffee and Cigarettes") are comedies that tend to elicit lots of wry smiles instead of huge belly laughs. Low on plot, they move at their own steady pace.<br /><br />"Flowers" is no exception and it certainly takes its time; it's also a wise, funny and eventually very moving little film, with a script that carefully lets viewers answer some of the story's questions on their own. There's also a lot of fine acting, especially from Wright, who's extremely funny, and Lange, who's quite frightening; but this is mostly Murray's show and even if it feels a little like material he's covered before.</p></body></html>

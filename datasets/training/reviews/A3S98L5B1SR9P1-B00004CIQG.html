Sellers, in his 3 roles, has you on the floor laughing. Surprisingly, so does Scott. The film scenes are realistic with tight spaces or documentary-worthy war footage. The acting is great. The directing is phenomenol. There is not a single bad thing about this movie. The ending is comical and very, very dark. I could watch this movie daily and not be tired of it.</p></body></html>

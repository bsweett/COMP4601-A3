<meta name="summary" content="It's worth seeing once, but it fails to reach its massive potential..."></head><body><p>Ever since seeing `Gladiator' I have been obsessed with the swords-and-sandals epics.  Sadly there hasn't been a film since to really capture all that `Gladiator' was able to capture.  That said, I had really high hopes for `Alexander'.  Oliver Stone is truly a visionary director, if not highly misunderstood.  Some of his films reach levels of greatness (`Natural Born Killers') while others are overshot even for him and fail miserably (`World Trade Center').  `Alexander' falls somewhere in the middle.  It has moments of superbly crafted greatness, yet it has many other moments of meandering mediocrity.  The cast is filled to the brim with big names, yet it is the smallest names that work the best here, and while the film is shot with a truly epic scope it fails to embrace the gritty grandeur that is the very definition of `epic'.<br /><br />Telling the story of Alexander the Great and his rise to power is a hefty assignment.  He's on of the most recognizable faces in World History and his story is one of the most interesting and commanding.  Alexander truly defined the word `great' and his life should lead to one fantastic film.  Sadly Stone doesn't seem to really grasp all that could be had here.  He sees facets of Alexander's life, facets mostly unknown to the American public, and attempts to uncover them and them alone in a way of `enlightening' us.  The problem is that the most memorable and interesting parts of Alexander's life are thus left barely breached.  First and foremost Alexander was a warrior, a leader, a man who conquered the known world at the young age of thirty.  `Alexander' the film never really fleshes out this warrior in him.  The opening line in the film refers to Alexander as a god; but the film never gives us any reason to think so.<br /><br />The action sequences, while decent, are really just that; decent.  I expected so much more from these (especially when word got out about the elephants) but I was disappointed at the amount of confusion these battles led to.  They are choppy and hard to follow.  Another area of complaint was the sets themselves.  While they looked authentic to a degree, everything seemed `too' authentic; if that makes any sense.  Especially in the scenes involving Old Ptolemy (played by Anthony Hopkins); I just felt like I was in a museum.<br /><br />The acting is also a sore spot.  Much has been said in regards to Angelina's poor accent, and while it didn't bother me to the extent that it bothered critics, it really was terrible.  Val Kilmer was atrocious here, and Anthony Hopkins was easily forgettable, which is very uncommon for him.  Jared Leto plays Hephaistion horrifically.  It's sad because his character could have been marvelously portrayed.  It's such a baity role; male lover, friend and advisor to the king; but instead he plays him so subdued and brittle you would never get the impression he was a warrior alongside the king.  He's too much of a badly portrayed stereotype if you get my drift.<br /><br />Colin Farrell on the other hand scores well here.  Many critics balked at his portrayal of the doomed king, but I actually think that Farrell did a superb job.  He goes through so many emotions it would have been easy for any actor to get lost in them and fumble through them so-to-speak but Colin maneuvers himself through this cast array of emotions effortlessly.  I was stunned at his presence.  I have been watching him for a while now and have been so happy with his steady rise in the ranks.  Films like `Tigerland', `Phone Booth' and `Alexander' show what this guy is capable of.  Rosario Dawson also delivers a well crafted performance.  As Roxane, Alexander's bride, she captures her raw exotic persona that made her the woman she was.  While Stone makes it a point to rest Alexander's heart in the hands of men we are able to get a glimpse of the passion Roxane sparked within his soul despite his extramarital longings.<br /><br />One area I can give it the greatest of praise though is the score, which elevates the film in a way and delivers a marvelous tone and mood.  It's beautiful in every way possible.<br /><br />Like I mentioned on the outset; there are moments here that work very well.  This has to do with Farrell's dedication and determination to make it work.  There are just too many moments that don't work for this to be considered a great film, or even a good one.  It moves very slowly in scenes, and while I enjoy a slow-moving character study as much as the next `quote-unquote' critic, I still like to be interested in the subject.  `Alexander' moves at such a pace that it loses the audience in many places.  Oliver Stone might have undershot this one, not taking it to the places it could have gone.  He really could have gone there, taken it to that next level.  With a subject like Alexander the Great you almost have the responsibility to make it big and bold but sadly for the most part `Alexander' is long and dull and uneventful.</p></body></html>

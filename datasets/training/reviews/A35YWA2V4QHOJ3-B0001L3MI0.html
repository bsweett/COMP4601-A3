It most certainly has some of the best special effects I have ever seen.  It's kind of like a remake of a 1950s movie with an updated SF package.<p>Will Smith is certainly not my favorite actor, but he turns in a suprisingly strong performance as a Marine fighter pilot ace.  Bill Pulman is a likeable, youthfull president who was a fighter pilot himself during Desert Storm.  [Now, class, 3 guesses as to why the writers put in the President of the United States as a former fighter pilot, please.  Could it be that they want the President himself to go ballistic on some aliens, maybe?].  <p>The one fatal flaw of this movie is that it is unbelievable to anyone who has ever been in the military, or knows anything at all about the military.  These huge, 5 mile long flying saucers come to earth, and apparently all the military has to use against them are air-to-air missiles and nuclear bombs.  Excuse me?  I would think that there would be stuff in-between sidewinders and Nuclear missiles that we could fire at these nasty aliens....I mean, trying to knock  a gargantuan alien mothership out of the sky with sidewinders is a bit like trying to knock out George Foreman using nothing but jabs.<p>Anyway, word has it that the military was excited about collaborating with this film project, just as they have done with movies such as "Crimson Tide," "The Rock" and many others.  However, a glitch came up when the military advisors learned that some of the movie was to concentrate on all of the mythology / hoopla behind the infamous "Area 51."  I'm sure everyone is aware of those rumours, so there is no reason to go into them.  Anyway, as soon as the Brass learned about this, the military washed its hands of the project.  So, what you end up with is basically what the original writers seemed to be looking for:  a cross between "Star Wars" and "Top Gun."  <p>That said, this movie does pass as good eye candy.  I just hope that, if there ever really is an alien invasion, we don't try & shoot down UFOs using the weakest weapons in our arsenal.  8-)</p></body></html>

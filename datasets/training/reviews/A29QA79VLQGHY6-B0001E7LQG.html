<meta name="summary" content="Jack and Diane -- a nice pair"></head><body><p>Oscar nominee Diane Keaton stars with her old friend Jack Nicholson in the film about learning to play with kids your own age. A test disc looked fine despite speckles here and there. Audio was just OK. Director Nancy Meyers does separate commentary tracks with her two stars. Keaton doesn't start talking until 40 minutes into the movie (until her brief nude scene has safely passed). "That's a fiction!" Keaton says at one point, as her character walks toward the camera, gorgeous and dressed to kill. "It is you -- there are no special effects," Meyers assures the famously shy actress. Fans of Keaton and Nicholson will get a kick out of comparing the actors' comments about their extended lovemaking scene. Keaton talks mostly about how embarrassed she was -- Nicholson is so precise about the acting techniques he used it seems as if he's pulling our legs.</p></body></html>

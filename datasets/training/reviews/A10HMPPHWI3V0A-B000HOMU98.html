Personally I find all eight of those films good even though "Lolita" and "Eye's Wide Shut" dont have half of the goods of the other six. Five of his eight films are all about the same, they are all near perfection. Those include "A Clockwork Orange", "The Shining", 2001: A Space Odyssey", "Dr. Strangelove" and the one at hand "Full Metal Jacket". I think that all eight of his films are worth seeing but those five you simply cant die until you see.<br /><br />This may seem a bit weird but I found "Full Metal Jacket" to be just as scary as Kubrick's "The Shining". Even though there is really only one scene in "Full Metal Jacket" that can be considered scary, the transformation of the "...unfortunate" man into what he becomes is frightening as well. The thing that I really loved about this movie is that it feels like you watch two short films in one movie. Not only do you watch Joker, Leonard, Sargent Hartman & the other men go threw Boot Camp but you also get to watch as Joker enter's the actual war (Veitnam). You continuously see the effects that the war has on the people fighting as well as an ending that keeps you fully involved to say the least.<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick's Directoral habits (I use habit's in a good way...) and tendencys are fully apparent. The screenplay is flawless. The acting is all around great. The Visuals are unforgetable. The film has a deep impact that you will never forget. "Full Metal Jacket" is an absolute spectacular display of film-making at it's finest!<br /><br />Grade: A</p></body></html>

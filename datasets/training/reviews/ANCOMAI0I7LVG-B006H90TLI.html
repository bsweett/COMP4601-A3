It's become so over praised that one walks into it expected the second coming, and for many that is just not what they are going to witness.<br /><br />But I urge you to pay close attention...because this movie is much more than you may think.<br /><br />`No Country...' is a very well rounded and extremely well crafted thriller that never lets go of its unnerving pace and opens itself up for an intriguing study of humanity at its worst.  It's a very, very good movie; a great movie at that; one that you will thoroughly enjoy and want to revisit time and time again.<br /><br />The film follows Llewelyn Moss, an army vet who just so happens to stubble upon some drug money.  Fully aware of the danger he's subjecting himself and his wife to he decides to take the money and run.  What he doesn't realize is that the man responsible for the `danger' is not anything Llewelyn will be able to stand against.  Anton Chigurh is death; plain and simple.  Chigurh pursues Llewelyn with reckless abandon while Moss' wife Carla Jean tries to keep a level head about the whole episode.  Llewelyn is also being pursued by the local Sheriff, Ed Tom Bell; an old timer who has just about had enough of what this `country' has turned into.<br /><br />What helps elevate this film from standard thriller to exceptional cinema is the masterful cast; from the actors to the directors.  Everyone involved in this film delivers top notch.  Josh Brolin has been tampering with fame for a long time now and finally he's starred in something to be proud of.  His portrayal of Llewelyn Moss is fantastically tempered and controlled.  Tommy Lee Jones is also marvelous here.  This is how I like my Jones; raw and emotionally crippled.  He plays the down trodden `thinker' extremely well.  Kelly Macdonald is flawless here, utterly flawless.  She serves as a beating heart in a film filled to the brim with apathy.<br /><br />The film though belongs to Javier Bardem.  Everything that has been said about this man and his performance is true.  He is commanding and relentlessly savage.  There's a grin that appears on his face often within this film, a grin that gives way to his menacing insanity; a grimace that cements the character of Anton Chigurh in our minds forever.  While I won't be one to say that Chigurh is as masterful a creation as Hannibal Lecter I will say that he is one of the most memorable and interesting villains ever to appear on the big screen.<br /><br />I will say that there is no way that Bardem is `supporting' in this film for he has more screen time then any other actor and really, in the end, the film is all about him.<br /><br />Joel and Ethan Coen masterfully wade through Cormac McCarthy's orgasmic novel and deliver a very faithful adaptation.  Having just recently read the novel myself I was floored at how accurate a translation this film proved to be.  That said, there are two scenes within the novel; my two favorite scenes at that; that were not represented well here.  The first is not even part of the movie, and that is when Llewelyn picks up a young hitchhiker.  They have a very deep and moving conversation that engrossed me so much that I was disappointed to see it completely snubbed here.  The second is that of Carla Jean and Anton's unfortunate meeting.  That meeting is here in the film, and it is probably the most moving scene in the film, but it's not given the attention it deserved.  In the novel the scene is a little more lengthy and it's `completed'; here, in the film, it's left a little too `wide open'.<br /><br />Those two issues are not enough to really complain about for the film is so smooth and so masterfully constructed that those minor squabbles are easily forgiven.<br /><br />The Coen's have built a well oiled and hard working machine that offers the audience a `complete' experience.  This is not a film built on mere acting or a well written script.  It is a film that has those two things and then some.  The film is a marvel to watch.  The cinematography, while not showy, is commanding and awe inspiring.  It captures the mood and emotion that this film sets out to create.  The editing of this film is probably the finest I've seen all year.  It's such a smooth ride; each scene masterfully running into the next.  Another thing I appreciated is the lack of score here.  I love a good score, but what the Coen's have done here was allow the film to speak for itself.  The silence is unsettling and it forces the audience to fall inside the events on screen.  This also allows us to truly pay attention to the small details; the footsteps, gun clicks and heavy breathing; all of which heighten the intensity of the film.<br /><br />On the outset, `No Country for Old Men' may seem like an above average thriller; but there is so much more to this film then drugs, money and murder.  Sure, it is not flawless but it's a film that is perfectly flawed, in that its flaws seem to embellish its beauty.  The characters are walking flaws; the situation is a huge flaw; its reasoning is flawed, but in the end those flaws equal one amazing experience for they expose the imperfection that is this `country'.</p></body></html>

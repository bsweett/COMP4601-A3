<meta name="summary" content="Rambo is back and better than ever"></head><body><p>After the success of Rocky in 1976, Stallone would have a character that would go down in cinema history and went onto become one of the biggest stars in the world. In 1982 with the release of First Blood, John Rambo would join Rocky as yet another Iconic character for Stallone.<br /><br />But there came a time when all things must end; the 2nd Rambo flick was a blockbuster hit and made a total of $150-million dollars in 1985 it's almost like everyone in the US went to see the movie, but despite the popularity of the character Rambo III would only gross about $53-million and would put an end to the series. Even Rocky V would be a flop in 1990 and it seemed these two Iconic characters were done for.<br /><br />Sly would have success and failures, but by the end of the 90s it seemed like a lot more failures with some of his movies even going DTV. Once the biggest action star, it seemed Sly was a thing of the past, but that all changed with Rocky Balboa; a lot of people were laughing at a 60-year old Stallone playing that character again, but the movie was a hit and nobody was laughing after they saw Stallone could still pull it off. With the success of Rocky Balboa, Sly was now ready to resurrect John Rambo. There were still some people laughing due to his age, but there's that saying age is just a number and Stallone proved that.<br /><br />At the time of Rambo's release, Stallone was 61-years old and I'll take Stallone in his 60s over any of these so called action stars out there right now that are half of Stallone's age. Rambo is the return of the action movie as we know it. I can't remember the last American action that was this good besides Kill Bill. Rambo is as good as an action movie any country could produce for that matter. The last American action movie that is just as good if not better than Rambo was back in probably the 80s or early 90s.<br /><br />The screenplay was written by Art Monterastelli & Sylvester Stallone and while the screenplay is good the supporting characters aren't really well developed, but I suppose it doesn't matter seeing as it doesn't hurt the movie and I don't think anyone watches a Rambo flick for the supporting characters we watch them for the Rambo character. While the script isn't the best it delivers on what the audience wants. And really at the end of the day isn't that all that matters?<br /><br />Sylvester Stallone knows what his audience wants and a lot of people don't realize that he wrote or co-wrote a lot of the movies he starred in; odds are the movies he co-wrote he did rewrites to better suit the script for his style. While I wouldn't say Sly is a great writer in the traditional sense he's a guy that knows what his audience wants and delivers that. Though with Rocky and Rocky Balboa, Sly showed how he can also be a great writer and was actually nominated for an Oscar for the Rocky screenplay, which he easily could have won.<br /><br />Sly also steps into the director's chair for the first time in this franchise and wow does he ever deliver. Stallone has many directing credits, but like his writing I wouldn't call Sly a great director in the traditional sense. Again Sly knows what his audience wants and he always manages to deliver just that. If anything though I really think Sly is getting better with age, which is rare. Most filmmakers as they go on they lose touch with the modern audience, but not Sly. I think with Rocky Balboa he proved he can make a great dramatic, funny and even touching movie and with Rambo he made an action movie as good as any action filmmaker has ever done. Rambo is suspenseful, thrilling and has some of the best action scenes I have seen in a very long time.<br /><br />Rambo is a borderline exploitation flick in my opinion; the violence is actually quite extreme for a mainstream movie and for a movie rated R. Nobody is Rambo is safe; men, women and even children are murdered. This isn't a toned down Hollywood action flick. This is a balls to the wall no holds barred brutal movie. You name it Rambo has it; decapitations, throats being ripped out, people getting shot and they just don't fall down and die they get ripped to shreds; arms, legs you name it, it gets shot off.<br /><br />The running time for Rambo is only 80-minutes not counting the closing credits so there never is a slow moment. The movie always moves forward. Rambo is light on plot, but hey that's the way a lot of action movies are. Rambo easily for me rates as one of the best theater going experiences of my life and the movie on DVD is just as exciting. This one is no doubt one of my very favorite action movies of all time and once again Sly shows age is just a number. Rambo has everything you can want in an action movie and more.</p></body></html>

Now before we start breaking out into song, let's focus on what the Christmas holiday means to all of us. For younger children, this is the time to be away from school and enjoy all the wonderful presents they have begged Santa for over the past four to five weeks. For the more adult crowd (at least most of them), Christmas is the time to gather with family and friends, swap stories and memories, and hope they don't get a necktie or socks as a gift. The festive yuletide season is also the time when the greatest films of all time are shown across millions of televisions sets across the country and possibly the world as well. You have your comedies like A Christmas Story and Christmas Vacation, the cartoon treasures such as A Charlie Brown Christmas and How the Grinch Stole Christmas, and those delightful classics like White Christmas and The Bishop's Wife. But none of these can hold a candle to Frank Capra enduring theatrical triumph, It's a Wonderful Life. Amazingly the feature wasn't considered a Christmas film until its repetitive showings in the 1970's when the copyright on the film went up. Now it is basically considered a near crime for this film not to be seen at least during this festive time of year. Quite amazing to see how a total box office dud can rise over the years to be not only the greatest Christmas film but one of the most enduring classics of all time.<p>The story follows a man who is at the end of his rope and how he discovers that he really has bigger purpose in life then he had originally thought. George Bailey is a good man who has never accomplished the goals he once set for himself as a young boy. Growing up in the little town of Bedford Falls, George dreamed of venturing out into the world and visiting many different and exotic places without a care for anybody else but himself. Unfortunately luck does not seem to be on his side as every opportunity he has to escape the little town ends with him in the same place he has been for all of his life while others get to enjoy the life George wishes he had. Now in charge of his father's loan office, George Bailey faces one of the greatest challenges of his life. Uncle Billy has lost the $8,000 that the loan office carried and Mr. Potter, the richest and stingiest man in town, has issued a warrant for his arrest. George now contemplates taking his own life until his guardian angel shows him the world as if he was never born and it's a more frightening situation then he had ever imagined. The story for It's a Wonderful Life is quite a simple premise and yet it has to be one of the most inspiring and insightful plots in motion picture history. No other film in recent memory can claim it has pulled off the same premise as wonderfully as Capra's classic has.<p>Though there are many memorable performances in It's Wonderful Life, the overall emotional support lies on the performance of only one man, James Stewart. It was once said of director Frank Capra that Stewart was his first and only choice for the role of George Bailey and that shows in his emotionally driven performance in the two hour feature. Jimmy Stewart showcases a wide range of expresses from his frustration when Uncle Billy loses the money, till exasperation when he stands at the bridge contemplating whether to kill himself or not, to his exuberance at discovering he is able to live once again. James Stewart has to be one of the most treasured performers ever to come across the silver screen and no more so then in this film. What makes this feature even more special is the fact that this was the performer's first feature film since coming back from his service in World War II. Jimmy Stewart should be revered not only for his dedication to his profession but to his country as well.<p>Overall, It's a Wonderful Life's message of necessity and good nature of man kind rings no harder in the minds of movie-goers then it does today. Plenty of classic holiday films have come along over the years including such favorites as The Santa Clause, The Grinch, and the recent smash-hit, Elf, but none of them can ever come close to the staying power of Frank Capra's crowning achievement. The truth is that the messages expressed in the film go way beyond the holiday season and can be enjoyed during any time of the year with as great of amount of enthusiasm as if the Christmas spirit was all around. Granted the film has been labeled overly-sentimental but if anything that is more a greater compliment then anything else one can say about one the true treasures in cinematic history.</p></body></html>

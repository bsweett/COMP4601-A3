<meta name="summary" content="So bad it's good"></head><body><p>Steve Miner, who directed the lackluster second installment of the Friday the 13th franchise, returned to the director's chair for this third installment, originally filmed in 3-D which would explain the never ending slew of eyeballs, pitchforks, harpoons, yo-yo's, popcorn, snakes, that are thrown directly in the viewer's direction.  The acting is as crummy as crummy can be, but this installment offers the goods: good looking babes who get down and dirty, and some great blood and gore effects.  This may feature some of the most brutal killings in the series until Jason Goes to Hell came along, but this installment is pivotal for one reason: Jason finally ditches his potato sack and dons the trademark hockey mask.  All in all, Friday the 13th Part 3 is better than the preceding Part 2, and would set the stage for what I feel is the best film in the series: Friday the 13th Part 4: The Final Chapter.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The original and best - paranoia  , chills and friendship"></head><body><p>As many film fans would be aware , this film has recently been remade . We are seeing that a lot lately . I cannot think of a reason to do it with an original as good as this . The only good thing about it will be if it makes some viewers discover the first film .<br /><br />The director was blessed with a great script and a great cast .<br /><br />The film also leaves some questions unanswered - is Janet Leigh what she seems ?<br /><br />The friendship between Frank Sinatra and Laurence Harvey is unlikely and doomed , but the mounting desperation keeps you hanging on wondering what will happen - you piece it together as the film unwinds .<br /><br />This is a film with a pervasive sense of evil and foreboding to it . If you like it , I recommend one of John Frankenheimer's other films , SECONDS .<br /><br />You will never look at a pack of playing cards the same way again . Highly recommended !!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="You know, I've always loved this movie.  I must have bought it in various formats at least 6 times"></head><body><p>This is one of those movies where you don't have to be religious to enjoy a story with religious intentions.<br /><br />Batman, Superman, Spiderman, Moses.  Every good story has a great hero, so why not Ben-Hur?<br /><br />And, of course, every good story has a common enemy.  Nazis, Al-Qaeda, The Riddler, and even Darth Vader.  So here, Ben-Hur had to compete with the sinister Roman named Masala, to protect his God fearing people, and to even prove his innocence of a misfortunate event that evidently lead to persecute himself and his mother and sister.<br /><br />But, I couldn't believe how expensive this Blu-ray release was for Ben-Hur this time around.  And now that I've received it from Amazon, I'm rather overwhelmed by the packaging of the film.  This box is a shelf-consuming Monstrosity!<br /><br />This big-a$$ box has three discs, one of which is full of special features that I'd probably only watch once. Plus it comes with two books.  Who needs these stupid books?  I scanned through one of them and found that it's just a bunch of written breakdowns of the days of filming.  How freakin' boring!  And, this whole big box weighs about 6 pounds and I don't know where to put it in my Blu-Ray collection.  It's a huge eye-sore!  I hope they'll release this movie as ONLY the movie at a much reduced price, and that it fits in with my other BD discs.  Or, if I just keep this huge box, I can just use it as a door stop, or a support block to hold my window open, or if I stand it upside, this could be used as an extra seat at the dinner table when I have company.<br /><br />What a bunch of unnecessary info-stock fodder that I got stuck with, that I had to pay for, when all I wanted was just the movie itself in Blu-ray.  I'm surprised that this box didn't also include an imitation leather whip with Masala's name on it, which I'm sure some hardcore movie collector would cherish and hang on their wall above their TV set, or just keep it in its original wrapper and keep the whole box set honorably intact, and displayed on some mantle.<br /><br />Now, I'm hearing from people that this movie is available as a single disc version at Best Buy.  So, I guess I ordered this movie too soon from Amazon.<br /><br />Oh well, live and learn.</p></body></html>

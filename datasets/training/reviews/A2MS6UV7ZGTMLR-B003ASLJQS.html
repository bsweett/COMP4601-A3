<meta name="summary" content="A Powerful Movie"></head><body><p>Mystic River opens in a dreary lower middle-class suburb of Boston in the 1970s, where 3 young friends, Jimmy, Sean and Dave are killing time just being boys, playing street hockey and getting up to minor mischief. One of them, Dave, is then kidnapped in front of his friends, by a pair of child molesters masquerading as plainclothes police. We then learn that he escaped from their clutches after four days of sexual abuse at their hands, but was obviously deeply scarred mentally. The film then flashes forward to the same area, but in the present day.<br /><br />The three guys, though they have drifted apart, are still living in the same neighbourhood. The daughter of one of the three, Jimmy Markum, played by Sean Penn (I am Sam, Thin Red Line, Dead Man Walking), has been murdered recently. One of the other three, Sean, played by Kevin Bacon (Footloose, Flatliners, Hollow Man) is the investigating police officer. The remaining member of the trio, Dave, played by Tim Robbins (Shawshank Redemption, Arlington Rd) is the prime suspect in the case.<br /><br />Mystic River is a good, old-fashioned murder mystery in which the tension and plot thickens effectively over the duration of the film. There are plenty of plot twists and red herrings to keep the viewer guessing till the last few minutes. The film is ably directed by the great Clint Eastwood, at the helm of his 24th film. In this film, like in just about all his films, he doesn't try anything flashy or groundbreaking at the helm but is sensitive and competent and builds and maintains a good pace and tension. Despite his long career in action based films, Eastwood seems particularly at ease directing (and acting) in films with a strong focus on characters rather than simply action.<br /><br />This is primarily a dialogue driven story, with powerful acting from the three leads, supported ably by some great actors including Laurence Fishburne, Marcia Gay Harden and Laura Linney. Indeed, the performances of Penn and Robbins garnered them the Oscars for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively. This was the first time since Ben-Hur in 1959 in which the two awards have been won in the same film.</p></body></html>

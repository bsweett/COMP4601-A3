Atonement has a wonderful sense of time and place - the peace just prior to the Second World War.  The early scenes set during a hot summer in 1935 seem like a kind of paradise for Cecilia and Briony Tallis, set amid a beautiful house and gardens; but all is not was idyllic as it seems. There is love and jealousy in the air between Cecilia and her younger sister, a budding writer, over Robbie Turner, the son of their longtime groundskeeper for whom the Tallis family has a liking strong enough to erase class barriers and allow the son of a servant to share dinner with them.  Robbie has great expectations in that he has a promise from Cecilia and Briony's father that he can attend medical school.  Love, however, intervenes and everything changes.<br /><br />James McAvoy as Robbie and Kira Knightly as Cecilia are perfectly cast and their performances sweep us up into their romance.  The young Briony (nicely played by Saoirse Ronan) has her own crush on Robbie that is unrequited, and seeing her sister in love with him turns her jealousy into a tool of punishment when she falsely accuses Robbie of raping a cousin.  The relationships between the three main characters are nicely developed; as much as one is disgusted by Briony's actions one understands the impulse.  To ease her guilt she performs an act of atonement by becoming a nurse (Romola Garai playing the 18 year old Briony) in a London hospital, tending the war wounded and dying.<br /><br />The film has the sweep of an epic with the inclusion of the evacuation of Dunkirk. Surveying the vast scene of destruction, the beach littered with broken down vehicles mirrors the terrible twist that Robbie's life took and we, like all of the stranded men, are hoping that Robbie and Cecilia will be reunited.  We don't know until the end of the film where the various threads of the story have taken us.  The story makes use of flashbacks so we are aware sometimes of what is going to happen before the characters do, but when we arrive at the conclusion of the love story of Cecilia and Robbie we know how bitter a single act of jealous can become and how a thoughtless act can have repercussions for life.  This final phase of Briony's life is marvelously conveyed by Vanessa Redgrave, who sums up the story in an interview.<br /><br />Atonement is beautifully filmed, perhaps the best example of cinematography this year.  I was reminded of the beautiful photography that was characteristic of David Lean's films.  Although the love story may not be as compelling as Jack and Rose in Titanic it is just as deeply felt and is beautifully told.</p></body></html>

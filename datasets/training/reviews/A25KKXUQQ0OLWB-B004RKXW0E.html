The kids were really young in that movie theatre but they barely made a movie and were quiet all the way through.  So was I!  Toy Story 3 was far better than most movies in 2010 and I suspect the best one.  Woody, Buzz and the friends are left in a toy chest now and with Andy going to college, mom is all gung ho in cleaning out his room before he goes.  The toys have to be carted up to the attic or thrown out.  That's it.  Andy puts the toys in a garbage bag and leaves it to go up into the attic but mom thinks they are meant for the junkyard and puts them out for the trash!  The toys manage to get themselves to a daycare center but it turns out to be a living hell.  A stuffed bear named Lots-O rules the roost with cruelty and the toys need to get out before they are broken by unruly young children.  Woody has been chosen to go to college with Andy but tries to save his friends.  Adventure ensues.  What is so impressive is how complex the story is and how well developed the movie is made.  Adult movies are usually more childish these days and contain less complex dialog.  Toy Story 3 doesn't insult children or adults and entertains all.  This movie is truly for all ages and meant for enjoyment of all.  Wonderful film.</p></body></html>

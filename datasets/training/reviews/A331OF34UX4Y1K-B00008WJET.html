<meta name="summary" content="MTV CLIP"></head><body><p>THis is nothing more than a overextended MTV clip ( a bad one, by the way). When I heard that it was Drew Barrymore who wanted to make this picture, I knew something would go wrong !!! This movie is so silly and dumb, and even being so it still finds people who love it !!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Captain America The First Avenger"></head><body><p>Although Hollywood has jumped on the superhero bandwagon which has made some flukes Captain America is a Very Good and Patriotic Movie(Minus FDR who was aBiggovtLiberalFascist himself)and Evans(Not another Teen Movie) as Cap,but oh well.<br />The Red Skull is wickedly Cool,the action is good and while the part with Bucky which I should not mention is not true to the Comic it is nonetheless a decent film adaptation with some flaws but worth watching.Besides Cap Fighting Hydra and As in the Comics the Germans it would have been nice in both or perhaps in the next installment(highly doubt it) he would fight RedFascism(Communism/socialism) but being Cap is Apolitical,The Special Features is great with the Creator of Cap(God Rest his Soul) give a interview at 90 years old and some other great features,If your A Fan of Cap you need to see the movie.</p></body></html>

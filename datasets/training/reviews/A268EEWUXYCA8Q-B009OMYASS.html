After seeing Wolf Creek I don't want to go touristing in the outbacks of Australia.  Now I can check off Bratislava as a place to spend time partying in hostels.<br /><br />Before I even saw this movie I was worried.  Not that the movie would terrible.  But that the movie would be almost too successful.  The idea is that, for the last half of this 95 minute movie, you are watching guys getting tortured, maimed and disfigured.  Take away the makeup and the fact that this movie involves actors and you are basically watching a snuff film.<br /><br />Now I have been watching horror films for as long as I can remember and probably before I should have.  But I have a firm grasp on reality and am a (mostly, haha) well-adapted 25 year old without a violent bone in my body.  I understand horror films and their cathartic feeling at the end.  Its all about tension and release, providing thrills and an adrenaline rush in the same way I imagine a person gets driving fast cars, jumping out of airplanes, etc.  The only difference is that in sitting in the movie theatre, I don't have to worry about crashing into anything.<br /><br />What I am getting at is that there is a difference between reality and "reelity."  I could easily sit back and decry this as being pornography of violence or no different than a snuff film (with the exception of the loss of life, granted).  Or I could look at it as the perfect exercise in terror.  For those interested in getting their thrills/adrenaline rush in the relative safety of a movie theatre, this film is the perfect way to do it.<br /><br />It begins, ironically enough, as a buddy movie, back-packing in Europe ala Eurotrip.  There are three guys basically looking for pot and getting laid.  It has been the beginning to many a teen comedy and you can see what Eurotrip would have been had Cooper not gone to Wondersexxx but instead found this.  Ultimately ending up in Bratislava (just like in Eurotrip) at a Hostel, they realize they aren't getting what they expected.  What follows is a grisly tour of nightmarish proportions of torture and human trafficking for money.<br /><br />When Eli Roth debuted with Cabin Fever, I saw a spark that this guy knew what he was doing.  I didn't particularly care for most of Cabin Fever (mostly because it was terribly miss-advertised) but I could tell he had a grasp on this horror thing.  And he had a handle on grim or dark comedy.  Hostel is disgusting, it will get beneath your skin much in the same way certain Asian horror films like Audition will.<br /><br />What helps ground Hostel is the fact that the setup is quite  possible.  I'm never one to fully listen to the "Based on true events" hoopla a lot of horror films have been tossing around recently, but this is one film that you can see happening.  In a world that does have snuff films, hostels and people who have an amazing propensity for evil, things that happen in this film could happen.<br /><br />I was afraid I wouldn't like this film.  I thought that maybe it would go too far past the line.  I won't lie and say its not a gross film because it is.  Its depictions of violence are horrific and there were a couple scenes in which I found myself looking away or cringing.  But Eli Roth does something interesting.  What a good horror film does is show us not only the horror in other people's psyche but also in our own.  Its not the monster under your bed you should be worried about, its some of the people out there.  Hostel shows this but also shows some of that in its protagonists.  There was a scene toward the end that has the whole theatre clapping and cheering.  It was a great scene but also illustrates my point.<br /><br />Without adding to the considerable hype (Quentin Tarantino presenting it?  Check.  Both he and Robert Rodriguez claiming its the "scariest American horror film in a decade?" Check...) it can be considered a masterpiece of terror.  Wolf Creek was brutal but I enjoyed it.  Saw I and II showed more on screen than I thought I would ever see in a theatre, but they were fun.  Hostel?  Hostel was an entirely different, more brutal beast.  I love horror films.  I have never had a nightmare after seeing them.  I'm not sure if this is an endorsement of the film, but, tonight, as silly as it might sound, I'm putting off going to sleep.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Slumming Streets Of Hollywood"></head><body><p>Take Raymond Chandler's noir "slumming streets" of 1940s Los Angeles, a few tough cops who may or may not be "on the take", more "dishy" dames than you can take a stick at all trying to make their way to Hollywood's big time, big screen any way they can. Throw in money, sexual desire, sexual perversion, some stolen scenes from other noir films and you have "Black Dahlia". No, not Chandler's "Blue Dahlia" there is too much visual, up-front violence, too little worthy dialogue, and too little character development for that but all the other elements are there to produce an some what entertaining mystery that will keep you guessing a little, if you can keep your eyes off those "dishy" dames, Hilary Swank and Scarlett Johansson, (or, depending on your preference, those "dishy" guys ). That in the end is probably the reason to see this thing.  It does have that great `40s background music to set the mood, though. You know, if you are a noir fan what I mean.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great adaptation"></head><body><p>Just about every children's book gets turned into movie at least once.  Examples include Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and many Disney tales. Unfortunately, the award-winners do not do so well at either the box office or from the critics.  This list of movie letdowns include The Indian in the Cupboard, The Phantom Tollbooth, Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer, and Watership Down.  Luckily this is an adaptation.  Based on the classic children's book of the same title, the screenplay of this movie was written by the son of the book's author.  The author had written the book based on the experiences of the son after he lost his best friend, a girl, when he was 8 years old.  Now that boy has turned his mother's book into one of the better family movies this year.  The familiar children's themes are all there; longing, family conflict, busy parents, fitting in, school bullies, first loves, and pain-in-the-ass siblings.  Add in a lot of special effects by the WETA group and you have a great movie.</p></body></html>

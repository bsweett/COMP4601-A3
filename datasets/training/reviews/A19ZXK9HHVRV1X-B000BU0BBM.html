Their sleight-of-hand methods, involving ropes and pulleys and a whole host of elaborate disguises and primitive "special effects," eventually count for naught when the boys confront an actual enchanted forest filled with mobile trees, diabolical insects and an evil princess frozen in time waiting for that crucial moment when the usurped lives of twelve young maidens will make her young and beautiful again.<br /><br />Gilliam has always been one of the most reliably imaginative and visually inventive of modern filmmakers, so much so that, even when the films themselves didn't amount to much, we could still find much in them to enjoy and appreciate.  Here, however, our hitherto unwavering faith in Gilliam's talent suffers one of its severest trials yet.  In many ways, Gilliam desires to have it both ways in this film; he wants to be iconoclastic in his approach by showing these beloved writers as being mere mortals with feet of clay, yet he also wants to make clear that he believes in all the fantastical elements of the tales by essentially creating one of his own with the Grimm brothers themselves placed front and center as key players.  That might have worked had Gilliam been able to keep his narrative elements in sharper focus.  Too much of the film feels subdued, rambling and disjointed, and although Matt Damon and a fidgety, hyper kinetic Heath Ledger seem to be having a great deal of fun in their roles, they are never able to break through all the nonsense and connect with the audience as characters about whom we can deeply care.  There's some fun to be had in the conflict that develops between the cynical, pragmatic  Damon, representing our modern times, I suppose, and the more fanciful Ledger, who clearly reflects the more imaginative time in which the story takes place, but that theme basically gets lost amid all the confused silliness and special effects-laden overproduction.<br /><br />Thus, despite all the talent involved, "The Brothers Grimm" turns out to be an empty, joyless, soulless film, a poor tribute both to the fairy tales it endeavors to honor as well as to the men who wrote them.</p></body></html>

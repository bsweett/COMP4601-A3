<meta name="summary" content="Here there be dragons! A beautifully animated and fun coming-of-age among Vikings fantasy"></head><body><p>Hiccup's got a good heart and a bright mind, and likes to try new things.  Unfortunately none of those traits are in demand among the Vikings ... and, as it turns out, he's a young Viking.  They pride themselves on brawn, rather than brain.  They value the ruthless and courageous, the dragon killers, rather than the clever and kind and empathetic.  Of course, since he's the star of the movie, we know he's going to show that what he has is what they need, and that he'll save his village and prove himself to his father along the way.  It's the same tried and true formula that has formed the emotional core of so many animated films, about an out-of-place young person who proves himself to his people and his parent(s) by being completely different from them and doing just what they would never do.  It's what made <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000A345E4">Rudolph's</a> nose bright, what made Remy's nose sensitive (in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VBJEEG">Ratatouille</a>), and what made Flik so clever (in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007LVCM">A Bug's Life</a>).  What keeps folks following the formula is that it works.  We all root for the under-appreciated underdog, because, at bottom, we all think we are one, but what we really want for the outsider is that he or she (and we) be accepted by the insiders.  The formula, though, feels fresh enough here to work quite well.<br /><br />With this film and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ECQ75A">Kung Fu Panda</a>, it seems the Dreamworks folks have finally learned that the the easy laughs that come with the endless pop cultural references (of shows like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006JMLRK">Shark Tale</a>) just make a movie seem stale on a second or third viewing.  While that one was amusing enough the first time in theaters, by the time it came out on dvd it just felt lame.  Kung Fu Panda, though, feels fresh after a few viewings, and I'm certain this one will too.  The range of personalities among the Vikings makes them all consistently interesting, the dragons, especially in flight, are delightfully rendered; there are moments of awe and there are slow moments where you can really connect with the characters.  While I wouldn't consider this a flawless film - the final showdown and the final revelations about the dragons that came with it seemed a bit too easy and contrived - it is nevertheless a beautifully animated and very enjoyable film.  My kids loved it, and I liked it a lot.  Recommended.</p></body></html>

When I saw this movie nearly 30 years ago I was awe struck at the opening. The movie is first rate with first rate performances by Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman, Margot Kidder and of course Christopher Reeve.I enjoyed Superman I and II but didn't really care for the two other Superman movies. Don't get me wrong..Christopher Reeve is a wonderful actor and we miss him but the last two didn't have much of a plot. Superman I was and still is good high flying fun for everyone!!</p></body></html>

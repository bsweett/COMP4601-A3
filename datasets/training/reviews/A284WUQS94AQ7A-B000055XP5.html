<meta name="summary" content="Humans are not the ones mankind should fear..."></head><body><p>This fantastic sci-fi/action film made in 2000 is a good versus evil super hero type.<br /><br />The movie opens with a scene out of World War II that shows people who are born different from the ruling society, being treated cruely.  One of these people turns out to be the villianous character, Magneto (Ian McKellen).  Magneto holds a grudge against mankind and has an accomplice, Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) who can change into many shapes and forms.<br /><br />We are introduced to Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart)who runs a school for mutants that teaches them to harness their powers for the good of mankind.  These mutants possess extraordinary and dangerous powers which are the result of genetic mutations. Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) grows metal weapons from his fists.  Cyclops (James Marsden) unleashes bolts of energy from his eyes. Storm (Halle Berry) can manipulate the weather. Rogue (Annna Paquin) absorbs the life force of anyone she touches. But these mutants must protect those who fear them as Magneto reveals his  plan for the future!<br /><br />I wanted to see all the X Men movies as my friend is currently working on the prequel, "Wolverine" starring Hugh Jackman in Australia and I promised him I would view them all.<br /><br />This film has enough action to keep you on the edge of your seat.  The special effects are amazing! The sound on the DVD is so realistic on a home theater system that it had my heart pounding!  I was thoroughly amazed with this movie.  It is only 104 minutes, but packs so much action you're never bored.  Watch it, you'll be totally amazed!</p></body></html>

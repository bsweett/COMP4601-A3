A PG13 rating precluded the usual gore fest that was associated with the previous Alien & Predator movies, and that will probably be this films biggest asset as a draw at the box office. Brief synopsis - Rich industrialist discovers mystic pyramid 2000 feet below Antarctica, assembles top notch team of experts to help unveil his prize, they all get caught up in a "every 100 year" traditional hunt of Aliens, deliberately cultivated to test visiting Predator warriors. Not much else to say really, if you can't see what's coming next in this movie you're in the wrong movie!. Pretty good performances, one or two scary moments, tastefully edited CGI and a very pleasing fun filled 2 hours of nonsense. Enjoy!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly Bad"></head><body><p>I presume the book was better.  Here we toss some stereotyped characters into an "oooh, bad office" situation and let them do...nothing.  Meryl Streep brought her character to life, as always, and delivered a remarkable quantity of dialogue, but so what?  The movie goes nowhere.  Bumpkin, bad boss, fashion models...  Like those models, it never gets past the surface, and it's a boring surface at that.  No character, no plot, no witty dialogue, no humor, no point.</p></body></html>

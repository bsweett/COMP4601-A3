<meta name="summary" content="A FRENCH RATS TALE"></head><body><p>The animation in this film is incredible, it's so vivid, especially in hi-def.  The film's story is cute and uplifting, without being totally predictable.  Remy is fine protagonist, he is likeable, albeit not exactly cuddly, but you root for him the entire way.  I really didnt like the boy that play's his human friend, if you can call him that.  I was surprised at how much I dislike him and even at the end, I was not pleased to see things had turned out well for him, odd for a movie of this kind.  One odd thing, that really bothered me was how very few of these supposed "French" characters, bothered with actually having French accents.  The hero is a French rat, with a sort of generic American accent, it seemed so bizarre.  Overall, a very good movie with fantastic animation, not as good as the perfect, Incredible's, but close.</p></body></html>

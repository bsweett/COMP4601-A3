<meta name="summary" content="A Stunning Examination"></head><body><p>&quot;JFK&quot; is one of those movies that I love, but somehow it irritates me.  When I say irritate, I mean that it doesn't give me a clear-cut answer to the big question that encompasses this three hour film,&quot;Who killed Kennedy?&quot;.  What you're given are ideas and theories to who did the deed, but never a clear-cut answer.  Even the ending doesn't appear to be that hopeful.  But in the analysis, that's what makes the movie appealing.  It gives you the ideas to work with, then leaves them for you to put together.  Movies like this are generally never taken very well by mainstream audiences, but (as in the case with this film) &quot;JFK&quot; managed to renew interest in the assassination and bring some interesting facts to light.  The commentary by director Oliver Stone on this Special Edition DVD is not just about the film, but about the conspiracy theories, his disgust at current events, and general facts about this period of time that has seem to affect a good deal of his movies.  Also included are some interesting outtakes/deleted scenes and some features on events involving key players and the assassination itself.  The movie itself is full of great performers such as Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Joe Pesci, Gary Oldman, Donald Sutherland, Jack Lemmon, and many others.  It's a film that strikes a nerve and is truly one of the best movies the 1990's has ever produced.  Period.</p></body></html>

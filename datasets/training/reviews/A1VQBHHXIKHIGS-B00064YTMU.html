For the USA Today, MTV, no attention span generation! With exclamation points! However, just to be fair and because I had nothing better to do, I endured 20 minutes. Give me a medal! Tom Cruise looks better with mustache, beard, gray hair. Jamie Foxx's talents are wasted here. It's writing like this that makes us realize that Aaron Spelling was much better than we gave him credit for.</p></body></html>

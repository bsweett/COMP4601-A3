<meta name="summary" content="A Passable Entertainment But Could Be Better If..."></head><body><p>this is one of that passable entertaining movies. it could be better if they had used a more gorgeous guy than THE ROCK! yes, he has a big muscular body but a ridiculous and ugly face! he can never in no way take Arnold Schwarznegger's place! but his beauty is not really matter in this movie, the whole movie, scenario, directing and actings were terrible! BECK (The Rock) maybe a strong big guy but a guy in that size and weight could never be that fast! all of the fight scenes are terrible and clumsy! fastening slow pictured fight moves could be recognized in all of fight scenes. and the story is not something special, two guys are running away trough the jungle and a group of gangs are following them and at the end, they find a treasure, so what? finding a treasure or a valuable artifact sounds good but this is not a Indiana Jones movie! the only person who has given this movie some credit is "Sean Eilliam Scott". I can not tell that watching this movie is an absolutely waste of time but I can never suggest to anyone to even rent it.<br />Although The DVD release is pretty good and it's full of special features but even this could not help it. It's not worth anything!</p></body></html>

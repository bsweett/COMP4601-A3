From Pong to Madden, Pac-Man to Tomb Raider, there is not a single doubt in anyone's mind that though most games have been created for entertainment purposes only, and that the graphics have significantly improved through every generation of gaming.  There are some games that standout from the rest in terms of almost movie quality experience within the game, from intense stories, stunningly realistic graphics, and for the most part solid voice acting, many of today's video game franchises have felt like they are movies that players have full control over.  Such franchises are extremely successful, some examples would be; `Silent Hill 1-4', all of the `Tomb Raider' games, and the controversial `Grand Theft Auto' franchise.  One of the most popular video games with that cinematic quality would have to be the `Resident Evil' series.  With its eerie and creepy storyline and music, dark and dangerous environments that are loaded with evil zombies waiting to kill you, and the great voice-over actors used to bring your favorite characters to life, it is clear why this franchise is one of the strongest franchises to this day, even after having 3 sequels and a prequel game released in the series.  Many of these video game franchises have been so successful that even Hollywood has begun to take notice, recent Hollywood movies based on video game franchises have been pretty much hit-and-miss in terms of loyalty to the source material and interest from the general movie-going public.  The failures would have to be "Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within", "Alone In the Dark", "Mortal Kombat", and "Bloodrayne", the successes have basically been between two franchises the `Tomb Raider' franchise starring Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft in "Tomb Raider" and "Tomb Raider:  The Cradle of Life", and the Milla Jovovich thrillers "Resident Evil" and "Resident Evil:  Apocalypse".  It just so happens that this review is for "Resident Evil", look for future reviews to feature my opinions on both the good and bad adaptations.<br /><br />"Resident Evil" begins with a paramilitary commando team invading a house that appears to be mostly vacant except for a strange woman named Alice (Milla Jovovich).  Upon further searching of the grounds, it appears that all is not as it seems, and that this house is really a cover for a secret underground facility set up by the evil Umbrella Corporation.  Though Alice doesn't recall what has happened in the recent days, except for the bits and pieces she receives via flashbacks, she quickly begins to understand that there is definitely something awry with this facility.  A fact that is proven to be correct by the existence of zombies that have begun hunting the paramilitary team.  As if the zombies weren't enough to contend with, it seems that the facility's defense mechanism has been activated and the facility itself is hunting the commandos.  Now, all are in a race for their lives to escape the facility without letting any of the zombies make it to the surface.<br /><br />Writer/Director Paul W. S. Anderson really had his work cut out for him when releasing this movie.  With previous video game adaptations failing at the box office, many movie-goers and critics were highly skeptical that any video game franchise could translate well onto the big screen.  Understanding that his biggest asset would be to not assume that everyone knows the source material, i.e. the video game, Anderson crafted a story that stays true to the video games, even feels like it could have come from any of the video game installments, yet also stands on it's own as a separate creation.  The actors are all very talented, and all give solid, realistic performances that serve to raise the movie up from being a simple video game adaptation and/or zombie movie into a truly suspenseful thrill-ride that doesn't require any knowledge of the source material so that all movie audiences can walk right into the theater and be on the same page in terms of what's occuring in the movie.  The special effects work for the most part is very well done, a few scenes are a little weak, but I understand that the studio might not want to risk breaking the bank on a video game franchise that isn't a guaranteed success at the box office.<br /><br />Though I enjoyed "Resident Evil", I must admit that upon my first viewing of the movie I wasn't as enthralled by it.  This has mostly to do with the fact that there is a wide open ending to the movie, there is some resolution, but for the most part the story is left open and screaming for a sequel.  Since I saw the movie within a few weeks of its arrival on DVD, there had not been any announcement made regarding a future sequel.  Without a sequel the story is incomplete, and therefore a let down.  However a year later Columbia Pictures announced that they had begun production on "Resident Evil:  Apocalypse" and that the basic story written again by Paul W. S. Anderson, would pick up directly where "Resident Evil" left off.  Needless to say, this made me happy and so when the sequel came out on DVD I rented both movies and watched them back to back.  By doing this I was treated to a complete story that is truly too big to fit into one movie and the need for two movies to tell one story made sense, and I was no longer frustrated with the first film.  With all that being said, if you are wanting to watch "Resident Evil", please keep in mind that you need to rent the sequel at the same time or shortly after viewing the first film so that you will get the complete movie experience as it was intended to be.<br /><br />"Resident Evil" is rated R for violence, language, and nudity/sexuality.</p></body></html>

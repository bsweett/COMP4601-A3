Add two measures star power, stir in one measure conspiracy plot, add a dash of characterization, a soupcon of Hitchcock, garnish with attractive leading lady, and fill to the brim with explosions and shoot `em ups.<br /> "Shooter," directed by Antoine Fuqua, is a nonstop action thriller that despite its predictability -- a pleasant roller-coaster ride in what Hollywood does best:  a star-driven, action-packed tale of good guys and bad guys painted in solid whites and blacks and loads of eye-filling, ear-pounding pyrotechnics.<br /> "Shooter" works primarily because it does what it does well without making excuses or aspiring to great themes.  There's nothing wrong with a good action picture.  Hollywood rose from the lemon groves with silent-screen Westerns, gangster flicks, and historical epics.  Staged fist fights, one-on-one duels, bullet ballets, and full-scale wars have brought buckets of bucks into box office coffers.<br /> "Shooter" introduces us to Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg), who has retired from his job as Marine sniper after his spotter and best friend is killed during a mission gone wrong.  Swagger retreats to a wilderness mountaintop cabin where he's lived with his dog the last three years.<br /> One day, several government agents, headed by Col. Isaac Johnson (Danny Glover), come to Swagger, asking him for help.  They've uncovered a plot to assassinate the President of the United States.  The shot will be taken from a mile away.  They want Swagger to help them figure where and how the fatal shot will be fired.  Reluctantly, Swagger agrees.<br /> But things are not what they seem.  The shot is fired anyway.  Swagger has been set up.  His own murder is thwarted, and a badly wounded Swagger must elude a massive dragnet in an attempt to clear his name.  At this point, the film employs a device Alfred Hitchcock returned to again and again -- the innocent man thrown into a dangerous situation who must extricate himself or face death.<br /> Wahlberg carries the film effectively with a combination of attitude, physical prowess, and acting chops.  Though "Shooter" doesn't offer him the meaty role "The Departed" did, he anchors the action stuff so that we stay involved.<br /> Michael Pena ("World Trade Center") stars as FBI agent Nick Memphis, a man the Bureau is targeting for incompetence in allowing Swagger to escape.  Nick looks at the evidence from the shooting and sees that things do not add up.  Using the Bureau's own resources, he attempts to find out the truth.<br /> Pena is very good as Nick, playing the character with intelligence and humor.  The subplot of Nick doing the legwork -- often dangerous -- necessary to piece together a puzzle whose pieces don't fit, is juxtaposed with the Swagger-on-the-run main story line until the two converge, with Nick showing he's skilled in the field as well as with computers and forensics.<br /> Veterans Glover and Ned Beatty (as a corrupt U.S. Senator) add stature to the film, and Kate Mara is on hand to provide a sort of romantic interest, most improbable given the plot and the fact that Swagger is all over the media as assassin on the lam.<br /> In a scene which goes beyond straining credibility she -- a third grade school teacher -- removes a couple of bullets from Swagger by performing surgery in her bedroom.  It's not possible, you see, for Swagger to mosey into a hospital with every law enforcement department in America on his trail.<br /> But why nit pick?  This is a forgivable sin in a movie whose prime goal is to entertain us with a tale of a good guy taking on powerful forces in a solo, Dirty Harry-style attempt to right the shortcomings of bureaucracy and a molasses judicial system.<br /> "Shooter" is rated R for graphic language and violence.  It's not the best action picture ever made but, with Wahlberg delivering star luster, it is enjoyable divertissement.</p></body></html>

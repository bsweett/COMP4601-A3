<meta name="summary" content="The best I have seen this year"></head><body><p>A very nicely done film about a cigarette lobbyist that deep down hates his job but loves what he does apologizing for the industry and basically making people do a complete 180.  Its basically a collection of short segments of his life with on real overarching storyline.  Unlike most movies of this type that is a good thing.<br /><br />His relationship with his son<br /><br />His relationship with a former spokesmen for the people he works for who has since become a spokesmen for the anti-cigarette people<br /><br />His dealings with a group of militant anti-smoking advocates<br /><br />The most hilarious is his relationship with his only friends the so called merchants of death.<br /><br />With excellent acting from pretty much the entire cast this movie will not disappoint you.</p></body></html>

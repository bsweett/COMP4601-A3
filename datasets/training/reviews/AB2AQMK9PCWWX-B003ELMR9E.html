But, I didn't even try to get the sleep Pacino wanted so dearly and was granted it while viewing this cine. Why? My problem: they should have given the uncredited role thing to Robin, which at least had given the movie more punch when you find out who's the killer. A la Spacey in Se7en. The mystery was supposed to drive the story more. How's the mystery gonna drive the story when you tell everyone who did it from the bat? Granted, the Midnight Sun and lack of sleep angle adds something to the drama, but seeing a sleepy, craggy, crabby Pacino go thru his contorsions made me a bit more drowsy than my fellow reviewers...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="From the Titanic to suburban hell"></head><body><p>Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio costar in "Revolutionary Road" as April and Frank Wheeler, a typical suburban couple living a typical domestic life in 1955 suburbia. To outsiders, it appears that the Wheelers have it all: a lovely house, two beautiful children, a steady income, etc. The truth of the matter is, both April and Frank are absolutely miserable. Frank is stuck in the same stupid job his father had before him, and he doesn't think April appreciates all his hard work, which causes him to seek comfort outside his marriage in the arms of one of his floozy secretaries. Meanwhile, April is bored out of her mind with being a mother and a housewife. Desperate for a change of pace, she proposes to Frank that they pack up their kids and move to Paris in order to turn their boring lives into an adventure. At first Frank is all for the idea, until he's offered a big promotion at work. Unfortunately, the change of plans doesn't sit well with April, and the Wheelers soon find their lives headed on a downward spiral of self-destruction,<br /><br />"Revolutionary Road" is based on the novel by Richard Yates, and it is an extremely good adaptation of the book. Winslet and DiCaprio both deliver the best performances of their careers so far, definitely deserving of Oscar nominations. The film is incredibly depressing but brilliantly well-done. It illustrates the importance of following your dreams before it's too late. (Also, in my opinion, it's a wonderful pro-choice film...you will see why during the last 15 minutes.) This is definitely one of the best films I've seen in a long time, and I highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

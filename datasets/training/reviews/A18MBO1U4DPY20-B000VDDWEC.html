<meta name="summary" content="Whoa!"></head><body><p>28 Days Later is one of the most amazingly directed films I have ever seen. There is great background music in the film and the scene at church had me jumping. This film wasn't your average very scary film. However, it had quite a few good things going for it and I hope I get to see more films like it. I think it makes a whole lot of more sense than the trash that has been released this year like "The Ring 2"<br /><br />Watch this film now or you will regret not doing so. Don't listen to the negative reviews because this film is unbelievable in it's own way. Don't wait for HBO to show it but RENT/BUY/STEAL it today.</p></body></html>

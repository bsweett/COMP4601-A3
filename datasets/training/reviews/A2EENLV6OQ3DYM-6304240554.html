<meta name="summary" content="Horror Classic Hold Up Well"></head><body><p>It was great timing to re-release the original &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; before the &quot;new&quot; version comes out in theaters.  Before purchasing this DVD, I hadn't seen the original in nearly 20 years.  &quot;DOTD&quot; is as disturbing as any horror film ever made.  It mixes black humor in horror in such a way that many other films have attempted to copy with little success.  The acting may be a bit stlited at times, and the storytelling might be a tad rough around the edges, but horror films don't get much more realistic (or brutal) than this.  It also appears (at least from the previews) that the new theatrical version is going to be a far different movie from this one.<p>The DVD, however, is a bit of disappointment in one repsect.  Other than commentary from Director George Romero, there isn't much in the way of special features.</p></body></html>

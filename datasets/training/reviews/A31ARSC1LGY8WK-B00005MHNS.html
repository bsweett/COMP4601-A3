<meta name="summary" content="Kubrick's meditation on the Vietnam War"></head><body><p>"Full Metal Jacket" is Director/Producer/Co-Writer Stanley Kubrick's meditation on the Vietnam War.<br /><br />Typical for Kubrick it has an air of detachment, surrealism, tinged with a nauseous sense of weirdness.<br /><br />In the first half of the film we have basic training at Parris island, which is portrayed in its strip-lit, hospital-like setting as a kind of mental institution where Marine recruits are brutalized. In the second half set in Vietnam, war is literally hell complete with fire and brimstone.<br /><br />The film is stunningly photographed, well-acted, and if not totally successful, is certainly memorable.<br /><br />There are no "extras" on the DVD.</p></body></html>

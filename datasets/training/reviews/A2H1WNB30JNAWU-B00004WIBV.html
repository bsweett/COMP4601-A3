<meta name="summary" content="Very good Tim Burton film"></head><body><p>Sleepy Hollow is a very good Tim Burton film with very powerful preformances from Deep and Ricci.  I gave the movie 4 stars because I enjoy the actual movie but it drags a little bit between the good parts.  But what won it for me was the fact Burton got Chris Walken to do the headless horseman role.  To me he is a very talented actor, I hope Tim Burton and Deep do many more roles together. So if you like some horror mixed with few comedical lines then pick this movie up and see a new version and twist on the legend of Sleepy Hollow.</p></body></html>

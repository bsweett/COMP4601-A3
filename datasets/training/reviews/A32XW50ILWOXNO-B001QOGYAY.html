<meta name="summary" content="Aims for epic, settles for Saoirse"></head><body><p>"The Lovely Bones" is an progressively tedious film somewhat redeemed by the second excellent performance in the short career of Saoirse Ronan. Burdened with the tricky task of livening up the solemn 14-year-old Susie Salmon of Alice Sebold's pretentious source novel, Ronan, presumably on wits and instinct, injects a crucial dose of life into a unpleasant, clunky thriller. Her sky blue eyes and eager grin appear to inhabit one film, while director Peter Jackson and the rest of the cast toil away at another. The movie doesn't do justice to her, the overrated book, Heaven, Earth, or anything else.<br /><br />If you fancied Jackson a top-shelf director, consider "The Lovely Bones" a rebuttal. His impulse to veer away from the territory of Sofia Coppola (the perfect match for the novel) is fine. Turning it into a serial killer showcase - replete with a sweaty, bizarre turns from Oscar-nominated Stanley Tucci - is not.<br /><br />Opening in a Pennsylvania winter, 1973, the movie briefly glimpses the life of Susie (Ronan) a mousy-haired, budding photographer teetering between goofy and artsy, with a crush on an older Indian boy named Ray (Reese Ritchie) on whom she spies at the mall. Her mom Abigail (Rachel Weisz) and dad Jack (Mark Wahlberg) are ex-intellectuals who border on eccentric. Abigail's mom Lynn (Susan Sarandon) is a blowsy booze hound. Susie has a brother and sister, a new stocking cap with a jingle bell in it, and a date with Ray, Saturday, in the mall gazebo.<br /><br />And then she's raped and killed by George Harvey (Tucci), a dollhouse maker who lives down the street. Mr. Harvey - as he's known in the book - builds an underground clubhouse in an empty cornfield, and lures Susie into it. Although Jackson shows little of the violence - for some reason, this irked critics who apparently require, for the sake of fidelity, the disgusting sights and sounds of a girl getting raped - we get the picture well enough when Susie's elbow is recovered by a police dog.<br /><br />Plot? Oh, there's a truckload. "The Lovely Bones" is not a short film. Susie heads to a colorful, yet fearsome "holding pen" between Earth and Heaven. Father Jack searches for the killer with a detective (Michael Imperioli) while Abigail mourns in silence. At some point, Sarandon's character, cigarette and sherry at the ready, moves in. Abigail moves out. Sister Lindsey (Rose McIver) matures into a young woman. Susie spies on her family and, in the briefest of moments, influences them. Meanwhile, Mr. Harvey eludes capture and plots a new murder, while reliving his pleasure in Susie's.<br /><br />Jackson pushes so many emotional and visual buttons - he aims for an epic amidst intense personal drama - that he loses track of the story, and ends up lingering on the faces of his two best performers: Ronan - open, searching, evocative - and Tucci - leering, maniacal and sweaty.<br /><br />Tucci, a superb actor, is given the thankless role of a remarkably obvious weirdo - balding, pudgy, raspy-voiced, slightly effeminate - who appears to possess supernatural abilities to detect movement and remain invisible in plain sight. In other words, he's a bogeyman complete with lurches, grimaces and growls. Jackson likes to position the camera just below Tucci's nostrils, or in super close-up of Tucci's thumb as he caresses the key charm on Susie's bracelet.<br /><br />I understand why he resorts to repetitive stock shots. Sebold's novel is a Literary Work; that is, the kind of book that trots out poet Juan Ramon Jimenez on its first page, and Erica Jong not long after. What's "profound" about the book isn't its commentary on grief - it's the usual anger, confusion, guilt and strife - but its conceit of putting a smart kid in a postmodern heaven with murky rules and "literary" trappings. It's a mildly clever dirge, in other words, with a handful of exceptionally-written passages. So the minute Jackson commanded an army of CGI for Susie's heaven, he was stuck trying to dramatize Earth, too - and those roads lead to Mr. Harvey`s subplot. Sebold's novel is modest and minor. Jackson's bold, broad brush strokes are a bad fit .<br /><br />But that doesn't excuse a chase scene heading for a climax, only to be interrupted, at the very second of the big reveal, by a family reunion. Or jaw-dropping lapses of consistency, as when it takes two men several minutes - in slow motion - to flip a safe, end over end, into a sinkhole, when Mr. Harvey must have carried it from his basement by himself in the previous scene. Or when Mr. Harvey leaves his house for what appears to be a location scouting trip only to return minutes later, without the incriminating items he took with him. There's a good half-hour of this slasher nonsense.<br /><br />"The Lovely Bones," then, reduces best to a series of moments, most of them involving Ronan. Susie's aborted kiss with Ray is just a masterwork of tenderness and timidity, while Susie's eventual entrance into Heaven possesses, surprisingly, the power we hoped it might. The Heaven in Sebold's book belongs to no religion; Jackson's movie makes subtle nods toward Christianity - the tree of life, a little girl's earrings - without underlining in a way that would turn off most agnostic (or just plain childish) reviewers. Wahlberg lacks dramatic heft but you like him anyway, while Weisz's considerable skills go largely unused. (Her effortless beauty doesn't.) Time for Sarandon to retire. Tucci, worthy of pity, earns his Oscar nod in the sense that he commits himself to looking like a nerd, irritates the heck out of the viewer and fully deserves his bloody demise at film's end. You're supposed to hate the guy. And...you do.</p></body></html>

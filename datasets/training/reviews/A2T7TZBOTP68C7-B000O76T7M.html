<meta name="summary" content="AVP Packs Action and Alien-Predator Thrills"></head><body><p>Wow!!!! AVP was way better than I thought it would be.  The creatures are beefed up and more menacing.  Since the Jurassic Park films, these aliens sound and behave a bit like dinosaurs.  The Predators are vicious, with some devastating weapons.<br /><br />The story begins when a group goes on a scientific expedition deep in Antarctica.  Satellite photos have revealed an ancient pyramid deep under the frozen ground.  The photos have also detected a heat source at the pyramid.  Little does this large group of explorers know that they are headed for a conflict between a hunter and his alien prey - a conflict for which the humans are used in horrible ways.<br /><br />The film's sets, effects, and music are amazing.  Can't say the same for the acting.  Fans of the Alien and Predator films will love this movie, as well as Sci-Fi fans in general.  You do not have to be familiar with the two franchises to enjoy AVP.</p></body></html>

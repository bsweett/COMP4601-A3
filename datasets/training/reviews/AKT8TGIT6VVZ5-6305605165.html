<meta name="summary" content="One Of The Greatest American Films Of The 20th Century"></head><body><p>&quot;It's A Wonderful Life&quot; surely must rank as one of the finest American movies ever made. It is one of my favorite holiday movies during the Christmas season, and certainly the one with the best acting. Jimmy Stewart is absolutely incredible as George Bailey, whose unlikely encounter with an angel Clarence (Henry Travers) allows Bailey to see how he's helped so many of his neighbors. Essentially, this film is a warm-hearted version of Dickens' &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, replete with much American optimism. It's also a subtle cinematic ode to friendship, family and faith. Aside from Travers, the supporting cast, including Donna Reed and Lionel Barrymore, is superb. Without a doubt it's a popular film during Christmas that ought to be required viewing throughout the year.</p></body></html>

I thought Batman Begins was a great flick and Spiderman, and especially Spiderman 2, had some great character depth. But it seems like the superhero stories invariably either end up camp and crappy, or they're all about the dark and conflicted side of the hero in question. Fantastic Four had great potential here to fall into the `camp' camp and be truly terrible; not quite as bad as the bad old Batman incarnations, but terminally trivial anyway.<br /><br />In the event it wasn't like that at all. It was light fare, all right, and the conflicts, such as there were, weren't in the same class of `darkness' as those in the other movies mentioned. But somewhere along the line FF accomplished something none of the others did: it was unmitigated fun, without becoming camp. I found myself chuckling and actually genuinely liking it. Something about its unpretentious simplicity was incredibly appealing. The relationships of the characters worked. A lot of it-well, almost all-was utterly predictable, but in this instance that was a nice thing. Maybe that's the word here: `nice'. Of all the comic adaptations this one here's the only one qualifying as `nice'.<br /><br />Does it matter? Maybe not. It did for me. Just sit back and enjoy, and don't ask for anything more than it can give. If you do that, you'll get the best value out of it-and that quite of lot of value in this case.<br /><br />Till Noever, owlglass.com, Author: KEAEN, SELADIENNA, CONTINUITY SLIP.</p></body></html>

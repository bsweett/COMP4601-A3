I worked in an office briefly, and while it wasn't exactly like what was in the movie, I do remember the tedium and boredom, and where I currently work, there's some managers that I just can't respect because of how... stupid they are.<br /><br />Some of the scenes were wonderfully choreographed or written. I loved the printer-smashing scene (which was actually spoofed in 'Family Guy' with Brian and Stewie) and the actors do a great job playing their respective characters, such as Milton Waddams and Michael Bolton. The almost emotionless character of Lumbergh was also rather memorable. I also loved the scene between Jennifer Aniston's character and her manager as they're discussing 'flair'. Overall a great movie.</p></body></html>

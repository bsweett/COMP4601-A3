<meta name="summary" content="A great movie. I'm still excited to see Jason, though."></head><body><p>This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It goes like this: At Camp Crystal Lake, otherwise known as Camp Blood(muhahahaha!)it is said that the camp is cursed. With sadistic, grisly death. Some really stupid people ignore the warning and go anyway. Pretty soon there is a lot of death by means of bladed weapons going on, lots of slicing, dicing, slashing, impaling, anything involving some manner of cutting instrument. When she is the only one left, a very young frightened woman named Alice finds out that the killer is who else but Pamela Voorhees. Seems she blames the camp for letting her 11 year old son Jason drown, and wants them dead. She fights with Alice, and though I won't give away the ending, I most certainly will say that if you like bloody, hideous horror films, this is for you. One can only imagine how much I'll love the sequels when Jason(who by the way is my # 1 favorite boogeyman)takes over the job of destroying Camp Crystal Lake for dear old mom. Happy Halloween, helpless victims. BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA! BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! MUHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! And remember, don't watch these movies-ALONE......!</p></body></html>

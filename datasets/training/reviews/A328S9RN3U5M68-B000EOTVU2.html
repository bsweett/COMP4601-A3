<meta name="summary" content="A Grisly Cinematic Depiction of a Terrifying Tale!"></head><body><p>WOLF CREEK may not be a film for everyone to see, certainly not children, but if you're up for a taste of the macabre then this well made horror movie is certain to please.  The most terrifying aspect of the story is that it is based on true incidents, incidents in Australia that carry the same degree of impact as the Manson murders or the Hillside Strangler.  Murder and Madness are well married.<br /><br />A lively group of young daring travelers decide to take a camping trip to explore some fascinating regions of Australia, such as the crater site that is one of the largest in the world. We get to know lovable Ben (Nathan Phillips) and spunky Liz (Cassandra Magrath) and Kristy (Kestie Morassi) as they set out on the highway for an adventure only to backpack into one of their destinations and return to find their car won't start and their watches have stopped.  A friendly older gent Mick (John Jarret) stops to give them a hand and tows them to his ranch - and the story really begins. In continued scenes of seat-grabbing terror each of the three discover just how evil Mick is, and each is taken captive in different ways, tortured and well, to tell more would be to destroy the plot.<br /><br />Director Greg McLean takes his time in the first portion of the film, leading us to believe that this may be just another outback road trip with love interests, humor, and minor conflicts. But when he introduces Mick he alters the look and the style of the film, opting for some of the most magnificent vistas of Australia as the background for some of the more grisly depictions of horror on film.  The camera work (Will Gibson) is terrific and the musical score by Frank Tetaz adds to the mix of terror and madness. The actors all turn in fine performances: Nathan Phillips is a welcome new persona on the screen and John Jarret becomes one of the most realistic and repulsive of bad guys ever created on film.<br /><br />As long as you know what you're in for, this is a fast moving scary movie that will hold you to your seat and make you check your doors and windows for closure before going to bed!

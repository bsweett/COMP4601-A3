They seemed to depend a lot more on characterization and the human/mutant discriminations.  This one seems to go more for the slam bam action more than story.  The mutant battle at the end of the movie is great.  This movie kills off several major characters, makes some major changes to others, as well as introducing us to new major characters Beast, Angel and Juggernaut.  To quickly sum it up, Jena Grey returns from the dead as Phoenix, a not so nice but very powerful mutant.  Professor X and Magneto are at odds as to what to do with her.  Meanwhile a mutant boy who can take away the mutant ability is used to create a cure for mutants.  Some see this as a savior, others look at it like genocide.  Thats when the real battles start.  Enjoyable action film with great special effects.  Though this wraps up the overall X-Men trilogy nicely, there was a slight tease at the end of more possibilities.</p></body></html>

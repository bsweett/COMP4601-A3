<meta name="summary" content="The Memorable Good & Bad Of 'Ray'"></head><body><p>Jamie Foxx does a fine job of impersonating the famous blues/soul/country singer Ray Charles. To the film's credit, it shows both the good and the bad regarding Charles' character and the choices he made, both personally and professionally.<br /><br />This is a slick-looking film/DVD that provides you with a rich feel of the periods in which the story takes place. Not only does it look good, it sounds good. I only wish there was more music in here. When it's inserted, it's fabulous but there isn't enough of it.<br /><br />The only negative I had with the filmmakers was the overemphasis of Charles' problems being blamed on one early childhood event.  That tragedy was used as cop-out for all Ray's misdoings as an adult.<br /><br />Note: There is an extended version with the DVD but word has it that it is so poorly edited that it's not worth watching, so stick with the "theatrical version."</p></body></html>

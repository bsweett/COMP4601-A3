I was convinced to watch this film after so many people bragged on it in the reviews of "Alien Vs. Predator."  Perhaps it is the fact that I saw both of the "Predator" films before any of the "Alien" franchise, but I don't see where this particular series of films is much better than a lot of other moderately good sci-fi cinema.  Honestly, I would much rather watch the original "Predator" film than either of the "Alien" movies I've watched(I've seen the original and "Resurrection").<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this film is okay, but to declare it one of the greatest, most suspenseful sci-fi flicks of all time seems to be a stretch to me.  First of all, the movie drags on forever.  I have no problem with a film taking a little time setting up the story, but please, speed this puppy up.  Secondly, where is all of the suspense that supposedly had audiences on the edge of their seats?  The only time that was truly suspenseful to me was when one of the characters goes after the ship's cat and has a run in with the Alien.  Other than that, the story was pretty predictable.<br /><br />The film is shot rather dark, but that is expected in a film of this caliber.  Much like other sci-fi and action flicks that have less than stellar special effects, "Alien" uses the darkness and close-ups to cover up its shortcomings.  I understand that this was the late 70's, so exceptional effects were still a few years away, but at least films like "Star Wars" relished in their hokey effects.<br /><br />As far as the acting is concerned, the entire cast does a good job.  Tom Skerritt was my favorite in this flick.  The beloved Ripley character never really grabs at me like she seems to have clutched at others.  Yaphet Kotto's character is fun to watch.<br /><br />The alien creature in itself is a nice work of art.  It has that scary protruding jaw, but that gets run into the ground by excessive close-ups.  The "chestburster" was pretty cool to watch, but nothing too scary to me.  The "facehugger" wasn't anything to call home about either.<br /><br />I know I'll probably get hacked for giving such a poor review of such a beloved film, but I just cannot see what's so brilliant about this flick.  Call me what you want, but at least I'm honest.  Thanks for reading my review, and please be gentle with those helpful/not helpful votes.</p></body></html>

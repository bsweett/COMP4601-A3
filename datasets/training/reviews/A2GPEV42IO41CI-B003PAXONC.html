<meta name="summary" content="I liked Will and the dog"></head><body><p>In 2009, a vaccine for cancer caused a virus that turned nearly all of the people on earth into rabid, blood-thirsty, zombies.  It is now 2012, and as far as Robert Neville (Will Smith) knows, he and his trusty dog are the only uninfected creatures in New York City.  He spends his days watching DVDs, driving the deserted streets hunting for deer, and working in his laboratory, trying to find a cure for this horrible virus.  No matter what, he has to be home by sundown, because that's when the zombies come out.<br /><br />I like Will Smith a lot and here he gives a somber yet powerful performance that tugs at your heartstrings and has you rooting for him.  He and his dog make a very likeable team and they make the movie.  I don't like films that over-do the CGI stuff - I think it makes then too cartoony - and, unfortunately, this movie is loaded with it.  The blown-up  bridges and deserted, weedy streets of New York are too obviously fake, and the zombies, while repulsive and frightening, are poorly done and never looked real.<br /><br />The unoriginal script and suspense factor were worth about three stars, while Smith's performance earned five stars, so I give it four stars; intriguing and sometimes intense, but not really thrilling, due to bad computer images and because the last-man-on-earth plot has been done before (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VAHR1E">The Omega Man</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WC3A0I">The Last Man on Earth</a>).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Matador"></head><body><p>"The Matador" stars Pierce Brosnan ('Die Another Day'), Oscar nominee Greg Kinnear (Best Supporting Actor, 'As Good As It Gets'), and Hope Davis ('The Weather Man') and is exactly what the critics have said about it. Brosnan gives his best performance, the movie is really entertaining, and it's one of the best films of last year. Brosnan plays Julian Noble, a lonely hit man who does what hit men do. They travel wherever they need to go, kill the person they need to kill, and then fornicate with some women. Julian, however, is in a rut over this. Meanwhile, Danny Wright (Kinnear) is a lawyer who is down on his luck. There's a heartwrenching event in his past, he's out of a job, and a tree has just fallen through his house. Danny heads to Mexico in the hopes of getting a job, when he meets Julian in a mexican bar. The two don't immediately click, but the next day Julian apologizes and offers Danny to a bullfight. At the bullfight, the subject of Julian's work comes up...Flash forward 6 months later. Danny's luck is back; He got the job and he's enjoying life with his wife Bean (Davis), that's when Julian shows up and tells Danny that he needs help with a job; Otherwise, he'll be killed. Now, some of this story, has become cliche lately. "The Whole Nine Yards" deal with a sensitive hitman and there's other movies that deal with this subject; But Brosnan so fully immerses himself in the role, it's hard to resist. The way he takes charge of the performance kind of reminds me of Ben Kingsley in "Sexy Beast." Greg Kinnear is perfectly cast as the nervous good guy, who's intrigued enough by Julian to help him out. Also helping the movie along is the score by Rolfe Kent (who scores Alexander Payne's films; About Schmidt, Election, Sideways). The movie's script is witty, the action is exciting. This is just a really good movie, period.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></body></html>

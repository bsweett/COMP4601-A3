There is a definite class division between the orangutans (top) chimpanzees (middle) and gorillas (bottom). The primitive mute humans are just...well, animals.<br /><br /> Charlton Heston and crew crash land on the planet, and are captured by the apes. Heston befriends a pair of chimpanzee scientists who eventually help him escape from captivity.<br /><br /> One detail easily missed is during the trial of the chimpanzees by the orangutans, when the 3 orangutans cover their eyes, ears and mouth in the classic &quot;see no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil&quot; when they are being told things they do not agree with.<br /><br /> Whether you like the movie or not, the ending scene of the movie is one of the best in the history of cinema.<br /><br /> The DVD has numerous extras, but in fact all three commentaries are hugely disappointing as they are quite sparse, and much of it is repeated verbatim in the included and good 2-hr documentary about the movie and all the sequels.<br /><br /> Spectacular scenery, oscar-winning makeup, great score, great story.</p></body></html>

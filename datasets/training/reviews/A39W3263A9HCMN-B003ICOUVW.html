But I wouldn't necessarily call this movie a remake, more of an alternate telling of the classic tale that we all know as The Wolfman.<br /><br />The movie begins as any movie called "The Wolfman" would- guy is making sure nothing oogie happens in the woods at night, he hears a sound, searches for where he heard it, then BAM- he turns around and is scratched by the wolf. So he runs and runs, and before ya know it, he's doomed!<br /><br />Anyways I wouldn't need to recycle the plot for anyone who knows the plot- Lawrence Talbot returns to his home in England after Tragedy strikes with the gory death of his brother. He is reunited with his dad and one night gets scratched by a werewolf. This leaves him with one thing he cannot control: at the full moon at night, he becomes a wolf.<br /><br />This movie is stupid? Yes. It's pointlessly gory? Yes. It hardly has a plot and is just two hours of Benicio Del Toro going around ripping people to shreds? Yes. But THAT'S why the movie is so good! There's nothing that needs to be taken seriously. It's just two hours of werewolf mayhem.<br /><br />The acting is excellent- everyone shines in the roles and it comes off as very stage-like. The special effects are great as always- and in total, the movie is just FUN. It's very fast paced, it thrills you for its duration. There's tonnes of gore too, which adds to the cheesy feel.<br /><br />In total, this movie is cheesy, exaggerated, overblown trash, and yet I loved every single second. The whole movie was thrilling and fun, and in short, if you can turn your brain off for 2 hours, you'll enjoy the pure adrenaline rush that is "The Wolfman". Hell, I own it on Blu-ray- it's a great movie!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Wonderful story, tediously told"></head><body><p>In the years after the terrorist attack on Israeli team members during the 1972 Munich Olympics, Avner (Eric Bana) leads a crew of Mossad agents as they attempt to hunt down and assassinate eleven of the Palestinians allegedly responsible... This should have been wonderful: a great historical story and a master director and his usual crew to tell it. Apart from making achingly obvious points about the pointlessness of tit-for-tat retaliation between Israelis and Palestinians, the screenplay helpfully eschews most of the politics and instead makes this a human story: it's an exploration of the immense personal cost of the politics of revenge for those ordered to exact it. At least, it tries to be that. As the story of a man who comes to question the morality of politically-justified murder, it should have been incredibly moving. As it turns out, it's incredibly dull. It's too long, too sprawling, too unfocused. It felt like a rough cut with 45 minutes still to come out. The all-important interpersonal scenes are badly written, and only one or two of the action sequences are up to Spielberg's standard. Janusz Kaminski's usually wonderful cinematography aims for realism but verges on ugly and banal. John Williams' music is, for the first time ever, utterly forgettable. Also, for once in their collective career, Spielberg and Michael Kahn have made a complete mess of the editing. Lapses in continuity abound. Intercutting the events from Munich with the story-proper probably looked good on paper, but in the viewing it feels discontinuous, pointless and even a little gratuitous - never more so than when the violent climax of the terrorist raid is intercut with a sex scene, presumably as a way of showing the psychological impact of the events on Avner's relationship with his wife. Pity he never witnessed them. The horrific nature of what happened might have been more usefully deployed at the start of the film as a way of encouraging the audience to share the Israelis' outrage. The casting didn't work for me - Geoffrey Rush, especially. What is it with Oscar-winners and bit parts? Does Spielberg really need a marquee name other than his own to open a movie? Is there no Jewish actor who could've more capably played Ephraim? I found Bana quite empathetic but only intermittently convincing. Perhaps it's my inability, as an Australian, finally to divorce Eric Bana the aspiring A-list Hollywood actor from Eric Bana the A-list local stand-up comic. Or perhaps it's just that he was a little better at the latter: as a movie star, he occasionally suffers from the same kind of woodenness that afflicts Spielberg's favourite leading man, Harrison Ford. But I guess there are worse comparisons. I wanted to like this film, but ultimately found it incredibly disappointing. The inner battle between the emotional impulse for violent justice and the rational desire to break the cycle of violence is the crux of the film, but it simply doesn't sustain intellectual interest on that level. The issue is explored in a far too obvious and superficial manner for it ever to really work.</p></body></html>

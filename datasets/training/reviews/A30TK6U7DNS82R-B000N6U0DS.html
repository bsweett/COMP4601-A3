You might pass her on the street without a second glance, which I think freed up something in Newton, allowing her to do some of her very best work here.  Of course she has a thankless part because nobody cares about her anyhow, as everyone has pointed out.  It's sort of like the way Meryl Streep is treated in KRAMER VERSUS KRAMER, except here she doesn't even get to come back at the end, not even a phone call to let her boy know she made it safely to New York.<br /><br />Am I the only one who watched all the extras to this movie and tried in vain to find out what happened to the little boy?  What's the mystery all about.  We find out in every corner of the menu that Chris Gardner became the most successful black enterpreneur of all time.  But what about the son?  Is he even alive?  Hope I'm not putting my foot in my mouth, but I'm curious.<br /><br />When Chris sells his bone scanning machine to the kindly doctor, he cashes his check at Ted's Market, which is on my block South of Market here in San Francisco.  There are big blowup photos all over the deli counter, shots of Will and Chris making nice with the store workers and other neighbors.  It's always fun to see a movie filmed in San Francisco, and I hate those people who quibble about locations, but if you live here you will laugh when you see that every San Francisco park seems to have a BART entrance at the corner, whereas in real life BART is built to service the most builtup sections of the Bay Area, not the country club locations.  I hate people like myself who nitpick about these matters!<br /><br />Finally, I better duck from the rotten tomatoes, but in my opinion little Jaden Christopher Smith is one of the worst child actors I've ever seen, and I give Will the same credit I gave Aaron Spelling for trying to make Tori a star despite unpromising credentials.</p></body></html>

The suspenseful Identity has all the twists and turns of a maze with just as many dead ends. The film starts out like a conventional thriller about a psychotic killer and an attempt to stay his execution. A parallel plot focuses on 10 people who are all trapped at an isolated motel due to a horrible storm. <p>Suddenly, one of them is picking the others off one by one. There's something almost supernatural about the way this version of And Then There None plays. John Cusack plays a former LA cop who is transporting an actress to Los Angeles. He, along with the other 9 individuals, ends up being trapped at this hotel.<p>James Mangold creates considerably suspense with his unorthodox aproach to the material. The screenplay was --surprise--written by the screenwriter for Jack Frost and Jack Frost 2. Actually, I'm not surprised he wrote those absurd slasher flicks. They played with the conventions of the genre albeit less successfully and with a much weaker premise than Identity. <p>The cast all give fine performances particularly the edgy Ray Liotta and John Cusack. Rebecca Morney and Amanda Peet subvert the stereotypical roles their assigned in the movie and also give fine, strong performances. Identity reminds me of Psycho crossed with And Then There Were None. While the mystery at the heart of the film is important, like many amusement rides, it's also about the twists and turns you take on the rollercoaster that are just as important.<p>The DVD features a special extended version as well as the theatrical version. Both are very effective although I found the theatrical version a bit more powerful--the suspense is unrelenting. Identity would be the type of picture that Hitchcock might have done in his prime (if it was possible to do these types of films during his day)or Jonathan Demme when his work was edgier (a la Silence of the Lambs or Some Like It Wild).<p>The picture and sound are outstanding and the interactive menu is quite clever as well. The deleted scenes do add a bit more of character depth but, on the whole, it's clear why they were cut--it hurt the pacing of the picture. Why the film includes both the widescreen and fullscreen versions is beyond me. I realize that some folks prefer fullscreen but that's what the zoom feature on DVDs are for. All of the grit and grime of Mangold's stylized visual compositions are aparent on this terrific transfer. There's also a director commentary but I'd suggest watching the film without it the first time as it might spoil some of the &quot;secrets&quot; of the film.<p>It's a pity this terrific thriller wasn't marketed better or released in a less crowded market; it could easily have been the next Silence of the Lambs or Psycho. In the meantime while you're watching this film stay out of dark motel rooms and avoid looking in the mirror.</p></body></html>

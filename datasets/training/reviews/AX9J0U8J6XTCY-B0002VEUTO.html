<meta name="summary" content="truly exciting, physically astounding sci-fi flick!"></head><body><p>well, i got a copy today because of all of you reviewers here at amazon, and you aroused my curiosity! i had no intention of renting or buying it, but i am sure glad i did! never saw "pitch black" but almost ordered it after watching TCOR! i probably will not order it after all, but TCOR was incredibly entertaining, visually stunning, the sound was crisp, clear, and room shaking at times! in short i had a really good viewing experience this evening, and plan to watch this unrated version again tomorrow! vin is himself, so cool, so tough, dame judy dench adds such a touch of class to the film as does colm feore as lord marshall. thandie newton is as beautiful as she has ever been too. all in all, a great fun ride that gripped me for just over 2 hours.  don't miss it-thanks co reviewers here at amazon. forget you, pro critics who practically hated this film. ps: beloved bill clinton saw it with chelsea and he really enjoyed it alot-bill, if it's good enough for you, it sure was better than good enough for me.</p></body></html>

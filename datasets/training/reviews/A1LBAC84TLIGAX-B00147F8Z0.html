<meta name="summary" content="BOOOO!!  4.5 OUT OF 10"></head><body><p>I liked the first AVP movie, but it was ultimately lackluster. However, AVP: Requiem is bad altogether. There are just some scenes that should never even be included in a film of its nature.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: When a ship belonging to the Predator aliens crashes in Colorado because a legion of aliens kills all the crew members, the aliens get out and start killing people. So a lone Predator comes to Earth to destroy the aliens and prevent them from spreading. The story also revolves around a group of survivors who are determined to escape from the city.<br />MUSIC: This one part of the movie that is good. One of the main highlights in an overall bad experience.<br />STORY: The plot is paper-thin and riddled with holes. You won't even know who most of the characters names. Most of the time you'll be going, "Wait, who the hell are you?," because of how poorly assembled the plot is. I was only able to memorize the name of the waitress who got killed within forty minutes of the movie.<br />ENTERTAINMENT: At first it seems the movie is going to be awesome... until the teen drama steps in and ruins it. When this began to happen I was left going, "Oh God no." Also, the dialogue is bad which makes the story go to waste even more. This is one of those Ha Ha Stupid movies. Also, you may have trouble trying to see this movie because some parts are just too dark to see. I didn't have this problem most of the time, but a lot of people sure did. This movie has some cool action moments, but they all face-plant because of too many poorly implemented character progressions and storyline.<br />GORE: Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad which is disappointing.<br />OVERALL: Bad. This movie wasted nearly all of its potential with bad storytelling, absurd dialogue, and overall stupid characters (Surely bullet-proof vests will save us!).<br />THE GOOD: Some cool action moments, some nasty gore, and plenty of Ha Ha Stupid moments.<br />THE BAD: Too dark to see sometimes, bad storytelling, lame characters, and too many Ha Ha Stupid moments.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I, Liked It"></head><body><p>After reading some of the professional reviews and user reviews here, I am, frankly, shocked. This was a wonderfully entertaining movie that was very well done technically. The Blu-Ray presentation is fantastic. Unlike many others, I wasn't comparing it to what Asimov wrote, mainly because I am unfamiliar with his works. But in any case that's a pointless exercise and I reject movie reviews that are hung up in comparing written works to film.<br /><br />The question here should be strictly this: Did I like this film as a stand-alone work? Yes. Was it well made? Yes. Were the actors good in their roles? Yes. And, yes, I like Will Smith. No, he's not Richard Burton, but who better to cast in a film where robots have been unquestioningly integrated into a futuristic urban society than a hip, throwback, wise-cracking black guy from Philly? I also think Bridget Moynahan did a very nice job.<br /><br />So, the film is technically very good, the plot interesting, and the actors quite competent in their roles. If you want to see something deep and intellectually stimulating, look elsewhere. If you simply want to have fun and be entertained, watch 'I, Robot'.</p></body></html>

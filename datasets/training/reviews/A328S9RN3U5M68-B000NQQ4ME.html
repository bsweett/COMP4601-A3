<meta name="summary" content="National Geographic Visual Splendor without the Historical Depth Needed"></head><body><p>Viewing APOCALYPTO is a visual and visceral experience: some of the most beautiful cinematic depictions of skies, jungles, raging rivers and extraordinary recreations of Mayan temples and peoples fill the screen for a very long two and a half hours.  The images include excessive violence (beheadings, punjee stake traps, genocidal type destruction of a village of people, brutalized slaves, etc) and concentrate more on chases than on drama.  But the effect presented is richly colorful and imaginative.<br /><br />There is little story to tell.  A quiet and fearless tribe spends its time hunting, teasing a fellow tribesman about his infertility and making him the brunt of cruel jokes - just the ordinary camaraderie we are led to believe - until our main character Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) hears a shudder in the jungle that results in his tribe being overtaken by a more aggressive, human sacrificing tribe.  The village is burned, Jaguar Paw manages to hide his pregnant wife and child in a well, and he and the remaining villagers are taken into slavery and marched to the Mayan capital where they are sacrificed by Mayan priests to appease the gods to save their crumbling empire.  A sun eclipse saves Jaguar Paw, he escapes, and after an interminable chase through the jungle reunites with his wife and children just as the Spanish conquistadors sail into harbor.<br /><br />The cast responds well to the direction of Mel Gibson.  Outstanding among them are of course Rudy Youngblood, Dalia Hern&aacute;ndez, Jonathan Brewer, Morris Birdyellowhead, Mar&iacute;a Isabel D&iacute;az, Espiridion Acosta Cache, Raoul Trujillo and Rodolfo Palacias among others. But nearly as much credit goes to the costumer and hairpiece design (Mayes C. Rubeo) and to the set builders (Jay Aroesty) of the Mayan Temples.  Visually the movie is stunning though in a graphically gross sort of way.  The problem lies with the lack of significant information about the fall of the Mayan Empire, one of the more advanced civilizations known: Gibson would have us see only the brutal savagery of a highly sophisticated body of people. A sad depiction of a great nation.  Grady Harp, June 07</p></body></html>

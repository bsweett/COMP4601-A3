<meta name="summary" content="better than the one in 2003"></head><body><p>I was never a fan of Hulk.  The TV series used to scare the daylights outta me as Bruce Banner was morphing into the Hulk.  (And people wonder why I love Wonder Woman.)  Ang Lee's Hulk in 2003 was a huge disappointment!  Those comic book panels didn't sit well with me and the CGI was laughable.<br /><br />I was hesitant as I saw this movie.  Hmmm...not bad.  The storyline continues from 2003.  Banner is in hiding, somewhere in South America, and is working in a factory.  Meanwhile, he has been emailing with someone in search of a treatment for his exposure to gamma radiation.  This contact, we only know him as Mr. Blue.<br /><br />General Ross, with help, discovers Banner's hiding place and sends a team, headed by Emil Blonsky to capture him.  Of course, Banner, as Hulk, is unstoppable and is able to get away.  After this escape, as Banner, he reunites with Betty Ross.<br /><br />Not one to be discouraged, Blonsky continues his search.  However, Ross tells Blonsky about a special serum that could give him super soldier strength.  Blonsky asks for the injection and his next confrontation with the Hulk becomes interesting.<br /><br />In search for answers, Banner and Betty finally meet Mr. Blue, who is really a research professor, Dr. Sam Sterns.  Sterns is able to synthesize an antidote.  However, Banner and Betty disagree with Sterns' mission for the antidote and persuade Stern to destroy the supply.  Unexpectedly, Blonsky arrives and forces Stern to inject him with this antidote.  Of course, things go wrong and Blonsky becomes Abomination, who seems to be much bigger than Hulk.<br /><br />And it's the fight of all fights.<br /><br />The storyplot...ok.  Special effects...ok.  I just get bored with these angry men/creatures fighting like primitives.<br /><br />P.S. - At the end, you'll see Tony Stark (aka Ironman) approaching General Ross about assembling a team.  If you're current with Hollywood gossips and news, The Avengers is next (slated for 2011).  However, not before Ironman 2 and a Wolverine movie.  Apparently, Spider-Man, Ironman, Hulk and Wolverine will be the Avengers.  (I'm already disappointed with the team lineup.  No Thor?  No Spiderwoman?  No Black Widow?  No Hawkeye?  No She-Hulk?  And if you know your comics, Wolverine isn't an Avengers.  He's an X-Man.  Hulk isn't a team player.  And Spider-Man is a soloist.)</p></body></html>

It is bad with a capital B!<br /><br />Ghost Rider completed filming back in 2005, but it was shelved because the studio didn't believe the film was good enough to be released. Apparently a lot of editing was done and a great deal of the film was scuttled, resulting in the disaster that was presented in 2007. Whenever a film sits gathering dust for that long, you can be pretty certain that it is not going to be very good.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage (who looks like he has a 50 year old's head on a 30 year old's body) absolutely chews up the scenery with such a bad acting job, attempting to channel Elvis Presley. In one scene he goes through some sort of Bad Acting 101 display as he dramatically and very slowly (not in slow motion though) raises his arm and points (but doesn't use the single index finger that most of us would use) and then utters the brilliantly scripted: "Yoooooooooooooooooooooou" as he speaks to Peter Fonda who laughably plays the devil.<br /><br />Cage was never secretive about his desire to play this character. Apparently he has been a fan of the comic for a long time. He must have put up some of the money for the film, because that can be the only explanation for the lousy performance. There's no reason for his character to speak like Elvis (and he isn't consistent in delivering it that way either).<br /><br />The special effects are cool in some scenes, but the battle scenes are really a let down. I've seen better in video games. Even the transformation from man to Ghost Rider is not exciting. It looks fake (which, I'll grant you is really misleading since no such creature exists. However, Marvel has done a great job with XMen and the Fantastic Four in creating films that incorporate the real world into their mythos). That said, the transformation should have been more dramatic and less drawn out.<br /><br />Cage's rug is its own character. And that brings to surface something really creepy about this film. Cage playing the title character. Never mind that he's about thirty years older than the character is supposed to be. Never mind that he overacts so badly that you feel compelled to turn away from the screen. It's the fact that he looks so very very old. His face is craggy and his pores look huge. He actually looks like he is ill: his body ripped with sinewy muscle, but his face drawn and sallow.<br /><br />Eva Mendes doesn't so much act as she moves around a bit and smiles and delivers a line.<br /><br />Wes Bentley resurfaces from previously committing career suicide (he insulted Harvey Weinstein of Miramax and threw prima donna tantrums on the set of The Four Feathers, garnering Weinstein's wrath to the point of being exiled from A list films)and plays one of the devil's sons: Blackheart. Bentley once said he would never be caught dead in a special effects film, because he was a "serious actor". Well, he's right about one thing: he is serious....seriously bad. Bentley phones in his performance and seems about as menacing as a Chatty Cathy doll.<br /><br />Maybe there were supposed to be better special effects added that never happened. Maybe there was a better film that ended up on the cutting room floor. Maybe there really is a man in the moon. Who cares? It doesn't matter about the maybes, because the film that we see in this DVD is so bad that it should have remained on the shelf.</p></body></html>

After watching this film at home, I realize how idiotic I was. This film is yet another winner from Pixar. Those guys get better and better at their craft with each new film. The charactors are well-written, the personalities sharply drawn, the dialogue well done. The visuals, as usual for Pixar, are amazing. Perfect animation here, folks. The sound will blow you away, as the oscar for sound editing won will attest. The special features are great, my favorite being the new short feature 'Jack-Jack Attack". This short fills in the gap made by leaving the baby with a sitter while fighting evil. Hilarious! Actually, watch the short first then the movie, you'll crack up! Anyway, this film, while not quite as endearing as others in the Pixar canon, is very touching in a more adult way, and seems more geared for the adult audience. Score another solid success for the folks at Pixar!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Gripping portayal of the last days of Hitler and the Third Reich"></head><body><p>Der Untergang is based on the memoirs of Hitler's secretary, Traudl Junge, Until The Final Hour, and Joachim Fest's Inside The Bunker, and chronicles the last days of Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich, beginning from his 56th birthday to the surrender of Germany to the Russians.  However, there is a brief aside in the beginning, in November 1942, chronicling the scene where young doe-eyed Traudl Humpts is hired as der Fuhrer's secretary.<br /><br />The Third Reich is on the verge of collapse throughout this film.  Certain bigshots are positioning themselves, whether to remain in Berlin, loyal to the end (Goebbels, Martin Bormann) or to flee (Heinrich Himmler).  Hitler himself is told by his architect Albert Speer that he must be on the stage when the curtain falls.  And acts of desperation also take effect on that stage.  Josef Goebbels has recruited defenders of the city, many of them in their early teens, who are impressionable enough to want to become heroes.  Sadly, most of them end up as shell fodder for the Russians.<br /><br />As for the Fuhrer, he is out of touch with reality, the divisions on his map existing only in his imagination.  He still believes that two divisions can regroup and take the Russians from behind, but alas.  And when things don't go his way or he hears reports of lines having fallen, he blames the generals and soldiers, even going out of his way to insult them.  It's ironic how his ideology placed the Germans as the superior race, but when the end is near, he dismisses them of being unworthy of survival and deserving to die.  Quite an about-face there...<br /><br />Traudl aside, there are others of honourable mention.  Professor Dr. Schenke is concerned with the fate of the civilians during this critical time and is one of the more humane characters involved, as he risks going into Russian held territory to get medical supplies for the wounded.  And as for the wounded, the scene of the limbs being dumped into plates, saws used to amputate, and the sight of the injured are pretty grim, but then again, Germany was up the creek without a paddle, so to say.<br /><br />Eva Braun's life of the party personality boosts flagging morale during those last days, in the impromptu parties she stages, leading to dancing and drinking.  She even befriends Traudl, confiding in her at one point how she hated Blondi, Hitler's dog and even kicked it when the dictator wasn't looking.<br /><br />One debit for Nazi history buffs is the where certain major players aren't clearly identified.  Only later in the epilogue, do we realize, "oh, that was supposed to be Goering, Jodl, Martin Bormann etc."<br /><br />I marveled at Bruno Ganz's performance as the angel Damiel in Himmel Uber Berlin, and he outdoes himself as Hitler in this movie, getting the dictator's nervous twitch in his left hand to a tee.  He exhibits bouts of madness, outright callousness, and a man totally out of touch with the reality of the situation.  Yet, he is shown to be gentle and caring to certain individuals, such as his secretary and to Eva Braun.  When one of his trusted henchmen Albert Speer announces his decision to flee, Hitler is saddened, even heartbroken at this desertion.  Ulrich Matthes's portrayal as Josef Goebbels is amazing, as when comparing him to photos of the propaganda minister, there is a striking resemblance.<br /><br />Alexandra Maria Lara (Traudl) is the other great performer that boosts Der Untergang.  Not even a strong National Socialist, she still remains loyal to the Fuhrer, believing in him till it becomes apparent that Germany's defeat is certain.  With the real Traudl Junge bookending the movie in two scenes, I have to say she is hard on herself for not realizing the atrocities that went on during the Reich, even though she wasn't an avid Nazi.<br /><br />But it's Corinna Harfouch as Magda Goebbels, she who believed that there was no future in a world without National Socialism, and coldly poisoned her offspring, making her with someone with more backbone than her husband.  The actual scene when she poisons her children is also quite disturbing.<br /><br />One of the best movies on Hitler, with the best ever portrayal of him in a movie.  To accompany this, I also recommend the documentary Death In The Bunker, whose events parallel that of Fest's book and this movie.</p></body></html>

This film is a real downer, especially if you are a parent, but the story has so many twists and turns that at the beginning you may feel like you have it all figured out only to find out that you were wrong.  Sean Penn looks awesome in this film and his Boston accent is on point.  Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins give excellent performances as does Marcia Gay Harden as the confused Celeste. Be wary when deciding to watch this film, although it's good it might down you out.</p></body></html>

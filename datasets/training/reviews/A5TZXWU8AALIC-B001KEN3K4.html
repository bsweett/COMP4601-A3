<meta name="summary" content="Well Made...But Couldn't Make Up Its Mind"></head><body><p>Steve Carrell was an excellent choice to play Maxwell Smart, the production is first rate, and the rest of the cast is very good...but I kept wanting more spoof and less spying.  There were too many moments when the story played its intrigue story straight at the expense of the comedy (that and Mike Meyers' limited sex and fart jokes killed the Austin Powers films).<br /><br />Still, some good moments, very well made (it looks good enough to actually be a glossy spy film!), I just wish it had more humor in it.  Either way, it's entertaining.</p></body></html>

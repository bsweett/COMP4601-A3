<meta name="summary" content="Disturbing, Yet Sad"></head><body><p>"Monster" is just one of those films where you want to pull for the villain(or perhaps, victim?) but you know that deep inside she is wrong.  "Monster" tells with vivid detail the story of Aileen Wuornos(Theron), a prostitute who has basically been held down her entire life.  Abused sexually, physically and emotionally by her family, Wuornos grows up on the streets as a prostitute.  Eventually she finds true love in the arms of Selby(Ricci), a young outcast who she runs away with.<br /><br />While trying to become honest, Wuornos runs into wall after wall for the simple fact that all she has ever known is prostitution and hate.  She is turned down for jobs due to the lack of experience.  She's even turned away by the unemployment office.  In short, she is kicked hard while she's down.  Returning to hooking, she has a violent experience that ends with the death of a "John."  Perhaps he deserved it, that's what you'll probably think when you see the film, but this is only the beginning of a violent string of murders that Wuornos will commit.  Though she does show mercy to one man in the film, she eventually becomes nothing but another cold-blooded murderer who is tailed by the cops.  She runs again, along with Selby, and the rest is history.<br /><br />This is a very disturbing film.  It is openly honest and, as stated before, you will long to cheer for Wuornos, but in the end, she is ultimately a lost soul with no real light at the end of her tunnel.<br /><br />Theron shines as Wuornos, almost unrecognizable under make-up and her own physical alterations.  Ricci does a good job as well, making me want to hate her for the selfish things she does to Wuornos.  The rest of the cast does well, but the focus here is placed obviously on Theron.<br /><br />Check this one out, it is definitely a must-see.</p></body></html>

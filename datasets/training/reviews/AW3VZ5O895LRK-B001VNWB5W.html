<meta name="summary" content="3.5 Stars-Art & Style Are Terrific-Substance So-So"></head><body><p>-This is more like 3.5 stars but Amazon does not give us that half star to use.  I've read comic books and graphic novels my whole life.  However, I reached the "enough is enough" phase some time ago with turning comic books into mega movie sensations.  I was not expecting to like this one very much but was pleased by its art and style.  Once again though, we have the overly long story of good vs. evil rendered in the usual black and white epic notes.  One vivid difference between WATCHMEN the comic and the movie is that the movie is painted so very much better than the comic was drawn.  The great strength of the comic was Alan Moore's writing.  The art was only so-so.  No one could ever call the art and style of the movie so-so.  It is straight out fabulous. This was a UK work but the action has been transplanted to the USA where Richard Nixon has been in office many terms and is still in office.  It is 1985.<br /><br />The plot is whether the cadre of super heroes known as the Watchmen can save the world from an about to be nuclear war and annihilation. The Watchmen are all retired when this dire event occurs and even worse, someone is out to kill them.  The first killing is of the one known as the Comedian. Rorsach, with the shifting ink blot face, wanders the noir streets to warn all the former Watchmen and to bring them back together as a pack.Their powers are pretty sensational and the movie opens with our seeing the Watchmen in action years ago, including winning the Vietnam War.<br /><br />The first hour of this film was terrific and then with every hour we lost ground.  By the last hour, I was strumming my fingers, fast losing interest.<br /><br />The problem is that every one of these comic book movies is so much alike.  We have a story line that is extreme evil and extreme good  battling some big end, either the end of a planet or at least a country. It is done with great verve and style, looking fabulous throughout. But it is the same story, again and again and again, ad infinitum.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The film's serviceable but maybe not the best"></head><body><p>Comic book movies is another trend in Hollywood that's slowly starting to die out. Like horror movie remakes and ultra-gory new ones to the CGI-animated ones, Hollywood always goes to what's the next big thing. Granted there is the occasional oddball that completely gets a cult following but you mainly see a trend and familiarity. When X-Men became a surprise hit, everything got bought up. Turns out though that Hellboy was actually a pet project for years by Guillermo del Toro, director of films like Blade II and the recent Pan's Labyrinth. Upon watching the film, you get the feeling that it's not outright terrible like Daredevil, it's just you were almost hoping it'd be a tad better.<br /><br />In 1944, Nazis in Germany have been interested in the Occult and they're planning on bring forth a creature from a portal that can turn the Earth into an apocalyptic wasteland. They're stopped in time but something gets through: a small devil-like red creature with horns, a tail and a big right arm. He grows up, named Hellboy, with the help of Dr. Bloom and his friend Abe Sapien, a fish/humanoid-like creature. He harbors a love for his former flame Liz which gets threatened when the FBI sends over an agent named Myers to watch over him. Of course it isn't helped that Rasputin and 2 others want to again bring forth the Apocalypse.<br /><br />It's strange that I actually haven't found an outright terrible comic book movie(oops, almost missed Batman and Robin, sorry) but even lambasted ones like Daredevil, Hulk or Fantastic Four had some likability. For all their faults, whether it's casting the main lead(Daredevil) to unnecessary scenes(Hulk) to just general okayness(Fantastic Four), they were at least films that I didn't felt like I demanded my money back. Hellboy is similar in that it's actually a pretty solid comic book film. It feels like a comic book film and not just a world that so happens to have superheroes. Ultimately the big problem with the film is that it doesn't seem to go beyond its limitations. Sure it's got creatures and such but the film doesn't really reach the heights of the best of previous comic book movies it just sits there.<br /><br />Where the film does excel as well is in its casting in particular Ron Perlman who always tends to play those brash mouthy types. Well it fits with Hellboy. Unlike brooder Batman or squeaky clean Superman, Hellboy smokes cigars and has a very sarcastic attitude. Everyone else is fine but either Selma Blair was the wrong choice for Liz or she just wasn't given enough to do. Points for casting David Hyde Pierce has the voice for nerdy Abe though. The only thing that is slightly disappointing is Rasputin as a villain is just not as threatening as he should be.<br /><br />Unlike some directors who prefer to leave film in that mystery place where making a film shouldn't be explained and dissected but experienced, del Toro loves DVD apparently so the disc is quite packed with no less than 3 commentaries, a documentary longer than the movie as well as branching options and a neat but kind of pointless booklet included. I always find it fascinating to watch how enough special features can change your appreciation of a movie and you get a better understanding of Hellboy when you watch them.<br /><br />I actually blind-bought Hellboy so who knows how you'll react to it but I didn't feel I wasted my money, which is quite the rarity lately. It may not be Superman or X-Men 2 but at least it's an entertaining movie.</p></body></html>

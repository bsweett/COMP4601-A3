<meta name="summary" content="Gibson's Journey Into The Mayan Jungles Makes For An Exciting Action Epic"></head><body><p>Even with all the controversy surrounding Mel Gibson last year (and doesn't it seem as if each new week brings another celebrity meltdown?), I still looked forward to seeing "Apocalypto."  Why?  If for no other reason--the subject matter, subtitles, and lack of star power made it a bold choice for a major studio release.  Films of this nature generally go into limited distribution to develop an audience and critical word of mouth before expanding, if they ever do.  But with Gibson at the helm, "Apocalypto" debuted with much fanfare and backing just in time to be considered for 2006's Academy Awards.  For some reason, though, I still missed "Apocalypto" at the theaters.  I have heard every description imaginable from those that have seen the film--from the "best movie ever" to "excessively violent and disturbing."  And while I wouldn't go to either of those extremes, "Apocalypto" is certainly an accomplished adventure picture.<br /><br />Set in ancient Mayan times, "Apocalypto" is essentially the harrowing journey of one man, a youth named Jaguar Paw (a convincing Rudy Youngblood).  Living a simple and isolated existence, his tribe are very at home within the forest.  One day, the unthinkable happens.  They are attacked by another group with apparent intentions of enslaving whomever they don't kill.  Youngblood's wife and son are stranded in an underground well, many others are murdered, and Youngblood is among a dozen or so who are rounded up and marched out in bondage.  The subsequent journey leads to a fantastical temple sequence, where it becomes clear that the prisoners are not to become slaves--but sacrifices.  The remainder of the film deals with how Youngblood can escape this situation.  The temple scenes feature a cast of thousands, ritualistic and brutal slayings, and a mob mania that is terrifying and believable.  Racing against the clock to save his wife, Youngblood must escape back through the jungle--where all he has to help him are his cunning and an almost spiritual connection to his surroundings.  The action is practically nonstop, it's inventive, and it is beautifully staged.  Much of "Apocalypto," therefore, is absolutely riveting and wildly entertaining.<br /><br />For the purists who will debate the film's historical accuracy, I will neither deny or confirm the legitimacy of the events that transpire within "Apocalypto."  While there do seem to be some liberties taken with the historical timeline (as evidenced by a surprise in the ending--which I enjoyed despite its implausibility), I really don't think that this film aspires to be a "historical document."  Gibson has made an adventure story using a Mayan backdrop.  The feel and look of his picture stay as valid as possible to the timeframe, however, I never interpreted this picture as a "true" story.  Guess what?  Fictional liberties are taken in every motion picture.  Otherwise every motion picture would be a documentary--and even documentaries have an angle or slant which make them less than "true" in many cases.  "Apocalypto," at heart, is an effective action picture that makes interesting use of its Mayan setting.<br /><br />I guess "Apocalypto" is not for the squeamish--however, the violence depicted is by no means unusual by modern film standards.  You can see much worse in today's "torture" cinema, those films that pass for horror with current audiences.  I suppose what makes "Apocalypto" more vivid is that the violence is in a believable context.  There are some beheadings and some hunting scenes, but the brutality is intrinsic to the story "Apocalypto" is telling.  I don't believe serious minded filmgoers will be put off by seeing some savagery depicted in a film about ancient Mayan cultures--it's not as if this is a Merchant/Ivory production with tea parties and witty banter.<br /><br />I do recommend "Apocalypto."  Beautifully filmed, the technical merits of the film are beyond reproach.  The cinematography, score, and editing all enhance this exciting tale.  I imagine these elements really shone bright for those who saw this on the big screen. A great action picture that is for adults--check it out. KGHarris, 03/07.</p></body></html>

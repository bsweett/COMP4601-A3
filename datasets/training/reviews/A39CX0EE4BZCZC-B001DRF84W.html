<meta name="summary" content="Pretty Good, But You Have To Wait On It"></head><body><p>Once the action kicks in, this is entertaining story and the Blu-Ray transfer here is one of the best I've seen: very, very sharp. That alone made me elevate the rating.<br /><br />I mention the above because, boy, this film got panned by a lot of people when it came out. Much of the criticism was probably warranted, but it wasn't all that bad a film.It had its entertaining segments. For instance, the second scene with "The Hulk" fighting three dogs was very intense.<br /><br />One of the problems was that it took 41 minutes for our hero, "The Hulk," to show up! For a "superhero movie," that's too long for the audience to wait. Don't get me wrong: I don't want one of these brainless nonstop action movies, but this was a tad too much in other direction. It needed just a little more spark to keep the audience involved.<br /><br />It was good  to see they gave Lou Ferrigno a guest shot. That was a nice touch. Lou played the "monster" on the successful TV series.</p></body></html>

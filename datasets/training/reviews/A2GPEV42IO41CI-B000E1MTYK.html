<meta name="summary" content="Deatheaters and *gasp* Dates!"></head><body><p>Now in his fourth year at school, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) becomes unwittingly involved in the infamous "Tri-Wizard Tournament," wherein champions from Hogwarts and two visiting wizard schools face frightening challenges in the hope of winning eternal glory.  With help from his buddies Ron and Hermione, Harry battles dragons, survives underwater, and faces a terrifying maze.  Equally scary for him:  He must choose a date for the Yule Ball.  He has his eyes on the lovely Cho Chang but is too shy to ask her.  Lord Voldemort and his Deatheaters play a prominent part in this installment as Harry faces a life and death duel.<br /><br />The movie is very well written and the acting is good, too.  The three kids are now playing 14-year olds and are showing a greater range of emotions.  There is much humor when it comes to dealing with the opposite sex, a talent the usually capable Harry seems to lack.  Watching the three at the Yule Ball is sweet and awful, as these things tend to be at that age.<br /><br />The soundtrack and special effects are wonderful as usual and the suspenseful story is acceptable and enjoyable for children over eight as well as older audiences.  If you're a Potter fan, you're sure to enjoy "Goblet of Fire."  This is the best of the series so far and definitely lives up to all expectations.</p></body></html>

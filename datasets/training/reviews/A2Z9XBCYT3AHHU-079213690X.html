<meta name="summary" content="one of the best ever"></head><body><p>this is a cinematic masterpiece from beginning to end, except for one part...did you guys catch the camera in the background when the sofia marceau's character visits braveheart in the prison? what's up with that? where were the editors in that? <p>the cinematography in this film was excellent though, as was the music, and the acting. the thunderous rush of the horse attack was spectacular, but the man to man combat did seem too much, the short takes on each english soldier getting his head chopped off, or run through with the sword, or bashed with the hammer. that didn't flow to well. but the message of the film is well placed.</p></body></html>

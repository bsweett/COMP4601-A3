<meta name="summary" content="NO FILM FOR THE SQUEEMISH"></head><body><p>In typical Coen Bros. fashion this film is hyper violent, well acted and beautifully filmed.  Bardem won a much deserved Oscar for his role, he get the most out of this psychotic with an odd honor system; every time Bardem was on film, he sent chills up your spine.  The story is one of choices, all the characters have choices and their fate rides on these decisions.  Alot has been made of the ending, and though I agree is sort of abrupt, I really had no real qualm with it.  I did wish however that one character at the end, had been more willing to play the game so to speak, I was saddened most by this persons fate.  Really good movie, worthy of its Oscar haul.</p></body></html>

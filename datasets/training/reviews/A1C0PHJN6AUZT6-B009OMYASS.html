Then I watched Bravo's more scary movie momments, and I thought I would get around to it some day. I wish it had been sooner, cause it's great!! Very intense! Now I have to watch Cabin Fever. I think that the plot's original, acting is great, and there was just enough gore without going overboard.</p></body></html>

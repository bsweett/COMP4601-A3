I am concerned that the ending of No Country seems to have been heavily edited -- in fact it is suspiciously non-violent compared with the rest of the film. I actually missed the demise of a major character and had to re-watch the ending on DVD to fully comprehend it. I suspect that there was more to the film's end and I hope that there is a director's cut sometime in the future. No Country also lacks a musical score -- prepare yourself as the silence is sometimes deafening.<br /><br />Kudos to the actors -- Bardim, Jones and Brolin. They are magnificent. However, the Coen brothers have been more creative in the past -- Fargo and O Brother Where Art Thou come to mind, among others. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009W5CA">Fargo (Special Edition)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXRM">O Brother, Where Art Thou?</a>.<br /><br />As a West Texan, I must compliment the cinematography in No Country. It was stunning. If you are looking for another truly great film set in West Texas I recommend The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada directed by Tommy Lee Jones (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F8O2QU">The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada</a>. That film really captures the soul of this great region and the heart of its people. The Coen brothers were wise to cast Tommy Lee Jones in No Country as he truly belongs to West Texas.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Just Plane Fun"></head><body><p>What would happen if you met a stranger in the airport on the way to catch a plane, then it turned out that the stranger's seat was right next to yours on the flight, then it turned out that it was no coincidence that the stranger's seat was next to yours, but part of a carefully engineered malevolent plan? Well to find out how it all turns out you need only to pick up this fast moving, thoroughly entertaining film.<br /><br />Cillian Murphy was as creepy in this as he was in Batman Begins (Scarecrow)...I'm not dissing him; it's a compliment to his acting and his eerie, piercing, convincing, cold blue eyes. He plays Jackson (Don't call me Jack!) Rippner along side Rachel McAdams (Lisa Reisert), and the both of them, especially their dialogue together, keep this movie moving along at a nice, real time pace.<br /><br />Post 9-11, some of the situations on the plane are (hopefully!) pretty unrealistic. Overall it's an enjoyable rental. Not a blockbuster movie that will land any of the cast or the Nightmare on Elm Street director on the Red Carpet. Only someone fresh off the Red Eye not thinking clearly would purchase instead of renting this.</p></body></html>

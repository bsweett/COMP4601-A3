For those who have not read the book or seen Director Vadim Perelman's excellent adaptation I would refer you to the several excellent plot outlines supplied on the product page for this movie.  Simply put, this is a story at whose core is a house whose ownership triggers reactions from everyone in the tale.  The sensitivity of Dubus' novel and Perelman's adaptation lies in the way the similarities of each of the characters are essentially laid on a flat line of synergy.  A house is bequeathed to girl who has nothing but a lineage claim to the structure which is usurped by the government in a technical error, sold at auction to an Iranian man living with his wife and son in a strange land without any of the amenities of his previous life as a dignitary in Iran.  The middleman in this contested house is a deputy whose longing to leave his own life of complacency for a taste of passion he has never known.  Everybody is basically needy, grasping for some semblance of security, meaning, and ownership.  It all is built on sand and is as elusive as fog.  Each is driven to ends thought inconceivable and yet there is finally a sense of just what it is to be an isolated human on this globe that can be unkind.<p>Ben Kingsley surpasses past achievements as Behrani, a man of such bruised pride and longing for substance that he fosters his own descent into hopelessness.  Jennifer Connelly once again proves that her spectrum of acting is ever-widening as she makes Kathy a credible victim with a crusted heart of forgiveness.  Ron Eldard allows us to see inside his Deputy and feel his longings even though we may not side with his choices.  Iranian actress Shohreh Agdashloo is powerful as the fully realized wife for Behrani and her responses to all of the incidents are heart-wrenchingly beautiful.  Young Jonathan Ahdout is unforgettable as Behrani's son.  Walking out of this film the audience is stunned not only by the ending, but also by the realization of how fragile we all are as global neighbors and how that in the end gestures of kindness will be all that will allow us to survive.  You cannot ask more from a film than this.</p></body></html>

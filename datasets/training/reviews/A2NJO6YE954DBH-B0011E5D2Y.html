<meta name="summary" content="The first rule of being a wedding crasher should be to follow your own rules"></head><body><p>"Wedding Crashers" starts off gathering a lot of momentum.  When we first meet them John Beckwith (Owen Wilson) and Vince Vaughn (Jeremy Grey) are helping the Kroegers (Dwight Yoakum and Rebecca De Mornay) work out the final division of property for their divorce.  The two are snipping at each other until Jeremy begins speaking rapturously about how great weddings are, which serves not only to take the Kroegers down memory lane to a place much happier than getting a divorce but also sets up the coming montage in which we see the "Wedding Crashers" in action.  We understand that the whole point of crashing weddings is for the guys to pick up women, but it is also clear that these two are the life of whatever wedding they show up to, whether the happy couple are Jewish, Chinese, or whatever.  There is, if the truth be told, a lot to be said for faking sincerity.<br /><br />As we are dragged alone through this introduction to the boys, we start to learn about "the Rules" of crashing weddings: (1) Whatever it takes to get in, get in, (2) Never use your real identity, (3) You're always from out of town, (4) Walk in as if you own the joint, (5) Blend in by sticking out, etc.  Actually the rules do not pop up numerically and sometimes it is clear that John and Jeremy are just saying things and tacking on numbers after the fact to make them rules.  But while the whole idea of having a set of sure fire rules for not only successfully crashing a wedding but also picking up girls at the crashed wedding and protecting your fellow wedding crasher, the script by Steve Faber & Bob Fisher decides to take the boys off of the map.  The eldest daughter of William Clearly (Christopher Walken), the U.S. Treasury Secretary, is getting married and since getting in would be pulling off the mother of all wedding crashes, the boys do their homework (not enough as it would seem) and crash the wedding.<br /><br />But at the wedding John finds himself falling for one of the bride's sisters, Claire (Rachel McAdams), while Jeremy finds the third sister, Gloria (Isla Fisher), has become attached to him in more ways than one.  The former becomes the film's serious relationship while the latter becomes the comic one, and while Jeremy has to deal with the complication of Gloria being both a "virgin" and a "stalker," John has to contend with Claire having a long-term boyfriend (Bradley Cooper).  This results in John and Jeremy being invited back to the Clearly compound after the wedding, which is major mistake since this clearly violates several key rules expressly designed to save the wedding crasher from crashing and burning.  John has some initial success in keeping all of his plates in the air spinning, but you can see disaster coming, coming around the bend, especially when the boyfriend gets suspicious about the two unexpected guests.<br /><br />The Clearlys are a strange family.  The father is played by Christopher Walken (enough said), while the mother, played by Jane Seymour, stopped being faithful two years into her marriage and has designs for Jack.  Meanwhile, Jeremy has to worry not only about Gloria, but her brother Todd (Keir O'Donnell), for reasons that become painfully obvious.  Then there is the fact that Clarie's boyfriend plays touch football like it is a grudge match in rugby.  Oh, and did I mention that the nicest thing Grandma Clearly (Ellen Albertini Dow) has to say at the dinner table is that Eleanor Roosevelt looked like a dyke?  This is a strange bunch of people and my basic problem with this film is that Claire does not fit in.  This is a woman who cannot keep a straight face during the wedding because the bride and groom are working in god awful sailing metaphors into their wedding vows, but has been dating her boyfriend for over three years without noticing he is a condescending jerk (when he is at his best).  Forget about falling for a wedding crasher, she needs to ditch this guy regardless of what else is happening in the universe.<br /><br />Fortunately there are enough funny bits in the movie and the decidedly different comic performances by Owen and Vaugh to make it worth watching, although in the end I find myself rounding up not because John learns valuable lessons about love and stuff, but because Jeremy does in a comic twist that actually plays better than the serious relationship the story is trying to spawn between John and Claire.  Unfortunately none of what is going on really sets up the film's final joke, which is too bad because it affirms what I got out of the opening sequences of the film where these guys really like weddings apart from the picking up girls and scoring part.  Most of this two hour movie takes place when there is not a wedding going on, which might be the best indication of where it goes wrong.  "Wedding Crashers" is one of those movies where when it is done I think, good first draft of the script and start coming up with ideas to make it better.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Best Comedy Out in 2003! And I Missed it in Theaters!"></head><body><p>This movie flat out rocks on every level. This is by far Jack Black's finest and funniest on screen performance. He is pitch perfect and contains more than enough facial expressions to make even Jim Carrey happy. All the kids acting abilities are really great as well and would have hurt the film if they weren't in it. I made the mistake of renting this for $4.00 on Tuesday night, loving it so much that I bought it at the store for $16.00 today. So my advice is save the rental cost and put it towards the purchase of the outstanding rock comedy!</p></body></html>

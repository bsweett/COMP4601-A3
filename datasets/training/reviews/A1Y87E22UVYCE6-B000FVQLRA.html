<meta name="summary" content="Entering Into a Deep Dark Nightmare."></head><body><p>As many other people I was avoiding seeing this movie. I thought nothing really new about The Holocaust may be filmed after seeing "Schideler's List" (1993), "Kap&ograve;" (1959) or "La Vita &egrave; Bella" (Life is Beautiful 1997) amongst others. I was mistaken.<br /><br />Roman Polanski has created an emotive and deep film. With poignancy that only a survivor as himself could give.<br /><br />The screenplay is based on the autobiographic book of Wladyslaw Szpilman a well known pianist and Warsaw's Ghetto survivor.<br /><br />Szpilman was an artist dedicated to playing and composing music when war came to disrupt his life and that of millions more people.<br /><br />His burden was double: he was a defeated Pole and Jew.<br /><br />The film shows how step by step a nightmare is constructed around the Jewish Community. First they were limited on what amount of money they were able to keep at home; then they were banned from restaurants; next they were banned from public squares and so on until they are massively relocated into the infamous Ghetto.<br /><br />Vexations increases: starvation, murder, deportation to the camps.<br /><br />All this is shown from the interior of Szpilman's family. How they are affected, how their relationships are stirred. Every scene rings true and touches the raw nerve of the spectator.<br /><br />Adrien Brody fleshes his character with sensibility and accuracy: an outstanding performance.<br /><br />Polanski is at par with his best productions and won 2003 Best Director's Oscar.<br /><br />Even if this is a sad film, I highly recommend it in order to have an inside glance to this terrible historical period.<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></body></html>

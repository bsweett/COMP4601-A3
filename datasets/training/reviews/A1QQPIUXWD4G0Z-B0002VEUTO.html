<meta name="summary" content="A Mediocre Sci-Fi Epic"></head><body><p>Vin Diesel returns as the character Riddick introduced in the earlier sci-fi film "Pitch Black". The film is grand in terms of concept and special effects, but its script and direction is less than stellar.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Riddick's character is one-dimensional: there's no change or revelation in his character which is the basis for solving any sort of mystery or riddle. This is the typical theme structure of an epic narrative/movie. The film's epic status attempts are evident in the plot structure. Our hero is an outcast or in the shadows; people come to him as their last hope to save the world; he has to face an unknown threat alone; he overcomes the threat because of some revelation/transformation and becomes a changed man. The film's plot fails to carry such a theme because Riddick doesn't change as a character and doesn't really seem to be challenged too much. The film actually follows more a comic-book structure where the protagonist is simply an out-of-the-box perfect superhero who goes into a grand finale with an arch-villain and wins.<br /><br />In short, the film has an interesting story line and great special effects but fails to live up to its potential. The plot is weak and supports only an incomplete theme that's based on a one-dimensional character.</p></body></html>

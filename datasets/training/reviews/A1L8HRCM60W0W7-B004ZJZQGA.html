<meta name="summary" content="SNIPPY BLACK COMEDY WITH A GLOWING HEART"></head><body><p>As you start watching this film, hopefully without any prior expectations, you're taken in by the absurd hilarity of two hitmen sent to a sleepy Belgian town and their pathetic attempts at being touristy while waiting for further instructions. The lopey banter between them and among the people they find is fascinating and often laugh-out-loud funny. The character development is deft, twisted.<br /><br />But as the real purpose of their trip becomes clearer, the film  takes a progressively darker turn. By turn ferocious and feeling, it grabs you right up to its soul-stretching finale. Bruges is quite a town, and treated with all the pizazz it richly deserves, but the real juice here is in the spectacular acting. Ferrel is spot-on in the skin of his bumbling criminal feeling remorse, Fiennes a walking dichotomy between mania and scruples, and Gleeson's mellowing middle-aged pro a fine breath of sanity amid insanity.<br /><br />This is McDonagh's first movie after what seems to be a successful run as a playwright. His choice of climax here is not for the faint of heart; he clearly had a ball going plum off his nut. But when you are done, you know you have watched something hypnotic, something rare, something ultimately a provocative rumination over the conflicted humanity of even the most 'evil' among us. McDonagh the new film director has a firm spot on my watch list.<br /><br />This is quite simply among the most eminently ownable DVDs around. Get it pronto, you'll be seeing it more than once.</p></body></html>

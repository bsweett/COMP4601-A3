<meta name="summary" content="I Love You Bruce!!"></head><body><p>I am a HUGE Bruce Willis fan and have been since "Moonlighting" so I have seen all of his movies. (My favorite to this day is Die Hard 2). So of course I loved this movie just for the fact that he was in it. What was it about again? (Just Kidding). It was a really good Fast-paced action-thriller.I LOVED it and feel that it is one of his best movies. FYI: His daughter in the movie is his oldest daughter in real life with Demi (Rumer Willis).</p></body></html>

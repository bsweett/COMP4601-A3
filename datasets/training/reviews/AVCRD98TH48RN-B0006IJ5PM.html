<meta name="summary" content="High School Football, "Hoosiers" style."></head><body><p>The most immediate comparison for this film has to be the sports classic "Hoosiers."  As with that film, "Friday Night Lights" pits the littles guys against the seemingly undefeatable juggernaut.  The players persevere through personal problems, fanatical community pressures, and come together with courage in their collective hearts.  While there are a few predictable moments most of the film somehow remains fresh throughout regardless of the fact that this type of film has all been done before.  By the end of the film I really didn't know if they were going to win the State Championship or not.  The result was up in the air, the suspense and tension in the film at its peak, which made for a much more satisfying experience.  If there is one glaring negative about the film it is all the hand-held cinematography.  I swear I saw the same type of shot about twenty times: a hand-held camera pans side-to-side, catches an image, then rapidly zooms in for a close-up.  It really didn't matter what was in the center of the picture, either.  At one point it is a large bus carrying the student atheletes, another is an exhausted player covered in sweat, etc.  It was done too often to remain kinetic.  I know the director wanted the audience to feel like they were there when it all transpired, but at some point hand-held photography becomes plain annoying.  However, this only takes a little away from the overall effect of this solid, often nostalgic sports film.  I highly recommend this film for anyone who enjoyed playing High School Football.  For the rest of us, it is an otherwise entertaining romp into the world of Texas Football.  I lived in Texas for six years and the fans down there really do love their Football.

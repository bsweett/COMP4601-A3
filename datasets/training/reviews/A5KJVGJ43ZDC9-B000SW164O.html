Everyone who sees this should be hopping up and down in fury like a rabid monkey, pointing at the screen going "Oh my god! That was horrible! I can't believe this!"<br /><br />Here's the bottom line: If it's 'horror', and Robert DeNiro is in it, it's bad. I've been suckered enough by his presence("The Godsend") in a thriller and this is it, I'm done with him in this genre.</p></body></html>

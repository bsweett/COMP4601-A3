<meta name="summary" content="More character development and less magic--still worthwhile"></head><body><p>As Hermione Granger spoke at the end of the Goblet of Fire, things weren't going to be the same at Hogwarts with the reemergence of Voldemort, the Dark Wizard who murdered Harry Potter's parents and was twice defeated (q.v. the first two movies).  Order of the Phoenix confirms Ms. Granger's words.  In it, the wizarding world has been torn apart between those who believe that Voldemort has returned, and the majority under Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge who has gone from being a pleasant but ineffective fuddy-duddy to a paranoid trying to hold onto power, thinking Dumbledore is using Voldemort as an excuse to rallying an army of supporters to overthrow him.<br /><br />Harry finds support in his usual circle of the red-headed Weasleys and Hermione Granger, but he also gains an ally in the loopy Luna Lovegood, a blonde girl who seems to be in her own world, dreamily speaking of charms against nurgles--presumably the wizarding equivalent of gremlins, and who like Harry, can see certain creatures.  She also skips down the corridors like a little girl--quite a character, that one.  But he starts to have a bit of an attitude, extremely trimmed down from the book, where he was very vitriolic at times.  Whether it's being a bit irritated at Ron or speaking out his mind against the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Dolores Umbrage, it's clear he's got the usual teenage issues.<br /><br />It's because of Umbrage, a stooge for the Ministry who doesn't seem too keen on properly educating Hogwarts's students in the Dark Arts, that Ron and Hermione persuade Harry to properly teach those who want to learn dueling and casting defensive spells.  He's qualified after all, given what he's gone through.  It also nets him a brief love interest with Cho Chang, the cute Chinese girl whose boyfriend Cedric was killed at the end of Goblet of Fire.  Umbrage has a typical sickeningly insincere sugary smile and voice, and dressed in pink and with a hat, she seems a demented version of Margaret Thatcher, especially in a form of torture she employs against the students who disobey her.<br /><br />Harry's reunion with his godfather, Sirius Black, provides a welcome relief of sorts, as he is the only kind of real family he has left.  While the two don't have many scenes together, it's clear that despite the limited amount of time the two spent in the third movie, there's a real family connection there.  Black and two ex-professors, sometimes werewolf Remus Lupin and Mad Eye Moody are members of the Order of the Phoenix, a secret countergroup against the reactionaries who don't believe Voldemort's resurrection.<br /><br />But Harry has been having more visions.  In his sleep, he sees Ron's father Arthur being attacked by a snake, which helps the attack from being fatal.  And he keeps seeing Voldemort, pretty menacing with that bald, noseless face of his.<br /><br />Certain interesting portions of the book have been excised, no Quidditch, and we don't see the screaming portrait of Sirius's racist mother, not to mention Harry's Aunt Petunia's knowledge of a few things in the wizard world.<br /><br />The regulars are...well, the regulars as usual.  Of the newcomers, Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood) and Helena Bonham Carter (Bellatrix Lestrange) steal the show from the regulars.  Though only having roughly ten minutes of screentime, Bonham-Carter really makes the long-haired, demented cousin of Sirius Black another memorably villainous creation.<br /><br />David Yates does a credible enough job on the Order of the Phoenix, but with the dark and serious tones of the movie, one might come away thinking the magic has gone in favour of character development, which is well done.  Only the Weasley twins, Fred and George, provide a brief reminder of this, when they mischievously bid farewell to Hogwarts with a superb pyrotechnic display while the students are taking their exams.  And a fiery Dumbledore escape leads a wizard to tell Cornelius Fudge, "Dumbledore sure has style."  I enjoy this installment, though I rate it in between good and great.</p></body></html>

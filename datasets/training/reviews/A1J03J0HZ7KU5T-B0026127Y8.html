<meta name="summary" content="High-Caliber French Thriller"></head><body><p>Fueled by Pierre Morel's vigorous direction, Liam Neeson is the whole show in a preposterously entertaining action-thriller. "Taken" (2008) starts slowly, but once the kidnapped-daughter plot takes over, it's full speed ahead with plenty of gunplay and fisticuffs along the way. Neeson acquits himself impressively as a no-nonsense action hero. The unrated director's cut remains preferable to the studio-imposed PG-13 edit. Produced and co-written by Luc Besson, who will reunite with Neeson for more bone-crunching mayhem.</p></body></html>

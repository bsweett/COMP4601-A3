<meta name="summary" content="Happy Halloween!!!"></head><body><p>I just watched this for the first time tonight with my dad. I've seen clips of it in 'John Carpenter's Halloween' The movie itself was okay. I loved the classic sci-fi look and atmosphere it had. Commander Adams takes his team to Planet Altair. They are to check on Dr. Morbius, who has been there for 20 years. While there, they must battle an invisible beast created by the doctor himself. Robby the Robot is awesome and my favorite character. If you want a classic science fiction flick, you'll enjoy FORBIDDEN PLANET!!!</p></body></html>

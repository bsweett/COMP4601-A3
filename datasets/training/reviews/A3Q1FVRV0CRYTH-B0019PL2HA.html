I personally think he is one of the funniest men in work today, and he never fails to impress me. That said, `Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby' is one of his funniest most entertaining films and is sure to please any fan of Ferrell. As Ricky Bobby, Ferrell plays a man obsessed with going fast. The first few minutes of the film introduce you to his loser father whose only words of advise to his young son are "if your not first, your last" and that's the motto Ricky's lived by his whole life. Twenty-five years later and he is first in every race, his best friend Cal (Reilly who is just as funny as Ferrell) always coming in second place.<br /><br />When Jean Girard (Cohen), a gay French racer, comes to take Bobby's spot at the top things turn ugly, and when a stroke of bad luck hits our hero he's left at the bottom, his `smoking hot wife' Carley (Leslie Bibb) leaving him for Cal and taking his house sending him to live with his mother (Jane Lynch) and his two hellion children Walker (Houston Tumlin) and Texas Ranger (Grayson Russell). With the help of his father Reese (Gary Cole) Ricky is able to regain his passion for the race and regain his place at the top.<br /><br />With non-stop laughs provided by the entire cast, not just the always hilarious Ferrell, but everyone from Reilly to Michael Clarke Duncan and Amy Adams and Molly Shannon (who plays a priceless drunk!), this makes for one brilliant ensemble film With one liners that will live as long as "you my boy Blue" and moments that will go down as the funniest we've seen from this brilliant SNL alumni, Ferrell has cemented himself as one of our most talented comedians, and he can now add writer to his resume, for he shows great chops with this script. I haven't been this entertained in quite a long time. Forget Pirates, this is the summer blockbuster...best I've seen this year!<br /><br />~I wanted to mention on the DVD itself, there are quite a few GREAT extras, like Will's commentary which is hysterical, a gag real which is worth its weight and a bunch of random scenes with random lines that didn't make it into the movie. I purchased the theatrical version since I hear the uncut version is worthless...so for that I can't say, but the DVD I have is priceless!~</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great ghost story"></head><body><p>The Fog has always been misunderstood. Perceived initially as a failure because it didn't deliver the shocks of Halloween and the respectable but far from outstanding box office, The Fog is actually a superior ghost story and attempt by John Carpenter and Debra Hill to try something new. The Fog is an eerie mood piece that has far more going on than meets the eye.<p>On the 100th Anniversary of Antonio Bay the community has elected to hold a celebration and unveil a statue to their forebearers. Unfortunately, there's a curse associated with the community that no one is aware of. 100 years before six founding members of the community caused a clipper ship to crash on the rocks. All the crew and passengers were killed. Why and how it happened is part of the mystery of the story.<p>During the witching hour on the anniversary of the crash, an eerie fog rolls in occupied by the ghosts of that clipper ship. The Fog itself has an uncanny ability to cause electrical appliances to fail, cars to stall and furniture to mysterious move across the room. <p>Clearly Carpenter was attempting to tell a much more complex ghost/revenge story than slasher film Halloween. Although The Fog isn't as accomplished (or confident)as Halloween, the cast and ambitions carry the film. Carpenter's attempt to make The Fog itself a character is very successful. You can see hints of later Carpenter masterpieces such as The Thing in this early effort.<p>The transfer is from a nearly pristine and beautiful print of the film. The extras include the original featurette on the film and a new documentary chronicling the making of the film. Also included are a brief storyboard to film comparison (which, admittedly, could have included a bit more), the trailers, photos and some outtakes.<p>MGM does a terrific job on this DVD, Carrie and The Howling. Clearly they've taken their reissues of MGM and Avco-Embassy productions seriously. I can't imagine Anchor Bay or Criterion doing a better job for a single disc special edtion such as this.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An epic with muscle and heart"></head><body><p>I must admit, I went to see &quot;Troy,&quot; directed by Wolfgang Petersen, with lowered expectations, based on some of the less-than-glowing information that I had gleaned about the movie from the press.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised: I loved the movie!  &quot;Troy,&quot; inspired by the classic Iliad of Homer, tells the story of the ancient war between Greece and Troy.  Crucial to this larger conflict between nations is the personal conflict between the Greek warrior Achilles (Brad Pitt) and the Trojan prince Hector (Eric Bana).<p>It's been too many years since I read the Iliad for me to critique the film based on the source material (I'll leave that task to others).  But as a film on its own, &quot;Troy&quot; works for me.  It's a big, sweeping epic, full of huge battles, exciting one-on-one combat, romance, family drama, political intrigue, and theological debate.<p>There are fine performances all around.  Bana is appealing as Hector, who is both a brave soldier and a devoted family man.  Pitt gives an intriguing spin to Achilles; the character is enigmatic and at times prickly, but ultimately it's a very moving performance.  Rose Byrne instills the Trojan priestess Briseis with a fiery strength.  But if the cast has a secret weapon, it's Peter O'Toole as the Trojan king Priam; the veteran actor brings dignity, majesty, and a down-to-earth humanity to his royal role.<p>&quot;Troy&quot; is gloriously beautiful to look at; virtually every scene is a treat for the eyes.  One interesting aspect of the film is its naturalistic approach to the subject matter.  There are no toga-clad gods or fantastic monsters in the mix here; rather, it's all about the human condition.  Overall director Petersen achieves an effective balance of action, big epic vistas, and intimate personal scenes. Although &quot;Troy&quot; tells an ancient story, the script raises issues that remain relevant today.  The film deals with leadership, loyalty, the role of a soldier in society, and the impact of war on families.  It's a compelling story, well told by a talented cast and crew.</p></body></html>

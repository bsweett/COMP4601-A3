<meta name="summary" content="Marine Life on Display!"></head><body><p>I thought that this was a pretty good movie and that it was a good adaptation of the book and stayed very true to it. This movie exposes that brain washing and homoerotic culture of the American Military. It also shows the truth behind the everyday life of the basic Marine during desert storm. It might not be what you expect in that the action is few and far between. But it also has a ton of the basic war movie stuff that you have seen in every war movie since The Boys from Company C.<br /><br />Still a good movie and worth watching, check it out!</p></body></html>

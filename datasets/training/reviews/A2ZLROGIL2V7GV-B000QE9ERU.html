<meta name="summary" content="&quot;Frank Castle is dead...&quot; (4.5 stars)"></head><body><p>One of my favorite characters in the world of comics (not to mention the world of fiction), is Frank Castle, a.k.a. &quot;The Punisher.&quot; He's a deeply flawed hero fueled with anger and hatred. He's a realistic character that makes you feel for him in other ways that other comic book heroes cannot. Maybe it's because the man is a real man and not somebody with special powers or abilities. He's just a man with a lot of guns and firepower seeking to dish out his own brand of justice. It is a dark and brutal movie with a lot of violence that will turn away some, but for the people who know what Frank Castle is about will appreciate how he is portrayed in this film.<br /><br /> Frank Castle has retired from his rough and dangerous job and now plans to make up for lost time with his family. Only problem is that in his last assignment, the son of a notorious crime lord, Howard Saint, was one of the casualties. Howard orders the death of Castle, and his wife adds, &quot;His whole family.&quot; And that is what happens. Castle's entire family, from his mother and father to his very own son and wife are massacred at what was supposed to be a happy family reunion, but they didn't finish the job as Frank Castle came back alive. Unsatisfied with how the police have been handling the situation, Frank decides it's time for him to take action and dish out justice and punishment his own way. And to start, he decides to take out the people responsible for the deaths of his family.<br /><br /> As I said, &quot;The Punisher&quot; is a brutally dark film that is so unlike any of the other comic book movies. This is because that's what &quot;The Punisher&quot; is; a dark tale about a man who goes around killing (not beating up) the bad guys. There's no way they could make this PG-13. In fact, I would've been disgusted if they had. It would've meant the story would be sacrificed. Let's face it, the &quot;Punisher&quot; comic books are no child's tale. So I was happy that they took it to the limit that they did, while I'm sure there will be people who won't be. The movie is extremely well-acted for a comic book movie. Tom Jane is EXCELLENT as &quot;Punisher&quot;, and I hope that if they do make a sequel that he is in it again. John Travolta is even great in this as the bad guy--but they also do a good job of showing his human side rather than just making him a one-dimensional character. The film looks dark and dreary--as it should be--and the overall product is well executed.<br /><br /> A great thing that stands out in this film is the actual story going on. It's not non-stop action. Does it make the film slow? At times, yes, but it didn't matter to me because I was so fascinated with what was going on with Castle and how he was coping. Although, I think a few more action scenes of him executing a few more bad guys would've done nicely (the movie has one of the coolest finales I have ever seen in an action movie). There's some great character development in this, which was a big problem with the first &quot;Punisher&quot; that came out years ago. Another plus is that it doesn't try to be overly funny. Sure, there are a few jokes in it (to lighten the movie up somewhat), but they don't overdo it. The only real problem I had with it was that I wanted to see more. I didn't want it to end. It made me want to see more of Frank Castle proceeding with his mission to wipe out criminals. I really hope that they make a sequel, and I really hope that they use Tom Jane again.<br /><br /> &quot;The Punisher&quot; succeeds in what it tries to achieve. It's a great and dark story about loss and justice. It's about the mind frame of someone who has lost everything at the hands of a criminal. I must warn you that this is no movie for little kids. The movie is rated R, and it lives up to that very rating. All in all, I was extremely pleased with this movie and I can't wait to own it on DVD. A terrific movie for people who admire dark and flawed heroes who have lost more than they can handle. -Michael Crane</p></body></html>

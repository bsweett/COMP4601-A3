<meta name="summary" content=""Yea I'm Good, Feels Like My Skulls On Fire, But I'm Good" ~ The Forces That Shape Our Lives"></head><body><p>Another legendary figure has leaped out of the pages of Marvel Comics to catapult onto the movie screen. Fire and brimstone are his calling cards and human souls his special concern. Yes you've guessed correctly, it's the Ghost Rider!<br /><br />Nicolas Cage stars in the role of Johnny Blaze who is tricked by Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) into selling his soul to save the life of his Father. Now forced to do the Devil's bidding during the night in the form of a skeletel rider engulfed in flame, the Ghost Rider battles forces opposed to kingdom of the Evil One. However "owning ones' soul is not the same as owning ones' spirit." This Ghost Rider has plans of his own not quite in keeping with his Master's original intent.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage does a fine job adding wit and a touch of comedy to the role, Eva Mendes is alluring as ever, Peter Fonda cuts a fine figure as Mephisopheles and it's always a pleasure to see Sam Elliot in anything.</p></body></html>

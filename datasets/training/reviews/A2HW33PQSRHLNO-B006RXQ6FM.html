<meta name="summary" content="Movie of the year"></head><body><p>The only thing I can with certainty about John Patrick Shanley's "Doubt" is that it makes the grade for the best film of 2008.  Everything else is sort of up in the air, as I'm sure this playwright turned director would have it.<br /><br />Set in a Catholic School in 1964, right around the same time of Vatican II, one could make a good case that despite being set in an atmosphere of faith this is a perfect movie for an agnostic or a lapsed Catholic.  A really anguished agnostic and lapsed Catholic.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffmann plays Father Brendan Flynn in one of the most exquisitely ambiguous performances I have ever seen.  His character is seen, indeed, "through a glass darkly" though despite the ambiguity I don't think any viewer can come away without feeling a little slime rub off.  What is the exact nature of the slime?  Is it shame over a different sexual orientation?  Or is he in fact what the hawk-like, steely Sister Alyosisus suspects him to be: a sexual predator?<br /><br />While Meryl Streep gave a very entertaining performance as the classic Nunzilla, she wasn't really as bad as many viewers of the film hyped her up to be.  I've had more frightening teachers than that in public school.<br />Having attended Catholic school nearly my entire life, I can say that "living in terror of priests and nuns" is, by and large, a myth.  There was some discipline involved, but I don't walk around crying about it decades later.<br /><br />Though she laments the increasing use of ballpoint pens, transistor radios, and progress in general, she obviously has a heart.<br />Always eager to assist Sister Veronica, an aging fellow nun who is slowly blinding,  and patient with the starry eyed Sister James (Amy Adams).  There a few moments of absolute frigidity that occur mostly when her Absolutist nature is disturbed (telling Donald's mother that she will kick the child out if she does up her unfounded allegations against Father Flynn.)  When Father Flynn suggests "secular" songs for the Christmas pageant, she becomes really chilling, insisting that "Frosty The Snowman"  is a disgusting piece of pagan heresy.  Also, Frosty should be known as a heretic and it should be broadcast all over the airwaves during Christmas.<br /><br />There's obviously a lot of resentment on Shanley's part regarding the patriarchal nature of the Church.  When Sister Aloysius and Sister James confront Father Flynn their suspicions about his relationship with the only black student in the school, Donald Miller, he sets the tone very authoritatively by strongly "suggesting" they put sugar in his tea.  His explanation for Donald's absence and the alcohol on his breath is believable.  All too believable.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie in which you have to weigh and balance every word, every nuance, and understand the symbolism if you want to get to the root of it.  Personally, I got the very strong sense that Shanley is playing both sides to evoke a sense of justice: while Father Flynn represents progressivism and Vatican II, he is very probably a child molester.  On the other hand Sister Aloysius represents the desire for female liberation and absolute Conservatism at the same time, which is merely an unresolved complex and not appealing to most viewers at all.  But out of the two of them, she is the righteous one.  This movie has to be seen more than once.  A masterpiece.</p></body></html>

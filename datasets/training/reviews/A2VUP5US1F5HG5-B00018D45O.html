<meta name="summary" content="HACK & SLASH TRASH"></head><body><p>A vanload of 70s teens en route to a rock concert stumble upon a depraved backwoods house haunted by a chainsaw-wielding leper with a bad attitude and all hell breaks loose.  Remake of Tobe Hooper's original cult classic and vastly inferior even to that somewhat dubious underground hit.  The atmosphere is admittedly thick with doom and there are shocks and gore aplenty for those who like such things, but characterization, plot, and logic are all sorely lacking.  Jessica Biel is a standout scream queen and R. Lee Ermey chews the scenery with gusto, but there aren't many other good things to say about this nightmarish movie.  Basically just another teenage splatterfest, if neither the best nor the worst in that overdone genre.  A great example of the barbaric nature which dominates modern horror.  Not recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Trouble in the brig..."></head><body><p>"Aliens", the preceding film in the series, ended with on a high note.  Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) succeeded in dispatching the deadly Queen Alien to the vacuum of space.  And this time she was not the sole survivor.  "Newt" a young girl, and "Corporal Hicks", part of the attack force survived as well.  Ripley, had also salvaged the torn remains of the android "Bishop" (Lance Henriksen).  All resided peacefully in their respective tubes as we faded to the end credits. <p>Alien 3 continues the saga, and quickly sets a somber tone.  An alien "face sitter" is loose on the ship, USS Sulaco.  Acid from the creature leaks out, causing a fire.  The emergency initiates the automatic collection of the sleeping tubes into an escape craft.  Released from the Sulaco, the craft falls into the atmosphere of Fury 161, a planet used as a prison facility, and crashes lands into what is presumably a body of water.  A rescue party reaches the craft, and upon breaking in, finds that only Ripley has survived.  The child Newt, and a bloodied Hicks lie dead in their tubes.<p>Alien 3, doesn't have the suspense of Alien, or the spectacular excitement of Aliens, but it does have a story that doesn't degenerate into pure rubbish.  There's even time enough for love.  Some things do remain constant.  The creature kills, and the Company wants it alive. <p>The maximum-security prison, operates with a minimal staff, with the inmates also running a mining operation.  Ripley's presence, sends shockwaves through the all-male population, and the presence of "lice" (where are they?) leads to the shaving of her head.  Sporting a reddened eye, she is emotionally crushed after learning that her friends are dead.  Medical officer Clemens (Charles Dance) becomes her ally, as she anxiously investigates, searching for evidence of the Alien's presence.  <p>Director David Fincher, keeps things dark and dreary.  Pacing is a bit slow, as Ripley's arrival is an unwelcome break in the peaceful monotony of prison life.  Prison superintendent Andrews (Brian Glover), seeking to maintain the status quo, has no time for Ripley and her "monster" stories.  In the matter of maintaining order, religion and faith, are factors too.  Prisoner Dillion (Charles Dutton) serves as a spiritual leader and enforcer among the men.  These futuristic events have a distinct "British" flavor, as Dance, Glover and many others, speak with accents, and use English slang.  <p>The creature begins its rampage, uniting the survivors in a common goal, as they confront the Alien without any weapons, in a broken down facility.  Ripley has her own more personal problem, discovering the presence of an alien growing in her body.  Computer generated effects are used extensively, resulting a faster moving, and more active Alien.  Led by Dillion and Ripley, the prisoners attempt to trap the creature.  Luring the Alien through tunnel, after tunnel, after tunnel, until it is trapped and killed.  Not very plausible, but still exciting.  The Company, conveniently arrives on the scene, with Bishop II (Lance Henriksen) making one last plea for the life of the alien inside of Ripley.  Ellen Ripley's death, would seem to have brought the series to an end, but then we all know better.<p>Alien 3 is not a great movie, but it is good solid SF that delivers some thrills, and should not be missed.  You see pretty much what you expect, and there are no big surprises, though the CG effects allow a more dynamic presentation of the Alien.  Solid performances by stars Weaver and Dutton, and the supporting cast, headed by Daniel Webb (prisoner Morse) and Ralph Brown (Warder Aaron).  It is a film that stands up to repeated viewings.</p></body></html>

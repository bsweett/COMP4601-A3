<meta name="summary" content="Over-the-top Sci-fi."></head><body><p>This film is a cross between "Blade Runner" and "Flash Gordon."  It has the slick special effects and subtley smart script of the first mixed with the over-the-top look and complete campiness of the second.  But what makes this fun to watch more times are the ridiculous antics of all the characters with their overacting, brilliantly stupid costumes, and really bad haircuts.  Bruce Willis reprises his "Die Hard" role this time in an expensive sci-fi setting and he pulls off the action hero well.  What's great about Bruce Willis is that he is the underrated "every-guy" caught in an amazing situation; and unlike most hero-types who never get hurt during the course of their adventure, Mr. Willis once again takes some bloody shots.  But he emerges smiling in the end, albeit covered with grit, draped in torn clothing stained in his enemy's blood.  This is also a perfect fit for Milla Jovovich.  Unlike the appalling "The Messenger" in which her overacting was so bad as to be laughable, here it melds well with the overall campy feel of the movie.  Gary Oldman is very nearly too much even for this extravaganza, but eventually can be forgiven for trying too hard.  While Chris Tucker steals every scene he is in.  Whether that is a good thing or not depends on the viewer.  The first time I saw this, in the theater, I was rolling my eyes at his painful performance.  But every time since I've laughed at his work here repeatedly.  What was a personally nice surprise here was Ian Holm who plays Priest Cornelius.  It's truly a rare film to find him using his comic talents.  Most times he is playing Shakespearean types or other pompous British characters.  Here, however, he is very funny.  This film cost $60 million to make, and the special effects were worth every penny.  Just remember that this is, in essence, a comical sci-fi adventure story, and really shouldn't be taken seriously.

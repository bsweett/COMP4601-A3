It's almost like false advertisement because the movie wasn't scary at all and it was very boring and way to long. I fell asleep a after the first half hour and when I watched the parts I missed I knew why I went to sleep. It's the slowest movie I've ever seen, you find is some interest in it to see what's up with the dark water but it turns into being a watered down version of The Ring. Everything is obvious from the beginning, you know why the dead child is torturing the apartment building and after that you just watch to see how she died. The only thing making this movie even a little worth watching is the surprising ending. It's better to see the original Japanese version anyway.</p></body></html>

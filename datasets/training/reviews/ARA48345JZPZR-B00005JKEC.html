<meta name="summary" content="Denzel is Dynamite!"></head><body><p>Well, Denzel's Oscar was no Hollywood "gimme", he earned it all the way with a powerful and disturbing portrayal.  Beside being a consistently terrific actor, Denzel Washington is a true Movie Star.  He commands the screen the way the young Brando or Newman did, with complete authority.  And he was really on his game here.  The 5 stars are for his performance!<p>I have not been a fan of Ethan Hawke in some of his earlier, arsty-fartsy Mr. Sensitivo roles.  So I was surprised at how well he held his own opposite the power of Washington in this film.  Will reserve judgement on Mr. Hawke for the future.<p>So, these two fine nominated & deserving performances are worth the trip alone.  The film's main problem is it becomes a bit excessive & melodramatic toward the end.  Will put some off, but by then, I was hooked into the flick and was willing to go wherever it went.  <p>Not just about a twisted cop who has completely lost his moral compass and bearings and has become the thing he started out to destroy, the Hawke character gets in deep because of his own ambition, the same type of desire for power that must have fed Washington's young Alonzo, before his complete corruption.<p>So we have a two character waltz, of the seducer (the Devil assumes a pleasing shape) and the honest, naive, but flawed  seducee.  We watch Alonzo tempt and belittle and flatter his young protege, bending him to his will.  We watch Jake be shocked, resist and argue but give in to his own ambition.  And there are surprises to come.<p>The movie is tough & brutal, the dialogue fast & gritty,  the direction fluid and restless, all pulsing to the beat of these hot LA streets.  Not a perfect flick, but a riveting one. 4-1/2 stars.</p></body></html>

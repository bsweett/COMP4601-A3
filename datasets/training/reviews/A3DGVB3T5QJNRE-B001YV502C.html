<meta name="summary" content="Nothing But Glorified War-Porn! Can I Have A Refund, Please!"></head><body><p>This movie is a Saving Private Ryan rip-off.  It's one man's quest to save another person, from what, we are never told - but why bother with details? The violence is so graphic, and frequent, it must consume half the movie! To be perfectly honest I left the theater feeling bored and empty! I was also incredulous: Where's the story? At least Saving Private Ryan had a beginning, middle and end.  This mockery of a sci-fi film had virtually no beginning or end - it felt like one overly long chapter of a book taken out of context.  Not my idea of good story telling!<br /><br /> I can only speculate this film is doing so well in the United States because a large segment of the American public enjoys watching scenes of incredible violence and destruction. I'm tired of it! It's dreary, monotonous, and annoying! We have enough butchering going on in the real world that I don't need to pay to watch it, too!<br /><br />What makes this movie so incredibly sad is the waste of such outstanding acting talent! Don't actors, and their agents, bother to read the scripts before they sign on? If top acting talent started saying no to junk, then junk would be harder to sell to the moviegoing public!<br /><br />What messages is the viewer left with while watching this godforsaken movie? The human race will go barren for no apparent reason. The world, except Great Britian, (for some strange reason), will be reduced to savagery. The British government that does survives will, of course,  be fascist. Those who oppose the government will have to be terrorists. The good guys are so few, there's only a handful of people willing to save the last child on earth. People become terrorists because, "they just want respect!" (How touching, I never knew terrorists had such sensitive feelings!) The good guys come out of the blue, and you will know absolutely nothing about them, except they know how to pilot a large boat. People die constantly from stray bullets. (Then don't stand-up while the shooting is going on silly!) So many people die in this film, it becomes an artform: How many different ways can people possibly fall down in the same movie? It must set some sort of record!<br /><br />I repeat! This is not sci-fi! This is a war film, geared to teenage boys and young men. If you want to see really powerful & intelligent sci-fi then let your fingers do the walking over the Internet and purchase: 1. Zardoz, 2. Soylent Green, 3. Beneath the Planet of the Apes, 4. Silent Running, 5. Enemy Mine, 6. Light Years (By Rene Laloux), 7. Fantastic Planet, 8. Final Fantasy - The Spirit Within, 9. Artificial Intelligence (A.I.),  10. Bicentennial Man, 11.  GalaxyQuest (for comic relief!). While taste in film is personal, like any art, these eleven films, seen together, could change a person's life!</p></body></html>

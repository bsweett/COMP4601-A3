<meta name="summary" content="Pixar gets it right"></head><body><p>If "Toy Story 3" does not have as much free-wheeling humor as the first two films, it more than makes up for it in the overall /darkness/ of the story. This is a tale of having to let go of something you dearly love, and Pixar pulls out all the emotional stops, without getting the least bit syrupy or sappy. Kids /will/ enjoy the film, but many adults will find themselves crying. This isn't to say there's no humor (Buzz's switch to Spanish-language mode is particularly amusing, and Ken takes a lot of poking), but "Toy Story 3" is fundamentally serious. I was worried that it would be a mediocre "tie up the franchise with a third film simply to make a buck", but it is a solid, involving, /genuinely moving/ film.<br /><br />I saw the 3D version, and the thrilling opening sequence shows just how effective 3D can be when properly used.<br /><br />Though a bit disappointing (the overall plot is too much like #2), it is a worthy conclusion to the trilogy.</p></body></html>

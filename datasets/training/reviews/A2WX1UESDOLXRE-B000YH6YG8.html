<meta name="summary" content="Disturbing, but Important"></head><body><p>I saw this movie, and well, it disturbed me. Some scenes were incredibly graphic. I wanted to shield my eyes like a five year old watching a kissing scene in a movie. However, this movie is wonderful in many other ways. It has the whole This Is What Racism Is And It's Bad theme, Edward Norton does a wonderful job portraying a man who has killed because he was a racist and then fighting with the demons of the killing, and the filming technique is brilliant. I can't explain it all, so I will leave you to see this movie on your own. This is one of those movies that everyone should see, but not one that everyone will like. It's more of a movie to be respected.</p></body></html>

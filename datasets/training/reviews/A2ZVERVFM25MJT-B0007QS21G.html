<meta name="summary" content="Great popcorn"></head><body><p>With a fair few summer blockbusters stencilled in this season, including Spiderman 2, the third Harry Potter movie, both of which are bound to do well, The Day After Tomorrow gets in early.  Not only is it timed well in this respect but its themes of global warming reaching catastrophic circumstances are surely the most apt thing to create worry lines across most people's foreheads.  And so we have, in effect, Roland Emmerich's follow-up to his enormously successful Independence Day.  Only this time it's Mother Nature trying to wipe us out rather than a planet of pesky aliens.<p>The reliable if slightly dull Dennis Quaid leads the cast as a scientist who predicts that global warming will speed up the effects of a new ice age which will occur amid floods, typhoons, hurricanes, blizzards and hurricanes.  This will all take place in about a week.  All more's the pity, because Quaid's son (played by rising star Jake Gyllenhaal) is stranded in New York with his best friend a girl he's secretly in love with.  Stop me if you've heard this...Okay, so the plot's pretty much a given from the start, with expendable characters clearly labelled early on.  But Emmerich sure does know how to pull out all the punches as far as special effects are concerned, and the flooding of New York is spectacular stuff, just perfect for summer  edge-of-your-seat excitement.  All in all it reeks of a man who knows how to make pretty rubbish popcorn movies very well.  And that's what this is - something you know isn't anything special whilst you're watching it, but still manages to drag you in.  The acting is all good, and with any luck this will raise the highly talented Gyllenhaal to a new audience after his astute performances in Donnie Darko and The Good Girl.  And did I mention that the special effects are superb?!<p>Of course, for the man who's done it all before with Independence Day this is old hat, and Emmerich seems to have caught onto the fact that Godzilla wasn't successful because it didn't really tap into anything around at the time.  Just as Independence Day rode on the success of X-Files and Men In Black, so The Day After Tomorrow allows a certain pseudo-science eco-warning that can create a spectacle interesting enough to hold its audience for an hour and a half.  Unfortunately, it doesn't quite stand up against Independence Day though, partly because CGI has become somewhat old hat now, and there's no enduring image like the destruction of the White House in the former.  However, it's not without its trite charm, and it's safe to say that if you've enjoyed Emmerich's previous movies then you'll definitely enjoy this because, for what it is, this is very very good.<p>Still, the complaints that no audience is yet quite willing to watch the destruction of New York just yet, have surfaced not unjustifiably, and this iminges on what enjoyment you might receive from watching things being rapidly obliterated before your very eyes.  Worse still, there are some cringe-worthy subplots that seem wholly unnecessary, in particular a child with cancer unable to leave the hospital he's being taken care in, and an appallingly set-up chase scene involving wolves that escaped from a local zoo.  All this and there's some terrible stereotyping of the British, where the whole of Europe can be wiped off the map and nobody really cares because America's okay.  Yet even the usual heavy dose of patriotism seems tempered by Emmerich laying all the blame for the disaster on America's shoulders, having them begging to reside in third-world countries.  These heavy-handed and seemingly contradicting politics might confuse you, but they don't take away from the enjoyment of the film.  Though it probably won't be the best film you'll see this summer by a long way, the time you're watching it on the big screen will feel thoroughly worth your time right up until the credits roll.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Brothers" In Arms"></head><body><p>John Singleton's latest is a decent enough time passer & a remake to the John Wayne film, "The Sons Of Katie Elder".<br /><br />The Mercer boys, four adopted brothers return home to pay their respects after their mother has been gunned down in a grocery holdup gone bad. The oldest Mercer wants to know what happened at the crime scene & upon looking at some of the evidence, he quickly comes to the conclusion that his mother's death was no accident. The four boys band together to find who, how, & why their mother was senselessly murdered.<br /><br />"Four Brothers" has a decent premise, but, I didn't find the characters very likable. The four boys are pretty obnoxious, & seem like royal pains in the as*es, throwing smack at the local detectives, barging into places looking for clues or questioning possible suspects.<br /><br />There are also quite a few loopholes in the film. From looking at the store security tape, to shooting a possible suspect, to the final fight at the end, these brothers would have been doing some long hard jail time if this was reality.<br /><br />The premise of the film is what kept me watching "Four Brothers". I was guessing as to why the mother was killed & how the movie was going to turn out at the end.<br /><br />"Four Brothers" is definitley rental material or catch it when it comes to "Starz".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="FLAWED SCIENCE AND A FLAWED MOVIE"></head><body><p>Disaster films have always been popular movie fare and the Day After tomorrow" really shows off the ultimate in disaters...total global climate change.<br /><br />Dennis Quaid plays Jack Hall a climatologist who predicts the devastating effects of global warming which he thinks ist still hundreds of years away.  Nope...try days.  The Atlantic tides have a drastic increase in temperature with immediately start causing catastrophic weather around the world including baseball sized hail in Japan and tornados in LA, and New York hit first with torrential rains and then a huge tidal wave which floods the city so much that freighters go floating down the street....yeah right.<br /><br />Any way, Hall's son Sam just happens to be in NY for an academic competition and he along with several friends takes refuge from the storm in the NYC public Library.  Why the Library is picked over much taller buildings is anyone's guess but of course with all the books, it makes great fuel for the fireplace as the sole means of warmth.<br /><br />The eye of the storm causes the temperature to drop to -150 degrees...freezing people where they stand.  Jack decides to set out from Washington DC to rescue his son and two collegues join him.  Their van crashes outside of Philadelphia...so they decide to walk...to NY....from Philadelphia...in sub-zero temps...and sleep at night in a tent...OK....<br /><br />Director Roland Emmerich is the same guy who brought us Independence Day a few years back.  Another spectacular looking but ridiculous film.  Emmerich sure does love destroying LA though.<br /><br />The effects are pretty cool to see, but there's nothing we haven't seen before in movies like Twister, or Deep Impact.  The plot is just so inconceivalbe that I just rolled my eyes through most of the non-sense.<br /><br />Fun popcorn movie, but short on plot, logic, and intelligence.</p></body></html>

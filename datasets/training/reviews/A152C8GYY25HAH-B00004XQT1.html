<meta name="summary" content="Interesting adaptation puts satire ahead of violence"></head><body><p>American Psycho is the long delayed film version of the novel by Bret Easton Ellis. When it was published nearly ten years ago, it was met with a storm of controversy. Its quite graphic violence caused critics to overlook the book's central theme, which is that a society awash in materialism will lose its collective soul. As the main character puts it, "The only true emotions I feel are disgust and greed." Originally, Oliver Stone wanted to film it using Leonardo DiCaprio as the protagonist, Patrick Bateman. I can see Leo D. in the part, but I imagine Stone would have made a very violent and very loud mess of it. Finally, the project was placed in the hands of director Mary Harron, and she wisely chose to emphasis the book's satirical and comedic elements over its violence. The result is a movie that is about as good a filming of the novel as one could hope for. Whether or not it is also entertainment depends on each viewer's tastes. <p>Christian Bale gives the performance of his life as Patrick Bateman. Patrick is a young man who is the epitome of a soulless success. Wickedly bright and utterly ruthless, he makes big bucks working at a high powered finanical concern in New York. He works out religiously. He is fanatical about his appearance, and his morning routine of getting himself cleaned up, made up and dressed for work would put any movie star to shame. His wardrobe is impeccable. His haircut is perfect. Even his business cards are designed to be the best. Any coworker who dresses better or looks better than Patrick is considered to be competition and, thus, one of the enemy. His carefully contrived personal appearance goes far beyond the masks we knew in the past. It is more of a tool than his words or his actions. It is also a trap and a weapon. Yet most of the people Patrick knows seem to be using the same weapon, while Patrick is the only one who knows that behind the facade there is usually only emptiness. In this pursuit of meaningless physical and material perfection, he has also gone stark raving mad. He finally snaps. One evening he takes Paul Allen [Jared Leto], his fiercest competitor, out to dinner and then to his apartment, where he coldly and calculatedly kills him with an ax. When the police question him about the missing Allen, he coolly throws them off the track. At the same time, as his madness takes complete control, he goes on a murderous rampage. <p>American Psycho is not a slasher flick nor is a thriller. It is a satirical black comedy that makes a valid attempt to show the ultimate futility of a relatively small but influential segment of American society. It does not always succeed, especially towards the end, because the violence ultimately becomes too numbing. This fact does not prevent it from being one of 2000's more original movies, and it does nothing to overshadow the enormous talents of its star and its director.</p></body></html>

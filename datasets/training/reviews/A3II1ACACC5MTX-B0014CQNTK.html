<meta name="summary" content="Juno something? It was OK."></head><body><p>Juno talks like a character in Dawsons Creek, i.e like no 16 year old you ever met, but I thought she was pretty sexy and I wish I was her friend when I was 16. Or indeed at any time. Is that bad? The film is quirky but contrived quirky, its done almost too well, but I chuckled at it, and felt that it was more worthy than my usual DVD views. It was no "Captain Lust and His Pirate Women" though, now THAT was a film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Cluelessness of the British royals revisited"></head><body><p>Director Stephen Frears using reels of archival footage created an insightful pseudo documentary surrounding the drama played out around the British royal family in the wake of the tragic death of Princess Diana.<br /><br />Helen Mirren was at her frumpy and matronly best portraying Queen Elizabeth trapped in the quagmire of tradition in attempting to respond to Diana's demise.  The royals were represented as a privileged and aloof lot severely misjudging the outpouring of emotion of the British people indicative of their affection for the beloved princess.  This was shown most clearly through the heartless response of Prince Philip played by veteran actor James Cromwell.<br /><br />While Prince Charles was played sympathetically by Alex Jennings, the real savior of the Brits was newly elected prime minister Tony Blair played superbly by Michael Sheen.  Blair while wafting through the proper etiquette in dealing with the queen, accurately judged the emotion of the British populace.  The Queen's lack of a public response to the tragedy was eroding her support throughout the country.  New kid on the block Blair advised the Queen to show some unrestricted emotion and compassion, which she ultimately did.<br /><br />The movie featured a myriad of excellent acting performances yet tended to drag as this unforgetable calamity and drama played out before the unobscured view of the television cameras.</p></body></html>

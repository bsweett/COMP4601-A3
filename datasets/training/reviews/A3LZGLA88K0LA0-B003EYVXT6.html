<meta name="summary" content="SPLICE OF LIFE"></head><body><p>SPLICE is of course a Frankenstein for the 21st century and once again warns DON'T MESS WITH MOTHER NATURE!  Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley are excellent in their leading roles, with Oscar-winner Brody showing his versatility.  Delphine Ceneac (sp) is remarkable as the ceature known as Dren, a truly unique "monster".  An interesting albeit predictable script and inspired direction make SPLICE an enjoyable sci-fi movie.  The controversial and predictable ending keep it from 5 stars, but it is a well made film.</p></body></html>

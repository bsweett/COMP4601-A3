<meta name="summary" content="Casino"></head><body><p>Having not seen 'Goodfellas' to compare this to (at the point when I watched this film) I was thoroughly impressed with 'Casino'. A great deal of it is shot with De Niro doing a voice-over, telling the story as he went, which I really liked. The way a casino was run and how it all relates back to mob control was fascinating to see and the various tricks the customers and casino owners use are pretty inventive. Some parts of this film are pretty graphic, as to be expected from Scorcese, but the story overall is gripping and kept me engaged the whole time. The extras disc is excellent, with some great featurettes and bonus material to really add to your understanding of the film. This is a great gangster type movie and brilliantly directed and acted. Well worth a viewing.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

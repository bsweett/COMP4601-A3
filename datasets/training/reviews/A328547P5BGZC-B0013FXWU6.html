<meta name="summary" content="A Masterpiece?"></head><body><p>I bought this 2 disc special edition when it came out.<br /><br />The movie wasn't quite the masterpiece that the critics claim.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis was outstanding as Daniel Plainfield, an oilman! He nailed the role and played the part to perfection.<br /><br />But the movie starts slow and is longer then need be and without alot of serious suspense or action, it never really grabbed me.<br /><br />As far as packaging, I wish they had used the plastic case, but instead opted to use a thin cardboard version. The future of dvd cases, yikes, I hope not.<br /><br />Overall, I would rate this movie a 7 out of 10!!</p></body></html>

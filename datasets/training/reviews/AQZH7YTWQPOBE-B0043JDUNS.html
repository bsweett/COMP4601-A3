<meta name="summary" content="The curse of the sequel"></head><body><p>Sequels are notoriously difficult to pull off. While the first Iron Man was great, this one just comes off as well, a sequel. The plot is basically an excuse to give Iron Man another villain. Unfortunately, this is where things fall apart. Rather than have an interesting plot the builds over time, the film just pits Iron Man against a Russian super genius Vanko who wants revenge against the stark family. I suspect that part of the problem is that Iron Man was simply too powerful in the first movie, so the producers never found a suitable challenge for the hero. Indeed, as far as the plot goes, you could substitute almost any comic book hero and not tell the difference.<br /><br />However, unlike most comic book movies nowadays, Robert Downey Jr.'s (Stark/Iron Man) performance makes up for some of the weaknesses in the plot. His carefree attitude and sassiness are a joy to watch. He personifies the secret desire many of us have to just give the world the finger (in fact, he nearly does do that during testimony before the Senate). The film has some strong moments when Stark realizes he might die soon and struggles with how to live the rest of his life. But these parts are too few and too far in between to save the plot. Overall, I'd give the film 3.5 stars.</p></body></html>

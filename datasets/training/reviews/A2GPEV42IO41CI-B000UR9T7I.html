<meta name="summary" content="Not quite as good as the first two"></head><body><p>When we left Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) at the end of Spider-Man 2, he had not only revealed his identity as Spider-Man to Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), but his love for her as well.  The third installment opens happily enough with MJ starring on Broadway and Pete about to propose.  Of course, sticky situations start popping up right away, beginning with a creeping tar-like substance from space that attaches itself to Peter, changing him from sweet Spidey to mean-spirited Black-suited Spider-Man.<br /><br />This would have been enough conflict to deal with for a very good movie, but, unfortunately, we are introduced to two new villains - Sandman and Venom, as well as pal Harry Osborn (James Franco)'s New Goblin.  The first two films had one villain to focus on, but this is too much; none of the story lines has a chance to develop and the movie gets too crowded and choppy.  Toss in the third retelling of Uncle Ben's death and Bryce Dallas Howard in a thankless role and we end up with a disappointing movie.<br /><br />We do get to see Tobey Maguire show a wider emotional range this time, which is good; he starts as the loveable geek and changes into a conceited and nasty guy who thinks he's a macho muffin, strutting down the street like John Travolta in "Saturday Night Fever."  Dunst is fine as the long-suffering girlfriend and struggling starlet, and Franco gives a strong performance as the loyal pal turned arch villain.  Despite the quality of acting, I felt there were too many characters and subplots to keep track of and too much CGI, which makes it cartoony.  I give this least entertaining film in the series 3.5 stars - unnecessary subplots detract from the overall fun.</p></body></html>

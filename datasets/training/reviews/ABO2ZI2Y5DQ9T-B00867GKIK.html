<meta name="summary" content="(3.5 STARS) Flies But Doesn't Soar"></head><body><p>"Up" is the latest work from Pixar, a company which has given us wonderful animated films like "Ratatouille" and last year's "WALL*E." With each work they release, our expectations naturally get higher and higher. Perhaps this is why I was not impressed with Pixar's "Up" very much. The film flies, but doesn't soar.<br /><br />The best part of "Up" is its opening 10 minutes, where a young boy named Carl Fredricksen meets a tomboyish girl Ellie. They marry, and spend the life together (not without sad moments, however), both dreaming of someday travelling to Paradise Falls in South America. This excellent introductory section almost looks like a stand-alone short film with a very emotional conclusion.<br /><br />The rest of the film is about the 78-year-old Carl and his adventures, accompanied by a very talkative little boy named Russell. Carl sets out for South America in his house floating in the sky using thousands of balloons. Their journey is full of actions, jokes and lessens to be learned - you get chases, visual gags, and even "dog fights" (literally) - and they are always entertaining, if not as touching as the film's initial part.<br /><br />With superb visuals, "Up" remains entertaining throughout, but its story lacks something that draws the viewers into the fantasy world it depicts. This is not to say the film is bad, but with a better storyline and more interesting characters, "Up" would have been a masterpiece.</p></body></html>

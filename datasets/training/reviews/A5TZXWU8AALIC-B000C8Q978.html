<meta name="summary" content="Broken Lives and Forgotten Flowers"></head><body><p>I didn't really care for LOST IN TRANSLATION--I thought it was bland and pretentious--but I was thrilled that Bill Murray got an Academy Award nomination out of it.<br /><br />I'd seen him in 1984's THE RAZOR'S EDGE many times (check that movie out!) and knew he was capable of more than Hollywood was getting out of him.  His supporting role in 1982's TOOTSIE, still one of the greatest comedies of all time, was an early clue.  (His convictions in 1980's disastrous WHERE THE BUFFALO ROAM were right, but everything else in that film was a wreck).  Even 1988's SCROOGED showed a great range.<br /><br />So I went to BROKEN FLOWERS with a lot of hope.  Murray's great in it, if a little understated.  The whole movie has that slow, steady feel to it.  I just wish the film would've included a little of Murray's sense of humor.  It would've explained how he got all these women in the first place (which is never addressed, honestly) and it would've been another aspect of his "loss" as a person.  We're left to decipher his somber expressions to see what's going on inside.<br /><br />The film has moments that teeter just at the edge of inspired lunacy--not slapstick or crude laughs--but surreal and emotional moments of hilarity.  The appearance of "Lolita" perked up the audience I saw it with and generated some real laughs.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is great.  If you run out for popcorn (or blink), you'll miss Tilda Swinton (the Ice Queen from THE CHRONICLE OF NARNIA).  It was fun to see "Nurse Charles" and "Jeff Slater" from TOOTSIE do a scene together, as unnerving as Jessica Lange was in that scene.<br /><br />Look carefully in the end credits for "Homer Murray" for another clue about the son.  It's actually Bill's real-life son.<br /><br />Although I'm not sure what it means to the movie....</p></body></html>

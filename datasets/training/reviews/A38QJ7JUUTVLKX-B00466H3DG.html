I must see this again!"></head><body><p>Let's see, I had no clue what this movie was about, all I knew is that it had Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet, so I figured that I'd go and see it, and I remember being captivated by every second of this wonderful and rather strange film. This is possibly the best picture of the year, and has quickly become one of my favorite films of all time. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is no exercise in existential drudgery. Coming from the bizarre thought processes of Charlie Kaufman, who minted the new mind-game cinema with his "Being John Malkovich" script, "Eternal Sunshine" is as giddy as it is intellectual. And it finally delivers the role Carrey has wanted to play for the last five years. Jim Carrey heads the cast of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, directed by Michel Gondry from Academy Award nominee Charlie Kaufman's (Adaptation) original screenplay. The two-time Golden Globe Award winner is joined in the movie by threetime Academy Award nominee Kate Winslet, Kirsten Dunst (Spider-Man), Tom Wilkinson (Academy Award nominee for In the Bedroom), Mark Ruffalo (You Can Count on Me), and Elijah Wood (The Lord of the Rings). Joel (Jim Carrey) is stunned to discover that his girlfriend Clementine (Kate Winslet) has had her memories of their tumultuous relationship erased. Out of desperation, he contacts the inventor of the process, Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom Wilkinson), to have Clementine removed from his own memory. But as Joel's memories progressively disappear, he begins to rediscover his love for Clementine. From deep within the recesses of his brain, Joel attempts to escape the procedure. As Dr. Mierzwiak and his crew (Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood) chase him through the maze of his memories, it's clear that Joel just can't get Clementine out of his head.

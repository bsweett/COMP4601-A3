<meta name="summary" content="Over hyped and a huge disapointment"></head><body><p>I Am Legend was without a doubt one of the most over hyped and disapointing movies of 2007. Francis Lawerence shows the same mis direction he showed in 2005's Constaine and the script is strictely by the numbers. The only saving grace in the movie is Will Smith's performance as the last man on earth. As for the hyped alternate ending it's also a let down.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An impressive reinvention of the zombie sub-genre that keeps your adrenalin pumping"></head><body><p>I had seen this movie a couple of times and it's just great. The plot is pretty straightforward, even though it relies mostly on clich&eacute; themes to move the story along. So as a rule, most films such as this tend to be predictable and quite tepid. Luckily, `Dawn of the Dead' has strong personalities to fall back on, making it thankfully every bit a character-driven drama as it is a horror-action piece.<br /><br />Sarah Polley convincingly plays a waif turned survivor with just the right amount of emoting. She is strong and vulnerable at the same moment, trying to remain reasonable in unreasonable times. Weber also fits this bill as Michael, a man with a shady past full of regret who tries to fill others with hope while remaining a stark realistic. Rhames' performance clearly commands the most attention. As Kenneth, he becomes the group's de facto leader and top man of action. He keeps the clearest head when trouble is afoot and leads the group out of one scrape after another. Rhames gives the character a silent strength that provides the film with a much needed human edge. I just wished the zombies were bit slower because at times it seem a little bit unnatural of the things that they were able to do.<br /><br />First time director Zack Snyder moves the film along briskly and effectively though, keeping the action scenes tight and the dramatic scenes quiet. There is no heavy-handed sermonizing here that tends to infiltrate most big-budget horror movies -- Snyder wisely lets the images speak for themselves. The horror itself is shocking and grabs your attention, which is a plus considering most of the recent crop of thrillers. The fact that it is happening to sympathetic characters that we care about is another feather in the movie's cap. What really impressed me about this film was towards the end when they took the boat and landed on an island.... Fulci's next zombie flick took place on an island... nice hand off, someone did their homework.<br /><br />`Dawn of the Dead' is a very bloody and terrifying film .Good acting and smart thinking elevates the proceedings among most horror offerings that is dressed to kill. Not as persist as Romero's original (thank goodness), but still one heck of a shot in the arm to cure the memory from most modern horror misfires.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I enjoyed the film up to a point..."></head><body><p>Much better than i taught after hearing all the negatives about this film.<br />Im sure the old series was more serious and better in lots of ways, but this<br />version tries to have fun, have action...have a bit of everything. One of the<br />problems is Seth himself,  great for some scenes, and stupid in others. He has to<br />let go some of the stuff he kept from the comedies he did. I have no problems<br />with Kato, he is always interested in inventing things and can kick ass pretty<br />good. The evil guys are bad but not as sadistical bad as some other. I did welcome this. And the movie cant be that bad as i did'nt fall asleep once looking at it.</p></body></html>

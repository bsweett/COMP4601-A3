Perhaps "Logan's Run", where the underground underclass discovers the real world and runs away to it, is the principal motivation for this film, which is clearly a sequel to a number of earlier flicks.<br /><br />Ewan McGregor is pretty good here in a dual role, in one of which he actually sounds like himself. But he is a shell of the actor that played the lead in "Trainspotting", a truly original movie where McGregor was directed in a way that fulfilled nearly all his capacity.<br /><br />The female lead, played by Scarlet Johanson, is even less realistic or artful. She is mainly given over to smiling in the film's first hour and making outlandish surprise looks after she and the hero find out what's going on.<br /><br />The final verdict on this movie: I watched it Saturday night, thought about all the movies it copied, and didn't remember anything about it Sunday morning. A half-hour conversation with my wife and 18-year-old granddaughter helped me remember enough to write this review.<br /><br />Chalk this up as another episode in the 'oughts (or 2000s or new century) efforts as sequel-prequel making in the movies.</p></body></html>

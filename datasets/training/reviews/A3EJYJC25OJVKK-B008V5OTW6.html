<meta name="summary" content="Spielberg throws a curve ball with "Munich"."></head><body><p>I remember some of the controversy over Steven Spielberg's newest film entitled "Munich" when it was quietly released to theatres. After finally getting to see it recently, I have to honestly say that "Munich" is an incredibly well-done but ultimately thought-provoking movie and ranks among the most `out of the blue' films of Spielberg's career and yet another home run from him and his crew.<br /><br /> It is the 1972 Summer Olympics in the city of Munich in southeastern Germany. The games go smoothly and joyously until on September 9, a vicious band of terrorists who call themselves the Black September, take eleven Israeli athletes hostage.</p></body></html>

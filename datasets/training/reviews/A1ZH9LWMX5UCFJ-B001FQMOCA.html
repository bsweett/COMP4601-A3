I had read Johnny Cash's autobiography and been a fan of his music for years and like others wondered if this film would do his remarkable life justice. I think it does. Joaquin Phoenix does a phenomenal job of portraying Johnny's highs and lows, and Reese Witherspoon absolutely becomes June Carter Cash. I was really happy with the flow of the movie, it did not dwell a lot on the early years his life as the son of a poor sharecropper, but you could tell that he always felt a guilt about the incident that killed his brother at a young age and that (I don't think) he ever thought he got the 'approval' he wanted from his father. Cash certainly had some demons, I think some scenes were not as gritty as they could have been, especially some of his episodes while on drugs, but producers probably did not want to risk getting an 'R' rating. I think this movie will become a classic in years to come and is a must-see for the Cash fan.</p></body></html>

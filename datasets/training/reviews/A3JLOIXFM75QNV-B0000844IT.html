Pretty much everything is awful in this from the effects to the acting, but, who cares?! Its such a mesmerizing movie. I cant even say how many times I've seen this since I was young. I don't own the DVD but I should. It really is a great cheesy classic. And no, I am not being sarcastic. Watch and you will see...</p></body></html>

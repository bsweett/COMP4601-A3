<meta name="summary" content="A very different thriller/mystery"></head><body><p>With some big name stars such as John Cusack, Rebecca De Mornay, Amanda Peete and Ray Liotta, Identity is a thriller which takes on the premise of Agatha Christie's novel And Then There Were None. In this novel, ten people, who all share a secret, are all invited to an island, and one by one they begin to die until the killer is revealed. In similar fashion, in Identity ten people by chance find themselves at a desolate hotel on a stormy night. It seems that strange luck has brought them all together, but, once there, one by one they begin to die. All the characters have vastly different personalities, so you begin to question who the killer is. Meanwhile, while the mystery at the hotel builds, the story flashes to a deranged criminal being questioned by a psychologist about brutal murders. The two stories fuse together, but it may not be as clearly defined as someone thinks.<br /><br />I'll admit that the first time I saw the film; I didn't really understand it or like it. I thought the ending was a little too far-fetched and silly, and felt cheated that much of the other parts of the film "didn't matter" or were rendered insignificant because of those events. However, after watching the film again, I believe there are several aspects that make Identity worthwhile. It is a film that draws you in because just when you are recovering from one mystery, there is another one which enters the scene. Events happen so rapidly that you might find yourself wanting to stop it (just to catch up and mentally take note). Another great aspect about Identity is that it makes you contemplate each scene; you can't really take any moment or scene off mentally, or you may miss something. In this way, it really is a smart thriller. Unlike some thrillers that explain everything away, this is a thriller that does the exact opposite (well, until the end), leaving you to put together all the clues.<br /><br />Whether you like this movie or not, or find it an effective thriller/psychological mystery will depend on whether you "buy" the ending. Things aren't really what they seem, and you have to view the film in terms of two distinct plot lines that only at the end of the film tie together. Those who despise Identity will take the ending to be a stunt; those who enjoy it may see it as a clever technique. We have often seen the thriller and await the twist, hoping to be able to predict it. I must say that Identity is a film that offers two puzzles. At the very least, Identity takes a different course to get to its conclusion, and separates itself in a good way from many of the predictable (blah) thrillers out there. The extra include a few deleted scenes, director commentary, and an on the set documentary.<br /><br />This is a worthwhile thriller to check out.</p></body></html>

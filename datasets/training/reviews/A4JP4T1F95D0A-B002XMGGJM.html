<meta name="summary" content="Some good some bad"></head><body><p>For the most part I was entertained by the film which is a combination thriller/action/horror film.  A man's wife and child are killed during a home invasion.  Instead of justice, the prosecutor(Jamie Foxx) plea bargains the case because he is not 100% sure he can win and in his quest to raise his stature in his firm he wants to keep a high percentage of wins no matter what.  Gerard is not happy with this and is much more than he seems.  Years later he starts to take his revenge on the system and people he thinks betrayed him.  God concept and story holds up fairly well until the totally outlandish ending.  Gerard Butler is terrific both sympathetic and menacing.  Foxx however was so unlikeable in the role I found myself routing for the bad guy the entire movie.  I don't know if it was the script or Foxx himself who brought nothing to his role.  Some pretty gruesome scenes for those who are faint of heart.  This is a good rental.</p></body></html>

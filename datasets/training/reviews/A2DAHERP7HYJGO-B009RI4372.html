<meta name="summary" content="A MODERN HORROR CLASSIC"></head><body><p>There have been tons of horror movies released over the years. Many critics have noted that the horror films run in cycles with the original films eventually downplayed to comic status (note the original FRANKENSTEIN and DRACULA found there way to pairings with Abbott and Costello). That all changed during the 80s when horror films became more of a mainstream favorite and home video took off. Now horror films are playing nearly all the time in theaters.<br /><br />But even those movies don't always elicit fan devotion or repeated viewings. Sure many people have favorites but a true classic stands the test of time and continues to offer goose bumps and nightmare ideas repeatedly. Such is the case with the Sam Raimi directed EVIL DEAD.<br /><br />Released in 1985 (though credits often cite the release date as 1981), the film was a terrifying experience in a theater. I know, that's where I first saw it. The film was released through Thorn/EMI back in the 80s on home video and then bounced around until it ended up at Anchor Bay a few years back. Then Anchor Bay made it one of their staples releasing numerous incantations of the title, everything from special edition boxed sets to bound in the Book of the Dead cover (a main icon of the movie). Finally they've released the film on blu-ray. So is it worth going out and buying the new edition if you own one of the umpteen other ones? The answer is yes.<br /><br />Let's get one thing out of the way first. The synopsis for those who haven't seen one of the many versions. The story revolves around two couples and a sister of one of the guys heading out to the country to enjoy a nice peaceful weekend. Scott (Richard Demanincor) is dating Shelly (Theresa Tilly), Ash (Bruce Campbell who also co-produced) is dating Linda (Betsy Baker) and Ash's sister Cheryl (Ellen Sandweiss) is along for the trip.<br /><br />The five head to the secluded cabin that can only be reached by crossing a dangerously outdated bridge. Once they arrive at the cabin they work on cleaning it up and trying to settle in, unaware of the evil that resides there. It's not until the cellar door tosses itself open and the look in the cellar that things begin to change. They come across an old tape player and a strange looking book that they discover is the Book of the Dead. The house had belonged to an archeologist who had discovered the book and only realized too late that it contained a pathway for demons.<br /><br />So what do they do? Why of course they play the tape that recites an incantation that releases the demons, the first of which eventually possesses Ash's sister Cheryl. But not until after she investigates some noises outside only to be grabbed by wild vines and raped by a tree branch. To this day this scene is still disturbing though not as graphic as many films released today.<br /><br />The night proceeds and each of the cabin dwellers finds themselves attacked or possessed with only Ash tormented from beginning to end and never taken over. The film offers tons of gooey gore, slashed limbs, stabbings, gunshots and oozing gruesome goodies for fans but by today's standards...well yeah it's still pretty extreme at times. So much so that when originally released, the film was attacked in Britain and placed on the notorious "Video Nasties" list for films that were banned.<br /><br />While watching this film I was listening to the new voice over track that features commentary by director Sam Raimi (who later directed the SPIDER MAN movies), Rob Tapert (who went on to produce TV series like XENA and HERCULES as well as most of Raimi's movies) and Bruce Campbell (who went on to star in TV series like BRISCO COUNTY JR and can currently be seen in BURN NOTICE), but in the background I watched the film. Having seen it numerous times I knew what was going on and wanted to hear the new commentary (which was great focusing on how they got the movie made). The thing I noticed while watching was that the movie still held up. It was still a frightening film. I could see that this movie would induce nightmares in younger viewers and perhaps even in some of the older one. It is still one scary flick.<br /><br />And that's why it stands the test of time. That's why even after 25 years the movie is still an experience that will frighten most movie goers. Even sitting in your living room with the TV going it will be a scary movie with certain scenes that will elicit screams. There are few movies that leave images in your brain that you remember later and this is one.<br /><br />One thing that helps I think is that the acting seems pretty good for a group of first timers or actors who had done so little. These people are believable in their roles and that makes the movie that more believable, even when you have severed limbs crawling or demons running rampant. All do a great job and its sad that of those involved on Campbell has gone on to more recognizable roles.<br /><br />So as for the film itself, yes, it is one scary horror film and deserves to be watched over and over again. It won't make a difference how many times you watch; it will remain scary and give you the creeps time and time again. And that's the sure fire test of whether a movie is worth buying or not, if you can watch it again and again.<br /><br />So what does this new blu-ray disc offer? Well first off Raimi supervised the reconstruction of the film from original prints giving you a great 1080p HD transfer. Kind of amazing seeing as how the film was shot on 16mm back in the early 80s. It also offers a choice of aspect ratios to watch it in, either a 1.85 ratio or a 1.33 ratio, both featuring Dolby TrueHD 5.1 audio as well as the commentary track I mentioned earlier.<br /><br />A second disc in the set offers some interesting things as well. The usual cover art/set photos are there for one. It also features some featurettes that have been available in past editions but are now brought together here. These include ONE BY ONE WE WILL TAKE YOU:THE UNTOLD SAGA OF THE EVIL DEAD, THE EVIL DEAD:TREASURES FROM THE CUTTING ROOM FLOOR, THE LADIES OF THE EVIL DEAD MEET BRUCE CAMPBELL, BOOK OF THE DEAD:THE OTHER PAGES, DISCOVERING THE EVIL DEAD, UNCONVENTIONAL and AT THE DRIVE IN. Of these extras, THE LADIES..., UNCONVENTIONAL and DRIVE IN were all made in part a few years back at the Flashback convention held in Chicago where the cast reunited for the first time since making the movie. The three female leads continue to tour the convention circuit now and then under the Ladies of title thrilling fans.<br /><br />So there you have it. A run down on a truly classic fright flick that is bound to give you scares. But make sure you watch it in the dark for full effect. And if you think that watching a scary film like this is made better by seeing it with a crowd in a darkened theater AND if you are lucky enough, it is making the rounds to theaters across the country again for midnight screenings. For die hard fans (sorry if you read this after the date listed) make a point of going to Dixon, IL,  where Flashback is having another celebration of the film and star Bruce Campbell at the Midway Drive In on September 10th and 11th. Campbell will be there as they screen THEY CALL ME BRUCE, THE EVIL DEAD and its two sequels.  You can also find make up effects coordinator and artist Tom Sullivan on the convention circuit, especially Cinema Wasteland in Cleveland. Look for the website of both conventions online for details.</p></body></html>

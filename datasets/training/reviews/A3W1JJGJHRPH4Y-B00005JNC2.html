<meta name="summary" content="It meanders"></head><body><p>The movie meanders skillfully. I do not want to reveal too much of the plot because the timely revelations about the characters are what keeps the movie interesting. The opening scene sets up the story. A man who is heavily medicated finds out that his mother just died. He flies back to New Jersey to attend the funeral. He meets some old friends and makes some new ones. The dialog is good. The friends and strangers are interesting. The movie even takes the viewer to interesting spots in Newark, New Jersey. The movie drives home the point that life is not all happiness, but that's okay. Without experiencing pain, life would be numb and worthless. Real life is in experiencing the pain and the joy.<br /><br />The movie is like a winding path through some valleys and hills. It has some nice surprises, touching moments, and small laughs. This is a very impressive directorial debut for Zach Braff.</p></body></html>

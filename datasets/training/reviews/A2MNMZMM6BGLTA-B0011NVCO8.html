<meta name="summary" content="Good Old School Cop Movie"></head><body><p>I would say this movie is a good companion piece for The French Connection, Serpico and also Prince of the City. I like the movie pretty much from top to bottom and found it to be an old school cop movie like the great ones from the 70's.<br /><br />I recommend it to everybody. I didn't however like that they gave it the 'feel good' ending that they did. I have also read that some of the stuff they commented on at the end about Lucas helping put so many people behind bars was b.s. so that soured me too.</p></body></html>

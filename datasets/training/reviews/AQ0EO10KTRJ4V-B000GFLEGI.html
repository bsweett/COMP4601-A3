<meta name="summary" content="Very Good... but different"></head><body><p>The first thing I have to say about this film is it did not really FEEL like a George Romero film.<br /><br />It felt like somebody trying to imitate Romero's style.... maybe just because it has been so many years since Romero did a film like this.<br /><br />Oddly enough, even though it was a comedy and spoof, I feel last year's SHAUN OF THE DEAD actually captured the Romero feel better.<br /><br />I actually give LAND 3.5 stars because even though they did a good job showing the evolution and advancement of the problem, it did not quite "come together".<br /><br />There was never really a feeling of impending doom like in the other "Romero Zombie Trilogy"...... this one had more of a typical Hollywood feel to it.<br /><br />We never really got a connection with any of the characters or cared about them much.<br /><br />It was all a little "stiff" and did not "pull you in" like the first three in the series.<br /><br />At least I am glad to see the Zombies the way they are supposed to be....slow lumbering masses... and not the olympic runners oj steroids moving as fast as lightening in recent films.<br /><br />The creepiness of Zombies comes from the fact that even though they move slowly, the growing numbers will overwhelm you eventually... that's the "creeping death" and is much scarier than a supposed Zombie that moves like a Mountain lion ....geezzzz.<br /><br />Question........ What happened to the TWILIGHT OF THE DEAD script Romero wanted to shoot for years ?<br /><br />This movie LAND OF THE DEAD (Dead Reckoning) is NOT that ame story from what I gather.<br /><br />Good to see George back.<br /><br />LAND was better than the other attempts out there, but despite the budget, big studio distribution, etc....  it did not quite have the same "magic" as the first 3.</p></body></html>

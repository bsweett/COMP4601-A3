<meta name="summary" content="What was the point of this boring film?"></head><body><p>The Interpreter starring Sean Penn, Nicole Kidman, and the annoying Catherine Keener is such a disappointment to me. I was expecting a classy thriller, what I got a watered-down, pretentious 2-hour bomb. I like Kidman but when was the last time she did a movie that was actually good?! And what is so great about director Sydney Pollack? He is highly over-rated.Avoid this disaster, you will be fast-forwarding this one to end just to see the pointless and stupid ending.</p></body></html>

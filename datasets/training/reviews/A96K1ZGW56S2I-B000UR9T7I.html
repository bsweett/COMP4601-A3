His superhero alter-ego Spider-Man is beloved by New York.  He is thinking about proposing to longtime girlfriend Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). He's also finally learned how to juggle all of his responsibilities between school, work, personal life, and night time crime fighting.  Things seem to be going well.<br /><br />That is until Harry Osborn (James Franco) shows up as the New Goblin and tries to kill Peter.  Their skirmish ends in a stalemate, but threatens their fragile friendship.  Not long after that the police inform Peter and his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) that they have tracked down the second man who was involved in the murder of Uncle Ben.  The suspect is one Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) who during a late night chase falls into a genetic experiment involving sand and mutates into a sand monster. He starts stealing money to provide for his daughter, but is stopped by Spidey.  That doesn't sit well with the Sandman and he promises to make things rough for Spider-Man.  Things become even more confusing when extraterrestrial goo attaches itself to the Spider suit and turns it black.  It gives Peter stronger powers, but also feeds on the darkness of his heart and threatens to overtake and control him.<br /><br />That's a lot going on in one person's life, but that's not all.  Mary Jane is dumped on by the press and fired from her first big acting gig.  Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), a classmate of Peter's, is also making advances and proves a rival for Mary Jane.  Meanwhile, Peter finds himself in a professional photography rivalry with Eddie Brock (Topher Grace). My, my what a tangled web we weave when we first chose Spider-Man to be.<br /><br />Overall, SPIDER-MAN 3 isn't a bad film. It's chock full of action, has a lot of character development, a healthy dose of humor, decent acting, and great special effects.  In fact, the movie has a lot going for it.<br /><br />Yet, SPIDER-MAN 3 isn't as exciting as it should be.  There's just too much going on.  For instance, usually one major villain in a film is enough.  Sometimes you can get by with two, but even then a great deal of character development is lost.  SPIDER-MAN 3 has three major villains who all want Spidey out of the way for different reasons.  SPIDER-MAN 3 also strays more from the original comics than the first two films did.  Turning a comic book into a major motion picture is never easy and Sam Raimi and company did an excellent job at tying everything together. However, in order to get all three villains in and make it all seem semi-plausible, the film strays more than would have been necessary otherwise.  Being a live action comic book film, these things aren't as big a deal if SPIDER-MAN 3 was say, based on a novel.  However, they are still there and drag the film down some.  Therefore, though SPIDER-MAN 3 is a decent comic book action movie that makes a great end piece for this trilogy, the number of elements involved bog the story and pacing down and keep it from being equal to its predecessors.</p></body></html>

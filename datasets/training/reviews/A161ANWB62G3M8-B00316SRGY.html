<meta name="summary" content="One of Clint's best films"></head><body><p>I enjoyed this film a lot. Clint Eastwood does a great job as both actor and director, and the story challenges to viewer - it's not regular Clint fare, but it is both entertaining and moving. The approach to an old man winding down his life, and a young man entering manhood works fantastically. Strong stuff, well worth a view.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906669023">Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys</a></p></body></html>

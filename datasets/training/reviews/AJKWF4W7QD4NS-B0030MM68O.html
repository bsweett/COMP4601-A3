This time around, Bigelow gives the viewer an inside view of the Iraq war with The Hurt Locker, which details the inner-workings of an Army bomb squad EOD unit, led by the newly transfered Sgt. Will James (Jeremy Renner) and rounded out by Sgt. Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Spc. Eldridge (Brian Geraghty).  What could easily fall under the category of being "another war movie" is something that The Hurt Locker is certainly not, as Bigelow puts to use so many great moments of action, suspense, tension, and jaw dropping moments that you cannot help but admire the total package that the film winds up becoming.  Added to that are the performances from all the actors involved, with Renner in particular as the reckless, daredevil, freewheeling adrenaline-junkie soldier whose humanity manages to shine through; this is truly a star-making performance for the actor indeed.  There's cameo roles from Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, Evangeline Lilly, and David Morse as well; rounding out a surprisingly solid cast, but it's Mackie and definitely Renner that steal the show.  All in all, The Hurt Locker is by and far the finest war-related film to see the light of day in some time, and regardless of how you may feel about this particular film genre, missing this film is truly missing out on something special.  Maybe now Kathryn Bigelow will receive the credit and recognition that she has been deserving of all this time.</p></body></html>

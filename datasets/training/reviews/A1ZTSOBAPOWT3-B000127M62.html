I have been dreaming of the day that these two immortals would battle it out to be the supreme being! The count is countless as Jason slashes through Elm Street and folds a bed with a man on top of it! It was the ultimate best when Freddy possessed that young man in the mental hospital and Jason came to cut that stuff in half!

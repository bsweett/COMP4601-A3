<meta name="summary" content="Shallow and a waste of time"></head><body><p>Count me among the minority of reviewers who doubt that this movie has any real merit.  As they've noted, this movie only pretends to wrestle with uncertainty and doubt of a profound form.  Anyone who entertains no doubts with regard to the big questions has fallen under the spell of an ideology; if you need this movie to be awakened to doubt, you've probably been in the grip of such a spell.<br /><br />The main doubt portrayed by the movie is actually a superficial one resulting from witholding information which would provide closure and meaning to the rather simple plot.  The truncated ending (or rather lack of a real ending) is such a fatal flaw that any redeeming qualities this movie has (and there are many) are totally undermined, to the extent that my rating is pushed all the way down to the extreme of 1 star, which is a rarity for me (I tend to be generous with movie ratings).<br /><br />I have no doubt that the 100+ minutes I spent watching this movie were wasted.</p></body></html>

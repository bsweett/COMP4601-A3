He lands in New York, falls in love with Pamela Anderson when he sees her on television, and so he and his producer Azamat make a road trip to meet her in California. This is the only plot of the film, and it is irrelevant to its purpose. Borat has benefited from the truth that there is no such thing as bad publicity. The controversial film will offend just about everyone with its anti-Semitic, racist, misogynist, homophobic, and anti-Christian humor. To me the problem with the film was not its vulgarity, which was plenty bad, but that the film simply wasn't funny, and that's a problem for a comedy. Some of Borat was staged, and other parts were real life ambushes of unsuspecting people; the directors will not say which parts are which. Those who defend Borat argue that it's a clever satire about bigotry; others argue that it aggravates it. Either way, save your time and money.</p></body></html>

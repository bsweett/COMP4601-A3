<meta name="summary" content="As Time Goes By, there is only ever ONE Casablanca!"></head><body><p>Many have tried to remake or duplicate Casablanca.  None have succeeded.  It's not hard to understand why either.  How can you remake one of, if not arguably, the best motion picture film of all time?  The answer is simple: you can't.<br /><br />One of the enigmas that makes this film such an incredible feat, is that throughout most of its production, the story wasn't finished.  They had no idea how it was going to end.  Does Ilsa stay with Rick?  Does she go with Lazlo?  And yet, they obviously found a way to tie the whole story together.<br /><br />I simply cannot think of anyone else to play the part of Rick Blaine, or Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa,  or Claude Rains as Capt. Renault.<br /><br />Eveyone knows the story of Rick Blaine, an embittered saloon keeper who never understood why the love of his life, Ilsa Lund, left him high and dry in Paris just before the German invasion.  He's found his entire idealistic world has been turned upside down.  He claims to care about no one and nothing.  "I stick my neck out for nobody!"  We quickly find out that those feelings of love and fighting for justice have never left, but have simply been buried beneath anger and feelings of mistrust.  Is this ever more apparent during one of the film's most touching scenes, when Rick saves the virtue of the young Bulgarian wife who feels their only chance at leaving Casablanca may be for her to sleep with Capt. Renault in order to secure a visa.  Rick's entire staff goes nuts at this beautiful gesture, which Rick dismisses as a simple gesture to love.<br /><br />It really is fun to watch this film for the first time to see how Rick helps Ilsa and Lazlo.  At first, we are led to believe that he's planning to be selfish and take Ilsa back.<br /><br />Humphrey Bogart is nothing short of magnificent.  He embodies one of the most memorable characters in film history.  We see him in the white coat and black bow tie, running his club with a simple coolness.  Bogart made the trenchcoat and hat a signature outfit as well, not only in Casablanca, but in such films as The Big Sleep and The Maltese Falcon.  He is one of my favorite actors of all time, and Casablanca is probably my favorite role, although it's very difficult to decide which is best out of all of his great portrayals.  Entertainment Weekly had him listed as the best actor of all time and the most entertaining.  It's difficult to argue against this.<br /><br />Ingrid Bergman.  MGM made the right move in negotiating for Ingrid, as she was under contract with David O Selznick.  No one else could have played the part of Ilsa.  Bergman is my favorite actress of all time.  She brings such passion and ease to her roles, and yet she plays Ilsa with a calm, cool sense until she realizes she can no longer deny her feelings for Rick.  She loves Lazlo too, which is obvious, but for different reasons.  Lazlo represents the figure battling for justice and a restoration of a broken world back to what it was.  He inspires Ilsa.  However, nobody has brought out a passion or resevoir of feelings from her than Rick.  We know that Lazlo is often occupied, as what he's fighting for is bigger than himself or even Ilsa.  Rick was once like Lazlo, but Rick devotes his feelings to Ilsa, something that she's never known before.  And ironcially, it is Rick who commits the most selfless act, the most loving act in the end.<br /><br />Claude Rains is one of my favorite character actors.  He's simply wonderful.  He can play any part you put in front of him.  He plays Captain Renault with charm and a man who tries in vain to be neutral, but it is obvious he isn't.  Just look at Renault during his talk with Major Strasser.  As Strasser points out that occupied French territories are "honey-combed with traitors." You catch a glimpse of Renault who is not happy with that remark.  You also catch a glimpse of this during the film's most powerful moment: when Lazlo asks Rick's band to play the Les Marseillaise to drown out Strasser and the Germans as they sing the anthem of the Third Reich. That moment in the film when Les Marseillaise is played is one of the most powerful in all of film history.  It still gives me goose bumps when it is played in the film.<br /><br />Casablanca is simply timeless.  This is, as Lauren Bacall states during the documentary feature, the true definition of a classic.  AFI rated Casablanca as the second best film of all time.  I, personally, put it at the top.  It is more compelling than Citizen Kane, in my opinion.  Everyone remembers Rick and you often find yourself visiting Rick's Cafe Americain over and over with repeated viewings, because you simply never get tired of watching Casablanca.  At least, I don't.</p></body></html>

The film takes place in a massive space craft called "The Nostromo". The unsuspecting crew members receive a distress signal from a nearby planet named "LV-426", and decide to investigate. Upon landing, 3 crew members; Lambert, Kane and Dallas, venture off into the planets bleak, barren atmosphere where Kane, is attacked by a "face-hugging" spider-like creature which attaches itself to his face. Although he is in need of medical attention, Officer Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is hesitant in letting them back inside. Science Officer Ash, disregards Ripley's concerns and let's them in. And so the fun begins as the "face-hugger" dies and a silent, omni-potent killer quickly develops inside the unwary victim's chest, waiting for the right moment to make its grand entrance and to wreak havoc on board "The Nostromo".<br /><br />"Alien" is one of the best science-fiction films ever made. The acting from the ensemble cast is first-rate as is the script, direction and the film's pace is virtually flawless. Even during scenes in which nothing much is happening, the dialogue and interaction among the cast is crucial to the films plot. In other words, there is not a single scene that isn't relevant to the film.<br /><br />James Cameron's "Aliens" (1986) follows. This installment has Ripley being rescued 57 years after the events of the first film. Ripley's story of her alien encounter is met with skepticism since the "LV-426" has been colonized and the colonists have never come across any alien life-forms in the 20 years they have been on the planet but when communication from the Colony is lost, Ripley is asked by Carter Burke, if she can return to the "LV-426" alongside several Colonial Marines. Ripley turns them down at first but soon realizes that these creatures must be destroyed. In order for this to happen, she has to go back. Ripley is assured by Burke that their mission is to annihilate the aliens. Once there, they discover a desolate planet in ruins and one survivor; a young girl named "Newt" who Ripley takes under her wing but their struggle for survival is made even more difficult when Burke's egomaniacal plot is exposed and the hordes of vicious, blood-thirsty aliens come out to play.<br /><br />This sci-fi classic offers non-stop action, outstanding performances (Weaver and Bill Paxton are especially delightful) and the climactic finale is riveting. Definitely one of the best sequels ever made.<br /><br />"Alien 3" (1992) opens with Ripley and her crew, in cyro-sleep inside their ship. A "face-hugger" is among them and causes a disruption aboard the spacecraft. They are ejected from the vessel and crash land on "The Fiorina 161", a maximum security prison. Ripley is the lone survivor. She asks that an autopsy be performed on her crew members and when the autopsy shows no signs of alien contamination, Ripley is somewhat relieved. However, a "face-hugger" also survived and by using a new host, an alien queen is born. Despite being in a maximum correctional facility, there are no weapons of war-fare available, so Ripley and the convicts have no means of protection against the ever evolving species. When Ripley comes face to face with the alien invader, she discovers there is more at stake then she originally thought.<br /><br />"Alien 3" (1992) is not on the same level as it's predecessors but on its own, it's a decent thriller that delivers the goods despite too much talk and unlikable characters. Like all the films featured here, "Alien 3" is presented in both a "Theatrical" and "Expanded" version. The latter has over 30 minutes of restored footage which changes a couple of key elements of the "Theatrical" cut. I personally prefer the "Expanded" version.<br /><br />"Alien: Resurrection" (1997) takes place 200 years after the episodes of "Alien 3". Lieutenant Ripley is dead. Using her alien-contaminated DNA, a team of scientists decide to create a Ripley clone in an attempt to reconstruct the alien species. After cloning a near perfect "impregnated" Ripley, they extract the alien from inside her for studying and decide to keep the Ripley clone for further testing. The new Ripley has several unusual characteristics; abnormal strength, concentrated acid for blood, and she appears to have a close kinship to her alien broods. The aliens, on the other hand, are kept within securely built confinements, constantly being scrutinized by the scientists. These new breed of aliens are more intelligent and when left alone, they execute their escape plan. Fully aware that their acidic blood is capable of melting steel, they viciously slaughter one of their own creating an acidic blood-bath that eats right through the floor of their confinement. It is up to Ripley and the crew of the newly arrived "Betty" to try to destroy the blood-thirsty predators that are roaming within the ship.<br /><br />Despite having some ridiculous plot twists, the performances in "Resurrection" are up to par and the film delivers the gory goods. There are plenty of gruesome deaths, state-of-the-art visual effects and the aliens themselves are impressive, especially the "Queen" (her birth sequence is one of the film's highlights) but it's clearly evident at this point that the franchise has run out of steam and fresh ideas.<br /><br />This exquisitely packaged box set includes 9 DVD's in total; the 4 films, each with it's own bonus DVD and the 9th DVD includes even more bonus material. Each film is presented in Widescreen format in both a "Theatrical" version and an "Extended" version with "deleted" scenes restored and Audio Commentary. The films are given impeccable treatment in picture and sound. If that weren't enough, a booklet is also enclosed. Fans of the series should not be disappointed since this is one of the most comprehensive box sets ever released. They really did the series proud with this one; highly recommended.</p></body></html>

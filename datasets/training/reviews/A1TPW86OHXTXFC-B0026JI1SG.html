Now, what is the rule?<br />Maggie Fitzgerald: Protect myself at all times.<br />Frankie Dunn: Good. Good."<br /><br />Clint Eastwood has starred and directed the movie of his life. Well, not his life, but a marvelous movie; deep, moving, loving, sincere, brutal, telling and humorous at times. This is s story of a boxer, Maggie Fitzgerald from a poor southern town with not much of a future to look forward to. However, she wants to be a boxer. She never did explain that, but meeting her family I would have become a garbage collector to get away from that crowd.<br /><br />Clint plays Frankie Dunn, owner of a gym and trainer in that gym. Maggie Fitzgerald is Hilary Swank, and what a Maggie she is. Morgan Freeman is a retired boxer and all around good man at the gym. Into and around the gym come all sorts of people,  young, old, talented and crazy men wanting to play the fight game. And, of course, in comes Maggie, Frankie finally decides to train Maggie, and in 18 month she has knocked out most of the women boxers she has met. This is an undeniable group of scenes. But the real kicker, the real start of the story arrives with the next set of scenes.<br /><br />I am not going to spoil the ending or the near ending except to say that this is the part of the movie that makes it great. This is what makes a good movie, and this is what makes Clint Eastwood, the director he is, and Hilary Swank the Oscar winning actress she is.  You could miss the first half of the movie and still understand the ending. Great movie. Not for the faint of heart, but recommended highly. prisrob</p></body></html>

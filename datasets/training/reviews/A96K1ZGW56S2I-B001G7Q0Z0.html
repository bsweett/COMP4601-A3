<meta name="summary" content="Rewriting History."></head><body><p>BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES is the fifth movie in the PLANET OF THE APES series. It's a decent movie, but could have been much better with a bigger budget.<p>The movie takes place several years after the ape revolt and after mankind has almost destroyed itself by nuking cities around the world. Caesar has established an ape city several miles outside of what was once New York City. In Ape City, apes and men coexist but not as equals. Men are subservient to apes and Caesar says it will stay that way until he can trust the "race of man", not just a few individual humans. The climax of the film occurs when mutants attack Ape City in an attempt to restablish human supremacy.<p>The movie itself is an average 1970s film. The movie illustrates how the apes were just as destructive as humans. However, this latest edition of BATTLE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES tries to rewrite the Apes mythos by leaving out a crucial scene. This version of the film leaves out the scene where the remaining mutants begin worshiping the Doomsday Bomb that destroys the world at the end of BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES. This version of the movie ends with a scene of The Lawgiver teaching to a group of ape and human children leaving the viewer believing that history had been changed, when in actuallity it had not.<p>Overall, an average movie, but the weakest of the APES movies.</p></body></html>

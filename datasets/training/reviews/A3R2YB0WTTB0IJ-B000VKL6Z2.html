<meta name="summary" content="ROB ZOMBIE, OPUS 3"></head><body><p>****1/2 2007. Written and directed by Rob Zombie. Remake of the first HALLOWEEN movie directed by John Carpenter in 1976. The film is really a very good surprise and has a life of its own. The dysfunction of the Myers family and the symbolic relation between Michael and the mask figure are an undeniable contribution to the HALLOWEEN myth. Congratulations, Mr. Zombie ! A DVD for your library.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Tenacious D Frontman Takes A Chill Pill & Traverses The PG-13 Frontier Ala AC/DC"></head><body><p>Being a fan of Tenacious D and having seen some of the twisted stuff jack Black has done in the past, having him in a movie full of small children is at first off-balance and slightly sinister.  Is this the guy that wrote FHG?  Is this the twisted dude that stared in the short-lived HBO series about being a lunatic rock demigod suffering in obscurity with his bro K.G.?<br /><br />Well...sure it is, but a kinder, gentler Jack Black, like the one we glimpse in King Kong and saw so long ago in Shallow Hal.<br /><br />Sponge extraordinaire and underground rock God in training Dewey Finn is struggling with his band and his muted rock genius as well as his roommates new girlfriend who wants him to stop sponging and start paying some rent.  He gets kicked out of his own band for his onstange antics and ultimate lameness.  Things really suck.  A phone call from a Prep School for his roomie Ned is intecepted by the Finn and bingo, the plan is hatched.  Horace Green needs a substitute teacher for a few weeks and Dewey needs some Benjamins (money).  How hard could it be?<br /><br />Dewey become Ned and takes over a classroom full of overachieving brainiac Yuppie larva.  Boredom ensues until, by chance, Dewey overhears his students wailing away in music class.  What is going on?  He's got a group of potential rockers in his grasp and The Battle Of The Bands is drawing near.  Time for a little class project.<br /><br />School of Rock is charming and funny in all its little ways.  Jack Black is insane and hysterical and filled to the brim with rock lore.  My kids and I both liked it.  Is it the greatest movie ever?  No.  Is it quality entertainment.  Probably.  Who really knows what passes for quality entertainment anymore.  But I did find it fun & there are a lot of rocking tunes from AC/DC and Zeppelin and even a little blast of Metallica thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />Dig it!</p></body></html>

The "MONSTER" looked like a plastic toy.  The "PLOT" was pretty simple and plodding (as well as predictable).  I guess I could take one of my rubber toys, magnify it a couple of times and make a movie myself to much acclaim.<br /><br />By the way, why was this piece of junk called "The Host"?  Why wasn't it just called "The Fish" or something that made sense. What really got me was that a review on the cover of the DVD compared it favorably to Jaws. What a lie!!  Thank goodness that I borrowed it for free from my local library - if I had paid a penny, it would have been war.</p></body></html>

Defeated and driven before him, the various tribes and smaller nations face imminent extinction or subjugation before the ferocious army Memnon controls.  Every day brings more bloodthirsty warriors to fight under Memnon's standard.  In a last-chance bid to stand against the cruel king, one of the tribal elders hires a trio of the last Akkadian mercenary warriors.  For the blood price offered, the Akkadians agree to steal into Memnon's city and assassinate the king's sorceress.  Getting into the city is dangerous work, but Mathayus and his companions manage-only to be betrayed.  Just as Memnon is about to put Mathayus to death, the sorceress interrupts.  She says that Mathayus can't be killed by the king's hand or one of his men.  Instead, Mathayus ends up staked out in the desert, up to his jaw in sand as dreaded fire ants are riled from their holes.  Knowing the fire ants will kill him and eat the flesh from his bones, Mathayus makes a deal with a horse thief to free him.  Once loose, Mathayus returns to Memnon's city ready to wreak unholy vengeance.  However, fate conspires against the Akkadian warrior, and before he can take down Memnon, he must find and raise an army of his own.<p>Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is a legend among WWF fans, but he's also starred in THE MUMMY RETURNS, setting up the role he plays in THE SCORPION KING.  The Rock has also made guest appearances on STAR TREK: VOYAGER, THAT `70S SHOW, and THE NET.  Michael Clark Duncan got an award nomination for his stint as John Coffey in THE GREEN MILE, but got his start bodyguarding stars and musicians.  He's also been in PLANET OF THE APES and ARMAGEDDON, and has the role of the Kingpin in the upcoming DAREDEVIL movie.  Versed in the martial arts, Kelly Hu got her start as Melia in GROWING PAINS, then had roles in FRIDAY THE 13th PART VIII: JASON TAKES MANHATTAN, THE DOORS, then recurring roles on NASH BRIDGES and MARTIAL LAW, and has a role in the upcoming X-MEN 2.<p>As an action-adventure flick goes, THE SCORPION KING sings with violence, amazing fight choreography, and splendor that would rival an Old Hollywood period piece.  The Rock comes across very believably as Mathayus, one of the last Akkadian mercenary warriors, and a solid romantic lead.  His swordplay gleams and flashes, and his hand-to-hand combat are top-notch from all the WWF battles he's had.  The opening montage of action to set the movie into play is a blistering riff of everything the viewer has in store.  Kelly Hu, barely dressed throughout the movie, is simply gorgeous and carries her role as Cassandra easily, layering her performances in so that she underscores the action and the emotion.  Grant Heslov-playing Arpid, a horse-thief-steals the show upon occasion much as did Kevin J. O'Connor in THE MUMMY and THE MUMMY RETURNS.  The pacing of the movie remains frenetic throughout, driving the viewer from one incredible scene to another.  Filmed entirely on location in California and in sound stages at Universal Studios in Burbank, THE SCORPION KING is a feast for the eyes, holding settings that look like they were only recently uncovered from the desert.  The final battle between hero and villain is awesome, captivating with intensity, and fraught with some real peril (The Rock actually had his eyebrows singed when the flaming swords got too close to him, as revealed in the DVD features).<p>Well done as the movie is, there were a couple of spots that needed better editing.  Viewers never find out how Arpid escaped from the sand when he was buried up to his neck, and during the climb up the side of the building in Chapter 16, the wire-walking was entirely too obvious because the Rock's body remained too far out.  It would have been nice to see Kelly Hu kick (literally) loose with the martial arts she made look so good in MARTIAL LAW.  Also missing from the story (although it was deliberately done, according to director Chuck Russell), is a supernatural overtone.  Magic actually played a very small part in the overall scheme of things. <p>THE SCORPION KING is an absolute must for the action-adventure fan, as well as people who loved the first two MUMMY movies starring Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz.  Anyone looking for a solid popcorn movie, a no-brainer that has action, thrills, and a good-natured sense of itself, can slip this DVD into the player and enjoy.</p></body></html>

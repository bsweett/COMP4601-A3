<meta name="summary" content="One of best ever made"></head><body><p>This is one of the best films ever made, a comedy worthy of Voltaire or Cervantes, and a thriller to rival the best Hollywood ever produced.  I'm willing to bet this movie will be remembered long after most of the movies of the Twentieth Century have faded to oblivion.<p>Part of the inspiration for Kubrick's satirical masterpiece came from the publication in the fifties and early sixties of such absurd academic tomes as Herman Kahn's "On Thermonuclear War" in which the author assured us that nuclear war was not only survivable, but even winnable, and at any rate we could recuperate.  Consequently he became one of the focal points of Kubrick's satire, embodied as Dr. Strangelove, the scientist with the arm-jerk Nazi salute and Nazi mentality, played chillingly by Peter Sellers, who also played U.S. president Merkin Muffley and British Air Force Captain Lionel Mandrake.  Kubrick and Terry Southern, who wrote the rapier-sharp screen play, proved profoundly prescient when it was realized some years later that nuclear war really was not winnable because it would usher in a "nuclear winter" that would becloud the entire planet for months or years to come, bringing starvation and death to billions. By making Dr Strangelove a Nazi, Kubrick was looking back, imagining, as we all were in those days, what horrors would have befallen the world had the Nazis gotten the bomb instead of the U.S.  Start World War II five years later and we'd probably have Hiroshima in Chicago.  Making Dr. Strangelove a Nazi also allowed Kubrick to allude to how the Nazi scientists were incorporated into the Soviet Union's bomb-building arsenal after WW II.<p>Part of the effectiveness of the movie is how it is dramatically presented as a comedic thriller.  As the Strategic Air Command planes are flying toward the Soviet Union to drop their bombs, the tension is emphasized and prolonged by the long, almost languid conversation between a very relaxed Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) ... <p>One of the reasons this movie is still vital even though the Soviet Union has disbanded, is that it almost happened.  During the Cuban missile crisis in the early sixties, Kennedy and Khrushchev came perilously close to nuclear warfare.  Kubrick, Terry Southern and cast are to be commended for showing us the incredible folly of the age of MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction).</p></body></html>

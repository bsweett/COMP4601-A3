<meta name="summary" content="(3.5 STARS) 'Transporter 2': Better Actions and Faster Story"></head><body><p>Jason Statham comes back as the titular professional `Transporter' Frank Martin, whose cool attitude in the face of danger reminds me of Bruce Willis in the 80-90s. One great thing about `The Transporter 2" is, unlike the overblown sequel of `Die Hard," it clearly knows what it wants to, or should do, for the action flick fans, providing nicely done stunts of shoot-outs, car-chases, and martial-arts fighting. Though the story penned by Luc Besson is nothing but borrowed ideas from `Man on Fire' or any other action films that features one tough guy and a bunch of stupid cops, `Transporter 2' surely delivers its goods, and faster than before.<br /><br />Two things are changed in the format of the original: one is the location that is moved to Miami. The other is that this time Frank's client is a rich American family, and what he carries is a little boy. Like Denzel Washington's world-weary hero, he is hired as a chauffer, but the difference is Frank has Jet Li-like physical agility that is seen in the opening sequences. In short, no one mess with him.<br /><br />Actually, someone messes with him when the family sends the boy to a doctor's. The killers including Kate Nauta's deadly assassin with lots of make-up in short pants show up before him, demanding that the boy should be delivered to another place. From then on, the fast-paced film shows lots of actions in succession without stopping a moment.<br /><br />[STATHAM RULES] `The Transporter 2' solely belongs to Jason Statham, who is truly in character. Always calm and stoic, Statham's Frank never lets you down, with the action hero quality that is rarely seen in Hollywood. Of course, behind the thrilling fight sequences is stunt choreographer Corey Yuen, and the use, or overuse of CGI is disappointing (and some of them are, to be honest, shockingly cheesy like a flying chopper), but Statham's presence makes up for the weakness of the film.<br /><br />But some demerits should be pointed out, and they are many. Besides the ineffective special effects, the supporting actors leave much to be desired, especially Matthew Modine and Amber Valetta as the parents of the boy, whose constant overacting bored me to death. Jason Flemyng appears as Russian killer, but his acting is a poor copy of his Jikyll turn `The League of the Extraordinary Gentleman,' and Kate Naura looks gorgeous but is quite empty. Alessandro Gassman's baddie is worse, with laughably heavy accent, which is just a stereotyped image of Latino youth.<br /><br />`Transporter 2" is an exciting movie experience as far as Jason Statham stays on the screen. Though the story often looks ridiculous, even stupid, the actions are better than average, well worth the money you may spend on this one.</p></body></html>

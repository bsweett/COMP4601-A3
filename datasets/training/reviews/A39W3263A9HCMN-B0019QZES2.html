<meta name="summary" content="4.5 stars! Not as great as the first but a damn fine movie!"></head><body><p>We went to go watch this in the theater. We had low expectations and once I saw the words "Meet the Fockers" on the screen, I knew I was in for a treat. This wasn't as great as "Meet the parents" but I LOVED IT!!!<br /><br />In this movie, Greg (or Gaylord) Focker flies over to his girlfriend. He then learns that they had a baby. Then they all go to Miami to visit The other Fockers.<br /><br />With a sexualized dog, Sex-addicted parents, and other hilarious moments, you'll laugh through the whole damn movie! You'll have a hell of a damn funny time!</p></body></html>

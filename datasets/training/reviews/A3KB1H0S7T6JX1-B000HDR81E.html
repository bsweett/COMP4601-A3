<meta name="summary" content="There's something familiar here..."></head><body><p>The Break-Up sheds light on a Chicago couple that takes a lovers' quarrel a little too far than was originally intended.  It is a film that most people can relate to and that is what makes it so dear.<br /><br />The plot has elements of both comedy and drama making it rather difficult to label it as one or the other; it's actually a bit of both.<br /><br />It is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.<br /><br />Vince Vaughn, Jennifer Aniston, Jon Favreau, and the rest of the cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!<br /><br />In short, it is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!  4 1/2 Stars</p></body></html>

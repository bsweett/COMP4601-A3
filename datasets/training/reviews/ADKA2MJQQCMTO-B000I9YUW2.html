<meta name="summary" content="Forgettable"></head><body><p>A pretty decent preformance by Moore, a great first-half, and some genuine "jump" moments just aren't enough to save "Forgotten" from itself.<br /><br />Without giving anything away, "Forgotten" takes a left turn in the second half that's so severe and so ridiculous that it's hard to take seriously anymore.  At that point, a decent story is driven straight into the ground.<br /><br />There simply wound up being one too many moments when I found myself saying "They can't be serious?"</p></body></html>

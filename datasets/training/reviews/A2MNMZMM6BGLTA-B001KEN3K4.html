<meta name="summary" content="Carell as Maxwell Smart"></head><body><p>I thought this movie was pretty funny. I was a fan of the origional Get Smart and loved Max and 99 back in the day. This movie is a good companion piece of that show and holds up on its own. I also like that Max wasn't portrayed as a Xerox copy of the Don Adams Maxwell Smart. Ann Hathaway is also really good as 99 but portrays her as more of a tough as nails hardcore kick butt sexy agent. The Rock is pretty good but nothing great. I also am a huge Alan Arkin fan and thought he did a good job. Also the little tribute to Hyme was a nice touch.</p></body></html>

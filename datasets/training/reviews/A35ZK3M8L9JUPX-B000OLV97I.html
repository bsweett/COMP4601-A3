<meta name="summary" content="Eragon"></head><body><p>A boy named Eragon finds a polished blue stone in the forest. At first, he thinks it's a lucky discovery, something that will bring meat to his poor family for the winter. Instead, it brings a dragon hatchling, and Eragon is soon thrust into a world of magic and power through which he and the dragon must navigate. I loved this movie. This movie is perfect for a family with children of various ages.</p></body></html>

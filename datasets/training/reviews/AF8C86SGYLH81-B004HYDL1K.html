Take a simple plot such as "closing the borders" and turn it into a thriller...with comedic undertones and lots of GORE (but not overdone).  Robert Rodriguez is at his best.  If you recall, he also directed "Terror Planet"...the first of a double feature on the "Grindhouse" DVD...and "Sin City".  "Machete" is much better...a great cast...lots of beautiful women...shoot-em-up scenes...revenge...twists...and special effects.  How can you miss with Danny Trejo as "Michete" and a supporting cast of Jessica Alba, Robert De Niro, Jeff Fahey, Steven Seagal, Cheech Marin, Don Johnson and (yes) Lindsay Lohan.  All 5 stars...but don't let the kids watch this one...too much violence, realistic revenge, and adult themes.  Put the popcorn in the microwave...have a bottle of beer or glass of wine...and enjoy the ride.</p></body></html>

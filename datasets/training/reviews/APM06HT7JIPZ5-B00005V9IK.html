INDEPENDENCE DAY is one of the best movies I've ever seen; I can't think of one single flaw in the film.  Casting is perfect, music is spectacular, and special effects . . . . . . . they simply define the term &quot;special effect&quot;!  No matter how many times I see this movie, they're still just as mind-boggling.  It's no wonder they won an Oscar for them.<p>INDEPENDENCE DAY is nothing short of a miracle.  It takes a plot that had essentially been told countless times throughout the past fifty years, upgrades it with all that has been previously mentioned (along with nerve-wracking suspense and simple, wholesome humor), and turns it into a modern masterpiece of epic proportions.  In my opinion, it should've won Best Picture of 1996!<p>The two-disc Five Star Collection DVD is one of the best ever made.  The making-of documentaries are insightful and very interesting, the &quot;mocumentary&quot; is pretty entertaining, and the menus are just plain awesome!  But the best part of this DVD is the movie itself, as it includes nine minutes of footage not seen in theaters.  Every single new scene/addition brings more depth, characterization, and humor to the story.  The picture and sound quality is nothing short of flawless.<p>It's a real shame this DVD is out of stock on this website.  GET AHOLD OF IT BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY!</p></body></html>

For a start, the animation has been polished to within an inch of its life - the colours and so forth are extremely vivid, and although released in 1937 you can't tell from the film quality alone (the music and the 'look' of Snow White and the Evil Queen are very 1930s, however).<br />As the above list indicates, there are rather a lot of extras. As with Lucasfilm, Disney often get a lot of bad press for being stingy -  this is Disney's equivalent of 'Star Wars: Behind the Magic', in that they've gone to the other extreme and including almost anything possible.<br />Disc two has a couple of afternoon's worth of stuff, highlights of which include the various trailers dating back to 1937 ('See what the genius of WALT DISNEY has created!') and some galleries of concept art. It's odd looking at galleries of concept art from the 1930s - the animation and storyboarding 'work in progress' frames don't seem dated, and some of the throwaway pre-production illustrations are as gorgeous as anything in the film.<br />The menus are very nice, but as with a lot of flashy menus (the ones for MGM's 'James Bond' films) they get a bit tiring the second time.<br />There are deleted sequences, some audio clips, shots of live action test shots, short films on animation presented by Walt himself (looking surprisingly dapper), the works. There's even a short history of the Disney company itself, a piece of fluff which skims over the studio's dimishing artistic fortunes after the death of Walt, and has a blankly-smiling actress sum up the 80s as 'a decade of agressive investment and expansion!' and not, say, 'a decade of 'The Black Cauldron' and 'Tron''.<br />Disc one has the film, Barbra Streisand (for two minutes), some games, and an intriguing audio commentary by Walt himself, assembled from bits of interviews. It's a bit muddy and hard to hear, but that's definitely his voice talking. I haven't actually listened to it all the way though, but it deserves a nod for the effort involved (unless, of course, it's all faked and Walt isn't really dead at all).<br />To top it all, it's reasonably-priced. As a landmark in cinema, and as a classic Disney film, I can't think of a reason not to own it.</p></body></html>

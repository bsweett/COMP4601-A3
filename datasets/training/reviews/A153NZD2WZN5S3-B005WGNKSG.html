<meta name="summary" content="Sexy Beasts"></head><body><p>A nice movie of an investigative journalist and his assistant  -a bi-sexual girl with a dragon tattooed on her whole back-  hired to solving a forty-year-old mystery of a disappeared young female, a member of a rich clan in rural Sweden, disclosing intentionally or by-a-way racist anti-Semitic mafia realities of this so high-flying kingdom, and such a rare revelation added, perhaps, to the work's hit status worldwide.<br /><br />It is a really nice low-budget film sliding into a fair-tale at the end, at least a dramatic rescue of a journalist and his later voyage to Australia while awaiting a start of a jail term sure examples of are.</p></body></html>

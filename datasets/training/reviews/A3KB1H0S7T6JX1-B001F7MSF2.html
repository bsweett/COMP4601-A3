An ancient armistice between humans and elves is about to expire as the prince of the elves feels that their adversaries have encroached unto their realms and are in the process of destroying nature and the environment.<br />There are slight hints of the Lord of the Rings and strong elements of X-Men and Men in Black so the movie falls into the action/adventure category.<br />What is very interesting about the movie is that the "villain" is not all that bad and he is in fact right in a lot of what he says and stands for.<br />Ron Perlman and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least, though Luke Goss and the lovely Anna Walton, as Prince Nuada and Princess Nuala respectively (the chemistry is AMAZING), steal the show! Moreover, the setting, the plot, the dialogues, the special effects (!!!), and the music are all wonderful!<br />In short, Hellboy II: The Golden Army is a film definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection! Looking forward to the next one!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great story, but oh-so-tediously told"></head><body><p>While this ostensible "spy thriller" is clearly more of a serious drama with something important to say, Eric Roth's chunky screenplay and the stellar cast would've been much better served by some of the kineticism you find in a more disposable version like Tony Scott's "Spy Game". The sad history of the CIA and the destructive impact of misguided patriotism on personal relationships are depressing enough as it is without the lugubrious pacing director De Niro insists on giving them here. There are one or two great scenes, but you might easily sleep through them. Matt Damon is surprisingly bland in a weird, one-note performance that lacks any capacity to evoke empathy, and is completely at odds with the character arc the film apparently tries to trace. This probably accounts, in large part, for why so many have found this film unengaging. It's a shame, because the story it tells is an important one.</p></body></html>

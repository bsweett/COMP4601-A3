<meta name="summary" content="Brosnan's MOONRAKER because it sure ain't THUNDERBALL"></head><body><p>The last and weakest of the Brosnan Bonds. Bad CGI, a lackluster theme by Madonna -- whose cameo isn't long enough for her to do any real damage to the film.  The plot in some ways recycles the Goldeneye devise with more power, Tobey Stephens as a billionare who is really a North Korean agent (!), and a waste of the talents of Halle Berry and Michael Madsen.</p></body></html>

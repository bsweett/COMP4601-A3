<meta name="summary" content="Zack Snyder's masterpiece"></head><body><p>Seeing this in the theater on opening day was probably one of the greatest movie experiences in a lifetime. It's unfortunate that this movie had a 75% drop in its theatrical run after a successful opening, but not every movie is #1 5 weeks in a row, right?<br /><br />Watchmen is based on a graphic novel by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons. It's a very well done adaptation. I've read the graphic novel twice, so I was excited to see this movie.<br /><br />And what an awesome movie it was!<br /><br />I was a bit skeptical about the almost 3-hour length (I don't have A.D.D), but in the end I was completely satisfied. I saw it with 3 people who hadn't read the graphic novel, and they even loved it too. I was very shocked though that there were kids at this movie, as if the rating 18A for "Gory Scenes, Brutal Violence" wasn't enough of a warning?<br /><br />The year is 1985. Nuclear War is a high threat. The doomsday clock has been set to 5 minutes to midnight. And an ex-superhero has been murdered. The Comedian (played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan), has been thrown out a window to his death. Upon this happening, the minutemen, now called the Watchmen, a washed-up ex-ensemble of superheroes has reunited to to one thing- save the world from nuclear threat.<br /><br />Watchmen is a brilliant movie. At 2 hours and 43 minutes it doesn't overstay its welcome. In fact I actually didn't want it to end. The entire cast was brilliant. The movie isn't as humorless as everyone says it is, there's lots of dry humor where appropriate, there is lots of action, and another thing is that it fits the "problems of society" feel that the comic created. Also the omissions were not as bad as people are exaggerating it to be- I must admit I liked the changed ending a lot better than the book ending. It's more realistic, and I must admit the book ending made me go "WTF".<br /><br />I shall warn you though, this movie is very violent and gory. I am a gorehound, and I found myself cringing and going "Ewwwwww" at a few bits. Do not see this if you are squeamish, because it IS very brutal and gruesome stuff.<br /><br />So overall, I have not one single complaint about this film, because it's an amazing work of art. This is brutal and and gruesome stuff that if hard to watch, and I love it. Consider it Snyder's masterpiece! I can't wait to get it on Blu-Ray when it comes out!</p></body></html>

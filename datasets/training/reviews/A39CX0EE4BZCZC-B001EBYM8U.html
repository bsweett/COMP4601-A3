<meta name="summary" content="Denzel's Definitely Different In Here"></head><body><p>A departure from being the normal good guy made this Denzel Washington movie a bit different.....and unpopular with a lot of his fans when it was released.  I found it a very intense story of two Los Angeles cops: one being a veteran corrupt one "Alonzo" (Washington) and the other a rookie, honest one "Jake" (Ethan Hawke).<br /><br />This is a bit sordid at times, with over 100 f-words, but was almost mesmerizing at times and hard to put down once the film started.<br /><br />I don't know if this is a realistic look at the crime areas of Los Angeles, but if it is, wow: pretty frightening. Washington's viewpoints, however twisted with this particular character, made some sense in parts, sad to say. Overall, not a pleasant film but certainly an interesting one.</p></body></html>

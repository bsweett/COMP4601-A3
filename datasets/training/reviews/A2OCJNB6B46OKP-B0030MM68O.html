<meta name="summary" content="Something new."></head><body><p>There many movies that have depicted the world of war. The past has given us a very glorified, Hollywood picture. Movies from 'All Quiet on the Western Front' to 'Inglorious Basterds' have show us good vs. evil, fancy dialogue etc. War is always taken out of context in cinema, but there are very few that give us something real.<br /><br />'The Hurt Locker', now known as the best picture of 2009 is one of those movies that is not bent on giving us a glorious picture, rather they strip war down to its true, gritty roots and in this movie we see the mental anguish that soldiers go through in modern day war. This movie takes us into the lives of a battalion that has been sent into Iraq to patrol the streets in search of terrorists and suicide bombers. In the middle of their rotation they are given a new squad leader that is a bit off color when it comes to the seriousness of their cause. He is unruly and at times treats it like a game. While some would consider characteristics such as this offensive because of the real people out there today fighting this war, there is some realism to those actions. There are people that have gotten so wrapped up in this war they try to turn into something else just to keep going as they battle the enemy. The film is very tense and at times not for the faint hearted. Still, it is not suppose to be war is real and war can make you feel all sorts of emotions you never thought you had inside you. One of the things that I appreciated about 'The Hurt Locker', was the fact that not all Arab people are depicted as bad, and that those who happen to be good in nature are thrown into terrorist acts against their will and sometimes they lose their own lives.<br /><br />'The Hurt Locker', is not meant to be a cinematic legend in its field, nor was it made to be one of the greatest films of all time. I feel this movie was created to send a very important message about the war we are currently fighting and war in general. We have brave men and women who fight for freedom and a movie such as this one is here to show us, maybe not accurately, how they go about their daily lives on the battlefield. More importantly, it shows how all that these souls want to make sure that in the end they are able to go home.</p></body></html>

My wife told me that he was in a version of "Little Women" sometime ago.  I've also seen him with smaller parts in other films.<br /><br />In "Equilibrium," Bale takes center stage as John Preston, a top cleric in Libria who hunts down "sense offenders."  These "sense offenders" range from people who read poetry and novels, study art, or enjoy the occasional musical piece.  In other words, anyone who shows any sort of emotion is dealt with swiftly and deadly.  Also, if you skip your dosage of Prozium, an emotion dulling drug, you risk facing death.<br /><br />All of this emotion control is done in hopes to render any ideas of revolution moot.  After the third World War, balance is brought about by removing art, music, etc. so that no one gets any crazy ideas.  Of course, there are some folks who want to feel.  These people, including one fellow cleric, manage to get under the skin of Bale.  Bale slowly begins to lose his emotionless nature and begins to cherish things such as rainbows and puppies.  He begins to care for human life and worries for the safety of his children.  Eventually, he is recruited by the revolutionaries to lead their revolt on "Father," a Big Brother-type who controls what is considered good and what is considered bad.<br /><br />Bale goes from emotionless puppet to a vengeful, angry man.  Though some may find his love of a puppy and the lengths he goes to in order to save its life a tad silly, you have to see the situation through his character's eyes.  The best example I can give is when you see a deaf person "hear" for the first time using a hearing aid.  They usually begin to cry tears of joy and pain all at the same time.  Something very similar occurs to Bale when he hears music for the first time.<br /><br />Taye Diggs provides a smarty-pants foe to Bale's Preston.  Angus McFadyen plays "Father" with sinister flair.  Both Emily Watson and Sean Bean have small but significant roles and they put their whole hearts into their respective characters.  The rest of the cast is very good, though most of them are simply "sweepers" and revolutionaries who fight violently and often.<br /><br />The story moves at a steady pace and really picks up when Bale begins to show a little too much emotion around Diggs.  The action is brilliant, especially the gun-kata.  Others have compared this film to "The Matrix," but I see nothing in "Equilibrium" that wasn't copied by "The Matrix" and vice versa.  Let's be honest folks, the whole "Matrix" story and things not being as they seem has been thrown around for centuries.  It's all been done before in countless books, plays and films.  What it all boils down to is good versus evil and in the end, good prevails.  Stop with the comparisons already!<br /><br />Anyway, watch this film if you really enjoy action-packed sci-fi that is a little bit more intelligent than most of the shoot-em-up sci-fi we are treated to these days.  The acting is way better than a lot of other flicks out there these days.  The action is fun to watch, and you will actually pull for the good guys in this one.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Better Than "Memento" and "Following""></head><body><p>Much as I enjoyed Chris Nolan's "Following" and "Memento", he really pulls out all the stops with this third film. I saw the foreign film upon which this was based and, unusually, this is the better film.  (Usually American remakes of foreign films are total schlock but that is not true here.)  It has some key ingredients for achieving this though.  First off, a first rate script that no one has "Hollywoodized." Secondly, letting Al Pacino and Robin Williams loose with their talents on first rate material and, in Williams' case, against his usual type, was sheer genius.  The two are absolutely superb together.  Pacino is the anti-hero cop who investigates a murder case in Alaska while trying to cope with a partner (Martin Donovan) who is going to turn state's evidence against him when they return to LA.  Not only will this ruin his career but it might also release all the murderers Pacino's character put away in prison. The partners are trying to track down the villain, Williams.  Surprisingly though, instead of running, Williams' villain comes forward and plays with Pacino's character, preying upon his weaknesses.  Pacino is further handicapped by not being able to get any sleep because of a variety of factors but not the least of which is that he's not used to sunlight 24/7 which occurs in Alaska in the warmer weather.  Martin Donovan and Hillary Swank do very good work as the other detectives but it is hard to compare them against the sheer star power and magnetism of Pacino and Williams together. The murder case is actually not as important as the unravelling of these two men's characters.  Buy it. I did and it's not going anywhere!</p></body></html>

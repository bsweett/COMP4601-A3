<meta name="summary" content="The greatest film of our time"></head><body><p>I can't believe it's taken me this long to see 'The Godfather' but now that I've finished I feel complete in a way, like I've acomplished something.  I guess that may be that up until this point I didn't know why so many people LOVE this film, and now that I have experianced it I can agree with the masses that you rarely watch a film as COMPLETE as 'The Godfather'.  By that statement I mean that, from start to finish, every line spoken, every scene shot, every moment caught on film feels just right.  Nothing feels contrived or forced, nothing feels out of place or 'added' but everything feels natural and, well, perfect.  Now I really don't know what to say...I mean, how do you review a masterpiece.  It almost feels wrong to say anything but "see this movie if you haven't already" for fear that something you say will take away from the film, but I will try my best.  First of all the story is classic, and no, I have not read Puzi's novel, but I have decided to order it and will read it shortly, but the story regardless if you've read the novel is still gripping.  Marlon Brando, in his most critically aclaimed role, plays 'Don' Vito Corleone, the head of his mafia family.  The story follows as the Don is asked by the Tattaglia family for his aid in trafficing narcotics throughout New York.  Now Vito is a man of the old country, and he believes narcotics to be a dirty business and so he refuses, politely, to aid the family.  This causes problems, and after the Don is attacked and hospitalized his family struggles to exact their revenge while taking care of the responcibilities their father can no longer tend to.  Vito's son's all take seperate approaches to the crime.  Sonny (James Caan) is hotheaded and placed in charge in his father absence.  He wants to strike while the iron is hot sort-a-speak.  Tom Hagen, the Corleone adopted son (Robert Duvall) is the sensable consultant to the family (and family lawyer) and he advises Sonny to take his time and think things through.  If he strikes fast and hard he may bring upon them the vengence of the other mafia family's.  Michael (Al Pucino) is the youngest son, and up until this time he had nothing to do with the family business, and he had no desire to get involved.  He has just returned from war and is courting Kay Adams (Diane Keaton), but when his fathers life is placed on the line he has a change on heart and exacts his revenge on the Tattaglia's resulting in a feud or war between the family's and causes Michael to flee to Sicily for his safty.  Events take place over the years that take a toll on the family, but the strength of the Corleone's pulls through and by the end of the film, as Michael realizes his place in the world and becomes the new 'Don' we, the viewer, understand the importance of this film and the power it holds.  From beginning to end there is only perfection.  I can't say anything more, and quite frankly I shouldn't have to.  Watch this movie for there is no film that even comes close to this film...probably the most deserving film to ever walk away with the top honors at the oscars.</p></body></html>

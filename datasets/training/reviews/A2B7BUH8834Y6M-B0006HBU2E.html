I can tell you, you don't have to have seen it to enjoy the sequel, since there is enough of a quick synopsis to let you know the scoop on what is going on. Bourne and his girlfriend are living out their lives in Goa, India by the beach. They are 2 of the very few white faces in town and stick out like sore thumbs. Even though they've been there quite a while, they haven't even picked up so much as a decent tan to try to blend in. A dubious Russian character plants Bourne's finger print in a conspicuous place after assassinating a CIA informant and the person the informant was trying to buy documents from in Germany. While the CIA tries to track down Bourne, the Russian goes to Goa to finish him off so that it will all look like a good clean tie-off to the intrigue - the film never explains how  the Russian traced him to India - but his blonde hair and blonde girlfriend do stick out there, after all.<br /><br />Are there holes in the plot? Sure - but everything happens so fast, you really don't notice until hours after the movie as you try to absorb everything you experience during the film.<br /><br />The language is not paint-peeling like most films today and there is no nudity or sexual activity. There is a lot of shooting, one person gets strangled to death, another drowns and many many cars get crashed all over the place. The camera play is so on target, you feel like you are in the car with Bourne as cars go zig-zagging and spinning inbetween other cars. I was literally on the edge of my seat during most of this film.<br /><br />The action is stimulating enough to appeal to the low-brow crowd and intellectually stimulating enough as to not put those with higher brain functions into a coma. My heart was beating like crazy during this film, as I felt like I was more of a participant than a viewer.<br /><br />Bourne's character is something else - he is apparently fluent in German, Hindi & Russian as well as English - and perhaps fluent in other languages as well. He is a good shot, an incredible defensive driver, sensitive, loyal, decent, articulate and just an all-around good guy who has been done wrong by many levels of government. Unlike James Bond, who is supplied by Q with the latest in technological gadgets, Bourne can make-do with anything he finds if he has to, and he doesn't have to go bed-hopping to do it. Move over, James Bond, you've met your match!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="'Up' Goes Just There for Another 'Pixar' Gem"></head><body><p>`Up' is another Pixar gem.  Able to transport the minds of young and old and enhance its story with sympathy and charm, the movie is understandably touted as one of the year's best.<br /><br />Since the beginning of their marriage, Carl Frederickson (Edward Asner) and his wife Ellie (Elie Docter) have yearned to move to Paradise Falls in South America.  Smitten by his childhood hero, explorer Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer), Carl and Ellie scrimp and save, but contingencies force them to open their savings jar until one day Ellie passes away, and Carl is forced to live alone with his dream broken and nothing but his memories intact.<br /><br />Around his house construction workers are building new city buildings, and a job foreman coaxes Carl to sell his house.  One day Carl confronts a worker who damages his mailbox, and the ordeal sets Carl up to be placed in a nursing home.  Carl then meets a young boy scout who wishes to earn his final merit badge, assisting an elderly person.  The boy gets more than he bargained for as Carl desperately tries to regain his footing and elude those who would change his life forever.<br /><br />Colorful and cute, Carl's journey and the characters he encounters are enough to enthrall, but the story is even more transporting.  The peril is enough to keep even teenagers interested, yet keep their sympathies for the elderly intact.  The way the animated scenes unfold is the most engrossing aspect of yet another successful Pixar project.</p></body></html>

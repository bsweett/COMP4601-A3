It also makes so much of its political time, with resonances beyond the 1950s.<br /><br />I remember seeing a screening of this at a theatre in downtown Chicago in 1974.  There's a scene where "the Professor," the CIA operative played by Leo G. Carroll, remonstrates with Cary Grant.  Grant is being manipulated into continuing to help the CIA (or some other "alphabet soup" agency) conclude its actions against a spy ring, and Grant wants no part of it.  He's then told that his love interest (Eva Marie Saint) is an operative who is in grave danger - placed there by her work for the CIA.  The Professor says, "War is hell, Mr. 'Kaplan,' even if it is a cold one."  Grant replies, "Well, maybe we should start losing a few of them."  The 1974 Chicago audience cheered out loud.<br /><br />So, here we are today - not 1957, not 1974, but 2005.  Watch this movie after Team America and get the joke Hitch put out for us almost fifty years ago:  good and evil will coexist within all political, religious and social infrastructures.  Power corrupts.  Absolutism leads to demagoguery.  What counts is interpersonal relationships and, most of all, trust between people.<br /><br />Great film - airplane sequence is cool, too...</p></body></html>

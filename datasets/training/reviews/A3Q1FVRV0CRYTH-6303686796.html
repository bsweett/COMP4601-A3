Telling the twisted tale of Travis Bickle, a deranged ex-marine who drives cab and obsessive over two different women, `Taxi Driver' succeeds in both getting under your skin and getting into your head.  A lot of discussion is to be had over the conclusion of this film, so I won't really go into it (it's a major spoiler to any who have yet to see the film anyways), but there is also much to be said about the film in it's entirety as well.<br /><br />The lead character of Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) is one that may be hard to understand at first, but he's someone I found to be so relatable it's almost scary.  Travis is a confused soul, someone who obviously hates what the world has become and more notable what he's become to the world.  This is made obvious by the way he lies about himself in letters to his parents, making himself appear much more important than he really is.  He's also someone so concerned with mattering that he presses upon others his unwanted help in order to validate his reason for existence.<br /><br />This is first seen in the way he pursues Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), trying much too hard to impress upon her that they are meant to be.  The second is found in the way he tries to save the young prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster).  It's not so much in the fact he wants her to have a better life but the way he goes about downgrading her in order to prove his point.  He's so disgusted with the world and its views but he in a sense is just as bad in the way he treats those he interacts with.<br /><br />So here's what I mean by Travis being `relatable'.  We all want to matter and we all want to make a difference, not just in our lives but for the most part in the lives of others as well.  The only problem is that rarely do we ever go about things the right way; most of the time we try so hard to fix problems we see that we in turn become part of a bigger problem.  That is what befell our anti-hero Travis here, for his intentions were pure but his actions were tainted.<br /><br />`Taxi Driver' will always be known for De Niro's brilliant performance, and rightfully so.  He became Travis Bickle in every sense of the word.  He was as creepy and eerie as one can be, but also as endearing and almost pitiful at the same time.  A breakout role for Foster is here as well, and Cybill Shepherd really shocked me with her performance as well.  Harvey Keitel comes off a bit amateur next to De Niro's commanding screen presence and Albert Brooks as well as the late Peter Boyle aren't given roles meaty enough for them to stand out, but regardless no one here even begins to take away from the film and that alone is a major plus.<br /><br />We may not all agree on the meaning behind this film, the power it holds or the moral the ending offers, but we can all agree that this is film making at its finest and deserves to be praised for that if nothing else.  Martin Scorsese, probably the greatest director to be SNUBBED of the Oscar year after year, made his name with this film, proving to the world that he had a point of view that needed to be heard!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A must for any Ape fan"></head><body><p>It's really nice to get all 5 PotA movies in one DVD set, and the price for this is actually pretty reasonable, especially given that you get a bonus DVD with extra material. The first one was the best, hands-down, but unlike so many sequels today which turn out to be complete swill, the four sequels are all fun and interesting on their own.<br /><br />The case itself looks nice, with the logo and the ape picture on it. I could go on and on about how great the movies are or this set is, but honestly, all I need to say is that this set is a definite must-have for any PotA fan</p></body></html>

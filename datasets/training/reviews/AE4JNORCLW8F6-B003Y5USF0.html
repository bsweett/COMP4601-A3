<meta name="summary" content="An action thriller that's actually thrilling."></head><body><p>Even though some segments of Twister are a bit unrealistic, that's ok. The action and special effects are spectacular and the acting and character development are great. From the very beginning, the movie grabs your attention and doesn't let go until the very end. This isn't a documentary, so there are plenty of scenes presented for dramatic effect. That's ok by me. This is a fun, intense, emotional movie full of everything a disaster movie needs. Right up there with The Towering Inferno and The Poseidon Adventure, Twister will keep you in your seat, following every chase.</p></body></html>

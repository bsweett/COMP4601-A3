<meta name="summary" content="And the moral of the story is........"></head><body><p>Okay, this was a flat out creepy movie. But, very brilliant!!!! The story is very simple and gets straight to the point. A killer named Jigsaw is bent on teaching his victims to appreciate what they have in life, the hard way!!!  Especially, two victims that are chained together in a rundown warehouse. Now, the two victims have to figure out their connection together or else. One of the victims can kiss their loved ones goodbye. Like I said, very creepy. But, good!!!!</p></body></html>

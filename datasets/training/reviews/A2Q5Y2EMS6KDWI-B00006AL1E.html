<meta name="summary" content="One of the most magical, endearing & funny movie trilogies"></head><body><p>I originally had the trilogy collection on separate VHS tapes; what a joy it was when DVD re-introduced the "Back to the Future" series in a crisp, digital format. Several years later, these films have not lost their charm. Director Robert Zemeckis labeled BTTF "special-effects comedies", but they seem so much more. What's more enchanting than the notion of meeting your parents when they were in their teens? That's what teen Marty McFly (the terrific Michael J. Fox, at the height of his "Family Ties" TV fame) finds out in Part I as he's catapulted back to the innocent 50's in a Delorean time machine devised by his spastic but brilliant scientist friend (Christopher Lloyd, wonderfully quirky on a variation of "The Nutty Professor"). Doc Brown's warnings of "drastically altering the time continuum" get turned on their ear when Marty accidentally does alter the course of events leading to his parents falling in love, and that's part of the fun of the first film as Marty gets into close scrapes with bully Biff (a solid comic performance from Thomas Wilson) and fending off uncomfortable amorous advances from his Mom-to-be (Lea Thompson, in top form). Like Lloyd, Crispin Glover (who was in the first film but was replaced by "look-alike" actors appearing briefly in long shots for the sequels) is perfectly cast as Marty's nerdish loser father George. Part II is intricate & clever; perhaps TOO clever at times, because it's just as imaginative but lacks the heart of Part I. Picking up where Part I left off, Doc Brown whisks Marty & his girlfriend Jennifer (Elizabeth Shue filled the role in the sequels, riding a crest of success at the time with "Adventures in Babysitting" & "Cocktail") away to the near future to help correct events which will destroy their family & marriage. Marty's purchase of a sports almanac once again demonstrates what happens when you change history--this time, with darkly disastrous effect. What follows might be a first in movie sequels: Revisiting key events from the first film as Marty & Doc try to mend the time line by returning to the 50s. You have to admire the minds who came up with such cleverness. Part III brings the series full circle as it returns the charm of the first film--except the surroundings are different. After the flying Delorean gets zapped by lightning, Marty learns that Doc Brown is alive & well...in 1885! With the help of the 50's Doc, Marty goes back to rescue Doc from a fatal shooting by Biff's great grandfather, "Maddog" Tannen. A sweet but unexpected subplot twist has Doc falling in love with another science-minded person (Mary Steenburgen) which winds up complicating their journey back to the present. Both sci-fi & westerns are blended together here, capped with a dazzling FX-laden train ride as Doc & Marty attempt to "push" the Delorean through the time barrier.<br />There are many, many joke references to cultural icons & "how time repeats itself" which are stitched through the fabric of each film. Included are "making of" featurettes on each film. BTTF will remain one of my favorite movie trilogies!</p></body></html>

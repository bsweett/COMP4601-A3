<meta name="summary" content="One of a kind movie"></head><body><p>A patrol is captured in Korea and the plot to the Manchurian Candidate begins.<br /><br />Fears of brainwashing, then seen as a weapon of communism, were genuine. During the Korean War normal, patriotic American Soldiers captured by the enemy were seemingly turned, willingly providing statements on behalf of their captors. Psychologically, this was largely the result of torture and mental pressure provided by the communists. But at the time people had to wonder... how far could it be pushed?<br /><br />The scene where the soldiers of the patrol have been placed in a hypnotic state is absolutely brilliant, mixing reality and the perceived reality of the two groups involved. The nightmares and almost reflexive responses given by some of the Soldiers after their return was very well done as well. The directing of the film and the way visuals were used to show differing points of view of the conditioned Soldiers and even the mixing of the reality and the perception as the subconscious mind attempts to deal with what has happened is so wll done as to be a model for future films (if there are any) on the subject of brainwashing.<br /><br />The cast in this film was brilliant, especially Frank Sinatra who had proven by this time to be a very good actor as well as a skilled singer.<br />The DVD's use of the Red Queen in the menu setup is a nice touch and served to bring all the material together.<br />An all-time classic.</p></body></html>

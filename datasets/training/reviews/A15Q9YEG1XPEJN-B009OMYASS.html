As horror films go, it is below average. This is a far superior film to say....Friday the 13th, but a pitiful film in comparison to the German film "M" (from 1933). Why? Because MODERN horror films don't actually use HORROR (definition: creating a sense of fear or dread), but rather go for the cheap scare: gore and shock. Bill Cosby once said, "It is very easy to get people to laugh at dirty jokes, because they make them uncomfortable. It is much more difficult to get people to laugh at clean humor." The same can be said for gore and shock. It is much easier to get a reaction to them than it is to create an overall sense of fear and dread.<br /><br />Hostel, at times, does create a sense of fear and dread, but not in its scenes of gore and torture, but rather in the anticipation of those scenes.<br /><br />Two American college aged young men and one man a bit older (from Iceland) are partying hard in Amsterdam as they backpack across Europe. They admit to having no interest in seeing the sites, but rather in being as randy as possible and participating in as many acts of debauchery that they can. This is the first mistake of the filmmakers. Since the three lead characters are not morally redeemable, it is hard to feel sympathy for them...with possibly one exception: Josh (Derek Richardson). Josh is quite possible a virgin and his friend Paxton (Jay Hernandez) is making it his job to see to it that Josh gets "lucky". While he does, in fact, get lucky, it would seem that Josh very possibly has feelings for Paxton beyond just good friends. When Josh gets bumped off, his is the only character we feel sympathy for.<br /><br />While in Amsterdam, the guys find out that there is a youth hostel in Slovakia where the women will do anything sexual with anyone who wants it. Lame premise...but supportive of the naive and stupid tourists who would believe that anything goes in a former Soviet block country.<br /><br />This is possibly the film's greatest strength. It capitalizes on the uneasy and unsure subconscious fears of the Western world regarding the old Soviet block countries. Sure, they're the new "wild west" where anything goes, but that can also include the bad with the good.<br /><br />The three guys head to Slovakia and this "hostel not in any guide book". When they arrive, the hostel appears to be more like a four or five star hotel where they have to share their room with three beautiful girls who remove their clothes at the drop of a hat. In fact, the first half of the film is a veritable "boob fest" in that more women run around topless in this than in most hard core porn films.<br /><br />The guys get lucky immediately, but because we know that the hostel is is front for something far more sinister, we are actually allowed to fear for the characters just what is going to become of them. This is the one factor of the advertising campaign for this film that does its job.<br /><br />Once the second half of the film begins, the story switches to a very gory version of "The Most Dangerous Game", where men pay big money to torture, mutilate and kill other humans.<br /><br />I don't think I've given too much away, but to tell more would be giving away the simple plot. Is there redemption? I'll let you be the judge. Is it more than a simple gore film? Not really. Is it amateurish? No. The acting is decent and the scenery and the special effects are quite....realistic.<br /><br />The DVD has almost no extras beyond various commentaries. This isn't Citizen Kane, so I just wanted to watch the film. Thus this sort of "extra" is, to me a waste of time - ego stroking on the part of those involved.<br /><br />It's an inevitable film. One that will surely have sequels. And since you know you'll want to see them, go ahead and get this film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""The Punisher" is the first great action thriller of 2004!!"></head><body><p>I just checked out "The Punisher" at the theater a couple of days ago, and let me just say that the film was action-packed from pulse-pounding start to heart-stopping finish! The direction of Jonathan Hensleigh (screenwriter for "Armageddon") was nothing short of excellent or intense! This new version of "The Punisher" was, without a doubt, way, way better than the old 1989 Dolph Lundgren version, especially since this popular Marvel comic-book adaption explains more of the Frank Castle character in-depth, etc. The performance of Thomas Jane ("Dreamcatcher") as Frank Castle/The Punisher was extraordinary! The finest performance of Jane's career! The performance of John Travolta ("Get Shorty"), back in bad-guy form as Castle's villainous counterpart, Howard Saint, was electrifying and powerful! Travolta's best villainous performance since "Swordfish" and "Face/Off"! Rounding out the cast are Rebecca Romijn-Stamos ("X2: X-Men United"), Will Patton ("Entrapment"), Roy Scheider ("Jaws"), Laura Harring ("Mulholland Dr."), Ben Foster ("Liberty Heights"), and Samantha Mathis (Travolta's "Broken Arrow" co-star), in which they, too, gave unforgettable performances alongside the two leads!<p>"The Punisher" puts the focus on Frank Castle (Jane), a man who has seen too much death in his life, first as a former Delta Force operative and later as an undercover FBI special agent. He has managed to beat considerable odds, and is finally moving out of the field and into a normal life with his wife, Maria (Mathis), and young son, Will. On his final assignment, Castle plays his undercover role perfectly, but the operation spins out of control and a young man, Bobby Saint (James Carpinello), is inadvertently killed in the process. The end result places the FBI on the wrong side of Tampa businessman Howard Saint (Travolta) and his glamorous wife, Livia (Harring). Notwithstanding their glossy social profile, the Saints are no genteel Florida couple; behind their copious wealth are violent beginnings, underworld ties -- and a chilling capacity for brutality. Inflamed by the death of their son, the Saints are willing to risk their newfound legitimacy on a wholesale mission of blood-vengeance. Castle's worst nightmare is about to come true, as Howard Saint and his lieutenants unleash hell at the Castle family reunion, with Maria and Will killed in the process.<p>But Castle, to his everlasting torment, survives. Until this moment, he has spent his entire life adhering strictly to the law. However, experience has taught him that the law cannot adequately penalize the people who murdered his family. Drawing upon all he has learned in 20 years, Castle sets in motion a plan to punish the murderers. He takes up residence in a dilapidated tenement building in Tampa's industrial district, where his fellow tenants include Joan (Stamos), a waitress at a nearby diner who is trying to put her life back on track; Dave (Foster), a gangly twenty-something with a face full of piercings; and Bumpo (John Pinette), a rotund gourmand who rarely leaves his home.<p>In preparing his revenge, Castle thoroughly familiarizes himself with the habits and routines of the Saint family. He traces the movements not only of Howard and Livia, but also their surviving son, John (also played by Carpinello), and Howard's second-in-command, lawyer Quentin Glass (Patton). Armed with this essential knowledge, Castle launches his first salvo against Saint's business interests. Stunned that Castle is not only alive but causing him harm, Saint marshals his forces in an attempt to shut Castle down permanently. He soon turns to the underworld's network of hired assassins, recruiting the laconic Memphis legend Harry Heck (Mark Collie) as well as the blonde behemoth known only as the Russian (WWE superstar Kevin Nash).<p>Castle's plan is proceeding apace, but his mission has the unintended effect of placing his fellow tenement dwellers in danger. Yet Joan, Dave, and Bumpo rally for their neighbor, even at great personal risk. This makeshift family -- forgotten men and women with no one to protect them -- brings Castle the one thing he least expects: redemption. His personal goal achieved, Castle realizes that his life's work has just begun. As The Punisher, he will provide justice for ordinary people and exact retribution from society's villains.<p>In conclusion, "The Punisher", to me, is a whole lot better than recent Marvel comic-book duds as "Daredevil" and "The Hulk"! Also, "The Punisher" has it all: lots and lots of action that keeps you on the edge of your seat, powerful storyline, some laugh-out-loud humor, and a pulsating soundtrack! "The Punisher" is an absolute DVD must-have to any collection when it's released!</p></body></html>

Well, it can from time to time, but there is also so much beauty in the world that is right front of you; all you have to do is open up your eyes and see it. Watching &quot;The Green Mile,&quot; I felt my eyes open as wide as they ever had. I left the movie theater with a new appreciation for everything I was given. Sure, I give in to the natural desire to complain once in a while, but not as often as I did. Very few movies can make you feel this way. &quot;The Green Mile&quot; does. Adapted from the six-part serial novel of the same name by one of the great authors, Stephen King, Frank Darabont brought another uncommonly powerful work of King's to the screen with such depth and emotional resonance that by the end of the movie, there isn't a dry eye in the house. Once Tom Hanks, in a terrific performance as Paul Edgecombe, loses it, so do we, and we wear our tears proudly. How could we not, after all, if a seven-foot-something miracle of God such as John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan) can? There are many moments in &quot;The Green Mile&quot; that are worthy of a standing ovation, and one in particular that makes your chin slam into the floor harder than I think most everyone's did at the end of &quot;The Sixth Sense,&quot; but the soul of the movie lies in the relationship between Hanks and Duncan, whose performance is as much being as it is acting. There is a reason why the Best Supporting Actor race last year was so hectic, and it was because performances like Duncan's were in the running. This movie works in so many ways on so many different levels, and despite its three-hour running time, every minute of which is entertaining, it never falters. The ending of the film could've been trite, but there is one thing that saves it: The inspired monologue that gets us to comtemplate our own lives, and what we have done with them. &quot;Sometimes the Green Mile seems so long,&quot; Paul Edgecombe says in his 108-year-old voice. Use your time wisely, watch &quot;The Green Mile,&quot; and live.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="a tour-de-force performance by Farrell"></head><body><p>starts out as Farrell's strolling down the block talking on a cell phone, talking to his pal, then he goes to a phone booth and calls Katie Holmes, whos hes seeing on the side, then it becomes really good with Kiefer on the other line, tempting Farrell not to hang up or leave or he will be sniped down. Then there's these hookers and their pimp and the pimp gets shot and the police come and the cameras. Farrell's wife comes. (Radha Mitchell( Pitch Black and High Art). Farrell gives a good shattering in the phone booth performance, but the ending is sort of like, WHAT!!!, buts its a good flick</p></body></html>

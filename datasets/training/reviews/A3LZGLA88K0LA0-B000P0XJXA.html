Just who or what is vague and only after the movie is into its crux do we understand a little what's going on.  The complex David Mamet penned plot finds Val Kilmer as a determined secret service man who is challenged to find out who has abducted the daughter of the US President.  He is paired with one of his trainees, an eager Derek Luke, who comes in and out of the movie, and once out completely, never mentioned again.  William H. Macy and Ed O'Neill are around to play high level aides to the President.  The plot is complex, and at times confusing, but the style of the movie is interesting and Kilmer offers a solid enigmatic performance.  Kristen Bell who plays the daughter is very good in her brief scenes, but the movie ends on a downer, but how else could it end?<br /><br />Not an easy movie to watch, but not as bad as some other reviewers made it out to be.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Formulas for Happiness and why they Crumble"></head><body><p>A half a century ago migration from the noisy high-powered success of the city to the serenity of the suburbs found the path of REVOLUTIONARY ROAD a common one.  Richard Yates' novel about the fragility of married commitment in 1955 has been very successfully transformed to the screen by writer Justin Haythe, director Sam Mendes and a perfect cast of actors.  All of the soured expectations of that period gel in this superb film - a movie that is difficult to watch at times, mostly because it rings so very true.<br /><br />Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) and April (Kate Winslet) Wheeler move to Connecticut from New York when the addition of children to their lives of thwarted expectations alter their once dreamy plans for their future.  Once in the 'just perfect' little suburb and living in a just perfect little house sold to them by real estate agent<br />Helen Givings (Kathy Bates) - who has a grown son John (Michael Shannon) who is in a mental institution and has undergone multiple shock therapy treatments that allow him to see things as they are no matter how cruel or rude his views - Frank settles for life in the Knox Business Machines Company, reluctantly following in the footsteps of his father while April attempts to rationalize her dreams of being an actress by appearing in an unimpressive amateur theatrical group.  From the opening frames of this claustrophobically suffocating new life the once happy couple shows signs of deterioration of a marriage.  The manner in which they couple attempt to dramatically change their boring life is destroyed by the realities of their situation: another pregnancy plays a significant role in the downward spiral of Frank and April's future and we as viewers are forced to watch the castle crumble.<br /><br />Winslet and DiCaprio are excellent in the lead roles, offering the type of sensitive acting skills that pull the audience into the film.  The supporting roles by Kathy Bates, Michael Shannon, David Harbour, Richard Easton and Kathryn Hahn are cameos worthy of praise.  Every aspect of the film recreates the 1955 era and in some ways that 'distance' makes observing the film emotionally more tolerable.  This is a sad story that has no redeeming end.  Well worth the attention it has received.  Grady Harp, June 09</p></body></html>

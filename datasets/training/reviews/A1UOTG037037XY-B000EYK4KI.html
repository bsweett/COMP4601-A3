<meta name="summary" content="The unrated version is the chick flick version."></head><body><p>The unrated version shows more scenes of their home life and more long slow shots of Angelina Jolie which really show how amazing looking she is.  I didn't like the theatrical release version at all.  It seemed like a rushed collection of action sequences and smarmy one-liners.  I didn't receive the second disc that comes with the unrated set so I can't comment on it. If you want a slightly slower version and you really want to lock onto Angelina Jolie's face, then this version is the one for you.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Award Winning Performance by Cheadle..."></head><body><p>This gut wrenching movie is based on the true story of Paul Rusesabagina, a five star assistant hotel manager in Africa who spent his life being accommodating to the rich, famous and powerful clientele of the hotel Mille Collines in hope that one day he could call on them to help his family.<br /><br />All hell breaks loose in 1994 just before the president is assassinated. Following this begins the unbelievable genocide raged against the Tootsis people. Paul has to think fast on his feet to keep his wife and children alive (they are Tootsis, he is Hutu). His actions surprise even himself. Without expecting it, Paul becomes a humanitarian, saving over 1000 refugees by hiding them in the hotel while over 800,000 Tootsis were being slaughtered.<br /><br />The act of killing so many people seems incomprehensible. Hotel Rwanda's disturbing content deals with the dark side of humanity. It did not try to over shadow the horror with flying limbs and splashing blood like they could of. It focuses instead on the emotional and psychological turmoil of the main characters and those within the hotel. This is one of the best films I've ever seen. Don Cheadle is superb as Paul Rusesabagina and this important story is something that you'll remember and want to talk about. Reviewed by M. E. Wood.</p></body></html>

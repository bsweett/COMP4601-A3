<meta name="summary" content="Shapeshifting Daniel Day-Lewis"></head><body><p>Actors can be divided up into two categories: Of coarse there are good actors. More interestingly, there are actors that are generally considered to be good, maybe really are good, and then the category in which Daniel Day-Lewis belongs.<br /><br />Indeed there is many a fine actor that has worked in the movies and are famous and loved for their great performances. Often these actors are always quite recognizable in whatever role, however different from the last, that we find them in. No doubt you can come up with your own very long list of these performers! I don't know that there is anything all that wrong with that. There is this much smaller group of performers out there that achieve what is actually the ultimate goal of their particular craft. These performers disappear into the role and what you see on the screen is only the character. Your attention goes to the character and to such an extent that you find yourself amazed that this is the same actor that you'd seen in previous roles.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis actually reminds me of the great director Stanley Kubrick. They are masters of their art. You could at times not help but wish they'd give us more in terms of their output because they're just so damn good -- and by *good* I mean about as perfect as a person can be in doing what they do. You realize though, that your maybe getting a little greedy because when they worked they put *everything* they had into it. Kubrick is gone and we have to live with the fact that we'll not get anymore more Kubrick films. But in all probability we will see -albeit barely recognizably, Daniel Day-Lewis practicing his craft, taking the form of another  character.<br /><br />Watch MY LEFT FOOT, THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS, GANGS OF NEW YORK, THERE WILL BE BLOOD and tell me there is a better actor in the world now.</p></body></html>

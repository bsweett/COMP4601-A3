I was impressed by this film's depiction of the brutality of postwar Spain, a topic that this Mexican filmmaker seems more comfortable exploring than most Spaniards are. My only complaint is that the film focused on too much harsh realism and hardly enough fantasy. A more even mix of the two would have made the film's narrative and themes seem more balanced, especially considering how extraordinary the fantasy visuals were.</p></body></html>

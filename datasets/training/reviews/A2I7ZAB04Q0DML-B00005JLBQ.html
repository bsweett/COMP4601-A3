<meta name="summary" content="&quot;Perdition&quot; Is A Road Worth Taking"></head><body><p>When you bring together such talent as Paul Newman, Tom Hanks and Jude Law, it is almost expected that the movie will be a masterpiece.  Tom Hanks alone, whose body of work includes such incredible performances as Philidelphia, Forrest Gump and Castaway, is an exceptional talent whose abilities are unmatched in Hollywood today.  He possesses the rare gift of truly suspending disbelief by completely immersing himself in the role he plays.<p>In this film, Hanks plays Michael Sullivan, a hit-man working under the thumb of John Rooney (Paul Newman), a powerful crime-lord operating in a rural Illinois town during the early 1930's.  When Sullivan and Conner Rooney (Daniel Craig) are sent on a &quot;hit&quot;, Sullivan's son Michael (Tyler Hoechlin) tags along, concealed in the rear of his father's car.  When he witnesses a murder, he is discovered by Connor and his father, and is sworn to secrecy.<p>John Rooney is enraged at Conner, whose actions went against his father's intent, and he publicly humiliates him while embracing Sullivan as the son he never had, and so Conner exacts revenge out of jealousy, taking out a hit on Sullivan and his family, again acting against his father.<p>Conner succeeds in killing Sullivan's wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and youngest son, but misses both Sullivan and Michael junior.  Upon the discovery of his wife and son's murder, Sullivan vows vengance for their deaths and sets out to find Connor and John Rooney, who have now gone into hiding under the protection of a powerful crime lord in Chicago.  When Rooney learns of Sullivan's intent, he unwillingly contracts a hit-man (Jude Law) to eliminate Sullivan.<p>From this synopsis, one might deduce that this is simply another mob movie, in league with such films as Good Fellas or perhaps even the Godfather.  But what makes this a great film isn't its similarities to the other forementioned classics, but its bold stance to humanize the face of a mobster.  Hank's character is likeable, exhibiting a humanity and a vulnerability not normally portrayed in the hit-man stereotype.  He isn't simply a goon in a fedora and black trench, but a father and husband, whose resolve is shattered when he loses the people closest to him.  His relationship with his son is a pivotal part of the plot, as he must balance his hunger for revenge with the need to protect his boy.<p>Paul Newman also brings a level of depth to the movie which makes him a complicated and difficult character, someone audiences will both pity and hate, and he is played with a level of intelligence and believability that makes him a delight to watch. <p>The ending is a little disappointing, and, though I won't spoil it, I will say that it left this reviewer a little let down.  As Hollywood directors have become infamous for doing, there is a suprise ending that, though plausable, adds little to the story, save for the fact that it brings closure to the story's precept that the narrator states in the beginning of the film.<p>Still, this film deserves the highest rating that I gave it.  It is a first class collection of performances built on a very engaging storyline of power and corruption in 1930's mob manipulated America.  <p>Scott Kolecki</p></body></html>

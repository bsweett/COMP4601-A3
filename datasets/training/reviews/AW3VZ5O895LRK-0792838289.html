Although only a year apart in real life age, it was completely believable that Langsbury played Harvey's mother in the film.  There is even a malevolent incestuous air about the pair that you can't shake off from the very beginning with Harvey as her helpless, hapless victim.  Harvey returns from the Korean war a decorated hero, much to everyone's surprise, since he's known to be both a mama's boy and a royal pain.  Incredibly, all the men in his unit parrot the same high praise about him and how he is the most wonderful, brave human being they've ever known, despite the fact that they hated him! His mother is married to a U.S. senator who he despises and, worse yet, his mother and this toad have presidential aspirations.  Suddenly, other men from his Korean unit start experiencing hideous nightmares and somehow these dreams relate back to him.  We see them all sitting in a library during the war at a garden club meeting but is that where they really are? Korean military men start popping up in the dreams too instead of the elderly garden club ladies. In 1962, when this film was released, the country was first learning about brain washing that had occurred in the Korean War.  Thus, this film was extremely timely.  It was pulled from distribution for many decades though following President Kennedy's assassination.  The supporting cast, including Frank Sinatra and Carol Lynley, is all quite good.  Harvey was an under appreciated actor in his time and it is good to see that his talent has held up splendidly throughout the ensuing years. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

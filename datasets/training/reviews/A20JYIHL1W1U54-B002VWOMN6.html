Murray Abraham as composer Antonio Salieri is enamored by Mozart. Salieri recognizes his genius yet simultaneously loathes Mozart's irreverence for his gift. Both lead destructive lives. One is shattered by jealousy while the other is destroyed by uncontrollable self indulgence. This is innovative film making both engrossing and at times almost irreverent in its approach. But that is what makes it stand out from more conventional filmmaking.</p></body></html>

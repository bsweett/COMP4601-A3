A boring hum-drum movie that has nothing to present about sincere relationships other than its pretentious message.<br /><br />The story follows the lives of four characters who by chance meet and converge into a love square (a love triangle having only 3 people.) Set in London, Dan (Jude Law) is a writer who meets an American stripper named Alice (Natalie Portman) and falls in lust with her only to later meet Anna (Julia Roberts) who is a photographer who is with Larry (Clive Owen), a dermatologist.  The movie follows the ups and downs of each couple's relationship and their cross over to the other over the course of several years.  The audience has to sit and bear how the characters rationalize their dishonesty and vanity as necessary evils to finding true love.  I think it has been proven time and again that strong relationships between couples are based on sincerity, loyalty, and sacrifice as opposed to deceit, manipulation, and lust.  In any case, how could the men in the film have any expectation of such virtues from a stripper which is nothing more than a prostitute in denial?  Trying to present such shallow and selfish people in a positive light is nothing short of tasteless and stupid.<br /><br />This is an absolutely boring film in which its only revelation is its pretentiousness as to the true qualities that make a relationship last between two people.  The overplayed 'Can't Take My Eyes Off You' theme song was as absurd as it was annoying.  Each of the characters are pathetic and despicable examples of shallowness, selfishness, and dishonesty that defy the very notion of people capable of a loving relationship.  Such people are too much in love with themselves to love anyone else.  In short, this film is tasteless, meaningless, and a complete waste of time to watch: soap opera characters have more tact and scruples than the snobbish garbage portrayed in this film.</p></body></html>

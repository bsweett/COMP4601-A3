<meta name="summary" content="An epic World War II masterpiece"></head><body><p>After more than forty years, this movie remains one of the great war movies of all time.  It proves that you don't need an enormous budget, a teen idol, and stuff blowing up all over the place to make a World War 2 masterpiece.  The movie centers around a bridge being build by Allied POWs over the Kwai river (hence the title).  Colonel Saito is the man in charge of the bridge, and the British Colonel Nicholson (played by Alec Guinness) is commander of the British POW troops.  An American, Shears (William Holden), escapes from the camp, and later guides a crack British demolitions team back to the site of the bridge so they can blow it up.<p>A large part of the movie centers around the power struggle between Saito and Nicholson.  The latter refuses to be treated harshly, and insists that his British forces will not cooperate in building the bridge unless he and the other officers can lead the project and do not have to do manual labor.  Saito is a hardheaded despot, who cares nothing for Geneva convention rules but is forced to compromise if he wants his bridge finished on time.  Throughout the movie, these two butt heads until they finally reach an understanding, and from that point on they work together very admirably and build a fine bridge.<p>The problem with having built such a spectacular bridge, however (in which Nicholson rightly takes great pride), is that the allies want to blow it up.  At the end of the film, Nicholson is forced to make a choice between his pet project and his loyalty to his country.  The result is a suspensful finale worthy of this great epic production.<p>The scenery is beautiful, the cinematography grand, the performances exceptionally great.  No wonder this film won 7 Oscars.  This is rightly considered one of the best movies ever made.</p></body></html>

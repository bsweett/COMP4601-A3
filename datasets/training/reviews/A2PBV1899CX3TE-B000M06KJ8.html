This, Madame, is Versailles."></head><body><p>When your father directed The Godfather and Apocalypse Now, and is an executive producer of your film, and you've just won an Oscar for your last film, Lost in Translation (2003), I guess that gives you carte blanche to film a costume drama about Marie-Antoinette on location in Versailles. At least until they boo it at Cannes. It is after midnight and your coach has turned into a pumpkin. Good luck getting your next project green-lighted.<br /><br />--------------<br />Marie-Antoinette: It's not too much, is it?<br />L&eacute;onard: Oh, no!<br />==========<br /><br />For me a telling moment was in the bonus footage where they showed Sofia's daddy saying his daughter came to him for advice and he said something like "Just think of it like you're throwing a Marie-Antoinette party." The film was very much like a Marie-Antoinette party, but what a hangover the next morning, cleaning up the mess.<br /><br />--------------<br />Marie-Antoinette: Letting everyone down would be my greatest unhappiness.<br />==========<br /><br />I liked some things in Marie Antoinette a lot, so let me mention some of them: I liked the cast and the location. I liked the costumes and the art direction. Sofia Coppola had Spanish footwear designer Manolo Blahnik create hundreds of specially made shoes for the film; and Ladur&eacute;e was chosen to make all of the brightly colored pastries and cakes. It was a period drama with great attention to detail, yet with a contemporary twist--a pair of blue Converse tennis shoes was deliberately left in one scene to make the connection that Marie-Antoinette was like a typical teenager. The soundtrack featured post punk 80's music like Bow Wow Wow's cover of Bo Diddley's "I Want Candy" The Cure's "Plainsong" and Adam Ant, who by the way, modeled a lot of his stage costumes on the Louis the XIV look. Sofia returned the favor when she based the look of Count Axel von Fersen (Jamie Dornan), one of Marie-Antoinette's lovers, on Adam Ant.<br /><br />A Marie-Antoinette with punk rock black lipstick says the famous quote attributed to her "Let them eat cake!" but then, the "real" Marie-Antoinette, sans the black lipstick, denies that she would ever say something so callous. Indeed, the not-so-hidden agenda of Marie Antoinette, the film by Sofia Coppola, was to show the human side to the doomed monarch.<br /><br />This is where I stopped liking the film. Not that I object to the idea of making Marie-Antoinette sympathetic per se, I just think that the film did not accomplish this feat. Perhaps she also wanted to show that in spite of all the lavish parties, life at Versailles could be pretty boring. At two hours plus (that seemed like much, much more), she accomplished that. I fell asleep trying to watch it three nights in a row. And after using up all that time, she didn't really manage to tell what was going on. There was one cryptic scene where a portrait of Marie-Antoinette and her family was moved into a sparsely furnished hallway. Then moved again. What was the point? Was someone painted over or added? What? The birth of her first child, a daughter, was shown, but later, as she is forced to leave Versailles by an angry mob, she has more children. With all the emphasis on her producing an heir it seems like Sofia could have mentioned something about their births. As a story teller she went off on so many tangents, burning up over two hours of time, but neglected the basic plot.<br /><br />--------------<br />Marie-Antoinette: So, I hear you like to make keys as a hobby?<br />Louis XVI: Yes.<br />Marie-Antoinette: And do you enjoy making keys?<br />Louis XVI: Obviously.<br />==========<br /><br />Jason Schwartzman as Louis XVI did his job--being the most boring person to ever sit on the throne of France. Judy Davis, Rip Torn, Asia Argento, Molly Shannon, Shirley Henderson, Danny Huston, and Steve Coogan are all very talented, but their talents were largely wasted here. Even Kirsten Dunst (who acts very well here BTW) was better utilized in Bring It On, where she managed to make the head of the cheerleading squad at a privileged school who had stolen all of their winning routines from a school in Compton sympathetic. Marie-Antoinette? Not so much. I tend to agree with the mobs, and Robespierre, and the Red Queen: "Off with her head!"<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001OFFRQ2">How to Lose Friends and Alienate People</a> (2008) Kirsten Dunst was Alison Olsen; and Danny Huston was Lawrence Maddox<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMJG">Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind (Widescreen Edition)</a> (2004) Kirsten Dunst was Mary<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXMP">Bring It On (Widescreen Collector's Edition)</a> (2000) Kirsten Dunst was Torrance Shipman<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXH1">The Virgin Suicides</a> (1999) Directed by Sofia Coppola; and Kirsten Dunst was Lux Lisbon<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305428239">Rushmore</a> (1998) Jason Schwartzman was Max Fischer<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6303369162">New Age [VHS</a>] (1994) Judy Davis was Katherine Witner<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008G8U8">The Man Who Fell to Earth</a> (1976) Rip Torn was Nathan Bryce<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6303066879">Return to Two Moon Junction [VHS</a>] (1995) Molly Shannon was Traci<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000077VQY">Scarlet Diva</a> (2000) Asia Argento was Anna Battista<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007BK2N">24 Hour Party People</a> (2002) Steve Coogan was Tony Wilson; and Shirley Henderson was Lindsay<br /><br />--------------<br />Marie-Antoinette: This is ridiculous.<br />Comtesse de Noailles: This, Madame, is Versailles.<br />==========</p></body></html>

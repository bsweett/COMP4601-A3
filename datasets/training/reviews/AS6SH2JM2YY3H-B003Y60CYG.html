<meta name="summary" content="Star-packed evening of A Prairie Home Companion live radio broadcast... with a twist"></head><body><p>If you've ever listened to a radio show of A Prairie Home Companion, this will be a treat.  You'll see a fictionalized setup of all the hustle and bustle that goes into one of these productions:  the props, notes, the band, make-up (and make-out) rooms, and more.<br /><br />If you've never listened to A Prairie Home Companion, you may be left scratching your head, wondering why anyone would think a recording of a radio broadcast could be movie-worthy.<br /><br />Garrison Keillor's voice and persona weaves this show together, but the surprisingly strong acting and singing performances of Meryl Streep, Woody Harrelson, Lindsay Lohan, and John Reilly really make this more than simply a taping of a show.<br /><br />The plot is "the last show" for A Prairie Home Companion.  How will people act?  What will they say and sing?  The non-Companion listeners who are viewing may say, "who cares?"<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for "risqu&eacute; humor."  Make this a PG rating at most.  This is a movie for the NPR crowd... you know who you are!</p></body></html>

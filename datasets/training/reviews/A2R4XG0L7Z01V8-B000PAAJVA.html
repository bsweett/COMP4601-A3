<meta name="summary" content="In rememberance of Heath Ledger"></head><body><p>I've had The Patriot (not the Steven Segal movie) for absolutely ages. I admit, it was cheap, and I do have phases where I have a bit of a thing of Mel Gibson. But I have to be in the right mood for him.<br /><br />I don't know much about American History. I don't know much about my own Scottish history actually, never mind anything else. But I liked Braveheart, so I figured this was cheap, sounded kinda similar, why the hell not? I'd bought it a few months before Heath Ledger died, and only managed to get round to watching this a couple of months later.<br /><br />Basically, this is one of those movies where everyone who knows their American history will quibble the slightest inaccuracy - and this kinda film is normally riddled with them. But I'm going to skip over all that. I left school for a reason.<br /><br />The Patriot, is about a man with seven children and no wife/mother. No, you're not getting another Von Trapp family. (SEVEN CHILDREN???) The script originally called for six children, but since Mel has seven in real life, it was changed. (SEVEN CHILDREN???) He has particpated previously in battles, and is now a proud family man, trying to keep his children out of danger. But his eldest son, played by a blonde Heath, is determined to serve his country, and goes out fighting.<br /><br />Meanwhile things get hectic back home, with an evil Colonel (Jason Isaacs) hellbent on wrecking quiet family life, until he encounters the Ghost. Can you guess who it is?<br /><br />There's not much else to report on The Patriot, without repeating 800+ reviewers have already said. It's there to be watched, but at 2hrs 48mins long, you need to find a long night free, with no interruptions. (Easter Sunday strangely enough did it for me.) Mel doesn't really get stretched playing the role of Benjamin Martin, and there are a couple of similarities, particularly in scenes, to Braveheart. (Did you see the scene where he was riding in front of the army? Did you not want to shout at the TV "FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEDOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM"? Or was that just me?)<br /><br />It was one of those films that yes was good, but could have been edited slightly better towards the end. The rest of the running time passed by like a breeze, but you do tend to find the last 30-45 minutes do start to drag. Otherwise, not really an appropriate movie to watch on Easter Sunday, but hey, I had to watch it sometime!</p></body></html>

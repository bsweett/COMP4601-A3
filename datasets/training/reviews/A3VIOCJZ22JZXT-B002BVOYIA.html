<meta name="summary" content="Important and excellent film"></head><body><p>The film, Hotel Rwanda, is similar to Schindler's List and The Diary of Ann Frank, in that it is more than entertainment; it documents a national act of genocide of one people against another. Therfore the film has to be reviewed both as an artistic statement and as a political statement. I will cover both in this review.<br /><br />First, this is suberb film making with an incredible cast of actors. However Don Cheadle demonstrated that his acting skills are of the highest order. The film did an excellent job of balancing the tensions and drama within the hotel with the terror in the streets. Major societal tensions are mirrored in the hotel staff, some of which are Tutsis and some of which are Hutus. The film did an excellent job of demonstrating the terror as parents tired to keep thier children from being murdered against a mob of Hutus, intent on killing all Tutsis in the country. Thus the film demonstrated at the individual, the family, the neighborhood, the ethnic, and the national levels the terror of this genocide.<br /><br />Second,the film is a political statement against genocide and the politics around genocide. Long brewing social injustice,a breakdown of the social contract, opportunistic political leaders, prejudice and stereotypes, and a highly visible or high profile catalyst to mob violence are the formula for genocide which this film displayed very well. The film is subtle in demonstrating that many of the Tutsis were of a higher economic class than the Hutus and this was due to the Belgium preference for the lighter skinned, thinner, taller Tutsis as compared to the shorter, darker, thicker Hutus. This long brewing social injustice set the stage for opportunistic politicians to gain control of the country with ethinic warfare as their vehicle. The assassination of the President by his own military, blamed on the Tutsis rebels, and fanned into flame by violence monger radio personalities served as the catalyst that sparked the terror.<br /><br />There has been much discussion around the lack of a response from Europe and the United States during this catastrope. The explanations include the recent US military crisis in Mogadishu (see Black Hawk Down for a great film on this incident), the lack of understanding of the politics and tensions in the region, the involvement of the UN in Bosnia and Serbia, and racism against darker races.  All of these forces, no doubt, played a role. However we have to ask both our politicians and the media to do a much better job of educating the public around these issues. The media was slow to report this genocide and thus delayed international action. We should never let this happen again.<br /><br />Buy this film, it is outstanding. Keep it in your collection since it is part of human history.</p></body></html>

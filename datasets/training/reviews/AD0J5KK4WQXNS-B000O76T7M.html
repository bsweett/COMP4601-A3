<meta name="summary" content="Absolutely NOT what we always wanted."></head><body><p>Anderson knows exactly how to disappoint and often do the opposite of what his career suggested with "Event Horizon" with AvP going back to the fanboy basics of rewriting "Mortal Kombat the movie" and introducing Aliens and Predators as allegedly the principle players... for a on-screen running time of about eight minutes when they eventually manage to come together - "Where is the AvP in AvP?" ends up being question #2 next to question #1 - "why is this PG13?" Anderson usually says that it is the studio's fault (note - "usually says", as this is not the first time he has used the excuse; see - Soldier, Resident Evil 1 + 2 plus his Director's Comments on this DVD!) but if you look at Anderson's track record you can tell that the producers have known what their product was all along - *Aliens for Children*.<br /><br />If they are going to slaughter a series at least choose one at a time. Here they manage hack both to death in one go. Is it economic for Hollywood to fail two franchises in the budget or something? Alien and Predator are high concept artistic science-fiction creations as a result of human qualities (fear, speed, technology strength etc). AvP is not `art' in any sense of the word. In fact while Alien and Alien 2, even Predator 1 and Predator 2 to some degree can lay claim to being "art" movies with AvP even having a worthy art series of graphic novels (please do not call them comics) all these appear to have been left sidelined for what is a fanboy Alien meets Predator... with the emphasis on the word `boy' ... and another on the fact that we know humour does not work here since Alien: Resurrection, the scene is set for an auditorium full of 12 year old going "Hahahahaha", "yuccchk" or "cool look at the way that guy died" or "Yeah the Alien won that battle", you don't care about any of the wooden-as-your-front-door cannon fodder characters that you saw in Braveheart as extras, or the fact that the set from Mortal Kombat 1 and 2 has been reconstructed, or the fact that the person sitting next to you in the auditorium is half your height as you mull over the changing times of having witnessed ALIEN in the cinema, you would at least expect a little more Alien Vs Predator and not an artic mission that takes up half the movie.<br /><br />I will say this much - AvP is certainly the WORST Predator movie (how could it be any worse than this!), but maybe there is a chance that Alien: Resurrection can sit next to this one in the same sort of "turkey entry" vanity casting, there is plenty of reasons not to see AvP, but considering that this is the only sci-fi movie with a 2004/2005 Hollywood budget, you might be glad to know that it does do some interesting science fiction from time to time, so sci-fi lovers may sit through this as they did something like Riddick, knowing that both these films are not a patch on the original, the interesting few moments in AvP are the CGI generated blackflash historical fights between the two aliens; a nice earth-entry landing and the concept of Predators harvesting Aliens, maybe one fight sequence, but in the end little segments that you thought where good do not make a movie by any means. Trying to find another excuse for watching AvP, there is about thirty minutes of Lance Henriksen fanboy backside pucking-up, but then again that is about the best thing this movie has to offer, and Lance knows that with Ripley gone, Schwarzenneger a Governor and Glover chasing serial killers called SAW, he can bend over for as long as he likes... and he does! ... so watch it for him maybe... but little else. And hey yeah it does have a 3rd act Mother Alien Vs Predator ending with overtones of water as deep-space, but the double-dose-to-be-continued-endings really does raise questions about how much attention anyone paid in biology class aside for imagining what green guts look like on the floor --- brains firmly out the window and double to be continued in two directions maybe, this is like some of sort of sales pitch for the entire movie or what? I wish Cameroon and Scott could have done something before the completely artless fanboy bubblegum directors somehow get their hands on the concept.</p></body></html>

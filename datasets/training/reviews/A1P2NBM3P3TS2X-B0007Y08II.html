<meta name="summary" content="FUNNIEST action film parody with puppets of mid-2004!"></head><body><p>Absofrickinlutely hilarious!<br /><br />The sex scene was the biggest laugh in the film, and the songs are better than the bombastic movie songs they parody.<br /><br />"You can show it in a MONTAGE!!"<br /><br />When I saw it in the theater on a Friday night, there were only 10 of us there.  That meant that there were only 10 people in town that night with a smart enough sense of humor to "get it".<br /><br />If this DVD has ANY extra footage, commentaries, or whatever, it will make the DVD a STEAL!  Because the movie "as is" is MORE than enough reason to buy this DVD.<br /><br />If you are tired of (and disappointed by) the hokiness and silliness of Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer/the-crapmeisters-who-gave-us-"Independence-Day"-and-"Godzilla" movies, then TA:WP is the thumb-nosing you wish you could deliver to Hollywood personally.<br /><br />I'm so excited about this DVD getting released that I'm tempted to hibernate until the release date so I don't have to be so giddily anxious for the remaining weeks until then.<br /><br />****(and to reviewer Shuckert who reviewed this film on 03/17/05 and included a note about my review: --  I know Bay and Bruckheimer weren't involved with "ID4" and "Godzilla"  - the punctuation was supposed to mean Bay AND Bruckheimer AND the creators of "ID4" and "Godzilla", and not imply that they were all on the same team.  Sorry if I failed to be clear on that with the "/" mark.)****</p></body></html>

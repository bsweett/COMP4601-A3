<meta name="summary" content="AMX"></head><body><p>American History X is one of the most powerful and gripping dramas ever made. The story shows the tragedy of hate and ignorance on both sides of the black/white racial boundary. Narrated posthumously by Daniel Vinyard, the story shows us the hate of white supremicist Derrick Vinyard and how his hate rips not only his world, but his family apart as well. The movie does an excellent job of driving home the old adage that "what goes around, comes around." With an amazing cast, and powerful story line, it's all but impossible to walk away from this movie unmoved and with eyes unopened</p></body></html>

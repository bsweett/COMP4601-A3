<meta name="summary" content="Intelligent Gangster Movie"></head><body><p>This is an intelligent cross between mobster and typical gangster movies. Unlike many where the people are too drunk, stoned or incompetent, this is much more realistic. The actors do a bang-up job of playing their parts. The cinematography and editing are great. The sound is great, especially the soundtrack. You get to see snippets into the future, so you have some idea of what might happen, but the suspense makes you watch all of it unfold. Probably in the top 50 of my 2000+ films, perhaps in top 25. Watch those colors, boys!</p></body></html>

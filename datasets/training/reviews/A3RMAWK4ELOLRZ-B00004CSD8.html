Her husband Robert (Liev Schreiber) knows this, and without consulting her first, switches the stillborn with another baby.  They name the child Damien (as in demon).  At Damien's (4th) birthday [party], their nanny commits suicide by hanging herself by the house, saying aloud it's "all for you [Damien]"  After that incident, another woman is `hired' to be the new nanny.  I didn't like this nanny, and I think she was really the bad one, instead of Damien.  Anyways, one day all three of them (mom, dad, and Damien) are on their way to church.  Approaching the church, Damien gets nervous and feverish.  When they arrive at the church, Damien throws a big fit.  Okay, if I was there, I'd think something was really messed up with my child, and I would have him checked out by a doctor as soon as possible!!  Another incident is when Katherine takes Damien and a bunch of other kids to the zoo.  Damien goes to see the monkeys by himself, while the other kids go in separate directions.  The monkeys notice Damien and are afraid.  The big gorilla suddenly tries to break through the glass (I guess to try and kill Damien).  After that unpleasant incident, Katherine thinks there is something really wrong with her son.  She sees a therapist for this.  When Katherine falls from the top floor of her house, she winds up in the hospital.  She isn't dead, but she's badly injured.  When she `mysteriously' dies one day, and Robert finds out, he takes immediate action.  It's up to him now to kill his son, otherwise who knows who else will die.<br /><br />This is an exact replica of the original!  I don't remember, though, that ugly-faced guy Robert was questioning, to be in the original.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="More a welcome than a triumph"></head><body><p>A lot of horror films lately have fell into 2 categories: the so-called "gorno" type films where the film contains some of the more vile and disgusting imagery this side of Cannibal Holocaust while the other believes by putting in a whole bunch of scenes that make audiences jump and preferably has a creepy kid. The faults are of course gore disgusts, doesn't scare and having a bunch of scenes that make people jump out of their seat doesn't stay with you long enough to get under your skin. "The Mist", directed by Frank Darabont, at least approaches a horror movie by filling the film with tension and unease; it's just too bad it makes some faults with other things as well.<br /><br />Artist David Drayden is heading to the store to pick up some supplies after a particularly violent storm and a strange mist coming from the mountains. Just thinking it's routine, it turns even more strange when the mist rolls into town, blanketing everything and one citizen screams of things within it. While some are skeptical, others see proof that they are essentially trapped by the things that lurk on the outside as well as threatened by those that are in the inside, but not monsters necessarily but people.<br /><br />One of the hardest things to accomplish in a film, especially in the horror genre, is to have characters people watching will care about so that when they go, a feeling of sadness comes. The Mist strives for this in scenes where we get to know some of them but a lot of them are written so one-dimensionally or lacking that it's hard to feel anything for them since there's just not a lot for them to do. Then there's some dumb decisions and illogical choices that it's hard to take what they do and feel something from it. One character I thought worked well, which was Toby Jones as grocery store bagger Ollie while the one that got the most attention (though I didn't care for her) was Mrs. Carmody played by Marcia Gay Hayden who portrays her with such frequent Bible-talk that you feel if any comeuppance should come to her, it's simply because she's annoying and not what she's saying or represents.<br /><br />As a horror film, does it succeed? Well it does to a certain extent since there is some scenes of attacks and bug-related goodness and the servicable-but-not-stellar effect work gets you going but the emphasis on the human characters unhinged and without authority restraints doesn't give it as much creepiness but then there's some scenes like a pharmacy visit that work exceedingly well. As far as the ending is concerned, it's one where emotionally it might watch the feel of the film but doesn't really connect for some reason, either the overbearing music or acting but some feel it's the right kind of ending for this film or it's either too depressing and the ending worked or you didn't like it because of what it did.<br /><br />In many ways the Mist reminds me of a music band that is very musically accomplished but has a terrible singer. You could have things that work well (the direction, tone) but there's always that nagging thing that you can either forgive and keep listening or can't get past that one thing that brings it down.</p></body></html>

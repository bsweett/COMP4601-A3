I'm with the genius crowd.  Brothers Grimm is probably the most unfairly panned movie I've seen in a long while.  Gilliam's style is baroque, and by a director who knows the definition.  Visually, this can be quite stunning, as various nasty and beautiful things poke out of corners of a scene.  Sort of like a Durer woodcut as imagined by Hieronymus Bosch. And the Brothers Grimm is perfect ground for Gilliam's magic - a dark fairytale that is also has a clash of ideas.  It's 1812, the Age of Napoleon, not a good time for the Imagination.  Nevertheless, con-men Jake & Will Grimm are cashing in off of superstition and fear, since it's also an Age of Anxiety, and people believe more than ever in things that go bump in the night.  The bumbling Grimms are played, quite effectively by Matt Damon (who pulls off the accent nicely) and Heath Ledger (a head scratching, eye-squinting success).  Their evil counterparts, End Products from the Age of Reason, are a French general, played by Jonathan Pryce, and his wacky henchman, played by the always wonderful Peter Stormare.  Little girls are disappearing in a small town, and something needs to be done about it.  And the Grimms are caught in the middle.  You will recognize bits and pieces of various fairy tales, as the Grimms stumble and bumble along to try and figure out the mystery.  To reveal more would be cheating you out of a great tale and some genuine surprises.  Check it out!</p></body></html>

They beat up other gangs, and in an especially vile moment, they beat an elderly man and rape his wife. To make a long story short, Alex has a falling out with his friends, and Alex is arrested.<br /><br />This is when things start to get interesting. Certainly, Alex's actions were not to be admired. But gradually, we see that the people around him, and even the ones in the system are not so likable or admirable either. (A counselor is a pervert; the prison workers seem more interested in vengeance than justice; one prison worker seems to be a spin off of Adolf Hitler; the list goes on and on.)<br /><br />Alex hears about a method designed for getting people out of prison early, and making sure they never go back. (It basically makes the patient incapable of making the choice to act on sexual or violent impulses.)  The prison Chaplain seems to be the only voice of reason when he says: "When a man can not choose, he ceases to be a man." But Alex gets his way.<br /><br />All seems well, and Alex gets released from prison early. But things are not so well on the outside. His parents rented his room out, and there is really nowhere for Alex to go. From this moment on, the director does NOT allow our newly won sympathy for Alex to slack for a moment. It does in fact intensify. Alex's former victims see him and take their opportunity for revenge, and because of the treatment, Alex can't protect himself. To make matters worse, Alex runs into his former friends who have now become cops. (And should we be surprised? This does seem to keep with the movie's intentions.) But the worst is yet to come.<br /><br />It is interesting how the government appears to want to help Alex towards the end, but with just a bit of thought, we can see that helping Alex only seems to go along with their hopes of getting reelected. McDowell does in fact 'get cured.' But how different is the end of the movie from the start now? If anything, McDowell has more material to blackmail the government with now.<br /><br />Not only is this movie a masterpiece on social awareness, but the soundtrack is great too. I highly suggest it.</p></body></html>

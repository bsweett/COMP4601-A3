<meta name="summary" content="Excellent thriller from "Moon's" Duncan Jones"></head><body><p>Director Duncan Jones gets a little more money to work with after the success of "Moon" a couple years ago.  In this modern day sci-fi thriller, Jake Gyllenhaal plays a helicopter pilot shot down in Afghanistan; but he seems in a confusing state of mind.  In reality, scientific/medical technology has tapped into what is left of his brain (not much body left).  He is being used to travel back in time for 8 minute stretches.  He appears on a commuter train in Chicago just before a bomb goes off and kills everyone on board.  His mission is to stop it.  It takes him several attempts in consecutive 8 minute time frames.  Generally I'm not much for this "Groundhog Day" style of filmmaking but here Jones manages to change the environment enough that the story remains interesting.  Mid-movie the film becomes a traditional thriller as Colter (Jake G.) gets ever closer to the terrorist.  The ending is a bit of a cop-out, directed at mainstream filmgoers.  Some will hate it.  Overall, this is certainly satisfying entertainment in a spring full of popcorn worthy films.</p></body></html>

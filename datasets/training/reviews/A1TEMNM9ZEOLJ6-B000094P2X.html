It's nowhere near as scary as the original, but it does have some tension sufficient to hold your interest. Ed Norton, somewhat light in his loafers, plays Jodi Foster in this, while Hannibal Lechter is, as usual, Anthony Hopkins. The main villain is no Hannibal Lechter, but he has his moments. You've seen the ending several times before. Trust me. Watch if you are a Lambs fan. Just don't expect any great miracles.</p></body></html>

I still remember buying Resident Evil 2 when I was a teenager and taking it home and playing it for the first time. It just sucked me in instantly and before you know it I was out looking for the first one. This movie is no different. It sucks you in from the very beginning and doesnt let up till the end. It is a fantastic action/horror/sci-fi movie that is filled with great special effects. If you are a zombie or video game lover this film is for you.</p></body></html>

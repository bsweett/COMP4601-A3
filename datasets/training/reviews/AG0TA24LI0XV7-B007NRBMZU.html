<meta name="summary" content="A completely Nasty film experience"></head><body><p>As I watch this film I just keep saying, "Oh, man, what horribly disturbing thing is going to happen next??"<br />If this thought thrills you, then give this flick five stars, by all means.<br /><br />I really don't know what to make of The Butterfly Effect except that its few interesting concepts (and they are very few) are completely drowned out by a deeply disturbing and manipulative series of events which are supposed to be a story.<br /><br />This is a nasty film. I don't say things like that often, and I don't use words lightly.<br /><br />This movie just smacks you in the face time after time with insulting nonsense. Throughout the entire film I feel extremely uncomfortable. And not in the good way that you enjoy from a film. Maybe that's what they were looking to do when they made this thing, make people uncomfortable. No, thanks. If someone finds this stuff fun or enjoyable, then there is a problem with the person emotionally or psychologically.<br /><br />Child pornography, drug abuse, cruelty to animals, and unspeakable graphic violence from kids are all things that lurk in our deepest nightmares (or on the six o'clock news broadcasts). But here they are, presented for your approval as entertainment. Not my idea of a good night at the movies.<br /><br />I would feel differently if this film really raised some worthwhile issues, or had a truly riveting story to tell, or contained fascinating and richly drawn characters, or painted an emotionally satisfying picture. It does none of these things.<br /><br />Each fantastic and twisted scenario presented gets worse and worse. This is really just an exercise in sensational shock value. 'How can we freak the audience out for a couple of hours', this film seems to ask. And even when the film seems to be going in a positive direction it is all too brief and too late for all the negative crap it has already spewed at its audience.<br /><br />People who love this film should reexamine why they do. It may be just for cheap and easy thrills. This movie flirts with science fiction and aims to be high psychological drama. It fails, big time. People say "Wow, this film really blew my mind". Fine. Yes, it's all very freaky and disturbing stuff. But does that equal a good film? No. There are other psychological films that succeed way beyond this junk, movies that are thought provoking, entertaining, and fascinating, that don't pander to the lowest or go for cheap jolts. I would advise people to avoid this movie unless they enjoy staring at awful car wrecks for long periods of time.<br /><br />The worst part for me is that this could have been a really fascinating and interesting film (rather than a stupid shock ride), because it plays with such intriguing concepts and ideas: time travel and altering the past to change the future. Handled differently, The Butterfly Effect could've been a good film instead of a huge, ugly disappointment.</p></body></html>

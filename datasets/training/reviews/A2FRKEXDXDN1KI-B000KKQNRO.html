<meta name="summary" content="Blu-ray: The 2-Disc Extended Cut definitely makes a difference!  This Blu-ray disc is jam packed with special features!"></head><body><p>When Dan Brown's novel "THE DA VINCI CODE" was released back in 2003, the novel received plenty of criticism and scrutiny.  As the book would focus on "The Holy Grail" and the theory that Jesus Christ was married to Mary Magdalene and the Catholic Church has done all it can to cover that up.  Then upon the release of the film version based on the novel in 2006, the Roman Catholic Church and Catholics boycotted the film.<br /><br />If anything, the hype from the film earned the film $232.1 million worldwide during its opening, making it the seventh biggest opening for a film in history and also the second highest grossing movie in 2006 worldwide with over $758 million in profit making it the most financially successful film for both actor Tom Hanks and Director Ron Howard.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"THE DA VINCI CODE" on Blu-ray ala 1080p High Definition features a beautiful location shots in France and England and to shoot a film at the actual Museum de Louvre was surprising and very cool (and to learn how everything was recreated to scale and describe further in the special features).  There are really beautiful shots of the various locations throughout Europe and captured beautifully by Salvatore Totino.  Totino's insistence of using a Long Cooke S4 lens for diffusion filtering gave certain shots a nice, dark and brooding feel at times.  But during the outdoor scenes, the shots are absolutely beautiful.  Totino who made his major Hollywood debut with "Any Given Sunday" and working on films such as "The Missing" and "Cinderella Man" has been Ron Howard's go to man for cinematography.  Overall, well-done!<br /><br />The audio is also quite immersive and dialogue is crystal clear.  Primarily the film focuses on dialogue but once the action scenes start, as does Hans Zimmer's beautiful score.  You get good usage of all channels on your home theater through the Dolby True HD 5.1 soundtrack (English and French).  And its important to note that the film is not an action film but there are a good number of gunshots and chase scenes.  But what shines is Zimmer's Academy Award nominated score which sets the actual mood of the scene.<br /><br />Overall, "The Da Vinci Code: Extended Cut" looks and sounds awesome via High Definition.<br /><br />As for subtitles, English, English SDH and French are included.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />"The Da Vinci Code: Extended Cut" is loaded with special features on two-discs.

But by saying that, it's unfortunate that this extended cut was not shown in the theaters, because those extra scenes of violence featuring Silas and the additional scenes make the film much edgier and understandable.  And the reason for the extended version not being used is probably due to its duration because this extended cut is 174 minutes long (original theatrical version is 149 minutes).<br /><br />And the film was not exactly well received by many critics because they felt Director Ron Howard and screenwriter Akiva Goldsman didn't take any risks, they didn't show any danger as seen in the original book by Dan Brown.With that being said, the extended cut makes a difference...  A big difference.  But whether or not you are open to film's premise is up to the viewer.  If anything, as Dan Brown had said in interviews, he wants the film to create intellectual debates.<br /><br />Multiple Academy Award winner Tom Hanks plays a likable Robert Langdon, a symbiologist who doesn't take things as is and has a mind that is constantly working overtime.  If anything, Langdon is an ordinary man who becomes a fugitive for a murder he doesn't commit.  He is a man that tends to doubt theories of history as stories could have been re-invented due to political and religious times.<br /><br />Audrey Tautou who charmed us in "Amelie" plays a convincing cryptologist Sophie Neveu is a person not religious but feels Langdon is her key to finding out who killed her grandfather.  Both Hanks and Tautou compliment each others performances but for those who expect more from Tom Hanks, may be disappointed that in this film, he is no action star but a Harvard professor that utilizes his skill and experience and nothing more.<br /><br />Jean Reno plays the side of the cop who takes things into his own hands, a role perfect for Reno and Ian McKellen absolutely shines as the obsessive Sir Leigh Teabing.<br /><br />There is no doubt that "THE DA VINCI CODE" would be a controversial film that would challenge the Catholic church.  Anything that challenges an established religion is sure to cause a ruckus and people are defensive about their religion and belief in God.  Especially when it comes to Mary Magdalene's status.  It will be forever debated of her role, if she was simply a devout follower of Jesus Christ or a loving wife that was kept secret and both have an extended line of children with the bloodline that exist today but is kept hidden.  Whatever your beliefs are or if your ability to suspend your beliefs and to see how the film (and its message) presents itself is up to the viewer.<br /><br />But the film seems to be one that one would either love or one would hate.  For me, I was entertained by the film and having watched multiple specials from 20/20 and on The History Channel regarding "THE DA VINCI CODE" and the theories that support and are against the theory is quite interesting.<br /><br />But what I found so inspiring was watching the Blu-ray and getting a feel of how much went into this film.  From recreating the Louvre, the production design coming up with over 125 paintings to recreate the museum to the actual props that had to be created and the many locations that had to be shot and the many sets that had to be created.  I was very impressed.<br /><br />The Blu-ray as I expected looks and sounds incredible and the special features featured on both discs alone are just outstanding.  So, overall, I felt "THE DA VINCI CODE" to be a very solid Blu-ray release.  But it's one of those films that it all comes down to the viewer if such a film can be watched over and over again, or if the film can be appreciated for its controversial storyline.  But as for the release itself, if you are into the filmmaking process or even a student in film, these are the kind of releases that you truly appreciate and enjoy.<br /><br />"THE DA VINCI CODE: EXTENDED CUT" is definitely worth checking out!</p></body></html>

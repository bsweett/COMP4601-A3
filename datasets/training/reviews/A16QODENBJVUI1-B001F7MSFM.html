Spoilers abound!<br /><br />Gradually over the past several years Guillermo del Toro has emerged as arguably the finest creator of fantastical films in the world. Now that he has been tagged to direct the two-part HOBBIT he has the opportunity to cement that reputation. Even without that, however, he has a string of remarkable films behind him. His finest film remains PAN'S LABYRINTH. He has also made both of the HELLBOY films, the stunning Spanish language THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE, the second (and best) part of the BLADE trilogy, and the absolutely terrifying horror film MIMIC. Others can boast two or three such films, but few so many or of such high quality.<br /><br />HELLBOY II was, if anything, even more enjoyable than the first film. del Toro focuses less on plot than on the interrelations between the various characters and the way that affects things. Their superheroic adventures by contrast serve as mere interruptions to that. The central conflict in the film is Liz's unhappiness in her relationship with Hellboy and her hesitation in telling her that she is pregnant. This is the issue they all refocus on when not having to deal with saving the world from destruction by the Golden Army. But it reminds us that whatever else the characters are despite their astonishing gifts, they are persons as well, with the kinds of concerns that people have.<br /><br />One of my favorite characters in the Hellboy films is Abe Sapien, marvelously portrayed by the astonishing Doug Jones. Over the years Jones, a mime by training, has carved out a career as perhaps the best-known physical actor in Hollywood. If you need a character that needs to move in remarkable fashion, Jones is often called upon to bring them to life. For instance, though Laurence Fishburne voiced the Silver Surfer, Jones provided the template for the CGI imaging. Fans of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER will remember him as the taller of the two main Gentlemen in the classic Season Four episode "Hush." But no one has used Jones as effectively as del Toro. He has been not only played Abe Sapien in the Hellboy movies, but several other characters as well. And in PAN'S LABYRINTH Jones portrayed both the Fawn of the title (which is not, by the way, Pan -- that was added only to the English translation of the title -- in most other languages the film is simply THE LABYRINTH OF THE FAWN) as well as the Pale Man who haunts the girl with his eye balls in the palms of his hands. I'm sure del Toro will find a place for him in THE HOBBIT as well. Actually, I'm fairly certain he'll find several places.<br /><br />There were just so many things that I enjoyed about this film. Many of these were small touches, such as the battle Hellboy has beside the Brooklyn Bridge with the Elemental, while holding a small baby. As a viewer knowing what he does not (that Liz is pregnant with his child), one realizes that he might make a better father than one might initially suppose. I also loved the way that while the film utilizes staggering amounts of CGI, it is never used more than is necessary. The CGI is used in service of the story; the film is not merely a vehicle for CGI, which is the case with, say, TRANSFORMERS and SPEED RACER.<br /><br />The summer of 2008 could well be remembered as the summer of the superhero film. It started off with IRON MAN, progressed to THE INCREDIBLE HULK and HELLBOY II, and finally to THE DARK KNIGHT. Well, OK, there was also HANCOCK. But those four good films are easily the best batch of superhero movies ever to be released in a single summer. All signs are that they will receive considerable competition in the future. Barring success by 20th Century Fox's lawsuit attempting to ban its release, THE WATCHMEN is slated for a Spring 2009 release. Marvel now has its own production company and has announced future films based on Thor, the Runaways (my personal favorites in all the Marvel Universe), the Avengers, and Captain America, as well as sequels to Iron Man and The Hulk. DC has lagged behind Marvel in the quality and quantity of its properties coming to light (THE DARK KNIGHT notwithstanding), but I have little doubt that they will start taking steps to correct that. Over the past 20 years the comics that DC has put out, especially under its Vertigo imprint, has been far superior to Marvel. The problem is that those titles are by and large more complex and darker. Marvel may not have anything quite as stunning as Gaiman's Sandman series or Y: THE LAST MAN (which is rumored to be under development as a film project) or Willingham's FABLES or Ellis's TRANSMETROPOLITAN, but as great as these are as comics, they may not have the mass movie appeal of the Marvel titles. Time will tell.</p></body></html>

Undoubtedly one of the most popular movies ever made, this majestic, heartwarming fantasy  is greeted with enthusiasm with each new generation. The public obviously  adores Capra's &quot;human touch&quot; and the performances are all  memorable down to Stewart's kids (Every time a  bell rings, an angel gets  his wings!) Beulah Bondi is typically natural as Ma Bailey, Lionel  Barrymore hatefully crusty Mr. Potter; even the cameo by Sheldon Leonard  stands out. As Mary Bailey, Donna Reed was never more lovely or appealing,  and Gloria Grahame is fun as Violet the tart. The scenes we remember are  many: young George getting smacked on the ear by the pharmacy owner, Mary  and George falling into the pool; the victrola and &quot;moonlight and  rocks&quot; scene. This holiday classic has the distinction of being the  favourite work of both Capra and Stewart!</p></body></html>

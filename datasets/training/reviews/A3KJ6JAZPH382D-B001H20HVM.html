Fortunately, it also meant that the perpetrators of the first movie were given a little more money and time to hone their movie's rough edges. The resulting "Saw II" is a superior movie, and my favorite of the first three.<br /><br />Jigsaw's master plan to teach his victims their life lesson is to trap a group of interconnected people in a booby trap laden house. In the opposite end of town, he is apprehended by an angry, bitter, Donnie ("I'm Not Mark") Whalberg. But then the trick of the Saw movies comes into play. Whalberg's son is in the house of horrors and all the other victims have a connection to the crooked cop that sent them to jail. All Whalberg has to do is just stay where he is, Jigsaw cooly (and superbly played by Tobin Bell) instructs him, and the son will be given back to him. (Along with the movie's catch phrase "Oh yes, there will be blood.")<br /><br />Of course, the house where all the others are trapped is tricked out with multiple killing games and the police at Jigsaw's hideout are reduced to watching as, one by one, they meet their gory demises. This is another point where "Saw II" betters its origin. I found it increasingly hard to care what happened to the to protagonists in the first film, and got to the point where - except for the final twist - I was finding the movie to be almost laughable. In "Saw II," there are so many people in so much trouble that it turns into a game of ten little Indians; who is going to get picked off next, and how? Can Whalberg control his rage at Jigsaw and get his safely returned son as reward? Add to the mix the movie's relentless pacing, and "Saw II" became both a horror/gore fest and a suspense movie.<br /><br />There is also a tight twist at the end to set up "Saw 3" (even if I believe this to be the superior movie), and all sorts of loose ends that can appear in the plans for two more in the franchise. As horror movies go, "Saw II" gets two bloody slashed-off thumbs up.</p></body></html>

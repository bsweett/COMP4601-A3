<meta name="summary" content="Best football movie I've ever seen"></head><body><p>This is probably the best football movie I've ever seen. Based on the nonfiction book, the story follows a Texas High School through their 1988 season as they try to win a state championship. The pressure put on the players by the entire town is unreal. They can't go anywhere without someone asking them if they're going all the way or  someone showing them their ring from when they won state. The night they lose their first game, the coaches yard is littered with 'For Sale' signs. The town is anything but subtle.<br /><br />The movie is well written and acted showing each of the players as a real person and you experience all the pressure their under. Tim McGraw does an excelent job as an overly critical father of a son who can't stop fumbling the ball. The final game has some of the best  football scenes I've ever seen in a movie. I never read the book so I didn't know the outcome of the game and found myself on the edge of my seat rooting for them to pull it out.</p></body></html>

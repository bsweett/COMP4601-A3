How very wrong! Puppets, yes. Kids, definitely not.<br /><br />The basic story follows an actor in his new life as a member of Team America, (the other member was killed in Paris). The Team are on the case of North Korean Kim Jong Il, and his plot to destroy the world, with the assistance of Alec Baldwin and the Film Actors Guild, (FAG).<br /><br />In the process, this film offends just about everyone, while following the violent and ludicrously funny exploits of Team America. This movie takes puppets and comedy to whole new levels in violence and sensuality, (if you can call it that). The laughs just keep coming relentlessly. Kim Jong Il's serenade about being so lonely is funny, and that is about as sensitive as it gets.<br /><br />The rest is in-your-face satire that is not too subtle, (a sledeghammer comes to mind). It is gratuitously violent, which just adds to the mayhem and laughter, and there is a fair amount of vomit as well. Refined culture is not a big thing for this movie as it pokes fun at just about everything and everyone.<br /><br />I have rarely laughed so hard in my life, and my tear ducts were soon dry. It was almost embarrassing choking in public. This movie is a must! It is awesome!<br /><br />Just don't take the kids, ok?</p></body></html>

You can make up your own minds as to whether the mercy killing at the end is moral, but I wouldn't focus too hard on that. Take with you instead that spirit and drive are what makes life worth living, and that winners only do what losers won't. Well worth your time if you aren't too cynical about moviegoing.</p></body></html>

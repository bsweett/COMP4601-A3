<meta name="summary" content="Their acting hasn't improved much since Titanic"></head><body><p>Kate Winselt and Leondaro DiCaprio, that same duo that brought you <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JLWW">Titanic</a>, now star in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KZIRKE">Revolutionary Road [Blu-ray</a>], a very different film. This movie isn't really a lighthearted love story, which is what I expected based upon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000JLWW">Titanic</a>. Rather, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001KZIRKE">Revolutionary Road</a> attempts to show the struggles of a young couple seeking to break out of the traditional mold of 1950s suburbia. The premise of the movie was interesting, but it's a very dark movie and not a great date movie (my date fell asleep). Furthermore, Winselt and DiCaprio just weren't the actors to carry this out. DiCaprio is very stiff and can't get beyond being boyish, despite being 34 years old. Winselt is way too dramatic and overacts. At the end of the movie, I felt little personal connection or sympathy for either character. This movie might appeal to some audiences, but it was entirely forgettable for me.</p></body></html>

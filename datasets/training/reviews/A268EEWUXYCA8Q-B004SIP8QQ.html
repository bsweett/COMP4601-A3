<meta name="summary" content="Review Part 2: Where we learn of Bill"></head><body><p>(continued from the Kill Bill 1 page)...<br /><br />Where Volume 1 was Tarantino's homage to old school martial arts films and Japanese pop and cinema culture, Volume 2 is a western.  On the surface, it's easy to think that these are two very different genres of movies but in theme that's not true.  Both deal with revenge.  How many martial arts movies and westerns have you seen where someone has been killed and must be revenged?<br /><br />The music is another connection to the styles.  In Vol 1, the music is more J-Pop and Japanese style in theme (look at the 5, 6, 7, 8s).  In Vol 2, Robert Rodriguez (director/writer of Desperado, etc) created the music (in fact, he did it for $1 with the intentions that Tarantino would direct a portion of Rodriguez's next movie for $1 which happens to be Sin City.  Make sure to catch that April 1st).  With Rodriguez's flair, the music becomes more western/mexican.<br /><br />The other connection is that a lot of Asian films are like Tarantino's in that they are non-linear (i.e. The Grudge, etc).  Vol 1 was very non-linear in it's story-telling approach.  Vol 2, being more westernized, is told in a more linear way.  Not to say it doesn't move back in time then to the present, because it does.  But, in comparison to Vol 1, vol 2 is very much more linear.  And herein lies the brilliance of this movie.  Tarantino bridges the two cultures and cinema styles, creating an epic that is part Japanese and part American old West.<br /><br />In Volume 2 we learn that everything we thought we knew is probably wrong.  By this, I'm referring to Bill.  In Vol 1 Bill is an insidious voice at the other end of the phone, one hand on his sword, moving it up and down.  We hear his raspy voice and that's about it.  He is an pitch black character.  In Vol 2, when we actually see Bill and get to know his character, Tarantino has changed our perspectives.  Yes he is evil, but not only that, he is human.  A lot more human than we are led to believe.  It's creepy and makes his character more real.<br /><br />The violence is more subdued this time than in the first one.  Where Vol 1 was a blood soaked revenge story, Vol 2 more resembles some of Tarantino's other stories.  It's filled with more awesome dialogue and more story.  Here we learn all of the answers to The Bride's past and how she got to where she was.<br /><br />There are still some awesome fight scenes.  The Bride's battle with Elle Driver is intense while strangely humorous.  My one complaint is that we have a 3 hour lead up to a very quick battle with Bill.  It's over too fast for me.  I was a bit let down.  Don't get me wrong, HOW it ends is excellent for reasons I won't spoil, but they get to that ending too fast unfortunately.  I was a bit disappointed.  But, that is a quibble in what is truly and excellent saga.  I can't say enough for this series.  It is amazing.</p></body></html>

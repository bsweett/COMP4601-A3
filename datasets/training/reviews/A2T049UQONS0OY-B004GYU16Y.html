<meta name="summary" content="A cartoonish action flick with political overtones"></head><body><p>Angelina Jolie plays the lead character in "Salt" ss a steroidal-driven CIA agent that mimics a Russian double agent intent on starting World War III. It takes a while to figure this out and you get to see Angelina go through scores of physical gyrations and stunts unlike anything her other cartoon character, Laura Kroft, ever achieved. For instance, at various times in this chase-filled film, Jolie:<br /><br />-- Scales skinny window sills of a high rise D.C. apartment building with her dog in the backpack -- in her bare feet.<br />-- Escapes capture by jumping from a freeway overpass onto a semi truck moving at freeway speed.<br />-- Jumps from that semi to a similarly haulin' gasoline tanker with a skinny grated deck.<br />-- Jumps to another vehicle moving at highway speed and hangs onto the edge by one hand before righting herself.<br /><br />All this without a scratch or without mussing her makeup or hair. Later on:<br /><br />-- She takes on at least 50 CIA agents in several combat scenes, without nary a scratch.<br />-- In purusit of the U.S. president, she repeatedly jumps downward in an elevator shaft, 3-4 floors at a time, always landing perfectly on little triangular steel ledges.<br />-- She survives and walks away from a car crash when the vehicle goes off the edge of a freeway, plummets 20-30 feet, and lands atop a bunch of other vehicles.<br /><br />She walks away from all this without a scratch. Oh yes, one time she cut herself. Later on, she destroys the funeral of the vice-president to the chagrin of 500 security agents and, to top that, saves the world from nuclear annihilation. If none of this is enough for you, in the final scene she takes a dive from a moving helicopter into a freezing ocean without a parachute or even her shirt, makes it to shore, then runs off into a fade to black screen, apparently setting the scene for "Salt II: The Return of Wonder Woman."<br /><br />To say this film defeats the concept of suspended disbelief is like saying the Hindenburg had a little accident. Whatever the merits of the film's story, acting, scenery and script, nothing can overcome its excessive, ridiculous and utterly laughable action sequences. No one can possibly believe, for one moment, that anything in this very high budget film could ever really have taken place.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Day Watching This One Is Better Than A Day At Work, But Barely."></head><body><p>This movie was watched on an afternoon where I was not at work. I wished I was at work because work makes my head hurt less than this movie did. It involves a Gulf War veteran who comes home and is framed for the death of a state trooper. He cannot explain what happened, and he is locked up for being criminally insane. When he is being treated he is locked in the morgue, but while he is he begins to travel through time. He gets a girlfriend, but she is someone he met when he is nine. It is all very complex, but that is not the problem. The problem is not bad acting. It is bad filming and poor editing. Heck, even Knightly is good. If you find this on TV it is worth a watch, but not worth buying.</p></body></html>

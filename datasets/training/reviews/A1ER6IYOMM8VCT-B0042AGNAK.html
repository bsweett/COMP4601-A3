<meta name="summary" content="OK ADAPTION TO THE CLASSIC COMIC ICON! 2 1/2 STARS!"></head><body><p>I am a huge Marvel comics fan from the 60's through 70's so, it is really disappointing for me to see such a great comic icon get such a mediocre movie. The FX's are fine but, the story is confusing and tedious. Cage and Co. are bland and don't appear too interested in what they're doing. It's not terrible but, it's not great by any stretch! Rent it don't buy it unless your a real die hard fan.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Odd and Funny"></head><body><p>I really<br />  like unusual films that you can't make much sense of them like Brazil<br />  or Fight Club and Being John Malkovich is right up there, it's about<br />  a puppeteer named Craig (John Cusack) and his obsession for his partner<br />  Maxine (Cathrine Keener) who doesn't really like him much, her ways<br />  of making him feel like 2 cents are hilarious. Well it's not all about<br />  that, did I mention Craig finds a doorway to John Malkovich's head<br />  that allows you to be John Malkovich and that him and Maxine start<br />  charging people that wanna try it. Oh yeah and Maxine is in love with<br />  Craig's wife, well when she's in Malkovich. The result is a wacky, funny and very original<br />  film with unusual charactors. A really good start for Spike Jonze,<br />  he should have a great career behind him if he makes more films as<br />  original as this.</p></body></html>

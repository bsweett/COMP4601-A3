The ultimate episode of the western wilderness just before it turned so sour that your blood would curdle in your veins and your brain would either calcify into a heartless stone or liquify into a tasteless brew. The solitary cowboy is the real judge and executioner, in one word that last fatal justice maker that represents the final fate of all crooked minds that meet with their destiny in front of the barrels of his guns just before he shoots them dead with no remission, no suspension, no parole, ever and never. Fatal lethal fateful fate of a big bang death of a few trashy men who thought their violence was god's law to all others. And God came down from his heaven in the shape of Clint Eastwood and he struck them dead with the flashes of lightning of his anger. Just before these hooligans learned that women had to be respected, that plain justice, fairness and humanity require strength, righteousness and forwardness. With only one star in sight guiding their steps, the star that leads to Bethlehem and the birth of a really humane world founded on the salvation of the innocent and the damnation  of the guilty, and not the reverse. Probably the acme of western films, the final touch to be able to close a long line of inspiration that has to come to its end since the audience has now lost their innocence. When justified violence is the angry redeeming tool of gratuitous and pleasurable cruelty. But that's also the end of a myth, the myth that there is a salvation of the innocent and the weak in this savage world that could not even think of existing if it were not brutal.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris I Panth&eacute;on Sorbonne,  University Paris Dauphine, Universit&eacute; Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></body></html>

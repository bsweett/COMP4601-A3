<meta name="summary" content="Improved, &quot;finished&quot; film"></head><body><p>While it's still flawed, Robert Wise's Director's Edition of ST:TMP shows a huge improvement in pacing, structure and optical effects. Wise had a release date before he had even shot one reel of footage and, as a result, was working against a deadline from day one. With optical effects problems from the very first (the company hired couldn't deliver despite spending 5 million dollars), the original set scrapped (it was build for the planned television series and wasn't detailed enough for the motion picture screen)as well as endless rewrites (Alan Dean Foster's original script was radically rewritten by Harold Livingston), power struggles, etc. Wise had his work cut out for him.<p>The resulting film was compromised from the get go. Eventually John Dykstra (Star Wars, Spiderman)and Douglas Trumbull(2001, Close Encounters)were brought in to complete the massive amount of effects work necessary for the film. Wise didn't get a chance to really fine tune the final cut of the film until this DVD release. He took the opportunity to also go back and redo some of the opticals they didn't have time to finish. The only priviso was that the effects had to look like they were created in 1979. The resulting final product is a marvel to watch.<p>A mysterious cloud posessing enormous power and, perhaps, with a craft at its center advances on Earth. Why it's coming is a mystery. After it disintegrates two Klingon war vessels and a Federation space station, the Federation elects the Enterprise to attept first contact or, failing that, try and destroy the visitor. <p>Admiral Kirk convinces Starfleet to let him command the Enterprise over Captain Decker (recommended by Kirk)because of his experience. The revamped Enterprise isn't quite space worthy yet but must be launched within 12 hours to allow the Enterprise time to cut off the alien visitor before it reaches Earth. <p>Wise uses a slower pace to create suspense in ST:TMP and it's quite different from other installments in the film franchise. The regal pacing and production design might, at first, put off fans of films 2-6 and The Next Generation. Keep in mind that ST:TMP is from a different generation of filmmaking. ST:TMP straddles the line between The Day the Earth Stood Still (another Wise film) and Wrath of Kahn.<p>The first disc includes a combined commentary track featuring Wise, Douglas Trumbull, John Dykstra, Jerry Goldsmith and others commenting on the stress and challenges of making of the original film. There's also comments from Wise about the changes made to the film for this DVD edition. The picture quality is exceptional although there are analog artifacts. Compression isn't an issue and I saw a bit of edge enhancement as well but, on the whole, it looks quite good. The remixed/remastered sound is a huge improvement on the original soundtrack (you can compare it to the deleted scenes to hear the difference). I'm not sure if this is an anamorphic widescreen transfer (it is presented in widescreen). The anamorphic transfer from video to DVd increases the resolution and clarity of the image. I believe it to be an anamorphic transfer but, again, have nothing to compare it against. <p>The second disc has all the extras including the scenes included in the 1979 version that were trimmed/cut/reshot for this edition. It also includes the extra scenes (including the infamous scene where Kirk goes after Spock outside the ship and you can see the edge of the set)for the 1983 television premiere as well. There's also feauturettes devoted to the new optical effects, publicity and interviews. There's also a section called Outtakes that focuses on an incomplete sequence that was replaced in the final film Spock going outside the ship and attempting to mind meld with the alien.<p>Although flawed with a script that was constantly being rewritten (with uncredited help from Leonard Nimoy), director Wise's film manages to capture both the sense of adventure and the larger than life qualities that made the series so popular. Keep in mind this film is less action oriented than other films in the franchise. It has more in common with the episodes like &quot;The Doomsday Machine&quot; and &quot;Nomad&quot; than it does &quot;City on the Edge of Forever&quot; or &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;. On its own, it's a fine film that has finally been finished in line with the vision Wise had for the film.</p></body></html>

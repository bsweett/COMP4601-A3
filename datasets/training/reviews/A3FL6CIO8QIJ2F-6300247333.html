<meta name="summary" content=""Surprisingly Good Film""></head><body><p>I had never seen "The Omen 3-The Final Conflict" until recently. After the first two versions in the "Omen" movies were released people pretty much forgot that there was a part three and ultimately a part four. In this film Sam Neill plays the adult Damien (the son of the anti-Christ) who now holds down a serious job as an Ambassador to England for the United States. He decides in order to control the world he must rid those who want to destroy him, namely a series of priests who know about him and his parentage.<br /> The movie is quite engrossing and involving. The story moves at a fast pace and the script is both strong and intelligent. The death scenes are not to be missed as the production is first rate and horrifying.<br /> Sam Neill steals the film as his performance is evil, convincing, and sexy. I never thought that when someone played the son of the devil that they would exude an overabundance of sexuality, but that's what Neill brings to his role. This is also Neill's first major Hollywood film with mainstream audiences knowing him now for turns in TV's "The Tudors" and "Jurassic Park".<br /> The movie is very short on bonuses, but there is an informative audio commentary by director Graham Baker.<br /> "The Omen 3-The Final Conflict" is available as a stand-alone DVD or as part of the impressive "Omen" boxset that features all the "Omen" films.</p></body></html>

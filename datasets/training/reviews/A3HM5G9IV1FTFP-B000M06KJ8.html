I doubt many people could deny that visually this film is stunning: the costume design, sets and art direction are spectacular. But the 80's soundtrack and languid, dreamy tone are sure to polarize the audience.<br /><br />For the most part, I thought it all worked. This film portrays Marie Antoinette as a privileged, yet controlled and smothered, teenager. Arranged to marry the prince of France, her political survival depends on her giving birth to an heir. Unfortunately, her awkward husband, for reasons that are never really clear, can't consummate their marriage. So Marie Antoinette blows off steam by enjoying her stilted life the only ways she can: by spending loads of cash, partying nonstop and, eventually, finding some sense of purpose in motherhood.<br /><br />Kirsten Dunst gives an understated, yet somehow charismatic, performance as the young queen. And although the film probably amounts to more style than substance, it's still well worth watching.</p></body></html>

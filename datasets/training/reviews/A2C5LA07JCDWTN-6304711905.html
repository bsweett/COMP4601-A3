Kurt Russell does a fantastic job portraying former Sheriff Wyatt Earp. Russell's Earp is at a crossroads in his life and sure, really, of only two things: he wants to make a lot of money and he wants to live near his two brothers Virgil (Sam Elliott) and Morgan (Bill Paxton). Needless to say when the Earp three move into the ragtag town of Tombstone business picks up a bit. The Earp's go into the saloon/casino business and start to clean up which begins to rub a few of the local cowboys the wrong way. All the ensuing altercations lead to the historic shootout at the OK Corral which is one of the films many highlights. Wyatt's sidekick is perhaps the best thing about Tombstone. Val Kilmer turns in an unforgettable performance as Doc Holiday. Holiday is by far the most intriguing character in the film and endears himself to the viewer almost instantly. Kilmer simply steals every scene he is in, which makes for one of the most memorable (and lovable) movie characters of all-time. Although Doc's hedonistic lifestyle eventually catches up with him in the end, it sure is great to watch this &quot;fabulous disaster.&quot; The film is long but it doesn't feel it. The pacing is fantastic and almost all of the movie is action packed. Overall, Tombstone is easily in my top five favorite films of all-time...and on some days it's number 1. Highest Recommendation.</p></body></html>

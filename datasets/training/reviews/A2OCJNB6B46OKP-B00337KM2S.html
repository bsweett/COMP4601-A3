<meta name="summary" content="Up In The Air is Down To Earth."></head><body><p>In a time when our world changing far too quickly, there is always a film that comes along to define the sign of the times. This time George Clooney takes us into the mind of a man who just flat out hates being around people and involved with their lives. Guess what he does for a living? He has to fire people from their jobs and connect with them in order to motivate them to find a new opportunity.  So now what do you do when your line of work is telling you have to stop avoiding all connections and stay grounded? That is what the film `Up In The Air' is all about.<br /><br />I knew that there was a huge buzz about this movie and I have to say I got a lot more than I expected out of this movie. First of all the cast is crazy amazing. Everyone from Clooney to Kendrick plays their roles unbelievably well. Anna Kendrick was of course my favorite, just because I was in her exact position not too long ago. I remember learning the tricks of the trade in my line of work and traveling to sit down with prospects. I remember sitting in a car almost crying because I found the job to be too much or just wondering if I was going to able to do this on my own for a living. What I loved about the film the most was how it depicted how distant we are becoming as a creature. How we break up with our significant others over a text message or that we can't sit face to face in the room with someone when we have to give them negative news. It shows that it turns us into soulless and spineless people. Whether you would agree with my views or not...that was what I got out of this film. Understand that this film can depress you at points, but it is a comedy and it has some great laughable moments and yes you do get a nice ending.<br /><br />This is a movie that I recommend you see at least once, because it just a story about ordinary people trying to live the lives they want to live. That is something we as individuals do every day. The question is what makes you stand out amongst the others.</p></body></html>

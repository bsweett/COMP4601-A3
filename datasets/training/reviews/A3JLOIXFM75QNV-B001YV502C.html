And it did a fine job of portraying the effects. Though there really wasn't any type of explanation as to WHY no one could conceive any more. Visually, the movie is gorgeous. Its crazy and bleak all at the same time. Clive Owen gave a perfect performance. However, I have a major gripe with the ending. No spoilers here. But I mean, it just ended. And what? It sort of just leaves you hanging without hope or expectations. It jarred me from the otherwise brilliant film.</p></body></html>

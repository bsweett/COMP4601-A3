It is just too bad that a better film could not have been made from Isaac Asimov's influential source material.<br /><br />Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) investigates an apparent suicide at the U.S. Robotics building.  His mistrust of robots leads him to believe that there is more to the suicide of Doctor Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) than meets the eye.  Suspicion starts to focus on a robot named Sonny (Alan Tudyk) despite U.S. Robotics' insistence that none of their robots could possibly hurt, much less kill, a human being.<br /><br />"I, Robot" is a film that could have been an insightful examination into the nature of the synthetic consciousness.  Unfortunately, it aims lower in its ambition and instead chooses to be more about car chases, fistfights, and special effects galore.  Yet, "I, Robot" is still fun on the most basic of levels.  Smith's natural charisma shines through from start to finish and there is enough brain candy present to engage your mind.  The design of the robots take some getting used to and Bridget Moynahan is totally ineffective in her role, but "I, Robot" has enough going for it to make it worthy of a look-see.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Heresy! Forsaking blu due to package art alone!"></head><body><p>In 2006, was introduced to this marvellous work by a co-worker who said this was her favorite film ("and you love movies and you've never SEEN it? You MUST!"). Bought this Legacy edition (was then the "latest/greatest" release of film), and oh yes, total agreement with her opinion. Strangely enough, she never acquired a copy herself, so when she recently retired, I gave her my copy (tri-fold, with lobby cards: a LOVELY set). Went shopping for replacement, saw glowing reviews for new blu, but (for my 1st time ever), opted to just replace the original Legacy copy, ONLY due to it's cover/overall packaging. BEFORE you start bashing, read DVD reviews going back to '98 release: they are uniformly excellent for quality (and extras). I do not care for Universal's new packaging art, but I suppose they really could not improve on the Legacy (nor could they reproduce it for a new release). If quality of packaging is no big deal, consider the new release; if having an exquisite TRULY "Collector's Ed." (what an overused term in dvd market) in your library is paramount -or to give as gift- I would recommend the Legacy. (please note, the 2nd used copy I just bought has only a bi-fold case, and no lobby cards. Still pleased with, and my friend DID get those added items!). Bottom line: an absolute film treasure, get whatever copy you can get your hands on!</p></body></html>

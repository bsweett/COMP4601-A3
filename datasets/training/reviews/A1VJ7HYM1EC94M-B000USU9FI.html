<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Spin on a Classic"></head><body><p>When I first learned there would be a re-make of what may be my favorite movie I cringed.  I remember the horrors visited upon Cassevetes classic "Gloria" when Sharon Stone - missing every subtlety Gena Rowlands brought to the film - turned it into an almost drag queen performance.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when Jonathan Demme came up with enough clever new twists and turns to the original plot to make it an entirely different movie - variations on a theme if you will.<br /><br />The performances are all strong with Meryl Streep sinking her teeth into a role that is as strong a female character as ever committed to the screen.  She's sensationally evil.  Denzel looks less glamorous and more believably gritty and insane as he tries to unravel the mystery of what happened to him and his army troupe during the first Gulf War.<br /><br />Demme and company hold our interest throughout and couple of hours whiz right by, thoroughly entertaining and, at times, appropriately chilling.</p></body></html>

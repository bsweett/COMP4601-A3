Some Americans have probably heard of the Tuskegee airmen, black American servicemen who became unwitting test subjects for medical experiments.  But how many people are aware of the medical testing performed on ignorant prisoners, on poor people on various Caribbean islands, or the large-scale testing of vaccines on African villagers throughout the latter half of the 20th century.  The latter tragedy was the background for the movie "The Constant Gardener" but it was kept in the background.  This movie takes medical experimentation and puts it front and center in the middle of America.<br /><br />The plot is simple; two clones discover that they were created to have their organs harvested.  They then fight to escape, and then to help others like them escape.  The story takes on the issues of cloning, genetic engineering, mind control, and even the power of corporations operating in the medical sphere.  Yes the story has the requisite action scenes and love scene needed for any Hollywood flick, but it also has enough scenes to explore the medical and moral issues involved.  We have Lincoln's real counterpart, a rich, spoiled yuppie who needs replacement organs because his are suffering from STD's he has picked up from various women.  Then there is the scene when Scarlett Johansson's character sees the son of her real counterpart.  And then there is the scene where Djimon Hounsou's character parallels the medical cloning with the atrocities he witnessed in his homeland in Africa.  All in all, this was a great action movie with heart and a meaning.  A great watch.</p></body></html>

A Special Ops team is called in to contain the situation and retreive top secret research data.  Leading the team is Sarge (The Rock), a gung-ho, shoot-first-ask-questions-later-if-he-feels-like-it soldier.  Reluctantly accompanying him is Reeper (Karl Urban), searching for his sister Sam (Rosamund Pike).<br /><br />What they find on Mars is a disaster area.  The few survivors left are scared, worried...but their troubles have just begun.  For there are horrible secrets here, secrets so profound that the soldiers may be forced to take whatever means necessary to keep them hidden.  But secrets may become a moot point...for the troubles of this isolated Mars research station may soon find a new home...on Earth...<br /><br />I didn't come to this movie with high expectations.  I grew up on "Doom" the game (I wasn't a fanatic, but there's something cathartic about blowing away demons with your precious BFG), and so I seriously doubted the ability to transfer it to the big screen.  In part, I was right; this isn't your video game, despite some attempts to recreate the first-person shooter format (which, surprisingly, isn't as cheesy as you might think, and is indeed somewhat enjoyable).  I expected wooden acting, fake-looking monsters, and a by-the-book plot.  Well, the plot is what you'd expect (if you've seen one, you've seen 'em all, and so forth), but the monsters are genuinely disturbing, if not outright terrifying, and the acting is much better than would be expected.  Also, there are some unique plot twists that help raise this movie above its peers.  Is "Doom" the absolute best sci-fi/action/horror movie ever?  Nope.  It's not as revolutionary as its namesake, but it IS a darned good popcorn flick, and much better than many of its kind.  If you like the genre, you'll definitely like "Doom."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Is she really a monster?"></head><body><p>Charlize Theron is simply amazing in this engrossing, fact-based thriller. She is extremely convincing as serial killer Aileen Wuornos, giving a haunting and well-deserved Oscar-nominated performance. The otherwise gorgeous star transforms into the not so gorgeous killer and gives a very eerie and sympathetic performance. I was wowed.<p>Charlize Theron may rule the film, but the always wonderful Christina Ricci is very good as well, playing her love interest Selby. She brings an immature vulnerability and wide-eyed innocence to her character and pulls a real person out of what could be just a ball of insecurities.<p>This is not a movie that is easy to sit through; it is dark, ugly, and violent. An early scene in which Aileen is raped is almost traumatizing at best, it is so lacking in any form of humanity. In another scene, a too-far-gone Aileen comes across an elderly gentleman who is genuinely willing to help the woman, but that isn't something that Aileen is prepared to deal with if it comes from a man. His needless death is an eye-opening turning point to the film, when it really sinks in that this woman is hopelessly lost and can probably never be found.<p>Fair warning: this is a dark, harshly severe movie with no relief until the house lights come up, but if you can disconnect yourself from the onscreen horrors for a few moments, you'll see a story of humanity's worst nightmare: individuals cast aside with no ability to crawl out of the hole into which they've been thrown. There is certainly a message here that needs to be heard, and this movie is one that should be seen. I highly recommend it to those with an open mind, but it is definitely not for the squeamish. It is however one of the best of 2003 and includes NO DOUBT one of the best performances in modern cinema.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="BUY THE 50TH ANNIVERSAY EDITION,IF YOU CAN FIND IT! AVOID THE 60TH RE-ISSUE"></head><body><p>This is a classic film and should be in everyone's holiday DVD collection. The 50th Anniversay Edition is superb with excellent sound and picture. The 60th Anniversay is the same print,but on the one I viewed,there were some annoying audio pops in a couple of spots! Buy the 50th Ann. Ed. it is well worth looking for. One of the best holiday movies ever made!</p></body></html>

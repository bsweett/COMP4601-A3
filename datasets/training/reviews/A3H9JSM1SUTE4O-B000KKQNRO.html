<meta name="summary" content="DA VINCI DUD -- TALKY, HEAVY-HANDED AND NOT THRILLING"></head><body><p>How can you turn a murder mystery thriller, a clever-premised  world wide global best-seller into a boring dud of a movie? That's the real mystery here.  This piece of film fiction is NOT a lecture or a documentary it just feels like one.<br /><br />By taking itself way too seriously, the filmmaking conspirators destroyed the fun of the ride.<br /><br />The audacious premise may be blasphemy to some and heresy to others.  But the real unforgivable sin here is that the movie is boring.<br /><br />Even Tom Hanks said it's just a movie about a bunch of "religious hooey."  But the sin of the filmmakers is that by trying to stick to the letter of the book and not the mood, wrecked the story and it got off track on its way to becoming a movie -- and the film derailed.<br /><br />That said, the movie version of Dan Brown's "The Da Vinci Code" works best for those who buy into the hoopla and publicity and still think the book is factual and not clever fiction.  It's kind of like those great speculative recreations on the History Channel.<br /><br />Brian Grazer is an astute producer who often has his finger on the pop culture pulse and Ron Howard is a gifted director, but here they were unable -- or afraid -- to boldly guide Akiva Goldsman's screenplay away from the novel and into a blueprint that would make the breathless page-turner a disturbing, edge-of-your-seat thriller.<br /><br />If you're interested in the dark side of the Catholic Church, check out the non-fiction books "The Bad Popes" by E.R. Chamberlin and "In God's Name" by David Yallop.  Or Google the Spanish Inquisition.  Dan Brown's fiction pales in comparison to historical reality.</p></body></html>

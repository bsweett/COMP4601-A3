<meta name="summary" content="She Never Sleeps!"></head><body><p>I enjoy good horror movies and this is good. When a group of teenagers view a movie while at a cabin they seal their fate. When a newspaper woman investigates she opens the door to a mystery that may well kill her.<p>Spooky images, dead horses, visions of ladders, wells, and more along with some good acting make this worth seeing. When the reporter, her ex-husband and son view the tape they only have seven days to live unless they can unravel the clues to the mystery.<p><p> I must admit my wife and I were a bit spooked when at almost 10 PM exactly right after we watched this movie the telephone rang. When she told her son that we just watched "The Ring" we all had a laugh.<p>Although I thought this was an excellent movie, I don't see me watching it repeatedly so I gave it three stars instead of four. Like fear.com it is well worth seeing, I just would not buy it myself. It doesn't have the replayability of "The Sixth Sense" or "The Others".</p></body></html>

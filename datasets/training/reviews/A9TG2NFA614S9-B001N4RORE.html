I've seen it three times on stage so was prepped for the movie version. It was fun to watch the way they movie-masters opened up the stage version to the panoramic natural setting of the beautiful Greek islands although the expansiveness didn't always click. Originally the musical's creators took some catchy Abba songs and wove them together into a plot-line that was above-average or more sophisticated than is usual when musical-makers start with a canon of songs.<br /> In Blu-Ray the Greek island settings are gorgeous. Meryl Streep is exceptionally good in this version as is Pierce Brosnan. Neither one comes over very well in the CD soundtrack when you can't see them acting because their voices can't carry the day alone. The entire cast does a creditable job.<br />Some of the musical numbers are way over-produced and over-peopled. Less would have been better. The early number "Money, Money, Money" is way over the top. The yacht scenes bear no reference to the island life and are a phony dream sequence. Some numbers are hectic, frenetic and seem like they're filmed in fast motion. There are too many extras bouncing up and down to the Abba beat and overpopulating the screen. Too many Greek peasant women and armies of dancers come advancing off the screen and into your lap. Everyone is dancing their hearts away.<br />Audiences unused to the unreality of the old-fashioned movie musicals are going to be overwhelmed by the overkill. We have forgotten how to suspend disbelief when it comes to the openness of musicals. Breaking into song has become bizarre for those unused to the old genre.<br />Meryl Streep uses her particular acting skills to put over certain numbers particularly "The Winner Takes It All."<br />It seems foolish to quibble about a movie that has a lot of laughs, burlesque turns, snappy popsicle music, a pretty good plot, and keeps you entertained.<br />The movie has a vitality, a joie de vivre that is certainly good for these hard economic times. Just don't expect Sondheim or Leonard Bernstein. The DVD is crammed with extra features for those who have the time. This is a movie for those who crave sheer exuberance.</p></body></html>

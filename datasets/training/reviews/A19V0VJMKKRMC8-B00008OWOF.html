It Was Surprisingly Good But Very Long.<br />Frank Abagnale Was Only 19 Years Old When He Became The Most<br />Wanted Con Man In America. Carl A FBI Agent Will Do Anything To<br />Catch Abagnale. His Father Frank Abagnale Senior Wont Let Him CatchHis Son. With Over $3,000,000 In Fraudulent Checks The Search Is on.Christopher Walken , Leonardo Di Caprio , And Tom Hanks All Deserve Oscars. This In Fact Deserves Best Picture. It's Got My Vote. This MovieIs An Brilliant And Well Played Masterpiece Where There's Never A Dull Moment. Steven Spielberg Finnallly Got It Right. Two Huge Thumbs Way Way Up.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Magnificently brilliant insanity!"></head><body><p>Given all that we know about the legends of King Arthur, the Holy Grail, and Knights Who Say Ni, it's about time someone crammed them all together in one movie. Not to mention some very nice shrubbery. Well, back in 1975, the lunatics that were Monty Python decided to destory any credibility these legends might have.<p>This brilliant farce is the stuff of legend itself. What with Wizards called Tim, killer bunny rabbits, and one knight that just doesn't know when to quit.<p>If you've never seen this film, shame on you. It should be required viewing for every member of the human race.</p></body></html>

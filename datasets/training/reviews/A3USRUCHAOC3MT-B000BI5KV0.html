<meta name="summary" content="An Amazing Look At Nature Appropriate For All Ages"></head><body><p>Do you want a movie that is:<br />1) Paced enough for adults to be able to enjoy?<br />2) Is suitable for the whole family to watch together, without worrying about blood and guts or gratious sex or bad language?<br />3) Will educate as well as entertain?<br />4) Is realistic?<br />5) Is considered worthy enough to win an Oscar?<br /><br />This movie fits all of the above.  How often do you find that?<br /><br />This movie was originally a French movie, but it is one of the rare films that can be translated to any language and be equally entertaining.  After all, enjoying nature is probably universal, and except for the billions who live in Antartica (what do you mean there aren't a billion people in Antartica?!), this is a region of the world that is a mystery, which again makes the movie more appealing.  Our version has Morgan Freeman reading the script, and doing a good job; but then there are probably few people who would not have done a good job (Little Richard comes to mind; my apologies if he or a friend of his is reading this).<br /><br />This movie, as I said, is suitable for the whole family to view together.  I don't believe any television or movies should be watched by unsupervised children (including Sesame Street and Barney), and there are definitely some scenes that a parent will want to be there to talk to their child.  It deals with life and death, after all, and while the scenes are not as graphic as a lot of movies are, it would be wise to be there with your child.<br /><br />For example, how many of you have seen sweet cuddly seals at the zoo?  I remember seeing the trainer trying to urge one into the cage, a seal (named Max) who would get to the edge of the cage and then waddle away, and finally dove into the water.  The scene with a leopard seal will show a completely different side of seals, and that scene is pretty intense.<br /><br />Another thing about this movie:  it is silent about the origins issue.  One is allowed to come up to their own conclusions if the penguin adapted itself as finely tuned as it was by the miracle of evolution and natural selection, or if a master artist designed this species, and gave it instincts that help it survive in an extremely harsh environment.  (Of course, some people on either side of the debate despises the concept of a person coming to their own conclusions, in fear that they would come to the wrong choice.)<br /><br />One important thing:  DO NOT STOP THIS MOVIE WHEN THE FINAL CREDITS START ROLLING!!!  Understand?  There are some great scenes that were not in the movie as you see the credits roll.<br /><br />The DVD has some special features.  One is a nearly hour long segment which partially retells the story of the actual movie, and partially tells about the filming and relating to the penguins.  This includes some of the movie footage, the footage I mentioned in the closing credits, and none of the above.  I would say this segment, titled "Of Penguins And Men", is not for the whole family, solely because it is above the heads of most children, and they might be bored with this segment.<br /><br />To make up for it, they have added (not surprisingly for a Warner Bros. release) a Bugs Bunny cartoon which includes a penguin.  This is not anywhere realistic, or based on the research that went into the movie, but so what?  It will amuse the Bugs fans.  (Another feature is the trailer for the movie.)</p></body></html>

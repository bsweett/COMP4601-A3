After all, directed by Richard Burton, Music by Prince, how can you go wrong? Well it kept my attention and parts of it were enjoyable but mostly it just drove me `batty'. I didn't care for the tepid, lukewarm love story that was sewn into this movie. I find Bill and Hillary's romance more exciting frankly.<br /><br />Next there was Michael Keaton. I don't think he kept his identity as Batman a secret, instead I think it was just that he didn't even realize he was Batman himself. He wanders though this movie in a daze. It's like he didn't realize the camera was rolling and was just killing time until the director yelled "action!" In short this is no different from any other movie he's played in.<br /><br />How did Jack Nicholson fare in this movie? Not bad, although this was the 5th or so film where he played the psycho dad from The Shining. I hear that when he was asked how long he studied for this film his answer was, "as little as possible."<br /><br />This movie also took a lot of liberties assuming we were familiar with the whole Batman world. Therefore nothing is foreshadowed. When he needs to make a quick getaway we're introduced to the bat-grappling hook. When they're driving through the bad part of the neighborhood there's bat-mobile-bat-armor. Meanwhile his love interest ponders on whether he wears bat-boxers or bat-briefs.<br /><br />Still compared with the latest pablum excreted from Hollywood I'd sit back and enjoy Batman anyday.</p></body></html>

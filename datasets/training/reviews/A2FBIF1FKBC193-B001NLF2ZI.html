<meta name="summary" content="Like watching a love affair between a turtle and a porcupine ..."></head><body><p>My goodness what a thoroughly disgusting surprise ... I should have know better based on the Amazon price of this DVD used ....<br /><br />Ok so lets see first what's good about this movie ..... it was cheap ..<br /><br />OK now whats bad ... The most aggravating thing was that when Penn wasn't mumbling and we had to turn the volume up to try to follow the movie, Kidman raced through her dialogue giving the impression she really didn't believe it either and just wanted to get back to her trailer. She appeared a little bigger in this film than in the Eyes Wide Shut film .... implants ... HMMM<br /><br />The writing in this movie is disjointed ... confusing ... seemed like it's out of sequence ... We never really do understand the Kidman character .. is she a sweet innocent, NO is she a freedom fighter, NO is she a loyal UN employee No ... what in the world was she supposed to be .... she turns out to be just a prickly porcupine type character ....<br /><br />I actually didn't want this DVD after seeing Sean Penn play patty cake with Saddam Hussein so I DID TRY to separate the actor from the person here... now I have decided I don't like him as a person or an actor now ..<br /><br />What a disappointment for a movie that I was truly looking foreward to seeing .....</p></body></html>

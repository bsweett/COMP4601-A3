<meta name="summary" content="I would never erase someone now that I know."></head><body><p>The first 17 minutes or so of the movie shows Joel (Jim Carrey) waking up...going to work...and then freaking out. He has this sudden urge to rush to Montague (I'm not sure where that's at though). Joel is not the kinda of person that is spontaneous like that. But for some reason...he just has to go to Montague. He gets to a beach and sees a pretty girl in an orange sweater with blue hair. Being shy..he doesnt talk to her. But she notices him. When he is leaving Montague he notices that the girl is on the train with him now. The girl comes over and starts talking to him and introduces herself as Clementine (Kate Winslett). They hit it off and spend the whole day together having a great and wonderful and exciting (especially for Joel) time.<br /><br />Then the title credits start to appear and Joel is crying his eyes out. We come to find out that when he goes into the store where Clementine works, she is completely ignoring him. So Joel is crushed and then his friends let him know what really happened. She erased him. Erased him from her mind. He's gone to her. So he's devastated and wants to do the same to her.<br /><br />And that's when the real movie begins in my opinion. As the doctor begins to erase his memories, Joel is remembering most of them at the same time. So he's witnessing his memories dissapearing right before him. We come to find out that he's had a long relationship with Clementine. One that seemed like it was really fun and had so much love with the occasional arguing that most couples in love have. As Joel is remembering and actually living out these memories again, he realizes he screwed up and he doesn't want to lose Clementine forever. So he tries to wake up but cant. So he does the next best thing... he tries to hide her in memories that she shouldn't belong in. All the while you are sitting and watching their relationship from Joel's memories and you just want to wake him up yourself and send him off to get Clementine back.<br /><br />This is not your typical love story. I found the love that Clementine and Joel share much more believable in this movie. They are opposites from each other. Joel is shy and Clementine is outgoing. Joel makes plans and Clementine is spontaneous. Joel is careful of his actions and Clementine is carefree. They both helped each other out. Clementine would help Joel have more fun in life, while Joel would help Clementine calm down just a tad. Many love stories have the same plot and the same fairy tale feel to it. This one didn't.<br /><br />The reason why I give this movie a 4 and not a 5 is that there were some things in the movie that I just thought were getting in the way. I didn't like Kirsten Dunst's role between her and the main doctor. I thought the way the movie ended was definitley cool, but I still wish I coulda seen more.<br /><br />I think everyone should at least watch this movie once. Especially if you are in love or have been in love.</p></body></html>

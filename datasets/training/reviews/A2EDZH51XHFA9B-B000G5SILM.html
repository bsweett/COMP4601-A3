Well, now I've seen it, and I think I know why-- I'm guessing Fox, once it saw the finished product, was a bit reluctant to release it. That, or embarrassed. Clark Johnson (probably best remembered for his acting-- he played Meldrick Lewis on the wonderful Homicide: Life on the Street) is very good at directing for the small screen-- he's done some great work on The Shield, including the pilot episode-- but as his big-screen adventures have shown, it's not translating well.<br /><br />The plot, for those of you who missed it in the trailers: Pete Garrison (Michael Douglas), a decorated Secret Service member, is accused of being a mole. His former best friend, David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland), is pursuing the case with, shall we say, a good deal of overeagerness thanks to a fallout between the two some years before. Meanwhile, the real mole is planning something dastardly having to do with the President (United 93's David Rasche).<br /><br />Much of the movie's lackluster pace and overall silliness can be pinned on scriptwriter George Nolfi (whose previous claim to fame was Ocean's Twelve; need I say more?), but its disheveled appearance is all on Johnson. You'd think someone who can make The Shield almost palpably slimy would be able to work with this stuff. And I've never quite figured out why it's so tough for successful TV directors to make the switch to the big screen, but The Sentinel provides more evidence for the hypothesis that it's so. **</p></body></html>

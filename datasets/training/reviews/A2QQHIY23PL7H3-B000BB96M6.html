<meta name="summary" content="The first flick was tastier"></head><body><p>I went into Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with high expectations. Comparisons to the Gene Wilder original aside, Burton had promised a darker movie that was truer to Roald Dahl's classic book. With modern special effects, that sounded like something to experience.<br /><br />The good news is that if you've read the novel, this flick does incorporate many of the elements that the 70s version left out. You get your Indian Prince story, a much grander boat ride down the river of chocolate, and the infamous scene in the nut room. Charlie's father is also back in the story now, and has his job in the toothpaste factory.<br /><br />But then the flick takes some odd turns of its own. The Oompa-Loompa songs use the original lyrics from the novel, but take off in a very garish direction that's neither good nor bad, just...bizzare. Johnny Depp, for all the critical acclaim he's had playing eccentric characters, feels rather forced here. He's distinctive and amusing, but I can't help but feel Gene Wilder was closer to what Dahl envisioned. Finally, the movie tacks on a very sappy subplot about Wonka's dentist father and his parental issues. For all that Burton said about making this movie darker, these parts felt as sugary as the happy ending in the original.<br /><br />I like the Burton version, but oddly enough I still find the 70s original to be a truer interpretation of the whimsical and discomforting world Dahl created. The best effort would probably be a mix of both, and it might be worth another remake 20 more years down the road to see that happen. This deluxe version has some okay extras, but not enough to justify the price tag difference if you see the bare-bones one significantly cheaper. Fans will want both versions for comparisons, families are probably better off investing in the 70s version and saving this one for a rental.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Everything the Rocketeer should have been!"></head><body><p>This movie reminds me of a Disney film long ago, about Dave Stevens character, "The Rocketeer."  If Disney had CGI at the time, the movie would have been a success.  This one is in the spirit of the old time movie serials and while the action wasn't over the top in many places it was a very good movie. I did like the fact that, as one of the reviewers put it, there was no modern profanity and nudity.  It'd be out of place in this perfect movie about a retro future that looks like it came straight out of the 1940's art deco era.  I wonder if Dave Stevens is promoting a new version of his character after watching this?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="'V' fails to deliver the statement it works so hard to make..."></head><body><p>`V' opened to critical acclaim as well as critical controversy.  I never got around to seeing it in the theater, and even after its DVD release it's taken me months to give it a look.  I will say that, while the film is visually engaging, I found myself wondering what all the hype was about.  `V' just never got around to grabbing my interest the way I expected it to, and with all the `Matrix' comparisons I expected a little more in the action department, but the film is sorely lacking in that area as well.<br /><br />The film circles around a terrorist named V (Hugo Weaving) who is disgusted with the country's current situation.  England is under the rule of Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) who rules by instilling fear in the eyes of the nation.  V happens upon young Evey (Natalie Portman) who unwillingly becomes his prodigy, but when a close friend is murdered at the hands of the government she becomes a little more willing to help make a statement.<br /><br />That's precisely what this movie tries to do, make a statement, but it falls short of a memorable one.  The acting too was a bit of a sore spot.  Yes, Hugo does a fine job, but he had a mask on the entire time so it makes acting a bit easier...the audience has no chance to read your face and know your phony.  Portman to me was a huge disappointment.  She seemed miscast and slightly out of her element.  She showed so much promise with `Closer' that I expected her to really soar here and I was sadly let down.<br /><br />The action and or directing this movie took are decent, and the few fight and or action sequences are highlights to the film, but they are few as I mentioned, and I expected more of them.  The movie tries really hard to make a point, to have a moral backdrop but it just doesn't come across on the screen.  I've read that Alan Moore (the writer of the graphic novel of which this movie is based) was not pleased with the film.  I've never read his novel, but I can assume (since Hollywood has a really bad problem with this) that it was drastically changed for the big screen.  Either way, I don't really understand all the hype, but this film does have it's supporters.  It's not a bad movie but it's far from the masterpiece some would have you believe!</p></body></html>

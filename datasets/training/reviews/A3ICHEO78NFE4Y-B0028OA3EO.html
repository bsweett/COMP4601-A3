<meta name="summary" content="Politically correct....Why????"></head><body><p>I wanted so much to enjoy this new version but what happened to "Truth, Justice and the American Way?"  There is NO American Flag or American Way.  Those of us who were raised in the 50's will understand that Superman was an American hero.  It's not that way any more.  It seems like Warner Brothers went out of the way to make this Superman politically correct.  I can not recommend this film.  Everything that Superman should and did stand for is "No More."  I was very very disappointed.</p></body></html>

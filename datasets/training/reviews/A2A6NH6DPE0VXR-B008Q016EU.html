You got awesome Matrix style action, a lot of funny moments and cool villains. Crispen Glover (Back To The Future) as the lead Henchman the Thin Man kicks major Angel butt. I can't picture their being a sequel without him he was so cool. Sam Rockwell (Galaxy Quest, The Green Mile) and Kelly Lynch make cool baddies as well. It's Cameron Diaz that steals the show, though, with her underwear dance, one word describes that part: "WOW." She has the funniest lines in the movie, she delivers them great too. She's just hilarious in this movie. <p>The only problem I had with the film was that it didn't need all the big names in small roles. Tom Green doesn't really fit in the movie as......CHAD, the guy who likes to say his own name. You got Matt LeBlanc as Lucy Liu's boyfriend too. Matt is basically just playing his part Joey from (Friends) and it doesn't really work. L.L Cool J has a small cameo in the beginning as the guy Drew is disguised as, which doesn't work that well either. Luke Wilson (Blue Streak, Home Fries) as Cameron Diaz's love interest is pretty funny though too bad the movie doesn't come through at actually putting those two together . <p>Some of the action is cartoonish but still a lot of fun at the time because none of the actors take what they're doing seriously. Charlie's Angels can best be described as True Lies with action like the Matrix. I highly recommend it, for those of you that think it looks dumb, check it out anyway because you might like it...I did. OK, now all we need is Magnum: The Movie and we'll all be happy, lol.</p></body></html>

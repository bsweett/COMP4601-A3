<meta name="summary" content="An entertaining and fun movie to watch!"></head><body><p>A wimp who is so small and weak that he cannot even get into the military has a few other things going for him. He has bravery and the sense to do the right then when needed. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) joins a military program after he comes to the attention of a German scientist working for the Americans. He is transformed into a fighting warrior whose goal is to help win WWII and support the American way.<br /><br />Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) is the lead female actress in the movie and she slowly becomes infatuated with Captain America and he also likes her. While it does not go much further in the movie it creates a little romantic side plot.<br /><br />The villain is the Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) who leads the Nazi war machine and technology division to defeat the world for his own plans to take shape!<br /><br />When I watch a movie made from the story line of a comic book I look for a few things:<br />-Is it interesting?<br />-Is there a lot of good action?<br />-Is it true to the original story?<br />-Are the special effects good enough to enhance the comic book's story?<br />-Did the movie make the comic book characters seem real to life?<br />-When it is all done did I enjoy it?<br /><br />This movie met all the above questions with a yes answer from me. My family enjoyed it and it was fun to watch.</p></body></html>

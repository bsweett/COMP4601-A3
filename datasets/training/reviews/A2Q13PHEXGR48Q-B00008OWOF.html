<meta name="summary" content="Good DiCaprio and Hanks"></head><body><p>Catch Me if You Can is a entertaining movie about a young man who takes the identity of numerous occupations, including pilot, doctor, and many others, and is being pursued by the FBI.  Frank Abagnale JR(DiCaprio) does all this as a way to impress his father, played to perfection by Christopher Walken.  The movie follows the FBI's pursuit of the young crook over the period of four years.  This is a good movie with not much to it, but is still worth a view.<p> The actors in this movie are what make it as good as it is.  DiCaprio is very good as Abagnale with Hanks his usual excellent self as Carl Hanratty, the FBI agent in pursuit of Abagnale.  Walken was very deserving of his Oscar nomination for his role as DiCaprio's father.  At times he is funny and then other times you feel so bad for him.  During some conversations, I couldn't help but think this was a lot like the relationship between Biff and Willy Loman.  The DVD is packed full of extras that give a lot of coverage to behind the scenes stuff.  A good movie that deserves a viewing if nothing else.</p></body></html>

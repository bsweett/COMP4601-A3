My brother kept saying, oh you gotta see goodfellas have you seen it, so I watched it, and was enjoying deniro and liotta, and up until one of the most nauseating scenes I had to shut it off for time out. (And believe me, I am NEVER phased when it comes to gruesome murder in movies.) But I did not expect it at all. It was when the goodfellas were all wacking each other, and they were sitting in the car with the fat guy who talked too much, and it's a frontal view and you first see the fat guy shaking in his seat and he was gurgling in pain and dying. I knew they were gonna kill him, but I just was not expecting something that brutal and sick. And it showed joe pesci pull an ice pick slowly out of the back of his head, (after digging it around in his brain) and all he said was I THOUGHT HE WOULD NEVER SHUT UP. Suddenly, I felt dizzy, like I was going to faint. That never happened to me before. We all know the mafia is well known for their vicious and brutal murders, but why couldnt they just pop him in the head quickly with a silencer gun. It basically made pesci's character even more of an unremorseful, cold blooded killer, and it was not even a problem for him. I think why it was so disturbing is it is a true story. It's sickening that the mob is having drinks one minute as buddies they've known their whole lives, and then sticking knives in each other's heads the next. I'm wondering if anyone stomached that scene well or not. Or is it just me? It's just a bit too much. Blah!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="See the Original!"></head><body><p>One has to wonder why re-makes are made of good movies.  The bad movies should be re-made to try to make them better.  Good movies are good, so why try to re-make them . . . I always enjoyed the Sinatra/Harvey original, which was crisp, credible, and where one can identify with the characters, and have feelings for them.  In this remake, there is very little, if anything or anyone that deserves empathy.  It is presented in a backdrop of doom.  Washington never smiles thoughout the movie and his character is so dark, one wonders how he can get up in the morning.  Raymond Shaw jockeys between a glad-handing and inciteful politician to a fruitcake, which makes him lose any credibility he might be fishing for.<br /><br />The plot centers on a shadowy corporate entity controlling much of the industrial and military activity in the world and which seems to be run by a cadre of silent and mysterious automatons.  How they can get into and out of the minds of the protagonists is kept well into the shadows, with little explanation.  Who are they, what are they going to do with all the power that they are accumulating . . are they supposed to be an update of James Bond's SPECTOR?<br /><br />I found nothing worthwhile in this movie.  It only made me want to see the original again, which was a real classic.  Can you imagine trying to re-make Casablanca?  Skip this movie and see the original.</p></body></html>

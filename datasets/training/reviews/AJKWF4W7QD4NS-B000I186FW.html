After seeing his From Hell, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and now this made into films, it's of little wonder why he wants nothing to do with the movie industry.  That aside, the film version of V For Vendetta isn't all bad, and it has some great moments and echos the atmosphere of the comic, but the changes made by the Wachowski Brothers downplays the morality tale that Moore so brilliantly weaved in the 80's when he foresaw a bleak and totalitarian future; one of which is becoming more and more frighteningly real by the day.  Natalie Portman is a combination of worthy and wooden in the role of Evey Hammond, a would be everyman who gets involved with a Guy Fawkes-mask wearing terrorist named V (Hugo Weaving, surprisingly perfectly cast) who plans to strike back against the oppressive British rule.  The sets, design (V's outfit has been wonderfully re-created) and action scenes are all well done, mainly by most of the crew members who worked on the Matrix films, and James McTeigue makes a solid debut as a director; but Moore's message gets lost in all the glossy action.  John Hurt is here as Sutler, the maniacal zealot Chancellor, and while it's good to see both Stephen Rea and Stephen Fry in big roles in a big picture, particularly Rea as the disenchanted inspector who has been assigned to the case.  All in all, Alan Moore's comic may be much more worthy of your time, but the film adaptation of V For Vendetta isn't all bad, which in itself is quite a surprise when you think about who all was behind it.</p></body></html>

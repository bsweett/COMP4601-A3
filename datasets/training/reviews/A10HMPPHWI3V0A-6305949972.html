It's a sad, adventourous and exciting take on the holidays of Halloween & Christmas and all their many wonders. The tale follows Jack the Pumpkin king who is the leader of Halloween town and all of it's citizens, they go to him to help create, each year, a better and more eventful as well as more scary halloween (kind of like Santa & Christmas).<br /><br />When Jack begins to feel that his reign as Pumpkin king is beggining to upset and bore him, he wonders off into a forrest where he comes about several trees with doors ingraved on them, each one with a different symbol that represents each of our holidays. When he stumbles about the christmas tree he gets very excited and is compelled to open the door and see what lies beyond it. What he finds is "Christmas Land" and after the quick but fun number "Whats This?" he loads up all of the intruiging contents of Christmas town and heads back towards halloween town where his curiousity compells him to try his own little christmas. He learns a lesson that he will never forget and soon re-takes his prideful position as pumpkin king.<br /><br />"The Nightmare Before Christmas" has a great origonal score along with some stand out songs. The effects of the movie are astounding and the voices of each charactor couldnt have been any better, its was a classic then and still remains just that<br /><br />Grade: A-</p></body></html>

Boyle showcased his talents as a world-renowned director while creating a work that left cosmopolitan horror-enthusiasts in awe. Aside from the gorgeous cinematography, "28 Days Later" recognized the original intent of zombie-film: to act as social commentary. "White Zombie" (1932) and "Revolt of the Zombie" (1936) set a historical tone for zombie-film which was somewhat lost after Romero's trilogy. But Boyle revived the zombie-film in 2002 ... giving zombie-fans and academics a reason to love zombies again!<br /><br />"28 Weeks Later" has Boyle's fingerprints all over the film (he was, in fact, involved in some of the directing): 1.) Robert Carlyle is cast in a lead role (you may know him as Begbie from Boyle's "Trainspotting," 2.) the soundtrack is a continuation of John Murphy's original score (in fact, I heard variations on the track "The Tunnel" throughout the film,) 3.) it uses Boyle's trademark bridge-shots, and 4.) it employs Boyle's use of a digital format.<br /><br />The film itself is fast-paced, action-heavy, and extraordinarily tense. It is shocking and gripping. Unlike "28 Days Later," the film opens with a "weak" but sympathetic character who is trapped in a heinous lie ... which ultimately leads to the second outbreak. It is an "edge-of-your-seat nail-biter." Quite literally, I never heard one audience member utter a single word through the duration of the work. It offers not a moment for reflection ... it is completely relentless. Perhaps not until the drive home will you decide if you liked the film or not ... or even begin to process it.<br /><br />Now, it must be said that there were some failings. **SPOILERS** Foremost, the recycling of thumb-through-the-eyes assault was less an homage to the original than a needless repetition. Second, while Boyle's "28 Days Later" delivers the horrific tales of Infection through narration (Jim was comatose throughout the spread), this film actually shows the audience the carnage in close-quarters. While some may find this thrilling, many will find it gratuitous. To clarify, when asked to name the bloodiest horror-film of all-time, people inevitably say "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" ... but Hooper's film is a virtually bloodless work. What's the relevance, you ask? On-screen violence tends to be less potent than the violence an audience member IMAGINE. (Which is why Nispel's remake of "TCM" was a critical failure). Moreover, the conclusion can be predicted in the first twenty-minutes of the film which may leave you a little frustrated. (But it's still a great conclusion!!) Finally, while the soundtrack echoes the original film, the attention granted to the first film was lacking here. "28 Days Later" had a cutting-edge appeal: including "God Speed You Black Emperor" and excerpts from Faur&eacute;'s "Requiem" (namely "In Paradisum") on the same soundtrack was brilliant!! I wish there was more diversity in this new work ... instead, with one exception, the soundtrack is a rehash of the instrumental work from "28 Days Later."<br /><br />Still, the attention to detail is fantastic!! Something for which to watch ... note that when Doyle selects a horse on the carousel, he chooses one named "Zed." "Zed," as you know, is the British word for "Z" ... and is often used as a way to refer to zombies (see "Shaun of the Dead" and "World War Z"!!) Just a neat homage to other zombies films and literature!!<br /><br />While the film lacks the character-development of the original, it is ambitious and exciting. Though it can never compare to the original, it will not disappoint!! It is, by all means, a five-star zombie-film!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A beautiful, enchanting, and disturbing film."></head><body><p>Coraline (NOT Caroline) Jones (Fanning) is a very unhappy girl.  Both her parents are far too busy to pay much attention to her; she misses her friends back home; and the young boy who lives next door is a real pest.  The only solace she finds in her new apartment is a strange door that appears to be bricked up...until the sun goes down.  For that's when Caroline gets to go visit her Other Mother, a gracious woman who has all the time in the world for her beloved daughter.  There's just one little hitch: Coraline's Other Mother wants her to stay...forever.<br /><br />"Coraline" is from the mind of Neil Gaiman, so you know it's going to be twisted and disturbing.  And it is; this is one of the more frightening family films ever made.  The imagery is surprisingly horrific; perhaps smaller children won't pick up on the subtleties, but their parents certainly will.  The voice cast, featuring supporting roles by Terri Hatcher, John Hodgman, Keith David, and Ian McShane, helps create an atmosphere of spine-tingling suspense.  The real standout, though, is Dakota Fanning.  In previous film roles, she's been precocious and downright annoying; remember "War of the Worlds"?  No?  Well, sorry for reminding you.  But here she's fantastic; she does what many voice-over artists fail to do: lend her animated character real life, real personality.<br /><br />The overall effect of "Coraline" can be a bit numbing (I only gave the film 4 stars because, near the middle, it sags a bit, once the wonder has worn off).  Maybe it's different in 3D; I haven't jumped on that bandwagon yet.  (By the way, the DVD--and presumably Blu-ray--comes with both the 2D and 3D version of the film, so you can experience the movie both ways if you prefer.)  However, this is certainly a film you should watch if love a good old fashion Grimm's fairy tale.  That's what Gaiman and Selick have created: a modern-day fairy tale, complete with horrors and morals and a talking cat.</p></body></html>

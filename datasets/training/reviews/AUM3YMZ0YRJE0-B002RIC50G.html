<meta name="summary" content="Ghoulishly gruesome, pop psych explanation of a psychopath, but a good story"></head><body><p>I think this is the 2nd best in the series, after the truly first-rate Lambs Silence.  The story is tautly wound:  Hannibal is completely de-humanized as he loses his family to war-time thugs, mixing his budding sexuality  with cannibalistic revenge.  While this is a rather simplistic explanation of the psychopathology of a monster psychopath, it makes for a great viewing experience, so long as you want to witness his horrifically graphic series of atrocities.  The acting is extremely good, to say the least, and the story is coherent, full of incredible images, and tragic.  People expecting realistic psychology, I think, should look to documentaries:  this is entertainment, not science, as if psychology ever could be more scientific than intuitive.<br /><br />Recommended.  Just make sure you have the stomach for it.</p></body></html>

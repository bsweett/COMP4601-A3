<meta name="summary" content="They will do the"March" again on Blu Ray Disc!!!"></head><body><p>This is one great documentary(about Emperor Penguins,as told by Oscar winner Morgan Freeman),it was a surprise hit in theatres and was a hit on DVD!!! It got the Oscar for Best Documentary in 2005 and it deserved it!!! It is now on Blu Ray Disc and it's awseome,and it has the same extras that the DVD release had,just in superior Blu Ray format!!! Blu Ray discs are simply awesome!!! I'm just "Blu" with envy!!! A great film for the whole family,definately worthy of repeat viewings!!! two thumbs up!!! five stars!!! A+</p></body></html>

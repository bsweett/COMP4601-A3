<meta name="summary" content="Second film quite an entertaining departure"></head><body><p>With "The Chronicles of Riddick" director David Twohy takes the same approach as James Cameron did with "Aliens"--change the focus of the story and don't make a sequel as much as an extension of the first film. While the first film borrowed from "Alien" (as much as "Alien" borrowed from "It! The Terror from Beyond Space" or the atmospheric "Planet of the Vampires" and other B-movies), "The Chronicles of Riddick" builds a mythology for Riddick, Jack and Imam. Riddick is very much an anti-hero in the mold of the Man with No Name. Like that character it appears that Riddick develops a conscience--coming closer to his abandoned humanity through his encounters with Jack, Imam and others.<br /><br />Five years have passed since "Pitch Black". Riddick, still on the run, is being hunted by more Mercs for a big payout. One of the people searching for him is Imam one of the survivors who befriended Riddick in "Pitch Black". Imam needs Riddick's help in opposing the Necromongers a race that worships death and destruction. The Lord Marshall (Colm Feore marvelous as always)has plans to conquer the known universe and using those resources to take his followers to the Underverse a mysterious place that changes the essential nature of humanity in a dark way.<br /><br />Imam knows the legend that only a Furion may defeat the Lord Marshall. He hopes that Riddick will help the people of his adopted world fight back and survive the coming attack. Urged on by one of the Elementals (Judi Dench), Riddick considers their offer and rejects it. He just wants to get on with his life. As in "Pitch Black" Riddick gets drawn into the conflict because those that he learns to care about are threatened by the Necromongers. When the Lord Marshall discovers Riddick's identity he tries to have him killed when he won't serve him.<br /><br />Now Riddick must find Jack (Alexa Davalos)now known as Kyra who has gone to a prison planet in search of him, save her and get revenge for the killing of those he cares about.<br /><br />A marvelous space opera, Twohy has crafted a suspenseful film that manages to channel the best elements of the Spagetti Westerns, 50's science fiction space operas like "This Island Earth", science fiction pulp stories from the 40's and 50's and has merged them into an entertaining larger than life story that provides the epic scope of a "Lord of the Rings" within a space opera context. It's a fun movie that has great action, stunts and optical effects. It's not meant to be deep although, like Sergio Leone's westerns, there's more here than meets the eye and dismissing it out of hand is unfair.<br /><br />The "Unrated Director's Cut" is the better of the two versions. it has fifteen minutes of additional footage, character development and background on Riddick's people and what happened to them. While the picture occasionally jumps when segueing from the theatrical cut to the "Director's Cut" (due to cuts made to the negative), it's not disruptive enough to disturb the story. Twohy has proven himself an adept director with supernatural thrillers ("Below")and other science fiction thrillers ("The Arrival") to his credit. He creates a compelete world for Riddick that was lacking in the suspense thriller "Pitch Black". It's a much bigger film with a much different type of story but, essentially, the same character at its core.<br /><br />The film sports an outstanding high definition transfer. There's also an audio commentary track full of fascinating tid bits featuring Karl Urban (also from "The Lord of the Rings" and "The Bourne Supremacy" as well as a deadringer for a young David Gilmour of Pink Floyd fame), Alexa Davalos ("Jack" or "Kyra") and director Twohy. It's full of interesting trivia about the genesis of the project through the end of production. There's also quite a bit of discussion on the background of characters, changes to the script prior to production and some of the physical challenges the actors and director faced during production.<br /><br />The featurettes include "Toombs Chase Logs" (he's one of the Mercs aka Mercenary bounty hunters hunting Riddick), a virtual guide that pulls in viewers into Riddick's world from the various perspectives of the characters. "Riddick Insider Facts on Demand" provides scene specific trivia about various parts of the film and the characters. "Riddick's World" features Vin Diesel on a tour behind-the-scenes along with 360 degree virtual glimpse at the various sets from the film.<br /><br />A marvelous and underrated space opera adventure, "The Chronicles of Riddick" is quite a different film from "Pitch Black" and the anime prequel. The fact that Twohy wasn't willing to just repeat himself and came up with new and challenging material is to his credit. It's also why the film is as solid an action adventure saga as it is. Give "The Chronicles of Riddick" a chance and disregard the mainstream critics. You won't be sorry you did.</p></body></html>

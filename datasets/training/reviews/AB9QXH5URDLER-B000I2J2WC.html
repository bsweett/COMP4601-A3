<meta name="summary" content="The Long-Awaited Movie is Out, And I Liked It"></head><body><p>The Da Vinci Code opened amid a flurry of reviews, but most of the reviews were made before people even saw the movie!  I am only one person, but I actually DID watch the movie, and here are some of my thoughts.<br /><br />Q. Does it vilify the Catholic Church and the Opus Dei?<br /><br />A. Yes, if I were Catholic I would not like this movie.  Churches seem to be prime targets for attack these days.  Perhaps Christianity is one of the few scape goats left that can be used for villains without raising too much of a backlash.  Although I think this is changing and Ron Howard and Tom Hanks toned down the movie to the point that it is almost acceptable.  Most viewers will see this as more fantasy than an attack on the Catholic Church.<br /><br />Q. Is this movie Christian?<br /><br />A. No, it presents paganism as a viable belief system opposed to Christianity.  It presents Christianity as a source of evil in the world.<br /><br />Q. Is it historical?<br /><br />A. Hard to answer, it does contain historical references.  Some are true, some are debatable, and some have no scholarly basis at all.<br /><br />Q. Is it a danger to Christianity?<br /><br />A. No, the movie doesn't carry the same atmosphere of realism that the book carries.<br /><br />Q. Is it interesting?<br /><br />A. Yes, I went with several other people who had not read the book.  They all liked it and could follow the story line.  The monk, Silas, does an excellent part with his role.  Several of the other characters are well acted.  The movie is a little slow compared to the book, but keeps moving.<br /><br />My Final Analysis:<br /><br />This is not as good as some say and not as bad as others say.  It is a movie.  When all is said and done, that is how it will be perceived.  It is an excellent conversation starter.</p></body></html>

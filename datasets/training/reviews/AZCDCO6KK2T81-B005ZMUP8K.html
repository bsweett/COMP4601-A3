<meta name="summary" content="Lightning Can Strike Twice!"></head><body><p>As I said in Pirates 1, there isn't much one can add to the discussion of these Pirate films at this point and with not having reviewed them before and after a weekend of watching Pirates 1 and 2 in anticipation of 3 next week, I thought it time to write up something on this sequel.<br /><br />I sincerely doubted that the team that gave us Pirates 1 could possibly top themselves with Pirates 2, but it appears that if they didn't top themselves, they at least succeeded with a film that, for the most part, is as equally good and entertaining as the first.  Oh, how rare that is in "sequelville."<br /><br />Everything I thought was great about the first is present in the second, except that this film is a bit less original, but still enormously clever.  It does what a sequel should do in that it gives us more of what we liked in the original film, has the storyline continue in some digestible manner and not just rehash the previous film, and has our characters not only be as familar as they were in the first film, but grow in the sequel as well.  Pirates 2 does all this and with great gusto and skill.  The special effects are different rather than better, but they are just as enjoyable and don't detract from the story or attempt to make up for poor writing. Gore Verbinski, the director, continues to captain this fleet of films with confidence and clear direction.  Hans Zimmer's music which although repetitive in this film is very welcomed as it really helps to define the Pirate films.  It's one of the best scores to a series of films since Indiana Jones.  Lastly, you have to love how this team found another great entrance for Depp.  I thought the first was the best I had ever since for a leading man and this one has to be the second.  Kudos to the writers for their cleverness and creativity there!<br /><br />Lightning can strike twice and boy I'm praying that it can three times.  I have never looked this forward to sequels before and I doubt I ever will again.  I'm good for more sequels and even prequels from this team.</p></body></html>

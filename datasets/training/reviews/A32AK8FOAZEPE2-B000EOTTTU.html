<meta name="summary" content="the director of this movie should be forced into early retirement."></head><body><p>what a waste of production budget. the director and the screenplay writer(s) should be banned from directing and writing anything related to movie industry. it's so weird to watch three persons (one woman and two guys kept blabbering as some kinda voice in the head: 'who am i? what is love?....' i simply could not believe any movie would be shot in this way with 3 voice-overs. so there's a new trend to use narrators blabbing beside the director's commentary? do we really need that? this director who directed that drive-me-nuts 'a thin red line' now did it again! wake up, man, this is not a cool way to direct a panned-out movie. so tiresome and so pretentious, man. and 'breathtakingly beautiful'? 'two thumbs up'? give me a break.</p></body></html>

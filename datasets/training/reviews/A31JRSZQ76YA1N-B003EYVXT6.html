Well, we'll never quite know ~ until the species reveals itself ....<br />Remember the old petri-dishes of the 1950ties ....?<br /><br />ANYHOW, this is an utterly charming movie, quite unusual and highly sophisticated .... appeal?  Those with very open minds ..... "Oh, it could just never happen...".<br /><br />The brilliantly beautiful creation [female to male - somehow that does make utter sense] is quite awesome - and the superior intelligence it displays.  Vocals?  Doesn't really need them - too primitive.<br /><br />For those who really enjoy something somewhat traditional with very unusual and stimulating "changes" ~ THIS ONE'S FOR YOU.<br /><br />NOW ~ there must be a sequel or two or more ......very much a keeper and endearing in its charm.<br /><br />Performances?  Quite superior ~ especially the quite adorable creation.<br /><br />[THE DESIGN?  Dren's appearance is seemingly based on Adam's 1st wife - Lillith/Ishtar/Astarte ~ check the few remaining images for details ~ COOL!]</p></body></html>

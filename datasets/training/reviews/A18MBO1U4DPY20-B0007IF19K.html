<meta name="summary" content="RAY"></head><body><p>At Twenty, I look back at my life and I see my life in pictures and more pictures. Ray Charles in contrast sees/saw only that part of his life where he could dream of something real and worth holding onto in pictures.Sadly, it takes him back to the deepest wound he ever suffered.The fact that the story and screenplay on this film made me feel Jamie Foxx is the real Ray Charles is alone for me to rank it high.<br /><br />Ray Charles was a man of gritty belief in himself but somehow or somewhere he would run back into those days where he could see as a child.The haunt and absolute feeling of worthlessness he felt never really escaped him. What I gained from this film is that childhood memories last a lifetime but it's only the superhuman who get over those.Pardon my lack of faith in humanity.<br /><br />There were two scenes that made me cry and not surprisingly both were from his sorrowful past.What was however quite amazing about Ray Charles was the lack of any self pity in him. It were the words of his mother that kept him going.<br /><br />Please note, this film is not for short attention span dilletes. It's not for those seeking Spidermans preventing trains from colliding and neither for those who wish to have a good time. It's one I'd recommend mostly to those who wish to look into another person's life. Jamie Foxx has gained a mountain load of appreciation for this role and deservedly so.<br /><br />I think I'm gonna go watch more movies based on people's lives.I wouldn't consider buying Ray simply because it's not something I'd like to watch again.<br /><br />Cheers & a Ray Charle smile..</p></body></html>

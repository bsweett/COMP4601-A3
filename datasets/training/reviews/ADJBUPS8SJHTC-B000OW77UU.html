<meta name="summary" content="Inspirational, Moving, Emotional"></head><body><p>I went to see this movie on my birthday, and I tell you, the ending made me cry; The sheer energy of Will Smith just going out there to the games with the President on just nerve, and then going to work and possibly not being able to have a job at the end of that internship was just nothing but inspirational.Then when they are homeless and on just raw imagination, Will Smith tells his son that they are living in the dinosaur age, That was pure genius.I felt so bad when he lost his toy while they were trying to catch the bus. I won't lie but I cried at the end; I was really rooting for him big time. the son was darn good; he was truly good and I am sorry that Will didn't win the award though this year the award for Best Actor was pretty challenging; Nevertheless, the film is worth the price of admission and more and good for those times when you feel your on your last leg.</p></body></html>

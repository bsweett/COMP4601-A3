<meta name="summary" content="Costner, Hurt and story are good but Moore and Cook add little"></head><body><p>3.4 stars<br /><br />Not bad, but it could have been a lot better, mainly with others doing Moore's and Cook's roles. Neither is very convincing. Costner is good and Hurt is very good, however, and the basic story is pretty interesting. Looks good on blu-ray but hardly mind-blowing.<br /><br />I would have liked more Hurt and that side of the story; the devil on the shoulder has rarely been done as well as this. Cook is no great dramatic actor, and Moore's part is pretty badly written and she's no Kate Hepburn, so they slow things down, and all in all it's worth watching mainly for Hurt and Costner.<br /><br />Not a classic, but a decent enough thriller.</p></body></html>

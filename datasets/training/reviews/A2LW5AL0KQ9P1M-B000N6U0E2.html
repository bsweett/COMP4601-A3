Sooo ...<br /><br />Ignore the one and two-star ratings which claim this film is "depressing." Foremost, the film is uplifting ... it is (forgive the cliche) a film which clearly illustrates the "triumph of the human spirit." It would have been a gross-misstep to "downplay" Gardner's challenges and hardships: this is what makes the ending as powerful as it is. Moreover, this film underscores that which is all-too-overlooked in our society: the unconditional love of a father for his child. Hollywood loves mothers, but often vilifies fathers ... it is refreshing to see a turn in the trend. And, that Will Smith's own son plays his on-screen son ... it is a tribute to fathers and sons everywhere.<br /><br />The quality of the film itself is worthy of a four or five-star rating. The cinematography, the soundtrack, the acting (watch for a cameo by the real Chris Gardner at the film's conclusion), and the film-extras: all are near immaculate. Hopefully, this will help allay the fears that the one and two-star ratings may have instilled. And, also allow me to say, that I am not a fan of mainstream film ... but I did enjoy this honest portrait of an incredible man.<br /><br />When you purchase this film, be certain to watch the film-extra "The Man Behind the Movie: A Conversation with Chris Gardner." Though the feature-film is entirely self-contained (you do not need this documentary-short to explain any aspect of the film), it is a treat to see the real-life Chris Gardner and glean some insight into this man's commitment to attaining the "American Dream" for his son (which was still possible in '81).<br /><br />For a bit of fun, also check-out the extra "Inside the Rubik's Cube." You will be stunned to see what a cult-phenomenon this "toy" remains even today!!<br /><br />Watch this film if you have an interest in "triumph over adversity," 1980's culture, or the oft-maligned, very-necessary role of fathers in our life.<br /><br />Suggested Reading: Gardner, Chris.

<meta name="summary" content="A Movie That Comes Only Once in a Lifetime!"></head><body><p>The Nightmare Before Christmas. I've grown up with the movie. Back in '93 when I was very young I first saw it. I was too young to complete a complex thought about the film but now I am. I've seen the movie dozens of times between then a now and have been trying to get the DVD for a while now and finally got it recently. Watching the deleted scenes and photos were fun because I got to know what it was like to make the movie and what they did. The movie has been critcally praised and all I've heard were good things from the people who've seen it.<p>The film starts by seeing that all of the holiday's have there own town. Creatures and people representing people heard around that holiday.(Monsters on Halloween,Elfs on Christmas etc)They celebrate that holiday when the time comes and in the woods there are trees with the doors to those places. The story starts in Halloweentown where they are celebrating Halloween. Jack Skellington who is the one loved by most and is the most scariest of all the creatures there. When Halloween ends we learn that Jack has been depressed because it's always the same every year. He ends up walking into the place where all the holidays intersect. He walks into Christmastown and loves everything there. No monsters,no ghouls,no horror. Just happiness and people being jolly. Back at home he ponders about what the meaning of Christmas is only to come up with one solution......to make there own Christmas. Jack and the crew in Halloweentown all make toys they think are beautiful and fun but are really horrible and scary. Jack is warned from his friend Sally who loves his dearly to not go on with it but Jack disagrees. He needs something new to end his Halloween cycle. Jacks big misake is when he sends Halloweentown's finest trick or treaters Lock Shock and Barrel to go and get Santa Clause. The problem is caused when they give him to Oogie Boogie(Bogeyman)and Boogie is a very very evil Halloweentown citizen. Can Christmas be saved?<p>With excellant music and songs by composer Danny Elfman(Spiderman,Planet of the Apes,Novocaines Theme)Great songs include "This is Halloween","Jack's Lament","Sally's Songs","Jack's Obession",and "Poor Jack".<p>Some scenes may be a little scary to some young kids but The Nightmare Before Christmas has fun for everybody...adults and kids alike. A movie that will always be loved and will always be great.<p>ENJOY!</p></body></html>

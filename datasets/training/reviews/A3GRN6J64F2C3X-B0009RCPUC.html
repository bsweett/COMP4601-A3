<meta name="summary" content="A human Hitler is a scarier Hitler"></head><body><p>"Downfall" is an intelligent, engrossing drama, and one that is sure to be a treat for history buffs, though "treat" might not be the right word in light of the grim proceedings on display.<br /><br />There's really not much else I can add to the excellent customer reviews and comments here on Amazon, so I'll just say this: I didn't have any problem at all with Hitler being portrayed with a touch more humanity in this production than in many previous dramatizations of his life.  Showing Hitler being patient with his nervous secretary or having a quiet moment with his mistress or (to use the old cliche) being nice to his dog, doesn't mean the film makers are making excuses for Hitler or softening him.  Rather, such moments do just the opposite: they warn us that the horror of Hitler could rise up again in another human being who may at first glance seem like a regular person.<br /><br />Portraying Hitler in a one-note lunatic fashion- as he's been portrayed often in the past- makes him less real and more like a cartoon villain that only achieved power as a fluke, and that's a dangerous idea.  No, I think the film makers made the right decision in making Hitler seem, at least somewhat, like a regular person.  And, besides, for those who prefer to see the crazy, ranting Hitler, not to worry: there's plenty of that here, too.<br /><br />Now, whether the film makers gave a free pass to many of Hitler's supporters, many of whom are portrayed in the film as simply naive or just too weak or scared to resist, I don't know.  Certainly the film didn't give such a pass to everyone surrounding the man in the film.  Hitler is by no means the only figure in the film who radiates hate and evil.<br /><br />In the final analysis, the important service this harrowing, often claustrophobic film provides surely outweighs any shortcomings it might have.  Also worth your time is the almost hour-long "making of" documentary that's also on the DVD.  It explores in detail many of the themes and topics discussed in these Amazon reviews, in particular why the actors felt it important to portray the historical figures as the figures likely saw themselves and not as they're seen today; and what the German film makers wanted to accomplish in making a film about Hitler at all.<br /><br />This is a top-notch film, and a top-notch DVD, all around.</p></body></html>

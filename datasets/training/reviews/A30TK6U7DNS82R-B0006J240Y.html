The only thing I could figure out was that both Julianne Moore and Dominic West were playing characters who could afford to let their children go on special plane flights for kids on QuestAir, but you don't have to be a millionaire to go on a plane, and these people are living in these fantastic apartments that are easily as big as plane hangars.  They're all gloomy too, well, that figures.  It's like GREY GARDENS without the occasional musical numbers.<br /><br />How many times does Julianne Moore have to introduce herself with the catchy mnemomyic, "I'm Telly Paretta"?  Someone, perhaps the hard-working psychiatrist played by Gary Sinise, should have asked her why her mom and dad named her after TV's KOJAK and saved himself months and months of analytical discovery.  Sinise is the only actor who could have played this part, Dr. Muntz, who browbeats the police into letting him accompany them at all times for he must be there when they recapture Telly otherwise she'll suffer a psychotic break.  Yeah, like the police would really pay attention to this worry wart.  And yet the plot is constructed so that this has to happen.  I also enjoyed the part where Telly, adopting the pleasant guise of a personal assistant, tricks an auditor into giving up a suspect's home address: "165 Colony Road, Long Island."  Gee, that'll be easy to find!  Didn't they want to name a real town?<br /><br />Anyhow I loved the movie and couldn't bear to see it end.  I bought it for my own DVD collection and probably will see it over and over, it will help me with my own feelings of anxiety and inadequacy about not having kids.  You know how sometimes one wakes up feeling so spacey that, if Anthony Edwards told me I had had a miscarriage and didn't really have any children at all, I'd believe him, for he has such an innocent face and it's so great he got a part in a major studio movie again after being stigmatized by his "Mark Green" role in ER for for many years during which time he was graylisted by Hollywood and went completely, utterly, bald like Otto Preminger.</p></body></html>

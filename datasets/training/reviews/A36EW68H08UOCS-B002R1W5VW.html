<meta name="summary" content="Nicolas Cage knocks our socks off again"></head><body><p>Nicolas Cage as Roy Waller gives the most entertaining performance of a person suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder since Jack Nicholson in &quot;As Good As It Gets&quot;.  Cage is nearly paralyzed by his condition, in particular when he is out of his medication.  The early scenes establish his condition and his occupation as a con artist, and there is a steller sequence which begins when he clumsily dumps his medications into kitchen sink and commences a series of panicked phone calls to get refills after hours.  There are several hilarious scenes between Cage and Bruce Altman as Roy's Psychiatrist.<p>Sam Rockwell as Roy's con-man partner Frank Mercer gives another performance that signals his emergence as an American A-list actor. Alison Lohman is very appealing as the daughter Roy never met.<p>The first act of the film introduces these three characters and the second develops Roy's relationship with his daughter.<p>The third act builds around an elaborate con that the three of them have cooked up, and by the end of the film you see that the con worked exactly as one of them planned.  I don't plan to give any twists away but I will say expect some - twists that is.<p>Ridley Scott directs and adds another jewel to a resume that already sparkles with &quot;Alien&quot;, &quot;Thelma and Louise&quot;, &quot;Blackhawk Down&quot;, &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;Gladiator&quot;.</p></body></html>

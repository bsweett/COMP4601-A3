<meta name="summary" content="Our Future -- What Is A Court Of Law?"></head><body><p>Just returned from watching this jam-packed action movie and was completely enthralled with the whole thing, not one minute of the 2.5 hrs. was boring -- nothing.  Of course, the stars Ewan MacGregor and Scarlett Johansson carried this movie from beginning to end; they were marvelous, and so good-looking.<br /><br />There is way too much in this movie to go into detail.  You've just got to see it and enjoy being transported to the future of our world via Amerithiotech, which at first seems to be a super modernistic approach to longevity and healthcare.  But producing clones who can live as real people is beyond the stretch of my imagination.  "Grow old along with me; the best is yet to be --- the last of life, for which the first was made, our times are in His hand." Robert Browning.<br /><br />They were grown in symbiolic wombs (water bags) and evolve into adult size doubles of the original for organ replacement or even skin grafts, allowing the sponsors to live sixty to seventy years longer -- at the cost of the clone.  One poor mother-to-be is used to produce an adopted baby serving as surrogate mother andis thusly euthenized.  She never gets to hold 'her' baby, but the real parents take 'their' baby home.  "Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies."<br /><br />The Sarah Jordon clone gets to see her 'son' on the picture phone out in L. A.  That place is truly fantastic with antennea on all the buildings like the batman building in Nashville. The L. A. Metro undergraound garage looks exactly like the stage portal in the Tennessee Theatre here.<br /><br />There was a real Tom Lincoln and the Scotland billionnaire takes the place of Lincoln 6 Echo in his V12 08 Caddy like an MG, only bigger.  There is no island, it is an underground bunker out in the desert of California along Route 39W.  This is the original body farm, to the higgest bidder.  Even the President of the United States has a clone just waiting.  The good actor who was so perfect in "The Green Mile" played Starkweather whose liver was taken -- after a fight for his life.<br /><br />In a way, this was a lot like the movie, "NO Escape," with the beautiful Rock of Gilbratar as an entranceway along the water in the dreams of Echo.  They encounter a rattlesnake, a truly scary scene in the long, long movie.  This was considered to be the HOly Grail of Science, but was more like the concentration camps in Germany with the attempted mass extinction of the defective clones.  The chicanery, wits, bravery and ability to think made these two special when they came out of Silo 3 to see the beautiful Earth for the first time.<br /><br />The chase across the bridge was 'something to see.'  And surviving the fall of the Big "R" sign from seventy stories high was a trip as they were caught in the net.  The main theme is that people will do anything to survive and to live longer.  The music at the end matched the fast action and left you feeling "Hey, this is the best movie I've seen in a long time."</p></body></html>

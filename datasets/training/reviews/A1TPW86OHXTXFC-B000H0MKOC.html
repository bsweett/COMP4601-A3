Defending the defenseless, protecting the disenfranchised corporations that have been abandoned by their very own consumers: the logger, the sweatshop foreman, the oil driller, the land mine developer, the baby seal poacher...<br />Polly Bailey: Baby seal poacher?<br /><br />Dr Spin meets Dr Alcohol and Dr Gun, three spin doctors, 'MOD Squad' (Merchants of Death), who meet weekly to discuss their woes, a support group of sorts.  Aaron Eckhart as Nick Naylor is the Dr of Nicotine, spinning the web for his company. He is good at what he does, and what he does is talk> He can spin anything. "It's really about the Age of Spin, where with the right TV spokesperson even Adolph Hitler might come off as a misunderstood individual."  Christopher Buckley wrote the novel, and irony outdoes irony in this flick. What greater good for mankind than to lobby for the cigarette industry, of which up to 1200 Americans die daily.<br /><br />The supporting cast is fabulous. Kim Dickens is his ex-wife, who is trying to protect their son, played by Cameron Bright, from the evils of Dr Spin. Nick Naylor is led by something other than common sense when he takes up with a writer/reporter, Katie Holmes. He spills his secrets which are duly reported. Nick's boss, Robert Duvall, wants him to go to Hollywood and engage the Hollywood crowd in smoking in the movies for big money. He meets 'The Marlboro Man' and soon the man has taken his money. Nick takes his son to Hollywood and does his job. He meets super agent Rob Lowe, who is very funny in this movie and disguised as an Asian soothsayer. All the while Nick is trying to show his son that you can do this kind of job and maintains a semblance of order. A kidnapping and court appearance showcase Nick Naylor's expertise. Aaron Eckhart is a smooth charming character and delivers this film. In the end, however, Nick Naylor pays the right price.<br /><br />"Another plus: Ethics never get in the way of the jokes. Both sides of the political fence will feel royally skewered. All that's lacking is a warning from the Surgeon General: This film will make you laugh till it hurts." Peter Travers<br /><br />This is a laugh out loud film if you are rooting for Nick Naylor. The tobacco business does not take the fall, all corporations and spin misters are involved.  Highly recommended. prisrob 11/26.06</p></body></html>

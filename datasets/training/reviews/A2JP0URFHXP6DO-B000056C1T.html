<meta name="summary" content="A BRAVEHEART IN COLONIAL TIMES"></head><body><p>The patriot basically is a knock-off of &quot;Braveheart&quot; in buckskin vests and powdered wigs, but that doesn't seem to bother Mel Gibson, who won an Oscar for directing that film and stars in this one as another tread-upon colonial who takes up arms against England for his nation's freedom. <p>A hero of the French and Indian War who has since pledged to raise his children as a pacifist plantation farmer in South Carolina.  He takes up arms against the British after one of his sons is killed in cold blood.<p>Much like Braveheart, Gibson becomes a one-man army, leading a band of colonialist against the Red Coats.<p>Still, for all its adherence to formula, &quot;The Patriot&quot; is certainly handsome and effectively rousing in small ways, like the scenes in which Martin smelts his dead son's toy soldiers into musket balls, or when he rallies farmers and villagers to arms, resulting in a motley militia of &quot;colorful&quot; roughnecks from central casting. <p>Not a bad movie, but as with Braveheart, not high in historical accuracy and he Gibson isn't surrounded by nearly the stellar cast of that movie.</p></body></html>

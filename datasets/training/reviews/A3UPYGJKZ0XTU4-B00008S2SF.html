<meta name="summary" content="Creative Action and Stunning Bond Girls."></head><body><p>While on a mission in North Korea, James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) is betrayed by an unknown informant and imprisoned there. When he is released in exchange for a North Korean agent, he is suspected by his own intelligence service of having divulged sensitive information, and his "00" status is rescinded. Bond sets out to find the person who betrayed him by way of finding the North Korean terrorist who was traded for him. His search leads him to Gustav Graves (Toby Stevens), a publicity crazed diamond magnate whose gemstones are of suspect origin. Following the same trail is a beautiful American agent named Jinx (Halle Barry). Graves invites all the relevant parties to his Ice Palace in Iceland for the grand unveiling of "Icarus", a new satellite technology which will allow the sun's light to be focused anywhere on Earth at any time. James Bond and Jinx must discover Grave's true identity and purpose, find the mole who has compromised their agencies' security, and prevent Icarus from being used as a weapon of mass destruction.<br /><br />"Die Another Day" celebrates the 40th anniversary of James Bond films by placing little references to Bond history in the movie: Jinx' first appearance closely resembles that of Ursula Andress in "Dr. No". Some of Bond's old gadgets reappear in Q's storage room. And I'm sure there were a lot of references that I missed., but this homage to past Bonds is neither fulfilling nor distracting. "Die Another Day" does quite well on its own and joins the list of thoroughly entertaining Brosnan Bonds, carrying on the somewhat modernized traditions of this great franchise. The action sequences are creative, original and entertaining. The "Bond girls" are actually very pretty. Halle Barry is a pleasure to watch as the plucky Jinx. And Rosamund Pike does a nice Ice Princess as Gustav Grave's publicist. Carrying on a long tradition, there are a lot of new half-plausible, half-science fiction technologies that look really neat, anyway. "Die Another Day" is a special effects-driven movie, in contrast to Sean Connery's more character-driven Bonds. But, ironically, Pierce Brosnan's modern Bond is less of a super hero and more of a man than Connery's. This is particularly evident in "Die Another Day". We see Bond's vunerability...which he then uses his charming personality, skill and great determination to overcome. A solid, well-paced, entertaining Bond.</p></body></html>

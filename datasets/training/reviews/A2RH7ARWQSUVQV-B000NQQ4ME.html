Gibson's people made a successful effort at demonstrating a civilization totally alien from our own.  I loved the strange women, almost aliens from outer space.  I also like the slave raid.  For thousands of years inhabitants of the Americas experienced similar raids by war parties from the "civilized" nations on the continent.<br /><br />The slaving scene, for those who wish to look "under the covers", is the history of civilization in general.  Up until only a couple of centuries ago, slavery was simply a given and was not regarded as wrong.  The difference in MesoAmerica was that many of the captives, rather than being used for slave labor, went to fattening pens and to heart sacrifice.<br /><br />I liked the relationship between the slave captain and his son when he tells him after the successful slave capture.  "Your doing a great job, boy.  I'm proud of you."  Wonderful, really, and all so very human.  The final scene was great.  The warring Indians look out to sea and watch strange men with helmets and breastplates rowing into shore.  It's the Apocalypse.  The world WILL change.  Ironically, this film ends up almost exactly where my two novels--"Skull Rack" and "Hummingbird God"--start...the glorious, terrible Conquest of Mexico.<br /><br />I thought the chase scene, although exciting, was a little too much "Last of the Mohicans."  It was good in "Mohicans" but once is enough.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite, author of novels on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico, "Skull Rack" and "Hummingbird God"</p></body></html>

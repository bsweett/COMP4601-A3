But I suspect that is not really the real problem of `Eragon.' You should remember that George Lucas actually borrowed from Kurosawa's masterpiece `Hidden Fortress' when he wrote the story of the Princess, the Warriors, and two comic relief. The difference is that Lucas created the characters that almost instantly became cultural icons every one can relate to - Who can forget the `conversations' of R2-D2 and C-3PO?<br /><br />`Eragon' has promising start when we are introduced to the dragon named Saphira. Rachel Weisz effectively provides the voice of this newly-born dragon, who quickly grows to be much wiser than its `rider' Eragon (Edward Speleers), young farm boy who happened to discover the dragon's egg. The egg was in fact stolen from King Galbatorix (scenery-chewing John Malkovich) who orders Durza (Robert Carlyle) to take it back no matter what it takes.<br /><br />Well, I think this is a pretty good story. I don't see originality here. but not that bad. However, director Stefen Fangmeier (formerly visual effects supervisor for `Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events' and others) misses every opportunity to let us know the film's characters on the screen. If the film's story says the egg was stolen from the evil king, presenting a bit more actions (and information) about Arya (Sienna Guillory) would not hurt. It would give us more vivid pictures of the fantasy world by showing more of this beautiful fighter, but the film just forgets it. Or how about Eragon's mentor named Brom (Jeremy Irons) who says he knows much about dragons and dragon riders? I do not doubt his mumbling words, but he could have used and showed better tricks than just words and sword-fighting with wood sticks to prove his knowledge.<br /><br />The only thing we are sure of is that the young hero is a good boy but still immature, even arrogant sometimes. That's OK as long as his motives are reasonable and consistent. Apparently the director didn't think that way. While watching, we are often at a loss as to the mission or the purpose of his journey, having few clues as to what he realy wants to (or has to) do. Magic spells are cast all too sudden, rather haphazardly. Geography of the world is not clear, and worst of all it seems as if Eragon himself is causing some of the troubles (and their serious consequences). But we are required to take side of him while he doesn't know what he is doing.<br /><br />CGI of the film is nothing great, if not bad. The images of the flying dragon(s) are good, but its facial expressions need improvement. The lack of more convincing dragon's face may be forgiven in other films, but not in this where the relation between the dragon and the dragon rider plays a significant role in the plot.<br /><br />I expected more from `Eragon' because I like films about fantasy world. Yes, while watching Jeremy Irons in ragged coat, I was reminded of Obi-Wan and Jedi Master, but that didn't bother me a lot. Rather, it was the lack of the force and originality that really disappointed me.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good Ideas & Action, But Not What It Could Have Been"></head><body><p>Going for a vastly more grand scale than either "Pitch Black" or "Dark Fury". "Chronicles Of Riddick" hinges the fate of the universe on resisting the advances of a huge militaristic/twisted religious sect called the Necromongers who are overrunning entire planets, with a survivor from the first film, now politically influential, attempting to recruit Riddick to help with the battle.  Some have complained of a relative lack of story here; Ill take the opposite track and submit that there's a LOT of story, it just gets swamped by the constant rocket-fast pace.  I mean, what we have here is a story that should have been about 4-and-a-half hours, but running somewhere around two hours (and to think that the theatrical movie was actually 16 minutes shorter than the DVD!) it's got more angles packed in more tightly than "Star Wars Episode 1", to the point where the story actually does get in danger of disappearing from sight.  This is one you're really going to have to pay attention to in order to make sense of.  It's packed with some of the best and most dynamic action scenes ever (although sometimes of tenuous believability), but if the characters and multiple plotlines had been given proper screentime to develop, not only would they themselves have added to the movie but the action scenes themselves would have been more potent.  The tenuous believability is also a hampering effect at times.  Occasionally the movie straddles (thankfully briefly) the line of camp, which was definately Not the case with the first two.  It's like it's so big it just got away from the filmmakers a couple of times there.<br /><br />  This isn't a bad movie by any means though, it's just not as great as it should have been.  If giving it three stars seems like it's a putdown it's not; when stuck between giving a movie 3 or 4 stars I think what I'd give it on a tenpoint scale (an extremely inexact science, because I think movies are hard to quantify with a numerical value) and this is a good 6.5 to 7.  Some reviewers I've noticed (not a criticism, just an observation) will say a movie is pretty terrible and then still give it 3 or even 4 stars; I guess it all depends on how good you think an 'average' movie is what would be signified by each rating.  In my view, based on everything I've seen in my life from the worst to the best, the 'average' movie (2.5 stars or 5 Of 10) is still pretty watchable, and I place "Chronicles Of Riddick" well above average. It's just not as great as it could have been, or as great as "Pitch Black" or "Dark Fury".<br /><br />  I hope there's a sequel (before this came out I think I heard some where they wanted to do Three more after this) because, without giving anything away, it's wide open for sequelization, (having had a terrific twist ending that opens u a universe of possibilities) and could build on the strengths of all the films so far, including this one, and sidestep the slips in this one, perhaps with a longer running time.  If it's not financially feasible to do another mega-budget live-action one like this there are a number of less expensive routes they could take: original novels; animated features (actually I want more Dark Fury-type animated entries regardless); comic books; etc.  The series is too good to end on a slightly off-kilter note.</p></body></html>

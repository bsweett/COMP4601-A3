Mark Wahlberg is a school-teacher caught in the middle of the most boring "apocalyptic" movie ever filmed. It seems that mother nature has finally had enough of the terrible human race, and has decided to gas us all w/ mind-altering suicide toxin! Now, this may sound interesting, and perhaps in the right hands it would be, but trust me on this one. It ain't! All we get are various groups of over-actors, meandering about, then running from the wind (that's where the toxin is doncha know)! There is no tension or suspense, and certainly no horror. It's as if someone had an interesting dream, and made a movie out of it as soon as they woke up, without taking the time to work out any of the important details. I rarely experience a bomb of this thudding magnitude! The fact that this is a "professional", hollywood production only adds to the overall misery, since this means that it was expensive to make as well! Dear Lord, this one's monumentally awful...</p></body></html>

Norton and Giamatti are terrific, with fine supporting work by their castmates.  The story involves the childhood forbidden love between a noble girl and a peasant boy.  After they are discovered, he disappears and travels the world learning magic and illusion.  He returns 15 years later to find her engaged to the prince, but very unhappy.  The prince is a mean petty man, and Giamatti is his man.  It is an interesting battle of wills between the prince and Norton with Giamatti caught between.  The ending is a big twist and reveal.  I wasn't completely suprised, but I did enjoy it.  A great little film and worth getting.</p></body></html>

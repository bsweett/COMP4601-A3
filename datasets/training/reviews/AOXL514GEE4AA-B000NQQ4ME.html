<meta name="summary" content="I AM JAGUAR PAW! Blu ray review!"></head><body><p>I am not going to get to deep into the story. There are a 1000 reviews here and they are extremely positive. Those that aren't focus on the historical innaccuracies. Let's be honest here...if you want to watch a historical documentary...please turn to the HISTORY CHANNEL! Otherwise, this is an adventure set 600 years towards the end of the Mayan civilization. The main character is a young man named Jaguar Paw. He is a fierce hunter, loving husband and father whose world is destroyed when his  village is attacked by Mayans. Before his capture, he hides his wife and son in a well. Against all odds he must flee his captors and return to his family before the rains come! What ensues is nothing short of an adrenaline rush! A great movie!<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: One word: WOW! This is gorgeous! The colors explode and fill the screen! Lush green jungles, roaring fires, and solar eclipses! This is a visual joy! DEMO DISC! The audio is outstanding as well. All special features from the DVD are carried over. FINAL VERDICT: UPGRADE! A MUST OWN!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Spacey Saves the Film!"></head><body><p>I love Kevin Spacey. He'e made some pretty great movies like "American Beauty," and "The Life of David Gale." Now he's back, in front of, and in back of the camera in "Beyond the Sea," which is the life story of Bobby Darrin. Alot of biography movies have been coming out this year, and most of them about music. There was the Ray Charles movie, "Ray," the Cole Porter movie, "De-Lovely," and it wasn't about music, but the Howard Hughes movie "The Aviator." I have to say that "Beyond the Sea" is the worst, but it continues to prove that Kevin Spacey is an amazing actor. He does save the movie. I love Bobby Darrin, and throughout the film I could feel my head, and many others, bobbing to the music. Kevin Spacey did his own singing for the film, and he is almost as good as Darrin, but not better.  I was very upset that I didn't like the film, because I was looking forward to it. It looked promising, but it's main problem was that nothing that it did quite worked with the flow. It kept changing moods. It also didn't give us a look at the real Bobby Darrin. We only get to see one side of him, and that's the side that we like. We never see him as a person, and just this carefree, fun guy, so that in the end when he dies, you don't care, because it's like when a background character dies in a war movie.<br /><br />The movie is told as if Bobby Darrin was making a movie about his life, playing himself. He talks to himself as a child for ideas, and the story starts when he was a child. His mother, Polly, is talking to the doctor, and finds out that he has a heart problem, and he'll be lucking if he lives past his 15th birthday. He passes that age, and every day he lives makes him more and more of a medical marvel. His mother teaches him to play the piano, and sing, and soon he is preforming on the stage in nightclubs, always striving to do better. It's when he decides to make movies where he meets Sandra Dee, played well by the cute Kate Bosworth. He puts it in his mind that he is going to marry her, so he decides to charm the mother before he charms her. She falls in love with him, and they are soon engaged, much to the dismay of her mother. Soon, his own mother dies, and then he learns of a secret from his sister Nina, and her husband Charlie. Bobby always wants more, and he's nominated for an Oscar Award, gets tons of songs number one on the charts, and is one of the most celebrated musicians in the world, but he still wants more, and he doesn't stop until he gets it.<br /><br />I'm not the kind of person that usually notes this, because I hate when people do. When "Troy," came out, which I liked, and "Alexander" which I didn't, all I heard from history teachers was that it wasn't what actually happened. Of course everything in the movie didn't happen, it's a movie, but Bobby Darrin actually divorced Sandra Dee years before he died, and was remarried and seprated right before he did. The movie doesn't talk about this at all, and at the end when they recap all the characters, it states that Sandra Dee is still alive and loves Bobby Darrin to this day. Not only is that probably untrue, but it is also one of the most overused, cliche, mock "happy" endings that I've ever seen. I rolled my eyes at that even before I learned about that information.<br /><br />What "Beyond the Sea" tried to do was give the movie that old musical feel. I recently saw "Singin' in the Rain," and loved it. What made all the overacting, and lavish set/costume design, and big musical numbers work, was that when Gene Kelly was splashing around in the puddles, and when Donald O' Conner was playing with a giant doll and crashing through brick walls, it all served a purpose. When Kevin Spacey grabs the suitcase that was thrown at him from his mother to go run down the street with everybody in the town waving at him, it didn't serve a purpose but to be fun and light, and it was pretty stupid. And then it went from this jovial, brightly colored, musical drama, and then it turned into this drama where Bobby is trying to "find himself." Most of the scenes didn't work. For instance, when Bobby and Charlie are walking into someplace, Nina is yelling at the limo driver because she dropped her suitcases. It's trying to be funny, but it's just annoying. As much as I love Kevin Spacey, his acting and singing couldn't get this movie past two stars, and it's going to be towards the bottom of my worst movies of the year list. Worth seeing on video for the singing though. I didn't like it, but you might.<br /><br />ENJOY!<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for some strong language and a scene of sensuality.</p></body></html>

Well, it has, and after watching this update of Robert Wise's classic 1951 film, one has to wonder why it was remade in the first place.  That's not to say that it's a bad film per se, which it isn't, it just really doesn't amount to a whole lot in the end.  The biggest problem that The Day the Earth Stood Still has lies in its actors.  Keanu Reeves' cardboard persona strangely fits into playing Klaatu, but the rest of the cast, including Jennifer Connelly, Jaden "son of Will" Smith, Kathy Bates, Mad Men's Jon Hamm, Friday Night Lights' Kyle Chandler, John Cleese, and Prison Break's Robert Knepper, are either wasted in their roles or just sleepwalk in them.  The CGI effects of destruction however are wonderfully done however, and worth seeing the film for alone, as it is capably directed by Scott Derrickson, features a great score from Tyler Bates, and is frequently compelling.  Despite all that though, the film never reaches its potential, and it certainly doesn't come anywhere close to the original either.  All in all, The Day the Earth Stood Still remake isn't a terrible film, but it certainly isn't anything to celebrate either.  Still, if CGI sequences of destruction are your thing, give this a look.</p></body></html>

If you haven't seen this five Oscar winner, then it is about time that you did.<br /><br />A sexual serial killer known as Buffalo Bill, is kidnapping women across Midwest America, murdering them and dumping their mutilated bodies near a river. Behavioral science division of the FBI sends Agent Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) on a mission to a prison/hospital for the criminally insane to interview the serial killer Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) to see if he can help with the investigation by giving her clues for a psychological profile of Buffalo Bill. Hannibal the Cannibal is cryptic and illusive sending Starling around the country mostly searching for something unknown that Hannibal has directed her towards. Not only does he give her some details as to the psychological profile of the killer but he eludes to much more than she originally thought he knew. Hannibal starts to play games with Starling, ever eager to impress her boss, by giving her a psychological profile of herself in return for more information about the case. An uncanny and often dangerous relationship begins and things take a turn for the worse when a senator's daughter is kidnapped causing various government agencies to impede the case which sets up a gripping climax as the illusive Lecter plays people into his own hands.<br /><br />Essentially it is smart horror movie with lots of dialogue, plot and suspense. It is both mystical and disturbing. Demme often uses the camera directly with the actor looking at you to make the movie more "personal" in nature.<br /><br />Thoroughly engaging. This is the film that set new benchmarks in the modern horror/suspense/thriller genres. Often copied, never equaled. It is easy to fall under the spell of this piece of cinema.</p></body></html>

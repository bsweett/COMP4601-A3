<meta name="summary" content="Overdone revenge"></head><body><p>I liked the acting was good; no wonder as they are talented actors. I did particularly like Lucy Liu effort that I thought was a nice touch in the story. The characters well several are overdone but it made for interesting stories. I was wondering how they all were to come together but when they did the stories with there twists were good. It was over the top but then that is Hollywood.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hannibal Lecter as comic book avenger"></head><body><p>*SPOILERS*<br /><br />So just how does one go from being a carefree, apple-cheeked schoolboy to becoming the most notorious, cannibalistic serial killer in literary history?  "Hannibal Rising" thinks it has the answer.  First, you watch as Nazis mow down your parents in cold blood.  Then, you look on helplessly as a band of starving Lithuanian soldiers carve up and eat your little sister.  Finally, you enroll in med school so you will not only acquire intimate knowledge of the human anatomy but will have unlimited access to disemboweled cadavers and tools of dismemberment that will come in mighty handy in your off-duty hours.<br /><br />The very concept of Hannibal Lecter is so off-putting and distasteful (pardon the pun) that it really only works when you have an actor of the caliber of Anthony Hopkins on hand to, in some way at least, "humanize" the character.  For without the "charisma" Hopkins brought to the role, Lecter becomes just another garden-variety psycho - and the movies themselves mere exercises in cheap, tawdry exploitation.<br /><br />This is the single greatest problem with this alleged "prequel" to the Academy Award-winning "Silence of the Lambs."  Hard as it tries, it really can't make Lecter's transformation all that compelling or believable.  And without that shield to protect us, the goriness and unpleasantness come rushing over us with full, unabated force.  Admittedly, there`s a certain purgative kick in watching the cannibals get their comeuppance at the hand of one of their victims, but you`ll still probably feel like taking a shower after the movie.  About the only interesting aspect to the story is how each of the three main characters has chosen a different way to cope with the loss of family members in the war:  Lecter (Gaspard Ulliel), of course, turns to revenge murders and cannibalism; the chief inspector (Dominic West) goes after unpunished war criminals; and Lecter's beautiful Japanese aunt (Li Gong) helps protect her nephew from the full force of the law.  But such analysis is going way too far in justifying a movie whose sole purpose for existing is to turn the audience's stomach as it caters to the propensity for vicarious sadism that resides in the human species.<br /><br />Those who made "Hannibal Rising" have taken a character who was terrifying precisely because his actions COULDN'T be explained in any rational manner - and thus any one of us could fall victim to his madness - and have turned him into a conventional Angel of Vengeance stamping out evildoers and injustice, with the imprimatur of "divine righteousness" to give him moral cover.  In short, they have transmogrified him into little more than a comic book action figure (albeit an extremely dark one).  Not that it`s any big deal in the grand scheme of things, but "Hannibal Rising" might be more accurately entitled "Hannibal Falling."</p></body></html>

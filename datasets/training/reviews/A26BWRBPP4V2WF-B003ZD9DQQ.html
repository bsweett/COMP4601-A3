<meta name="summary" content="A fascinating portrait of Hitler's timely demise"></head><body><p>Ultimately, Adolf Hitler met a cowardly and ignominious death - many of his allies and friends (e.g., Himmler and G&ouml;ring) had fled the incoming Soviet invasion in efforts to save their own skins.  Hitler, refusing to leave, committed the almost-as-cowardly act of killing himself and leaving his subordinates saddled with the order to "fight to the last bullet" and "leave Germany as an unlivable wasteland".  This film tells the story of the last few days of Hitler's life, and in fact continues for a few days thereafter.  The action scenes are few and intermittent, and after having seen Saving Private Ryan, they are not particularly shocking.  What is shocking, at least to a North American viewer, is the utter dominance Hitler still had over the German people and its military leaders.  Many of them honestly believed that, even with Soviet artillery shells raining down on the centre of Berlin, Hitler would be able to pull off a miracle and save the Third Reich from destruction.  So convincing are the actors and so compelling is the story, that Hitler's famous movements of non-existent formations to the relief of Berlin  is not comedic or incredible, but oddly depressing and pathetic.<br /><br />This is an all-German production (although, ironically, the exterior location shots were filmed in Saint Petersburg), and they make ample use of the memoirs and autobiographies of Hitler's contemporaries and employees, including interviews with those Nazis still alive at the time of pre-production.  Much was based on the book "Hitler's Last Secretary" (the English translation's title), in which Traudl Junge prints excerpts from a diary she wrote immediately after WWII ended.  Using the secretaries' points of view is a wise decision by the filmmakers, as they are outside the Party apparatus and are mainly viewing the madness around them, just as we are as movie watchers.  The filmmakers have made every effort to only show onscreen events that actually happened, and even went so far as to attempt to determine where Keitel, Jodl, Bormann, and the others stood during the F&uuml;hrer's war conferences.  Not only does this lend authenticity to the events, but (along with the superb acting of all the players) makes the film feel like a "true" depiction of what life was like in the G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung last days of the Third Reich.<br /><br />A potential problem with the film for the average non-German viewer is that there appears to be no logical or even emotional reason for the generals to continue to obey and revere Hitler right up to the end.  The timeframe is too short to see Hitler's charismatic rise to power, his devotion to the German working-class who formed his power base (and their devotion to him), his near-perfect military record in the first 3 years of the war where he was repeatedly proven right and the Wehrmacht general staff officers proven wrong.  I would also have liked to have seen more emphasis on Bormann, the only other high-ranking Nazi official (along with Goebbels) who stayed with Hitler to the bitter end.  Where the film steps bravely, and I think importantly, is the celebrated (and condemned) portrayal of Hitler and the other high-end Nazis as human beings.  It is unquestionable that Hitler collected a number of synchophants and star-chasers around him, and that they might not have been particularly intellegent (his alienation of people like Guderian and Rommel is evidence that independent thinking was not tolerated in the F&uuml;hrerhauptquartier).  The only possible misstep is the promotion of a "hero" in the person of Col. Schenk, "Inspector of Nutrition" for the Waffen SS.  He apparently selflessly wishes to serve in Berlin to provide medical help to soldiers and civilians, but this is the same man who callously used slave labour at the Dachau concentration camp for nutritional experiments.<br /><br />To summarize, this is a fascinating and engrossing look inside the final days of the Third Reich.  The performances are fantastic, and the film has an authenticity (even a "truth") that is rare and raises the film to a high level of importance.<br /><br />Extras on this DVD edition supplement and add to the experience.  There are interviews with the authors of the books on which the film is primarily based, and also with the actors protraying the parts.  It is refreshing to see that all these actors took their parts very seriously and did extensive outside reading to ensure their performances were authentic.  The biggest kudos have to be reserved for Ganz (Hitler) and Harfouch (Frau Goebbels) who have the hardest people to portray, and somehow embody them as real people, not cartoon carricatures of teeth-gnashing villiany.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Touching & Hilarious Comedy About Finding Purpose In The Beauty Pageant That Is Life"></head><body><p>MOVIE: There has been a lot of garbage out in the theaters so far this year. The only movies I can list that I truly found to be great were United 93, DaVinci Code, Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, and now Little Miss Sunshine. This is one of the best films of the year, and the first movie that deserves some attention from Oscar voters. The story is about a family who takes a road trip to enter their daughter into the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. We start the story and our ensamble cast is introduced one by one. We have Richard the overcontroling father, Sheryl the loving mother, their foul mouthed grandpa, the rebel son, Frank the suicidal homosexual genius uncle, and little Olive. I could spend a long time just describing the brilliance of each character and what they all mean to the plot, but that would take awhile. So, now this dysfunctional family goes on a roadtrip to California so that their daughter can enter the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. What follows is a heartwarming, emotional, and hilarious journey. Each character finds their own personal journey through Olive. Olive is the center of the film that holds the family together. The film isn't called Little Miss Sunshine beacause of the beauty pageant, it's because of Olive. This sweet innocent girl has no idea of the world around her, and no idea that she is the center of the family. A great scene in the film has Dwayne, the rebel son, refusing to get off the side of the road and continue with the trip even though everyone else is trying to comfort him into getting back in the car. Then his sister comes and rests her hand on his shoulder, he looks up at her, gets up and carries her back to the car. The film addresses many of life's problems and basically shows how it's all one big beauty pageant, but of course beauty doesn't matter at all. The only complaint I had about the film, which constitutes it's 3.5 stars, was the ending. I can't really say anything without ruining it, but let's just say it left a lot to be desired. I felt like the story deserved a more complete resolution versus what we were given.<br /><br />ACTING: The film is filled with an incredible cast, and I mean incredible. Greg Kinnear, Toni Collette, Alan Arkin, Paul Dano, Steve Carell, and Abigail Breslin all give outstanding performances. Steve Carell is an amazing actor and I really feel like he's going to get nominated for his role here. The film is truly something special and the script definately calls for an ensamble, which they deliver.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Right now I am calling nominations for Steve Carell and Michael Arndt's amazing screenplay. Who new that this first time screenwriter would produce such a rich script. You also have to acknowledge the superb directing from real life married couple, Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris. We may just be looking at the Best Picture of the year, what a suprise if it did go on to win.</p></body></html>

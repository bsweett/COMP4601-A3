But the Academy Awards have fallen to such an extent, that it's difficult to take them seriously anymore, unless you want to sift through the nominations for the real gold.  Connelly, Kingsley, and Shohred Aghdashloo all give award worthy performances in a story that has, by its end, enough bodies tragically left on the stage to call up comparisons with Shakespeare or Euripedes.  <p>There are holes in the story - but there are holes in Lear for that matter.  For example, Connelly's (Kathi Niccoli in the film) cop lover (Ron Eldard) is not to be believed in his stupidity.  If his role wasn't so pivotal, it could easily be brushed off.  Further, surrounded by the three main actors, he ends up looking like a deer caught in the headlights.  Then there's the real estate question - it seems a bit of stretch in our super litigious society that a repossession and sale could occur so quickly given a cloud on the title...but I'm nitpicking.  <p>The overwhelming drama of the story far outweighs these problems.  Connelly is superb as the vague and lost house cleaner Kathi.  Her performance has the kind of nuance and depth that I didn't find in her Oscar winning effort in "A Beautiful Mind."  At least Connelly is showing, unlike other recent babe winners (Berry, Roberts, Kidman), she has both the looks and the acting chops.  Kingsley.  What can you say?  The guy is just a great actor who should have a row of Oscars by now. (To get a sense of his range, check out "Sexy Beast.") As the Iranian Colonel Behrani, Kingsley supplies a character that is proud (too proud as it turns out), a lover of tradition, but not so inflexible that he hasn't a heart when the moment calls for it.  He is a good but flawed man who loves his family and is trying to do the best for them.  And finally, there is Shored Aghdashloo's performance as Nadi, a good woman crushed by events.  Nadi's struggles with the language, her kindness to Kathi, the love (and tension) that exists between her and her husband, are all finely balanced and incorporated into a real human being and not another Hollywood cut-out. (Boy did she get ripped off at the Oscars.  I guess her name just wasn't zippy enough.)  Essentially, the heart of "House" is found in the way these three great actors play off of each other.  And it is something special to behold, turning the tragic wheel ever tighter as the movie progresses.  The ending wasn't really a surprise - shock to me, but rather inexorable, much like Medea stringing up her kids.</p></body></html>

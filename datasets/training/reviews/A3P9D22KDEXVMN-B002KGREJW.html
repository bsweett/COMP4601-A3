The acting was really top notch and what sets the film apart.  The story was amusing.  For the amount of sight gags involved, I didn't expect the very dramatic and almost sad side of the movie.  Overall I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys dark comedy and is not easily offended.  There are a couple of parts of the movie that are pretty sick, even obscene.  Just watch, and you will know what I mean.  Abigail Breslin was really outstanding as the contest entrant.  Her energetic personality was a perfect contrast to the stark despair that existed in many of the other characters.  Steve Carell was great (as usual).  The movie's theme is best summarized in a Proust quote that Carell delivers in a very poignant moment towards the end of the film.</p></body></html>

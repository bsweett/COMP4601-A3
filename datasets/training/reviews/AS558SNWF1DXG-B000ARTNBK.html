<meta name="summary" content="The Four is goofy, flaky fun"></head><body><p>It's been a dark summer for big-budget blockbusters.<br /><br />Anakin Skywalker got amputated and incinerated in the latest "Star Wars" installment.<br /><br />Brangelina rediscovered their G-spots by kicking the hell out of each other in "Mr. and Mrs. Smith."<br /><br />The Scarecrow dosed Gotham City with some major bad trips in "Batman Begins."<br /><br />And Martian tripods turned Earthlings into white ash, driftwood or tomato paste in "War of the Worlds."<br /><br />Just as this summer's hits reached their bleakest pitch (and just as Thursday's bombings in London completely trumped the movies on the horror scale), a different kind of popcorn flick emerges.<br /><br />It's big. It's dumb. It's fun. It's "Fantastic Four," an adaptation of the Marvel Comics series about a quartet of humans transformed into superheroes.<br /><br />Scientists Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) and pilots Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), rocket into space, catch a blast of a cosmic wave and return to Earth with strange new abilities: Reed can stretch his limbs like elastic; Sue can become invisible and project force fields; Johnny can generate and control flames; and Ben is transformed into a hulking, stone-skinned behemoth.<br /><br />Naturally, they have no choice but to use their powers for the greater good.<br /><br />On comic book pages, the Fantastic Four were always heavier "advanced placement" heroes: They were independently wealthy and most of their adventures involved space travel and quantum physics; secure in their fancy high-rise, the Four didn't even bother with secret identities.<br /><br />But director Tim Story, and writers Michael France and Mark Frost, have adapted the saga into something infinitely less serious and enjoyably goofy. Here, the science, and most of the drama, is strictly on the level of "Gilligan's Island," though with a little more irony and funnier jokes.<br /><br />Onscreen, Gruffudd's Reed Richards, for example, is no longer the grim intellect of the comic book but a bankrupt, absent-minded egghead whom another character aptly calls, "the world's dumbest smart guy."<br /><br />The filmmakers focus most of the movie on the Four's attempts to understand and deal with their new powers, with occasional asides as the camera ogles Alba in her skintight supersuit. Gigantic plot holes abound and a big showdown at the end almost feels like an afterthought.<br /><br />But this is one of those movies in which plot holes and bad lines are beside the point, and the movie's giddy tone is set by Evans' Human Torch, a kid who's simply ecstatic to discover he's got superpowers. Though Michael Chiklis, as the deformed Ben Grimm, stands out as the movie's sulking heart.<br /><br />Longtime comic book fans, and viewers who can't relax and go with the flow, may absolutely hate this movie, and honestly I sometimes couldn't tell if I was laughing with it or at it. But considering this is a story that involves rubber-faced heroes, cosmic waves and bad guys with names like "Victor Von Doom," it's probably best spun as a comedy. It just wouldn't play straight.<br /><br />Without a doubt, "Fantastic Four" is the dumbest smart movie of the summer</p></body></html>

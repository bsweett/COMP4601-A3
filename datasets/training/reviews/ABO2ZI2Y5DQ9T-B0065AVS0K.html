<meta name="summary" content="(3.5 STARS) Frank Miller's Noir World: Extremely Brutal, But Visually Stunning"></head><body><p>It's graphic book version of 'Kill Bill,' it's pitch dark, it's violent, it's nasty, it's whatever makes you sick, and it's very fascinating.  Not everyone would find the film that way, and I confess I am not a big fan of this film or Frank Miller's original books, but I still kept watching this brutal world where the revenge story of The Bride is enacted on everyday basis.<br /><br />Perhaps it is pointless to repeat the story after more than 500 reviewers pasted their own views.  As they said, 'Sin City' means the title itself, the city filled with crimes and violence, where the dark world of the original comic book comes alive.  Three stories, each of which are connected tangentially (ala 'Pulp Fiction'), features three tough guys: Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, and Clive Owen.  And all of their stories involve women, as old noir films do.<br /><br />[BRITTANY MURPHY SAID ... ] I would like to add something else.  Brittany Murphy, who came to Japan to promote the film (with Devon Aoki), during the interview with Yahoo Japan strongly recommended that those viewers who find the content too sick should wait for Mickey Rourke.  She said, 'it's 'meant to be funny.'<br /><br />Funny?  She said so clearly.  I'd rather say 'darkly funny' but she made a good point about Rourke.  Marv, played by Mickey Rourke, vows a revenge for a beautiful girl who slept with him just one night, and follows those responsible no matter what it takes.  As you see, the story itself is nothing new, just a standard noir one.  But it is the way of revenge or killing that matters.  Bullets are too ordinary.  You should be Hannibal Lector to claim originality in Sin City.<br /><br />[MICKEY'S SEMI-COMEBACK]  Among the various players gathering for this rare chance to become the comic book characters themselves, Mickey Rourke steals every scene in this film.  In fact, almost all actors are excellent ... I said 'almost' because Bruce Willis looks exactly Bruce Willis (perhaps that is not a bad thing), and Josh Hartnett, Elijah Wood, and Nick Stahl, all cast against type, are less convincing and impressive than Rourke, Owen, or Benicio Del Toro.<br /><br />As to the story and script 'Sin City' needs more re-writes.  Frequent voice-overs are annoying to me, and some materials are used too much (like torture and imprisonement). 'Sin City' is not as groundbreaking as 'Pulp Fiction' but is visually rivetting, no question about it.</p></body></html>

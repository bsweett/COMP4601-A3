<meta name="summary" content="One of the best of 2002!"></head><body><p>One of the absolute best crafted films of 2002, The Hours flawlessly combines the stories of three similar women in different times during one significant day of their lives.<p>The women; author Virginia Wolfe (Nicole Kidman), a 1950s housewife (Julianne Moore), and a modern day magazine editor (Meryl Streep), are the core of this film. Each feels trapped in a life they're not happy with, and want to find a way to improve it, or end it. This is a heavy film, dealing with suicide, sexual identity, love and happiness. And between the cross-cutting  in time, the film could have been a terrible mess. But instead director Stephen Daldry created a masterpiece. He never stays too long with one woman, knowing the exact moment to switch to another story. But each story is fully engaging, drawing you in.<p>Equally as astounding, if not more so, is the superb acting by each and every actor. If anyone stands it, though, it would be Kidman. She absolutely becomes Virginia Wolfe in a restrained, sorrowful way. She deserves the best actress win here. Moore and Streep also give powerhouse performances, but Ed Harris's magnificent supporting role as an AIDS stricken man is as astounding as Kidman's. His physical transformation is astounding in itself. John C. Reilly also turns in a good performance as Moore's disillusioned husband, but no one performs less then amazingly.<p>The subject matter may be a downer, but that doesn't make the film any less perfect. How it deals with sadness and the desire for happiness is realistic for many people experiencing depression. The world we live in is far from perfect, and this film shows how if we're not careful, it can bring us down in despair.<p>The Hours is a rare, wonderful film that deserves any awards it gets Oscar night. Though it may not be very cheerful, it is one of the best of the year. It gets my highest recommendation.</p></body></html>

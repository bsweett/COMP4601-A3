<meta name="summary" content="Train Kept a Rollin'"></head><body><p>If <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/080017948X">Groundhog Day</a> were written by Tom Clancy, David Baldacci or one of those guys that can craftily weave a tale of terrorism, you may have just ended up with Source Code. Instead of comedy with Bill Murray you get an action film with Jake Gyllenhaal that exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />Gyllenhaal connects to the Source Code through a device that allows him to experience the last eight minutes of a person's life. The movie explains that this is not necessarily time travel, but rather placing the user in an alternate time line, universe or something like that. Um...okay. Even though I've tried and failed to get my mind around the difference and what exactly it all means, I still thoroughly enjoyed the movie from start to finish. The movie keeps the action and suspense coming as Gyllenhaal time after time is thrown back in time...er, I mean, into an alternate whatever...in order to discover the location of a bomb aboard a train and more importantly identify who put it there and detonated it.<br /><br />Gyllenhaal practically is a one man show albeit with some rather small supporting moments from the other main characters. Source Code might just be Gyllenhaal's best performance to date (that I've seen). I guess some kudos should also go to Michelle Monaghan for playing her part so uniquely but also precisely in the succession of "on the train again "Groundhog Dayesque" sequences. And keep an eye out for Director Duncan Jones next project, because if it's a s good as Source Code or his last project called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002T9H2ME">Moon</a> it'll will be something worth waiting for and watching.<br /><br />Check Source Code out if you're looking for a good action flick.</p></body></html>

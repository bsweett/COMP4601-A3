Anderson's charnel house of a videogame-to-movie zombie opus "Resident Evil", a hyper-kinetic, supremely stylish, super cool barrage of living Dead and corporate wickedness.<br /><br />Instead of plowing its profits and R&D budget into detergents and oven cleaners, the nasty Umbrella Corporation has built itself a big bad virological bug. But as go the best laid plans of mice and men, the Big Bad Bug gets out into the uber-secret underground laboratory/think-tank/weapons factory that is the Hive, and the Hive's super-genius super-computer called the Red Queen gets all twitchy, snuffing all hands on board---with extreme prejudice.<br /><br />The fun is just getting started. Cut to former shiny-happy Umbrella Corporation employee Alice (played tastily by actress-model-singer Milla Jovovich) waking up in the shower of a mansion with no memory as to how she got there. Not to worry, as she soon has plenty of company: a crack-squad of commandos sent in to do a by-the-numbers infiltration: get in, shut down the psychotic Red Queen, get out. Simplicity itself, right?<br /><br />Dead wrong. Everybody in the Hive is dead---but they just don't seem to want to stay down. Slaughter, high-style, ample blood and goop, and a note-perfect Marilyn Manson score ensues, and our marines have to look sharp or find themselves turned into zombie chewtoys.<br /><br />If you're looking for insanely high style, zombie chewing goodness, some nice scares, a good workout for your home entertainment system, model-actress-singer Milla Jovovich in a torn mini-skirt kicking wire-fu butt against undead Doberman pinschers, and all of this served up with a generous side-order of the Red Sauce---well, brothers and sisters, you've come to the right flick! Make sure the safety's off your 9mm Ruger, sling the double barreled shotgun at combat ready---that's you, Soldier!---and let's head deep into the zombie-haunted hallways of the Hive.<br /><br />Zombie purists were concerned when original director, and zombie Grand-Master, George Romero turned the reins over to Paul Anderson, who had a choppy directorial resume: he had previously helmed the lackluster "Soldier" and the grisly if silly space-opera gruefest "Event Horizon". They need not have fretted; from the opening credits to the apocalytpic coda, Anderson proves a master stylist, working with cinematographer Dave Johnson (who worked with Anderson on "Alien versus Predator") to deliver ample zombie-chewing fun with a tight editing technique that serves up the carnage with a mix of brutality and flair.<br /><br />The acting here is equally note-perfect: Milla is at the top of her game and shows off her acting chops as well as her more corporeal talents; in the hands of a lesser actress the role would have been generic action-flick fodder. Michelle Rodriguez (Ocampo) keeps snarling and cracking wise 'til the bitter end; Eric Mabius is charmingly and appropriately plastic (where is his character coming from, anyway?) and also carries off his role like a champ. Colin Salmon (James "One" Shade) once again bravely carries Shakespearean delivery into Anderson's laser jaws of death, while James Purefoy does what he has to do as the poor man's Chris Lambert. He's a good villain, and because of that you end up rooting for the zombies and even the digusting "Licker".<br /><br />But look, the real delight here is the way Paul Anderson, cinematographer Johnson, and composer Marilyn Manson all work together to play out their gory magic on a palette of silence. Can you beat the scene where the Red Queen is first shut down, the blast doors all slide open, and there is that palpable hiss against the tomb-like quiet of the Hive---and then the groans of the shuffling, shambling, *very* hungry dead? Or when, after a second's reprieve, the survivors cower in a control room from an undead bio-engineered abomination, hungry to get in, pounding at a bulkhead blast-door? The movie is at its best when it is a series of gorgeous shifts from dead quiet to blood-thirsty crescendo.<br /><br />The Hive and its environs are so brilliantly executed that Anderson effectively creates another character in the set-pieces alone, from the parquet and marble digs of the Mansion to the sleek, techno-sexy sterility of the Hive, to the goth-industrial Road-to-Nowhere that is the train---all of this adds to the horror and frame the desperation of our heroes as they war against the Living Dead (the train station and Hive Entrance being an actual underground system in Berlin!). Few films manage to bring everything together like "Resident Evil", and Anderson is to be commended in making it all work out in spades.<br /><br />Finally, kudos to Anderson's team for mixing up effective CGI with animatronics: in the last few years, horror directors have taken the easy road with cheap computer-generated effects, and happily Anderson opts for tastily gory animatronic models that give beasties like the "Licker" the respect they deserve.<br /><br />A word should be said about the special features here: while it's a treat to have a ticket to the less ambitious "Resident Evil: Apocalypse", fans of the original will find the six segments on the special effects centerpieces of the film tasty, particularly in the mix between good old-fashioned animatronics and CGI. The alternate ending is amusing for completists, if only to show just how critical a solid editor can be. And without a doubt, the hysterical main commentary track with Anderson, Jovovich, and Rodriguez is worth the price of admission alone. Lucky, lucky Paul Anderson.<br /><br />The billion dollar question, of course, is---is "Resident Evil" scary? Imagine being locked up in the wilderland of the cubicle with flesh hungry co-workers, armed only with your wits and a 9mm automatic. You tell me, Soldier---you tell me.</p></body></html>

Heavy on the love story with moments of light humor flavor this story.  The other reviews sum up the story already, so you already know that two people that lived in the same Lake House somehow manage to communicate with each other through letters in the mailbox even though one lives in 2006 and the other in 2004.  The story basically revolves around them falling in love through the letters and the possibilities of them meeting.  Sometimes Reeves seems a little stiff, but he is charming enough.  Bullock is great as always.  The magic of the mailbox is never explained, nor is the improbabilities of him changing things in the past that somehow work out perfectly in the future.  Still it was a nice story, and Reeves and Bullock certainly have charisma together.  I would give this one a try.</p></body></html>

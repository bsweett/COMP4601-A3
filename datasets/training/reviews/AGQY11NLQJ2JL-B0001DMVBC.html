<meta name="summary" content="Be prepared to an intense, shocking emotional journey!"></head><body><p>Have you ever lost everything you worked for and your life became focused only on restoring your legacy? Have you been extremely depressed that even opening your mail became an extraordinarily difficult task? Has fate treated you so horribly that you keep going in circles without a chance to catch your breath? Has your life revolved around one thing, and one thing only, that without it, you started to lose your existential footing? If you never experienced despair before, or your intellect is a shallow lake, you might miss the point of this movie and judge it harshly like many reviewers. On the other hand, you might be lucky enough to understand the real meaning of life and empathize with each and every character in this movie. I thought no movie could replicate the greatness and depth of the book, but with phenomenal performances by all and equally fantastic direction, this movie captures the essence of the book and lead you down a deep well of insight and intense feeling.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Actor Colin Farrell, Writer Martin McDonagh"></head><body><p>Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson turn in truly remarkable performances as two hit men on the lam in Bruges, Belgium, of all places. Colin Farrell's Ray is none too bright, comical, guilt-ridden, immature, and he suffers from a hair-triggered hot temper. As he clownishly mugs his way through the early part of the movie, pouting and sulking like the kid he is, his face becomes a rubbery map of his utter disdain for the cultural beauties of Bruges while his thick black eyebrows dance up and down mirroring his mood changes. By shooting a blank in a man's eye, he starts a chain of inevitable events that lead to tragedy.<br /> Gleeson's Ken, sensitive, bright, also funny, falls in love with the architectural charm of the Medieval city. For brief moments it's a Laurel and Hardy romp between the two men. There are stunning shots of the city throughout the movie. Why is Ken chaperoning Ray anyway? Early on touristy Ken is on top of a tower. With his hand he makes an imaginary gun and pops one off on the cloddish Ray down at street level.<br /> Hilarious is the scene in which three obese American tourists ask Colin about going up in the tower. He ends up being chased by the father and dancing around him. His brilliance is evident throughout the movie as he plays a character akin to the one he played in "Cassandra's Dream."<br /> Ray falls for a girl who is part of a movie company filming in Bruges, a company that includes a dwarf, a character that becomes crucial to the plot. Rays says, "They're filming midgets." Drugs, sex, and jealousy are introduced, and Ray's fateful journey proceeds a few more paces into inevitability like a Greek tragedy that cannot end until all is settled.<br />Late in the movie Ralph Fiennes turns in a great performance as a manic, rabid killer-boss.<br />The movie was written and directed by Martin McDonagh. For those familiar with his plays on Broadway and elsewhere ("The Lieutenant of Inishmore, "The Pillowman," "The Cripple of Inishmaan"), they will know to expect theater of the absurd inane dialogue, wild swings between the comic and the violent, lots of blood and gore, black comedy, and brilliant story set-ups and plotting.<br />I watched the DVD in widescreen (not bad), but I turned on the English subtitles because Farrell's Irish brogue defies quick comprehension by the uninitiated. This is a masterful movie, but be aware it's violent and bloody. But awfully funny too. Black comedy, anyone?</p></body></html>

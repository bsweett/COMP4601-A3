Here, the story involves Professor Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser), his nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) and Hannah, an attractive Icelandic mountain guide (Anita Briem), and their many misadventures as they stumble upon a an old mine and "volcano tube" that drops them deep into a marvelous subterranean world. Can they make it out alive?<br /><br />One glance at the poster or dvd and the viewer will instantly know what s/he is in for -- a fun, mindless adventure in the spirit of "Indiana Jones", which is understandable in view of the fact that the first Indiana Jones film ripped-off two scenes from the 1959 version of "Journey" (the 'guiding light' and huge rolling stone sequences). This 2008 rendition even features a thrilling rollercoaster-like railcar sequence a la "Temple of Doom," although it's done better here IMHO. There's also a t-rex sequence reminiscent of "Jurassic Park," but the oversized reptile is more cartooney here (interesting how filmmakers still aren't able to outdo that t-rex sequence a full 15 years later!).<br /><br />I won't compare this version to the 1959 rendition with James Mason, Pat Boone and Arlene Dahl since that film was made a half century ago! Needless to say, these are two totally different movies from two totally different eras. I will say, however, that it's not as long & tedious and there's no pet duck -- lol (not that I dislike that one).<br /><br />Normally I'm not into mindless "blockbusters" like this but if they're done right and I'm in the proper mood for mindless fun adventure I'm usually able to acclimate and enjoy them for what they are. Such is the case here. Brendan Fraser is the perfect actor for these types of films (e.g. 1999's "The Mummy); he's got that likable, benevolent 'everyman' charm. In addition, Anita Briem is easy on the eyes. It's surprising that there are only three main characters in the entire film, but they have great chemistry and you can tell they had a fun time filming; it transfers to the viewer.<br /><br />This is a family-friendly misadventure with the requisite goofy humor, which caused me to bust out laughing numerous times. I think it's better than the three Indiana Jones sequels ("Temple of Doom," "Last Crusade" and "Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"). The only reason I detract a Star is my mind started wandering a bit after the t-rex sequence late in the film. Other than that, this is a highly entertaining zany adventure flick full of spunk and wonder. That said, I'm glad it only runs an hour and a half as films of this ilk should stay around the 90-minute mark so as not to risk overstaying their welcome (e.g. the three "Pirates of the Carribean" flicks).<br /><br />I also enjoyed the desolate, mountainous Icelandic locations seen early in the picture.<br /><br />One last thing: The dvd features the option of viewing the film in 3D or regular (one side or the other) and provides four pairs of 3D glasses for the former. I tried the 3D version and wasn't impressed; the 3D gimmick just doesn't do much for me and I especially dislike the dingy overall picture it offers. Needless to say, I recommend viewing the film in non-3D.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: Turn off your brain and have a blast!</p></body></html>

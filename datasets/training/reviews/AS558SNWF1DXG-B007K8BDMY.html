<meta name="summary" content="Da Bears!"></head><body><p>Werner Herzog has pieced together the home movie footage of Tim Treadwell, a self-styled mountain man who attempted to co-exist with bears in the Alaskan wilds and eventually got eaten.  He also got his girlfriend eaten.<br /><br />It's a chilling, darkly ironic tale with an edge that's almost Pythonesque.<br /><br />It's also a stark, cold parable about self-delusion; the uncaring randomness of nature and fate; knowing one's limitations; and the perils of being an unwanted outsider.<br /><br />But I think the main thing viewers should and will take from this documentary is: Don't go where the bears are.  And if you must go where the bears are, don't mess with the bears.  You may think they are digging your Thoreau act, but they don't speak our language.  And they will eat you.</p></body></html>

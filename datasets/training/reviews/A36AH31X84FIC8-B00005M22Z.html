<meta name="summary" content="A Very Excellent Stargate Set."></head><body><p>OK To You Out There Who Don't Own This Wonderful Sci-Fi Action Motion Picture. then i would suggest in getting it because it a great set not only do you get the theatrical version that was shown in theaters the  first time, but you get the director's cut which in my opinion is better. the sound and picture are excellent  those of you with a good dolby sound systems should try the 6.1 mix it great and at this price you'd be crazy not to. i think the story of stargate is just wonderful it's about time travel and lost civilizations James Spader  stars as a professor of archaeology and ancient languages is contacted by the government to solve a mystery within it's wall once opened then maybe secrets can be revealed of long lost  civilization in another universe. it's great story love it.<br /><br />It Stars: James Spader ( Of Pretty in Pink  ) Kurt Russell ( The Thing, OverBoard,Backdraft )<br /><br />Update Note: My review was for the original release with both versions of film in the case, although the director's  cut is much better. it would've been nicer if they would have  left this edition alone and left the original cut in this set and not confused the public.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="1988 Tim Burton film, dvd."></head><body><p>Tim Burton's unique vision, which is almost cartoonish at times, really comes across, in this film. A dark comedy, that accents the humor, rather than the horror. Also noteworthy is, Michael Keaton's character, which is not only annoying to the living, but the dead as well. Winona Ryder's character is also interesting to watch.</p></body></html>

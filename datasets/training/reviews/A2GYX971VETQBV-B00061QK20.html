Many have knocked the martial arts sequences in HERO as being horribly unrealistic and that this fact has ruined the movie.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  True, the martial arts in this film are not the "realistic" acrobatics of Jackie Chan.  Instead, it is pure visual poetry.  These martial arts sequences are absolutely beautiful to watch.  Anyone that can watch them without coming away with a sense of awe is just plain blind in my book.<br /><br />In fact, that goes for the entire movie.  HERO is one of the most gorgeous films I have seen in a long time.  Not only are the sequences superb, but the scenic locations are also breathtaking.  Moreover, the extensive use of color is astounding.  While watching it, I felt completely transported into a different world and found myself lost in the film's sheer beauty.  Furthermore, the mythical story is extremely complex, interweaving several themes & variations of the central plot.  The audience gradually discovers the truth of this film and it continued to surprise me throughout its length.<br /><br />I am not sure why so many people did not like this film.  I can only guess that they were expecting a pure-action film with Jet Li taking on a country, "Rambo" style.  I, for one, am happy that we were treated to something more.  HERO has plot, heart, emotion, and style.  And let us not forget the outstanding action it does provide: the action sequences in this film are some of the best ever captured on film.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

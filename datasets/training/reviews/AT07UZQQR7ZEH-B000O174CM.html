<meta name="summary" content="A model of how to brilliantly film a Broadway musical"></head><body><p>As a drama major in college, I bemoan the fact that roadshow versions of Broadway musicals are too damned expensive nowadays, especially when souvenir booklets and sweatshirts are factored in.  So I am grateful when an Oscar-winning writer/director like Bill Condon (GODS AND MONSTERS, CHICAGO) decides to lavishly film a Tony winner, like 1981's DREAMGIRLS.  It's a fabulous, glittering three-ring circus of a movie, with a strong script, stunning performances by three extraordinary African-American singers (Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson as Effie, Beyonce Knowles as Deena, and Anika Noni Rose as Lorrell), and dazzling theatrical lighting by Jules Fisher and Peggy Eisenhauer (Tobias Schliesser is cinematographer).  It's a gem of a musical that, at a running time of 130 minutes and with twelve almost non-stop songs, has to be pretty close to the stage original.  And if some songs have been shortened, I did not notice.<br /><br />With lyrics by Tom Eyen, music by Henry Krieger, and choreography inspired by  Michael Bennett, DREAMGIRLS is loosely based on the rise and fall of the Supremes.  Effie, Deena, and Lorrell are here called The Dreams, and Jamie Foxx as Curtis Taylor is their arrogant manager.  He is not afraid to walk all over people in mid-1960's Detroit when the more talented Effie is put in the rear of the trio because Deena is more beautiful.  And Eddie Murphy (deservedly Oscar-nominated as James "Thunder" Early) never attracts a white crossover audience as a drug-addicted R&B lounge singer; he eventually dies of a heroin overdose.  We follow The Dreams all the way to Los Angeles around 1975 as they try to make it as black singers in mostly white middle America over fifteen years or so.  The finale is a stupendous and dazzling, ten-star, rock-the-house affair that leads in to ten minutes of closing credits to let us know that literally hundreds of talented people on both sides of the camera helped bring this beloved stage musical to the screen as a razzle-dazzle affair.<br /><br />The version of DREAMGIRLS that I bought is the "2-disk Showstopper Edition", and they aren't kidding.  Disk one with the movie includes extended versions of all twelve musical numbers, a special cutting room floor Jennifer Hudson number, and a Beyonce music video.  And a mammoth disk 2 includes a full 2 hour documentary on creating both the stage musical and the movie step by step 25 years apart; auditions and screen tests; and individual featurettes on the dazzling lighting, creating the costumes, doing the editing, and many more technical shorts.  It should keep you out of trouble and humming happily for days on end.<br /><br />For once, new Hollywood has improved on old Hollywood by showing how to transfer an award-winning stage musical to the screen brilliantly and successfully.  DREAMGIRLS is a giddy and exhilarating knockout.  And, yes, it should have been an Oscar nominee for Picture and Director, though it got plenty of other nominations.  Like the brilliant LITTLE CHILDREN, also shut-out for Picture and Director, it will be fun to see what movies from 2006 people are still raving about in ten or twenty years.  By the way, do see DREAMGIRLS in wide-screen format for its Panavision images.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

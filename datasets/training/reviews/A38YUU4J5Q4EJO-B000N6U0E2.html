<meta name="summary" content="Uplifting and very Inspirational...and TRUE !"></head><body><p>I really think this movie is the best that Will Smith has done, and I liked that his real life Son played his Son in the movie.<br /><br />The movie is based on a true story of a man who was dealt more than his share of bad luck, grief,burdens and poverty.<br /><br />Nothing just seems to go his way at all. His wife gets tired of the daily struggle to make ends meet, and she leaves him alone to raise his Son on a meager salary, and times just keep getting tougher for him.<br /><br />They continue to move down in the world instead of up, and finally, they are homeless, and have to stand in a line every night to get a bed in a homeless shelter. It is so very sad, and you really feel for these characters!<br /><br />Things begin to change however, when he sees what stockbroker's make, and gets into a competetive internship, where out of 20 people, only one will make it. While he is studying for this, He not only has the pressure of work, but has raising his Son to deal with.<br /><br />Of course all his ambition pays off, and it is a joy to see things turn around for him-FINALLY!!!<br /><br />This is really a movie to cheer about.I am sure if you see this that you will love it! It is Will Smith at his very best, and in the most tender role I have ever seen him in!</p></body></html>

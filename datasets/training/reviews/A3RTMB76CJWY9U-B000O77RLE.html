My fiancee and I were relegated to the very, very front seats--the ones no one sits in--to the far right of the auditorium. We were probably less than ten feet from the screen. It was then that we discovered that the entire film was in subtitles; my fiancee later commented that we had to create our own "Pan and Scan" to watch the film. Consider also: 2 and a half hours long. My neck was aching from about minute 10.<br /><br />And yet...<br /><br />I really enjoyed the movie. At 2 1/2 hours, it never felt long. I didn't regret being so close, usually enough to make any movie unbearably awkward. This is a smart, powerful film, engrossing from start to finish, and it made me lose myself to my surroundings, to join with the soldiers striving to defend their homes on a poor island in the Pacific.<br /><br />Specifically, it's the story of the battle of Iwo Jima from the point of view of the Japanese, and of the commander who had to wage an impossible battle. Against the American forces? Perhaps, but really the impossible battle was against his own troops and culture, which were of a tradition-bound mentality that severely tied his hands.<br /><br />Beyond war, it's also a human story, as the "letters" give us background on several of the players, and show us how the Japanese soldiers in that army were every bit as individualistic as anyone else, despite serving a society that strove to deny the individual.<br /><br />In many ways, this is a bleak film, served up in a suiting palette of muted greys and browns (the movie almost appears black and white, at times). It is sad, because we know ahead of time what the result will be for the Japanese that we grow to like over the course of the tale, but within it are moments of bravery, heroism and friendship.<br /><br />I'm glad for movies like this--to show us the humanity of other peoples, times and cultures, and even ones that were, once, our "enemies." Clint Eastwood handles this difficult subject with style and respect, and delivers an emotional, enveloping tale of men pushed to their brink.<br /><br />Wonderful movie. Five stars.</p></body></html>

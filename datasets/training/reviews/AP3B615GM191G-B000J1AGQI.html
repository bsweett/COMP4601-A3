<meta name="summary" content="The "Saving Private Ryan" of Vietnam"></head><body><p>When Steven Spielberg released Saving Private Ryan in 1998, it set the new standard for epic war films.  We Were Soldiers uses some of those same effects/devices to tell a compelling Vietnam War story.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, We Were Soldiers tells the story of one of the first Vietnam battles.  It follows the First Battalion, 7th Cavalry division through their training, deployment, and improbably "victory" (depending on your perspective) in that seminal battle.<br /><br />Strangely, this film doesn't stand out much on its own accord (it doesn't do anything all that original).  However, it does enough things right to make for a very enjoyable, emotional experience.<br /><br />Mel Gibson shines as the lead actor, Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore, whose primary goal is to bring "his boys" back to the mainland alive.  In fact, this is one of the best roles I've ever seen Gibson in, far better than the action-hero roles he often fancies himself in.  The other members of the battalion are also well-cast and peppered with great actors.<br /><br />However, this film is at its best when it tugs at your heartstrings, which it does frequently.  Whether it is the physical  @#!*%  of the soldiers in the field, or the mental  @#!*%  of their wives/families back home, this movie really "gets" the emotions of that time period.  Plus, it really does a good job of foreshadowing the rest of the drawn-out conflict.<br /><br />Thus, whereas First Blood is best in my book at examining the mental torments of 'Nam, We Were Soldiers touches on those same emotions but also adds the epic battle scenes.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Concept Film That Also Wows With Action"></head><body><p>Imagine if you could be charged & arrested for a crime you were ABOUT to commit?  That is the premise behind Steven Spielberg's "Minority Report".<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, the film (set in the future) focuses on John Anderton (Tom Cruise), chief of the highly successful "Pre-Crime" unit, which (with help from three special pre-cognizants) are able to predict a murder BEFORE it occurs, rendering the crime rate almost nil.  However, Anderton suddenly finds himself the target of a pre-crime investigation, and embarks on a crusade to prove his innocence...which in itself is in doubt until the shocking conclusion.<br /><br />In terms of plot, the film excellently delivers a high-concept topic in a way that both creates high drama and gets you thinking about the possibility of such events actually occurring.  At its heart, "Minority Report" is a concept film, but one in which the events are portrayed (thanks to Spielberg) in such a linear, easy-to-understand manner that it actually feels like an action-adventure epic.<br /><br />The acting, with Cruise leading the way, is also entertaining, as Cruise plays a very convoluted Anderton.  On one hand, he believes in the PreCrime system with all his heart.  On the other, he grapples with the fact that he himself could be a casualty of that very system.<br /><br />About the only thing I didn't like about this film were some of the extended action scenes.  While flashy, in terms of real-ness they were much more suited for, say, a James Bond film.  In other words, a bit too fakey for my tastes.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great concept film that will keep you thinking, draw you into the characters, and keep you on the edge of your seat.  Creatively, I compare it to Blade Runner, although much better in terms of the action/adventure angle, whereas Blade Runner seems so bleak.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Renee Zellweger is amazing as Roxie Hart!"></head><body><p>Chicago is my second favorite musical right behind Grease. Renee Zellweger should have gotten the oscar for best actress for Chicago. Her acting is so vulnerable and fascinating, she is not like any other actress nowadays. Her singing is great, boy i was pleasantly surprised, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere are great as well. Fabulous dance numbers, catchy songs, and a superb directing job by Rob Marshall. The audio commentary is also very good. I love the numbers, All that Jazz, Cell Block Tango, and Roxie. It is fast paced, has a solid storyline, and excellent tap dance number by Gere. Get this movie today, it will have you dancing like a nutcase, but a stylish nutcase.</p></body></html>

Although well acted with good direction, the film lags in its rather predictable plot and suffers from uninspiring action scenes.<br /><br />The film starts with the senseless mutilation of a prostitute in the town of Big Whiskey.  Anxious to keep the peace, Sheriff Little Bill Dagget (Gene Hackman) asks the perpetrator to compensate the victim with several horses.  Humiliated and permanently disfigured, the prostitute isn't happy with the offer and raises a bounty for the death of her attacker.  With news of the bounty, widowed Bill Munny (Clint Eastwood) leaves his family behind to get some badly needed money. A retired gunslinger left with a delapidated farm and a bleak future for his two children, Bill Munny returns to his life of sin one last time.  He soon joins up with his old friend Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) who's also leaving his reformed life for one final reward.  On their way to Big Whiskey, Munny and Logan are joined by The Shofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvet), a young hothead who also needs the reward. When the characters arrive in Big Whiskey, they run into gunslingers such as English Bob (Richard Harris)and the impatience of Sheriff Little Bill.  Wanting to keep the peace at all costs, the sheriff will do whatever it takes to keep hired guns out of Big Whiskey.  An unexpected incident leads to a final confrontation between the main characters.<br /><br />Eastwood attempts several things in this film with mixed success.  First, he attempts to break away from the reverse trends in westerns he himself helped form over 30 years before in Sergio Leone's action-packed films.  In those films, the West was depicted as a wasteland of shady characters who could be either villains or heroes depending on the reward: the theme was presented through symbolic action sequences as opposed to extended and unrealistic dialogues using action as only the filler scenes.  In this film, Eastwood sacrifices action for more character study found in some of the older westerns preceding Leone's: the main difference being that characters' motivations are treated with much more realism than those presented in such earlier films. In this film, Eastwood shows that all of the characters are flawed in various ways.  The bounty hunters don't really care if their cause is just as long as the reward is payed; they simply justify their motivations post factum.  The sheriff is a man with honest intentions and his actions, although perhaps varying between inadequate and extreme, are solely in the interests of the community.  All of the characters are victims of their environment who must cope with the realities they are presented with.  Even the actual victim in the film, the prostitute, is depicted as a person who suffered from the consequences of her own immoral profession as opposed to the actions of a deranged criminal.<br /><br />Although this is a good film, I found it to be overrated and  actually less creative than Clint Eastwood's other great western, 'The Outlaw Josey Wales.'  I felt that the latter actually had more character insight and thematic depth than this film even though it didn't have as many stars.  In his attempt to be more sober in portraying the real West, Clint Eastwood seemed to fall in the same trap as earlier westerns by drowning the plot in over-the-top character/psychological studies of people who, realistically, weren't the types to intellectualize things too much. Although I'm a big fan of Clint Eastwood's westerns, this is one which I haven't bothered to buy for the reasons cited: I think it tends to make a better rental.</p></body></html>

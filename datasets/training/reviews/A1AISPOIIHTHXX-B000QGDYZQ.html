It just looked like another unnecessary remake of what wasn't even a good Asian horror film in the first place. But let's face it, and I'm probably not the only guy that thinks so, but Hollywood likes familiarity. When certain films get successful, their thinking is "well the public probably wants more then". Well no, we don't want tons of remakes; we just want good movies and sadly to say, Premonition isn't one of them.<br /><br />Linda is a housewife married to Jim and has 2 daughters. One day, Linda receives the shock of her life when Jim dies in a brutal car accident en route to a business meeting. But strangely she wakes up the next day and finds out that he's actually still alive and hasn't even went on his trip yet. This continues as she wakes up and finds it a different day, husband's dead and every time she wakes up she's either seeing Jim still alive or long since dead. Can she change the future and save her husband's life?<br /><br />In the original, a man loses his wife and child in a car accident but finds it hasn't happened yet however he can also see other's deaths before they happen and even prevent his loss. Here, she's basically caught in a time warp that for some reason just likes to mess with her. It's never really explained right away why she has to experience a certain day before another but then when it is and we see how her knowledge of things helps her in other situations we don't really care since they're kind of distracting. Can she save him or not? That's the whole point but we see other vignettes such as a creepy psychiatrist, a blonde woman, scars on one of her daughter's faces that you feel like "come on already, get to the point."<br /><br />But this is a remake of a horror movie so in that basis: is the film scary? Well no, at times it's not even creepy. This is more a bad character study in how someone can grieve and experience traumatic events and whether you can change them so those of you looking for thrills and scares might look elsewhere. Of course sometimes certain screwy logic and an ever-changing timeline just makes kind of a mess of things.<br /><br />In Crash, Sandra Bullock did a more dramatic role but thanks to the awful, contrived dialogue she didn't really feel like a full character. Now, since practically every scene has her in it she can flex her muscles although you kind of wish someone else was in it since she's always been that fun gal from Speed and romantic comedies. Julian McMahon, who I really only know as Dr. Doom from Fantastic Four films, is good but he's kind of underutilized. And you can tell Peter Stormare is lazy casting; not that he's bad but he's always played off-center types from Fargo and Armageddon so casting him as a creepy doctor just felt like easy casting.<br /><br />Should you rent it? No. There are far better movies out there but if you have to absolutely see it, try it but I doubt you'll like it.</p></body></html>

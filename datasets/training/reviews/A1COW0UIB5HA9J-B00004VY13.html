<meta name="summary" content="The ultimate in Sci-fi/horror!"></head><body><p>In Antartica, a group of researchers (Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, Keith David, Richard A. Dystrat, Charles Hallahan, Thomas Waites, Joel Polis, Richard Mauser, Donald Moffat, T.K. Carter and David Clennon) discovered an old spaceship that was buried in the snow for thousands of years. A parasitic shape-shifting creature has been thawed out as it hides inside a few of the team members for paranoia starts and those that might be The Thing.<br /><br />An electrifying and shocking brilliant remake of a 1951 Sci-fi/horror classic thanks to director John Carpenter of "Halloween" fame. The film has a talented all-guy cast including Kurt Russell as RJ McCready and lovable Quaker-Oats commercial fellow Wilford Brimley (Without his famed Mustache). The film was a box-office and critical bust upon it's release and was rediscovered later on DVD, Cable and VHS with now being reguarded as the ultimate remake. It's more true to the original story "Who Goes There" by Joseph Campbell then the 1951 movie and the special effects are still shocking yet amazing even in these days of CGI all done by Rob Bottin and Stan Winston. The film is also about survival and paranoia as this is John Carpenter's second best movie besides "Halloween".<br /><br />This DVD offers a mind-blowing transfer of sound and picture in the highest quality possible even on Blu-Ray and the extras are terrific like audio commentary, an 80 minute documentary on this film, deleted Stop Motion scene from the film that was cut out, exclusive behind the scenes footage, outtakes, Trailer, behind-the-scenes location footage, storyboards and conceptual art, and annonated production achieve.</p></body></html>

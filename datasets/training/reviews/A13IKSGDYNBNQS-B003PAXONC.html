<meta name="summary" content="Better than expected"></head><body><p>This is the 3rd version of Richard Mathieson's story 'I Am Legend', and this easily holds its own as compared with 'The Omega Man' (Charlton Heston) and 'Last Man On Earth' (Vincent Price). I really wasn't expecting that much from the film. Obviously Will Smith was always going to be the films saviour even if it was a complete Turkey. But its not.<br /><br />I agree with most previous reviewers that the first half is the best part of the film. However IMO the 2nd half and the special effects are nowhere near as bad as some reviewers have made out. Only at one point in the film did I think "thats CGI". Will Smith is very good and the errie deserted streets and his relationship with the dog are very well done.<br /><br />The film is only 96 mins long, which is also in its favour. Unlike a lot of Hollywood blockbusters this doesn't feel like it should have much, if anything cut from it. Most crucially of all, Neville (Will Smith) was a sympathetic character. This film has that crucial element that is missing from so many bloated blockbusters - characters you care about.<br /><br />On the downside there are a few contrived moments in the plot that I didn't really believe in. To some extent I agree with previous reviewers criticisms about the ending, but in the end the filmmakers just about got the balance between a completely happy ending and a resolutely downbeat one. Without actually giving away what happens at the end I can't say anymore than that.<br /><br />This isn't quite 4 stars for me but its better than 3 and I recommend it.</p></body></html>

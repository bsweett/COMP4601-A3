<meta name="summary" content="Pretty Damn good"></head><body><p>For those who are well-versed in voodoo and hoodoo cultures and spells, then this movie will have no surprises for you.  The "shock ending" you will be able to surmise from about 20 minutes into the film.  The rest of us will probably be in the dark.  I know the ending would have surprised me had I not had someone who took a course in voodoo/hoodoo and who preceeded to explain to me how the movie would most likely end.<br /><br />Also in reference to the ending, a couple professional reviewers (Roger Ebert for example) have said that the ending makes little sense as you think about it.  True, it might not make sense to people not versed in hoodoo culture, but as I said in the previous paragraph, it makes perfect sense when you think about the myths surrounding hoodoo.  So, don't believe those reviewers who apparently don't know much about that particular culture.  According to my friend, the movie does a pretty decent job incorporating it into the movie.  Of course its sensationalized and reel-ified but the things that happen in the movie are considered parts of the hoodoo culture.<br /><br />That said, The Skeleton Key does a good job mixing the typical ghost story with voodoo culture.  As you learn through the movie, there is a difference between voodoo (a religion) and hoodoo (spells and incantations).  Kate Hudson's Caroline will also learn this as she decides to take care of an elderly man (John Hurt from Alien) who is dying and his wife who needs help.  The story moves from there and if you don't know much about it, I would recommend not learning anything else about it.<br /><br />The acting is, of course, pretty good from John Hurt to Gena Rowland.  Kate Hudson does her thing and actually does a good job playing an atypical romantic lead.  The atmosphere is also done really well with the creepy swamps and the house accentuating the mood.  Unfortunately, for a scary movie and one by Ehren Krueger of Ring fame, the Skeleton Key isn't too scary.  There are a couple jump out moments (in which the camera stays close to Kate Hudson and then moves quickly as someone you're not expecting appears in the scene) but, atmosphere aside, is not that creepy.<br /><br />However, considering some of the poor choices we have had for pg-13 horror films recently (Ring 2, Cursed, Boogeyman, Darkness et al) and some lamer rated R movies (Alone in the Dark and Hide and Seek for example) Skeleton Key does a good job of incorporating a good story with a classic ghost story concept.  I think what I appreciated the most was the lack of CG.  After the deluge of CG created horror, this movie hearkens back to movies like The Others where the mood and terror and, overall, a good story wins over special effects.<br /><br />Not the best, but pretty damn good.  And Kudos for doing a decent job with the subject matter.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great film, but minus the most fascinating factors..."></head><body><p>Sofia Coppola has created quite an interesting film about Marie Antoinette.  She has mixed a story based on the life of this fascinating historical figure with modern rock music and that seems to make parallels with Marie Antoiniette's life with that of modern-day celebrities.  After all, she was quite frivolous at some point -- spending astronomical amounts of money on jewelry and clothes, having lavish parties and being the focus of vicious gossip (like the whole, "Let them eat cake!" misquote).  When put into that context, I suppose Marie Antoinette's life was not all that different from a famous person from the 21st century.  This film does paint a more sympathetic look into the young queen's life with her struggles with giving King Louis XVI's an heir.  This film implies that he had been the one to blame, for he had no sexual appetite, but it was never proven whose fault it was, or if indeed there was someone to blame.  Historically, it does address some of the things the queen went through -- like having to relinquish her Austrian roots, getting dressed every morning by her ladies-in-waiting, the king's insatiable appetite for food, and many of the things that led to the French Revolution.  However, this film felt extremely rushed at the end and I didn't like the fact that there was nothing shown about her tragic demise when she was beheaded for supposedly committing treason. That is not to say that the film isn't great.  Kirsten Dunst did a wonderful job with the title role.  She brought in Marie's innocent and frivolous side as well as the more human, vulnerable side.  I was impressed with her delivery.  The film is also a feast for the eyes.  I loved the period costumes and the scenery.  I love everything about the 18th century except for the men's powdered wigs.  Marie Antoinette is an artful film that takes some rather risky artistic license that manage to work well with the overall tone.  However, I would have liked to see more of her during the last stages of her life.  I know this isn't a biopic in the classic sense, but I nevertheless would have liked to see how this interesting woman's story translated into film.  The DVD is okay.  I'd say rent it before you decide to buy it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What An Amazing Twist"></head><body><p>I popped Oldboy into my DVD player expecting to see a pretty decent movie but I got something way past that. First do not buy this film expecting to see a martial arts or action packed film because this is not packed it's just the right amount to keep you interested. There's more torture than fighting as you see Oh dae-su seek the ultimate revenge after being kidnapped and held for 15 years and then for some crazy reason he's let go.<br /><br /> By this time your probably thinking Oh dae-su has some bit of control over his life after being released but his napper tells him different. Whenever Oh dae-su thinks he's getting some control he is pulled back like a dog on a leash. He figures out he has not really been released just let out for some air. The napper tells Oh dae-su he released him because he wanted him to know why this was done to him and who did it and he only had 5 days to do so. You think you know who's getting the revenge but you don't really know.<br /><br />This film surpasses anything your thinking about it and the twist makes it worth every penny. I actually jokingly guessed the twist before it came and had the biggest jaw drop ever when I found out I was right, that's how unbelievable the twist is.<br />This film is so unique that you have to see it because there is no way you can find a twist in a movie in America like the one in Oldboy so get ready to be surprised. The actors are on the next level in this violent masterpiece and stop at nothing to make the film perfect. Don't watch this if you have a weak stomach.</p></body></html>

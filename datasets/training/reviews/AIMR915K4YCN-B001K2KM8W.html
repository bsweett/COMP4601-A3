After all, it is rated R, and billed as an ADULT fantasy / thriller. Consequently, I realized that I wasn't going to see THE NEVERENDING STORY 3 or FREE WILLY 10. What I wasn't prepared for was just how wonderful this movie actually is. Guillermo del Toro (The Devil's Backbone, Hellboy) takes us into a real, living nightmare, in the form of war and the evil men who profit by it. Within this hellish world, a girl named Ofelia (along w/ her ailing, pregnant mother) is forced to live w/ her stepfather, a spanish captain in Franco's fascist army. Ofelia's mind splits off into the safety of her imagination, allowing her to live her life as a girl on a mystical quest, rather than as a prisoner. She enters a stone labyrinth on the captain's property, leading to a spiral staircase, taking her down into the bowels of the earth below. Ofelia meets a faun (a goat-headed chap) who tells her of her past and her destiny. He also gives her a magical book and three tasks to accomplish. Reality and fantasy smear together as Ofelia's adventure becomes increasingly horrific. While Ofelia's stepfather murders the leftists he detests, and her mother grows weaker, Ofelia must accept greater challenges in her dreamworld, including the amazingly terrifying "baby-eater" monster! This thing is one of the best critters I've seen since HELLRAISER! Very disturbing to look at! I wouldn't want it coming after me! Ofelia draws on strengths she is unaware of, and overcomes ordeals that would cause most adults to wilt. I found PAN'S LABYRINTH thoroughly engrossing in it's use of imagery and symbolism to bring reality and nightmare together. I was afraid for Ofelia both in this world and the netherworld. Still, I found the ultimate message of life after death / good overcoming evil to be uplifting. Nope, this isn't G-rated family fare. However, it is a tremendous morality tale for grown-ups...  P.S.- I recommend watching THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE first, to get an idea of del Toro's style and use of dark fantasy...</p></body></html>

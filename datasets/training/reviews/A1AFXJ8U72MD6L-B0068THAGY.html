<meta name="summary" content="SOMEWHAT GOOD BUT I EXPECTED MORE"></head><body><p>Set in the 70s and focused on a group of kids making a zombie movie who stumble upon something they weren't meant to know. The characters are nicely fleshed out and there's a definite sense of melancholy and even poignancy at times. In fact, I'd say the characters are the best part about this movie. The introduction of the alien and the ending resolution feels half baked, though. The end credits was done nicely. This film cost $50M to make and yielded close to $260M at the Box Office. A great deal of the advertising of this film early on was done through viral marketing.<br /><br />CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: C plus; RESONANCE: B; CGI: B; WHEN WATCHED: early December 2011; OVERALL GRADE: B</p></body></html>

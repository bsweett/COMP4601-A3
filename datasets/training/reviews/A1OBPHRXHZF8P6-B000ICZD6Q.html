<meta name="summary" content="Downsizing never looked so good until this movie"></head><body><p>This movie will be the blocbuster of 2005. Topher Grace (best known as Eric Foreman on 'That 70's show' stretches his acting chops. He plays the youthfull boss of a reccently demoted salesperson, Dan Foreman (Dennis Quaid).<br /><br />As Carter Dureya, Grace plays an uber-kid. Having no use for the 'old-fashioned' business handshake, he instead promotes products through each other. Grace does a wonderful job portraying somebody who although very smart is still learning about life.<br /><br />After being dumped by his wife of seven months, Dureya inexplicably goes after the subordinate's daughter. Already unerved about the one-two impact of his boss's young age and his wife Ann (Marg Helgenberger)'s late-life pregnancy, Dan must now deal with the even-more uncomfortable idea of his daughter dating his own boss.<br /><br />Confronting this boyfriend when they stay out late...etc would be very difficult. This plot twist creates all kind of innovative perspectives.<br /><br />What could have ended up being either a cheesy teen flick or a cheesy grown up soap fest is instead an enjoyable feature for many age ranges. Youth will flock to see Grace and his romance, their parents and others will be drawn in from familiarity with downsizing.</p></body></html>

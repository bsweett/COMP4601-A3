<meta name="summary" content="Three Generations Of My Family LOVED This Film"></head><body><p>I was lucky enough to see HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 with three generations of Harry Potter fans:  my mother, my sister, and my 18 year old nephew (who shall remain nameless since he deigned to be seen in public with three older women in his family!).  All four of us really, really enjoyed the film, and we had a great time discussing it afterwards.  All of us agreed that HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 is the best adaptation, truest to the novel, in quite sometime.<br /><br />HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 is the first part of the final Harry Potter novel of the same name.  The Death Eaters are taking over, and Volemort is back in power.  The wizarding world is still reeling from the death of Dumbledore, and Harry Potter is essentially public enemy number one.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione are on the run and looking the remaining horcruxes.  If Harry can destroy all the remaining horcuxes, he will finally have a chance of destroying Voldemort for good.<br /><br />My nephew stated that HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 is the best screen play adaptation of a Harry Potter novel to date, and the rest of my family agrees.  While none of us believe that you can go into this movie cold, without having read the books or seen the previous 6 films, we all agree that if you are a fan, you will love this movie.  This book was one of my favorites of the series, and the film version is right up there for me, too. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint continue to delight us as Harry, Hermione, Ron.  These actors perfectly portray these three beloved and endearing characters, and I, for one, can't imagine Harry, Hermione, and Ron any other way.  These kids have grown up on the screen, their talent developed and matured, and I have enjoyed their journey.  Rupert Grint is especially notable in his jelous, horcrux-induced rage, and the "dream scene" between Harry and Hermione is well done, and quite uncomfortable (as it should be).  Some of the scenery is stunning, as well as quite atmospheric.  The long shots of the deep woods and empty plains expertly conveyed a true sense of cold, longing, defeat, and loneliness.  The emotions of this film run high, as friends are injured and some die.  And of course, there is a cliff hanger ending, since this is only the first half of the final book.<br /><br />HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1 does exactly what it needs to do:  whets our appetites for the final installments  I know I can't wait until July.  The final movie promises to be the best yet.<br /><br />Side note:  As we were driving to see HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, PART 1, it occured to me that my nephew was about 9 years old when the first film openned, and now he is 18 and driving US to this film.  He and a whole generation of kids really have grown up with the Harry Potter books and movies.  It is wonderful to see that even after all this time, Harry Potter still captures the hearts and imaginations of millions of children of ALL ages.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Monkey Business"></head><body><p>A bland, generic, corporate-motivated PG-13 near-dud of a movie.  I never saw the 1968 original with Charlton Heston, but it had to be infinitely better than this mess.  The DVD, from what I understand, is a well-assembled package, but a mediocre movie is still a mediocre movie.  Proceed with caution.</p></body></html>

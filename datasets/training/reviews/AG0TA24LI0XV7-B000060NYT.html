<meta name="summary" content="Fun Stuff"></head><body><p>This is a fun time at the movies... especially the first part of the film.<br /><br />But after a wonderful beginning, it does fizzle. The plot gets nonsensical and they show WAY too much of the monster. Should have taken a page from the first 'Alien' or from 'Jaws'.<br /><br />It's no slasher flick, so pass if that's you're style. This is a nod to those simple but suspenseful horror films of the 70's (Duel comes to mind, as does Race With the Devil). And this movie includes a big amount of Alfred Hitchcock suspense, with a dash of tongue-in-cheek humor thrown in.<br /><br />There are plot holes, yes... but there's no perfect scary film, really. And there are a couple of those cheap "jump" moments (you know, when there's a loud sting of music as a character pops into view out of nowhere; it's been done to absolute death in so many horror films, it's the biggest dead horse in Hollywood, and I wish directors and writers would stop that once and for all).<br /><br />And yet I've got to give this movie credit for a few terrific things, including but not limited to: the realistic presentation of the siblings on a road trip in Florida, the discovery of something very creepy, and what the brother finds underground. These things alone were really done nicely. I wish I had seen this in the movie theater instead of on dvd.</p></body></html>

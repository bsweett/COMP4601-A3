<meta name="summary" content="The Remake That's Better Than the Original"></head><body><p>If you have fond memories of Ray Harryhausen's 1981 version, you owe it to yourself to see what 30 years of technological advances have done for adventure movies involving fantastic monsters. They're fantastic!<br /><br />No doubt you know the story by now, although this version has some interesting twists. Perseus (Sam Worthington) is a demi-god: Zeus (Liam Neeson) was his father by a human mother. A queen, in fact. Zeus disguised himself as her husband and . . . Well, anyway, Perseus was raised by a fisherman and his family who were killed when some uppity soldiers tore down a statue of Zeus.<br /><br />Hades (Ralph Fiennes, who also played Lord Voldemort) gets angry at how uppity the humans are getting, and tells his brother Zeus he will teach them humility. He points out that while Zeus feeds on the humans' prayers and love, Hades lives on their fear.<br /><br />Anyway, Hades threatens to unleash the Kraken, a huge horrible monster, who can only be placated by the sacrifice of Princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos), while Perseus has concluded that it is his destiny to slay the Kraken. But first he needs to defeat Medusa (Natalia Vodianova).<br /><br />He's not entirely alone, but the soldiers he took with him all seem to be pretty expendable. He has a guardian goddess, Io (Gemma Arterton), and a magical sword from Zeus that he refuses to use until the last minute, and the invaluable aid of Pegasus. Oddly, in this version Pegasus is the only black winged horse in the herd; I'm used to his being white.<br /><br />It's rousing thrill-a-minute adventure, not too gory for the older kids, and refreshingly realistic compared to the stop-action techniques of Harryhausen. There are several extra characters, one whole group of which I won't tell you about because their appearance on the scene is a surprise, as is their role in the story. If you love mythology, you'll love this movie.</p></body></html>

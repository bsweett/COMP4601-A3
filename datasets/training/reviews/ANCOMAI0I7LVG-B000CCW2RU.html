<meta name="summary" content="Action film that covers all the bases and delivers a well rounded theatrical experience..."></head><body><p>The concept behind `The Island' is one that, despite claims of forgery, is quite impressive.  In fact, with the initial concept the script could really have gone one of three ways.  It could have been worked into a thinking man's film, ala `Children of Men' and really been at the head of the Oscar race.  It could have become a strategically executed action film in the vein of, well just about every other Michael Bay film or it could have fallen flat of expectations and really dissolved all potential.  `The Island' decided to take the middle road, and while I would have loved to see this concept taken a little more seriously I can't complain about the outcome.  `The Island' may very well be Michael Bay's best film, although `Armageddon' is still stupendous in my opinion.  Aside from a brilliant synopsis, `The Island' also sports some mind-blowing special effects and some sincere and unexpected performances, especially when you take the genre into account.  Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson are two brilliant actors and so casting them in this brand of action film was a smart idea.  This film is more than just your typical `blow stuff up' action film for it has heart and moral and emotions and getting two actors who are capable of pulling that off was essential.  I really don't care what others may say, Scarlett Johansson is above and beyond our finest young actress working today.  Anyone who disagrees is just jealous in my opinion.<br /><br />So I'm ranting and raving about this concept and still I've really said nothing about it.  Well here it goes.  The Island itself is the last livable surface upon the Earth, a beautiful and serene garden where only a select few have the chance of dwelling.  In fact, all of Earth's remaining survivors of the `contamination' are dwelling within a facility completely sealed off from the outside world.  Here they await their selection (via lottery) to leave the facility for life on the island.  The truth behind this though is that these so-called survivors are not even human.  No, the place in which they dwell is not holding grounds for human survivors but a breeding ground for human clones, clones contained and harvested for spare parts.  The lottery selecting the `survivor' heading to `the island' is really sending the selected clone to his or her deathbed as they're essentially murdered and dissected so their human sponsors can live on.<br /><br />The clones are oblivious to the real goings on of the facility, but they have their speculations and questions that continue to go unanswered.  There is one clone in particular though that has more than a few questions and theories.  Lincoln Six Echo is suffering from strange dreams of a past he can't quite remember.  When he oversees an act of violence that raises a few flags and explains a few concerns he quickly puts the pieces together to realize that this island is not the promised paradise but a reward not worth attaining.  When the lovely Jordan Two Delta is selected to leave he has to work fast to save her life, putting his own in danger.  With the help of an employee to the facility, McCord, both Lincoln and Jordan escape and enter the real world, a world which they know nothing of.  They are soon pursued by bounty hunters while they struggle to find their sponsors in an effort to attain their freedom.  They journey is harrowing, exciting and intense.<br /><br />The action sequences are astonishing and beautiful to watch and the chemistry between McGregor and Johansson is phenomenal.  The rest of the cast is also well rounded.  Steve Buscemi is fine as McCord.  He has this way about him that makes him almost an essential actor, like any other actor wouldn't do.  My wife hates him but I think he's greatly unappreciated.  Sean Bean is fantastic as the villain Merrick.  He plays a good brand of evil.  Djimon Hounsou is one of my favorite new actors (well, not really `new' but `newer') and here he does a fine job.  In fact his performance as bounty hunter Albert Laurent effortlessly portrays the emotions needed for the pivotal role.  I really want to see this actor shine in years to come.  He's displayed the ability to (in films like `Gladiator' and `In America') but he's also been embraced for less impressive performances (ala `Blood Diamond') so hopefully he'll settle down on perfection and move forward from there.<br /><br />One performance I wanted to mention was Michael Clarke Duncan's only because it's so short yet so brilliant.  The act of violence Lincoln Six Echo sees involves the murder of Duncan's character Starkweather, and his performance therein is phenomenal.<br /><br />So, there is a lot of good to look forward to when watching `The Island'.  It's a brilliantly orchestrated science fiction action film that lives up to Michael Bay's name, but it also features some warm and textured performances that help aid in the emotional relevancy of the material.  Sure, it could have gone another route and maybe have been technically a `better' film, but it surely excels in the route is takes and for that we can all be thankful.</p></body></html>

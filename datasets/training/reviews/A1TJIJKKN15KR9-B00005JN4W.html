<meta name="summary" content="Pixar's Masterpiece Does Everything Right"></head><body><p>The standard-bearer of excellence for the Pixar animation house has aged well in the seven years since its release, and it should be no surprise. With a clever, all-ages sense of humor, a masterfully paced storyline, wonderfully rounded characters and genuinely perfect casting, the filmmakers have left little cause for concern. Spotted throughout with nods, winks and nudges of all shapes and sizes for the dedicated comic book fans that are bound to be in the audience, the plot remains easily-accessible for those who may have never even seen a funny book. On top of that, its excellent sense of timing and regular ability to one-up itself is more than enough to ensure no eyeballs wander far from the center of the screen. The perfect family film, it's also something I have no shame over watching repeatedly by my lonesome. Looks even better than I remembered in brilliant Blu-Ray quality.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""The Phoenix...""></head><body><p>Based on the heroes from Marvel comics, X-Men is a wonderful sci-fi film, which brings to the screen the struggle for supremacy between two rival groups of mutants while an undeclared state of war with the humans looms in the background.<br /><br />X-Men-The Last Stand picks up where the second movie, X2-X-Men, left off, with the government having found a cure for the mutations.  Will this revelation finally bring peace or will full-out war break out?<br /><br />Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Famke Janssen, Halle Berry, Rebecca Romijn (three of the most GORGEOUS women out there!), and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!<br /><br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues and the music are all out of this world!<br /><br />My only question is what happened to Kurt Wagner from X2-X-Men?  He was great!<br /><br />In short, X-Men-The Last Stand is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  KEEP'EM COMING!!!</p></body></html>

The independent film that critics and movie lovers in general loved so much but never got the public attention or the award recognition that it probably deserved? This wasn't so much a big deal for Newmarket, the studio that distributed the film, since the film went on to make nearly three times its budget but this has to be somewhat upsetting for the filmmakers who wanted more from their work but life goes on. The director of Memento, who is currently in the works with the new Batman project, went on to a new film called Insomnia, based on a Norwegian film of the same name. What makes this film interesting is the casting of certain roles within the film. No, its not just Al Pacino, though he does add some flavor of dramatic talent to the film, it's the casting of Robin Williams as the killer. Williams, who is best known for his comedic performances in Popeye, Aladdin and Hook, isn't the first choice that comes to mind in this area but if it works, the film could spawn a cult status on the same level as Memento.<p>The story centers on the investigation of a murder in Alaska and the cat and mouse game that the killer instigates with one of the detectives. When a teenage girl is found murdered in a small town in Alaska, a veteran police detective and his partner are sent up to over-see an official investigation. Just as the two close in on the primary suspect of the murder, the veteran detective accidentally kills his partner in a chase, believing he was the murderer. The detective then lies about the accidental homicide and gets away with it. But he soon finds out that he isn't the only living soul who saw it happen. The murderer calls up the detective, who is racked with guilt, and plans to blackmail him into letting him go free. Now the veteran police detective must choose what means more to him, his life or his commitment to justice. The story for Insomnia does a wonderful job at dealing with conflicts of the human psyche when it comes to guilt but wasn't as surprising as Memento was. But this is a small issue as it is hard to follow up to such a critical success was that film was with many critics.<p>Though the cast of Insomnia represents a wide range of actors and actresses from different performance backgrounds, it doesn't change the fact that they work perfectly together. Al Pacino in the role of the veteran detective brings the film a sense of seniority, which is a good thing in this case, and plays the character perfectly all the way to the end. He showcases a man truly racked with guilt in such a way that it allows his character to really connect with audience members without giving the end to the feature away. Even though it may seem a weird choice for the role of the killer, Robin Williams gives an impressive performance in this film. The veteran comedian seems to be really be adding up his dramatic performances with roles in other adult-oriented features like One Hour Photo and Death to Smoochy and adds to his impressive resume that includes an Oscar winning performance in Good Will Hunting. Hilary Swank, as good as she could have been in this film, isn't given much, in the area of material, that allows her to really expand her acting ability.<p>Overall, despite lack the suspense and the surprising twists of its predecessor, Memento, Christopher Nolan gives an impressive follow-up with Insomnia that stands above most cop thrillers. The problems lie in the feature's time-length, which felt longer then it should have been, and its pacing, which seemed dragged down in certain areas. The lack of usable material for smaller characters with the film, like Hilary Swank, was a shame in there was a lot of potential for several enjoyable performances but nothing developed. Other then that, Insomnia gives an engaging view into the human psyche and the effects of guilt on the subconscious combined with amazing dramatic performances from Al Pacino and Robin Williams.</p></body></html>

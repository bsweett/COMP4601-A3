This movie has everything that makes a sci-fi fan drool; a great story mixed with funny characters, cool sets and fantastic looking aliens. Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith definitely make the movie work as they argue between each other. Watching the movie, you can tell that this was either going to be a major blockbuster or a major disaster. I have seen this movie at least ten times and it still hasn't lost its charm. If you have never seen this movie, then this is definitely a must see. It is a really fun movie with everything that you would want out of a movie, including a great soundtrack.</p></body></html>

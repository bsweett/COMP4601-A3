This is a fun movie to watch, a bit happens in the early 20th century, but most of the story happens in the future and revolves around a cab driver and this weird girl called Leeloo and their quest to save the world by looking for the physical representations of the four elements and keeping them out of the hands of the bad guys. There's some messages here about the environment and war, so this isn't just some pretty film to watch.</p></body></html>

This nifty little thriller from David Mamet doesn't stop to explain everything to the audience but just takes off and unfolds, filling in the blanks as it zips along.<p>Val Kilmer is restrained and contained, playing an icy specialist in the netherworld of &quot;Special Ops&quot;:the nexus between the military and intelligence, political and pragmatic, public and covert arenas.  It is one of his better performances.<p>This self-described &quot;worker bee&quot; finds himself drawn into a situation that demands he go &quot;off the reservation&quot; to question his orders and those giving them for perhaps the first time in his life.  There are many twists and turns along the way, and Mamet keeps it moving along with his trademark cryptic dialogue and his fascination with the competence and ultimate grace of the &quot;professional&quot;.<p>Noting some of the critical reviews, I would agree that he does not break startling new ground here.  I don't think that was Mamet's intent.  I think he wanted to make a crisp thriller and explore again the world of men and women who, as mentioned before, are skilled and adept in their chosen fields, whatever they might be (thieves or spies or salesmen).  He did so, in a film that didn't waste time and kept me entertained from beginning to end.  Worth a look.</p></body></html>

They are:<p>1.  To quench the appetite of those Raimi-files not sated by the gore-and-goofiness of "The Evil Dead" and "The Evil Dead II":<p>Yes, it's pretty gory:  A fire hose caliber spray of blood erupts from a torture pit; an evil deadite appears to have no lips or skin; animated skeletons get run over by a beat up yellow Oldsmobile.  But thankfully, it is also very goofy: the arms of buried bodies poke through the ground to perform a neatly choreographed Three Stooges routine; an army of mini-Bruce Campbells appears, and attack their Gulliver-sized doppelganger, Lilliputian-style; an evil witch is blown to pieces by a double-barreled department store shotgun, as the audience gets the bullets'-eye-view.  The meshing of gore and goof is a Raimi trademark, and it is in no small supply here.  Prepare to hold your stomach, because you'll either have the urge to vomit, or need to hold in your omnipresent laughter.<p>2.  To show off contemporary versions (circa 1990) of Ray Harryhausen-esque stop-motion techniques:<p>The special effects, while dated in the face of CGI prodigiousness, are enormous and spectacular.  A vast skeletal army emerges from the darkness, each with his/her own unique personality and movement.  The battle they undertake is credible and real and awe-inspiring.  It is ridiculously hyper-kinetic, full of carnage and mayhem, more than any climactic fight scene I've ever seen.  Never put anything past Sam Raimi.  Even on a miniscule budget he can create something that'll knock your socks off, and tickle your feet.<p>3.  To give the glorious Bruce Campbell more moments to shine.<p>Above all else, this is the real reason why this movie exists (Raimi thinks so: by the opening credits alone you'd swear the movie was called "Bruce Campbell vs. Army of Darkness").  Campbell has the unique ability to play Ash, hero of the first two "Evil Dead" movies, as both intensely cool and dumb as a post.  It's a nice mix that allows him to display the pomposity of a superhero and the self-awareness of a post-modern ironist.  One scene in particular shows this off nicely.  It takes place in a graveyard, in front of an altar where the Necronomicon (Book of the Dead) is kept.  Only there are three books, a number Ash wasn't expecting.  Casually opening the first one, he reveals a powerful vacuum/vortex, sucking into its gaping maw all that come near.  Ash is one of the first casualties.  But he emerges heroically, unharmed except for a ridiculously elongated chin.  The joke is that Campbell's chin is his most notorious selling point (he called his autobiography "If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B-movie Actor").  Mocking himself so mercilessly, it becomes an even more delicious moment.<p>His other skill, besides his self-deprecating sense of humour, is his delivery.  Raimi and his brother Ivan deliver an almost purposefully banal script, knowing full well that the verve and intensity of Campbell's delivery will amplify its humour.  And they're right.  Ash's lines, so eminently quotable, appear rather dull when typed out ("Groovy", "Hold on Mr. Fancy Pants", "Baby you got ugly", and "Baby give me some sugar" being the most notorious examples).  The power comes from the way Campbell's reading is combined with the way Raimi sets up these lines perfectly: a dramatic pause, then a quick zoom in on Bruce's loopy mug, then the slick delivery of the line.  It's an addictive concoction that had me roaring in delight each time.  Furthermore, add the fact that all the actors around him play their scenes stone straight, and you find yourself wondering why Campbell isn't a bigger star.<p>"Army of Darkness" will not add up to much for those uninitiated with (or underwhelmed by) the "Evil Dead" series.  But for those that are, it's more of the good times promised by Raimi and Co.  Check your mind at the door, paste a goofy grin on your face (you'll need it later), and get set for 81 minutes of mirth and mayhem.</p></body></html>

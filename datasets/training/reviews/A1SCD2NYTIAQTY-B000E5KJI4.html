With Brad Pitt trying to pull off Achilles, and some pretty sickening, almost Australian accents in some of the actors, it was a fairly mediocre experience all round. This was not helped by my suspicions it would be complete crap with all the big names in it. However, after watching the movie for a second passing, it started to endear itself to me.<br /><br />Brad Pitt was still a bit of a miscast Achilles, and Peter O'Toole an odd choice for Priam, the King of Troy, but the bad guys were very well cast, I thought. Agamemnon and Menalaus were both brilliantly portrayed in all of their warlike savagery. Orlando Bloom seemed more plastic than normal as Paris, second prince of Troy, and the lover of Helen.<br /><br />On the plus side, the cinematography was simply superb, and when the CGI was used to assist, it was of very high quality. The overall visual effects were exception, from the sets used right through to the battle scenes.<br /><br />The special features in this edition are fairly good, and well worth the look themselves. I found them informative and interesting, though unless you are a "The Making of..." geek like me, you might want to pass on them.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is not the best I have seen, of course, but for a big budget, Hollywood production with the big name stars, it is not too bad at all. I could easily sit through an additional viewing or two and not be spending too much time eating.</p></body></html>

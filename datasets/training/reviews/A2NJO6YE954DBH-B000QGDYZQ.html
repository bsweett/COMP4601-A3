<meta name="summary" content="An interesting premise and Bullock's performance cannot save this film"></head><body><p>Linda Hanson (Sandra Bullock) has become unstuck in time.  Actually the time frame is one week in which the days have been shuffled.  She wakes up and it is Thursday, but the next day it is the previous Monday, and the day after that it is the following Saturday.  This is all confusing and quite maddening to Linda, especially since Thursday is the day the sheriff rings the doorbell and tells her that her husband had been killed in a car accident the day before.  That means when she wakes up on Monday Jim (Julian McMahon) is still alive, but on Saturday they are burying him.  Family and friends are starting to think that Linda is having mental problems, and she is having problems wrapping her mind around what is going on herself.  But if she knows what is going to happen, then she can do something about it, right?<br /><br />This is one of Bullock's better performances as she takes advantage of the opportunity to do something different, but despite her best efforts this film lives and dies by the script by Bill Kelly ("Blast from the Past").  The basic idea is pretty intriguing: Linda is living the days of this week out of sequence, which gives her the opportunity to do something about Jim's death.  The script even takes a nice twist when Linda starts thinking that maybe she should not do anything and just let it happen.  However, Kelly's script suffers from two fatal flaws, the first having to deal with Linda's ability to change things and the second with the way this twisted time travel tale plays out.<br /><br />If you have not seen "Premonition" then you should look away at this point because THERE BE SPOILERS HERE and I am going to rant and rave about these reasons why I deducted two stars off of this 2007 film's rating.  If you have not seen the film and are interested in the premise and/or actress, then check it out sometime and then come back and read the rest of this review:<br /><br />My rant is because Linda does not stop Bridgette from going through the plate glass door.  That happens on Tuesday and on Sunday Linda could put the damn flower stickers and save the door.  Bridgette did not have scars on Thursday, which was "before" Tuesday, but then she did not have them on Wednesday, which was "after" Tuesday.  Clearly Linda can do something about the past (which is where the future is usually found in this movie), and even if she does not want to do anything about Jim, she should want to spare Bridgette from getting her face all cut up.  I go back to the original "Nightmare on Elm Street" when Nancy wakes up and has yanked Freddy's hat back with her from her nightmare.  Nancy knows that this is important and figures out how she can make it work for her.  Linda is given a similar cosmic clue and she does absolutely nothing with it.  I thought preventing her daughter's accident would be the catalyst on Wednesday for Linda deciding to prevent the accident, but<br /><br />My rave is that we get to the end of this film and it turns out that for all its complexity what with shuffling the days of the week and having Linda wrestle with whether or not she should prevent the accident, "Premonition" turns out to be such a variation on the old time traveling story that I have always related with the "Titanic."  You go back in time to stop the "Titanic" from hitting an iceberg, and while you are yelling, "Look out for the iceberg!" you distract the crew so they do not see the iceberg.  So Linda becomes the cause of Jim's death by trying to stop it.  Dramatic irony aside, the theoretical position here is that you cannot change the past because your attempt to change the past is already part of the past, so there.  The theological posturing at the end is too little too late, because I find it hard to believe that Linda would be able to live with what she has done.  Adding insult to injury is the alternate ending, which to me says they did not even have the courage of their conviction with the inadequate resolution of their intriguing premise.  At least the gag reel is about actually gags played on the set and not just flubbed lines, which was a nice touch, but not enough to redeem the flaws in this film.</p></body></html>

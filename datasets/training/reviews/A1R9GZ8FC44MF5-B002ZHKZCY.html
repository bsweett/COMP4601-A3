<meta name="summary" content="Better then the first... by about 2 crashes."></head><body><p>Thats all, the car chase is barely better, and there is no other action sequence in the whole damn movie, acid trippin camera movements DONT COUNT AS ACTION SCENES, in fact they can ruin the only fight and car cahse you have (which they did), i guess they spent all their budget on all the cocaine they gave the camera guy instead of buying him a stand.  The performances are average at best, the story is predictable and routine (the framing someon for a murder as been done, to death), there is humor, drama, suspense, nothing.  1 out of a 10 for the improved car chase, but it still isnt even remotly comparible to the one in Matrix Reloaded (the best car chase ever), no visual effects isnt really something to be proud of, dont make a third there cant possibly be a market left for this, but i guess since they are still making damn chucky movies, anything is possible.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Exciting & jaw-dropping special effects + Gripping robot fighting scenes + Colorful  picture + Not funny as the first film"></head><body><p>- The special effects are exciting and jaw-dropping.<br /><br />- The robot fighting scenes are much easier to see than those of the previous movie. Here, I can clearly see who is fighting against whom. Or who is being beaten up.<br /><br />- The action is non-stop.<br /><br />- The picture is colorful.<br /><br />- Meegan Fox is irresistibly sexy.<br /><br />- It has less funny scenes than the first movie.<br /><br />I believe it's one of the best action movies of 2009. I own it.</p></body></html>

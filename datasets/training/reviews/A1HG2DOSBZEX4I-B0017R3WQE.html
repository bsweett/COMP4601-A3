The story is familiar to just about everyone. Tony Montana (Al Pacino) comes to America as part of the Cuban boat lift with literally nothing. He kills a Communist in Feedom City and becomes friends with Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) Miami's leading cocaine dealer. The film arc at this point follows the story line of the 1932 Howard Hawks film of the same title and Montana rises to be a powerful drug lord. Eventually getting in trouble because of his own need to achieve he is then brutally murdered by the Columbian cartel. Limited support for Pacino's over the top portrayal comes from best fiend Manny (Stephen Bauer) and a very young Michelle Pieffer who plays love interest Elvira.<p>The 20th Anniversary Edition presents the film in widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. The picture looks great thanks to the late John A. Alonzo's cinematography but I felt that the sound left a little to be desired.<p>The performances have become legendary and Pacino carries the film with his completely over the top portrayal. Supporting players do little more than allow him to show off his acting ability.<p>Is this grat cinema? After 20 years reflection, my answer would be no but it is a good genre film. The problem is that when this movie came out it was completely innovative in terms of violence and language. Today, we have simply seen this before. The 2:50 length also detracts. There are places in the film where it seems to crawl. Overall, the film is good but it simply is not what I remembered from twenty years ago. Perhaps I'm just getting old.<p>The special features comprise an entire disc but offer nothing spectacular. The best  feature is a series of making of type documentaries hosted by producer Martin Bregman with interviews with Oliver Stone, Pacino, Bauer, and film composer Georgio Morodor. This feature discusses the film from its origins to actual filming and ratiting difficulties. There is also  a television edits reel that is more funny than enlightening. A twenty minute deleted scenes feature offers little since there is no context in which to view these scenes and no director commentary.<p>Def Jam has added a feature explaining why the film has become a Hip Hop classic and features many performer interviews. This feature is interesting and offers a look inside the rap industry.<p>Overall this would be a good rental if you're not an absolute fan. A piece of cultural history maybe but not what I remembered.</p></body></html>

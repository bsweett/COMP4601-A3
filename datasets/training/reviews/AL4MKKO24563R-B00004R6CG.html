It was dismissed by critics, ignored by audiences and, to my knowledge, didn't win a single Academy Award (this  last part isn't shocking -- Citizen Kane didn't win Best Picture). It's  interesting that the reputation of this film seems to have grown  substantially since the public found out more about Alfred Hitchcock's  private life. For example, Scottie Ferguson's obsession with Kim Novak  mirrors Hitch's own obsession with beautiful blondes, most notably Grace  Kelly. Actors often bare their souls to the world, but very rarely are we  aware when a director bares his/her soul. Those who dismiss Hitchcock as  just a taskmaster director of suspense films should study Vertigo. He is  essentially dealing with his own weaknesses and inner demons on  film.<p>Vertigo also contains two great performances -- those of James  Stewart and Kim Novak. Stewart reveals a dark side that might shock those  who just know him from Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and It's a Wonderful  Life. He is completely believeable as a man (Hitchcock's alter ego) who is  consumed by obsession. Likewise Kim Novak is wonderful and totally  convincing as Madeline/Judy. Vera Miles (Lila Crane in Psycho) was  originally cast, but it's hard to see anyone else but Kim Novak in the  role. She is utterly convincing as the distant, aristocratic Madeline AND  as the earthy working class girl Judy. I can't think of many actresses who  could be so effective in both roles. Grace Kelly, for example, might have  been able to pull off Madeline, but probably would have been laughable as  Judy. It's too bad more directors couldn't see past Novak's sex kitten  image and cast her in more substantial roles.<p>In case you couldn't guess,  I highly recommend this DVD. The documentary about the restoration of the  film is very interesting and makes you realize what a job it is to restore  a film. The DVD edition also includes an ending that was only on the  foreign release prints. This edition does Hitchcock's masterpiece all the  justice it deserves and then some.<p>(An additional note: I live in the San  Francisco Area and have visited many of the locations featured in the film,  including Madeline's apartment, Muir Woods, Mission Delores, The Palace of  the Legion of Honor and Fort Point. Just to clarify for those of you who  might be wondering: (1) there is no portrait of Carlotta at the Palace of  the Legion of Honor and (2) there are no stairs leading down to the water  at Fort Point -- the stairs were an in-studio shot that enabled James  Stewart to more easily fish Kim Novak out of San Francisco Bay.)</p></body></html>

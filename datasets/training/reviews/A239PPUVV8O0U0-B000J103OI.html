<meta name="summary" content="Streep Steals The Show"></head><body><p>Like my review for To Wong Foo, I'm at a loss for words with this one. Its not a genre I regularly review but I'm gonna try my best. Meryl Streep is just a great actress, she can do anything. Period. She plays the boss from hell so perfectly that there is sympathy for Miranda when she has her little "heart to heart" near the end. Anne Hathaway proves she can do more than Disney films, convincingly leaving that part of her behind and stepping into a more mature role. She plays Andrea very well and she doesn't seem intimidated by Streep at all. Her portrayal as a girl who is naive about the world of fashion but gets sucked into the world of success and begins to lose everything around her is very well done. Stanley Tucci and Emily Blunt are also excellent supporting players in this, Blunt very handily playing the snob and Tucci as the helpful yet sarcastic fashion designer/consultant, whatever. The songs used in the film are superfluous and I wish they didn't have them. They're just really annoying. Well that's all I got on this one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="To me not the greatest ever but is a milestone"></head><body><p>This was the film that almost never was. Orson Welles, an accomplished radio personality was given a really extraordinary deal by RKO Studios. Basically he had complete control over his projects, final say on the final cut, whatever actors he wanted and could write, star and direct this film. However, it was too closely related to the life of a newspaper tycoon that he wanted it destroyed. And how's this for irony: the "greatest film ever made" was actually booed whenever one of it's 9 Oscar nominations were announced on stage.<br /><br />The movie starts out famously with Charles Foster Kane, an old man clutching a snow globe and muttering "Rosebud" before dying. A news reporter wants to find out what was so special about this word, could mean anything, could mean nothing. So we find a man named Thompson visiting people who knew Kane and see if he can unravel the mystery.<br /><br />While it may not look like since it's been near 60 years since the film came out, there was a lot of new camera techniques and lighting on the film. One it introduced was deep focus photography, where everything in front of the camera and everything way in the background were in focus, which was new since it was usually one's clear, one isn't.<br /><br />Also with the help of deep focus, certain scenes suggest something without saying it. There's a shot where Kane is signing away control to his fortune so he doesn't by everything in sight and in the room behind is what looks like a standard sized room with a standard sized mirror. However he walks closer to the mirror and you find out it's a big damn mirror with the top of it being close to 20 feet above his head. Another scene is in regards to a massive fireplace same concept.<br /><br />There's the infamous political rally where he just basically had a painting, punched some holes and moved lights around to simulate movement. When Kane meets his 2nd wife his face is fully lit, but when things start to go little sour, he's backlit(meaning his face is in shadow). There's many more of these(for example in the opening scene there's one window that is always in the same place every single frame despite we're getting closer to the mansion.<br /><br />All this talk of the technological feats and not a word about the film itself. To be honest, it's a good film. It's not "holy $%#@ that's the best film eva!" but it's not horrible. You watch it and it's not a moving film, it's just really well done.<br /><br />Also, check out the Ebert commentary. Say what you want about his tastes but he does know film. He's like an encyclopedia almost bringing details that you'd think "why would he know that? and how?" He also gets into the technical shots and how they were done which is quite different for a critic.<br /><br />Anyway you look at it, it is a quite well-made film, it's just it may not be everyone's cup of tea but there's a lot of people who seem to like this cup.<br /><br />P.S: The tycoon is William Randolph Hearst and for proof that this may be based on his life: Hearst's mistress, actress Marion Davies, had a nickname for her umm, sexual body part between her legs...."rosebud".</p></body></html>

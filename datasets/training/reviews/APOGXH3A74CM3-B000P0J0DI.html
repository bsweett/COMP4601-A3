<meta name="summary" content="As we forgive those"></head><body><p>If there's redemption in this movie, it is for the viewer!<p>Each and every character in this film has his or her motive for doing the things that lead up to the brilliant finale.  And those motives aren't forgiveness or redemption.  They're self-indulgent.<p>These motives are often explored simultaneously and work in conduction with one another.  <p>There's no virtue. Neither behind the badge nor the gun!  The chain of events in this film lead to small revelations for the characters, but each of them knows that it's too late to act on them.  <p>Life and circumstance have tainted them and they can't forgive nor be forgiven!<p>This is the straw extended to the viewer - forgiveness depends on how you forgive those...<p>This is what makes this a great film!</p></body></html>

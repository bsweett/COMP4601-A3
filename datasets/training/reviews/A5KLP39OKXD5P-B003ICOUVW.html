<meta name="summary" content="A classic werewolf experience!"></head><body><p>A genuinely horrifying film concentrating neatly on werewolves in the most simplified manner possible, the best part of the film is, that during the whole film we witness an atmosphere that keeps whispering to us that 'something is going to happen!'.<br />A fabulous performance from Benecio Del Toro, makes the film much attractive and exceeds one's expectations easily. Benecio's performance is enough to get hold of your eyes and glue them to the screen quite easily. The rest of the cast deliver a decent performance. Overall, the film is very well made and if you liked 'Ginger snaps', give this a try, you won't be disappointed.</p></body></html>

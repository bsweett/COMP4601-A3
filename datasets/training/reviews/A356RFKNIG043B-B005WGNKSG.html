<meta name="summary" content="Endless, occasionally sadistic, implausible and rather boring rape/revenge "thriller""></head><body><p>2.5 stars<br /><br />The book may be great; never read it. But the movie of it is over 2.5 hours, too long by at least 40 minutes, and features way too many lingering shots of everything while creating easy villains to justify manipulative filmmaking. I guess most reviewers here have read the book and would love the movie no matter what, but as one new to the story, I found it laughably implausible and silly: does every family have a Nazi sadist hidden in the attic? It would seem so, along with the ubiquitous corporate villainy and working class hero(es) to thwart them all and save the day.<br /><br />The two leads are good, but the early very sadistic rape scenes were to my mind unnecessary, just another cheesy rape/revenge set-up that so many lazy writers use to create "suspense" and "resolution" and "redemption". We've seen this all before, and in 90 minutes. This girl can just hack into anything? Frankly, the whole thing feels like it was tailor-made to exploit the market of women who've been molested and want vicarious revenge. I can think of no other reason this movie would be rated so highly.<br /><br />I liked the Swedish scenery, and there are some fine shots and ideas here, but all in all I was bored by about 70 minutes in and the next 80 were just flat out predictable and unexciting, with so many plot holes and faux Agatha Christie nods that it became almost a joke.<br /><br />I wouldn't watch this again for all the kroner in Sweden.</p></body></html>

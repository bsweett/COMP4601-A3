<meta name="summary" content=""There are no bad houses - only bad people""></head><body><p>The Amityville Horror seems like a strange choice for a remake. The original movie was never really that great anyway, which begs the question of why this version needed to be made in the first place. The good news, however, is that it sticks very closely to the characters and story of the popular 1979 horror film, even recreating, with varying degrees of success, the 70's period look.<br /><br />The only major difference is that it's a half-hour shorter, which means the movie packs a punch much more quickly and is much more deftly paced. The movie also has a bearded Ryan Reynolds, who bares his spectacularly chiseled body at every chance he can get. And his body is indeed spectacular even though his chest is a bit too fussily buff at least for 1975 when the movie is set.<br /><br />George Lutz (Reynolds) is newly married to Kathy (Melissa George), who has three youngsters by her late first husband. That Kathy would have a 12-year-old son is a bit of a stretch, but this does create a new source of tension as the young and slightly overweight Billy (Jesse James) bitterly resents the new man in his mom's life.<br /><br />Everyone in the family is still getting to know one another as they move into the haunted house. Only the adults are aware of the house's grotesque legacy, with their fussy real estate agent, blithely sanguine about the strange goings on.  The Lutz's anxiety to escape the confines of a crowded apartment causes George to shrug that "there are no bad houses -- only bad people," even as the estate agent tells them that a mass murder occurred in the house a year ago.<br /><br />To the movie's credit, absolutely no time is wasted on the set-up with the spooky goings on rolling out almost immediately.  Blood pours out of the light fixtures, arms come out of walls, the kids having ghostly visitations, and George turns into a red-eyed madman chasing the rest of the family around with a maniacal grin and an ax.<br /><br />The bloodied ghosts of dead people turn up frequently, and are glimpsed in mirrors, empty rooms, and in nightmares, especially by George, who seems to become more and more besotted with the house. And the youngest child, Chelsea (Chloe Grace Moretz), claims to see the youngest murder victim, Jodie (Isabel Conner), though no one realizes that Jodie is trying to lure Chelsea to her death.<br /><br />The priest (Philip Baker Hall), who is unable or unwilling to exorcise the house's demons - he admits that the house frightens him - is thankfully marginalized here, he's replaced by a baby-sitter (Rachel Nichols); she's a sex kitten, who teases Billy and taunts the ghost of Chelsea. Locked in a clothes cupboard, she ends up freaked out and carted off in an ambulance.<br /><br />George's mental and physical deterioration remains the same: He gets sick, is constantly cold and obsessively chops wood to feed the wood-burning furnace. This film is willing to make the husband a much more unsympathetic character, and Reynolds does what he can with the rather pedestrian material, even sporting the beard that is obviously trying to make him look older than he really is.<br /><br />Fortunately, Australian actress George, as beautiful as she is talented, steps into the breach as family protector and turns the wife into the film's real protagonist. But the main problem with the Amityville Horror is that it's just not that scary - most of the creepiness comes across as rather silly and absurd, and there's a real sense that we've seen it all before. Nothing gets in the way of the rote staging, the ham-handed obviousness, and the feeling that you've been to this house, and yawned at these ghosts, once too often.

With the inclusion of Alice in Wonderland, I have seen, reviewed, and rated ten Tim Burton-directed films. (Two others, Batman Returns and Mars Attacks!, I've seen, but don't remember enough about to rate. I plan to go back and rewatch them eventually.) I was initially kind of surprised at the average rating, which is pretty low, but when it comes right down to it, the best "Tim Burton" movie ever made was not actually directed by Burton (Henry Selick's The Nightmare Before Christmas, on which Burton served as a producer). And his recent outings have fared pretty miserably with me, with the exception of The Corpse Bride. I don't think it's a case, as was hypothesized on The Rotten Tomatoes Show, of the public (in this case, me) getting tired of Burton's same old visual tricks. No, when I look a little further into this, I see a pattern, and the Corpse Bride exception noted above may have already tipped you off to it: in every case but one on my spreadsheet, the higher-rated movies are Burton originals, and the lower-rated movies are adaptations. (The sole exception is Burton's first Batman film.) And in that regard, Alice in Wonderland is my favorite Burton adaptation since that first Batman movie over twenty years ago, but I still don't think it measures up to Burton classics like Beetlejuice and Ed Wood.<br /><br />Alice in Wonderland gives us, in essence, a sequel to the story we're all used to from countless other films based on Carroll; in this one, Alice (Skin's Mia Wasikowska) is nineteen and believes her childhood trip to Wonderland was a dream. On the verge of becoming engaged to Hamish (Kinky Boots' Leo Bill), Alice, who has ever strained against Victorian conformity, runs off following a hare in a waistcoat. Then down the rabbit hole, &c., &c., and back to the world that she believes to be in her dreams. She hooks up with the usual suspects, including the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp), and is told of her true destiny: the kingdom is dying under the reign of the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and her pet enforcer, the Jabberwocky (voice of Christopher Lee). The Hatter and his rebel pals want to see the White Queen (Brokeback Mountain's Anne Hathaway) reinstalled on the throne, and it has been foretold that only Alice can defeat the jabberwocky in battle. But first, she has to get the Vorpal Sword, which is in the possession of the Red Queen...<br /><br />what a cast Burton assembled for this spectacle. Aside form the abovementioned, Marton Csokas, Timothy Spall, Crispin Glover, Alan Rickman, Stephen Fry, and Imelda Staunton, among many others. And the casting is right in line with Burton's oft-mentioned, sometimes-criticized method of filmmaking, which is "throw as much spectacle at the screen as possible and have the audience hang on for the ride." Too often, the spectacle is used as a cover for the boringness of the plot, the entire lack of plot, or Burton's odd inability to actually present a compelling case for the adaptation/remake/what-have-you in question. After seeing early reviews for Alice in Wonderland, I expected the same sort of thing here, but I didn't get it; there's actually more of a plot to this than there was to Burton's pale, boring Sweeney Todd, and that plot is more coherent than it was in his confusing, silly Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Which pretty much by default makes it his best adaptation in the past decade. (I refuse to watch Big Fish; every bad actor gets one good film, and Ewan MacGregor, who is a terrible actor, got his with Little Voice.) Still, many of the criticisms levelled at the movie are well warranted. Wasikowska is a stunning lass, to be sure, but her portrayal of Alice is rather wooden. (And, much to the disappointment of quite a few people in my party, she spends a great deal of time falling out of her clothing, but never gets naked.) In reflection, though, it should be no surprise that Depp and Carter steal the show; the two of them have been thick as thieves with Burton for years now. Who's going to be allowed to yank the spotlight away? Which makes the wooden-ness of Wasikowska's portrayal a minor thing, really; think of this as an ensemble piece and it will be less noticeable. The spectacle is in place, Depp and Carter are in fine form, and there are many, many worse ways to spend a couple of hours in a darkened theater.<br /><br />Which would be a perfect place to end this review, but I feel compelled to mention that if you're looking for a visual-spectacle version of Alice where acting is less important than visuals, it's been done before, and better, and is available through your DVD-by-mail rental subscription, whichever one you may have (I know Netflix, BBO, and GreenCine all have copies)--Alice, Jan Svankmajer's superlative 1988 film. I haven't seen it recently enough to be able to point out specific places where Burton's film parallels it, but I remember enough of it, in that vague sort of way, to see how Burton is at least aware of Svankmajer's film and is paying homage to it with some of his choices here. If you saw Burton's film and were less than impressed, see Svankmajer's. Or even if you loved Burton's film, see Svankmajer's. ***</p></body></html>

Directed by Apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind helmer Ron Howard, The Da Vinci Code is a fascinating, complex tale that begins with the murder of Jacques Sauniere, a curator at the Musee du Louvre in Paris, while Professor Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is speaking at a conference on symbology.  When Langdon is contacted by French police and taken to the Louvre, ostensibly to help the police with the case, that's where the fun begins!<br /><br />The story in The Da Vinci Code is a fast-paced one, but not so much so that the average viewer is left completely confused.  Written by A Beautiful Mind scribe Akiva Goldsman, the script tightens up the plot enough that it can be fitted into a 2 1/2 hour movie without leaving a person wondering if he's missed something.  I must admit, Mr. Goldsman has come a long way from Batman Forever!<br /><br />The choices in casting for this movie were very good as well.  Tom Hanks plays Langdon with a laconic, dry wit that reminds me somewhat of British historian Simon Schama, and Audrey Tautou is exquisite as Sophie Neveu, the granddaughter of Sauniere who harbors a very special secret, one unknown even to her.  Paul Bettany is engaging, yet frightening as the albino monk Silas, and Jean Reno excels in his role as Bezu Fache, the French cop who thinks that Langdon is the killer.  Lastly, there's the wonderfully diabolical Alfred Molina as Bishop Aringarosa, the Opus Dei priest who appears to be controlling the puppet strings at first, but who is being manipulated by a mysterious voice over the phone called the Teacher.<br /><br />Most of the arguments I've seen against The Da Vinci Code center around its presentation of historical myths such as the Priory of Sion and Mary Magdalene as the wife of Jesus as "fact".  With all respect to those who might use this as an excuse to trash The Da Vinci Code, let me say again what has already been repeated on here more than a dozen times: IT'S JUST A MOVIE.  I myself have seen several documentaries and read a not inconsiderable amount of literature that completely debunks the Priory of Sion and the presentation of Mary Magdalene as Jesus' wife and mother of the Merovingian line, yet I enjoy The Da Vinci Code because IT'S JUST A MOVIE.  No mystery there.<br /><br />When all is said and done, I heartily recommend The Da Vinci Code.  It's a film with enough twists and plots to keep you guessing until the end.</p></body></html>

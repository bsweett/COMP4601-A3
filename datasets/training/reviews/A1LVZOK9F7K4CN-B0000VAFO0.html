<meta name="summary" content="Should have been better..."></head><body><p>In the hands of truly imaginative people, this concept could've been a lot more fun.  Think of it Vampires versus Werewolves.  However, the biggest problem is that the filmmakers cared more about the look of the film than the story.  Specifically, the only thing this film seems to want to do is imitate The Matrix: they copy the art direction, the wardrobe, the cinematography - there are some shots that are exact duplicates.  Of all the Famous Monsters of Filmland, the werewolf is perhaps the most terrifying, but they keep getting ruined on film.  These wolves are too CGI to be really scary - and why to they need to walk on walls?<br /><br />However, the movie is not a total train wreck.  There is enough non-stop action to pass a rainy afternoon in front of the TV.  It just could've been better.</p></body></html>

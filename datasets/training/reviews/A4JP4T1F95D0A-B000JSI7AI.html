So anyone who might be turned off by reports of this being all about 2 men making out can give this movie a try.  The story, set in 1963 Wyoming is more a character study about 2 men who fall in love with each other.  Ennis and Jack share something special, but they can never reveal it to the world or even let on.  This is 1963 and the heart of middle America, and you don't dare come out of the closet.  The two men spend the next 20 years trying to spend some time together out in the seclusion of the mountains, while trying to maintain the appearance of normal heterosexual lives with wives and children.  It is a very good look at forbidden love.  Well acted all the way around, with an interesting story.  2 parts kept this from being 5 stars from me.  The first is the sexual encounter between the men.  To me it just happened all of a sudden.  I would have enjoyed more of a buildup.  The second is Jack's parents, who hinted at knowing that he was gay.  I would have liked to seen more of his relationship with them, or given a more clear understanding of what they knew.  Other than that, this was well crafted and worth a watch.</p></body></html>

Even though this doesn't even come close to the original, it's not a total loss. The special effects and even some of the CG are impressive. And just the look of the massive ship both before and after the tragedy are awesome to watch. But the acting is rather bland, and that totally surprised me considering the cast. Also, Wolfgang Petersen made The Perfect Storm, which was a great movie, so I know he knows how to do wave effects, but the 'Rogue Wave' that turns the Poseidon looks lame and cheap, not very exciting at all. Not too mislead anyone, since I graded this a C, it actually deserves 2.5 stars, mmmkay?</p></body></html>

I say A+"></head><body><p>"I'm ready to be a real husband and father, just wake up. Please Liz, just wake up." Mike King (Clooney) is having a rough time. He is the trustee for his families land in Hawaii and is about to finalize the sale of it. He has two daughters he is trying to raise with thier mother and his wife in a coma. At the time he gets the news that his wife is for all accounts dead he finds out that she was also cheating on him. There are some movies that are so good that after you watch there really are no words to describe it. This is one of those movies. Anything I say may cheapen the way this movie makes you feel. I can say that Clooney did an amazing job in this movie. He plays a guy that is down on his luck and a type of "everyman"...and he makes it believable. For someone like Clooney to pull that off is amazing. Also the girl that plays his older daughter is absolutly wonderful and almost steals the movie. This is again a movie that needs to be watched but there are not enough words to describe why. Overall, one of the best movies of the year and I have to say "The Artist" must be amazing in order to beat this for best picture. I give it an A+</p></body></html>

As the denizens of Antonio Bay gather and celebrate, a dense, spooky, meteorologically perverse fog rolls inland, against the wind, and begins to exert a malignant influence. And, within the fog lurks... something - something that craves a reckoning. Sure 'nuff, several Antonio Bay-ans begin to die off, all in gruesome CGI fashion. Elizabeth Williams, a wayward daughter of Antonio Bay recently come home, has been having disturbing dreams; she begins to delve into the mysterious goings-on. She and boyfriend Nick Castle uncover a dark, long-hidden secret that originates back to 1871, a secret which implicates the founding fathers in an act of atrocity. Can she, Nick, sultry radio deejay Stevie Wayne, and crazed Father Malone (who you just know is keeping something to himself) make a successful last stand against the relentless fog and its murderous phantom passengers? Anyways, Happy Founding Fathers' Day.<br /><br />This remake attempts to take advantage of the heat factor brought in by current television "hot" stars: Tom Welling (Smallville) and Maggie Grace (Lost). Unfortunately, Tom Welling's opening scene, where the film is suppose to strongly establish his leading character, charter boat owner Nick Castle, by having him deliver a bracing speech to his crew and clientele, flops ignominiously. Instead of sounding self-assured, he comes off as someone trying to sound grown up. I guess, in my mind, he's still young, high-schooler Clark Kent, even with that stubble. From there on, it's downhill for Welling, as he fails to make an impact and, in fact, sets new standards of cardboard cutout acting. Lovely Maggie Grace fares better than Welling, as she comes out the more developed protagonist. As the disaffected Elizabeth saddled with wanderlust, she settles down nicely in her plot-propelling, co-leading lady role. And, compared to Welling, who seems to be forcing it, she seems more comfortable and more natural in her emoting. The movie's saving grace is Selma Blair and her vigorous turn as Stevie Wayne. As I recall, the original Stevie Wayne (as sexily portrayed by Adrienne Barbeau) was also the high point of the original Fog. Adrian Hough as Father Malone, a priest burdened with a disturbing secret, is unsettlingly weird and tortured.<br /><br />What makes one movie palatable and another unsavory? This version retains the same key characters and apes most of the original premise (with some details altered in a fruitless bid for creativity), and yet doesn't come near in entertainment value. I'm not sure. The original Fog, while inherently cheesy, had several endearing moments, which gave it a nice flavor and favored cult film status. Maybe Adrienne Barbeau and Jamie Lee Curtis just had that singular "it" quality? Maybe Maggie Grace is too generic? Or is it Welling's insipid acting? Or maybe the oh-so-crappy, "huh?"-inducing ending here? One of the best parts about the original was Stevie Wayne's disembodied, night-owl radio voice stealing away from her lonely lighthouse, lending a sensation of dread isolation to the film. I relished the impending sense of doom and high-tension drama that washed over me as Stevie steadfastly remained in her lighthouse and tried her level best to direct her listeners to safety thru the radio, all the while frantic for her son's safety and knowing she herself might soon fall under attack. Those wondrous chills are missing in this remake, because this version's Stevie deserted her station pretty quickly. I also didn't like the fact that Nick and Stevie have a past relationship here, or that Nick and Elizabeth have a current relationship predating the movie. Part of the allure of the original to me was the concept of strangers initially going about it their separate ways and then finally, desperately banding together in a last stand against the ghosts.<br /><br />In the last generation, there's been such an influx of derivative horror flicks with the same crude shock effects that the audience's level of tolerance has considerably dropped. Nowadays, a film of this genre has to be truly innovative or truly shocking to make an impact. There's a reason this movie wasn't first screened for the critics before it was released. This version of the Fog mind-numbingly plays itself out by the numbers. The changes the writers install doesn't improve a whit on the original. Given, there are some cool special effects (the death of one Antonio Bay citizen involving shards of glass is nifty) and, I guess, some decent "boo" sequences, even though you see them coming a fog bank away. But the trite plot and cliched scriptwork take away from what atmospheric ambiance is retained from the original.<br /><br />So, two stars for this one: I originally had it as a one star stinkarama, but reluctantly threw in an extra star for Maggie Grace and Selma Blair's earnest, if ultimately futile, efforts. In terms of quality, this is on the same par as the incompetent, predictable, and unscary Darkness, The Boogeyman, and Cursed. Trust me and most of the reviewers here, go check out the original instead.</p></body></html>

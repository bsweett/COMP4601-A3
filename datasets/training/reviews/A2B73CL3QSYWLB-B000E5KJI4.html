I attribute it to some degree with the liberties I am told were taken by the filmmakers with Homer's "The Iliad".  I wouldn't know since I slept through this portion of world cultures class when I was in school.  My teachers just couldn't make it as engaging as Wolfgang Petersen has here.  Alot of the invective was also directed at Brad Pitt's performance as Achilles.  This role is a no-win situation for Pitt.  How do you portray the greatest warrior the world has known without appearing to be a bit preening and narcissistic?  Director Petersen has staged here an impressive spectacle indeed.  The sprawl of this film takes your breath away.  The battle scenes are as impressive as anything this side of "Braveheart".  The spectacle would be nothing, however, if the characters were overwhelmed by the proceedings.  Fortunately, this film contains a number of wonderful performances.  Special citation has to go to Eric Bana who gives a star-making performance as Hector.  Bana more than holds his own, sometimes dominating, the more seasoned pros he is working with.  Peter O'Toole as Priam can still command the screen forty years after "Lawrence of Arabia" with that unmistakable voice and those intense eyes.  Newcomer Rose Byrne as Briseis, niece of Priam, is an engaging actress.  I found myself more attracted to her character than I was to Diane Kruger as Helen, the beauty that launched a thousand ships.  If you're looking for entertainment that will also offer food-for-thought then "Troy" is the film for you.</p></body></html>

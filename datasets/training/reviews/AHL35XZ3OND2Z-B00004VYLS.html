Michael Keaton may be wearing black Nikes and Jack Nicholson may be done up in white makeup and green hair, but this one is for real.  Nicholson is particularly masterful as the signature caper opposite the immortal caped crusader - "This town needs an enema!"  Batman is a classic and despite its age, a solid and memorable piece of filmmaking.  Where the Christopher Nolan envisioned Batman Begins and The Dark Knight feel as if it does occur in a real world, Tim Burton's Batman feels as if it takes place in its own universe.  That in itself is a compliment.  There is some real imagination at work here and this is probably the best movie Tim Burton will ever make.  Batman Returns definitely outdid Batman in some areas, notably in editing and production design.  But, Batman has a balanced script where our lead superhero doesn't have a cameo appearance in the villain shod sequel.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray<br /><br />This one holds water.  The transfer is vibrant and despite the occasional graininess, pretty sharp too.  Clean and simple cinematography drag the Dark Knight out of the gutter and into a bright High-Def presentation.  Color is vivid without being over-saturated.  Overall the film looks and feels natural.  Heck, even the pre-digital optical effects hold up for the most part.  The main casualty here is on the audio end of things.  Sound is clear but on the flat side, with surround mixing on the Tru-HD is a bit half-assed.  This is a mono track movie they dropped an occasional decibel to the rear speakers, but there's no real surround sound.  It is almost completely shot on sound stages and wasn't shot on IMAX, but Batman looks much better than its humble roots and age would imply.  Go buy it.<br /><br />The Movie  5/5<br />The Blu-Ray  4/5</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Tim Burton Love Story...'nuff said"></head><body><p>A friend loaned this to me. I avoided seeing it, though I was curious because of it's Oscar nomination. This is one of the sweetest love stories I've seen in years. The dead people are fun and energetic; the "live" people are as boring as mud (as depicted). There are totally believable (voiced) performances from good guys Depp, Bonham Carter & Watson, and the great Michael Gough. What made this different, and special from Burton's other animated films, is Danny Elfman's wonderful score, and especially the tribute to Gilbert & Sullivan. So clever, so intelligent. So unusual...it was the dead singing of their happiness. Let's just hope that little kids don't think it's "cool" to be dead. It's really a wonderful and sweet story, and, if kids listen, it's better to be alive. Making fun of the English, it's a tough call to say if "Curse of the Were-Rabbit" deserved that award. I loved both films. I'm sorry I put this one on the back-burner. I'd hate to think I'm a snob...</p></body></html>

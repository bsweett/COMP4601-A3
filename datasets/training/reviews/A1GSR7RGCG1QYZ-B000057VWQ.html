<meta name="summary" content="The Big-Box Swindle of Bedford Falls"></head><body><p>For many, "It's A Wonderful Life" is a staple to their holiday traditions.  With all major networks vying to get their hands on this mediocre blockbuster, this little film transforms from ordinary to cult status every holiday.  As a viewer, outside of the final act, this Jimmy Stewart classic is more than just a Christmas movie, but instead a powerful Capra film that demonstrates an America from long ago.  It shows a small-town America, without the plowed Wal-Mart roads or big-box makeovers.  For this critic, it demonstrates the power of independent business, and why we may never find this type of service ever again.  As an independent, downtown shop owner of about a year and a half myself; "It's A Wonderful Life" transformed this viewing from holiday pastime to dedicated film exposing the corruptive nature of capitalism as well as the realism of independent business.  With this change in tact, Jimmy Stewart's words become more emotional, Donna Reed's actions become more honest, and our little Christmas film transforms into a man's journey to search for himself.  I cannot denounce that this is a holiday film, Stewart screams "Merry Christmas" throughout the entire ending, but before that final conclusion there are about two hours of small town America and one man's struggle to escape.  "It's A Wonderful Life" is a powerful blend of realism and fantasy, individualism and community, dreams and truth, as well as frustration and joy.  The cast is superbly placed in their respective roles and Capra's action behind the camera stands boldly in place.  This is not just a movie, but an experience coupled with foreshadowing - giving George not just a glimpse of a world without him - but also a glimpse of a world without small business<br /><br />"It's A Wonderful Life", the film itself, is beautifully crafted.  With new editions being released each season, one can easily see the crisp beauty of Capra's image.  Its characters; George Bailey, Mary, Sam Wainright, Potter, Bert and Ernie, and even Clarence seem to jump from the screen, giving us imaginative citizens to this quaint town of Bedford Falls.  Capra not only gives these characters spirits and souls, but also the town.  Capra built three blocks of Bedford Falls so that he could capture the honesty of the town that Stewart so adamantly wanted to leave - and upon doing this gave this little town a soul of its own.  Watching this film, Stewart's portrayal of George Bailey runs the gambit of powerhouse acting.  Stewart, freshly back from the war, was worried if he could carry the weight of Bailey's cynicism.  His ability to care for Bedford Falls, while always dreaming of wanting to escape could only be portrayed through Stewart's Americana eyes.  When he screams at Mary, denouncing his desire to be on the ground floor in plastics, or when he yells at Potter's bid to join him - we scream with him.  This film works from an acting standpoint because we believe in the characters - we trust the actors to give us a slice of their souls for these roles - and they do.  One cannot fault anyone in this film for their acting and that is a rarity in today's Hollywood.<br /><br />Capra's eye in this film seems far more advanced than the credit he has received.  His enormous sets, the birth of a new "snow", and his ability to create a world we care for without having to travel the globe.  What I enjoy about "It's A Wonderful Life" is that Capra tricks you by the end.  Here we believe, outside of the brief opening, that this is just your typical drama, a man's life is shown in scope so that he can see his full worth, but then sneakily Capra brings in (depending on your religious basis) a huge science-fiction element that was unheard of during the time.  One cannot argue the validity of science fiction vs. religion in this film - since Joseph is portrayed by the stars and planets.  Sure, Clarence was an angel, but there is this aura of the supernatural.  Clarence offers no evidence that he is, in fact, sent by the man upstairs, so one has to question the time this film was released, the faith in spirituality, and the fact that Capra's Clarence could be alien, vegetable, or mineral.  This film teeters between drama and science fiction, while so many critics award this film the "feel-good" holiday movie during December; I find it a bit strange that perhaps this film lead to so many other science fiction movies of the same nature.  Perhaps the "Cloverfield" monster could be considered a Clarence to someone in New York City?  I may be stretching a bit, but what pulls me into this film time and time again is the fact that Clarence is not of Earth, yet George easily believes.  He listens, follows, and - with some resistance - does what Clarence orders.  This is a film without guns, without explosions, without the President getting on his red phone - but instead a film where a celestial being can visit someone without fear, anger, or confusion.  This is why I collect the "Alf" television series.<br /><br />Overall, "It's A Wonderful Life" remains in constant rotation no matter the time of year in my home.  The acting is superb, the sci-fi element seems fresh every time, and the growing fact that George Bailey is pro-independent business means quite a bit in this rushed Wal-Mart world.  Bailey, and this film, is the voice for the little man, the quiet shopkeeper who doesn't want to sell to Potter, but instead dreams of keeping their home-style values.  The spark between Potter and Bailey can be seen in every facet of today's growing world, as the rich continue to get richer - the less fortunate work harder and feel more held back.  Dreams are traded for jobs - communities are strengthened by friendships.  This film is a time capsule for the future, as we discover convenience overcomes customer service; it is nice to look back and see a world like Bedford Falls.  The science fiction element to this film, yep - that is what I am considering it - comes in sharp and remains powerful throughout.  Did anyone else see Jimmy Stewart's eyes throughout those scenes?  Brilliant!  While this film will remain a staple through the holidays, I persist that you watch it away from the holiday to see the real message behind the film.  Capra was a genius in creating this film, and subsequently crafted a cult film that will remain forever.  Even today, nearly thirty years since my first viewing, I am more impressed that ever.  It is a film that grows with you, and that is quite a rarity in today's cinema.<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Pretty Good...Not Real Original But I Liked the Characters"></head><body><p>Nicely paced thriller with a what-if scenario which was not the freshest but still entertaining. The characters were nicely fleshed out through believable motivation and the skill of the actors. As far as family friendly viewing, it was pretty mild without overt gore, excessive raw language or lewdness. The suspense might be too much for some, but overall this was a pretty good flick.</p></body></html>

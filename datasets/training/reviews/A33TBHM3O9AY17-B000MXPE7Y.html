It was obviously intended as a "serious" movie, and certainly pulls that off credibly.  On the plus side was the all-star cast, including Matt Damon, Angelina Jolie, Robert DeNiro (who also produced the film), Alec Baldwin, and William Hurt, among others.  Even Joe Pesci makes an appearance toward the end.  However, Jolie's and DeNiro's roles were a bit marginalized for actors who are accustomed to being the star.  Also, Damon seemed (in my humble opinion) to be miscast for the role of Edward Wilson.  He simply looked too young to be believable as a middle-aged man with a twenty-something son, and the birth-control glasses and fedora weren't able to compensate adequately.<br /><br />As to the story itself, I saw it as tracing not only the birth of the CIA, but the dehumanization of Edward Wilson, which culminated in the closing scene with the revelation of his father's secret.  As a spy drama, it is predictably full of intrigue, deception and betrayal.  Wilson is told over and over by other spies that he can trust no one, yet ultimately it is a lesson he must learn through hard experience.  All the while, the viewer watches with a vague sympathy as Wilson's life slips further and further away, as he is dragged ever deeper into the dark web of Cold War espionage.  Yet he is a willing captive.<br /><br />Damon's role was at once central yet maddeningly flat, with relatively little dialogue and a lot of silent, intense staring.  The storyline bounced back and forth between the main tale of exposing a mole who leaked the plans for the Bay of Pigs operation, and tracing Wilson's biography as a college student turned OSS operative in WW2, and later CIA counterintelligence officer.  One must read the subtitles at the beginning of each scene to keep track of the chronology, but even with that aid it can be very difficult to track this subtle and often highly nuanced narrative.  An example is the meeting between Wilson and Modin regarding Edward Jr.'s fiance.  One must read carefully between the lines of their dialogue to appreciate the subsequent scenes involving the young lady's "mishap."<br /><br />In short, this movie is worth seeing once -- maybe twice if you really want to be able to understand better some of the more subtle plot twists.  However, I found it to be too long, a bit dry, and not especially entertaining.  I personally wouldn't waste the time on a second viewing.</p></body></html>

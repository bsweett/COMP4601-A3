<meta name="summary" content="Collectors edition is Superb"></head><body><p>The Film is, without a doubt, a masterpiece of it's genre. The key however, is the FX  done by Rob Bottin. The Director admits that the work done by Rob Bottin, and also by the genius himself, Stan  Winston ( who admits that this film is basically Bottin's baby), makes things easier for the director when he discovered that Bottin's driven and maniacally perfectionist FX  work allows the actors, and the director to do their job knowing that they are doing so with a superb backdrop.<br />The location is great. The FX  are great. The Matte  Painting work is beyond superb.<br />The  Collectors  edition DVD  basically gives you thorough main shows, the film, the making of Featurette, and the commentary.<br />Through these features, you discover how the material was put together, how Bottin created what was such a superb pre-CGI master-work, and thereby a place for himself in cinematic history.<br />There are additional extras other than the three main shows I mention, but if you only watch the Three "Shows" I refer to, the DVD  more than pays for itself.<br />The packing of the DVD  is great, and it just feels like a work done by a Fan. The stories related by the actors are excellent, and the work of the masterful  Wilford Brimley, Kurt Russell, and the rest of the actors, make this a brilliant film, if only to see that a great film, done with passion and verve, can be made without the computers, without the Avid editor, but with passion, heart, and good old fashioned acting, skill, visual  dexterity, and a masterly script.<br />If you like the film THE THING, you are sure to love the Collectors  edition. Make sure to see it with a Surround sound 5.1  system, since the visual transfer is equally as brilliant as the audio.<br />ENJOY</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Was bad just like i expected"></head><body><p>I dotn really like war movies but I did like We where soliders and some other ones but I am nt a fan of them. Right when this movie came out I knew it would be bad and not good but people said it was good and some people said it was bad so i ahd to see and I was right it was bad. The story shows the bad parts of joing the army and how people lose loved one's for example the men all think there wives are cheating on them and they lose there wives as they have affairs and then they take there children away. The movie shows how you become brainwashed into fighting while your out in the field and sometimes nothing happends liek this movie and then they show how the men get all mad. The acting was the only good part of the movie the story boring the directing bad for an ocsar winner. Overall dont waste your time you'll be wondering where my 2 hours went.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="well worth the wait for this angle on Iwo Jima battle"></head><body><p>Whereas Flags Of Our Fathers falls flat, Letters From Iwo Jima rises to become certainly a front-runner as one of the best war films ever. The main reason this movie works so well is the acting which is beyond first-rate and the way the characters are drawn in a fantastic script. There are some "holy ____!" moments especially one suicide scene and a "flame-on" of a soldier in another. The way the movie was shot also helps evokes the barrenness of the real Iwo Jima and the way the island was turned into scorched earth.<br /><br />The extras are worthy of Oscar consideration as beyond the ubiquitous "making of" is a look at how they cast the film with the various Japanese actors' backgrounds and how they were chosen for their roles revealed. There is also thrown in the Japanese premiere and press conference which was a nice bonus touch (why don't more DVDs put those on their extras).<br /><br />If you understand Japanese (the movie is subtitled in English), they have tried to accurately recreate the way the Japanese language was spoken and used back in 1945 but early on you'll hear one soldier refer to Americans as "American" rather than "America-jin." That was sort of odd.<br /><br />Also, as a huge cultural insight into the Japanese psyche back then and comparing it to the way it is now will be endlessly fascinating to any person who has spent any length of time in Japan. I'll leave that at that otherwise I'm apt to go off on some social anthropological rant.<br /><br />Anyway, on so many levels this movie works whether you're a fan of war movies or not.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Fun - But a little familiar"></head><body><p>Pierce Brosnan is back in his 4th outing as the tuxedo clad suave English spy, and looks set to have sealed his name in  connection with Bond, in almost Sean Connery fashion.<br />Heavily SfX laden action sequences break up the usual one liners, and witty inuendo but this time, for a change there seems to be a real underlying tenacity and gritty toughness to the Bond character. The opening 5 minutes is almost brutal (and a little different in style compared to the usual openings) albeit a tiny bit annoying being overladen with the titles, but apart from that is extremely enjoyable.<br />A big problem with all Bond movies, is the comparison factor to those that went before, and although Brosnan is definiteley the right man, the plots seem to be relying heavily on older movies. In this outing James must save the World (again) from a madman who is using diamonds, to build a super space laser weapon, to eliminate the free world - sound familiar? Well yes it does, and the story is more than a little similar to Diamonds are Forever.<br />The next minor criticism would be the high tech gadgets, which are always usually pleasing (if a touch incredible), I found an Aston Martin that becomes invisible, something of a stretch and if one looks back, the really succesful movies in the series have not relied too heavily on high tech, or made them too fantastic. These minor grumbles aside, strap yourself in for plenty of action, high jinks, and good solid acting performances all round. Haley Berry is particularly fetching, and the latest bond girl (who has a brain as well as a body) adding much to the script and story.<br />The real measure of this movie is it's undoubted success had it NOT been a Bond movie, one feels that if the lead character had been Harold Smith instead of James Bond, the story and production would still have been great, and very watchable, even if the razzmattaz associated with it's release, would have been probably non existent. Let's hope the super spy keeps going for another 20 movies. Enjoy !!!</p></body></html>

This film has the same energy and spirit as the &quot;Batman&quot; movies, but what makes &quot;Superman&quot; a cut above the rest of the other based-on-a-comic movies is that this film has a heart.  Christopher Reeve is perfectly cast as the man of steel who parts from his father (Marlon Brando) and is transported to Earth to fight evil.  Gene Hackman is devilishly good as Lex Luthor and Margot Kidder shows spunk and verve as Lois Lane.  The DVD is also an attractive package: although the picture leaves a bit to be desired, the sound is so solid, it looks like it was recorded this year instead of 1978.  Plus, the features are a real treat, including a few featurettes, and the original trailers, which show how long a way we've come in marketing films.  As with all franchises, the Superman films hit a dead end and wore out their welcome, but the original is the first and best.  Recommended for all viewers.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A masterpiece"></head><body><p>All these years later and it still holds up to this day.  John Landis crafted a comedic and horiffic classic with An American Werewolf in London in 1981, forever changing the way werewolf movies, and possibly horror movies in general, are made.  The story, if you don't know it by now, finds an American student (David Naughton) surviving a werewolf attack in England.  Things get much worse though when he starts seeing his dead friend (Griffin Dunne) informing him to kill himself before the next full moon.  Loaded with sharp humor, incredible script work and directing (Landis has never done better), and superb makeup effects by industry legend Rick Baker (many of which still hold up today), An American Werewolf in London is an all time classic that deserves it's legendary status.  With a great assortment of DVD extras, and at this cheap price, picking this up is a steal, and it's a crime if you're a horror fan and it's not already part of your collection.</p></body></html>

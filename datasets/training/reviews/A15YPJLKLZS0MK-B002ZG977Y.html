<meta name="summary" content="Remake"></head><body><p>This film is a remake of the classic 1981 film of the same name. A near scene for scene remake= added or deleted scenes and with some new characters, with basically<br />the exact same plot but worth seeing. They added Hades as Zeus' brother. It had the same ending and again the same plot as the 1981 version. I thought it was an excellent movie.</p></body></html>

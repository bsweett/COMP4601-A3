<meta name="summary" content="Johnny Depp a Brand Name for Me"></head><body><p>No one needs my review of this superb film, this annotation is just a marker for those who follow my generally non-fiction reading and viewing.<br /><br />Johnny Depp has become an icon for me, a brand name.  One of my teenagers brought this home and I put it on background while doing paperwork, but the TV is above my desktop and I watched every single minute, stopping as necessary when leaving the room.<br /><br />I admire the reviewer that has researched Jack the Ripper more deeply and tells us that we have been let off the worst of the worst.  That's fine by me.  Between Johnny Depp's performance, the other stars in the cast, the over-all screenplay and the period depiction, this was simply a fine offering.<br /><br />I might offer that Heather Graham shows great promise, brining to mind such stars as Jodie Foster and Julianne Moore.<br /><br />I'd like to see more reviewers use the "Insert a Product Link" that Amazon offers, instead of just typing out the name of a book or DVD.<br /><br />Here are some examples:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F7CECK">The Libertine</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I0RQVI">Pirates of the Caribbean - Dead Man's Chest (Widescreen Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1841193976">The Complete History of Jack the Ripper</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1554045274">A Study in Red: The Secret Journal of Jack the Ripper</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1602396663">The Ultimate Jack the Ripper Companion: An Illustrated Encyclopedia</a></p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Wouldn't have much life without Kevin James"></head><body><p>Hitch is about a love doctor (Will Smith) who helps geeks get the girl. He's smooth and cool and Smith plays him well. However him working as a love doctor only gets interesting when Kevin James' (The King of Queens) character is introduced. That's when you get all the laughs and when the movie comes to life. He plays a nice heavy guy who's desperatly in love with a rich popular women. So Smith does everything in his power to make him cool. Their scenes together are great and when the movie works the most. The Smith story just isn't as good alone  without James so thank god for him. Don't get me wrong the Smith scenes where he's trying to get a girl but keeps messing up are pretty funny. James though with his goofy dancing and charm steals the movie everytime he's on screen. He's great in the King of Queens but also shows here that he could have a bright movie career. Him teaming up with the Rock could make a pretty entertaining movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A good solid movie . . . but not great"></head><body><p>The Last Samurai is entertaining.<br />I got involved with the characters and wanted everything to turn out well.<br />The action sequences are well done.<br />The acting is well done.<p>However,<br />The plot is formula.<br />The ending, while throwing in a twist or two is still predictable.<br />The moral theme has been done to the hilt.<p>In Short,<br />This is a good movie to rent, but I wouldn't spend a lot of money to add it to my collection.</p></body></html>

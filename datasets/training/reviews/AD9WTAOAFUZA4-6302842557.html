In "Amadeus" he shatters all preconceptions of his talents as an actor, deserving credit for fully realizing a complex, satisfying character with pure sincerity and wham-packed emotion.  He has guts that far outweigh Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham (the villainous Salieri who is contemptuous sarcastic, and jealous of the genius whose life is splayed before him.)  Hulce taunts, whoops and wallops the part out of the ballpark, with a childish relish that makes the audience long for the days when men wore white wigs and women corsets.  <p>The music is exquisite, needless to say, and Milos Forman once again proves his mettle as a fierce director - even "One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest" (Forman's first Oscar film) seems novice-like after you witness the depth and beauty of "Amadeus."  The film easily ranks as one of the best biographical portraits ever imagined from Hollywood, and on your DVD player, you'll experience SOUND unlike anything you ever imagined was possible.  Turn it up and let Hulce steal you away!  This is the perfect film for anyone who doesn't REALLY enjoy classical music, because here, the music is transforming and you become caught up in its lyrical melodies as much as in the story.  A wonderful film with a magnificent performance by Tom Hulce!</p></body></html>

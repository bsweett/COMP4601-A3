<meta name="summary" content="ONE OF THE BEST COP MOVIES EVER"></head><body><p>A COP [PETER WELLER] IS VIOLENTLY MURDERED BY A GANG OF CRIMINALS. SOON, A COMPANY NAMED OCP USES HIS FACE FOR A ROBOT THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE A PERFECT COP. BUT, PROBLEMS COME WHEN HE SEEKS VENGEANCE AGAINST THOSE WHO KILLED HIM AS A HUMAN. THIS EXTREMELY VIOLENT ACTION/SCI-FI MOVIE IS ONE OF THE BEST COP MOVIES EVER MADE. THE ACTING IS GOOD, THE ACTION IS GREAT, AND THE PLOT TWISTS ARE CLEVER. ANY ACTION FAN SHOULD LOVE THIS MOVIE. FOLLOWED BY TWO SEQUELS, AN ANIMATED TV SERIES, A LIVE-ACTION TV SERIES, AND FOUR DIRECT-TO-VIDEO MOVIES.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="IRON MAN went way Beyond my Expectations"></head><body><p>IRON MAN went way beyond my expectations. I was blown away. Robert Downey Jr. is incredible. He seems to get better with each film he makes. He makes Iron Man and true to life hero despite the implausibility of it all. He literally gives this character heart (no pun intended). IRON MAN is a thoroughly entertaining film thanks to a great script and Robert Downey Jr.'s performance. I like the way the film makers updated the setting and integrated the origin of Iron Man into the current socio-political situation in the Middle East. I was totally surprised how good this film was. This is one you just have to see. It entertains but works on such an emotional level and  that's what really makes it work.</p></body></html>

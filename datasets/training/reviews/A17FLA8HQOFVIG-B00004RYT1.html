<meta name="summary" content="A masterpiece which has stood the test of time.  Don't miss it!"></head><body><p>Now playing on cable TV, this 1960 thriller is one of Alfred Hitchcock's classic films of all time.  I saw it in a theater when it was first released and I will never forget its impact.  And seeing it again, 50 years later, it is still just as mesmerizing, even though, this time round, I was well aware of the plot.  It's rare a film can still be called a masterpiece after so many years.<br /><br />Janet Leigh sure was beautiful.  And we first meet her wearing a bra and half-slip in a motel with her lover, played by John Gavin.  They can't marry because he still has to pay alimony to his former wife.  This is an obstacle that seems impossible to bridge.  However, all of a sudden she's thrust into a situation where she has a chance to steal $40,000 from her employer and flee to her lover across the state line.  She's paranoid about the police and even trades her car in for another model at a used car dealer.  The audience identifies with her.  We expect her to be in the film all the way through.  But that is not the case after she meets Anthony Perkins at the Bates Motel.<br /><br />He's cast as an awkward young man who tries to please.  But there's something weird about him and his relationship with his mother.  And soon there is a unexpected murder that will be etched in the minds of moviegoers forever.<br /><br />Now the mystery really begins as Janet Leigh's sister, Vera Miles, starts to search for her with the help of a private investigator played by Martin Balsam..  The plot thickens.  So does the mystery of Norman Bates' mother.  There is not a wasted word in the dialogue.  And, even though I knew the ending, I was at the edge of my seat admiring the skill of all those who put this film together.<br /><br />With the exception of a over-explanation by a psychiatrist at the end of the film, this is an outstanding and disturbing work of art.  Don't miss it!</p></body></html>

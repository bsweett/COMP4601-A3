<meta name="summary" content="So, How was Marylin in the Sack?"></head><body><p>This is a great drama film! Elvis and a black man who believes that he is JFK battle a soul-sucking mummy in a Texas nursing home.<br />Horror purists have given this mixed reviews, and most fans of the mostly pathetic mainstream comedies will probably find it too &quot;weird.&quot; So, I'll just go ahead and classify this as drama.<br />Sue me.<br />The dvd contains some insightful commentary by Bruce Campbell and the director. What I really dug was the extra they had in which the author of the short story reads the first chapter. I am going to go back and find that author's name and seek out his work, from what I could tell, he writes wickedly.<br />Even if the premise sounds ridiculous, I believe that this film can be interpretted in different ways. It shows the horrors of growing old, and becoming forgotten in this country, and yet is also a tribute to the true American Spirit- bravery and loyalty and virtue.<br />Ask not what your nursing home can do for you...</p></body></html>

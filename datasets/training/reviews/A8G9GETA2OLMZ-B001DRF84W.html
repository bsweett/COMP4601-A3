<meta name="summary" content="Different from the Newer One, But Good"></head><body><p>I have seen both the Eric Bana and the Edward Norton "Hulks," and I like both, but I like the Bana version better.<br /><br />The Bana version is darker, slower, more psychological, and the computer graphics (the backgrounds, fades, etc., but not the Hulk himself) are very psychedelic and very interesting.<br /><br />The Bana version ends where the Norton version begins.<br /><br />The general in Bana is a much more complex and interesting character, and so is the Connelly character (Liv Tyler in Norton).<br /><br />In both, the graphics of the super-heroes are LAME.<br /><br />But I don't care.<br /><br />I would rather see a movie with an interesting plot and interesting characters than an interesting CG giant.<br /><br />I will say for the Norton version, however, that the long sequences at the beginning, in Brazil, are by far the best part of that one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Effective Tragedy in  Desperation"></head><body><p>'Monster' is a marvelous movie because Charlie Theron plays her character with such thorough knowledge and conviction that we are convinced that we're watching prostitute and serial killer Aileen Wuornos like it was done the first time.  Add to the fact that writer/director Patty Jenkins makes all the right moves to tell the story without softening or sermonizing, and you have yourself a movie classic.  Surely, it's not easy stuff to take in, but it's so interesting, one becomes glued to the heartaching tragedy in every detail.  Much like 'Dead Man Walking,' this film brims with authenticity and assembles itself with an unflinching camera and leaves the audience to judge in its aftermath.<br /><br />Having been a prostitute since age 13 and having been disowned and abused in numerous ways, Aileen can only earn a living on the way she was brought up.  Having to face a particularly nasty "John" she overreacts but at least has a plausible self-defense argument to muster.  Having a desperate challenge for tenderness and money, she comes upon a lesbian, Shelby (played with excellent tension by Christina Ricci) from a devout Christian household when she stumbles into a gay bar.  Trying a little tenderness her occupation lacks, she enters a relationship her original proclivities forbade.  Finding rare compassion her storage unit landlord, Tom (played effectively by Bruce Dern) and striking a partnership with Shelby, she, nevertheless, goes down a slippery slope; one that makes her a modern MacBeth with more fate following her than ambition.<br /><br />It can't be said enough how well-rounded and detailed Theron's performance is made.  Capturing pathos and desperation, 'Monster' reveals the rationalizations and roadblocks that make this story such a masterpiece in unsettling anguish.</p></body></html>

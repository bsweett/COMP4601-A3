And, cripes, that T-Virus sure is a real mother. The sitch as this sequel opens is this: a zombie plague has scoured Raccoon City, thanks to the ill dealings of the Umbrella Corporation, the world's largest pharmaceutical agency and just possibly the most diabolical global entity, like, ever. Precautions have been taken. Raccoon City has been entirely sealed off, the sun setting on a population left to fend for itself, probably feed on itself. Throughout the city, measures have been taken to ensure the evacuation of Umbrella Corporation's key personnel. The scientist who invented the T-Virus, for one, gets out safely. But his young daughter doesn't. At sunrise, Raccoon City is scheduled for a tactical nuclear strike. Some really heavy sunscreen is recommended.<br /><br />The story tracks a tiny band of survivors as they try to stay alive long enough to escape the city limits. It helps that this group is made up primarily of highly skilled operatives from the S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics And Rescue Service) unit and also from an Umbrella strike force. It also helps that the scientist who invented the T-virus is willing to guide them to safety, provided they rescue his young child. The odds for survival increase dramatically with the arrival of Alice, former head of security for an underground Umbrella complex. But it's a slightly different Alice than from what we remember in the first movie. She's been experimented on by the Umbrella think tank and she now demonstrates super powers. Another survivor from the first movie figures in APOCALYPSE, except that he'd been tweaked and probed and genetically engineered into becoming the terrifying Nemesis program. And no surprise that even with a city apocalypse going down, there are still fiendish Umbrella asshats bent on pursuing their messed-up experiments - such as pitting the Nemesis Program and Alice against each other, in a backstreet brawl, just to see who'd come out on top.<br /><br />Plot, sphlot. This is survival horror cinema, so one shouldn't expect too much verisimilitude or texture. RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE was designed with crunching zombie kills and gory special effects in mind. Sexy Sienna Guillory and Oded Fehr step into the fray as two uber-capable action heroes in their own right. But Milla Jovovich owns this franchise, and she again lends her fantastic looks and her palpable physicality. Milla is fearless when it comes to committing to her action sequences, and she performs a lot of her own stunts, including rappelling 60 feet down the side of a high rise edifice. She really anchors the film, drives most of the spectacular action set pieces.<br /><br />Plenty of gamers complained that the first film strayed too far from the video game, and here's APOCALYPSE attempting to atone. Consequently, game characters Jill Valentine (Guillory), Carlos Olivera (Fehr), and Nicholai Ginovaef are introduced, and the hulking Nemesis program is the featured Big Bad. The character of Alice was, of course, originally invented for the film franchise. The lickers are back, as are the gore hounds. Plenty for our good guys to shoot to bits. And, as ever, no dearth of the shambling undead, including a pack of flesh-eating school children.<br /><br />Mike Epps provides the comedy relief, but you should watch the movie anyway.<br /><br />What I have is the 2-DVD Special Edition with tons of bonus material. Disc one has the feature presentation with the option to view it in either wide or full screen and three audio commentary tracks (including one with actors Sienna Guillory, Oded Fehr, Milla Jovovich and Milla's unfortunate cackling - and they sure make fun of Germans a lot). Disc 2 has: 20 forgettable deleted scenes, 12 minutes worth; cast outtakes; "Game Over: RESIDENT EVIL Reanimated" - a six-part "Making Of" the film (focusing respectively on the stunts, the zombie choreography (the Undead Boot Camp), the sets, the weapons used, and the visual f/x); "Game Babes" explores the emergence of female action stars in cinema, showcasing Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory; "Corporate Malfeasance" is a featurette focusing on how the Umbrella Corporation bears real world similarities; "Symphony of Evil" is  a special effects montage; "Poster Gallery" showcases five submissions from the finalists of the online poster design contest; and there are movie trailers, including the theatrical trailer and teaser for RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE and the trailer for RESIDENT EVIL.</p></body></html>

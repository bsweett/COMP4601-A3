I hadn't until the other night seen this film, but I had heard mixed reviews regardless.  It's by no means a wonderful film, but its stylish take on the classic tale is a bit intriguing.  Depp plays Crane, a detective sent to unravel the mystery behind recent beheadings in the small town of Sleepy Hollow.  The townsfolk all know it's the work of the headless horseman, but Crane isn't convinced.<br /><br />Depp plays his character as only Depp could, with that awkward feeling permeating every move that makes his characters appear more natural than rehearsed.  Christina Ricci, who plays Depp's mysterious love interest, does a decent job as well, carrying her weight in a Depp driven project, but its Burton who really steals the show.  Tim is one of our finest directors, and as was mentioned, he is over-the-top, but that's what makes him so enjoyable.  There's no subtlety, and like with most of Burton's masterpieces it is layered with humor which adds to the atmosphere only Burton can paint.<br /><br />I didn't find this to be a scary film, not in the least, but it was an interesting film with enough entertaining value to keep the viewer watching time and time again.</p></body></html>

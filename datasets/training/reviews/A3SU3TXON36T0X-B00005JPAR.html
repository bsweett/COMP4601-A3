For in what day soever thou shalt eat of it, thou shalt die the death.<br /> -  _Genesis_ 2:16 - 7.<br /><br />_The Fountain_ (2006) is a movie directed by Darren Aronofsky which combines themes from various religions and science fiction concerning the fact of mortality.  Unfortunately, the movie combines these themes into nothing more than a syncretic neo-Gnostic porridge and thus fails to achieve any sort of redeeming message.  The film has three strands of development which make it difficult to follow, tracing the activities of a scientist as he attempts to discover a cure for his cancer-striken wife.  While the movie features themes from Roman Catholicism, the religion of the ancient Mayas, and Buddhism, it should be noted that the underlying message is ultimately Gnostic in origin - featuring the age old conflict at root in the Garden of Eden and behind mankind's Faustian quest for knowledge.  The film shows a Catholic inquisitor opposing the quest for immortality and makes the case that such figures are reactionary.  (We can see such conflict between moralists and those who support the diaboleries of the scientifically managed state today.)However, the film fails to note the contrast between earthly life and the promised life in the world to come.  The film also fails to appreciate the true meaning of the Fall from Grace in the Christian faith.  As such, the movie enters into the realms of the heretical Gnostics who sought to create God's Kingdom here on earth.  Christian philosophers have long warned against such attempts to "immanentize the eschaton" as Eric Voegelin put it and have repeatedly noted how such attempts have led to the various totalitarian political religions of our age.  (Such attempts are also at root behind the utopian urges that have given rise to the scientifically managed state.)  In his quest to achieve immortality for his wife, the scientist/conquistadore turns his back on the traditional Christian understanding of the human soul.  As such, this movie can only be seen for what it is, as a profoundly anti-Catholic film.  It should also be added that the blending of religious traditions makes for a disconcerting effect, with no clear-cut boundaries between each such tradition.  In this respect, the film reduces all such traditions to ultimate meaninglessness and thus fails to achieve anything ultimately lasting or worthwhile.  This of course is to be expected however given the fact that Aronofsky is an admitted atheist.</p></body></html>

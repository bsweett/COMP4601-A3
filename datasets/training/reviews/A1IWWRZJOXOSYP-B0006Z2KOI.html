In an era where DVD distribution is making foreign language films more accessible and giving them a broader audience, his timing is perfect.  This year his first American feature "Dark Water" starring Jennifer Connelly was released.  With "Central Station," "Foreign Land," & "Exposure," he's created an important body of work.  "The Motorcycle Diaries" does not strike me as intended to be a docu-drama, even though it is based on real-life people.  Dealing with the younger parts of the characters' lives, we see a more carefree existence set against the gorgeous backdrop of South America in Argentina, Chile, Peru & Venezuela.<br /><br />The film did receive its share of recognition.  The British academy awards recognized the quality of the film by nominating it for Best Picture and its stars for Best Actor & Best Supporting Actor.  The British academy did vote it as Best Foreign Language film.  I read it won the Oscar for best song, although I confess I can't hum a few bars of that tune. Jose Rivera's screenplay was nominated for Oscar's Best Adapted Screenplay.  It was produced by Robert Redford.<br /><br />As Ernesto "Che" Guevara, Gael Garcia Bernal portrays him as a serious and thoughtful young medical doctor.  Quite different than the cross-dresser he played in "Bad Education," Bernal gives one of the scariest portrayals of an asthma attack I've ever seen!  "Fuser," as he's nicknamed, is not a saint, as the scene where he attempts to seduce the wife of a man who is repairing his motorcycle for free attests.  However, he does become increasingly serious as he sees the plight of the miners, their treatment by the mining companies, and eventually works in a leper colony where even the Christian missionaries seem somewhat inhospitable.  His buddy Alberto Granado is the perfect foil, not as handsome and more portly, he swaggers with a delightful flare throughout this, his first film performance.  I was impressed in the DVD extras how Mexican actor Bernal did "pray" that Guevara would find his portrayal of his life acceptable.  The film is not a fast-paced film, but moves methodically and certainly, allowing the camera to linger on the faces of the people and for the care in their faces to sink in.  I thought it was a very good cinematic piece that provoked thought.  Sometimes if we seek to understand others, even if we don't approve of their decisions, it can help us to place them in the context of how they live.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

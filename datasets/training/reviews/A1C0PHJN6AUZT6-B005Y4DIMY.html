I had put it off for so many years because I thought it would be more sci-fi than horror, which I don't care for. After watching Bravo's scariest movie moments, I decided to take a chance and rent it. To my total surprise, I loved it! The story line was great, as was the acting, as were the scares. Shame on me for not seeing this years ago. I saw where so many future movies were influenced by this and was amazed. Someday, when someone puts out a list of things you must see to call yourself a fan of the horror genre, this had better on it. Not everyone will like it, but everyone should see it.</p></body></html>

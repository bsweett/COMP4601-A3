To Harry's frustration, Dumbledore doesn't help alleviate those doubts and suspicion because he keeps evading Harry.  To keep a tight rein on Hogswarts, the Ministry has sent Delores Umbridge, the Senior Undersecretary, as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.  However, she soon appoints herself as the High Inquisitor when she perceives things at Hogswarts as out of control and unnecessary.  Meanwhile, Voldemort and his army are getting stronger.<br /><br />Like other reviewers, I was surprised to learn that the largest book of the Harry Potter series has been reduced to the shortest movie of the series.  Both the Harry Potter books and movies are formulaic.  However, in this movie, some were deleted (like the quidditch game) and some were "fast-forwarded" (like the Christmas break from school & Kreacher).  Naturally, I was a bit disappointed.  However, I still enjoyed the movie very much even though I thought there was more dialogue than action.<br /><br />However, I just have 3 issues.  First, I enjoyed Umbridge in the book.  Her "hem, hem" has caused my friends and I to say that to each other, especially on AIM.  So, I was expecting that line to be the thing of this movie.  Instead, it was just replaced with some regular unoriginal coughs.  Other than that, Umbridge was just freakingly good.  Second, Gwarp looks more like the Jolly Green Giant than anything else.  Third, as the title says 'the order of the phoenix', there was hardly much on the order.<br /><br />Nonetheless, I liked it even though others felt it was so-so.  I do have to agree that there less action than the previous installment, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.  I'm already surprised that there is a movie poster for the 6th installment.  So, I'm looking forward to that.</p></body></html>

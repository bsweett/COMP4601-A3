<meta name="summary" content=""Good 80's Childhood Adventure!""></head><body><p>Sean Astin and more star in Richard Donner's 1985 adventure film.<br />A kid and his friends find a map and search for a famous pirate's<br />treasure. I've always liked this film since I was a kid and it's nice<br />to have it on dvd. It has good picture and sound plus some neat<br />extras. I recommend this good 80's childhood adventure.</p></body></html>

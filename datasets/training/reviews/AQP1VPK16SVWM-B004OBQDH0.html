<meta name="summary" content="Review for the Blu-ray--Great looking transfer for the Blu-ray the DVD included with the set doesn't look so great though)."></head><body><p>The Harry Potter films continue to get better with each succeeding film for me. "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part I" is the action thriller of the Potter films. Fans already know what's going to happen and for those who don't I'm not going to spoil it except to state up front that the film doesn't have a conclusion but ends on a great cliff hanger.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks exceptionally good--the image is crisp and true to the theatrical presentation of the film. The look of the film is much more subdued with colors that are often muted to reflect the much more serious and dangerous elements of the story.<br /><br />The audio sounds terrific with a strong 5.1 lossless mix.<br /><br />The DVD that is included has a substandard transfer. I'm not sure what Warner has thinking here as many people will just be buying the DVD (perhaps they were thinking that most folks would be watching the show on their car DVD players to keep the kids occupied).<br /><br />Special features include a featurette on shooting the scene for the seven Harrys. We also get "Maximum Movie Mode" the interactive feature that acts as a commentary track taking you behind-the-scenes of the movie while you're watching it.<br /><br />We also get a promotional featurette on the creation and opening of the theme park in Florida. There are a number of deleted scenes which while they don't necessarily add to the film per se do give us some additional character moments. There's also a featurette on the cast playing golf (!)which seemed kind of stretching. There's also a featurette on the recording of the soundtrack.<br /><br />There isn't a disc with a digital copy for those who use such things--you have to download the digital copy of the film. Demerits to Warner for advertising it on the package which implies that there is a digital copy disc inside which is a bit misleading. This isn't the first itme Warner has done this with the digital downloads--they did this also for a season of "Supernatural".<br /><br />The film certainly deserves five stars--it's a terrific, entertaining and thrilling ride. The transfer for the Blu-ray is stellar and the extras including the "Maximum Movie Mode" are good if not as exceptional as I'd liked (I'm assuming they're saving material for one of those "Ultimate" boxed sets).<br /><br />For those that are interested Best Buy has an exclusive Blu-ray disc that includes two featurettes that take you behind-the-scenes including the scene set in Picadilly and the location shooting of the film. Some of the interviews are recycled from other material on the set but there's also footage that isn't included in any of the other featurettes.<br /><br />Over all this is a good set with the film being exceptional. Potter fans will enjoy this set.</p></body></html>

I loved both actors in Speed, and have since been a fan of both of them, although they can be forgiven for some of their film choices (hello, Two Weeks Notice!) They had such great chemistry in Speed, but I was actually doubtful about the renamed Lake House, as from the plot, it didn't sound like they spent much time together in the film. In fact, it sounded quite similar to Sleepless In Seattle. I was pleasantly surprised, as though the storyline keeps them apart for a fair chunk of the film, they do end up talking.<br /><br />The whole storyline is somehow, Keanu's character Alex, and Sandra's character Kate, both lived in the same house, but at different times. Alex is in 2004, Kate is in 2006. Yet they manage to correspond, each disbelieving at first that they live two years apart. Then through various letters, somehow, they fall in love. (Or lust, whatever, bearing in mind they haven't physically seen each other.) They try and figure out a way to be together, they work out a date they're going to meet each other on, but Alex doesn't turn up. (You need to pay attention to the beginning of the film to understand why he doesn't turn up.) Then they both realise they've met in the past and various other incidents - Kate left a book at the train station, and she tells Alex to go and get it, and when she forgets it, she sees him picking up her forgotten book.<br /><br />The plot can sometimes be a bit far fetched, I'm still not sure about the ending. Not only was it a bit too Hollywood - although I think I would have cried if it had been any other way and that would have been embarrassing - but I think by the end it was actually set in 2008! But then it would have meant Kate's character was in 2010 - oh I'm confused!<br /><br />The only thing that really bugged me about this film was Sandra's hair. What possessed her to get her hair cut that short?! Dear God. But thankfully, now she seems to be putting on a little weight, marriage must be suiting her. She's still skinny, she always will be, but she's looking better.<br /><br />Suspension of disbelief is a really wonderful thing. It's quite good that's it's used in a romantic film. The plot is about connecting with your soulmate, the one that is right for you, especially when you feel isolated. Who hasn't felt they've waited too long to find the perfect someone, or felt alone at a crowded party.<br /><br />The reviewers who claim "bad acting" - shut up. There's always gonna be someone out there who slags off Keanu for his acting skills, but why are you watching it if you're just gonna write a review and slate his acting?<br /><br />See this film with someone you love. It'll open your eyes to what could possibly happen, what would happen if you never met them, and will make you look at them differently. It's an excellent, magical film, and I will be definitely preordering it when it comes out on DVD. And it's good to see Keanu & Sandra lighting up the big screen again. They make a good team.</p></body></html>

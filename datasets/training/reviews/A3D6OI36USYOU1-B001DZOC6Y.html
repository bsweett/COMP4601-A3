<meta name="summary" content="Let me recap."></head><body><p>OK, this is hilarious. A theatrical release that was generally panned by critics and rated a generous 2.5 stars by Amazon reviewers has already been pulled in favor of notice of the blockbuster DVD release scheduled for October 7. Can you feel the excitement? haw haw haw<br /><br />In case you missed it, or haven't heard what a monumentally bad and historically stupid flick this actually is, here is the summary as best as I can remember because I slept through most of the screening on the day of its release..... a sudden ill wind blows in allegedly carrying a deadly toxin released by the American Eastern Time Zone Federation of Angry Plants (AESTFAP), people become paralyzed, walk backwards, then begin to murder themselves (come on, these are NOT suicides) in the most gruesome manner available. Mark Wahlberg is introduced as a science teacher with an aloof wife (Zoey Deschanel) who remains aloof in spite of all the deathmurdercides going on all around her and the adjacent area codes. There is some mild scurrying about as Wahlberg and a few others attempt to figure out what is actually occuring, and as our hero is leading a small band of devotees to safety spontaneously breaks into a Doobie Bros tune to prove to a madman with a shotgun that "Everything is OK!" Well, everything's not OK cause shotgun go boom boom (advise your children to look away please).<br /><br />Actually, your children shouldn't be watching and you shouldn't either actually unless you are a one of these weird Shamalamadingdong "fans" I've been reading about or unless you're writing a paper on Bad Moviemaking 101. You see, the problem with this movie, aside from the bad acting and lack of a script, is that there is no villain, the Joint Chiefs aren't mobilized, there is no threat assessment, there's really not much of anything you can sink your teeth into except a ridiculous speculation that "the plants are ticked off and now they're fighting back!" Absurd right, and it ends just as it begins...stupidly.<br /><br />I am hopeful that the mucketymucks finally put this hack Shyamalbomb out of bidness. His films have gotten increasingly worse since the Sixth Sense (which some consider to be semi-overrated) and its time to just say NO to this clown. Go ahead and neg away, I'm doing a public service. 1 Pistule</p></body></html>

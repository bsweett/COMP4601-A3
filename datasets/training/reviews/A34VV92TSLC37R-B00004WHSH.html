<meta name="summary" content="An good, sometimes great finale for Stanley Kubrick"></head><body><p>Eyes Wide Shut is a very disturbing, intense film.  Well, I should say the last hour and a half are that way.  The first hour of the film is really slow, and if it weren't Kubrick, I would say it's even pointless.  The problem is, at the end of the movie, I look back on the first hour and all the conversations that took place, and ultimately I think that they make the movie what it is.  A disturbing, contemplative look at the human sexual psyche.<br /><br />Dr. Bill Hartford (Cruise) and his wife, Alice (Kidman) are a seemingly happy married couple.  One night as they are smoking some pot, they get into a substantial argument about Bill's view of women, specifically Alice.  This argument leads Alice to reveal to her husband that she almost had (or would have had, given the opportunity) an affair the last time they were on vacation in Cape Cod.  This upsets Bill and ultimately it is this story of desire that sets Dr. Bill off on his journey.  Obviously, the most famous scene is the orgy where Bill ultimately finds himself late one night.  While the American version has been censored substantially, the scene still does not lose its effect.<br /><br />Rather than go more in-depth in the story, I would just recommend giving the film a chance if you haven't seen it yet.  Cruise and Kidman give great performances, and Sydney Pollack has a good role as a friend of the Hartfords'.  The film is Kubrick in so many ways.  It relies on dialogue, music, and atmosphere to create tension, and it does an amazing job.  If anything, just make yourself get through the first hour, because from there the film takes off and you won't want to leave until you find out what in the world is going on.<br /><br />It really is a shame that this was Kubrick's last movie.  It makes you wish that he had made movies more frequently throughout his career, rather than just one every 6 or 8 years.</p></body></html>

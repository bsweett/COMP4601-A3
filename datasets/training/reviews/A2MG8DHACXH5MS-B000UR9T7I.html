<meta name="summary" content="Superhero Spiderman faces his Super Demons - himself"></head><body><p>Spiderman faces his dark side and a new enemy called the Sandman who accidentally killed his uncle. The Green Hornet is back and is out for revenge thinking Peter/Spiderman killed his father. In fact, there is revenge all over the place. Spiderman wants to get back at the Sandman... the Green Hornet wants to get back at Spiderman ... and Peter's photographer rival at the Daily Planet wants back at Peter Parker. Mary Jane struggles on Broadway and finds herself entangled in a love triangle with Harry and Peter while Peter faces his greatest enemy ... himself.<br /><br />The film never explains what the black slime is that ends up turning Spiderman into a dark figure. It seems to be from outer space and the ringing of bells drive it batty. The weirdest scene is when Spiderman rips off his black suit and it falls onto his rival at the Daily Planet. It makes him into the Anti-Spiderman and takes him over. This is the oddest part of the movie.</p></body></html>

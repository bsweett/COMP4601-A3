<meta name="summary" content="THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE (2003)"></head><body><p>In 1974, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE was claimed to be the scariest movie ever made. The film was a huge box office smash, spawning three sequels (THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE 2, LEATHERFACE: THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE III, & THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE: THE NEXT GENERATION). But in 2003, director Michael Bay gave us this incredible remake: THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE.<br /><br />  The movie starts off with some police footage of the crime scene where the massacre took place. Then seen are random bits of evidence such as glasses and paper with writing on it. We then see a police evidence tape that has a walkthrough of the HEWITT home. We see the officer guiding through the stairwell to the basement as he points out some scratches on the wall (which is shown later on in the film). We then see five teens swimming in a river.<br /><br />  The film flashes back to that of August 18, 1973, five college kids, ERIN (played by the sexy Jessica Biel), KEMPER (played by Eric Balfour), PEPPER (played by Erica Leerhson), ANDY (played by Mike Vogel), and MORGAN (played by Jonathan Tucker), are on their way to a LYNRYD SKYNYRD concert in Dallas. The kids are returning from a trip to Mexico, where Kemper, unbeknownst to his girlfriend, Erin, bought marijuana. As they are driving through Travis County, Texas, they see a girl about their age walking nearly in the middle of the road. After nearly hitting her, Erin insists that they pick her up, so they do. She is in some sort of hysterical state and babbles about a "really bad man". The teens take her in their car where she says, "You're all gonna die," before shooting herself in the mouth. The five teenagers are in shock. They find an old gas station and stop there to call the police and report the suicide. The owner of the station calls the sheriff for them, and she tells them that they need to meet him at an old mill called "the old Crawford mill." They drive to the old mill, but find no sheriff. While they are looking around, they find a young boy named JEDIDIAH (played by David Dorfman) living inside the mill. He tells them that the sheriff is probably "at home getting drunk." They ask if they can drive there from the mill, but Jedidiah tells them that the road doesn't go there, and "it's a short walk." Erin and Kemper take off through the woods to find the sheriff's house, leaving the other three teenagers at the mill.<br /><br />Erin and Kemper eventually come to a large gray-brick house in a field. Erin is allowed inside by the owner, an old man in a wheelchair with no legs, but Kemper is told to wait outside. Erin calls the sheriff while Kemper, fed-up with waiting, sneaks inside the house to look for her. While he is snooping around, he gets hit in the back with an axe and dragged into the basement by LEATHERFACE (whose real name is THOMAS BROWN HEWITT) (played by Andrew Bryniarski). Erin leaves without Kemper, who she assumes has already left, and heads back to the old mill. Meanwhile, the sheriff is already at the mill with the other three. He wraps up the body of the dead girl with plastic wrap and has the kids put her in the trunk of his car. Erin eventually makes it back to the mill just as the sheriff is leaving, and discovers that Kemper is not there. She and Andy go back to the house to look for him. Andy sneaks inside while Erin distracts the owner. The old man soon discovers what they are up to, and summons Leatherface, who chases them out of the house with his chainsaw. Erin gets away, but Andy's leg is severed and he is taken inside where he is hung on a meat hook in the basement. Erin arrives back at the mill in a panic where Morgan and Pepper are waiting inside the van. Erin tries starting the van, but it doesn't work. The sheriff soon shows up again, and spots marijuana inside the van. He orders the three out of the van and forces them to the ground. He makes Morgan re-enact the suicide, and then kidnaps him, leaving the girls alone at the mill with the van. Soon Leatherface shows up (wearing Kemper's face) and cuts Pepper in half with the chainsaw. Erin is chased through the woods until she arrives at a small trailer. She takes refuge inside the trailer, where a heavyset woman known as "THE TEA LADY" (played by Kathy Lamkin) and a pale thin woman reside. The skinny woman, who has apparently stolen a baby from a previous victim, gives Erin some drug-laced tea that knocks her out while the Tea Lady looks on. Erin wakes up back inside the Hewitt house. Immediately after she wakes up, she is thrown into the basement by Leatherface. She finds Andy on the hook, and in act of sympathy, kills him with a large knife. She then finds Morgan still alive and they escape from the basement with the help of Jedidiah, who distracts Leatherface long enough for them to find a cellar door that leads outside. With Leatherface chasing them, they find an abandoned house and hide inside. Leatherface finds them, however, and kills Morgan by using his chainsaw to split him in two up the middle. Erin runs out of the house and makes it to barbed wire fence. She crawls through, but Leatherface trips and cuts himself with the chainsaw. Erin continues to run.<br /><br />Erin soon makes it to a large meat factory. She goes inside, grabs a meat cleaver, and hides from Leatherface in a locker. When he comes by the locker she jumps out and severs his arm with the cleaver. She then runs back outside and is picked up by a trucker. She panics when they pass a familiar sign, so the trucker stops at the gas station to get help. While the trucker goes inside, Erin hops out of the truck and peaks through the gas station window. She sees the sheriff and the skinny woman with the stolen baby. The sheriff walks outside, and Erin runs him over with his own car, and then drives away with the baby. As Erin is comforting the child, Leatherface appears in the middle of the road, brandishing his chainsaw in his other arm. He slices the drivers' side door off the car but Erin is unharmed. Leatherface just breathes heavily from the blood loss and stares as the car drives away. The final scene shows the second half of the police tape. This shows the men being attacked by Leatherface in his basement. A few fast-paced shots of him fly by the screen, then we cut to the officers' funerals. We then have a look at the only known image of Leatherface and are informed that "The scene was not properly secured by Travis County Police. Two investigating officers were fatally wounded that day. This is the only known footage we have of Thomas Hewitt, the man they call Leatherface. The case remains open."<br /><br />  Now, the 1974 original film was awesome, horrifying, and very disturbing. But it doesn't even compare to the 2003 remake. This 2003 remake is way scarier, even gorier, and way more disturbing than that of the original 1974 film. This was an awesome remake that deserves 100 stars, not 5.</p></body></html>

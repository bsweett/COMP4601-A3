<meta name="summary" content="My Favorite Western of All Time!"></head><body><p>I wasn't a big fan of Leone's &quot;Once Upon a Time in the West,&quot; so I took a gamble and bought this new extended cut of &quot;GB&amp;U&quot; for a low price. I am truly glad I did! I saw this film once before about 8 years ago and I didn't remember it being that great. I can now say that this is not only my favorite Leone western, but my favorite western period. The acting of the three leads, the music (of course), and the storyline are some of the best ever in this genre of movies. The Dvd is loaded with interesting features, with Clint Eastwood and Eli (the ugly) talking about the fun times and near death experiences when making this classic film. This movie is a real testament to the west and the seal of greatness that will forever live on with the name Sergio Leone.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bill: "I took the father, now I'll take the son.""></head><body><p>One of the first great movies of the new millenium, GANGS OF NEW YORK failed in its initial run to earn back a $97 million dollar cost.<br /><br />Set in a violent NYC slum called Five Points, the story centers on young Amsterdam Vallon. When Amsterdam was a small child, his father, 'Priest' Vallon, leader of the Dead Rabbits gang, was slain in a vicious street battle by the Native Americans' boss, Bill (the Butcher) Cutting.<br /><br />The parentless boy is sent by his father's killer to an orphanage some miles away. When finally of age, he returns to the Points to learn that Irish immigrants still clash for control of their run-down neighborhood with the Butcher's forces. Young Vallon has sworn to avenge his father's death, but first he becomes Bill's prot&eacute;g&eacute;. His later failed attempt on the Butcher's life leaves Amsterdam alive, scarred and temporarily humiliated. After recovering from his wounds however, Vallon, as leader of the revived Dead Rabbits, challenges Bill and his minions to a formal rowdy-dow.<br /><br />Meanwhile, widespread riots and the lynching of innocent blacks occur when necessities of the Civil War impose America's first conscription act on those too poor to pay $300 for a military service waiver. The Army is called in and chaos reigns, even as Bill's Natives and Amsterdam's Irish meet in a grand street war to determine the future of their horrid tenement neighborhood.<br /><br />With an attention to detail that few motion pictures have every approached, director Martin Scorsese's superb modern masterpiece is equally brilliant in every other respect.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(7.4) Gangs of New York (USA/Italy-2002) - Leonardo DiCaprio/Daniel Day-Lewis/Cameron Diaz/Jim Broadbent/John C. Reilly/Henry Thomas/Liam Neeson/Brendan Gleeson/David Hemmings (uncredited: Martin Scorsese)</p></body></html>

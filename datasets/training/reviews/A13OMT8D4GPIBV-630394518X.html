<meta name="summary" content="One of the Best Thrillers...EVER"></head><body><p>Seven is a perfect movie.  The casting is brilliant and the acting is just as wondeeful.  Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt star as cops after a serial killer killing in the style of the seven deadly sins.  The script is just as brilliant.<br /><br />David Fincher put together one of the best movies in the last ten years.  It's atmospheric, creey, and genuinely terrifying.  A wonderful movie at that.<br /><br />The DVD is one of the best ever released, four (4) total commentaries featuring any and everybody that worked on this film.  Also included are featurettes, deleted scenes, two alternate endings, and plenty of other features.<br /><br />David Fincher has impressed me with his directing, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00012FXB8">Alien 3 (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003W8NM">Fight Club (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001AVZCQ">Panic Room (3-Disc Special Edition)</a> were just as wonderful.<br /><br />This is a definite Must Have.</p></body></html>

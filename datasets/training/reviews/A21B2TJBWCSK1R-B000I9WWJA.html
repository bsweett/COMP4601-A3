<meta name="summary" content="An entertaining and engaging heist thriller"></head><body><p>Spike Lee is the last filmmaker you'd imagine making a slick heist film for a major studio and yet that is exactly what he's done with Inside Man, a cleverly staged and executed thriller. What's even more incredible is that this intricately plotted movie was written by first timer Russell Gewirtz. Lee fans worried that he's sold out can rest assured that even though the filmmaker is working for a studio this is hardly your average director-for-hire gig. And, as if to reassure his fans, Lee has teamed up with Denzel Washington again - always a good sign as they work so well together (this being their fourth collaboration).<br /><br />Washington plays a smooth talking smart guy who is trying to figure out what the bank robbers, in particular Russell, are up to while dealing with influential bureaucrats, like White, breathing down his neck. He displays the ease and confidence of an actor in top form and is wonderful, as always, to watch. Clive Owen is also very good as the ruthless bank robber with a keen intellect. Is he messing with the cops? Is he following some sort of ingenious master plan? Both? It's an interesting role for the actor as he spends a good chunk of the movie with his marquee good looks obscured by a mask.<br /><br />One of the joys of watching Inside Man is seeing all of these A-listers interact with each other; all under Lee's expert direction. The plotting is complex and brilliant as Gewirtz puts a new spin on the "perfect crime" while also paying homage to other heist movies like Dog Day Afternoon and Quick Change. Best of all, like The Usual Suspects, he ends the film with a delicious twist that is extremely hard to predict. Inside Man is a solid, thoroughly entertaining thriller with a brain - a rarity in Hollywood these days.<br /><br />There are five deleted scenes that include more footage of Frazier and Mitchell interrogating the hostages and how they perceived what went down. There is also an amusing scene where Frazier and Mitchell discuss the meaning behind a Bob Marley song and also a collection of local news reports on the bank heist.<br /><br />"The Making of Inside Man" is a pleasant notch above the usual electronic press kit material. Producer Brian Grazer provided the director a way to work successfully with a studio, which he hadn't done for some time. Also included are excerpts from a cast script read-through and rehearsals that sheds a little light on the creative process.<br /><br />In what is quite possibly the most enjoyable extra on this disc, "Number 4" is a lively conversation between Lee and Washington about the four films they've done together. You can tell that they're good friends by the way they joke with each other in a relaxed manner. This is a fun, engaging extra.<br /><br />Finally, there is an audio commentary by director Spike Lee. For a director it's all about making choices and Lee talks about particular shots in the movie and why he chose them. He speaks fondly of the cast without being to sycophantic about it. This isn't the chattiest track ever recorded but Lee talks enough to make it worth a listen if you're a fan of the man and his movies.</p></body></html>

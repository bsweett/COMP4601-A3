But when you disregard any notion that this movie belongs solely to please those that are fans of the book you have a phenomenal display of magic and deep characterization that leads to a dark, tense film with enemies and a plot worth exploring. This film benefits from the most updated technology that swarms your vision with more colors than possessed in the most colorful rainbow. They broadcast(at least for me) a field of ambiance that has rarely been shown before. It makes me beg for the crystal clear brilliance of HD, or blue ray. The climatic duel near the end between wisened powerhouses was comparible to the lightsaber fight/orchestration at the end of RETURN OF THE JEDI. I was that enthralled. And the more aggitated Harry went along, a kettle boiling over, the more they hinted that Harry may not be the savior after all, the more I was attatched to the human storyline. All this being said, I suppose it's impossible to dismiss the quality of the book for those who adore them and have endured the endless pages by their favorite author, and to those hordes of people I sympathize by saying I understand completely. But at least you have more to come, be optimistic for the sixth movie. They may succomb to your desires and make it eleven hours long.</p></body></html>

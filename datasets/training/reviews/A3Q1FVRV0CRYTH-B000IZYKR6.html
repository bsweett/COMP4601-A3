This is the performance that the academy should really sink their teeth into but for some reason I highly doubt that'll happen.<br /><br />Haley is fourteen.  Jeff is thirty-two.  For three weeks they have been communicating in online chat rooms and finally they are going to meet for coffee.  When they do meet they realize that neither is what the other expected.  Jeff is a handsome and intelligent photographer, and Haley is extremely mature for her young age, a borderline medical student.  After some persuasion of Haley's part Jeff takes her back to his place for some drinks and maybe an impromptu photo session.<br /><br />Halfway through that photo session thinks turn ugly, and when Jeff wakes up he realizes that not only is Haley is mature...she's also insane.  The remainder of the film is a complete mind game between Haley and Jeff, Haley seeking revenge for the young girls he's abused and Jeff trying his hardest to get free.<br /><br />The film is brilliantly directed by David Slade, every frame holding and air of desperation and claustrophobia.  Add to that the tension between Patrick Wilson and Ellen Page and you have one of the most intense and gripping films I've seen in a long time.  The performances by these two are really the biggest key to making this film work for when they are the only people you see for almost two hours they can either draw you in or repel you.  I was drawn in, completely.<br /><br />As disturbing as some scenes can be (there's one scene in particular that would make any man squirm) the film is so engrossing the atrocity is easily forgiven.  `Hard Candy' is probably the best film I've seen yet this year, completely original and mind bending as it is brilliantly executed and completely entertaining from beginning to end.  Thanks to a smart script, brilliant plot and utterly amazing acting from the two leads we have been delivered `Hard Candy'.<br /><br />Page inhibits her character with enough confidence and maturity that she is absorbing in everyway, and Patrick switches back and forth through fear and aggression so well that you almost (I stress the word almost) feel bad for him.  Oh yeah, and the final frames of this film is so incredibly powerful and emotionally driven that you have no choice but to be completely engrossed and, for lack of a better word, touching.  The bottom line is that this film creates the perfect detour from modern-day mediocrity and delivers us one heck of a, dare I say, joyride.</p></body></html>

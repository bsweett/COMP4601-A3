<meta name="summary" content="MR. SERIOUS AMERICAN"></head><body><p>When I saw the movie at the flea market for a buck, I said, "What the heck, it's Tarantino." I had trouble following the movie due to a lack of confusing flashbacks (It's a joke.)<br /><br />Three guys are touring Europe doing guy things. They meet a man who tells them about a Hostel in a small isolated town in Eastern Europe where there is an overabundance of pretty women who have nothing better to do than to throw themselves at anyone with a foreign accent, and they love all Americans. When they get there (note "Pulp Fiction" on TV) it is true. Women who look like models unashamedly share sleeping quarters with men, give them drugs and have sex with them.<br /><br />One by one the men disappear (as do the Japanese girls) and are tortured to death, aka "Blood Sucking Freaks". Paxton (Jay Hernandez) the last of the trio demands to know where his friends are... The slaughterhouse was filmed at an actual mental hospital in Prague.<br /><br />Clearly not for everyone.<br /><br />Sex, nudity, f-bomb, torture.</p></body></html>

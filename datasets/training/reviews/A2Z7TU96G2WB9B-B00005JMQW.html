<meta name="summary" content="Good stuff"></head><body><p>This is another fine addition to the saga of Peter Parker.  Additions tend to underperform when the sequels are an afterthought.  The previous film felt like a complete story, but it seemed to leave open the story for this film.  After watching this film, the viewer knows (especially if the viewer is a fan of the story already) that there are many stories still to come.<br /><br />The story again touches on the theme of responsibility.  Peter is still struggling to accept that he has to sacrifice the things he wants because of the responsibility that comes with his superpowers.  He wants a normal life and wants the proverbial girl, but he must stand between the bad guys and the people of New York City.  Alfred Molina, in a great turn as Doctor Octopus, gives Peter a lesson and example in accepting responsibility.<br /><br />The writers have left several hints of future stories.  First, we see J. Jonah Jameson's son the astronaut.  Second, we see Dr. Connors teaching one of Peter Parker's classes.  For a comics fan, I can't wait to see the movie versions of these characters in the future.<br /><br />The film's focus is on Peter Parker's coming to grips with his responsibility and does not show as much of Doctor Octopus as I may have liked, but this is still a fine story.  I would recommend seeing this movie.</p></body></html>

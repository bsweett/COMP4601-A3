<meta name="summary" content="Well done, but such pathetic characters!"></head><body><p>"Sideways" has a lot going for it. Great acting, especially on the part of Paul Giamatti, realistic characters, and a very interesting subplot involving California wines and those who immerse themselves in them -- both as consumers and as students.<br /><br />The film is about a couple of middle-aged guys, one of whom is about to get married, who want to spend a week having a good time before the ceremony. Predictably, this means that the groom-to-be is looking to hook up with as many women as possible before the big day. His travel companion (Giamatti) is a gloomy oenophile who can't get over the fact that his own marriage fell apart. He compensates by crawling inside a bottle -- not as a drinker, but as a wine aficionado. Studying wine makes up for the great hole in his emotional life. The mismatch between the temperament and aspirations of these two men is what many find charming about the film.<br /><br />Still, I found the film disappointing. The gloom and aimlessness of Giamatti's character was almost palpable. And his sidekick's hedonism was less comical than pathetic. I couldn't find it in me to laugh at a man betraying his spouse-to-be so shamelessly, or another man who lived with so much pain. Still, the film was well done, if not the laff-riot it is thought to be.</p></body></html>

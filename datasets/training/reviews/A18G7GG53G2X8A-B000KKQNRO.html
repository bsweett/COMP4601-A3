<meta name="summary" content="Dan Brown's Blockbuster Novel Hits the Big Screen"></head><body><p>Was there ever a doubt in anyone's mind that "The Da Vinci Code" would wind up on the big screen? Dan Brown's novel of religious mystery and intrigue has remained such a literary phenomenon that a film adaptation had to have been ready right from the word go. Ron Howard should thank his lucky stars that he was offered the role of director; anyone who understands just how big a story this is would have killed for the opportunity he was given. The ones who turned the project down will probably forever kick themselves in sheer frustration, proof that you should never pass up a golden opportunity. I suppose there is a down side; in taking the job, Howard made himself vulnerable to the outrage of the religious community, specifically the Catholic Church. They've certainly been vocal in their hatred of this story, both as a novel and as a film.<br /><br />But at the same time, there are multitudes that support the efforts made by Brown and Howard. And now, they have this film to show for it. Obviously, it's not a perfect adaptation of the novel: several details regarding location, time, and discoveries were either condensed or altogether removed, most likely for the sake of keeping the film going at a reasonable pace. Fortunately, they're all minor changes, ones that don't in any way harm the intention or integrity of the story. Besides, we all know that film is a medium that requires story omissions and alterations when using a written piece as source material. It just comes with the territory. The trick is to remove or alter the right details, the ones that aren't crucial to the plot. The film succeeds in removing all that was unnecessary (someone must have kept a close eye on this during production).<br /><br />The plot: Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is a Harvard Symbology professor visiting Paris to give a lecture on pagan symbolism. During a book signing, he's called upon by Captain Bezu Fache (Jean Reno) to aid investigation of a murder in the Louvre museum. The body of Jacques Sauniere (Jean-Pierre Marielle), the museum's curator, lies in a particularly strange position, almost as if it were posing like a figure in one of Leonardo Da Vinci's sketches. But even stranger is the fact that Sauniere positioned himself that way before he died, as if he were trying to give a message to someone....<br /><br />Langdon's expertise on symbolism and the use of a museum-quality ultraviolet light reveal some pretty startling details, ones that set into motion a cross-country scavenger hunt. It also sets into motion a series of murders, accusations, and lies that point directly to Langdon, making him the most wanted man in all of France. But he's not alone; at his side is Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), a cunning cryptographer and granddaughter to the murdered Sauniere. Even though she hasn't spoken to her grandfather in ten years (due to her witnessing him engaging in an especially uncommon ritual), she knows that he was trying to tell her something, even in death. She also knows that he trusted Langdon for some reason (even though the two never met), and because of that, she's willing to help Langdon escape. But things get complicated when it's learned that Sauinere was part of a secret society, one whose history revolves around one of the most famous religious icons ever: the Holy Grail.<br /><br />They travel from one location to the other as they follow Sauniere's clues, obscure pieces of information crafted through cryptology. One clue leads them to a Swiss bank where they retrieve a very important object from its vaults, a kind of treasure box created by Sauinere from the sketches of Da Vinci himself. It's made up of a row of discs, each acting as a lock and containing letters of the alphabet. The only way it can be opened is by rotating the discs and spelling out a specific password. Any attempt to break open the device will result in the destruction of its inner contents, thanks to a simple but effective method of security. If Langdon and Sophie wish to safely open this keystone, they need the help of someone who's dedicated his life to the study of the Holy Grail. Here enters Sir Leigh Teabing (Ian McKellen), a wealthy, colorful British man whose knowledge of the Grail is beyond plentiful.<br /><br />But there's another side to this story, one that involves an ultra-conservative sect of Catholicism called the Opus Dei. The most prominent character associated with this group is Silas (Paul Bettany), an albino monk who takes his faith a little too seriously, believing he needs to be in constant pain in order to remind himself of Christ's suffering (he regularly whips his back with a cat o'nine tails and continuously wears a belt of sharp metal around his thigh). He's been given a mission from a mysterious, hidden figure called The Teacher: get the keystone away from Langdon and Sophie. It contains a powerful secret that they don't want revealed, something that could easily shake the very foundation of the Church as the world knows it. If they have to kill those who stand in the way of their goal, then so be it. Called in to help with this task is Bishop Aringarosa (Alfred Molina), a man whose belief in the traditions of the Catholic Church has made him greedy.<br /><br />It's this very portrayal of the Church that has a lot of people up in arms. To a degree, I understand the resistance; faith is a sacred, personal thing, and any negative representation will be met with hostility. But the naysayers need to realize that "The Da Vinci Code" is nothing more than a non-threatening work of fiction, having very little basis in reality (other than some names and dates). I wish they would understand that; only then will they finally see it in an entirely different light. Both the novel and the movie were so meticulously crafted, so finely and carefully structured, that it doesn't allow itself to be overlooked. That's because this is a puzzle story, basic yet incredibly clever in the way it presents an incomplete picture whose pieces fall into place as it progresses. That's probably one of the reasons why the story is so popular, and it'll most likely be the reason why this movie succeeds: everyone loves a good mystery.</p></body></html>

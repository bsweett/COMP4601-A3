From <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767821408">Bottle Rocket</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305428239">Rushmore</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000067DHK">The Royal Tenenbaums</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007UC8Y4">The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou</a>, and finally this film, THE DARJEELING LIMITED, quirkiness is a theme that runs throughout writer/director Anderson's repertoire. He also loves working with the Wilson brothers (Luke and Owen) as well as Anjelica Huston and Bill Murray. So -- not surprisingly -- Owen, Anjelica and Bill all show up at some point in this one. They are, in fact, becoming what I like to call "the quirky cadre."<br /><br />Anderson isn't one of those "in-your-face" kind of directors. He doesn't spoonfeed you anything, and this is both fun and frustrating. The fun comes from personal discoveries related to the scenes and situations he puts his characters in. The frustration is that sometimes the disconnects are too extreme.<br /><br />This time we have the three Whitman brothers, Francis (Owen Wilson, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNS0">Cars</a>), Peter (Adrien Brody, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KWZ7JC">Hollywoodland</a>), and Jack (Jason Schwarztman, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M06KJ8">Marie Antoinette</a>). Their father has recently passed away and the brothers take on a trip to India to find their absent mother. In the meantime, we get to witness the bizarreness of this family unit. Francis (Wilson) is a control freak who has to have every minute detail pinned down. Peter (Brody) is somewhat of a kleptomaniac. And Jack (Schwartzman) is a damaged guy stuck on a damaged gal (played by Natalie Portman, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007OCG4W">Closer</a>). The three boys try to rediscover their brotherly bonds by taking The Darjeeling Limited (a train) across India in search of their father's hopes for them and their mother's reasons for not attending her husband's funeral. There are some absolutely hysterical, funny, and poignant moments, sometimes all wrapped up in one scene. The one that comes to mind the most is when the brothers witness a raft trapped in some rapids with three boys clinging on for dear life. They put aside all of their differences and go into savior mode without thinking, and it is a defining moment within the brothers' lives. What comes after is funny and sad. They finally break free of their bonds to their parents and leave all of their luggage behind (literally and metaphorically), thanks to the families they meet outside their own.<br /><br />The main frustration most viewers might have with the movie is the music. There really is no connection between what is happening and the tunes (Anderson, I believe, just enjoyed the Indian music and decided to incorporate it into the film, and be damned what anyone might think). The extreme disconnect was very bothersome for this viewer.<br /><br />Even so, this is a good quirky Anderson film with great color shots (the train and the surrounding terrain), an uplifting story (in the end), and some fine acting by all (especially by Owen Wilson).</p></body></html>

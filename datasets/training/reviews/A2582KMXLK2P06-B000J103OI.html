<meta name="summary" content="really good"></head><body><p>I went in expecting a movie that was intended for women.  In other words, a romance comedy, or something similar.<br /><br />That's NOT what I got.  Instead I got a really good understanding of the amazing amount of stress that fashion models have to go through in order to stay fit and be as close to perfect as humanly possible.  Because of this movie, I found out that the life of a fashion model is NOT just a simple cakewalk, and that these models really have to work to be the center of attention in magazines and whatnot.  Having to go through life this way is not as easy as it sounds.  You have to dress correctly, walk correctly, have a perfect smile, etc.  Not easy at all.<br /><br />Meryl Streep plays an old lady who has the NASTIEST attitude I have ever seen someone have.  She isn't afraid to speak exactly how she feels, and the entire movie is about the main character (Anne Hathaway) having to stay focused and fit in with the world of fashion models in order to be successful at her job (even though she appears to be out of place in that kind of environment).<br /><br />I really liked the movie.  I laughed a bit, learned a lot, and thought everyone's performance was spot-on.  Recommended.</p></body></html>

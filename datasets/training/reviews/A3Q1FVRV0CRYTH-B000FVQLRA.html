<meta name="summary" content="The best that 2002 had to offer!"></head><body><p>Winner of the Golden Palm, should have taken home the Oscar, `The Pianist' is, in my humble opinion, the best film of 2002.  It's one of those films that truly speaks to me on so many levels and resonates with me long after I'm done watching it.  Adrien Brody's masterful performance was rightly rewarded during that years Oscar ceremony, as was Roman Polanski's brilliant directing and Ronald Harwood's excellent screenplay.  The heart of this film, of course, is found in Adrien's performance, a tour'de'force as they call it.<br /><br />Brody plays Wladyslaw Szpilman, a famous pianist who is on the cuff of fame when the Nazi's invade Warsaw and he's forced into hiding.  `The Pianist' chronicles Wladyslaw's perilous journey and sheds light on those who helped him along the way, those who put him up, provided for him and even those who left him to die.  One reviewer noted that this is merely a story of one man's survival, and they alluded to the fact that that was a bad thing.  I disagree for it's a wonderful testament to the will to survive, that will in each and every one of us.  Just because Wladyslaw may not have done anything overly important with his life doesn't mean that his heartbreaking and uplifting story needn't be told.<br /><br />`The Pianist' helps the viewer to realize the horrors of the holocaust, the fact that more than what you think you know happened.  An example of this is found when a group of Jews are stopped while they are marching to work.  They are all lined up and a few men are randomly selected from the group and executed.  This is an act I never gave to much thought to.  I think for the most part when we think about the holocaust we think about the concentration camps, which were awful in themselves, but even outside those walls these people were treated horribly.  Even just the constant mocking and random beatings are a true testament to the atrocity that was that dark time in human history.<br /><br />As a side note I wanted to mention that, while he's only in a few minutes of the film, Thomas Kretschmann pulls out such a moving performance towards the end of this epic film.  As Captain Wilm Hosenfeld, Kretschmann shows so much emotional weight in his few frames as a man who feels pity for Szpilman and his condition and helps him the best he can.  There's one scene in particular when both Brody's and Kretschmann's eyes alone speak volumes.  Just after they meet Hosenfeld tells Wladyslaw to play something for him on the piano.  That scene alone carries the emotional crutch of this film, for in Wladyslaw we see this fear and pain as he begins that slowly transforms to this remarkable release and in Hosenfeld we see this admiration and concern that comes over him.<br /><br />Other supporting actors that must be recognized are Frank Finlay and Maureen Lipman who play Wladyslaw's parents as well as Ed Stoppard, Julia Rayner and Jessica Kate Meyer who play his siblings Henryk, Regina and Halina respectively.  Michal Zebrowski, Ruth Platt, Ronan Vilbert and Emilia Fox, among others, show beautifully that some humans do indeed care for more than just themselves as they play a few of the people that try to help this man survive.<br /><br />I don't understand how anyone couldn't be touched by this remarkable film.</p></body></html>

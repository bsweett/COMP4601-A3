Brilliant thriller has it all: mystery, suspense, action, romance, humor, drama, and it's all placed into one ingenious, engrossing mix in the hands of director Curtis Hanson.  Hands down the best film of its genre and one of my personal favorites.  The three leads (Guy Pearce, Russell Crowe, and Kevin Spacey) deliver sharp, terrific performances.  Excellent score from Jerry Goldsmith.</p></body></html>

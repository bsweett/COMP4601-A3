<meta name="summary" content="Romance  Across the Galaxy"></head><body><p>The more I see this film, the more it confirms  how much I like it. As a film, I see it primarily as a romance. In the end, a man out of place in one world, finds his place in another, and one man finds meaning in his own world after a very traumatic event. The central force is the romance that one finds in a place across the Galaxy.<br />Comparing the Film with TV series is not worth it. The TV series is rightly stated as "MacGyver Versus the Stargate", since that is what it is set up to be. The film, however, is a stand-alone masterpiece.<br />Emmerich and Devlin team up, and produce a film that works on many levels. You can enjoy the many extras on the discs, however, the Von Danikan add-ons are just fluff. The heart of this film is an excellent script. The soul of it lies in the performers, and the performances.<br />You will probably notice some Emmerich staples, such as some truly superb performers who have appeared in other films by Emmerich and co.<br />The Sound on the DVD  is excellent, and despite some very minor, but incredibly obvious continuity mistakes, the story works. There has not been an intergalactic romance like this since FORBIDDEN PLANET, and both  STARGATE and FORBIDDEN  PLANET are excellent films, each ahead of their time, and both immensely for any fan of the genre.</p></body></html>

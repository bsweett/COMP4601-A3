<meta name="summary" content="Smash hit, and for good reason"></head><body><p>If you have somehow missed seeing this terrific action film with Harrison Ford and the inimitable Tommy Lee Jones (he won an Oscar for this role), then waste no time and see it now. It's a terrific update of the popular 1960s TV series of the same name, based on the real-life story of a surgeon wrongly accused of murdering his wife. In one of the most sensational action sequences ever filmed, Ford escapes from a the scene of a horrible wreckage (bus vs. train) as he is enroute in the bus to prison.<br />And off he goes, dodging the law (Jones) at every twist and turn, to find the real killer on his own.<br />Not only is it a great action thriller, however; it's also an intense and spellbinding character study, well-suited to the personalities of the two stars who play so well the roles of hunter and hunted. They come, of course, to have a mutual respect for each other.<br />Watch it now.</p></body></html>

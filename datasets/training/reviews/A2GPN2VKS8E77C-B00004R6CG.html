<meta name="summary" content="A Mind-Bending Classic From The Master Of Suspense. Star Performances By James Stewart And Kim Novak."></head><body><p>Released in 1958, "Vertigo" was not a box-office hit as the 30-minute documentary "Obssesed With Vertigo" says. The film itself is a masterpiece, right up there with "Psycho," "Rear Window," "To Catch A Thief" and "Rebecca" (a masterful adaptation of the novel by Dame Daphne DuMaurier starring Laurence Olivier [fresh from his double success as Heathcliff in William Wyler's production of "Wuthering Heights" the previous year & his cold and calculating, yet sensitive Mr. Darcy in "Pride & Prejudice" the same year] and Joan Fontaine; please see my review on it). The story needs no rehashing, as the indelible performances of Stewart and Novak speak for themselves, along with Bernard Herrman's haunting score. The DVD also includes 2 trailers, original storyboard designs and a foreign censorship ending, shot by Hitchcock against his better judgment, under pressure from foreign distributors who opted for a more conventional ending. Rated PG for thematic elements.</p></body></html>

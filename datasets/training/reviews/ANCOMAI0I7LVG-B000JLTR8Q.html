Well, I say that and I must say that this particular film caused me to extract all that faith and I have not seen a single film by the director since.  That said, it bothers me that I find a sense of strange excitement when I see his name, as if maybe, just maybe this next offering will be the real follow up to `Unbreakable'.<br /><br />And then he releases that `Airbender' movie, further cementing my thoughts on his `has been' status.<br /><br />`Lady in the Water' was the last film I've seen by the `one hit wonder' director.  I must admit that when I first saw the trailer for the film I was sitting firmly on the fence.  I had just witnessed the underwhelming (yet not without a sliver of merit) `The Village' and so my expectations weren't particularly high, and yet the film looked ridiculously intriguing.  It looked dark and mysterious and developed and despite the scathing review in my EW magazine, I threw caution to the wind and jumped right in.<br /><br />The film is such a sloppy mess I'm just utterly disgusted.<br /><br />The film runs that sick line between underdeveloped and overdeveloped.  The storyline is so contrived and thick with unnecessary details that the actual depth of `story' is non-existent.  It is 100% gimmick with no real development of themes and moral.  It felt like Shyamalan was trying to write the skeletal basis for a videogame, a RPG in the vein of `Final Fantasy', which would have been ideal had this actually been a videogame, but it's not; it's a movie (and a horribly bad one at that).<br /><br />For those of you interested, here is a quick synopsis:<br /><br />A sea-nymph (also called a narf) must return to the blue world via `The Great Etlon' only after inspiring a man to write something that will change the face of the world while she contends with creatures called skrunt's who will stop at nothing to kill her, even risking their own lives at the hands of three monkey like guardians.  This narf is aided in her escape from the skrunt's by a group of humans. Each of these humans has a specific title or job. There has to be a translator, a guardian, a healer and a guild or group of people.  These characters are so convoluted that they make NO SENSE whatsoever and so while your brain is on overload trying to process the ridiculous storyline you are disappointed in the fact that nothing is strung together well enough to make it all valid.<br /><br />In a film that defies logic by bombarding the viewer with an `original' script (that's a stretch of the term), the film is bathed in clich&eacute;s that strip it of any true originality.<br /><br />It's `originally' stupid, if that helps at all.<br /><br />I had so much hope for Shyamalan.  He really had so much promise.  He has exhausted his own potential by delivering one flop after the next, each more convoluted and preposterous as the one before it.<br /><br />Hey, at least the visuals were `good'.</p></body></html>

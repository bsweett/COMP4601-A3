<meta name="summary" content="Aaron Eckhart triumphs in smartest satire in years"></head><body><p>Jason Reitman may have gotten into movies via nepotism (his dad is Ivan Retiman of "Ghostbusters" fame), but with "Thank You for Smoking," he proves that he belongs in the game.  This is one of the smartest, funniest satires in years.<br /><br />Two things make the movie work.  The first is Reitman's restraint.  This is a movie about smoking, and yet we don't get any of the obvious scenes of people miserably puffing away on cigarettes, slowly killing themselves for our amusement.  Instead, nobody really smokes in the movie - the best humor in this situation, lies in America's hypocrisy about smoking rather than the act of smoking itself.<br /><br />"Thank You For Smoking" examines the ludicrous truth that one of America's most profitable industries essentially kills 1,200 people a day.  And why does it do so?  For several reasons, but mainly because Americans are sheep willing to be sheared, so long as we are told what we want to hear.<br /><br />Enter Nick Naylor, played perfectly by Aaron Eckhart ("In the Company of Men," "Erin Brockavich").  Naylor is head spokesman for the tobacco industry, and he was born to do it.  The self-proclaimed Michael Jordan of spin can go onto a TV talk show, face an audience of sanctimonious nitwits who want nothing more than to boo the evil tobacco industry, and walk off the stage having received the handshake of a teenaged lung cancer victim and also having created the impression that the tobacco industry cares more about its customers' lives than the public interest groups who merely want a martyr.<br /><br />Naylor is riding high, and becomes the heir apparent to the Colonel (Robert Duvall), Mr. Big in Big Tobacco.  Naylor goes to Hollywood to negotiate with Mr. Hollywood (Rob Lowe) about getting cigarettes back into movies.  Naylor does this while lunching with fellow MOD Squad ("Merchant of Death") members, lobbyists representing alcohol and firearms, and trying to educate his son about what is great about America.  Our greatness boils down to two things, Naylor tells his son - our endless appeals system, and the fact that if you can argue correctly, you are never wrong.<br /><br />Eckhart nails this role (pardon the pun).  What makes this a great performance is that Eckhart does not play Naylor as a true believer, either in tobacco or the morality of the game he plays.  He is just very, very good at his job, and he's got a mortgage.  "99% of what goes on in the world, for good or evil, is motivated by the fact that people have to pay the mortgage."<br /><br />Naylor's life takes a sudden turn south as he is (a) threatened with murder (and there is something about the threat that makes it realistic) and (b) starts sleeping with a probing journalist (Katie Holmes), when he should know better than nothing will be 'off the record.'  But these two scenarios merely create a higher wire for our acrobatic hero to negotiate, and he does so with style and panache.<br /><br />"Thank You For Smoking" may make you shift uncomfortably in your seat a few times, but it will make you laugh a heck of a lot more.  And, rarest of all for movies these days, it will make you think.  What a great movie.</p></body></html>

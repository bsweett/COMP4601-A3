This gets the same score from me.<br /><br />The good:<br />As I say its a good cast - the addition of Derek Jacobi adds some depth to the movie. The special effects are very well done, with Marcus being a marvellous winged creation whose endearing habit of spearing people remains a highlight. The opening prequel sequence set hundreds of years before is well done and sets up the story well.<br /><br />The bad:<br />As with the first film this is a little lacking in sympathetic characters. Now fair enough they are all vampires or werewolfs but even so I think the makers could have made a bit more effort. Rather inconsistenly throughout the film Selene (Kate Beckinsale) remains the beautiful bewitching vampire. Even when provoked she never turns into a winged beast like the men do. Perhaps female vampires are different? Towards the end I began to get a little tired of Selene picking up yet another gun or machine gun and pointlessly shooting it into her opponents with little effect. At best its a distraction, so why continue to show it throughout the film....<br /><br />Having said all that, it is a rollercoaster ride, and if you like the subject matter (which I do) there is no doubt you will enjoy this a lot.<br />Its worth seeing the first movie first as this does continue directly on from that film.</p></body></html>

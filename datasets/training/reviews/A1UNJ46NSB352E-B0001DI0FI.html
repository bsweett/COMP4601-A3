You don't even see the enemy...and that's the beauty of the movie.  Russell Crowe and Paul Bettany are such great actors and they can carry a film like this, with no sign of the enemy.  After seeing this movie, I find it amazing that sea battles actually had any survivors.  The action is intense and the sound is simply amazing.  The DVD has both a DTS and Dolby 5.1 tracks, and they are some of the best sound mixes out there.  I highly recommend this DVD.</p></body></html>

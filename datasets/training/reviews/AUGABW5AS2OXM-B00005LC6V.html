<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Modern Horror Movie!"></head><body><p>This was an excellent remake of an old horror movie.The actors in this movie played their roles well. A young man in London is<br />bitten by a werewolf. He promptly turns into a werewolf. He goes<br />on a killing spree that has London in a state of panic.He even<br />kills his friend.The makeup job that is used on hid friend is absolutely frightening.The special effects that are used in this movie are absolutely first notch. I watched this movie when it<br />first came out. It was good then and it is good now.The scenery of London is also very good. Watch this film. You will be as carried away as i was. Buy it.</p></body></html>

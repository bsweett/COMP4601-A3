Meanwhile, the rebels have returned to the city of Zion to learn that 250,000 sentinels are digging towards them in order to seek Zion and wipe out the human resistance. The Oracle gives Neo instructions to find the keymaker and seek out the source. If Neo fails the mission, the rebellion will be crushed and the machines will win the war.<br />I've seen some bad movies, but this one was terrible.</p></body></html>

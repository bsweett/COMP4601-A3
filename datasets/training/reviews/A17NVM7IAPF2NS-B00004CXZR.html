But before we do that, let's take a shuttle to the Enterprise&quot; (because the transporters are conveniently down) &quot;and show broad, wide, sweeping shots of the Enterprise that eats up so much screen time that it's a wonder that this mysterious cloud hasn't consumed us whole by now!!&quot;<p>In fact, Kirk seems so caught up by the majesty of the Enterprise that it's a wonder that he seems to be in such a hurried rush later.<p>Oh, and don't get me started about the acting in various scenes.<p>My favorite is the Enterprise's reaction to the cloud's effect on the visual screen--it just seems to be a shocked, drunken stupor and you can almost hear the &quot;Wow...that was not good, right?&quot; coming from every face in the room.<p>The wormhole scene...owwwwwww.  Tension is simply caused because you are waiting for someone to spout off a line, NOT because you're actually worried about the meteor hitting the ship.<p>The costumes are painful to watch and it's easy to tell who is male or female in THIS chorus line.  Thank heavens for the dramatic costume improvement from Star Trek II onwards.<p>There are some good moments, but if you're looking for something to nap and wake up occasionally for plot, then this is your flick.</p></body></html>

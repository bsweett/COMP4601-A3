<meta name="summary" content="Great Performances in an Otherwise Safe Film"></head><body><p>"A Beautiful Mind" has been the subject of much pre-Oscar controversy; some of the charges against this film are more valid than others.  Critics have been coming out of the woodwork and accusing director Ron Howard of dodging some throny issues in his film biography of math wizard John Nash (accusations have ranged from Nash's alleged homosexuality to even anti-semitism).  In addition, the casting of Jennifer Connelly as Nash's long suffering wife has provoked the wrath of some in the Latino community (Nash's wife is really from El Salvador).  Regardless of the above, "A Beautiful Mind" is a good film on its own terms.  Russell Crowe gives a powerhouse performance as the professor suffering with scizophrenia.  This must have been a tricky role to play, but Crowe pulls it off without faking a single move.  Jennifer Connelly was better in the far edgier "Requiem for a Dream," but she shines in her role as the long-suffering wife.  Howard competently directs the film with feeling and at a reasonable pace, although the spotlight really belongs to Crowe.  I wouldn't look to this film for hard facts on Nash, but nonetheless I recommend it on the strength of the film's stellar performances.</p></body></html>

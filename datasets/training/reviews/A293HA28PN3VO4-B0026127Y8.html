<meta name="summary" content="Action packed, UK Blu-Ray 4/5 PQ, 5/5 AQ"></head><body><p>I missed this flick in theaters but saw it last night on BD (UK ed). Fox presents an adequate transfer (unfortunately rather rare for the studio), but the DTS sound was a pleasure. It was watched on a 42" Panasonic Plasma and Panasonic BD35 player. Given the extensive fighting, shooting, and other action scenes, I thoroughly enjoyed the DTS treatment. The picture was grainy in some dark shots, but overall very crisp.<br /><br />Though some reviews across numerous sites have remarked that Liam Neeson was an odd cast for this highly physical film, I disagree. In order to take on an underground women prostitution smuggling ring, singlehandledly, a mature, seasoned and perfection-driven type would need to be cast. He portrayed the girl's father and his skillset in a convincing manner.<br /><br />The pace of the film is very fast, and was a bit too fast for me, in rushing along the character development. The acting was a bit robotic in parts, especially of the daughter, who seemed overly excited and hysterical in normal scenes (not after she had been kidnapped, obviously). In parts it seemed like the director or actors "tried too hard" to create drama, and whether in the script, or the execution, it was a little "over the top". The story was over the top, of course, and quite dramatic, but the delivery seemed a bit overblown.<br /><br />Still, I can see how this was dubbed one of the best action movies of the year, as the centerline story of a dad fighting for his daughter in a very dangerous situation is a very powerful concept for humanity. The story was relatable and fast paced. Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

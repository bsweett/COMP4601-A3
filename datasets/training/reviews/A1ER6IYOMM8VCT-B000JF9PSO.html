<meta name="summary" content="AS A MOVIE THIS MISSED THE MARK!"></head><body><p>My rating for this film is as a "film". I am in no way trying to disrespect the tragedy or the families of the heroes on this plane. I just didn't think this was a very good movie. It's not well executed and when it was over, I was mad and ready for some revenge! Of course this is the intended response and the manipulation of the audience by the film makers is just plain shameful! This felt like a bad TV movie and the viewers can't help but feel sad and angry while watching this movie. It's the equivalent to making a film about Jonbenet Ramsey back when the crime was fresh and having a graphic murder/sex scene showing the poor child's horrible demise! The DVD transfer looks very good, but I liked World Trade Center much more than this.</p></body></html>

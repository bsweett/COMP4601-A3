It just continues to bring a smile to my face no matter how many times I see it (which is a lot considering my daughter's fascination with it).  The crude-like animation (it's pretty, but it's also clunky in an odd way) and the dead-pan humor add to the enjoyment factor because this feels like a perfect balance of adult and child entertainment.<br /><br />Nothing will go over their heads, and nothing will fly under yours.<br /><br />The film follows an oddly mismatched group of animals who form a bond while living out their lives in the New York Zoo (depicted as like the smallest zoo in the history of forever).  One of those `friends' is Marty, a zebra who loathes the confines of his `area' and dreams of running free in his homeland.  His best friend is Alex, the conceited and self-centered lion who is the prime attraction of the zoo, and he takes that rather seriously.  Gloria, the hippo, is soft hearted yet opinionated and Melman is a germaphobic and paranoid giraffe.  Together, they make a fun group who wind up being shipwrecked on the island of Madagascar after a botched escape plan lands them on a boat headed for Kenya that is hijacked by penguins and rerouted.<br /><br />Yes, it's that kind of movie.<br /><br />Once on the island, Alex becomes devastated and irritated while Marty soaks it all in like he's hit the jackpot.  Then, they meet the lemurs and the lunacy begins as their leader tries to use the island's new inhabitants as cyphers for the island's dreaded carnivores.<br /><br />The music is fun, the voice acting is genius (especially on the part of Sacha Baron Cohen, David Schwimmer and Chris Miller) and the overall enjoyment factor is really, really high here.  This is a film the whole family can and will enjoy, from start to finish.<br /><br />We like to move it!</p></body></html>

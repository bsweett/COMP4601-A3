<meta name="summary" content="AS GOOD AS I COULD HAVE POSSIBLY EXPECTED"></head><body><p>No need to say more about this film other than it is as good as could be expected from the teaming of Denzel, Crowe and Ridley Scott. Be aware though of the high level of truly repulsive violence in it, no matter how much it is an integral part of the story. I noticed people literally jumping out of their seats at the theater I saw it in, funny thing is, when a single animal is killed in the movie they decided not to show it on camera, I guess movie goers are a lot more offended by the killing of animals than that of people in films.<br />With the possible exception of "A Good Year" which wasn't that bad but wasn't great eiter, it seems like Russell Crowe hasn't made anything but great, great films in the past 10 years, starting with LA Confidential and up to this one. He has to be the biggest sure thing in Hollywood these days.</p></body></html>

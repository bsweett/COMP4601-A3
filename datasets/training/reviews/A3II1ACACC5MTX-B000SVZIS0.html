A little more effort in filling in plot holes would have been nice though, although the ending (spoiler warning) was made as it was to spawn a sequel, it was annoying to have had them miss out on the opportunity to make an "Aperaham Lincoln" gag, which was of course mighty frustrating. The thing that annoyed me most about the film was that the humans could speak, for me, the original 1968 film had Charlton Heston's main shocking capacity to the apes, was not that he was a spaceman, but that he could talk. By having everyone being able to talk, it immediately robs Leo Davidson's character of the one thing that would have made him uniquely interesting and that bothers me. The idea that the apes and humans had originated from the crashed ruins of the Oberon was another rather elegant plot twist that impressed me, the fact that the crew reported that the revolting apes had overcome them was a little paradox however, it would have been better if the computer log had said that they were abandoning the wreckage of the ship (or the ship, I am unclear if it had crashed before the ape mutiny) and going off to found a colony somewhere. And where did the horses come from? Don't tell me that on the Oberon, the apes were doing the exploration, and presumably the horses were in charge of repairing the ship or something? A little more care and thought would have made this a decent film, but even so, it really not that bad, I enjoyed watching it for the second time (after seeing at the flicks in 2002) more than I thought I would. And one last thing, as if a big mighty gorilla would less an tiny chimp boss him around. If I was one of the gorillas, I would have told general Thade to get stuffed.<br /><br />Its always hard to remake such an iconic film as Planet of the Apes, but this is a decent enough effort.</p></body></html>

It isn't the Coen Brothers' best work, and I certainly don't think it deserved to beat out films like "Atonement" and "Michael Clayton" for the Academy Award for Best Picture.<br /><br />This movie, which is based on a Cormac McCarthy novel, is a modern-day western involving a Vietnam vet, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), who finds a case containing $2 million in the desert...surrounded by a bunch of dead bodies. Llewelyn opts to take the money and run, but unfortunately for him, a big, burly guy toting a cattle gun (Javier Bardem) is hot on his tail. The whole film basically revolves around this chase, with Llewelyn generally being one step ahead until the very end.<br /><br />I though the movie was interesting, and was especially impressed by Bardem's eerily calm performance. The film boasts a strong supporting cast, including Tommy Lee Jones and Kelly Macdonald, but none of them were brilliant enough to save this movie for me. The entire film is very slow-paced, and the ending is incredibly abrupt and thoroughly unsatisfying. I really expected more, and was ultimately disappointed.</p></body></html>

The range of queen to a private woman with doubts & desires is exquisite.  Blanchett played in the 1998 film "Elizabeth" & was nominated for an Oscar.  She won Best Supporting Actress for "The Aviator" in 2004 and was nominated for "Notes on a Scandal" in 2006.  She centerpieces the film.<br /><br />An array of excellent players includes Clive Owen as Walter Raleigh. Nominated for Best Supporting Actor in 2004 for "Closer," Owen flirtatiously woos Elizabeth.  Geoffrey Rush plays Sir Francis Walsingham who connives adeptly.  Rush won Best Actor for "Shine" in 1996, nominated again in 2000 for "Quills."<br /><br />Australian beauty Abbie Cornish, memorable in "Somersault" and played in "A Good Year" with Russell Crowe, portrays Elizabeth's closest attendant, Bess Throckmorton.  With stunning good looks, she displays great range from the official to personal with Sir Walter to concern for her cousin.<br /><br />Her cousin Francis Throckmorton is played by Steven Robertson.  In brief scenes, he is memorable, urging Bess to help him regain favor with the Queen and in torture as Rush's Walsingham wrenches information from him.  Robertson had a small role in Orlando Bloom's "Kingdom of Heaven."<br /><br />Eddie Redmayne, who was Matt Damon's son in "The Good Shepard," plays Thomas Babington who attempts to assassinate Elizabeth with an unloaded gun.  He's great face-to-face with Blanchett.<br /><br />Samantha Morton has 5 films this year & plays Queen Mary Stewart of Scotland with regal bearing and the nervous repose of a political plotter.  I'll always recall her looking at Tom Cruise in "Minority Report" and shouting "RUN!"<br /><br />Shekhar Kapur directs as with the 1998 "Elizabeth."  He has since directed "The Guru" and "The Four Feathers."  Michael Hirst wrote the screenplay for the 1998 "Elizabeth."  He is joined by William Nicholson who has screenwriting Oscar nominations for "Shadowlands" (1993) & "Gladiator" (2000).<br /><br />The wonderful cinematography from colorful pageantry to somber prisons is by Remi Adefarasin who shot the 1998 film plus Woody Allen's 2005 "Match Point" & Michael Apted's "Amazing Grace."<br /><br />Also starring is costume designer Alexandra Byrne.  Her costumes are gorgeous & stunning.  Byrne's 3 Oscar nominations for costume design include Hamlet (96), Elizabeth (98) & "Finding Neverland" (04).  She costumed "Sleuth" with Michael Caine & Jude Law.<br /><br />Elizabeth is a stunning film that sweeps us into the epic, keeps us entranced with a story that does not drag, is performed exquisitely & leaves an appreciation for this era.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

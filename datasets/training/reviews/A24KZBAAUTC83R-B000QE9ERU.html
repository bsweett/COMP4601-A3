<meta name="summary" content="PLEASE DON'T PUNISH ME!!"></head><body><p>The Punisher is a action-packed rendition of the comic book formula.<br /><br />Unlike Spiderman, Batman and Superman, the Punisher is altogether different.  No cape nor super powers, just various kinds of firepower and ass kicking weaponry.<br /><br />Revenge and gritty action is the name of the game here, folks.<br /><br />A new action star has arrived, both in this actor and this franchise.  This was a most enjoyable, fast-paced movie that I enjoyed immensely.  John Travolta did a fair job at playing the devil-may-care baddie.<br /><br />But the supreme action sequences is where its at here in this movie.  Some good storyline as well, don't get me wrong.  But when Castle puts on his signiture shirt - the skeleton head - look out!  Because all hell is gonna break loose.<br /><br />A must see.</p></body></html>

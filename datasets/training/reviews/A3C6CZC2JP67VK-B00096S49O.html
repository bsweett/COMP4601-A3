He was definatly right for the part and had the feel for the character. I liked the way Eva Medes took her character and interacted with Will Smith. Kevin James makes an impressive first outing with movies, he is hilarious in the movie, and actually takes the joke and makes it funnier than it is. somehow, I felt the script was weak, I felt that some moments were forced, and some of the Humor was so fast that you didn't have time to think about the joke. Will Smith at times was a little too confident in his role, I think he felt that he WAS the character, when I think that he could've taken situations and used his humor to make it funnier.<br /><br />The movie wasn't a masterpiece but it is WAY better than some movies that have been released that call themselves "Romantic Comedies". Andy Tennant, Director, did a good job but.... could've gotten better performances by cast. The writers in the other hand needed to write something original, and instead of the clich&eacute;s'. There are definitely some silly scenes, which some aren't quite realistic, but the other are so true to life that it hits you square in the eyes. the things I appreciated the most about Hitch is that it is free of the overt sexual innuendos that are so common and accepted in most romantic comedies... it could almost be rated PG.<br />To sum it up it's a movie about a guy who helps guys get the girl of their dreams to fall in love. "Hitch" is great for (almost) all ages (due to little language) but it is worth having.</p></body></html>

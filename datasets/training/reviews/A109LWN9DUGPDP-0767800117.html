<meta name="summary" content="best civil war film ever made"></head><body><p>let me begin by say this was the most emotional film i have ever seen,i neerly found my eyes turning bloodshot red in the climatic ending&quot;i sad almost red&quot;not only emotional but this film is true based on the first black regiment in the civil war.the wardrobes are authentic lookinking the battles are very realistic and the characters ah! the characters so wonerfuly acted.the film diminstrates how willful the human soul can be,and how man can endure brutality for what he truly belives in as the case for the black regiment in this film.you must see it to belive it and here it to feel it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I'd Take This Candy From A Stranger"></head><body><p>I will admit something up front.  I am a sucker for a tight, clever script where there is plenty of verbal sparring.  Intelligent (might I even say--"thought provoking") drama gets me off.  Two of my favorite classics are "The Lion in Winter" and "Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolff?"--two powerful, but wickedly funny, verbal bloodbaths based on plays.  Now I'm not saying "Hard Candy" falls into that league, but it is certainly refreshing to watch an adult film with an actual point-of-view that doesn't dumb itself down for mass consumption.<br /><br />Ellen Page and Patrick Wilson are both suberb, and there are enough twists and action to keep the viewer guessing through their game of cat-and-mouse.  This is a sweet antidote to the usual summer blockbuster--one that will make you think and one that you will remember.<br /><br />Not to provide a spoiler, but the film does wrap itself up rather tidily--which keeps it from being truly brilliant (I'd actually give it 4 1/2 stars).  But I was riveted throughout.<br /><br />A word of warning, however, I imagine a lot of people might not like this film.  But if you are a fan of well-scripted, well- acted drama and open to the subject matter (might be too controversial or even too graphic for some), I'd definitely give this a try.

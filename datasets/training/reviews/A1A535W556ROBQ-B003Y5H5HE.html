Well, in this case one could make the argument that he sold out to early French cinema, in a loving tale celebrating the work of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013K8J90">Georges Melies</a>.  I say let Scorsese be a "sell out," because this is a wonderful film that recreates a time between the wars in Paris and of imagination rekindled thanks to two plucky kids, Hugo and Isabelle. Chlo? Grace Moretz steals the show as Isabelle.  She's already a heartbreaker at 14.  But, this is ostensibly Hugo's film, so we see it through his eyes, hiding up in the steel trusses of Paris' grand train station, where he tries to reassemble the missing pieces of an automaton left behind by his departed father.<br /><br />The story takes a number of complicated turns with Sacha Baron Cohen providing comic relief as the station inspector, ever vigilante of vagabond kids.  Ben Kingsley plays the noble Georges Melies, reduced to selling mechanical contraptions at a little kiosk.  Scorsese brings Hugo and Georges together through Melies' niece, Isabelle, resulting in a beautiful tribute to early French cinema, ultimately leading to the resurrection of Melies' masterpiece, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006XEH7EO">A Trip to the Moon</a>.  If you are patient, you will be richly rewarded in the end.</p></body></html>

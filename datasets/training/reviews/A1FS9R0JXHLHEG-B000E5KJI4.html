<meta name="summary" content="Very Good - But Not Gladiator."></head><body><p>From the start, I think most of us knew that this was never going to be as great as 2000's epic, Gladiator, for two reasons - one, an epic like this had already been done (taking away its Hollywood originality) and two, its leading star, Brad Pitt, was never going to be good enough to give an Oscar winning performance. Although saying that, he portrayed the posing Achilles well, along with other good cast members such as Brendan Gleeson as Menelaus, Brian Cox playing the powerful Agamemnon and Eric Bana playing the well respected warrior and Prince, Hector.<p>With some tremendous battle scenes, entertaining sword fights and magnificent scenery (filmed in Malta), Troy does not fail to please the viewer. Based on Homer's historic poem 'The Iliad', this film follows many in their pursuits of victory, revenge, love and peace in a time of war. Perhaps not the most gripping or moving of films, you do at least have some care for the characters, yet I strongly believe with perhaps a stronger cast for certain roles, and a better script, Troy could have been one of the all time greats.<p>Yet despite this - Troy is a must see.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Nihilistic, bloody zombie flick wears surprisingly well"></head><body><p>It goes without saying that most good zombie flicks splatter blood by the gallon ("Cronos" being a notable exception).  "28 Weeks Later," sequel to the breakout smash "28 Days Later" follows that rule with gusto, but the movie emerges as a surprisingly thoughtful-yet-action-packed entry into a crowded genre.<br /><br />Helmed by relative newcomer Juan Carlos Fresnadillo - a hot young talent from Spain - "28 Weeks Later" stays true with what worked in the first movie- realistic yet gory violence capped only by virtuoso special effects showing a London decimated by the zombie horde.  The "ragers" unleashed in the first movie are up to their old tricks, running down anyone with a pulse and "converting" them into ragers (or lunch) through bodily fluids and nasty bites.  A terrifying opening sequence sees our "hero," Don (Robert Carlyle of "Full Monty" fame) abandon his wife Alice (Catherine McCormack of "Dangerous Beauty") to be mauled by the ragers.  He barely escapes with his life back to safety - London ruled by the U.S. Army.<br /><br />But the city ain't safe for long.  Alice shows up from beyond the grave, and she's a "carrier" of the rage virus.  Before long (and I don't think I'm giving anything away here, since the ads show the ragers taking over London) there's another outbreak.  An intrepid band of survivors must get to safety.  But where is it?<br /><br />One of the strengths of this movie is that nobody is safe - often a character will get identified as a "safe hero" whom you think will survive all the carnage, only to get offed in spectacular fashion.  The result is a terrifying, edge-of-your-seat movie.  A bare-bones plot - survive - adds to the terror, as does the quip-free dialogue.  This is a strong, intelligent movie, not a clever, hip one that will be dated six weeks after release.  And the movie is mercifully free of gratuitous sex and shower scenes - this is a movie that focuses on the frightening, not the titilation.<br /><br />If you're a fan of horror films, you've probably already seen this movie.  If not, get "28 Days Later" first - you'll need the limited back story to really appreciate this movie.  The DVD extras are also well-worth the investment.<br /><br />Not a Great Movie, by any means, but a darn good one.  Check it out.</p></body></html>

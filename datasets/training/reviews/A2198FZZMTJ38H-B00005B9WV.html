I'm not talking about public hype, or critics reviews or things of that sort; what I'm referring to is the people that tell you that a certain movie is the best movie ever made, and then divulge into the elements of it, drawing you into a conversation about everything that the movie is and what it stands for, and everything that they felt watching the movie, so that after they finally shut up, all you can think about is going to see that movie. <p>This, believe it or not, happened to be the case with &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,&quot; a movie that everyone and his brother kept telling me about. Now, before everyone starts hounding me for not liking this movie, let me clarify to all of you that I did like it. I found it to be a very good movie, one of the better martial arts films ever. Instead of providing a lame story for the purpose of using the martial arts formula, the backbone is one of passion, adventure, all of which has an overall fantasy-like appearance that draws us in and keeps us in its clutches. But I did expect a little more out of it. <p>Set in 19th century China, the movie begins with Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat), a well-known warrior, giving his legendary sword, known as the Green Destiny, to his longtime friend, Sir Te. Just as quickly as it arrives, it is stolen from Sir Te, and Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), who delivered the gift, suspects that the new arrivals residing in Governor Yu's home are responsible. Mu Bai has his own suspicions, which are confirmed when he realizes that the thief is Jade Fox, the powerful female warrior responsible for the death of his master long ago.<p>With her, Fox carries a disciple, Jen (Zhang Ziyi), who possesses great fighting capabilities. The movie ventures into a long continuous memory through her eyes, recalling her past love affair with a bandit named Lo (Chang Chen), who returns to rekindle their love. Meanwhile, as the battle for the sword and justice swells, Shu Lien and Mu Bai also recognize their mutual feelings for one another, all mounting to a very emotionally powerful climax where the unexpected suddenly becomes a reality. <p>The movie certainly does prove a point that American-made martial arts films pale sorely in comparison to the grandeur of the stunts and action sequences performed here. Choreographer Yuen Wo Ping, best known for his work on the stunts in &quot;The Matrix,&quot; brings a highly-stylized visual flare to the stunts performed by the actors themselves in this film. While the action and fight sequences are meant to be stunning, they are never totally suspenseful, however, nor do they need to be. <p>This is not a film that's all about swordplay and running across rooftops, even if most people will remember it for such scenes. It's also about the intense passion between the characters and the love they share for one another. Lo and Jen's encounter and budding romance is better than anything I've ever seen in a movie in a very long time; Lo's one line, &quot;I am a man, and I've found the brightest star of all,&quot; sells us on their romance and it's believability. While the romance between Shu Lien and Mu Bai takes a backseat to the heated passion of the aforementioned couple, it is still no less captivating once the final third of the movie plays out. <p>The setting itself is worth the price of admission. China, or nature for that matter, never looked so beautiful and exquisite. The night skies cast blue hues on everything they touch, adding to that dreamy look and feel that the movie gives off. Scenic shots and panoramic views add to the beauty and texture of the setting, while also giving off that fantastical feeling. <p>The movie also portrays a very dignified Chinese society. Their use of common etiquette, even in some fight scenes, is quite intriguing, while their calmness and sense of peace is also portrayed through the characters. Actors Chow Yun Fat, Michelle Yeoh, Chang Chen and Zhang Ziyi portray their characters with all of these emotions and traits, exuding a peaceful demeanor even in some of the more physically charged scenes. And director Ang Lee made an excellent choice of keeping the movie from ever getting too fast-paced or over-the-top; he knows his pacing, and it's right on the money. <p>So what is it about this movie I didn't like? Nothing, really. Everything about it is epic in nature, the performances are stellar, the martial arts impressive and well-done, the setting lush and breathtaking, and the overall effect tear-jerking at certain moments. What ruined this film experience for me was not the movie itself, but people making it out to be something more than it is, which is no fault of the filmmakers at all. Still, &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot; is an impressive and beautiful achievement.</p></body></html>

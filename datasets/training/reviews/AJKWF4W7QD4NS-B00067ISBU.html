<meta name="summary" content="This is how to do a comic book adaptation"></head><body><p>After crafting an unappreciated classic with Blade 2, director Guillermo del Toro brings Mike Mignola's classic Dark Horse Comics character to life in this stunning and superbly crafted film.  In a last ditch effort to turn the tide of World War II, a Nazi experiment to bring forth a creature of destruction results in the coming of a horned, red skinned creature, aptly called Hellboy (Ron Perlman, perfectly cast), who over the years is raised by Professor Broom (John Hurt) and works for the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense, battling otherworldly creatures alongside his amphibious partner Abe Sapien (played by Doug Jones and voiced by Fraiser's David Hyde Pierce) while nursing a love for the pyrotechnical Liz (Selma Blair).  del Toro and his crew have really crafted something special here, paying wonderful homage to Mignola's source material while del Toro's screenplay adds another layer of development to the characters, taking the relationships between Hellboy, Broom, and Liz to never before imagined heights.  Perlman, mostly known for his role on TV's Beauty & the Beast, is perfect is Hellboy, and I can't imagine anyone else whether it be Nicolas Cage or Vin Diesel (both of whom were rumored to have attachments to the film in early development) to play the hero.  It's not perfect, and not up there with the original Batman, Blade, or X2: X-Men United; but Hellboy is without a doubt one of the most brilliantly conceived visual feasts adapted from a comic book of all time, and fans of Hellboy old and new will find plenty to admire with this film.</p></body></html>

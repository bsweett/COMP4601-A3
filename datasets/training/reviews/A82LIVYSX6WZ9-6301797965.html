<meta name="summary" content="one of Mel Brooks' best"></head><body><p>of course, Mel Brookss young Frankenstien is a classic and is very very funny. Gene Wilder is great and so is Martin Feldman as Igor, but its that damn Gene Hackman cameo as the blindman which is the funniest sceen in the movie. Nicely shot in black and white. I cant imagine though Peter Boyle (the monster) as being really hung, I know its a movie but why Peter Boyle huh. Anyway, its a great Mel Brooks film next to Blazing Saddles and SpaceBalls. Gotta love that Igor</p></body></html>

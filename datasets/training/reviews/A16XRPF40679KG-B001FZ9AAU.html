<meta name="summary" content="blu ray man"></head><body><p>Get this in the blu ray version.  It looks alot better than the other version and this is great movie.  Everyone in it does a fantastic job<br />that makes this a awesome movie that is everything a blockbuster should be: Entertaining, fine acting, a solid story,  brilliant effects ,<br />and it has characters that are well rounded.  And jeff bridges who makes a fine villian in this story.  He was always underestimated as a actor and this movie lets him create a believable slimy villian who might be working in any organization.  The movies have finally caught up to my old 1960's comic books in their ability to depict great fantasy heroes.</p></body></html>

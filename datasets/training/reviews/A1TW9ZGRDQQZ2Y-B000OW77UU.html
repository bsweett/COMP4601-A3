<meta name="summary" content="Will Smith Shines"></head><body><p>I'm not a big Will Smith fan, but he is very good here and deserves his Golden Globe nomination. His real life son, who plays his son in the film, is much better than I thought he would be. I thought the whole movie would be feel good and sappy, but most of it is a real downer. At least it ends on a good note. I'm glad I saw it, but if I wasn't so bored today, I could have waited for it to hit DVD.</p></body></html>

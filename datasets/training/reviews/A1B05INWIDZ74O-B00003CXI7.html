Feeling lonely after her daughter leaves home for college, Claire played by Michelle Pfeiffe, begins to sense that something is wrong in her house, and feels a spirit is trying to contact her. At first her husband  played by Harrison Ford, who is a scientist doing research in genetics, attributes her paranormal beliefs to stress or possibly a nervous breakdown, and sends her to a psychiatrist who puts no more stock in Claire's stories than does her husband. While Claire's contention that someone or something sinister is that seems to lead her down a number of wrong paths, in time she becomes convinced that the mysterious happenings at her home are somehow connected to the disappearance of a woman who was a student at the nearby college.</p></body></html>

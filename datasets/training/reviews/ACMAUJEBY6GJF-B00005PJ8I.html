<meta name="summary" content="It can be experienced as a movie..."></head><body><p>...that wasn't very hard to make. But in its' "simplicity" to me it manages to be as complete as it could have been, and that way being some kind of a simple "masterpiece". Confused? If so I apologize, but the movie I'm trying to write a "worthy" review of here being as moving and as brilliant as it is for being a movie with very limited dialogue and "events". Most of the movie taking place at a distant island far from the civilized world, where Hanks' character spends four years after a plane he's on crashes into the sea.<br /><br />The silence and the loneliness he feels is brilliant described the way he builds up a relationship with a soccer ball that he paints a face with his blood on. What keeps him alive is the hope of seeing the love of his life again, and finally he takes the risk of setting out to the open ocean not wanting to die alone on that island. Four years as mentioned.<br /><br />The movie is no lost-island-adventure-movie, not at all. It's a "modern" drama (though timeless I believe) without pirates and treasures. It seems to focuse on being as realistic as possible, and this way it makes it easy to imagine this mans' desperate situation.<br /><br />Not wanting to give too much away here for those of you who haven't seen the movie, "Cast Away" has perhaps the sadest ending ever in the "movie-history". Ok, I'm a guy, but the ending here made it almost hard to breathe -and I doubt I'm the only guy who've felt that way seeing it.<br /><br />So where some find "Cast Away" disturbingly boring others will find it moving and beautiful. As I did. Because of the fantastic acting (as usual by Tom Hanks, also by Helen Hunt playing his girlfriend), the way we get involved in the lives of the lead characters here -I'd say; Highly recommended!<br /><br />"Cast Away" is a one-of-a-kind-movie, and this way it stays with you for a while.</p></body></html>

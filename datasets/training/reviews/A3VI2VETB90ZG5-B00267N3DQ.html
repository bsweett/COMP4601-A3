<meta name="summary" content="Snow White on Blu-ray - Excellent"></head><body><p>I didn't think animated features would benefit from a high definition transfer, but it turns out they do.<br /><br />This Blu-ray Diamond Edition of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves adds enough resolution to the film to make it seem as though we're leering just over the actual sequence of cels, allowing us to see the quality of the hand drawn images as if we're looking right at them. Small details aren't muttled into an averaged pixel representation - you see all the small details in their original glory.<br /><br />The audio quality is truly superb. Disney must have kept their original audio masters in outstanding condition. The clarity and fidelity of the sound completely masks the age of the film. It sounds like a recent release (unlike another clean, but distant-sounding 70th anniversary product that just released with a watch) - they've done a fantastic job with the multi-track audio.<br /><br />Are the visual and audio improvements astonishing? Let me say it's enough to add a certain charm to the film that had not been apparent in previous home-viewing formats. It's very captivating to watch this presentation in its storybook form, from start to finish, it's just magic. There is no jaw-dropping difference to where you might be majorly missing out on anything, but this is the best presentation available and it is worth its price for this historically significant gem of a film.</p></body></html>

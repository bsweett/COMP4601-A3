<meta name="summary" content="UH NOT EXACTLY SUBTLE, OLIVER"></head><body><p>There was a time, very long ago, that Oliver Stone made relevant movies, granted he always had an ax to grind, but his movies were not provocative, just to be provocative.  W. is a perfect example, it's obvious Stone is no fan of the former president, but he tries I suppose in his own warped way to understand Bush, and im sure he feels he was fair, but really this is just a badly filmed pseudo intellectual mess.  The performances are all over the place, it's like the actors are as confused as the director.  Brolin is passable as Bush, but he really doesnt ever make you forget that you are watching a caracature..the rest of the cast does sort of bad imatations, with the execteption of the singular Cromwell as Poppy, not really sure 41 was like this, but it's a riviting performance none the less..but really there is nothing to recommend here..it's Stone at his most indulgent..granted this mess is not as bad as Alexander..high praise indeed.</p></body></html>

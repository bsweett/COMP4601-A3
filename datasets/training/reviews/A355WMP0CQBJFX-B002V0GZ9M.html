<meta name="summary" content="A FAIRY TALE TO GOOD TO BE TRUE!!"></head><body><p>the lake house is a splendid film. wonderful and truly makes you wish you were in fantasy land. it doesn't hurt to go off in your own world once in a while and that's where this movie takes you. a love story that's hard to believe, but at the same time you can't help but hope. it takes you to fantasy island where wishes come true and true love is forever. when a movie takes you there then you know it was good. i guess it all depends if you're a romantic or not. whatever you like, but i know i did. it's about two people who meet via letters. a long distance relationship, seperated by time, two years to be exact. for some reason or another they found each other, they bonded and seem to know that they're made for each other, but how do they meet. how is this possible. they're love runs deep and their only seperation is time. they try, something happens, she gives up, he doesn't want to let go, but how can they meet. time goes by, she realizes she can't be without him, she made a mistake in turning away, is it to late. can they still be together. during the whole movie you're just rooting for them hoping things will end happily ever after. this movie made me shed a tear. for real, it moved me in a good way. it's that possibility that true love can overcome anything, even time. as for the actors, sandra bullock one of my favorite ladies. excellent actress, so down to earth, and she just has this sensitivity that she just delivers in this movie that you can't help but care for her. just another great movie that she made possible. as for keanu reeves, this man is great. he gives the role that romance that soft side that every woman looks for. he never gives up. very talented and has many movies to prove just that. their chemistry is unbelievable. so much that any movie they do together is bound to be a good one. speed was all action, this is nothing but romance and they have proven that they can do both. magical.</p></body></html>

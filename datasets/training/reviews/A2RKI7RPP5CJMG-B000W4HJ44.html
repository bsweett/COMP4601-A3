I won't go so far as to say that I prefer this version to the original, but it definitely does not stand in the 1988 film's shadow.  Newcomer Nikki Blonsky takes the reins as Tracy Turnblad, the sweetly rebellious chubby girl who takes a stand (or a dance step) against prejudice and racism in 1962 Baltimore.  All Tracy wants to do is become a featured dancer on the Corny Collins show and woo Link Larkin (Zac Efron, of the "High School Musical" films).  In order to do that, she has to audition for the show.  After running into a roadblock called Velma Von Tussel (the devilishly funny Michelle Pfeiffer) and not getting to be on the program, she literally dances her way on to the set when she learns a few dance moves from Seaweed (Elijah Kelley), a young black man she meets in school detention.  As the story rolls along, Tracy sees not only racial discrimination, but discrimination of anybody who's just a little bit different than the "norm" in Baltimore.<br /><br />This story, on the surface, seems very light and happy.  However, it deals with the very real and very serious issue of discrimination on a number of levels.  The race issue is at the forefront, but there are a few other issues at hand.  Tracy's mother (gamely played by John Travolta, although his makeup looks very Muppet-like) struggles with the embarassment of being very overweight.  Tracy's friend, Penny (a very perky Amanda Bynes in a limited role) feels as if she's living in a prison at home.  Link has to make a decision about what's right for everybody and what's right for him career-wise.  Then there's Von Tussel, her daughter (Brittany Snow of "John Tucker Must Die"), and the local TV station unwilling to integrate the Corny Collins show despite the demands of Collins (a slicked-up James Marsden) and Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah, in a surprisingly excellent performance).<br /><br />The music and dance numbers are excellent, with amazing performances by Blonsky, Kelley, Efron and even Christopher Walken (as Tracy's father).  The songs hearken back to the "wall of sound" created by Phil Spector.  They are massive and highly enjoyable to listen to.  John Travolta does an excellent job with his vocals, but instead of hearing a woman, I can't help but hear "Grease" each time he sings in this film.  That's not a bad thing, though, and most folks unfamiliar with Travolta's past musical numbers will probably not even notice it.<br /><br />Director Adam Shankman keeps everything moving at an easily digestable pace and pegs the actors' delivery of one-liners and wicked tunes such as "New Girl In Town."<br /><br />There's a little language, a lot of sexual innuendo, one scene of seduction (although it is hilariously one-sided) and some mean-spirited actions that may not be suitable for some youngsters, but I personally have no problem with my six-year-old watching this movie.  The race issues may be a little bit too heavy for younger viewers to comprehend, but I think that most of them will pick up on the generalized issue that some people hate others who are different whether it be due to skin color, weight, or something else.<br /><br />Keep an eye open for a cameo from Ricki Lake and John Waters.  Also watch for Jerry Stiller (Tracy's father in the original film) as Mr. Pinky.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film to anybody over the age of five.  Youngsters will be drawn to the wonderful music and dance numbers.  Older children and adults will pick up on the sneering humor and the issue of discrimination.</p></body></html>

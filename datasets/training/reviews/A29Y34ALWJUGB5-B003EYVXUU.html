<meta name="summary" content="Finally a Vampire Movie for the Rest of Us"></head><body><p>Alright kiddies, time to grow up. Take your Twilight DVDs and throw them into the garbage where they belong. Time to graduate from grade school and move right in with the upper class. Let Me In is the vampire movie that real vampire movie fans have been wanting for years. (Before I continue I just want to apologize to the fans of Twilight. I mean no offense. I'm only saying, in a humorous way, that Let Me In is in no way Twilight.)<br /><br />Some of you may already know this but Let Me In is a remake of a Swedish film "Let the Right One In." For those of you who may have seen this I'm sure you won't be disappointed with Let Me In. With the exception of a few scenes, Let Me In stays true to the original. The few scenes that were changed were mostly do to cultural difference or confusing segments. Let Me In is neither better nor worse, it's just an Americanized version of a very good movie.<br /><br />For those who didn't know of or see the original, you're in for a treat. I wouldn't call this a horror film, but more of a dramatic thriller. It follows a young boy named Owen, a skinny, shy, socially awkward twelve year old. His young life is in shambles: his parents are divorcing, he doesn't have any friends, and he's being bullied in school. The only thing in his life that makes him happy are Now & Laters. But then Abby moves in next door, a mysterious young girl who finds Owen just as curious as he finds her. They slowly strike up a friendship, and through her Owen starts to take a little bit of control in his life. Yet something doesn't seem right about Abby, and Owen must decide if he wants to let that get in the way of his friendship with the young girl Abby.<br /><br />Let Me In doesn't pull many punches in terms of content. It is brutal and bloody. It has quite a few mature situations. And it carries with every scene a brooding and dark atmosphere. I guess that's to be expected though when it comes to real vampire films.<br /><br />I can highly recommend this movie to any fan of quality horror or thriller films. It's a solid addition to a very small line of movies (that being good, mature vampire films). And, if you're sick of those sparkling-chested, sun-walking, baseball-playing, emo-vampires from "other" movies then you'll love Let Me In.... (Again, Twilight fans, I'm sorry....)</p></body></html>

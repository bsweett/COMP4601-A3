<meta name="summary" content="Yes, Virginia, there are desert turkeys..."></head><body><p>Two guys, one hunky, one his goofy sidekick, find a wrecked plane half-buried in the desert. They're handcuffed to the flatbed of a truck that they unscrewed, shoved out of their captors' vehicle, and now have been hauling up and down dunes all day - without any water, mind you - until they've stumbled upon this wrecked plane. The goofy guy looks at the hunky guy, the goofy guy makes a joke, cue up Steppenwolf's "Magic Carpet Ride", and, well these guys have unlocked the handcuffs and rigged the wrecked plane into a windsurfer.<br /><br />That's "Sahara" - the worst of "MacGuyver" mixed with the worst of "Indiana Jones" in a plot that was handled better in the "Tomb Raider" series. I'm comparing "Tomb Raider" favorably here. You get the idea.<br /><br />Long, ridiculously convoluted story short: Dirk (Matthew McConaughey) and Al (Steve Zahn, getting a career bump from his Texas buddy) are old treasure hunters, and Dirk believes an Civil War freighter sailed across Africa near the end of that war, ran aground in a then-fertile Sahara Desert (it was?) and remains lodged there under sand.<br /><br />Their quest becomes intertwined with the mission of a UN health worker (Penelope Cruz) investigating the mysterious, toxic deaths of hundreds of nomads and rebel fighters. There's a military dictator, a chemical waste plant, a wicked corporate type disguised as a humanitarian, and Dirk and Al's boss, the Admiral, played by William H. Macy, a talented professional who'll act in just about any old rotten thing.<br /><br />Unlike the "Indiana Jones" trilogy, content to fit archaeology into a single plot engine, "Sahara" is based on a Clive Cussler novel, and it's a buffet of perspectives and characters stuffed into two hours for the movie to ever have coherence.<br /><br />Was it necessary that the mysterious deaths warn of a worldwide plague? Was it useful to supply an African Civil War subplot? The two action peaks - a motorboat duel and a brawl atop a solar tower - aren't original, and the jokey-dokey interplay between McConaughey and Zahn clang against the movie's detail overload and the presence of Cruz, a stunning woman still struggling with pronuciation and syllable emphasis in the English language. Cruz inches ever closer to achieving a sense of humor, but she's still dead serious in "Sahara," forgetting even to crack a smile in the movie's obligatory celebration scene.<br /><br />"Sahra" sits on McConaughey's shoulders as producer/star, and possibly the lead scapegoat in a lawsuit Cussler has threatened to file after disowning the picture. Well, Dirk Pitt's no Bond or Jones or even Croft. The appeal of McConaughey eludes me. He has the face of an underfed dog, is consistently tanned to the color of a burnt turkey and seems to given over most of his career to playing the gentleman doof in romantic comedies and gunk like this.<br /><br />It'd be one thing if he had Harrison Ford's sarcasm but he doesn't - he drawls and lumbers about, as capable of an overnight drunk as he is a day in the action movies. He's added a thin moustache for this role; let their not be a sequel, lest young women begin to pester their boyfriends for the sleazy, casino dealer look.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A delight from start to finish"></head><body><p>A human baby, accidentally taken to the North Pole in Santa Claus's (Edward Asner) bag, is raised by elves.  Although Buddy (Will Ferrell) believes he is an elf, he knows that he doesn't fit in-and not only because he is four feet taller than everyone else.  Shocked at the news that he is really a human, he travels to the human world to meet his real father (James Caan), a cynical publisher who is facing a crisis in his professional life.  In a film like this, it goes without saying that everyone will be the better for having met Buddy.<br /><br />This film is a real delight.  Ferrell shows that he has what it takes to carry a film; he should enjoy a long and successful movie career.  Genuinely sweet and happy without becoming cloying and phony, "Elf" is perhaps the best Christmas movie in recent years.  The eclectic cast is one of its greatest assets.  Besides the abovementioned actors, it features Bob Newhart, the beautiful Zooey Deschanel, Mary Steenbergen, Faizon Love, and the Howard Stern Show's Artie Lang in a memorable cameo as a department store Santa./</p></body></html>

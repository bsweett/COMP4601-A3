<meta name="summary" content="Fantastic movie :->"></head><body><p>To be honest, I hadn't seen this movie until the other night.  I'm not a fan of country music and therefore I always thought that this wouldn't interest me, yet it was on TV the other night and I got engrossed in it from start to finish.  It was a moving story and so well acted.<br />Joaquin and Reese had amazing chemistry in every scene, but the best was watching them on stage together.  I thought they did such a good job singing rather than lip syncing.  Joaquin had his vocals down perfectly and you almost couldn't tell that it wasn't in fact Johnny Cash himself singing.  I never knew how difficult his childhood was and the lack of love from his father toward him.<br />You do not have to be a fan of Cash's music to really apreciate this.  Walk The Line is a great movie that I highly recommend.  It's so interesting and you can't help but tap your feet to the music.  It's so well acted and a great love story.  Go see it now if you haven't already.</p></body></html>

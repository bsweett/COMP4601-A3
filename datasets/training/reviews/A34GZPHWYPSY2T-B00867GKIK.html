<meta name="summary" content="What Goes Down..."></head><body><p>All this humble reviewer can add here among the reviews is that I really loved this film. My wife and I nearly cried within the first 11 minutes--when the Karl Fredericksen character's life-in-flashback is shown--but then, we are old codgers.<br /><br />The remainder is a delight and quite realistic...for one of those funny cartoons with geometrically challenged characters. Karl looks like Spencer Tracy in "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" (everyone I asked about this point agreed with me). Right down to his glasses.<br /><br />One criticism I have--and I took away a star for it--was Chrsitopher Plummer's explorer character. He was far too menacing, and I don't think children could really relate to this type of thing. My wife stated that the character seemed far too much for children to handle.<br /><br />This review has been obtuse for a reason: enjoy this film for yourself, without anything further being mentioned by me on the subject. It will take each viewer to a different place, I suspect, and it has some of the funniest moments on film (which I wish had been more and had extended longer).</p></body></html>

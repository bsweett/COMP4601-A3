He's not just up against hordes of  flesh-stripping monsters this time around. Nope, this time he's stumbled into the middle of a galactic takeover. Riddick must somehow face the Necromongers, an army of planet-killing warriors, bent on converting all to their insane religion or simply wiping out those who dare to resist. Riddick appears to be up against an unstoppable force here! Fortunately, he's also got a destiny that even he knows nothing about. Riddick is here for a reason. His very purpose is tied to this overwhelming army of zealots! The Necromongers have messed with the wrong guy! THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK is big, loud, and very entertaining. Highly recommended...</p></body></html>

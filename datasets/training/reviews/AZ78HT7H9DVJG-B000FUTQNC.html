<meta name="summary" content="it's ok if you don't mind a predictable movie..."></head><body><p>*Firewall* is alright.  There's nothing really "edgy" in this movie.  *Firewall* isn't nearly as exciting as Harrison Ford's other movies, such as *Air Force One*.  *Firewall* is predictable yet still enjoyable.<br /><br />Jack Stanfield (Ford) is the head of security of a bank that will merge with another in the upcoming weeks.  However, Jack has some reservations about the merger, which is causing some delays.<br /><br />A group of thugs invades the Stanfield residence and holds the family hostage.  Jack has been told that the family will be released once Jack has successfully tranferred millions of dollars from the bank to offshore accounts.<br /><br />Sounds easy enough, right?  All Jack has to do is follow orders.  Or all Jack has to do is pretend he'll do it but report the crime.  However, every steps he make are monitored via hidden cameras.  If he makes one small mistake, his family is gone.<br /><br />The suspense builds here.  However, once Jack finds a solution, the rest becomes predictable.  The question you gotta ask yourself is "why is this happening?"<br /><br />There's nothing unique about this movie.  No interesting car chase.  No fascinating hand-to-hand combat.  No heart-thumping moments of suspense.  It's just a regular movie about a guy wanting to save his family from hostage.</p></body></html>

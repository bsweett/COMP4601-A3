<meta name="summary" content="Elizabeth--Part 2"></head><body><p>Cate Blanchett does a convincing job of portraying Elizabeth I as she grapples with her enemies, the Catholic government of Spain and her cousin, Mary Queen of Scots.  She dispatches both of them quite neatly, but not before she gets to wear fabulous costumes and flirt with Sir Walter Raleigh who becomes enamored with Bess, her lady-in-waiting.  The movie has some spectacular battle scenes and good acting (mostly by Blancett) and gives the viewer a brushing-up on somewhat-accurate English history.</p></body></html>

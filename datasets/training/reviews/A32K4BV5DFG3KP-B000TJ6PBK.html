<meta name="summary" content="Sometimes death is better."></head><body><p>This film starts off a bit slow, and could have given a bit more of a back story to make the viewer understand about the tragic loss that the main character went through. The main character has become disillusioned with life and no longer thinks that there is any mystery in life. The mind bending qualities of 1408 really creeped me out, in about the same way that "Jacob's Ladder" creeped me out. I think on the undercurrent all people must be horrified of the same thing, the loss of family, your mind, reality itself. There are something's that are worse than death. I think that's what 1408 was about the horror that everyone has in them that people would rather die than face. On my creep meter I give 1408 ten skulls.</p></body></html>

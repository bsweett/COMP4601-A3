<meta name="summary" content="eh film. Johnny Depp saves it."></head><body><p>This was Johnny Depp's first film ever since his nomination for Best Actor for POTC. We open up on a shot of a man sitting in his car and then he goes into a hotel room and sees his wife and goes nuts...the camera cuts away before we see what happens.<br /><br />The same man is visited by another man that says that he has plagerized his story, and that he will kill him if he doesn't credit him for it. He doesn't seem phased by it, and shrugs it off. Then strange things start happening, and He starts going crazy, and He then hires a private investigator and asks him to see what is going on and who is it that is doing to him. But, that messes up and then it sets up the strangest ending ever.<br /><br />Johnny Depp only carries the film to its maximum point. The film itself is wondering what to do next every scene. It has a hard time trying to follow a solid plot, and the ending, just weirds you out. I thought it wasn't one of the greatest of 2004 but it was entertianing and fun to watch Johnny Depp give another good performance.</p></body></html>

In PHONE BOOTH, Stu Shepard does and it changes his life forever. Stu is a semi-successful publicist who has been playing games with people his whole life.  Everyday he goes to the exact same phone booth to make a telephone call to his girlfriend so that his wife won't find out. He's not having an affair, just contemplaing having one.  One day the phone in the booth and there's nobody around to answer it.  Curiousity killed the cat. Stu's no cat, but he is awfully curious and picks it up.  On the other line is killer who has been sniping off lowlifes and scums from the face of the New York City. The sniper tells Stu that he'll shoot him if he doesn't do exactly what he tells him to do and thus begins a game of cat and mouse via the public telephone lines in the phone booth.<br /><br />PHONE BOOTH was a fairly entertaing thriller that's great to eat while eating some popcorn.  Colin Farrell is over-rated as an actor, but PHONE BOOTH is one of the few movies where he's been cast right. Kiefer Sutherland's vocal performance is quite remarkable and sets the tone for the entire movie. Forest Whitaker has a nice supporting role as the police captain in charge of bringing the "dangerous criminal" Stu in alive and without getting anyone else injured or killed. None of the other performances stand out, largely because the characters aren't given much screen time.<br /><br />The plot in PHONE BOOTH is full of holes and inconsistencies, yet it is somehow able to keep one's attention.  The biggest flaw that I found with the film is that the ending was much too tight and overly convenient.  With a run time of less than 85 minutes the filmmakers could have added a little something to fill in some empty spots and make a more satisfying ending. So sit back and relax and if the phone rings, don't pick it up.</p></body></html>

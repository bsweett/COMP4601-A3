<meta name="summary" content="Respectful of original"></head><body><p>One thing that worries me about remakes is that they do not "respect" the original.  This film was able to do just that, yet keep it's own identity. The changes in storyline were subtle and VERY nicely done. The wolfman itself was very similar in style to the Lon Chaney Jr. makeup job...and although the original is considered corney by the standards of today, this new wolfman image is, again, very much like the original, but changed enough to make him ferocious and more to our modern tastes.<br /><br />I can't say that I would have chosen Del Toro as Lawrence if I had the chance to cast, however, after a rocky start he really pulled it off.  Anthony Hopkins was once again, BRILLIANT.  I was almost seeing a little Hannibal L. in his portrayal of Lawrence's father, and it was intruiging, since Claude Raines was such a benign Mr. Talbot.  Anthony loved playing this part...it seems to suit his personality.<br /><br />Visually, this movie was stunning. The scenes of Old London...the moors...just beautifully rendered.  The scenery was a bit unsettling out near the Talbot house and that is exactly what made it all work.  The house didn't have to be decaying, however, it suited the mood and went well alongside the obvious destruction of their family from the inside out.<br /><br />Another great classic monster movie from Universal. I hope any further remakes of their classic monster line of films will be as respectful as this one to the film that came before.</p></body></html>

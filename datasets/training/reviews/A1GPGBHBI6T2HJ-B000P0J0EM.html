<meta name="summary" content="It is NOT what I expected it to be--it was a LOT MORE."></head><body><p>Since I was aware that this movie was from a serial novel written by horror-master Stephen King, I expected it to be a bit more on the scary side than it actually ended up being...however I was NOT disappointed at ALL with the end result.  In fact I found it to be easily one of the best movies I saw in 1999.  <p>The movie starts off today with a gentleman in a retirement home reluctantly reminiscing about events that happened in the 30's at a Prison in the South.  Is this a horror movie?  NO WAY.  In fact it was anything BUT.  Tom Hanks is superb (but then again when ISN'T he?) in the job of being in charge of 'The Green Mile' which represents the floor color that leads to the electric chair from the prison cells.  It's not a mile, in fact it's only about 50-60 feet total...but having to walk that distance to one's ultimate demise would have to be considered a long walk indeed--one that would finish all-too-soon for some characters.<p>Everything from a little mouse--which amazingly has a rather large roll in the movie--but don't worry, it isn't silly at all-- to easily the biggest man I have EVER seen all works together to make 'The Green Mile' an incredible journey which on more than one occasion had me thinking long and hard at the death penalty. My ONLY criticism of the movie was how the supernatural portion was handled...well actually our very large character, John Coffey is accused of killing two young girls (don't worry, he's innocent--but is it enough to win him a stay of execution?) when in reality he was actually trying to HEAL them...you see John has an interesting ability to cure people of their ills.  How?  Well we never really find out, but the ONLY problem I have at ALL with this movie is, well, how he manages to expel the illness once he has removed it from the one who is sick.  Other than that, this film is one that has stayed with me long after I left the theater.  I also was shocked to find out that it was 3-hours long.  As I left the theater I glanced at my watch and could hardly believe that I had been sitting there that long.  It seemed more like the usual hour-and-a-half.  Time just stood still as I watched this fantastic movie.  I enjoyed this movie so much I actually went out and bought the book (which actually IS better, but what book isn't?) and I also found a whole new view of Stephen King.  Do NOT let this movie being written by him keep you from a true masterpiece.  Simply put great filmmaking with each character pulling in a great performance.  Oh, and even though the book was better, I think they did an incredible job of turning it into a movie.</p></body></html>

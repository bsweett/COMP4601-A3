<meta name="summary" content="A Lovely Day at  The Mall"></head><body><p>George Romero has been given credit for inventing zombies. For the record, there were zombie movies before Romero came along. Now moving along. A very original movie, and original concept. I am sure most of you already know it is about a group of people trapped in a mall while a world of zombies wonders around outside, eventually making their way inside the mall. I think the acting is high schoolish, as was the acting in the follow up &quot;Day Of The Dead&quot;. Some of the zombie make up looks  like amateurs dressing up for Halloween. But I do agree this is a classic. I would not agree this is the greatest horror film ever made as been said by many reviewers. I still prefer &quot;Day Of The Dead&quot; over this film. Some people think Romero can do no wrong, and I like some of his work, but I simply do not believe the zombie concept  belongs to him, as so many people seem to think. I also wish everyone would stop comparing every &quot;walking dead&quot; film to Romero's work.</p></body></html>

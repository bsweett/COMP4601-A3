<meta name="summary" content="The Candy Man"></head><body><p>Tim Burton's movie world is almost always concerned with the dreamer and the dream: think Frank Bloom (Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney) in "Big Fish" and Ed Woods (Johnny Depp) in the film of the same name. But his films are also often about the search for a father, either real or emotionally as in "Big Fish" again and "Edward Scissorhands."<br />Burton's version of the Willie Wonka story is about both, the dreamer: Willie and Charlie (Freddie Highmore) and the search for a father:  the very strange acting and looking Willie Wonka of Johnny Depp for his estranged father, Dr. Wonka (Christopher Lee). Roald Dahl's source material as well as this film share the common theme of men aching from the loss of and searching for the most important relationship in a man's life: the bond between a man and his father.<br />Burton's world is also one of perfection and beauty: think the Technicolor gone bananas neighborhood of "Edward Scissorhands." Philippe Roussellot's production here is likewise blindingly gorgeous and eye-poppingly dense with color and artful design.<br />This version of "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" is much closer to that of Dahl's in that it is wittier and likewise naughtily misanthropic than the previous Gene Wilder version. Burton's "CATCF" is sly and malicious, particularly in his treatment of the children that Willie tours around his factory. As in Dahl's story, these children represent a good part of the 7 Deadly sins: Gluttony in the guise of the chubby Augustus Gloop, Greed and Anger in the perfectly page-boyed and unctuous Violet Beauregarde, Pride in the obnoxious Mike Teavee (to whom Willie is perpetually saying "Stop Mumbling, I can't understand you!" when his speech is perfectly understandable) and Anger and Envy in the spoiled brattiness of Veruca Salt. Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket and his family stand alone as the embodiment of goodness, caring and love and they alone benefit from Charlie's visit to the Factory.<br />Burton and Depp have a great time putting these kids and their parents in their "place" and though it is a bit cruel, it is fun for us nonetheless: we participate in the action despite our better judgment. And this is the genius of Burton's version of this material: it's dark, it's wicked but it's also full of whimsy and wonder: it's just a hell of a lot of fun.</p></body></html>

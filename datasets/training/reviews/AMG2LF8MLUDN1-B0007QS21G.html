We are asked to believe that certain weather conditions cause instant havoc on the planet.  Twisters, snow, rain, floods, and yes, let's not forget the instant ice age.<br /><br />In the film, a news crew flying in a helicopter reports on the twisters that are popping up all over town.  Mind you, there flying amidst the twisters instead of wathing them from a safe distance away.  Not even storm chasers would do something so looney.<br /><br />Dennis Qaid gives the finest performance a piece of driftwood can give.  Emotionless and expressionless is what I would call him here.  He's got all the excitement of a hangnail.  Of course he's the smartest man on the planet but the President of the United States doesn't listen to him.<br /><br />This is your usual, my dad never spends time with me, I'm a teenager feeling sorry for myself, I'm so misunderstood, I don't have any friends, oh no my kid's in trouble I've got to rescue him because I can do what no other man in the world can do becasue I'm so brave story, (yawn).<br /><br />Of course at the end we get the "we better take care of the planet or else" speech.  Borrrrring!<br /><br />If it's sleep you want go get some sleep aids.  This thing isn't even good at putting you to sleep because it's just so darn annoying.  Run, do not walk, away from this movie.<br /><br />GOOD GRIEF!!!</p></body></html>

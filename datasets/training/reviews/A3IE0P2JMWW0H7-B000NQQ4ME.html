Brilliant cast, good story; I will watch this again!<br /><br />** NOT for the squeamish ** = a must watch for lovers of gore!<br /><br />Story: "peaceful" forest dwelling villagers have their happy idyllic lives shattered by &lt;EVIL> Aztecs. The hero, Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), is dragged away from wife & child. Hauled onto the top of pyramid, just as he is to get the chop/disembowment &lt;&lt;SURPISE>> the sun eclipses and he has the opportunity to escape. Chased by a horde of angry Aztecs, he eradicates them in grizzly and ingenious fashion.... the story builds the baddies as the meanest nastiest guys in South America, so PLENTY of entertainment value (and cheering) when they get it.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw gets to save wife Seven (Dalia Hern&aacute;ndez), family and jungle culture in just over 2 hrs. ***** 5 STARS<br /><br />Gibson also stated that Apocalypto would help dismiss the notion that "history only began with Europeans" source: wikipedia.</p></body></html>

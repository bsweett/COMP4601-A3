But that doesn't seem to stop him from meeting Elvis, fighting in Vietnam, Investing an apple and founding a multimillion dollar shrip company.  <p>Tom Hanks is brilliant and he plays the part wonderfully.  Although some elements of the book that I would have liked to see were not included it still does not take away from a wonderful proformance.  This movie will have you laughing and crying at the same time.</p></body></html>

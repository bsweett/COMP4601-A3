Samuel Jackson, Tommy Lee Jones, Hugo Weaving, Hayley Atwell, and a few others I recognized in this film notwithstanding, somehow this movie cheapens the above and beyond super heroism of everyday men and women in the armed forces serving in hostile zones of combat.  Maybe it was different in WWI or WWII, but beginning with the Korean war, this country has had trouble welcoming their heroes returning from war - especially from Vietnam and since that time.  These days there are no ticker tape parades and cheering crowds who respect and honor the men and women who have watched their fellow soldiers die on the battle field.  There is widespread unemployment, a nation near bankruptcy, and a misery index as high or higher than when Jimmy Carter was president.  And this film won't make you feel good about being given a 4F rating by the Selective Service System registration office, if you honestly wanted to serve in the military.  So it is hard for me to rally behind a film that suggests our nation's finest require a super-chemistry enhanced hero to inspire them to enthusiastically face the enemy.  Especially if the country you're fighting in hates you being there.  But never mind all that, it's just a movie.  A movie about how drugs can make women fall in love with you, taking drugs and experimenting with drugs can make men who hate you willing to follow you as their leader and fight by your side for whatever mission you personally undertake, and taking drugs and experimenting with drugs will let you live over a hundred years and never physically age a single day.  The message in this film is that a sublevel romance that never finds fruition is enough to give somebody the inspiration to accomplish anything even far above and beyond human ability - no wait, that was the drugs, nevermind.  This movie has very little gore, predominantly has a lot of gun violence (more of what today's America desperately needs), a little bit of language but very tame by today's standard, and no female nudity.  It's a PG-13 film, and for having a 140 million dollar budget, you'd think the writers and producers would require a little bit more out of the director and editor.  Dud, flop, fail, fizzle, flummox, lay an egg, loser, turkey, and weenie.  Not even a good chic flick.  I wouldn't give this away to somebody I hated.  Bonfire fodder.</p></body></html>

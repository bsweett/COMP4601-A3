<meta name="summary" content="The Adventures of Indiana Jones DVD Box Set is truly great!"></head><body><p>The Adventures of Indiana Jones DVD Box Set includes all three films: Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Temple of Doom, and The Last Crusade. You also get a Bonus Disc with over 3 hours of bonus materials such as: A new feature-length documentary of the making of the trilogy From the Lucasfilm Archives, The Stunts of Indiana Jones, The Sound of Indiana Jones, The Music of Indiana Jones, The Light and Magic of Indiana Jones, Original trailers, Weblink to exclusive content including dozens of behind-the-scenes photos, an animatic sequence from Raiders, and a PC game preview. What is best about this collection is that all three films are in their original format, but are restored and digitally remastered frame by frame giving the best possible picture quality that these films have ever been seen in. The picture quality is so good that it makes you feel like you are watching a movie that was made not to long ago no matter what size of TV screen you are watching this collection on. The sound is now presented in 5.1 Dolby Digital, which gives even more new life in to each of these films. I can say that The Adventures of Indiana Jones DVD Box Set is a wonderful edition to any fan, or movie collectors collection. I could not ask for a better Christmas gift.</p></body></html>

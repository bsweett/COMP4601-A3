<meta name="summary" content="whatever you want from a movie, you ain't getting it here"></head><body><p>Despite assured direction, solid acting, and seamless special effects, I would account this movie a failure.<br /><br />It's simply way too bloody to be a children's movie, and too childish to be a good adult's movie.<br /><br />There's really only one good scene, the one with the eyeless guy, but even that, I imagine, would be pretty traumatic for a child to watch.<br /><br />Don't sit down to watch this thinking it's some sort of magical children's movie: you'll be sorry.<br /><br />A guaranteed retort to this review is:  "Who told you it's a kid's movie?  They never said it's a kid's movie!"<br /><br />Fine.  So let's evaluate this as an adult's movie:<br /><br />1.  Pointlessly overviolent.  Really the violence is so graphic that whatever other message the director would like to convey gets lost in the shock.<br />2.  The two plots cohere only superficially.<br />3.  The mythical elements seem random, as if somebody had just read a copy of Joseph Campbell and decided to toss a whole bunch of random ideas into the soup.  What was the point of the eyeless guy and eating the grapes, for example?<br /><br />Lemme guess:  you're thinking, "You're being too literal!  Why can't you enjoy the childish wonder and mystery of it?"<br /><br />But wait.  I thought it wasn't a kid's movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Holiday"></head><body><p>At first glance this film seemed to be your typical chick flick with a distinctly 'Bridget Jones' feel about it. But as soon as the house swap occurred it very quickly picked up and becomes quite an endearing story. It isn't too heavy, has some fun performances and is an easy way to spend an afternoon. Kate Winslet is great as a heartbroken journalist who befriends an old school Hollywood script writer and Diaz is good as the highly stressed new era Hollywood type who falls in love in low key English surrey. This is a fairly heart warming, innocuous afternoons viewing and although not brilliant, it is a good enough film for those lighter moments. Worth a look as long as you don't expect too much.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

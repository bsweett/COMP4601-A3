<meta name="summary" content="FASCINATING ENSEMBLE IN A HILARIOUS WHOLESOME HOLIDAY FILM"></head><body><p>There is very little really not to like about this charming collage of a movie. <p>Brilliant ensemble of actors, and thus by implication great cameos from the ilk of Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson and Emma Thomson; credible romantic vignettes intercut together, and thankfully not too saccharine to be implausible (not everyone ends up in their preferred romance for instance); a fair bit of nudity (a big bold "R Actually"); and above all, some delectable humor -- there are sentimentalistic crests but swiftly followed by a jibe or crack that balances the narrative. <p>The vignettes: <p>-- Colin Firth as a writer with a soft spot for his Portuguese maid while working on a novel in a French town<br />-- Liam Neeson as a widower managing his grief by lending his teenager son a hand with his love life<br />-- Emma Thomson as the cheery wife of Alan Rickman, an executive who is falling prey to the come-ons of an office colleague<br />-- Bill Nighy as a spent-out rock star on the comeback trail with a holiday version of the Trogg's "Love Is All Around"<br />-- Hugh Grant as a wonderfully self-deprecating bachelor prime minister in love with a benign British version of Monica Lewinsky<br />-- Laura Linney as an American expat with a romantic life that suffers due to her obligation for her autistic brother<br />-- Andrew Lincoln as a tortured bloke madly but secretly in love with the trophy wife (Keira Knightley) of his best friend<br />-- Kris Marshall as a would-be superstud trying to get to America (he's "cocksure" his British accent will be a chick magnet)<br />-- Martin Freeman and Joanna Page as two innocents who fall in love while working as stand-ins in a porn movie<br />-- Billy Bob Thornton as a nasty U.S. president who gets his comeuppance<br />-- Rowan Atkinson as a prissy department store clerk<p>What more can you ask for in one sitting? Don't read too much into the "too long to be interesting" reviews, this is a must-watch for anyone with a sensitive bone and an adult pass. It's not your everyday sappy chick-flick but a fascinating tapestry of love and longing in our modern lives.<p>Don't miss it!</p></body></html>

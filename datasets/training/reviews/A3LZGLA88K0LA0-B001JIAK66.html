Sure, it's overbrimming with special effects, but they're so cool and well done, I never tired of them, even a few of which were a little over the top.  Director Stephen Sommers who brought us the delightfully campy MUMMY series gives us a riproaring, action packed adventure story, and even though it's camp and humor is not quite as on target as in the Mummy movies, there is still plenty of tongue in cheek humor to soften the monstrous savagery.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman (who would make a good James Bond) stars as the enigmatic Van Helsing, not your typical Peter Cushing Van Helsing, but a strange man who has a clouded past.  Jackman does well in the role, infusing the requisite macho and spiritual qualities.  David Wenham as Carl is wonderful in his low-key, restrained performance.  Wenham, who also appeared in LORD OF THE RINGS, is a capable supporting actor and was fun to watch.  Kate Beckinsale is certainly beautiful, but I've never been overly impressed with her acting abilities, but she makes a nice heroine.  Richard Roxburgh as Dracula is a little too effeminate at times, but he is certainly a snarly vampire.  Kevin J. O'Connor behind great make-up plays Igor with a humorous flair.  Shuler Hensley as the Frankenstein monster overcomes his overwrought makeup to portray the man-made "monster" who wants to be accepted.<br /><br />Alan Silvestri's score is appropriately melodramatic and the visuals, cinematography and art direction are Oscar worthy, as are the effects.<br /><br />Critics generally hated this movie, Newsweek's David Ansen placed it in his ten most disappointing movies of the year.  I found it highly entertaining and that's what movie making is supposed to be.</p></body></html>

Course, much of it's fame comes from the popularity of the 'Pinhead' character, but it's really impressive for other reasons. (He's cool and all, but not that big of a deal, and really doesn't do much of anything, in this one anyway.)  Though there were still plenty of good horror films being made, much of the originality of the genre had slipped away in the 80's.  'Hellraiser' stands in contrast to this trend, as it refuses to be forced into one of the prominent horror subgenres, and actually attempts to be horrific on a number of different levels.  Beyond this, it has fine, stylish direction from Barker, well above average performances from the cast, an excellent, if occasionally a bit overbearing score, and some great, classic fx work.<br /><br />Basic setup is this:  Recently wed Julia and Larry Cotton move into a house jointly owned with Larry's brother, Frank, with whom they've lost touch.  Turns out Julia has quite a thing for the crazy, lecherous Frank, but, unfortunately for her, he's dead.  (Earlier, we'd been shown that he was killed in the attic of this very house, ripped to shreds by creatures from another dimension, whom he summoned by solving a puzzle box.)  While moving in, Larry cuts himself and bleeds all over the attic, which mysteriously revives Frank, albeit in a less than complete form.  Julia discovers Frank, and, in order to revive her affair with him, begins to seduce and murder men, so that Frank may feed on them, and continue to regenerate.  Naturally, this does not bode well for either Larry or his teenaged daughter Kirsty, and it turns out that the demons who abducted Frank in the first place are rather interested in seeing him come back home, thus complicating things even more.  This is a relatively complicated plot summary for a horror movie, which I think points towards why this is so good.  It just covers a lot of bases: It has gruesome, visceral horror in the form of Frank's spectacular resurrection and skinned appearance; gothic, haunted house horror as we are aware of Frank's existence, in the attic, but Kirsty and Larry aren't; emotional, human horror as we are forced to relate to the initially reluctant Julia, who commits horrible, repulsive crimes in the hopes gaining a greater desire; monstrous horror, found in the late arrival of the sadistic cenobites; familial horror, (MAJOR SPOILER ALERT) as Kirsty is forced to do battle with the fully resurrected Frank, who now appears to be her father, Larry, having stolen his skin in order to be completely restored.  Really, I can't think of another horror film that works in so many different ways.  Upon an initial viewing, this film is really likely to keep you on your toes, as it heads in a number of different directions.  I don't really find this movie scary, but I'm so rarely really scare by horror movies anymore that I can't really call this a fault.  What I look for in horror are interesting situations and ideas, things which turn the real world upside down, and few films have made as powerful and nasty an alternate reality as `Hellraiser' has.<br /><br />The acting is strong, if not always remarkable.  Higgins is good as the conniving, icy Julia, with her elaborate, terrifying 80's hair.  Robinson is also good as Larry, managing to not make his character particularly likable, but also not making him unlikable enough that we feel he deserves to be victimized by Frank and Julia.  He needs to be right in the middle, and he is. (SPOILERS: Also, he does a nice job in his later role as Frank, even if it is perhaps slightly over the top)  Laurence is perhaps a bit bland as Kirsty, but she's good enough, and quite good looking, I might add, in spite of her 80's hair.  (Wait, check that.  She was only like 16 at the time, so, legally, I am not allowed to find her attractive.  So never mind.)<br /><br />The gore fx and makeup in this movie are quite cool.  The skinned Frank isn't precisely terrifying, but he works, which is pretty impressive as the whole walking Gray's Anatomy figure is kinda silly in concept.  Also, his initial regeneration scene is awesome, one of my very favorite pieces of traditional FX work ever.  The Cenobite makeup is quite nice too again, when it also could've turned out quite lame.  (Well, fatty ain't so great, but the rest are cool.  And fatty actually looks quite impressive, his design just isn't very good.)  The two monsters they have aren't so great, but they're kinda fun in a cheesy  way, and they don't have too much screen time.<br /><br />Well, I guess I've rambled on enough.  Definitely one of the best, and most distinctive horror films of the 80's.<br /><br />Grade: A-</p></body></html>

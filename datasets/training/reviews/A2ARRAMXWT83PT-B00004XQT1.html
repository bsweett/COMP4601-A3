The whole thing was just bizarre. It was totally and utterly violent and disturbing. On the other hand, certain scenes were hilarious. Christian Bale gives a great portrayal of Patrick Bateman, a self absorbed nut who ticks off about the littlest things. He targets women when he gets really angry about things, and sometimes takes his anger on certain gentleman in his office. When things don't go his way or situations get too stressful for him, something inside him sparks, and he has to kill. Meanwhile, his relationship with his ditzy girlfriend is on the rocks, and her airhead friends constantly surround him. Life sucks for this doofus.<p>The other performances were equally effective. Reese Witherspoon plays Patrick's girlfriend, and she is perfect for the role. The musical score has hints of Bernard Herrmann's &quot;Psycho&quot; score, which fits in this film perfectly.<p>However, this film is very graphic and unnerving, and I don't know if I would recommend it or not; also, the ending was... well...never mind. <p>This one is definitely not for kids.</p></body></html>

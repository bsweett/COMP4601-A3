<meta name="summary" content="Stutter Island"></head><body><p>SHUTTER ISLAND, the Martin Scorsese film starring Leonardo DiCaprio, is one picture I really wanted to like but didn't. I just couldn't.  SHUTTER ISLAND is slow, pretentious, stilted, and clich&eacute;. The ending is worthy of M. Night Shamylan on a very bad day (which is saying a lot considering his many failures.) But maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me start at the beginning.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio plays a US Marshall who is headed to SHUTTER ISLAND to find out what happened to an escaped mental patient. There he meets Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow who are the scientists in charge of the place. After several CGI flashbacks, we learn that DiCaprio's character was a witness to the infamous "Dachau Massacre." You'll realize, after the movie is over, that this has no bearing whatsoever on the movie, despite a good amount of time being spent on it. (The film's account of the incident also seems to be at odds with the contemporary history.) We also learn, through flashback and clumsy exposition, that he is on SHUTTER ISLAND for a very personal reason - to find the man that killed his wife, whom he still sees in visions. So we have maximum security mental hospital on a secluded island with only one way off. Did I mention they are in the middle of a hurricane? And all their electricity goes out? And the crazies escape? And there's a horde of rats? And... And none of that even matters to the movie, but it's all in there. There are secret messages, warnings, crazies who seem sane, the obligatory shock therapy and frontal lobotomies, and an ending that for the life of me I believe was tacked on at the last minute just because. It's as though they took elements from several movies and soldered them together. It just doesn't work.<br /><br />All-in-all, I cannot recommend SHUTTER ISLAND.  There are many better movies for each of the genres that this film tries to represent. Here's a sample:<br /><br />-  Mental Health: One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest<br />-  1950's Crime Drama: L.A. Confidential<br />-  Stuck on an Island: And Then There Were None<br />-  I See Dead People: Sixth Sense<br />-  Escaping from a Prison on an Island: Escape From Alcatraz<br /><br />For a much more entertaining evening, watch one of these instead.</p></body></html>

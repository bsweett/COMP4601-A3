<meta name="summary" content="Watchable, Even Fun, But Can't Be Taken Seriously"></head><body><p>This incarnation of Jules Verne's novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0980921031">A Journey to the Center of the Earth (AD Classic)</a> was really not much more than an excuse to make a cute 3D movie with the always popular Brendan Fraser as a Geologist in search of his missing brother. It also stars Anita Briem as a Mountain Guide/Love Interest and Josh Hutcherson as Fraser's nephew.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me, but even with a healthy suspension of disbelief, this movie has so many holes and overly cute elements that it falls firmly into the same category as Looney Toon Cartoons for me. Except for one tear jerker scene (relatively short and needed to close a plot line), it is mostly comic mayhem and some bits of genuine excitement. It flows like a video game, moving from scene to scene at a hectic pace that most kids will enjoy.<br /><br />About the 3D: The DVD we received had the 2D version on one side and the 3D version on the other. It also came with four 3D glasses. The 3D shown in the theaters uses a completely different technology to produce the 3D effect than the type that is possible on home TVs. This resulted in a hugely disappointing experience for my family, as the 3D effect bothered all of our eyes. We toughed out the bad 3D for about 1/3rd of the movie before flipping it over and finishing with the 2D version.<br /><br />All in all, it is a fairly fun movie but it is completely disposable.</p></body></html>

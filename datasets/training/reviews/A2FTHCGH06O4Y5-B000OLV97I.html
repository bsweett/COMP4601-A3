<meta name="summary" content="How original!"></head><body><p>What I liked about this story was how dazzlingly original the characters and plot elements were.  A young farmboy who finds a secret weapon and becomes the savior of the land?  A bearded wizard who guides him to maturity?  A spunky princess in need of rescuing?  A besieged group of good guys who triumph unexpectedly when all seems lost?  The henchman's evil right-hand man who is killed, beyond all hope, at the very last moment?<br /><br />Truly groundbreaking.</p></body></html>

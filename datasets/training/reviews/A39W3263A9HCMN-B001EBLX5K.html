It was the last day of holidays before the school season, and we needed to see a movie. We chose BORAT, and it was awesome!<br /><br />STORY: Borat, a Kazakh reporter, goes to America to make a documentary about America. He spends the first night in New York. But when he sees Pamela Anderson on an episode of BAYWATCH, He decides to drop everything and go to California to marry her.<br /><br />THOUGHTS: HILARIOUS! My dad and I both laughed from start to end. Not for the young ones, though! It contains Full Frontal nudity... and why is there only a 3.5 star rating?<br /><br />So go see this movie!</p></body></html>

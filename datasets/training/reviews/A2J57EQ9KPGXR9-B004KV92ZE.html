<meta name="summary" content="Cute Movie With A Nice Message"></head><body><p>When I first hears about "Kung-Fu Panda", I groaned - Not another cute little animated movie with inside jokes for adults..<br /><br />But I was presently surprised, this movie presents familiar material in a fresh, fun manner. The animation is top notch as well. Kids can watch this and not get bored and adults will enjoy it as well.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of Jack Nicholson's Greatest Performances"></head><body><p>This is essentially a good movie that is graced by an absolutely stellar performance by one of America's great film actors.  Jack Nicholson has had several performances as memorable as this one, but he has never had one that was appreciably better.  As the child of an intensely obsessive-compulsive father, his performance especially hit home with me (as I was watching this movie with my daughter, I asked her, "Does Jack Nicholson remind you of anyone?" and she immediately shouted, "Grandpa!--out of the mouth of babes).  <p>The brilliant thing about this movie is that it doesn't just stop with a character with a serious social-psychological problem, but deals with his attempts to break out of his mental prison to engage in normal relationships.  Partly this is done through his unexpected relationship with a neighbor's small dog.  Partly this is achieved by what is initially a selfish concern with the difficulties of a waitress with a son with serious health problems (selfish because her absence from the restaurant to deal with her son's health problems upsets his dining routine; he would rather pay out money to help her son than have her miss taking his order for his meal).  Gradually, however, he develops a concern for the waitress (Helen Hunt) not merely as the woman who takes his orders, but as a human being.  Eventually, in his own highly limited way, he sorta, kinda falls in love, to a degree that he is able to utter one of the most romantic lines I have heard in a film:  "You make me wish I was a better man."  He isn't a better man; he isn't even an especially desirable match.  But she is able to accept his affection, with all his limitations as a person.  It isn't the Disney version, but it is all rather lovely.<p>The cast is by and large excellent.  Both Nicholson and Helen Hunt won Oscars for their performances.  I didn't care for Cuba Gooding Jr.'s rather campy gay character, though I suspect the problem was more in the way his part was written than in his performance.  I thought Greg Kinnear was OK as a gay artist and neighbor to Nicholson (in addition to being the owner of the dog), but like Gooding, I could never really accept him as being gay.  But the picture is carried by two superb performances by Nicholson and Hunt.</p></body></html>

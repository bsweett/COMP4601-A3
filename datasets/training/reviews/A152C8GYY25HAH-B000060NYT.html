If it's director and writer, Victor Salva, had been able to sustain the mood he created in the movie's first third, it might have been a great one. Shortly before production began, he was informed that the picture's budget had been slashed. The result was the cutting of the shooting schedule from forty-five days to thirty-one and a lot less money for the art department, which is the one that creates special effects. In light of these constrains, he probably did the best he could.<p>Trish and Darry [Gina Phillips and Justin Long] are returning home from college. Trish, who was recently dumped by her boyfriend, wants to take the long way home, a decision that takes the pair down a lonely country road. In the middle of nowhere, an ominous, rusty old truck roars up behind them and nearly causes them to crash. It finally passes them, but a few miles later, they spot it parked by an abandoned church. They see its occupant tossing something large wrapped in a blanket down a big drainpipe. In a decision which could only happen in this kind of movie, they go back to investigate. What they find there is scary enough, but what put it there is much more so. And it knows who they are.<p>Horror movies come in several forms and often spill over into other genres, such as the psychological thriller. Jeepers Creepers is in the old-fashioned monster movie category, with shades of the occult. It's a cut above most recent efforts of this type. The music is quite atmospheric, and the photography and lighting are very professional. Salva knows how to set a scene up to maximize the effect on the audience. <p>Salva is a good film maker who needs to polish his scripts a little more. He does a really excellent job of making his main characters more interesting and believable than those we usually encounter in such fare, but this makes the dumb things they do seem particularly unlikely. Still, I liked Trish and Darry more than most horror movie main characters. After Darry sees what lies at the bottom of of that drain pipe, he goes into shock. I think this is a much more likely reaction than the emotionally dead, macho reaction you usually see. <p>Justin Long and Gina Phillips are quite good. Many actors seem to get their starts in horror movies. Jack Nicholson comes to mind. You can often spot the good ones, because they consistently give a fine performance whether the material demands it or not.<p>Some people don't like horror movies. For those who enjoy them, this is a good choice, especially considering how thin the selection has been recently.</p></body></html>

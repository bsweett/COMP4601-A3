They rescue him and bring him aboard only to find that he is alive but unconscious.  He has been shot twice in the back and one of the ship's crew removes the bullets from his back.  He also finds along scar on the man's back and he removes a tubular implant from him. It is a laser projector that when activated shows a Swiss bank account number and bank name onto the wall of the ship.<br /><br />When the man suddenly awakes he does not know where he is or how he arrived there.  He has amnesia.  The man helps on the fishing boat crew while they are at sea.  He is always talking to himself in foreign languages and asking who he is.  He tries to remember who he is but he is without an identity.  When the boat arrives at the port the captain gives him a small amount of money to get to the bank in Switzerland.  He takes the train but he does not have enough for a room so he sleeps on the street on a park bench.  Two policemen roust him up and the man suddenly begins speaking fluent Swiss.  He then quickly knocks out and disarms the two policemen in seconds.  He is a master of martial arts and he did not even know that he could do that.<br /><br />He goes to the Bank and opens a safe deposit box that is full of passports, money in many currencies and a gun.  He assumes the name of Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) which is from one of the passports....<br /><br />This is a high action thriller involving an undercover operative in a secret department of the CIA.  He failed his mission and now they want him dead, immediately.  The film is a fast moving spy thriller and Matt Damon does a great job in playing the role he is in.  It provides a view into the operations of the CIA and perhaps a real insight into the world of undercover agents.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film and it is a first class suspense thriller.  I recommend it to you!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Don't read the book before seeing the movie"></head><body><p>The old expression that the book is always better than the movie is oh! so true!  The less you know about T. E. Lawrence, the more enjoyable this movie is.  Unfortunately, I have recently been reading both about Lawrence (both biographies about him as well as his own masterpiece, SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM).  There is always controversy regarding the extent to which the accuracy of the presentation of a historical figure should impact one's assessment of a work of art.  Unfortunately, I did find myself enjoying this film vastly less on a reviewing of it after actually knowing something about the subject matter.<p>Even after having looked somewhat into Lawrence's life, there are many things to laud in the movie.  It is unquestionably one of the most beautiful films ever made, with inconceivably gorgeous cinematography, one of the great musical scores in movie history, and one magnificently epic vista after another.  In no movie is the desert as beautiful and as alluring as in this one (just as Lawrence's own SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM is the great paean to the desert, excepting only Charles Doughty's great classic TRAVELS IN DESERTA ARABIA, which Lawrence took as his literary model).  And while there are some unfortunate casting decisions (at this point in history, one is always disappointed to see non-Arabs playing major Arab roles), Peter O'Toole dominates the screen in every shot in which he appears, with the most piercing blue eyes one can remember.  He is perhaps a tad too good-looking.  One is reminded of Noel Coward's quip to O'Toole, "If you'd been any prettier, it would have been Florence of Arabia."<p>But if you have read about Lawrence or read Lawrence's own book, certain things will disappoint on a reviewing.  First, one is disappointed by the presentation of Lawrence himself.  Although Peter O'Toole is unbelievably charismatic as Lawrence, he is on physical grounds terribly unqualified for the role.  One of the central factors in Lawrence's life was his height:  he was so short he had enormous difficulty getting into the military, only managing it after several high level friends pulled strings for him.  Great care was taken to disguise Lawrence's height, but the guess is that he was between 5'3 and 5'6, and probably towards the shorter figure.  O'Toole is a long, lean 6'3.  Despite some rough physical resemblance, O'Toole's height seriously hurts his ability to portray Lawrence accurately.  <p>I was also somewhat disappointed, upon reviewing, that the gigantic complexity of Lawrence's personality was not better reflected onscreen.  This is probably inevitable.  Lawrence was easily one of the most complex personalities of the 20th century.  Even after having read a pair of biographies, I feel that I know next to nothing about him.  His feelings about the Arabs, his attitudes towards the conflict he was involved in, his goals for himself in the Arab peninsula after the conflict, his masochistic asexuality (he deplored being physically touched by any human being, male or female, yet took delight in his ability to absorb enormous physical brutality, sometimes asking people to beat him with their fists in later life), and, perhaps most of all, his strange relationship to his own fame.  After the Arab conflict, he retreated first into the RAF and then into the Army as anonymous private under a fictitious name (in the army becoming Private T. E. Shaw, the "Shaw" homage to his friend Charlotte Shaw, wife of George Bernard).  <p>The movie also contains many historical inaccuracies, but this is more forgivable in that Lawrence's own book contains perhaps even more inaccuracies.  Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that it contains many embellishments and exaggerations.<p>Still, this is a great movie.  If you don't know much about Lawrence, see the movie before learning more about him.  You'll love the movie a great deal more if you do.</p></body></html>

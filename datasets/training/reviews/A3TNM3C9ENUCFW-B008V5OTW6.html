<meta name="summary" content="Bana shines in Spielberg chronology of violence"></head><body><p>Steven Spielberg is no stranger to delicate political topics, and herein makes no exception with a fairly graphic, factually based chronology of the Black September aftermath at the 1972 Munich Olympics of the title, the five men chosen to eliminate the ones responsible, and the fallout and retribution on both sides, engendered thereafter.<br /><br />Eric Bana plays Avner, an expectant father and low key Mossad enlisted soldier, but son of a hero, who is as horrified and outraged at the events of Munich as the rest of his family and countrymen. He is called to undertake a special "task" outlined by prime minister Golda Meir and her cabinet, in the wake of the killings to "let the World know" the consequence of the Palestinians actions, by setting off to Europe with a list of assassination targets. I won't go into too much further detail, as I don't wish to spoil the movie. I actually have vague memories of the Israeli Hostage debacle at Munich myself, and went on to study the (then termed) Arab/Israeli Conflict in more detail several years later. As an impartial, it is perhaps easier to see through the passionate elements of the story, and draw conclusions on a wider, human level, and it is here that the power of the story lies. Regardless of your political, or religious affiliations, the story is much deeper than the apparent two sides on display, and yet becomes paradoxically more basic in its message (at least in my humble opinion as to the message Spielberg seems to be trying to get across). This is not about "highly trained" assassins paying dues, but rather, well intended, deeply motivated and passionate men following orders for what they think is right, and juggling with their own morality later. The question it seems is an age old one, "does the end justifying the means" and as the story deepens and unfolds, the main characters all begin to battle with moral demons, and paranoid soul searching. There is a wealth of talent on display here, Geoffrey Rush, Ciaran Hinds (HBO Rome's Caesar), Daniel Craig (the new 007 by the way) and Mathieu Kassovitz (Jakob the Liar) and several others, who glean the benefits of a tight script and masterful direction by Spielberg throughout. There are some terrific moments of high tension, some very graphic violence, and also unfortunately, some stale plodding periods along the way. I marveled at the attention to detail in re creating 1973, from the models of European cars, and clothing, to even correct movie posters outside theatres, appearing in no more than a walk across scene. On the down side, this movie is a tad on the long side at 2hrs and 44 mins, and could have arguably been shaved by about 20 minutes. Others have suggested that more could have been done with the material, although I thought it was well handled (with the exception of juxtaposing a sex scene with hostage murders). It is certainly well deserving of the `R' rating, and doesn't (in the usual Spielberg fashion) shy away from the grittiest of details, especially in the bombing and murder scenes. On the whole I rated it 4 Stars, which is probably a little generous, but the polished feel to the whole picture, and excellent acting all round is well worthy of merit. An Oscar contender? I doubt it, and it's hardly Stevens's best work to date, but it IS well worth seeing. Enjoy</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great film, DISAPPOINTING DVD PACKAGE"></head><body><p>As a fan of Russell's for over 7 years now I was looking forward to this film.<br /><br />I was not disappointed.  A great job done by him & Ron Howard.<br /><br />As a film fan that is a true DVD fan I wish I could afford the collectors edition DVD set for this film.<br /><br />So, YOU CANNOT BELIEVE HOW DISAPPOINTED I WAS WHEN I OPENED UP THIS DVD WAITING TO FIND THE NORMAL SHEET WITH THE CHAPTER STOPS FOR THE FILM, OTHER INFORMATION ON THE FILM, AND THE BONUS FEATURES OF THE DVD.<br /><br />AND, WHAT DID I FIND INSTEAD?  AN OPEN UP ADVERTISEMENT FOR KODAK!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />I am very unhappy with this.  If I were interested in Kodak products or finding out more information about them I would go to the appropriate place NOT in a DVD.<br /><br />The people who designed this DVD package & made this decision to input this into the DVD package INSTEAD OF INFORMATION ON THE FILM & THE DVD ITSELF, should be ashamed of themselves.</p></body></html>

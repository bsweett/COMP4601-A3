<meta name="summary" content="The Sweet Taste of Revenge"></head><body><p>This engaging, clever thriller is in fact a morality tale that shows the importance of tolerance, patience and respect in today`s society. Although this may sound preachy, the movie is actually quite compelling and consistent, showcasing the darker side of an average person. Ben Affleck and Samuel Jackson give convincing performances as the two antagonists who have a car accident in a morning. Problem is, that little accident will lead to a twisted, troubled day where a revenge process builds a road to insanity and despair. Director Roger Michell knows how to build tension and suspense, delivering a tight social thriller after his previous and unengaging work in "Notting Hill". Sometimes the mood and atmosphere comes close to that of a David Fincher movie, discussing urban paranoia and the anger it generates. Unfortunately, the predictable ending steals some of the impact of the picture, approaching a typical Hollywood resolution. Still, "Changing Lanes" is a very well-crafted movie and one of the more intriguing surprises of 2002.</p></body></html>

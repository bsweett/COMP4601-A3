"<br /><br />When we talk about dysfunctional families, I think of the really wacky or the every day family that lives next door to us. Rarely do I think of the funny as hell, loving family that does live next door. In fact I think it is rare to meet someone from a 'normal' family- just what is that, anyway?  Enter the family, the Hoovers. The family from New Mexico who welcomes Frank (Steve Carrell) home from the hospital where he was recovering from suicide. Dwayne, (Paul Dano) the elder son writes on a pad "Welcome to Hell:. He has taken a vow of silence and does not speak. Mom (Toni Collete) is trying to keep their family together and dad (Greg Kinnear) is a Tony Robbins wanna be.  The sixth member of the family Alan Arkin, is granpa, a drug user asked to leave the local senior citizen housing group. And the young woman who brings them all together, Olive, Abigail Breslin.<br /><br />Olive has won the chance to enter a beauty/talent contest ',Little Miss Sunshine' and the family decides that everyone will travel to California in their family VW Minibus. Once in the car, this American family road comedy keeps us laughing. This group of actors has become a family that we care about, and they keep us laughing; starting with bus breakdown to a death and on to the beauty pageant which is one of the funniest laugh out loud scenes I have seen. I wanted to join this family of losers/winners.<br /><br />"Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris' directorial debut was a huge hit at Sundance, and it's easy to see why. Though the script is full of predictable character and car artifices, it's never weighed down by them. Instead, the story feels genuine, anchored by heartfelt performances from Sunshine's incredibly talented cast. The movie grows with their characters, the drama building and boiling as one disaster after the next affects each individual. With each life setback the family encounters, they stop flailing to fix their own lives and instead draw closer together, focusing more on Olive and her innocent little dream as it becomes clearer to each that her hopes of success begin to reflect their own need for something special in their lives" Josh Tyler<br /><br />Such an enjoyable film that I have recommended it to all of my friends. Abigail Breslin, Olive, somehow keeps this family all together and they revolve around her. We watch as the family grows and we approve.<br />Highly Recommended., prisrob 1/23/07<br /><br />.</p></body></html>

Shamefully, our country (as well as Europe) views the problems of Africa and most of Asia (beyond the Middle East) as not worth much to sacrifice our lives. Because we ignored the problem and allowed the massacre of nearly a million lives, it is important to have books and movies speak out about this crisis. For that reason, I am grateful that this film was made.<br /><br />Though the similarities to "Schindler's List" are apparent (like Oskar Schindler, who saved 1200 Jews from the Holocaust, Paul Rusesibagina, a Manager of the Hotel Milles Collines in Kigali, Rwanda, managed to save 1200 Rwandans--the Tutsi minority--from being slaughtered). Paul used whatever cunning and lies he could to save his people at every little setback...which included bribery, booze, desperate calls to the Hotel chain's European financial backers, and outright lies to the Hutu General about his being on the U.S. hitlist for war crimes. This film shows that in desperate situations, situational ethics applies, as a strict moralist would likely end up dead. Using personal relationship with thugs to save lives is a lot better than any sanctimonial denouncement of the thug's behavior.<br /><br />Don Cheadle is amazing in this film, as he nails the accent perfectly. The scene where he breaks down and cries after having seen the devastation of the massacre with his own eyes is heartbreaking to watch. If not for Jamie Foxx's phenomenal performance as Ray Charles, I think Don Cheadle would have deserved the Best Actor Oscar this year.<br /><br />The song "Million Voices" by Wyclef Jean is a hauntingly beautiful tribute to Rwanda, as it encorporates a children's choir and relevant lyrics about the human disaster that remains part of Rwanda's historical legacy. After the Holocaust, many people vowed, "Never Again!" would they allow such genocide to take place...yet as we have seen from history, it happened in the Soviet Gulags, on the killing fields of Cambodia, in Bosnia-Hercegovina, in Rwanda, and now in Sudan. Films like these are important to bring about awareness, but in the end, its really a calling to us, daring us to take action in whatever way we can.<br /><br />The DVD features a short documentary on the real Paul Rusesibagina's return to Rwanda, as we see the horrible preservation of some bodies (at first, I didn't realize I was looking at human remains...they looked like white plaster statues of stick figures). In a way, such a preservation will probably force people to remember, as the human tendency seems to be towards, "it never happened." We must remember what evil is capable of achieving...and that it was possible to slaughter half a million people by machetes alone. See this film and may it fill you with a hope to act out whenever injustice rears its ugly head, in whatever form it takes.</p></body></html>

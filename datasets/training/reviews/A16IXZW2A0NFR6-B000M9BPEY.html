<meta name="summary" content="A Heartfelt Treat From Tim Burton"></head><body><p>Director Tim Burton has never really made a film quite this sentimental before and after seeing Big Fish he was long overdue. This film is a very touching and enchanting tale about a father and son trying to mend their paths. Ewan Mcgregor is very impressive in this movie, he just seems to shine with optimistic purity. Albert Finney as the same character in the dusk of his years is equally affecting. The only weak link is Billy Crudup who is very wooden and dry, but the film works nonetheless. There is a magic in Burton's best works, and Big Fish is definatly one of these. Even if your not a regular Burton fan check it out, it may surprise you. If you are a Burton fan and haven't seen it then what's your excuse?</p></body></html>

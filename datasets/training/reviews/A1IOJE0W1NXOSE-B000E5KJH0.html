<meta name="summary" content="Grandma is Mrs. Robinson"></head><body><p>Jennifer Aniston plays a girl who is engaged to be married, but is confused about whether the marriage is the right thing for her or not.  She goes home for her sister's wedding and discovers that her family is the real-life version of the Robinsons from the classic movie "The Graduate".  Though this seems highly unlikely, it serves as a rather interesting premise for the movie.  Since her mother died when she was nine, Anniston has searched for her own identity and she has wondered if her parents were truly happy in her marriage.  She looks for the answer to this enigma, and in dong so, she is able to make her own decision about her future.  This is a charming film with a delightful cast (particularly Shirley MacLaine as Aniston's grandmother) and is definitely a cut above most romantic comedies.</p></body></html>

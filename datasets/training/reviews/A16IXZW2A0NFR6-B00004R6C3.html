<meta name="summary" content="Paranoia, Snow, and an Alien on the Loose"></head><body><p>This is a true masterpiece in movie history. Overlooked and trashed by critics upon it's release, this movie's fanbase has grow immensely as well as the respect this film now receives. The critics didn't like Blade Runner or The Empire Strikes Back either so who cares what these self righteous jerks think, history nearly always proves them wrong. This film creates an overwhelming feeling of distrust and paranoia better than any film before it or since. The special effects are impressive considering the scale and the decade in which they were done. Some have written this off as a gore film, which it certainly is not. The elements of gore in this film actually augment the level of terror and fear. This movie builds it's anxiety level to record heights by the final act. Great acting, great direction, great script, great effects. This film is a good case study in the reason to do remakes, in the right hands they can be done very well indeed, in fact at times...better.</p></body></html>

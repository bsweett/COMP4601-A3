<meta name="summary" content="Mildly entertaining"></head><body><p>Hellboy could have been one of the classic comic book adaptations, but sadly the film-makers lost their bottle and went for an all out CGI monster showdown.<br /><br />The opening is pretty good. During WW2 a portal is opened by the Nazis and Hellboy escapes through it to be found and raised by the allies. 60 years later the time has come for Hellboy to serve the other side for the purpose for which he was designed. Quite what that purpose was I never really understood as the plot was somewhat confusing (not that it really mattered).<br /><br />Sadly although some of the CGI is very good, and there are a number of memorable sequences, there is just too much of it. Once you seen one CGI tentacled monster, another one just becomes a bit of a yawn. Its not without merit though. Ron perlman is a fine actor and delivers his lines with some style and when neccessary with a fine sense of comic timimg.<br /><br />Its certainly worth watching once, but I would be wary of buying it, as I don't think it will hold up to repeated viewings.</p></body></html>

While quite a good film the premise has its limitations and flaws; the character played by Michelle Monaghan isn't really well developed because we get to see so little of her in those eight minutes that are repeated like an endless loop. Still, the screenplay (and director Jones) do the best they can within the confines of the premise.<br /><br />The Blu-ray has a sharp, superb looking transfer. Audio sounds terrific throughout with nice action spread throughout the surround channels.<br /><br />Some people have complained about the ending--I liked it and found it refreshing after seeing too many films with somewhat downbeat endings although I did find it a bit disturbing--(SPOILERS BELOW):<br /><br />Our hero "chooses" to take over the life of the person he was temporarily "inhabiting". Was the result a combination of his memories/personality (much like in "Quantum Leap" and, interestingly, Scott Bakula plays our hero's dad on the phone)or did he obliterate the teacher he inhabited? There are some intersting questions left open at the conclusion of the film which has some disturbing consequences as well.<br /><br />(END OF SPOILERS)<br /><br />The Blu-ray has some nice special features including Commentary with Director Duncan Jones, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Writer Ben Ripley who pops in on occasion with some interesting insights as well. "Access: Source Code" has trivia, interviews and other bits of information that pops up almost like a picture-in-picture special feature.<br /><br />"Source Code" continues to demonstrate considerable talent from Jones and like the similiarly themed "Deja Vu" (which had a bit more flexibility with its premise), it's still a clever thriller that makes the most of its recycled premise.</p></body></html>

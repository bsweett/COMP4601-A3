Some were graphic, some were gross, some silly and some intense. The death scenes in the 3rd installment were more of a quick surprise, they would suddenly come out of nowhere, and I won't lie to ya, a couple of 'em made me jump, then say "damn that was cool" So, ya got bland acting, sensational death effects, and a incredible rollercoaster scene. Put reality and common sense away for 95 minutes and have some cheesy fun!!</p></body></html>

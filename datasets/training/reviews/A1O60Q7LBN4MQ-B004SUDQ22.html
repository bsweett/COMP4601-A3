The way it was done was slightly confusing and disorienting. Still, during it's best moments it was interesting. I can understand why someone with an mentally ill parent (and both math geniuses) worries that they will become like that too. But it was obvious to me she was just exhausted and suffering a nervous breakdown. Who wouldn't after dealing for five years with a father who is that difficult to deal with? And why shouldn't she be full of rage when you have a sister who was too selfish to help out? Being in her prime and taking care of her elderly father I can understand the rage, fear and love being so tied up together you feel crazy.<br /><br />This is a story about family bonds and stratospheric genius. It's coming to grips of who you are. It's also letting go and paradoxically embracing who and what you are and who and what you can be.</p></body></html>

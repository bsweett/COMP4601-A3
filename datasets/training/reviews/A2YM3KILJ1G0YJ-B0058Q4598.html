The reason of course is that he hardly speaks.  He somberly zombie-walks through his scenes with near lifelessness, and delivers his lines as Klaatu, premiere representative of an alien race, with the zeal of a log.  In fact, I've long said that Keanu Reeves could be replaced in nearly any of his roles by a log, and the movie would not suffer as a result.  Similar to the casting gods of Rocky IV shining down fortune on Dolph Lundgren for his role as Ivan Drago, a muscular, dim-witted, abject villain whose rigid performance is topped only by his ability to engender support from the audience for his enemies, Log pulls off the same performance, but without the muscles.<br /><br />Klaatu travels to Earth with the purpose of all alien races in movies: destroying the human race, and thereby ensuring Log doesn't make another movie.  Naturally, some idiot on Earth shoots at the alien representative - a probe called GORT that looks like a massive pewter version of the Academy Award that will forever evade Log.  According to Klaatu, the planet is in peril, and the only way to save its position as one of the few life-bearing planets in the universe is to exterminate human life as we know it.<br /><br />The brilliance of this premise is that Klaatu's own race once was in the same position, on the brink of destruction, only to change their ways for the better.  Until he has a discussion with a scholar named Prof. Barnhardt (John Cleese), the idea completely evades Klaatu that the human race could make the exact same reversal.  It's no real stretch to imagine an actual discussion between Cleese and Log ending in the same way, with Cleese completely exposing him as a simpleton.  Much like the Architect in the Matrix, Log gets outsmarted yet again.<br /><br />The bright spots in this movie are the female variety.  Kathy Bates is fairly convincing in her role as a somewhat despotic politician in the spotlight during trying times, and Jennifer Connelly plays Dr. Helen Benson, the sole person willing to be in Klaatu's presence long enough to deliver him to the truth (i.e. Prof. Barnhardt intellectual beat down).<br /><br />Remaking of a classic is usually a bad idea.  Including one of the worst actors available, adding unnecessary messages regarding contemporary ecologic and military situations, filling the screen with ridiculous special effects, and topping it all off with enough plot holes and incongruity to make Ghostbusters seem plausible is another thing entirely.<br /><br />I only recommend this movie for insomniacs, masochists, and the hundred or so delusional fans Log has across the country.</p></body></html>

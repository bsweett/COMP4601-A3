<meta name="summary" content="Weakest Coen Brothers film"></head><body><p>which, when you consider that against many other movies, ain't so bad. Nevertheless, I've seen 'em all and this is definitely their dud. As usual, the Coen Brothers are showing off their ability to create extremely strange characters, along with their signature blend of fantasy and reality, and nifty camera work. However, the plot is not all that coherent, and the characters, for all their oddity, are not that compelling. Jeff Bridges plays a burned out hippie leftover("the Dude") who, by way of having the same name as a millionaire, gets himself involved in one misunderstanding after another regarding the disappearance of the millionaire's wife. However, John Goodman steals the show as his bowling partner, a Vietnam vet with a hair trigger temper and a knack for springing into military style action when the Dude's passivity allows him. Together, they screw up one thing after another in trying to disentangle the Dude with the circumstances. What I imagine the Coen Brothers were trying to achieve here was to make the Dude into  some sort of modern Zen/Tao master/independent maverick who, by virtue of his ignorance and willingness to just let things happen to him, ekes himself out of intrigue. My belief that this is the aim of the movie is supported by Sam Elliot's narration of the story in a cowboy hat, attempting to assign some importance to the Dude's actions and style. It doesn't really all come together, really, 'cause theres nothing good about being "a dude", no matter what prism you filter him thru.<br />I'm no prude. But the f-word is bandied about so many times in this movie you get tired of hearing it. It was funny when the Soth Park kids did it, but here it grates. I imagine alot of people are going to think this is a great movie because of that and the lead character's casual and frequent pot use, and I suspect that those who thought this was one of the greatest movies theyve ever seen must have the same smoking habits as the Dude.</p></body></html>

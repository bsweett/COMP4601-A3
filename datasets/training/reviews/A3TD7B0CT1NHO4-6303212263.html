It's even above the others in the series, due to its being so genuine and true to the original story.  In fact, it goes beyond the original, to where Superman came from.  We see the original planet, with his original parents (with an expensive role from Marlon Brando), and we see the young child learning incredibly as he orbits to Earth.  Then we see the villains get banished (to come back again, of course), and then we see the crash and Superman"s (Clark's Earthly parents) pick him up and call him their own.<p>There is so many good points about this film and when he enters adulthood and meets up with Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen, you get the chills, and then there's Perry White.  Where oh where did the original series go to?  This gets better and better.<p>Christopher Reeve found his role in this movie quite well, and to watch him on film, you actually believe, through the magic of the movies, that he can fly.  <p>Gene Hackman, as "Lex Luthor" is another brilliant move, what with his evil henchman look and sarcastic humor, he pulled it off well.<p>A very enjoyable movie, and highly recommended!!!</p></body></html>

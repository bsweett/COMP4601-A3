<meta name="summary" content="An Insane New Brand Of Horror"></head><body><p>More shocking than the first "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" "The Exorcist" or even "Basket Case", and probably more extreme than the "Hellraiser" series, "The House Of 1,000 Corpses" is one of the most brutal, merciless and graphic horrors ever filmed, and certainly among the best of its extreme kind ever made.  Turns horror conventions upside down in the following way - in most horror movies, the antagonist, whether a tragic monster or a purely evil psychopath or whatever, has to have something impressive about him or her or it, some sense of awe or special-ness to make it work, and often something likable.  The inhabitants of the House, however, provide the exception to the rule.  Some of them are visually frightening, yes, but not so much in an 'impressive' way.  This is the most vile, unlikable, nastiest, most despicable band of psychos ever to terrorize the screen (even exceeding the filthbags in "Last House On The Left"(!) by virtue of the one villain in that movie who had some shred of decency and remorse within himself), and while a movie like "Candyman" works by giving the viewer a wreaker of evil who carries considerable mitigating factors and enough of a sense of tragedy to generate empathy, and "A Nightmare On Elm Street" works by putting out there a purely evil entity but one who's darkly engaging and fun to love to hate, "The House Of 1000 Corpses"'s villains are just so blood-boilingly detestable, that This is what makes this particular movie so completely riveting.  I have never rooted so hard for the hideous demise of the bad guys so much in all the years I've watched movies.  And it's utterly brilliant.<br /><br />  Set in the late 70s with a couple of apparantly intoxicated fraternity-type guys driving around and whooping it up, thinking it's a cool way to spend the evening cruising around looking for evidence of local rural legend Dr. Satan, with their exasperated and smarter girlfriends tagging along for the company and to keep their beaus from getting into too much trouble.  After picking up a female hitchhiker, it's all downhill and straight to hell for the unlucky foursome.  And yet it's not quite as straight forward as it sounds.  There'a few characters where you may not necessarily know if they're going to be part of the evil or not, there's occasional black humor amonst the mayhem, and there are shocks that aren't solely associated with just the extreme nature of the violence but are truly unexpected plot twists.  There are movies that start out frightening from the first frame, this goes it one better by starting Before the movie's opening frame with the interactive menu, featuring Captain Spaulding (played with genius by Sid Haig) talking to the viewer in a friendly manner as if he can see you right there in your front room, an amusing and almost campy way to start off the DVD that, if you let it run for a while before pressing play, starts to become very creepy and uncomfortable.<br /><br />  This is the first movie directed by industrial shock-metal master Rob Zombie (who provides plentiful music for the show, along with a lot of peppy, happy non-metal whose prescence during such brutal scenes is so inappropriate that it's unnervingly masterful).  Zombie helms the film with perhaps-unexpected skill and tremendous style and originality.  I hope to see a slew more horror movies over the years by this man (although I hope he doesn't abandon his music either), but I have to say he shows enough innovation and technical know-how that he's going to be able to direct other genres of movies too if he chooses to; anyone who shows this much talent on their debut can make any kind of film they please.  A straight drama or non-dark romantic comedy occasionally inserted in between ultra-horrors?  I don't see why not.  How about it, Mr. Zombie - show the critics that horror specialists are every bit the equal of any other genre's masters.<br /><br />  One of the best horror movies of 2003 (possibly horror's greatest year ever).  Not recommended for non-diehards of horor though.  If you're just getting into the field, you might want to try some of the many other horror movies that are just as great and often just as scary, but not as gorily graphic, like the "Halloween" series or "The Blair Witch Project", before something this demented, and then see "House Of 1000 Corpses" after a while.<br /><br />  On a closing note, what's perhaps even scarier is that Zombie apparantly plans to make the upcoming sequel, "The Devil's Rejects" even darker and more gruesome, and its villains even More despicable.  He's set himself a hard task, but to think that he just might be up to it....Yikes!</p></body></html>

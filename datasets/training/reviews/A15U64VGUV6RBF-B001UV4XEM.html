The characters are put in the most ridiculous situations as they attempt to recall the events of the previous night, and their responses and reactions are what drive the movie forward. This premise could easily have been made into a lesser movie (see Hangover II), but Todd Phillips takes them to the farthest edge of Vegas and beyond. Personally I don't recall ever laughing as hard as I did when the guys are just coming to after their debauchery and discovering what has happened to their hotel suite. If you're one of the 5 people or so who haven't see this yet, what are you waiting for? Comedy classic.</p></body></html>

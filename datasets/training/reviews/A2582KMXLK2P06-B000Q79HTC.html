<meta name="summary" content="a good film for action cravers"></head><body><p>The Bourn Identity is a pretty good action film.  To give you a brief idea of the storyline- a man wakes up in the ocean (Matt Damon's character) has absolutely NO idea where he is, realizes he doesn't remember anything from the past two weeks prior to the incident, meets an attractive young woman while in the city, and they both spend the entire time running from the police around Germany and France.<br /><br />While it's a pretty easy plotline to follow, it unfortunately does contain some unsatisfyingly dry and quiet moments that feel really tacked on and unnecessary, dragging the overall score down a few notches.<br /><br />Also, I was never really sure whether Damon's character had superhero strengths, or whether these devastating moves of his were just your typical far-fetched action segments on the part of the Hollywood directors.  I'm not necessarily complaining about it- just wondering if those power moves he was delivering to the bad guys had an explanation of some sorts, or were we not supposed to acknowledge Damon's amazing power?<br /><br />Lots of shooting, fighting, and yes, even some romance scenes take up a good portion of The Bourn Identity.  Not a bad film however.</p></body></html>

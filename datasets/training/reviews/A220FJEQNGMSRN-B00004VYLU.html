<meta name="summary" content="A great 90-minute movie dragged out over two-and-a-half hours"></head><body><p>Following the progress of gangster Ray Liotta and his relationship with mentors Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, Goodfellas is the kind of film you'll either think is a masterpiece or wonder what all the fuss was about. Performances are all outstanding, Scorsese's direction energetic and innovative, but somewhere around the halfway point you may wonder where it's going and come to the conclusion that great performances and grandstanding direction is all its about. There's no shortage of outstanding scenes but the film becomes increasingly repetitive as it underlines and escalates its variations on a theme until it feels like it's all style with nothing more underneath than a two-and-a-half hour episode of Lifestyles of the Rich and Infamous.<br /><br />Good extras on the two-disc version, but it's hard to buy into all the hype for the film.</p></body></html>

It makes a good cinematic introduction to Buddhism,superior to the Buddhism/Taoism lite of Star Wars. Dark City even leaves the viewer with questions,making the shiny happy ending bittersweet.<br /><br />Rufus Sewell,who resembles a young Ian McShane,is John Murdock,an insomniac who has been framed for murder.While he's trying to solve the mystery,he encounters the detective,Bumstead,a half-hearted performance from William Hurt, and the mad stuttering scientist Dr.Schreber,expertly played by Kiefer Sutherland. Sutherland shows his versatility as an actor;in contrast to his character on "24",he plays a maddened,bumbling scientist. Jennifer Connelly stars as Anna,John's wife. Her role is primarily to be a double agent&a damsel in distress.<br /><br />In the end,John learns that the Strangers (who look like a cross between the Borg,Nosferatu&Pinhead) are trying to find out what makes humans human through their experiments,and want to be immortal because their race is dying out. Since they're all male (except for a demon child),one wonders if an alternate title could be "The Matrix Needs Women." The last battle between John&the leader of the Strangers (Ian Richardson,who was an evil British Prime Minister in a BBC series)is a cheesy metaphysical shoot 'em up.It goes on and on and on.It comes across as a staring contest crossed with a fireworks show.<br /><br />However,the movie brings up intriguing ideas,especially Buddhist ones. Sutherland's character brings up reincarnation ("you have lived many lives"),that reality is an illusion,and that it's a person's responsibility to create their own world.In the last battle,he tells Sewell that he "must concentrate." Concentration is important to all forms of Buddhism.<br /><br />There are also aspects of Dark City that are intriguingly open-ended:<br />Were the Strangers a figment of John's imagination? Was he hallucinating due to his insomnia?<br />Where were the people of the Dark City from before they were abducted?<br />Was it all John's dream?<br />When John reunites with his wife,is he still within the Dark City,making memories that are only an illusion?<br /><br />While the movie has its cheesy aspects (the Strangers floating around,having hilarious names&menacingly intoning "Sleep"),it does bring up fascinating philosophical questions.It makes for fun viewing.</p></body></html>

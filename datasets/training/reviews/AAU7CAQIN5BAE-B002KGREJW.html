This was one of the most disappointing times of my movie viewing year. For the past 12 months, in my circles, I have heard nothing but praise and accolades for 'Little Miss Sunshine'. These accolades coming from 11 year old girls to 80 year old men, to film school students who praise this as a hidden gem of 'raw-art-situational comedy'. Everyone telling me in every way imaginable, "Oh Ken you have to see this movie. It's so amazing. It speaks to so many people on so many different avenues." Hmmm, clearly I am driving on an isolationist freeway.<br /><br />While there were tender moments (Paul Dano (L.I.E.) talking with the gay Steve C. (Dan in Real Life) on the docks about doing what you want to do and screwing morals and society's judgements), I seemed to be wondering when in fact the movie would become something of importance or interest. It failed on all fronts to move me to understand it's purpose, albeit trying to be hilariously funny. While the opening scenes point to a storyline with depth and tender emotions, (save the regurgated use of the word cliche) it guts what little it can delve out, with unwitty righteous ensemble displays of earnest and ill will towards Alan Arkin trying desperately to be comedic. On a sidenote, Paul Dano has intense potential, despite anyone with a pulse being able to play his roll as the quiet, isolated teenage son, he comes through when he breaks his silence with his outburst in the suburbian field, and like Jamie Bell (UnderTow, Billy Elliott) he is not afraid to take on roles which clearly shows the depth of his craft as his performances are dynamic, intriguing, diverse and controversial. We should watch his career with great intrigue.<br /><br />Uniformly, LMS falls on almost every attempt to try almost effortlessly to shine as an art-house indie flick with that sub-genre of psuedo-intellectuals who think films like these are progressively artistic in their endeavors to speak to everyone in some way. In fact it can't seem to find solid ground, save Alan Arkin who's incessant use of the F word was uncalled for in its excess. I am sheltered in believing that this little film was to be a shining, roving example of what is lacking in Hollywood, and how a low budget movie can bring momentum to an often saturated industry filled with massive CGI mega blockbusters and B Movie straight to DVD trash. However, it can only take this movie lover to a certain level of cynicism in wondering:<br /><br />what...all...the...hype...was...about.<br /><br />Ken, January '08</p></body></html>

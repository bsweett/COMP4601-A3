When you first look at the cover of it and even hear the title, you would think that it would be a very scary and very violent movie. Well, anyway, that's what I thought. Until I finally watched it. And to tell you the truth, it wasn't as bad as I thought at all! Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith are great as 'the men in black', agents who watch over the population of aliens on the planet earth. This is a very funny movie with lots of great action scenes, too. Language might be a bit strong for younger kids but I'm sure teenagers and adults will love this movie as much as I did!</p></body></html>

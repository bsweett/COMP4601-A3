<meta name="summary" content="Fun film!"></head><body><p>King Arthur is one of the films that surprised me. I love the story of Arthur and I'm just very happy that this didn't disappoint. It may be somewhat inaccurate historically,  but the film is still really fun and the acting is excellent. You wil cheer for the heroes as they fight the Saxons in this film. Nothing else can really be said that hasn't but this worth seeing</p></body></html>

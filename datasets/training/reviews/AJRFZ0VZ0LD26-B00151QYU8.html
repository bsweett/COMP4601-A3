Besides "Good Will Hunting", this is another one of those efforts.  Cast of the movie is fantastic.  Alan Rickman is great in his role as voice of God and it is delightfull surprise to learn that the God is in form of beautiful and serene Alanis Morisette.  Chris Rock will not fail you as one of the "forgotten" apostole (13th one that happens to be black).  Unless you are an individual  too serious about your Catholic faith, or just too God fearing Christian in general, you will find this movie to be smart, funny and very entertaining.  I will be the first one to admit that I did not expect much of this movie and I got a very nice treat.  This is one of the comedies that you will always think of fondly  - if you are humble enough to laugh at yourself.  I believe that every one of us can see themselves or someone close we know in this colorful display of characters.</p></body></html>

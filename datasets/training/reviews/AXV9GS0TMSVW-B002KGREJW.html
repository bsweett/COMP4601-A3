<meta name="summary" content="Dysfunction and failure never felt so good"></head><body><p>The setup is pretty simple.  A dysfunctional family goes on a road trip so a little girl can achieve her dream of being in a beauty pageant.  Yet the beauty pageant in question is merely a catalyst for a family to realize its own shortcomings and unite and agreee on...something.<br /><br />Greg Kinear is a father who is banking on the success of a 12 step self help program while his wife played by Toni Collette is putting up with the uncertainty of their future along with the suicide attempt by her brother played by Steve Carell. His character is a college professor who attempts suicide because of unrequited love from a fellow colleague. Paul Dano is the son who aspires to be an air force pilot whilst looking up to Nietsche and outright proclaiming his hatred for his family.  Alan Arkin is a profanity spewing and drug taking grandfather.  Somewhere in the midst of this, Olive, the young dauther, seems oblivious to the dysfuntion going on and just wants to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine Beauty Paegant.<br /><br />The road trip that ensues plays on their dysfunction, with witty exchanges between the talented performers.  The chemistry between Paul Dano and Steve Carrel is most affecting, despite the fact that Paul Dano doesn't talk for a good 2/3 of the film.<br /><br />All of the characters have aspirations they can't quite achieve - like a desire overeaching their actual potential.  This is perhaps the most original concept the film has to offer.  In the end, it's ultimately about failure which is a sad concept for a comedy to address.  That the film is so funny and makes you feel so good at the end is an amazing feat.  The finale is a little over the top for my tastes, but there is something so human and honest about these characters that you can't help but want to jump in and help get their VW van on the road again.</p></body></html>

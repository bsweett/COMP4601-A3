The trailer leads you to believe that this movie is a horror film, or at the least, a supernatural thriller.<br /><br />I'm inclined to catagorize the film with the latter description, although the "supernatural" element remains more or less a mystery and the movie does not focus too much on that point.<br /><br />It does focus, however, on the phenomenon that Sandra Bullock's character is forced to endure over and over again. This phenomenon is never fully explained, only hinted at, and that one fact left me somewhat disappointed.<br /><br />However, once you get to the end of the movie and realize it's message, that one element lacking explanation doesn't really seem to matter. The movie has a beautiful message and that message is; every day of life that we have is a miracle.<br /><br />Bullock delivers an excellent performance, as usual, and it was nice to see Julian McMahon portray a character who was actually a decent (if not troubled and confused) man rather than the megalomaniacal jerks he usually plays (such as his role in Nip/Tuck and Fantastic Four).<br /><br />I enjoyed this film very much as did my wife. The picture and sound quality are both well-done. We especially enjoyed the gag reel after the film was over. It was helpful to get a few genuine laughs after such a tear-jerker of an ending.<br /><br />The reviews are pretty mixed on this one, so you might want to try giving this one a rental before you buy. Like me, others may have pre-conceived notions about the nature of this film and could possibly be disappointed. I, for one, was pleasantly surprised.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Western Perfection"></head><body><p>This review refers to the Warner Bros DVD edition of THE SEARCHERS..<br /><br />THE SEARCHERS from 1956... Do they come any better than this? The Duke is a war weary ex-confederate who becomes obsessed with hunting down the Comanche tribe who has massacred his family and kidnapped his young niece. We follow him for years as he will not let go of his mission or his beliefs. Wayne is amazing in this role as we see his hatred turn into humanity. This film has it all for the Western lover. It is from Director John Ford, and may just be his masterpiece. It is filmed in technicolor, and the stunning scenery may be viewed in the original widescreen(taking in all the action and rugged terrain), but also has the option of a standard version. It also stars Hollywood greats Jeffrey Hunter, Vera Miles, Ward Bond and Natalie Wood.<br /><br />Contrary to the editorial reviews here, I thought the transfer of this  film from 1956 looked wonderful. The picture was clean and clear with very good sound. There are a couple of documentary shorts included, made at the time of the shoot, one has a brief interview with Natalie Wood(glowing from her recent Oscar nomination for REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE). It may be viewed in or with subtitles in English, French and Spanish, and it also contains some production notes.<br /><br />For big fans of The Duke or John Ford, or great American Westerns in general, you may want to consider purchasing this DVD in the John Wayne Collection: (The Cowboys/The Searchers/Stagecoach). Not only is it a great selection of Wayne's works, spanning 30 years, but check the prices individually, it could be the better deal. They each come in their own snap case and have an outer sleeve for the set.<br /><br />Saddle Up once again with The Duke for a great adventure and a powerful story.<br /><br />Happy Trails....Laurie</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good movie"></head><body><p>This movie isn't exactly like the book, nor should one expect it to be. On its own, it really is a good movie, and I liked James McAvoy and Cate Blanchett in their roles as Tumnus and the White Queen respectively. Great special effects as well, so overall it's a good movie and if you liked the book, you should enjoy this as well.</p></body></html>

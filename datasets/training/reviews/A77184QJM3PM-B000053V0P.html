Many stars appear here, and several give top-notch performances. Judd Hirsch gives a great turn as Jeff Goldblum's dad, and Will Smith gives a star-making turn as the air corp pilot who heroically helps save the human race. Jeff Goldblum gives his usual intense performance as the lead scientist who happens upon the code the aliens are using and also helps save the human race. I know this sounds VERY hokey, but it's all part of the special charm of the film. All this is secondary to the special effects here. This film won the Academy Awards for best visual effects and best sound, and believe me, it richly deserved them. The destruction of New York, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C. are as awe-inspiring now as when the film came out in 1996. So many Sci-Fi movies seem to disappoint in one way or another, most of them take themselves way too seriously to be enjoyed. Believe me, this film is a fun ride from start to finish. Never mind the glaring ridiculousness of some of the plot lines, the movie just scoots along happily, and you just need some suspension of disbelief to thoroughly enjoy this. The tranfer to DVD is flawless, the picture is razer-sharp, and the sound is staggering. Several bonus features are here, and all are your basic bonus stuff. Check out the original biplane ending feature, it's so great to see that something so outrageous as an old biplane taking out a huge alien ship was actually considered at all! Anyway, this film is nonstop fun, and should make a great addition your collection.</p></body></html>

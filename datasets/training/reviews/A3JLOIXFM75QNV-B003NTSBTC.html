<meta name="summary" content="A tricky film- Major Spoilers Ahead"></head><body><p>Shutter Island is a very ambiguous film. I knew exactly what direction it was going in about halfway through it, and yet, after the credits rolled, my mind was a jumble trying to decipher what I just watched. In my opinion, I don't think the ending was as crystal clear as the film would like you to believe. The 'Is Teddy sane or insane?' arguments are abundant on the internet. The movie would like you to believe that he is indeed, insane and there is proof from the very beginning. However, one can counter that for all the evidence, it can still very easily be twisted so that the other argument wins out. It is not as dry cut as it appears, or as they state. This movie desperately needs multiple viewings.<br /><br />In my mind, the final truth that confirmed the 'sane' argument was that final haunting shot of the lighthouse. The people that saw this film know what I am talking about. There are so many theories going around and I honestly think the whole point of this film is to make people crazy trying to figure everything out.<br /><br />Many people who don't like Shutter Island call it a cop-out and a huge 'gocha!' joke. I can see how that would frustrate someone-that is, if you believe the 'insane' argument. This can go back and forth. I havent seen a movie like this in ages, where you go back in your mind days after watching it and still try to reason things out.<br /><br />The performances are top-notch and the cinematography is just stunning. The colors are bold in a non-colorful way, but they stand out nonetheless. The imagery and lighting really sets the tone and I actually loved the over-the-top musical score. It almost made it seem like you were in the middle of a horror film, which this is not. But it still fits so perfectly because it really is the ideal way to set the scene, especially when it revolves around a creepy mental asylum.<br /><br />Truly, I would go into this film knowing as little about it as possible and allow the suspense and mystery to overtake you.</p></body></html>

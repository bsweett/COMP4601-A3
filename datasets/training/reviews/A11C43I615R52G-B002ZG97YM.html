<meta name="summary" content="Dreamworks Best!!"></head><body><p>I have to say that when a Dreamworks Animation film is released my hopes aren't high. From my point of view, they aim mostly for cheap laughs with mediocre stories. However, sometimes they do hit the right string and deliver a throughfully entertaining film with great visuals, characters and story. So far, from the 20-plus films that Dreamworks had released since its foundation, I found only five worth seeing and owning (Shrek, Shrek 2, Chicken Run, Wallace & Gromit and Kung Fu Panda). When I walked to a Dreamworks film I never have high hopes like when I enter a Pixar film (all of which are excellent). This year was not the exception and when I saw trailers for How to Train Your Dragon, I never got too much excited about it. All I have to say is that I couldn't be more wrong!!<br /><br />For the first time, I feel that Dreamworks did a film that can be up there with the Pixar catalogue. I haven't seen such a great film produced by Dreamworks since the first Shrek was released. This movie is an instant classic!!<br /><br />Instead of aiming for sitcom-esque jokes like most of his films, HTTYD has what all Pixar films have: a wide appeal. This film can be enjoyed by every member of the family and has a good quality humor and most important of all, a heart (a thing that is usually missing from Dreamworks). Add breathtaking visuals, a magnificent score, action, great characters and you have one of the most compelling animated films of all time. I still think Pixar is better and in fact I think Toy Story 3 is better than this one but without a doubt with HTTYD, Dreamworks make a huge step formward and became closer to Pixar (a step that may have gone backwards again with the fourth and hopefully last Shrek). Do I have more confidence in Dreamworks films? Not really, we'll have to see how Megamind and future films stand. But even if is the beginning of a new era for Dreamworks or an isolated success, HTTYD is a masterpiece.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray transfer is gorgoeus.You can see every detail in the screen, absolutely magnificent. The 5.1 dolby true HD is equally impressive. The are many nice bonus features (including a new short). Most of them are short but they are fun to watch nontheless.<br /><br />The DVD provided here also looks great for SD but is no match for the BD quality.<br /><br />How To Train Your Dragon is an excellent film that is completely recommended (even if you don? have kids like myself). Congratulations to Dreamworks for showing us that when they want to, they can do great things. Let's hope more films like this one will come in the future from this studio.</p></body></html>

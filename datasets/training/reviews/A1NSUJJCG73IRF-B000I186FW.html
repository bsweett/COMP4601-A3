<meta name="summary" content="V for Vendetta (2006)"></head><body><p>Director:  James McTeigue<br /><br />Cast:  Natalie Portman, Hugo Weaving, Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry, John Hurt, Tim Pigott-Smith, Rupert Graves, Roger Allam, Ben Miles.<br /><br />Running Time: 132 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for strong violence and some language.<br /><br />After a disappointing outcome in making "The Matrix" into a totally forgettable trilogy, the Wachowski brothers write a new film tackling the issues of terrorism and corruption between the bureaucratic governments in this futuristic look of Britain. As for newcomer James McTeigue, who served as an assistant director on the "Matrix films", provides a unique film that, while it drags slightly and takes time to make its point, is enthralling and entertaining nonetheless.  In a state of government that is controlled by a tyrant and is in a state of civil war, there's nowhere safe for anyone that is a possible suspect of terrorism. With corrupt leaders and crooked officers, there is only one thing that is suspected of this and that is the right to rebel against the government. Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman, "Episode 3: Attack of the Clones" and "Garden State") becomes cornered in a dark alley by several government officers who have only one thing on their mind. Luckily she is saved from the power hungry officers by a man in black that wears a Guy-Fawkes mask and whose weapon of choice is the dozen of daggers that he carries around. She's intrigued by the man in black (played by "The Matrix" trilogy's Hugo Weaving), who has no second thought of using violence as a mean of expression for his rebellious ideas, who latter has been labeled as the terrorist of the new generation and given the name "V". With her curiosity, Evey is kidnapped by V and learns of his lifestyles that he carries on. Meanwhile, Inspector Eric Finch, (Stephen Rea, in a fine supporting role) is questioning the authority of the nations dictator (John Hurt), whose face is blown up on a large movie screen as he dictates his committee, displaying his ego and attempt to be intimidating to his council. As the film progresses, you begin to learn the reasoning for V's acts of terrorism involving explosions of national monuments and the mentality that violence is the only way to rebel.<br /><br />"V for Vendetta" is not your average blockbuster film. Instead of mind blowing stunts constantly thrown at the audience, the focus is on the dilemmas on the characters. Our antihero V is out for revenge on the government that created the man he is. Using anarchy as a weapon, V shakes the people out of their oppression and takes a stand against their corrupt government. Evey, while unwillingly ends entangled into V's plan, joins V's alliance. Officer Finch starts to question his ethics of loyalty to his government, when he starts to uncover a disturbing conspiracy. While based on Alan Moore's graphic novels, the film has a distinct similarity to George Orwell's"1984". Free thought is taken away, cultures seen radical are abolished, homosexuality unaccepted, televisions everywhere watching and monitoring your conversations; Big Brother is watching. The political side plays second fiddle to much, when it should have been in the forefront all the time. There are some startling references to history; Nazi Germany, Gay Fawkes, while looking at our modern state; war on terrorism. The problem with V for Vendetta is that it's a mix affair. The beginning is chaotic and unfocused. Much like when Neo meets the Architect in "Matrix Reloaded", the Wachowski Brothers are throwing the thesaurus at you, with V spitting as many V words in one sentence. "Vendetta" takes its time to focus, though when it does really gets the gears moving in sync. First time director James McTeigue, does a strong job, with flare for great visuals and artistry.<br /><br />When your face holds the most expression and insight into a person, Hugo Weaving has a hard task of bringing expression to a man behind a Gay Fawkes mask. With great mannerisms and a commanding voice, Weaving is immaculate as V. Natalie Portman provides a fine performance as Evey, even with a shaved head she is still beautiful. Stephen Rea and Stephen Fry are both great. John Hurt is disturbing as Adam Sutler, booming with such a spiteful voice.  When the year 1984 approached, people wondered if George Orwell's vision of the future would come into fruition. With the year 2020 just around the corner, will "V for Vendetta" do the same; probably not. Though with provocative and somewhat controversial subject matter, it does raise questions, and food for thought.</p></body></html>

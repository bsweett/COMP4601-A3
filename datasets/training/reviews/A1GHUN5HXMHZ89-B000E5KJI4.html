The fact there is a good storyline with it won't hide the fact this is a movie about epic men and women and great bloody battles. I must say though the gore was not overdone as in some movies. This is no worse than "Ben Hur" or some other of that caliber. I enjoyed it thoroughly since I thought the casting and acting was great. The love stories and tradgedies follow the true stories fairly well. The timeline is a bit askew but we are no worse off for that. We get the overall story and see where the lines "Beware Greeks Bearing Gifts" and "Achilles Heel" come from.<br /><br />There are those that would think Brad Pitt was not right for the part of Achilles, but if that was so, he did a fine job of making it his part. His fights were choregraphed meticuously and are worth seeing the movie for alone. The detailed methods of fighting showed me some moves that I had not seen in this type movie before but make perfect since to me. Afterall a moving target is hard to hit, and Achilles moves very well. I recommend it if you enjoy this type movie. Personally I like these real people movies over the CGI types. You can feel their sweat and blood. I think most the family can watch this as it is no different in theme than many of the classic sword and sandal movies. Excellent quality DVD with good replayability.</p></body></html>

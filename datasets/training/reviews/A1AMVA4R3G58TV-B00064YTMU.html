<meta name="summary" content="Cruise if the Perfect Bad Guy"></head><body><p>I really enjoyed Collateral. Tom Cruise's character Vincent is a contract killer who uses an innocent Taxi Driver named Max played by Jamie Foxx, to drive him around town as he  kills his victims. Vincent assures Max that these are all "bad people" but as the story goes on you realize Vincent can't be trusted with anything he says.<br /><br />Tom Cruise plays this evil character with alot of depth and complexity. You start to see that he is actually very warped and evil.  Jamie Foxx's character starts to wonder just how psycho this person is and you can tell he realizes this situation is getting worse and worse.<br /><br />Jada Pinkett Smith plays the Attorney who rides with max before Vincent. She and Max flirt and it creates a very interesting plot twist. Mark Ruffalo plays a detective trying to hunt down the killers of the murder victims. Ruffalo was so good in his role, that at first I didn't even realize it was him.<br /><br />I could see an Oscar nomination for Tom Cruise with this movie. His character is so complex, and Cruise portrays him with perfection.</p></body></html>

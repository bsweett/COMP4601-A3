Well, I've never been a huge fan of horror, but in order to improve my cinematic horizons, I have been watching a lot of schlock and horror lately and finally viewed THE EXORCIST. My impression: what in the world is the big deal? Outside of superb acting and some neat special effects, THE EXORCIST isn't that great. The writing is terrible and contains loads of dialogue that when found in other movies is referred to as "cheesy" and "unimaginative." The movie moves at an incredibly slow pace, so much so that I almost fell asleep fifteen minutes into the film. The movie makes hardly any explanation of what is going on or why (I know this is a film that's supposed to make one think, but good thinking movies give a foundation from where people can begin to form their assumptions and ideas; this movie has no such foundation). The film has several major plot holes. The ending is predictable (come on, who didn't know the priests were going to die in the end?). The film paints Christianity in a negative light, picturing it to be something leftover from the Medieval Ages. And lastly, the movie really isn't that scary.<p>I guess that the reason so many people find this film so frightening is that they think something like it could happen to them. There must be a lot of people out there who are totally unsure about their salvation and the state of their eternal souls. Something like what happens in the movie would not happen to someone who is a Christian. Of course, Biblically speaking, it probably would not happen to an innocent (young child) either. Watching the movie, I got the idea that Linda Blair's character wasn't all that innocent. Even before she becomes possessed she hints at sexual promiscuity she has been involved with and some of her earlier actions with her mother and servants aren't all that innocent either.<p>I will admit that the acting is done well and some of the special effects are pretty cool. However, other than that, there really isn't any reason to see this film. I find it difficult that it is held in such high regard.</p></body></html>

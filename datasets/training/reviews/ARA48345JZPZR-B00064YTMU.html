This riveting thriller combines nicely etched characters, sharp and pointed dialogue, explosive action and violence, delivered with the intelligence, wit and intensity Mann brilliantly brings to the genre.  Like Tarantino, Michael Mann knows when the extreme closeup of his actors faces is all that is required to reveal character and mood and that cross-cutting this intimacy with superbly choreographed violence creates atmosphere and tension lacking from the films of their less-gifted bretheren.<br /><br />The film just plain looks great.  Michael Mann captures the nighttime streets of LA in as mesmerizing a way as his daytime shootout on those same streets in Heat was simply un-toppable.  Beyond the look, the choices of locales, and the mood and pace of the film are spot-on.<br /><br />Tom Cruise is terrific in this role and is matched all the way by Jamie Foxx.  It is basically a two character drama, so the two leads had to carry their weight and they did so admirably.  I had no trouble accepting "pretty-boy" Cruise as a ruthless, coldly calculating, remorseless and relentless contract killer.  It is a very nice piece of work.  Jamie Foxx has the more difficult "straight-man" role, and he acquits himself well.<br /><br />The production is meticulous.  The supporting cast, down to the smallest role, is perfect, with Jada Pinkett Smith and Mark Ruffalo carrying the largest support, but also fine cameos by Javier Bardham and others.<br /><br />This is class work by a fine director, cast and crew.  The 5 stars are, of course, for fans of thrillers.  The story may be a stretch with a bit of a hole here and there, the climax almost Terminator-like in relentlessness, but you will be hard pressed to find a more intense or better thriller anywhere.  This is the movies folks, done by people who know how to make em!</p></body></html>

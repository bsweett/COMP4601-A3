<meta name="summary" content="Fun movie...with lots of problems"></head><body><p>Like the first one, this second transformer movie can be enjoyed but dont expect<br />too much.  It might be exciting for a 8 year old, but after a while the continous<br />transformations will put you to sleep due to lack of good substance called acting<br />and story.  I hear they want to make a 3rd movie, they should consider the following:<br />  1. Dump Meagan Fox....or get her to act...not just a pretty shinny face.<br />  2. Hire better writters.<br />  3. Stop making the parents that dumb... its kind of embarassing.</p></body></html>

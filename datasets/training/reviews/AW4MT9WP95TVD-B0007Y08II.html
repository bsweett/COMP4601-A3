An over-the-top send-up of action films and politics it almost always hits its gag target for a good laugh.<br /><br />The puppet work is excellent and very expressive and the characters are voiced so well that at times you forget that you are watching marionettes.<br /><br />The sex scene is absolutely histerical as is the finale in South Korea.  Highly recommended if you have a twisted sense of humor and a strong stomach.</p></body></html>

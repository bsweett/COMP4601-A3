<meta name="summary" content="A Different Kind of Buddy Movie"></head><body><p>Richard Shepard's The Matador presents a new take on the assassin film. No longer the stuff of the Steven Segal movie of the week, Shepard presents his gunman as a man on the verge of total collapse looking for a friend and loooking for a way out of his profession.<br /><br />Pierce Brosnan gives a career defining performance as Julien Noble, a burned out hitman, on his way to collapse. After four James Bond films this is the ultimate anti-Bond film. The character is disheveled, unsure of himself and definately not the ladies man we are used to seeing Brosnan play. The other side of the pair is Greg Kinnear as Danny Wright a mid level businessman on the verge of losing his job and possibly his wife played by Hope Davis.<br /><br />Far from the normal buddy film, Shepard allows his characters to develope slowly so that the audience truly understands their plight. This is a character driven film with intelligent dialogue and few thrills. Give time the audience begins to care about these people and the lives that they lead.<br /><br />The are fine performances on both sides of the camera. David Tattersall, who shot the last Star Wars film does a great job  making the film look like a much more expensive affair than it actually was. Robert Pearson's production design effectively doubles the Mexico City shooting location for many cities keeping things interesting.<br /><br />The DVD comes packed with many extras including a making of featurette, two complete radio shows in which Shepard discusses the writing of the film and its reception at the Sundance Film Festival, two commentaries featuring Shepard and his stars and a trailer.<br /><br />Check out this small gem of independant filmmaking.</p></body></html>

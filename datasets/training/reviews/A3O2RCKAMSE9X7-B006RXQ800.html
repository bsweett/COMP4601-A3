<meta name="summary" content="Gangs of New York: Spectacular but Unconvincing"></head><body><p>GANGS OF NEW YORK has been hailed as a magnificent recreation of a pre-Civil War New York torn by racial and ethnic prejudice.  Others label it in the same words but without the qualifier 'magnificent.'  The truth is probably somewhere in between.  Director Martin Scorsese clearly wanted GANGS OF NEW YORK to fit in with his frequent mythological interpretations of purely American character and history.  Scorsese succeeds in capturing the overblown essence that was surely the chaotic mess of the Boss Tweed era.  However dangerous New York might seem today, the proliferation of gangs and crooked cops make the waterfront section of the Five Points seem as hostile as Beirut ever was.  In nearly every scene, Scorcese places muggers, burning buildings, hookers, pickpockets, and urban warfare.  <p>The unifying theme that Scorcese sought was that of revenge, most often for the murder of a family member.  There are no less than three separate examples of revenge sought as a reason to wreak further havoc.  The primary seeker is, of course, Amsterdam Vallon, hugely miscast by Leonardo DiCaprio.  In nearly every scene that DiCaprio is in, he shows no more emotion than the ubiquitous picture of his late father shows.  The only exception is the fistfight between him and one of Bill the Butcher's lackeys.  For a child who saw his father killed in street warfare, DiCaprio as an adult is remarkably unconcerned.  He is meant to be the dramatic center, but he is so lacking in the gravitas required of an action hero, that the audience by default looks elsewhere.  This dramatic vacuum is soon filled by Daniel-Day Lewis, who plays Bill 'the Butcher' Cutter, in one of the most memorable screen villain performances ever.  Lewis steals the show in much the same way that James Earl Jones did as Darth Vader in STAR WARS.  Lewis struts, rhapsodizes, bullies, and tosses knives as he embodies the very essence of a thug who knows how to build and to maintain a criminal empire.  He even engages the audience's sympathy as he shows himself to be a 'butcher' more in the job sense than in the psychological one.  He kills people, true enough, but he does so with his own hands.  His cohort-in-crime, Boss Tweed kills far more in allowing New York to be a cesspool that gobbles up thousands of disembarking Irish on a daily basis. Further, Bill as the Butcher, kills Amsterdam Vallon's father in fair and open combat and even praises his fallen foe as a worthy opponent whose corpse ought not be defiled.  Cameron Diaz as Jenny the pickpocket has little to do but first attract Amsterdam's attentions then heal his physical wounds.  <p>The lasting impression of GANGS OF NEW YORK is how Scorcese depicts the anarchy that was New York during the anti-draft riots of the Civil War.  The swirling gangs with colorful names like the Plug-Uglies, the Dead Rabbits, and the Bowery Boys are seen ultimately as the collective consciousness of a city that was being inundated by immigrants who themselves were immigrants only one generation past but now call themselves 'nativists.' Given the length of the film (167 minutes) it would have been difficult for any director to keep the audience focused on the titular hero.  But in this case, Scorsese unwittingly proved once again that a charismatic villain can easily overshadow a bland hero to such an extent that the audience identifies more with this villain than either with the hero or the plot.  Still, the resounding spectacle makes GANGS OF NEW YORK required viewing.</p></body></html>

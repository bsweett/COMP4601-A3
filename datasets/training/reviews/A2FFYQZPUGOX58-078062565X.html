The New York tugboats are backing away.  You are shouting commands and waving your arms about, when, unexpectedly, your hand smacks something behind you; it felt soft.  You turn and find a young woman rubbing her chin.<br /><br />It's Ann Darrow.  She's that woman that Carl Denham brought aboard last night.  She is to star in his new picture.  The trouble is, women aboard a ship are a nuisance, but then Denham is paying for this trip.  You brusquely tell her to stay out of the way; however, for all your gruffness, you are secretly pleased that she is aboard.<br /><br />It took more than six weeks to reach the Indian Ocean and find Denham's uncharted isle.  Masses of rock jut skyward from its jungle floor; sea cliffs overlook the breakers; the only access is a sandy beach along a tapering peninsula; and separating it from the jungle is an enormous stone wall.<br /><br />Upon landing, you find the villager's preparing a girl for sacrifice, but when they offer a trade for Ann, you retreat to the ship.  That night, you finally tell Ann that you love her.  You are called away.  The next time you see her, she is in the clutches of an enormous beast.  You chase it through the jungles, swamps, canyons, and cliffs; your ears ring with the screams of your mates and the roars of the dinosaurs.  Oh Ann!<br /><br />Overall:  The best adventure-monster movie ever made!  It's a well-crafted story, chock full of suspense and action.  Listen closely to the dialog; it's loaded with preludes of actions to come.  This movie defines the word: classic.<br /><br />Picture (DVD): 3, a few minor defects.</p></body></html>

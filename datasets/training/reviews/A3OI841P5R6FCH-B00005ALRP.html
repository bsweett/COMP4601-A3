<meta name="summary" content="Great movie, but Special Edition extras only so-so"></head><body><p>When I first saw 'The Fugitive', I was hoping that it didn't fall into the trap of silliness that most TV-show based feature films have fallen into (remember 'Car 54', or 'Wild Wild West'?). Needless to say, I was more than pleasantly surprised to see that it went WAY beyond my low expectations! Great moments of suspense, action, and plot twists galore!<br /><br />Harrison Ford's been knocked for not putting much 'feeling' into some of his roles. But if there are emotions he does do well, it's desperation and determined stoicism with a touch of sarcasm... a perfect fit for a fugitive out to clear his name. As well, Tommy Lee Jones is a lock as U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard- he plays the character's somewhat cocky and no-nonsense attitude to perfection. He also gets the best lines, and a pretty good supporting cast playing his U.S. Marshal Service cohorts (including the recently- recognized Joe Pantoliano). It's scenery-chewing at it's best, and definitely an Oscar-worthy perfomance.<br /><br /> Their performances of the two main characters and antagonists is so compelling that, like my fellow reviewers have stated before, I was rooting for the both of them throughout the presentation. It's two 'good guys' against each other, with one helping lead the other to the same end!<br /><br /> When I heard about the Special Edition DVD release, I was kinda bummed. I'd already spent a few bucks on the original release, and never anticipated the possibility of an enhanced version. But, thanks to those wonderful buyers on eBay, I got a good return on my original disc at a minimal loss, and grabbed a copy of the new one.<br /><br /> The new  disc isn't half-bad, but doesn't quite match up to the standards of other fully-loaded DVD fare as `T2 Ultimate Edition' or `The Abyss'. It features teasers, trailers, and a few behind-the-scenes bits, including the setup &amp; shooting of the train wreck. Davis even discusses a `flub' following the wreck that was cut out of the original video version, but was then digitally corrected and restored in this DVD release! And no, I'm not gonna tell you about it- you'll have to see it for yourself!<br /><br /> The commentary track by director Andrew Davis and Tommy Lee Jones was not one of the better feature-length commentaries I've experienced. There are parts where neither of them speak for a couple minutes on end, almost like they didn't have that much to say about the movie in the first place. Jones' commentary was minimal, with mostly throwaway-type observations that didn't really add much to the track.<br /><br /> And now, my biggest gripe: Warner is STILL using cardboard snap cases for their digital discs! You'd think they'd've gotten out of the DVD Stone Age by now...<br /><br />'Late</p></body></html>

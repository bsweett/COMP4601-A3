<meta name="summary" content="Stick to "Aliens""></head><body><p>To be completely fair I did manage to get into the first hour of the movie "Doom" (2005) before the wheels fell off and the mish-mash of a script managed to contradict itself once too many times. And any film that includes close-ups of Rosamund Pike ("Pride and Prejudice" - "Die Another Day") more than justifies its existence and the current $.19 price tag for a used DVD.<br /><br />Pike not only looks good, she is an excellent actress and injects some self-parody into the film, you can almost hear her wondering if her salary was worth having to do scenes with the rest of her talent-challenged ensemble.<br /><br />There isn't a lot of originality to be found here. Basically it is a big budget money-losing attempt to clone "Aliens" while throwing in a few names and inside jokes from the video game. As in "Deep Rising" (another money losing "Aliens" clone) a squad of mercenaries/Marines/Marines go to a luxury liner/space colony/research station and find that the passengers/ colonists/scientists have been wiped out by undersea/deep space/genetically-altered creatures. They attempt to destroy the creatures but most are killed.<br /><br />The hero is a maverick outsider played by Treat Williams/Sigourney Weaver/Karl Urban. The main villain is a slimy businessman/corporation representative/kill-crazy NCO; who endangers everyone. Comic relief is provided by wisecracking Kevin O'Connor/Bill Paxton/Richard Blake. The group encounters a female survivor played by Famke Janssen/Carrie Hein/Rosamund Pike.<br /><br />Unfortunately for "Doom" and "Deep Rising" the producers did not hire the writers from "Aliens". This oversight will have you wondering how they could sink this much money and effort into the making this movie, and put so little thought into writing the screenplay. Too bad really-because while unoriginal, the premise does have a lot of potential. There was simply a failure to execute so that after a promising beginning things bog down completely and it just becomes an exercise in excess; with endless boring battles between mercenaries with pop guns and monsters whose properties allow them to do anything.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</p></body></html>

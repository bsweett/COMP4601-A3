<meta name="summary" content="Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"></head><body><p>I don't expect too much from a retro-sci fi movie that is being hailed mostly for the visual effects, and I like a cinematic movie as much as the next person, but I can only take so many plot holes you can drive a truck through. The world is under attack and there is only one plane to fight them, even though he returns to a base full of them (which again remain on the ground when the base comes under attack, come on, Pearl Harbor was bad, but at least there was more than one plane in the air). In New York, the Sky Captain does a vertical loop to escape his pursuers and then flies down an alley with... a dead end? (I'm reminded of Spock in Star Trek II '[the enemy] does appear to be exhibiting a two dimensional manner of thinking') Polly rides along with Sky Captain through zany twists and turns in New York, confidently giving him directions, then wigs out as he starts a dive. The robots are everywhere (in one room of the mad scientists lair), except when they are conveniently not (in the room next door, they can knock over New York, but not a locked door). Despite a raging battle outside the lair as the hero's fight their way in, once inside they find no one has been alerted to their possible presence. In short, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is nothing special, but good friday night fun.</p></body></html>

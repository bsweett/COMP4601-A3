The soty is good about a man in his 60's who dates younger women about half his age, he then has a heart attack and falls for the women he's dating's mother. The film is great and shows what love really is and shows the reality on life. The last 20 min of the movie is a little slow but other then that it's hallariouse and fun to watch.</p></body></html>

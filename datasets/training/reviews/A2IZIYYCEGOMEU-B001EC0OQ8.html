Bogart's version of the tougher than nails, Sam Spade, is the screen detective that all others were subsequently measured by for decades, and Mary Astor's treacherous widow is sublime. Though the actual violence in this film classic is at a minimum, the threat of it permeates the entire movie.<br /><br />The film quality on this transfer is pretty decent ( though not so on the other two films included ). This is definitely a must for noir lovers, or just film lovers in general.</p></body></html>

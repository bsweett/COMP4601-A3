<meta name="summary" content="Try On The Jacket"></head><body><p>It is 1991, the time of the Gulf War. Adrien Brody plays a soldier who gets shot in the head by a boy and is taken to the hospital.<br /><br /> While at the hospital he is pronouced dead but then somewhat unexplainable happens. Jack Starks (Brody) winks his eyes. Apparently he is alive.<br /><br /> In is now 1993 and we see Starks walking along an empty road. He comes across a younger girl and her mother. Whom at the moment is incapaciated. Their car has broken down and Starks takes it upon himself to help them out. He talks to the girl and finds out their names are Jean and Jackie. Soon the mother wakes up and sees Starks talking to her daughter. She panics, for all she knows this guy could be a child molester. The mother and daughter leave.<br /><br /> And once again Starks finds himself alone on the road. This time he picks up a ride from an unknown person. They drive awhile and a cop stops them. The cop is killed and Starks is arrested.<br /><br /> While on trial Starks in found not guilty due to insanity. He is thought to suffer from illusions.<br /><br /> At the hospital doctors, headed by Kris Kristofferson (Dr. Becker) do test on Starks. They tie him up, put him in a straight-jacket and place him in a morgue. While in there he has visions. After the second or third time he meets Jackie (Keira Knightly) in the future. It is now 2007. There he learns about his own fate and all the people he knows.<br /><br /> That is pretty much the set-up for this John Maybury film, "The Jacket". I suppose when I decsribe the movie to you it sounds interesting but really its not that good of a movie.<br /><br /> I admit I went along with the movie but so many questions are left unanswered. The questions aren't even hinted at. And if you are unable to go along with the movie your enjoyment will be ruined. But what are these questions I felt needed answers? Well, what exactly is this jacket? Who made it? Why is Starks able to see into the future? What do these doctors hope to accomplish? How long has this been going on? Has it ever worked? Do the doctors know these people are able to see into the future or does each person ahve a different reaction? But since the movie does not want to get give us details you have to ask yourself, how much are you willing to accept?<br /><br /> I suppose Brody is good in his role and Knightly as well. But the movie never really allows us to care for these people. If I was interested in the movie it is not because these characters are fascinating, it is because of the action.<br /><br /> You can see a lot of amazon viewers enjoyed the movie, but I don't think it is as good as most are saying. I found "The Jacket" to be poorly written and poorly directed but it is goofy, silly, fun entertainment that can be enjoyed if you remember to shut your brain off.<br /><br /> Bottom-line: Mixed bag entertainment but has its moments. Has an interesting premise don't doesn't fully develope it. Leaves a lot unanswered but either you accept the movie on its terms or you can shut it off.</p></body></html>

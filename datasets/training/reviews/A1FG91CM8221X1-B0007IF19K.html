<meta name="summary" content="Extraordinary performances by Jamie Foxx and others."></head><body><p>Taylor Hackford's "Ray" is an often riveting, wonderfully acted biopic centered by Jamie Foxx's extraordinary turn as a great American original, Ray Charles. To play a public figure who is so idiosyncratic in appearance and manner, and so fresh in the public memory, is the thespian equivalent of taming lions: if you don't get eaten by the role, the performance is considered a success. Foxx not only doesn't get devoured, he saddles up the lion and rides it around the arena. He captures Charles' vocal and physical mannerisms perfectly, but even more, he shows us the complicated, tortured inner life of a man who battled tragedy from his earliest days. This isn't an impression of Charles, but a full-blooded, three-dimensional performance by a master actor. I can think of only one previous performance that compares with it: Kurt Russell's performance as Elvis Presley in John Carpenter's 1979 TV-movie. And Foxx enjoys one enormous advantage over Russell: whereas Carpenter's film was pretty much a whitewash of Elvis, Hackford's portrait of Charles is warts-and-all, allowing Foxx ample access to Charles' dark side. The music is wall-to-wall, as you would expect, and since it's Charles' own singing and playing mimed by Foxx, it's the best. Yet despite the film's length and detail, it feels incomplete and slightly bitter at the end, glossing over Charles' last four decades with a few captions and some brief footage of Charles himself in his later years. We get closure as to one of Charles' major problems (heroin addiction) but not as to others (his compulsive womanizing and often callous treatment of lovers, family and friends). It makes us feel that what the movie doesn't show us must have been REALLY awful! But this deficiency in the movie can't be laid at Foxx's door. Though Foxx is a shoo-in for an Oscar nomination, there are plenty of other Oscar-worthy performances in the film, particularly by the women: Sharon Watkins as Charles' mother; Kerry Washington as his long-suffering wife, Della Bea; and Regina King and Aunjanue Ellis as women who shared a bed as well as a stage with Charles. I must also put in a good word for young C.J. Sanders, who gives a tremendously skillful and touching performance as the seven-year-old Ray.</p></body></html>

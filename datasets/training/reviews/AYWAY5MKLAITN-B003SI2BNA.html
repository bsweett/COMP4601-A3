<meta name="summary" content="Hitchcock must be angry with this movie."></head><body><p>When I first picked up this dvd, I had high expectations. Who wouldn't? The review on the cover loudly proclaims: "Even Hicthcock Could Not have done Better."<br /><br />That's a pretty bold statement when you think about it.<br /><br />I really tried to like this movie.<br /><br />And, on top of that, after watching it, some would say that it's similar to the Ring. What are you talking about? IT'S EXACTLY LIKE THE RING ONLY IT HAS DIFFERENT CHARACTERS.<br /><br />Let's get all the cons about this movie out of the way first:<br /><br />1. 'Dark Water' is not a very original title for a movie of this magnitude.<br />2. All the characters seem bored or uninteresting.<br />3. There were dream sequences that didn't fully contribute to the plot but were more placed there for artistic style pruposes.<br />4. Half of the movie's Theatrical Trailer was an out right lie. A lot of scenes were not even there that got me so pumped up for the movie while watching the trailer. And that is no good at all.<br />5. The screams and shocks were not huge and loud enough.<br />6. Lastly, if you're going to say that Hitchcock couldn't do better, you'd have to really convince me.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1. The drama was well-acted.<br />2. The premise was alright but not mind-bending. In fact, the theme has been done before. But you might like it.<br /><br />Final verdict: Dark Water doesn't scare people that easily.</p></body></html>

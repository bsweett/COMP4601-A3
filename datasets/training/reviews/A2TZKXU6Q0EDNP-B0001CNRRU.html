<meta name="summary" content="A "best of tragedies" with noone at the helm.."></head><body><p>First off, it's becoming rather tiring these days to see that any director aspiring to make an "artsy" film resorts to the non-linear direction. To clear up any misunderstandings in advance, there's nothing wrong per se with using this technique. But there should be a point to it: there should either be a clever twist hiding behind all the back and forths or the choice of going non-linear should make the film more entertaining in an obvious way. But in "21 grams" neither of these objectives is achieved. There is no twist and had this story been told linearly the result (positive or negative) would've been exactly the same.<p>  But  there's actually more working against "21 grams" than for it: throughout the whole film i was left wondering about what the premise is. Is it a film about death? One about god? One about fate, synchronicity and the "chancy" lives we lead? One about the complexity of human emotions? Or is it actually a film about life as lived by humans and the bizzare or "funny" choices they make?<p>  The problem is that it's a bit of everything with other touches thrown in for good measure. This problem becomes more annoying when you consider that all these themes (non exluded) are important and vast enough to make a film on its own for each. If you have 2 hours at your disposal to directorily "comment" on all of them you wind up with a film that says -ultimately- not much but which SEEMS to be saying a lot. But when you try to accurately answer the question "what is the message or the premise" they're conveying at us here you cant come up with a pinpointing answer. <p>  This is basically the equivalent of a film as if it had been made by a trickster. Loads of tricks to impress those only with eyes, but very little for those that employ cerebrum function with eye movement: the non-linear depiction, the fact that a variety of highly unlikely tragedies are thrown together, tied hastingly in a plot that doesn't go in any particular direction and finished off with tons of overacting to compensate for the inadequacy of the plot.<p>  It's not all a bleak sum though. The acting (overacting as it was) is indeed good, because in a perverse way this was the only thing that could've saved this film. Every actor here does his best to elevate this "not much" into "something" and in the end it's the performances that stay with you, not the movie itself.<p>  Speaking of a weak plot i could ask many questions, but I'll ask only one because precisely this question made it a "miss" for me in a definite way: in the film the character of N.Watts finds out that the man she's started an affair with is actually the recipient of her husbands heart. Yet she "marrily" goes on with the affair after only a small tantrum that lasts a mere few hours. Exactly what are the odds of that is what i'd really like to know.. Not only that, but only shortly before, during the funeral of her loved ones she declares that she doesnt want to even press charges against the guy responsible and yet, as a complete and unexplained transformation takes place, she winds up wanting to murder him. Go figure.<p>  To sum it all up, this will easily be a film that'll be widely praised, because people tend to be stunned when they are visually impressed even if there's no premise hidden under the spectacle. It's an old trick in the art of movie-making, it has worked 1000 times before and will work another 1000 times in the future. It's in fact a trick that works in many other levels of life just as effectively. <p>  Knowing that I'm totally going against the tide here with what I've said, i'll say also this: this film tries to be uncharacteristic of Hollywood and yet it manages to be flawed in the way many Hollywood films are: loads of eye-candy but precious little else. Lastly, this trivia about the 21 grams in the end had to do with what exactly anywhere in the film? Oh well, i could go on and on but the point is made. At least i hope so...</p></body></html>

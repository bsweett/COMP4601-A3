<meta name="summary" content="Bad interpretation."></head><body><p>THE INTERPRETER was well-acted and pretty to look at, but the story was incomprehensible and vague. I'm still not entirely sure what the heck happened, to be honest. Sean Penn's character is given a ridiculous backstory. The centerpiece bus scene took about 5 minutes too many to set up. And the ending was a dud.<br /><br />My friend Black and I tried our best to discuss it last night, but there wasn't much to discuss.<br /><br />"Could you figure out what was going on?" Black asked me. "I got lost in it really early, and I still don't know what happened."<br /><br />Though I'm not exactly sure happened in the film, with its one to five assassination plots explained away while the pacing seemed so slow, I am sure it was not as well-done as it could've been. The movie needed more time inside the UN, a more coherent plot and a lot more Catherine Keener.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Adam Sandler Plays More Football (In Jail)"></head><body><p>Adam Sandler plays "Wrecking" Crewe, a retired football player infamous for "shaving points" off a football game many years ago. He's a drunk these days, and in his drunkeness takes off with his rich girlfriend's car, where he ends up in a mad car chase and a colossal crash. He is sentenced to three years jail, in a prison full of wardens and guards who take a little too much pleasure in punishing the prisoners. The guards have a football team, and since Crewe was once a professional football player, they turn to him for advice. Crewe suggests they play a game against a weaker side and beat them to get their confidence up. The guard's agree and get Crewe to make the weaker team, out of the prisoners! Crewe agrees and convinces his cellmates (who he isn't too popular with) to try out. Will they agree to join the team? If they do, will Crewe force them to lose?<br /><br />I remember back in high school, there was this really funny guy in our drama class. He was a fan of Adam Sandler, actually. Anyway, whenever we'd do improvisation, everyone would expect him to do something really funny. He'd end up just going through the motions, kind of a little tired and deadpan. It's kind of how Adam Sandler plays "Wrecking" Crewe. Maybe Mr Sandler's heart wasn't in this film, maybe making all these films are exhausting him, I don't know. His dialogue gives the impression that the character's kind of rebellious, but from Sandler's performance, I didn't exactly know why. Sandler's best acting here is when he has to get himself hyped up, like in the drunken car chase.<br /><br />Chris Rock, who plays the friendly cellmate Caretaker, is his usual chirpy self. The inmates are well cast, and are all interesting enough characters. Though they're criminals, they're likeable, and I ended up wanting to see them win. Being a Adam Sandler film, Rob Schneider makes a cameo, as he always does. Oh dear...<br /><br />I don't know that much about American football, but the football parts of this film were easy enough to follow. The teams strategize, play plays and such, and you don't really need to know what they are, which is good.<br /><br />Three and a half stars, but I'll round up to four. Worth a look for Adam Sandler fans. A little different, not his best, but interesting, even if it is a bit silly at times.</p></body></html>

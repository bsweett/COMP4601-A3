When the movie came out I already heard a lot of the advance publicity but I was still deeply engrossed when I watched it for the first time.  I have seen it many times since although not in its' recent remastered version.  It is a movie that will challenge you in many ways yet it is also a movie that has the potential to reassure you are well.  It is a very well-made movie complete with great writing, acting, directing, and, above all, great special effects.  Even after all of these years, they still are impressive.  <p>This movie is not for the squeemish as I can illustrate with an experience I had in Ensenada, Mexico.  The movie had been out for a year or two and a friend of mine and I were traveling in Baja Mexico.  There wasn't a lot to do at night so, when I saw that the movie was playing at the local theatre, I suggested we go see it.  When my friend said he hadn't seen it before, I insisted that we go.  The theatre was fairly full when we went in.  As the movie got progressively more intense, the show would stop and a warning notice would appear on the screen advising the viewers that the movie was going to become even more graphic.  This screen appeared three times during the movie.  At the end of the show, the lights came on and I was surprized to discover that there were only a handful of people besides my friend and I who had sat through the whole movie.  <p>I don't know that the movie will grip you quite so hard but it may.  There is a strong element of hardcore Christian good versus demonic evil and you can get caught up in this.  The actual history of exorcism is fairly scant given the number of years the scarement has been around and the hundreds of millions of Christians that were or are in this world.  I suspect most people would view this movie more as a test of their nerves rather than their faith.  However, after my experience in Mexico, I thought I should at least put my own warning notice on the screen.</p></body></html>

Edward Norton deserved the Oscar he was nominated for and I would say this is easily his best performance, followed closely by Fight Club and Primal Fear. Edward Furlong, better known as the whiny kid who played John Connor in Terminator 2: Judgement Day, is surprisingly very good here as well. This is one of those movies that I am mad I spent money to rent when I could own this great film for around $10.00. People of all races should see this realistic film dealing with the "stuff" few like to discuss in public, but can still be seen throughout the world.</p></body></html>

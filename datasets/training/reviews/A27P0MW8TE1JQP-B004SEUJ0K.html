The original X-men movie is single-handedly responsible for proving that a decent MARVEL superhero movie could be made, effectively paving the way for SPIDER-MAN, which raised the bar even higher for the genre. In X-MEN: the LAST STAND, the mutants of Xaiver's school are back and growing in number as more comic characters are included in the third installment of the film series. Notable are the additions of KELSEY GRAMMER as the cerebral blue-furred BEAST a.k.a. Dr. Hank Mcoy . The BEAST was one of the 60's comic book original X-Men, along with the winged mutant THE ANGEL, played by Ben Foster (6 Feet Under). Vinnie Jones  is  the unstoppable fighting machine Juggernaut(who does not appear to be related to Prof. X in this incarnation). Other mutants returning for extended appearences are Kitty Pryde a.k.a. SHADOWCAT who can pass thru walls, more of the steel-skinned Colossus, more from the traitorous PYRO. Oscar-winner Anna Paquin returns as ROGUE,struggling with her relations & mutant powers. Shawn Ashmore again plays Bobby Drake a.k.a ICEMAN, throwing comic fans a frosty treat appearing briefly in ice-form. Rebecca Romijn is back in her glorious blue nakedness as the evil Mystique and Aaron Stanford as the disgruntled PYRO. James Marsden returns (briefly) as a grief-stricken Cyclops, even his lost-lady-love returns with Famke Janssen again as Jean Grey and more(read story summary below). Of course, Hugh Jackman returns as Wolverine, Jackman is still a perfect Wolverine. Oscar winner Halle Berry is back as the weather-controlling STORM, who finally flies in this one, sort of an homage to their former director's new project (read on.).<br /><br />Along with all the new mutants, another addition is the director himself, losing Bryan Singer to this summers SUPERMAN RETURNS, X-MEN 3 is directed by BRETT RATNER (RUSH HOUR 1&2) Brett Ratner is still keeping with the recurring theme of mutants still struggling with acceptance, their powers and whether or not they even want those powers.<br /><br />I think the plot is more interesting than the previous two....here's the story (plot spoilers ahead):<br />A  potential "cure" is discovered and processed to treat -- and ultimately eliminate -- genetic mutations, once and for all. . Mutants have a choice: retain their abilities, inspite of it isolating them, or give up their powers becoming human. Prof. X, advocate of tolerance between human and mutantkind, and the leader of the Brotherhood, Magneto, Xavier's fallen-friend who believes that bring mankind to their knees is the only path to peace, finally have the battle we've waited 2 movies to see. The X-Men vs. the brotherhood vs. humankind. They must also face their former teammate, Jean Grey's unleasing the Dark Phoenix, her super-powered alter-ego (I mean "super-powered" like change the script kind of power)danger to the entire planet.<br /><br />This is a good effort, especially with the nortoriously unlucky number "3" following the name. It has a lot of the mutant characters we've been waiting for, it even has the long overdue pairing of Colossus and Wolverine in battle together. As well as more effective use of Wolverine in combat scenes, which the other movies do more sparingly than you mght expect. The music in this one is distractly melodramatic at times thought. Also, stay after the credits for a little treat.</p></body></html>

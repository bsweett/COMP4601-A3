<meta name="summary" content="This Film Was Okay But Definitely The Weakest Of The Series!"></head><body><p>Let me say up front that I am a big fan of the Indiana Jones series. I really wanted to love this film but I couldn't completely! It isn't a bad film but it definitely falls short of the first three.<br /><br />The first hour or so of the movie is probably the best of this film. After that, the plot goes downhill though I have to admit I found myself enjoying the chase through the jungle!<br /><br />The Crystal Skull legend I did find interesting. I hope there is some special about those because I understand they really exist but no one knows how they were made or where they come from. Back to the film, it goes downhill when Marion (Indy's love in the first film) shows up. I don't know why but she just didn't add much to this film this time other than rekindling her romance with Dr. Jones.<br /><br />Shil LeBeuf is okay as Indy's son (a fact not revealed until later in the movie) but I don't know if he's interesting enough to have his own film series. The best thing about this film is actually Harrison himself. His performance as Indiana Jones is still very good. I just wished he would've had a better story!<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this one as a rental or buy at a reduced price. For me, I am waiting until they re-release all of them on blu-ray in one set and get them then! Not a bad film but definitely the weakest of the four.</p></body></html>

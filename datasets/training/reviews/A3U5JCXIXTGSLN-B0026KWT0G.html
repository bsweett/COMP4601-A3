<meta name="summary" content="My Favorite of the Series"></head><body><p>&quot;Friday the 13th Part 3&quot; is my favorite of the entire series. Of course there is the obligatory killing and naked women running around, but I think the best part of this film is the 3-D effects that were used back in the early 80's when 3-D movies were popular. Even though the film technically isn't in 3-D anymore, the gags used to make the 3-D effect are hilarious. The humor alone makes this film worth seeing. I would highly recommend watching this film if you want a scare and a good laugh!</p></body></html>

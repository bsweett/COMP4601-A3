<meta name="summary" content="Fantastic Coming of Age Movie"></head><body><p>Wow!  I loved this movie cuz it avoided the sterotypical pitfall of having the hero be this cutsey nice girl all grown up, but actaully turn into the (b)itch that we all love to hate, in her future life.  And then they turn it around and show it from the perspective of the young girl still being "nice."<br /><br />This angle shows her as she should have been, but living through the mistakes she made as a child and young adult.  What a great learning tool for our young coming of age sisters and daughters.  I love how the "pajama party" is at her house, in the building with all the young girls. That was cute and fun!<br /><br />And the ending was such a cool surpirse, it gave me goose bumps!  I'm not kidding!  I really liked this film.  I think you will too.  Please rent or purchase it from Amazon.com.</p></body></html>

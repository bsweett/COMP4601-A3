Because there he is in his car, peering through his camera lens at an unsuspecting family--he's a stalker!<p>Got to admit, I was hesitant to see "One Hour Photo" at the local theatre because the coming attractions made it seem quite violent. There are scenes of violence eventually, but by far most of the film is very self-contained. This is appropriate because it deals with an isolated man, Williams, who works at a one hour photo lab in a shopping mall. We see his constricted world and his lonely existence; seems sad but not all that unusual. But then there's a pullback and we see that the entire wall of his apartment is covered with extra sets of photos he has made of his favorite family, the Yorkins. He's become obsessed with them and their seemingly idyllic life, and he's about to go over the edge.<p>What finally pushes him over? The discovery of trouble in Yorkin paradise, an adulterous affair. When he sees the photographic evidence of that, he is so outraged that he figures he has to take matters into his own hands, even if he has to balance a chef's knife with his camera in those hands.<p>Kudos to Williams for a remarkable chameleon-like disappearance into the character of Sy the Photo Guy. He looks years older, and acts in a surprisingly understated fashion. But since we all really know that he is larger than life, we always feel that there's going to be an explosion of energy at some point, and  we're not disappointed. Oscar should remember him next year.<p>Take care where you send your photos to be developed next time!</p></body></html>

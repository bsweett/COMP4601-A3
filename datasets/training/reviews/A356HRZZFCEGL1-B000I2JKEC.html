Just about everyone knows about this guy: where he's from, what he can do, what makes him tick.  If somehow you don't know, "Superman: The Movie" will spell it out for you. I guess the best I can do is focus upon how our love and need for "Superheroes" is stronger than our urge to insult them.<br /><br />Of all the things in the world to satirize, you would think superheroes would be among the easiest.  Come on, vain, self-important, overconfident, naive jerks wearing colored underwear running around getting into trouble while fighting bad people and stopping bad things from happening (and all without getting paid)?  What a joke!  And yet, in my opinion, when movie directors take a satirical approach to a superhero movie, they usually turn out an unmemorable, unsuccessful product.  Why?  I think it's because, deep down, we want to believe in and respect superheroes and their admirably unselfish goal to make the world a better place.<br /><br />This is why "Superman: The Movie" (hereafter STM) got it right.  Especially in our cynical times, it is sort of tempting to make merciless fun of a near-perfect demigod who really does care for all people and fights ceaselessly to protect them.  STM does not.  Yeah, it needles some aspects of the Superman mythos (e.g. telephone booths you can't fit into, Clark not even feeling the collision of a taxi that gets damaged, Lex Luthor's elaborate real estate plot, Lex Luthor's inept henchman Otis), but it does so with gentle kidding.  Instead, STM takes the time to introduce Superman from the beginning, from his origins on Krypton to his interactions with the Daily Planet staff and especially his offbeat romance with the flinty, independent Lois Lane.  We learn more about Superman than just the "Super" part - his wonderful powers, abilities, and weaknesses.  We learn about the "man" part too - his values, his objectives, his hopes, his fears,and his kind, courageous heart.<br /><br />Superman has been called the "Man of Steel", but he has also been called "The Man of Tomorrow", because he sets a standard to which all people can aspire and into which we can all evolve if we follow our better natures.  I think STM acknowledges this, and hints that all the action, special effects, adventure, and battles of any superhero movie are meaningless unless we respect and believe in the "S" - not just Superman, but also the "S" we all potentially have underneath.</p></body></html>

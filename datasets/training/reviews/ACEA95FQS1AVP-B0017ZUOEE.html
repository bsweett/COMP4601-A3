And this movie is one of the best I've seen - better than " The Sixth Sense", or "The Others".  I heard about Guillermo del Toro when he did the first Hellboy.  I became a fan after seeing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000O76ZQC">Pan's Labyrinth</a>.  Del Toro has a real gift for building tension - this film is creepy, jump in your skin suspenseful and though I guessed where the plot was going, the ending still had a good twist.  Even more, the ending was near perfect and tied all the bits together without blatantly answering one question - are the ghosts real?<br /><br />Laura was raised in an orphanage.  Years later she returns there with her husband and son to open a home for ill children.  The day the children arrive, Laura is attacked by a child with a burlap sack mask and her son Simon disappears.  The police are called in, a massive search is conducted but he's not found.  At this point, strange things begin to happen in the house.  Banging sounds, flashes of visions.  Laura suspects Simon has been kidnapped by ghosts and calls in a medium.  Her physician husband obviously fears for her sanity.  Yet, the audience is never certain if these are the actions of a desperate mother, or a woman who's truly being haunted.  There is a lot of emotion in the story, giving the film a surprising depth.  The acting is superb, and rarely over the top.  Music is used almost sparingly - never actually creating the suspense, only enhancing it.  I thought this was especially good filmmaking as too often the music gives away that something is about to happen.  One of the best scenes in the movie is when Laura turns her back on a dark room playing a counting game - the first time she turns around, ghostly forms of children appear across the room.  Each time she counts and turns around, they have moved closer.  It was so creepy my skin crawled!  Overall, a stunning movie that I will definitely watch again.<br /><br />The DVD has a few featurettes, the best of which is the making of, "When Laura Grew Up" which includes interviews with the cast and filmmakers.  I think this movie would have exploded at the box office had it been in English - which is a shame.  I do regret that the DVD has no dubbed track.  I noticed many reviewers complained about this, and were sniped at by fans of the film.  That's a little unfair.  I have family members who can't read subtitles fast enough to keep pace with a film.  If they are reading the subtitles, they miss what the characters are doing on screen.  I don't mind subtitles as I understand that something can be lost from the original language, and I read fast enough.  But many people missed out on an excellent film because they can't read fast enough - especially for a movie with twists, and little clues taking place on screen so frequently.  Those who can follow subtitles could still enjoy the movie as intended, but a dub track would expand the audience a little more.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="not what i expected"></head><body><p>well,for 2009,it was between this movie,the t4 and watchmen for movie of the year and this one lost.i liked it.dont get me wrong.its just that there were a bunch of errors.i guess i should expect that since not one comic book movie has been accurate yet.<br />  most of this movie was in the x-men trilogy.so all the answers were taken care of already.sabretooth was actualy wolverines dad.im pretty sure the xmen were the original mutant team.wolverine was dropped with one bullet in xmen 2 but absorbs hundreds in the first few minutes of this film.this dead pool guy showed up much later i thought too.<br />  these facts aside,the movie was pretty cool.the opening fight scenes were memorable.how old wolverine is ,is staggering.the action is cool.dead pool is awesome.there are a few lesser known mutants all through it in the later parts.<br />  this movie rocked!id give it second place for 2009 behind the watchmen and slightly above terminator salvation.</p></body></html>

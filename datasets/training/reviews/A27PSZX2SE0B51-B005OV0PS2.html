<meta name="summary" content="The Dude abides"></head><body><p>I first saw "The Big Lebowski" when it was in the theatres.  Being a die-hard Coens fan, I was ready for inconsequential lunacy, esoteric characterizations, and dangerous obsessions with style and substance.  Which is what I got.  Still, I couldn't help feeling a bit disappointed.  Having revisited "Lebowski" recently, I now understand why.  Ill prepared to deal with the rambling narrative, I felt cheated by lack of structure.  Which, I now see, is precisely the point of the film.  So, my advice to first time viewers of "The Big Lebowski": never mind the plot machinations, this one's all about watching (and listening to [and learning from]) The Dude.<p>Remember that stoner guy in high school, the one with the flashes of wit and insight in between spaced-out ramblings about his favourite rock band?  Well, then you are on your way to knowing Jeffrey "The Dude" Lebowski.  Mistaken by collecting thugs for a richer, more married, other Jeffrey Lebowski, The Dude gets caught up in a kidnapping caper when all he really wants to do is bowl and own a urine-free rug that really holds the room together.  His dialogue belies years of smoking jay and downing endless White Russians.  But The Dude is no Spicoli retread, and he'd never be caught dead with Bill and Ted.  Surprisingly, he's a man of substance.<p>His history, missed by me the first time around, plays a terribly important role in his character.  There's the scene where he's in bed with Maude Lebowski (daughter of The Big Lebowski), where she point blank asks him about his past.  Obscure references are made to the Port Huron Statement and the Seattle Seven, which indicates a fair measure of radicalism in Jeff's student days.  But he also casually tells Brandt (The Big Lebowski's manservant) that his university days were spent, "occupying various, um, administration buildings, smoking thai-stick [and] breaking into the ROTC".  So a social conscience was never far from young Jeff's thoughts.  But now, some two decades later, he's burned out.  It's the yearning for the casual lifestyle, free from stress and, quite frankly, thought, that is the main theme at the core of the movie.<p>Standing in The Dude's way are a series of supporting characters that make up a Raymond Chandleresque menagerie of society's oddest oddballs (a group of nihilists with a defined sense of fairness; a trust-fund performance artist; an old-school pornographer; a bowling child molester; a seemingly endless parade of carpet pissers).  But they are less characters than roadblocks to The Dude's ultimate goal: a life of leisure.<p>Jeff Bridges, so adept at playing tormented angst ("The Fabulous Baker Boys", "The Fisher King"), proves that he has a deft comic touch, without ever being light.  His Dude is a scruffy sloth, impatient with the world around him, but unable to figure out a viable way out of it.  Bridges is truly hilarious here, never more so than with a simple expression near the end, when one character literally gets in his face.  Assisting Bridges on his quest for leisure nirvana are John Goodman and Steve Buscemi.  Goodman's Walter Sobchak is, if possible, even more over the top than The Dude.  A conspiracy minded Vietnam vet, Sobchak is the raving id to The Dude's laid-back id, which makes them fast friends, and a terrible team.  Buscemi, in what may be the most thankless role in the entire Coen canon, brings enough humanity to the eternally dim Donny that he becomes less a cipher and more an important friend.  The rest of the cast is a fine mixture of Coen regulars, recognizable character actors, and even a couple of my favourite musicians in small cameos (look closely for Flea and Aimee Mann as two of the Nihilists).<p>But it's probably Sam Elliott who makes the most undeniable impression here, as a smooth talking cowboy enigmatically called "The Stranger".  His thick southern drawl, bushy moustache, and constantly twinkling eyes brighten up the few brief scenes he's in.  Ostensibly the narrator (and who else but the Coens could dream up a narrator who loses his train of thought?), Elliott appears once at the beginning, once in the middle, and once again at the end.  He offers low-key charm for The Dude to play off of (one of my favourite jokes in the film:<p>THE STRANGER: One of those days, huh?  Well, a wiser fellow than myself once said, sometimes you eat the bar and sometimes the bar, well, he eats you.<p>DUDE:  Uh-huh.  That some kind of Eastern thing?  [Mike's note:  Oh yeah!  The whole Eastern philosophy thing is a great, subtle undercurrent throughout the film.  The Dude abides, indeed.  Catch him doing faux Tai Chi when he needs to mellow out more than the marijuana can handle.]<p>THE STRANGER:  Far from it.).<p>Ultimately, I suppose, "Lebowski" is a product of the Coen Brothers' minds, and its laced with their particular obsessions, stylistic devices, and eclectic musical choices (imagine scoring a tense bowling moment with a flamenco version of "Hotel California").  If you've enjoyed the Coens' anti-filmmaking in the past, and are prepared for an even more extreme example of it, take a quick trip with The Dude and Co.  You'll surely enjoy the ride.<p>(The DVD doesn't have much in the way of features, except for a nifty 30-minute interview with Joel and Ethan Coen.  It's a rare treat, offering a trip into the brothers' witty, eccentric, but thoughtful filmmaking minds.  Their anecdote about an interview they gave to a magazine called "Floor Coverings Weekly" is priceless, and it shows their playfulness and willingness to mock anyone not in on the joke.)</p></body></html>

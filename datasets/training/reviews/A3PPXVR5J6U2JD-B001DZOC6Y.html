<meta name="summary" content="Wait...What Happening?"></head><body><p>There's a lot wrong with The Happening.<br /><br />At base, The Happening is a nightmarish parable about our crowded society in modern times.  We threaten the world, director M. Night Shyamalan seems to say, with our sheer numbers.  On the other hand, being completely isolated isn't the solution either, creating a suspicious, isolationist attitude that leads to a self-destructive spiral.<br /><br />But The Happening is mostly about watching people commit suicide in terrible ways.  This ranges from terrible echoes of 9/11, when workmen jump from a building to their death, to the cartoonishly absurd, when a zookeeper taunts a lion and it tears his arm off.  Anyone who watches the Discovery Channel or Animal Planet knows that big cats go for the neck first.<br /><br />Anyway, The Happening's premise is spooky: what if something in the wind made people commit suicide in the most immediate and awful way possible?  Where would you go?  What would you do?<br /><br />Night has all the elements of a good horror story: the aforementioned disaster, the strained relationship between Elliott Moore (Mark Wahlberg) and his distant wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel), and even an innocent little girl (Ashlyn Sanchez) thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />The Happening should be a great horror film.  It's spooky.  The premise that a gust of wind could bring about a fatal, nightmarish end lends an ominous shadow to the events. We can expect plenty of drama, morally ambiguous choices, and desperate survival tactics as our protagonists flee for their lives from an alien foe.<br /><br />Actually, I was just describing Spielberg's War of the Worlds, which took the same premise and made a creepy, nuanced film about parents, children, and the distance between them. The two films have a lot in common: the insidious enemy that pops up out of nowhere, the little girl in distress, the long journey against all odds to a haven that might already have been destroyed.<br /><br />The Happening follows the same script but fails miserably on almost all counts. Oh, Night's got the scary part down.  But what carries a film like this is the emotional heft of characters brought to the brink.  Wahlberg does a workman-like job of trying to be clever and sarcastic, but the script forces him to spew mouthfuls of pseudo-scientific gobbledygook at a rapid fire pace that he can't keep up.  Deschanel, never a strong actress to begin with, is comedically awful.  There isn't the slightest romantic tension between her and Wahlberg.  And the little girl?  She barely says a word.<br /><br />The list of what's wrong goes on and on: citizens leave New York in an orderly fashion without snarling any mass transit; victims go to inordinate and improbable lengths to kill themselves; a father abandons his only child in a vain quest to find his wife; nobody seems to think traveling with a gas mask might be a good idea except two old ladies sitting at home.<br /><br />They're the smart ones.</p></body></html>

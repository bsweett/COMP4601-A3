<meta name="summary" content="Intriguing Speculation About J.F. Kennedy Assassination"></head><body><p>For most of his career as writer/director, Oliver Stone has associated himself with controversial movies.  None provoked discussion more than "JFK," now available in an Ultimate Collector's Edition from Warner Home Video.  This powerful film about the mysteries surrounding the Kennedy assassination was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actor (Tommy Lee Jones).  The all-star cast includes Kevin Costner, Kevin Bacon, Gary Oldman, Jack Lemmon, Sissy Spacek, Joe Pesci, John Candy, Walter Matthau, Donald Sutherland, and Ed Asner.  The three-disc set includes 17 minutes not seen in theatres, the documentary "Beyond JFK: The Question of Conspiracy," deleted scenes, five reproduction letters written by or to John F. Kennedy, a set of six character photo cards with the stars and bios of the real people they portray, and a 44-page book of rare behind-the-scenes production photos.</p></body></html>

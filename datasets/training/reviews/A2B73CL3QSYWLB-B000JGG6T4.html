<meta name="summary" content="Slick Revenge Thriller"></head><body><p>Thirty some years ago the films "Dirty Harry" and "Death Wish" were released to the public causing debate about the films' advocating maverick policemen and vigilanteism.  Now comes "Man on Fire", a film that received less fanfare but generally dismissed by the critics for it's brutality.  This film is enigmatic because it prescribes to the serious issue of kidnapping in Latin America that the solution is brutal vigilanteism.  On the flip side, this film is so well crafted and entertaining that ultimately you just dimiss such concerns and say it's only a movie.  Director Tony Scott surehandedly directs this film from a script by Brian Helgeland("L.A. Confidential").  The film's best moments come at the beginning as the relationship unfolds between ex-CIA [...] John Creasy(Denzel Wasington) and the child he his hired to guard, Pita Sanchez(Dakota Fanning).  Washington also does a good job at showing a man whose demons are enveloping him.  It's in the film's second half when Creasy ferrets out the child's kidnappers that you take pause.  It's the methods that border on the sadistic that make you jump back.  But the film does overcome these excesses through the strength of the story and the acting.  There is a strong supporting cast here with Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke, and Giancarlo Giannini.  I would like to note especially the fine work of Radha Mitchell who plays the girl's mother.  She can be seen in fine form as J.M. Barrie's wife in the recently released "Finding Neverland".</p></body></html>

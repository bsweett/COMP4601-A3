<meta name="summary" content="Jackson and Affleck give solid and powerful performances!"></head><body><p>"Changing Lanes" is a film that is nothing short of being brilliant! The direction of Roger Michell ("Notting Hill") is outstanding! And the top-notch performances from Samuel L. Jackson ("Shaft") and Ben Affleck ("The Sum of All Fears") were played with perfection all the way! The film centers around two men: The first man is Doyle Gipson (Jackson), a recovering alcoholic who tries to pick up the pieces of his once happy marriage and tries to provide for his family by buying a house for them. The other man is Gavin Banek (Affleck), an ambitious high-powered attorney involved in a shady deal with his business partners who are biking a charity. Doyle Gipson and Gavin Banek had no reason to meet...until that fateful day on the freeway. The two men are in a rush to get to their court appointments when a fender bender puts them behind schedule. Banek's rushed handling of the situation, including leaving the scene of the accident saying the words "Better luck next time!", has resulted in Gipson not only being late for his court appointment, but he also lost custody of his kids and it looks like he might not see them again. As for Banek, well, not only is he also late for court, he has also lost a very important file of his...at the scene of the accident...with Doyle Gipson! And not only does this mean that Banek has lost the file, it could also cost him his job and his freedom as well! So what started out as a simple fender bender on the freeway became a conflict between two different men...each with two different agendas...and one with a very important file that the other wants back as soon as possible. And the film goes on from there. "Changing Lanes" is a contemporary American thriller that will keep you on the edge of the seat from start to unforgettable finish! With two of the biggest stars today, a great supporting cast (Toni Collette, William Hurt, Amanda Peet, Sydney Pollack, Richard Jenkins, Kim Staunton), and powerful storytelling, "Changing Lanes" is a must-see for DVD!</p></body></html>

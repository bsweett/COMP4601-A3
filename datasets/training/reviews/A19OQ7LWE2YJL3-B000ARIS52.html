<meta name="summary" content="Another flick for the adult little boys..."></head><body><p>Nudity in the first 10 minutes.  Plenty of killing, blood, torture, and miscellaneous violence.  All the female actors are hot, buff and under 30 (and many naked).  The male actors range from Rutger Hauer, Powers Boothe, Mickey Rourke, & Bruce Willis to youngster in the Charlie Brown sweater, Elijah Wood.<br /><br />Definitely one of those movies for the boys that they'll all run out and add to their little DVD collections right alongside  Star Wars, LOTR Trilogy, Constantine, Matrix, The Professional, Ronin, etc.<br /><br />The "Marv" character and storyline was the only reason I gave the movie 3 stars.</p></body></html>

Welcome to the Desert of the Real!"></head><body><p>We know from our indoctrination into the philosophy of the Matrix movies that there are two worlds: one is the waking dream that is the "Matrix", a world generated by the Machines to keep us shackled in illusion while we're used as living batteries. Tne second world is that of the Desert of the Real: you have no job. You have no cubicle. You have no rent-controlled apartment with a nosy landlord.<br /><br />Everything you see before you, all the "evidence" of your senses, is an ambitious fraud: you are kept in a cocoon, envatted in a snare of pink fluid and dreams, convinced you live and walk and talk and breathe the air of a free man in a free society.<br /><br />In other words: the Real, and the Illusory. The Wachowski Brothers have made a great flick technically (ie: the realm of the illusory): they have stormed the ramparts of what great cinema should look like, and---who knows?---stormed the ramparts of how movies should be made.<br /><br />They have also churned out a flick that betrays the rich ideas of the first film. In the same spirit, and because it is unfair to "Matrix Revolutions" to judge it according to either its technical flair or its philosophical limitations, I shall provide a rare dual review, also in keeping with the dual realities of the Matrix.<br /><br />MATRIX REVIEW(The World of Illusion): 5 stars out of 5. My God this movie looks great! This flick cost 150 million smackers to make, and every penny---every red cent---of that budget is up on the screen! Look at the dual, perhaps triplicate, realities the Wachowskis have conjured up: the slick, techno, ephemeral, ghost-green world of the Matrix, green-hued, lorded over by the fast-talking Merovingian, the consummate Rabbit hole-within-Rabbit-hole. So gorgeous it makes you wish you'd taken the Blue Pill. Maybe there's still time?<br /><br />Anyway, the flick looks amazing. Even if you're disgusted with it, pop it back into the hopper, and look at the thing! Look at the ropy steel-and-red-burning-laser-eye contraptions of the Sentinels, or the gigantic drill that burrows through the rooftop to Zion and then plummets to the floor of the cavern below! This is simply one of the greatest, most hyper-kinetic action flicks ever filmed; the fear in the Great Hall when the battle mechas confront the swarming sentinel reeks of war and sweat and death and fear. I love it!<br /><br />Classic. The fight between Neo and Agent Smith (the great Hugo Weaving in his generation-defining, massively quoted role) is one for the ages: the rain, the generic cityscape, the rows and rows and rows of Agent Smiths watching from the streets, from the windows of the otherwise vacant office buildings. Brrrr.<br /><br />ZION REVIEW(The Desert of the Real): 1 out of 5 Stars. Blah! Desert of the Real is right: great characters from "The Matrix" go through the motions: Neo (Keanu Reeves)sleepwalks through his role, Morpheus (Larry Fishburne) looks like he's about ready to call out for a pizza---someone should have budgeted for Fishburne a personal trainer, or at the least put the big guy on the Atkins diet.<br /><br />Trinity (the nimble Carrie Anne Moss) provides earnest eye candy. Neo (Keanu Reeves) does his Neo-thang. Nothing is resolved. Heretical yet intriguing theories provoked by "Matrix Reloaded" (the "Matrix-within-a-Matrix" theory suggested by Neo's ability to stop the sentinels in the "real" world) are nodded to and then ignored. Yes, the trailer promised us great things---"It all ends tonight"---but we get zero delivery. The huge questions---does any of this matter? Is Zion Real?---are ignored.<br /><br />Alright. Real World: 1 Star. Matrix World: (all the CGI goodies and cinematic wizardry): 5 Stars. Listen to Hugo Weaving's dialogue; Weaving, as Agent Smith/Bane, completely owns this movie and gives it its black wicked heart. Bully to him! Sample the raw sheer audacious techno style of the Merovingian (the incomparable Lambert Wilson), who found French to be the superlative language of the Insult.<br /><br />Ogle Monica Belluci (the luscious Persephone), who just looks ripe. Wonder how Harvard law prof and Ivy League resident crackpot ever bribed the Wachowskis to be in this movie. Just don't expect any answers, deep meaning, or conclusions. What, you thought you'd find the meaning of Life in a blockbuster flick? Sheesh.<br /><br />It's stylish, it's wicked black, it bumps and grinds, it's pretty cool. Ultimately it answers none of the questions. Do you care? Take the Blue Pill! Take the Red Pill! You'll find that with "Matrix Revolutions" it makes no difference.<br /><br />JSG</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A parable about our current relationship to Islam."></head><body><p>This is a very entertaining DVD, full of action with very well constructed and filmed battle scenes of great scope. In some ways the film is very timely considering that there is a tension between the current Western civilization of America and Europe and the Islamic world that stretches across Asia. I found it interesting that the film depicts those Christians who are tolerant of a multicultural and diverse nation with those Christians that are not tolerant of other's religious beliefs. In this film, Balian (played by Orlando Bloom), his father, and the king of Jerusalem ( a pitiful leper hiding behind a silver mask) represent those forces that can live with diversity of spiritual beliefs.  The Templar Knights represent those forces that can not live with diversity and multiculturalism for it threatens them. In this film, the Muslims are a powerful military force that also is diverse in tolerance or non-tolerance for Christians. It is a beautiful film, with fascinating architecture, set construction, and weapon and costume design. The battle for the city of Jerusalem is exciting, a dramatic high point, and a critical aspect of the film. Saladin wins the battle and Jerusalem is handed over to the Muslims. Remember that after the death of Jesus, the apostles and disciples spread Christianity into Egypt and Ethiopia, into Rome, France, Spain, England, and Ireland. Also Christianity was spread into Eastern Europe such as Romania, Hungary, Germany. Christianity was spread into present day Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and Iran. Thus the sweep of Islam across the world in around the year 600 brought Islam to Christian communities and cities across the Middle East. It is in response to this growing Islamic power and dominance over the Middle East for 700 years that the Crusades were waged - which is a primary theme of the film. Yet this is not a Christians hate Muslims who in turn hate Christians type of film. Instead the writers and film-makers imply that the Kingdom of Heaven is attainable here on earth through the belief in tolerance for other's beliefs about God. This is actually a good message for our day and time - which director Ridley Scott obviously knows.</p></body></html>

They tell him their village was ravaged, and while the others listen and simply move on to the village resuming their lives, the encounter with these people haunts Jaguar Paw.<br /><br />Rightfully so, as a mere day later, the same people come and ravage his village. They attack the men, kill those who resist, and enslave all save the children, who they simply leave behind to follow their parents in tears until they cannot follow any longer.<br /><br />Along the way, a diseased young girl tells of a prophecy, in which a man of the Jaguar will bring about the doom of those slavers who listen to her, and all sorts of other omens such as "He who runs with the Jaguar".<br /><br />Enslaved, they are taken to a great city made of stone, where one by one the women are sold into slavery, and the men are taken to the top of a great temple to be sacrificed to the Gods, as these people fear that their Gods are displeased, and their end approaches.<br /><br />Just as Jaguar Paw is to be sacrificed, a solar eclipse takes place which the High Priest interprets as the Gods' satisfaction, and lets Jaguar Paw live.<br /><br />The slavers then take the remaining captives to an empty arena-like field, and release the captives two at a time, telling them to try to run away into the forests, while they shoot at them from behind with slings, arrows, and javelin, and with the son of the Chief acting as "Finisher" to kill the men as they attempt to crawl away, dying from their wounds.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw is shot through the side by an arrow, and just as he is to be killed, his friend (who had been shot down earlier) attacks the Chief's son, and Jaguar Paw is able to break off the arrowhead and kill him with it, before running off into the jungle. The chief and his men chase him.<br /><br />They chase Jaguar Paw all throughout the jungles, and as they do, all of the diseased girl's prophecies come true. Jaguar Paw is being chased by a Jaguar whose cub he accidentally encountered and disrupted, and as one of the men catches up to Jaguar Paw, he is attacked and killed by the cat.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw is running back to his village, as he has left his wife and child inside a deep stony cave in the ground to save them as the villagers are enslaved.<br /><br />One by one, he devises traps and weapons to kill his enemies, before he can rescue his wife. It begins to rain, and the hole is filling with water.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw kills all but two of the men, but is saved when he flees to the beach, and the two pursuers are frozen in their places, astonished at the sight of men in gigantic ships approaching the beach.<br /><br />Jaguar Paw is able to flee and rescue his wife and child, where they retreat into the forest to find a new beginning...<br /><br />The plight of Jaguar Paw was very deeply human, and the acting was richly superb with light, but not sparse dialogue, and a gamut of emotions being run through all the characters, whose facial expressions and cries of anguish, pain, joy, or pleasure tell more than any amount of dialogue ever could. Along with the beautifully realistic jungle setting and cinematography, this is simply put, a masterpiece.<br /><br />It wasn't until recently that I became aware of the historical inaccuracies abound in this film, but this doesn't at all detract from the impact of this film.  After all, it's a personal story of one man's struggle to save his family.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Nice to see Indy again...but the ending...? What the...???"></head><body><p>I vividly recall seeing the original Raiders on opening night back in 1980 not realizing what a phenomenon it would become. It became a tradition for me to see each of the sequels opening day as well--and when I discovered that Crystal Skull was actually IN production, I remember thinking to myself, "I'm going to LOVE this movie no matter WHAT."<br /><br />Unfortunately, reality has a way of making me swallow my words--but I discovered crow ain't so bad once you get past the feathers...the film, on the other hand, left a LOT to be desired. Now first, let me say that aside from the ending, I really enjoyed this movie a LOT. My initial reaction to seeing Harrison all decked out as Indy was a bit of a shock as I thought, "Holy CRAP he looks old!" But I got over that rather quickly as I became enveloped in the story.<br /><br />I don't CARE how believable the story is, as long as it stays within the Indy-frame of reference of what has gone before and manages to entertain me. For the vast majority of the movie I honestly was on the edge of my seat (as were my 6 & 4 year old sons who count this one of the greatest examples of movie-making in history...). I believe, and I think that I am NOT alone in this, that when it comes to the supernatural that we have come to expect from the Indiana Jones franchise, the success or failure of these movies relies heavily upon the phrase, "Less Is More". HINTING that aliens exist is one thing, it is another to just force it down our throats. Again, other than the outlandish ending which was about as far from what we have come to expect from the three previous films as you can get, I seriously enjoyed Crystal Skull a LOT.<br /><br />The inclusion of Marion was nothing short of genius if you ask me. It was unfortunate that Sean Connery couldn't be convinced to give Henry Jones Sr. another try, but despite that, the story was thoroughly engaging all the same. The atomic blast at the beginning was stretching it by quite a bit, but I found myself entertained even so. Was it even remotely believable? Of course not, but then again, does anyone really believe the Ark opening scene from Raiders could really happen...? Didn't think so. It's a MOVIE for heavens sake--and yet as I realized that hinting at aliens was not going to be enough for George Lucas this time around, I had a feeling that something was going to go terribly wrong. I was right.<br /><br />I also realize that I am not necessarily in the majority here as MANY Indy fans actually LOVED the ending, some of which were rather surprised at how it all unfolded. I felt that it was telegraphed early on, so it wasn't that much of a surprise for me...all the while I was hoping that it wouldn't happen as I feared it would--and DID.<br /><br />In short, 97% of the movie was awesome...the last 5 minutes left a sour taste in my mouth if for NO other reason than I felt that leaving us wondering more about the so-called alien connection would have been much more in keeping with the history of Indiana Jones rather than the bold approach of pulling back the curtain and showing it to us in vivid color. Am I wrong? I guess that depends on your opinion, and as I like to remind everyone: opinions vary. I suppose that the last few minutes bothered me enough to revoke two stars from my review, even though up to that point I was really having a great time.</p></body></html>

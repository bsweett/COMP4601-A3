<meta name="summary" content="Absolutely brilliant superhero movie. One of the best!"></head><body><p>Hellboy is the movie based on the comic book that I hadn't even ever heard about. Well anyway, if the comic's half as good as this, it will be good! This is a very good superhero movie about Hellboy. He's big, red, has a big tail and a big gun. He's bigger, badder, and stronger than the other red superhero guy, your friendly neighborhood spiderman. Well ,anyway, in this movie, he's got to fight evil and stop world domination from a bunch of nutcases. One vilain particualrily cool has some big blades that come out from his hands. Hellboy also has to fight some crazy weird looking monsters alongside an FBI agent who's trying to steal his girl.<br /><br />What makes this movie work is the great action and the hilarious humor. Ron Perlman's great as Hellboy and has some good one liners. This one didn't even look that good to me, but for a superhero movie, this one's great.</p></body></html>

Some people call it witty,funny, etc.. *YAWN*..Its not very interesting and the whole plot is pretty silly. Teenagers talk like this? Really?? Not any that I know; grunting maybe..<br /><br />  One reviewer called it "an irresponsible movie", I tend to agree. Getting pregnant in high school used to be a bad thing - not anymore. Now rich white people looking to adopt will run to your door if you get stuck with a baby at 16; well, if you have a white, healthy baby (They ARE worth lots of $$$)..<br /><br />  Juno is a whole lotta sizzle and no steak. Its not a horrible movie, but its not worthy of all the hype.</p></body></html>

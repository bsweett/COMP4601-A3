In the same manner that Lord of the Rings incorporated New Zealand's stunning landscape into the storyline, "Motorcycle Diaries" tells a very honest tale of two adventure seekers who ride through South America on a motorbike and are inspired by its breathtaking landscape and the interesting lives of the people they encounter.  It's all a true story and it's the road trip that inspired Ernesto "Che" Guevara to become a revolutionary.<br /><br />Regardless of your viewpoints of Che Guevara, this movie modestly and humorously brings about the sense of adventure and humanity of Granado and Guevara on their trip.  Two young men, a medical student and a biochemist are looking to practice medicine and get laid on the way, but of course everything changes after 8 months on the road.  Nonetheless, it's a wonderful journey.  No overdramatization in this movie.  No cliched speeches.  It's simply a well-told coming of age story.  Gael Garcia Bernal asolutely nails the role.  He's fast on his way to an Oscar.<br /><br />Highly recommended movie and not to be missed.</p></body></html>

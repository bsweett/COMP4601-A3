<meta name="summary" content="My fave of the 3!"></head><body><p>It's very unusual that I would like a third in the series the best, but I really do! I love the opening amusement park setting, I can always get the creeps there and so many bad things that can happen in one, it makes perfect sense to start a thiller in one. The funny the is, the characters are the least likable ones, not on in the FD series, but in almost any movie. They were just really broad stereotypes of some diffrent teens about to graduate. You know, snotty girls, jocks, emos, etc. I swear you almost cheer for them to get killed, and wow do they get killed in cool and new ways! I really loved the ending, it's how it should be considering the first 2 movies. I also like the interactive features, and some of the stuff on the other disk. If you like these movies for the orignal death scenes, not character development, you'll enjoy this entry.</p></body></html>

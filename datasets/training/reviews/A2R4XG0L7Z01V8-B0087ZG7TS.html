<meta name="summary" content="Could not get into the book"></head><body><p>After seeing the movie, I do fancy giving the book another go. But I definitely couldn't get my head around it the first time around.<br /><br />Why did I buy Atonement? I was actually curious about this movie. People rave about it, crying when they came out of the cinema etc. People saying it was only made to win awards. All these five star reviews. Which normally means I won't like the film.<br /><br />Although I was quite confused during the first half hour, as it flips between one person's viewpoint to another, but I soon got dragged into the movie. The cast do brilliantly in their roles, although I don't think I'm ever going to be a fan of James McAvoy. He's just not one of my favourite actors.<br /><br />I won't go into the whole story, as so many other reviewers have already done so. But while I'll agree that yes, the film has been made to win awards, it is a really good film. I didn't, however, cry after watching it. I was more shocked when the credits were rolling. The only bit I didn't like in the movie was the much celebrated tracking shot through Dunkirk. Why is it so special? I got bored when it was on screen, there was nothing special there. In my opinion, it was an overly long shot, which didn't fit in with the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Prepared to be shocked and surprised with this movie, as it takes you in a direction that I certainly didn't think it would. And I actually liked Keira Knightley for once. (I don't normally.) Although she's still far too skinny, but she'll never change. James McAvoy - I've seen him in a couple of films now - most recently Wanted - and I still don't like him. My personal opinion, other people start swooning when his name is mentioned, just not for me.<br /><br />Watching Atonement has made me want to re-try the book again. And definitely watch the film again, to see if I can spot the little 'clues' that there's supposed to be throughout. But an excellent movie, and one I did not think I would like.</p></body></html>

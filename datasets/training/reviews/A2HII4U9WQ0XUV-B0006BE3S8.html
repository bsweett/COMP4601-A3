<meta name="summary" content=""Alien and Predator, sitting in a tree! K I S S...I N G!!!""></head><body><p>"First comes LOVE---then comes MARRIAGE---and then the Pred-Alien in a BABY carriage!!!"<br /><br />Sorry, I couldn't help myself. And oddly enough, the old schoolyard taunt is strangely appropriate, as you'll soon see.<br /><br />Look: I wanted to see "Alien versus Predator" for one reason.<br /><br />I didn't want to see lovingly detailed human characters working through their conflicts and solving problems together.<br /><br />I didn't want to see a banal, sappy, feminist hero (Sanaa Lathan, a usually decent actress who did what she had to do as the awful Lex) spend some quality bonding time with a Junior Predator Hunter.<br /><br />All I wanted---and all I suspect you wanted---was a total interstellar smackdown between the Galaxy's two most-wanted Xenomorphs: H.R. Geiger's Alien and the 2nd-Amendment loving intergalactic hunter Predator.<br /><br />In short, I wanted killing, deep space style.<br /><br />Did I get it?  Yes and No.  But let's dig right into the guts of this interstellar pot-boiler. Tycoon industrialist Charles Bishop Weyland (the great and nearly immortal Lance Henriksen, who is too cool for school in this outing) founder of the Weyland-Yutani corporation that figures so heavily in the "Alien" series, has reports of bizarre heat signals emanating from Antarctica. Being a rich, paranoid, somewhat delusional, completely obessive guy, he rounds up a team of scientists to go figure out what's going on.<br /><br />What's going on? You probably know: it's the smackdown of the millennia---the intergalactic space cockroach Alien versus the gun-totin' kill-it-n-grill-it Predator. Fun times!<br /><br />Right? Well, sort of.<br /><br />At its best, Paul W.S. Anderson's "Alien versus Predator" backs off and gives us what we want. We get a total ultimate whup-a** thrashing session between an Alien drone and a uber-confident Predator. We get slicing. We get dicing. The Aliens have never looked so sleek, so deadly, so menacing. The Predators are super-sized: bigger blades, sleeker weapons, hipper masks. Give Anderson's Special Effects team kudos for this (headed up by Roland Blancaflor, who has done every single sci-fi special effects gig ever---you doubt me?---try "Blade:Trinity", "Wild Wild West", "Planet of the Apes" (Burton version), "Titanic" and so on. The rest of the special effects team have equally awesome resumes. Look, stuff looks good here.<br /><br />Yes, the characters, and the characterizations, are awful. I prayed for all of them to die horribly---with the exception of project financier Charles Bishop Weyland (Henriksen), who brings a nice smoldering chunk of cool to the proceedings. Yes, Alexa is meant to be the heroine. And yes, I wanted her to die brutally, humiliatingly, and miserably from the moment I spotted her tyrannical, uber-politically correct little smirk. Barf.<br /><br />Yes, Lance Henriksen is admittedly cool. Like Clint Eastwood, Henriksen is one of those actors who can charm the camera merely by sleeping. "Alien versus Predator" is cooller by his mere presence.<br /><br />Really, though, there are three issues that will determine your enjoyment level here---and incidentally, why I'm giving this strangely subdued little flick four stars (and frankly, I just picked up the DVD of the flick if *only* as a pretty screen saver---gorgeous picture/sound tailor-made for showing off your new home entertainment rig---but otherwise not very loaded):<br /><br />1) Best film representation yet of an Alien Queen Mother stomping around and showing us her `War Face'.  I'd have the Alien Queen signed up with my Squad any day of the week, Master Chief Sir!  You go girl!<br /><br />2) The Antarctic ziggurat idea was nice---nicely delivered, nicely envisioned, gorgeously executed.  It was a handsome, well developed setpiece that could have served as a superb arena of death, pain, suffering, bloodshed, and carnage.<br /><br />Anderson uses it for what seems like maybe 15 minutes.  And wouldn't it have been a little more fun to see the characters threatened, challenged by, crushed to bloody fragments by the shifting walls and crashing barriers?<br /><br />3) The critters have never looked better.  The flick delivers four-score and seven years when Anderson just pulls back and lets them pound out their deep-space loving.  The Alien is happy, the Predator is happy, and we're happy.  Like the light saber duel in that first Star Wars prequel---that's what we're here for!  Would it really have been so bad to give us more?<br /><br />I'm an Aliens & Predator franchise fanatic: bear that in mind. Half the joy of the flick (apart from the signature critters going mano a mano in a pre-Colombian labyrinth) comes from seeing my two beloved franchises brought into a bloodthirsty close encounter: from the brutally practical Aliens-style green computer block lettering in the opening credits shunted out by the Predator blood-red tactical lettering, to the surprise visitor at the end of the flick.  If you came to see Beast on Beast, then you'll go home happy: otherwise avoid.<br /><br />And remember: per official Company directive, this movie is totally expendable---and so are you.</p></body></html>

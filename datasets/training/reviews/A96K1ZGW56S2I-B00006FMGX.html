<meta name="summary" content="Classic Spielberg."></head><body><p>Steven Spielberg directed two movies that were released in 2002. One was MINORITY REPORT, that sci-fi futuristic suspense film starring Tom Cruise. That movie represented the "new" Spielberg, the director who's view of the world has become much more dark and sinister. Yet, in that film there were hints of the of comedy and dark humor that were reminiscent of the "old" family friendly Spielberg. Spielberg's other film of 2002 is CATCH ME IF YOU CAN and it's a classic Spielberg piece in everyway.<p>The movie is warm, light-hearteded, and full of nostaligia. That is ironic in a way considering the movie is based upon the crime spree of the world's most successful con artist, Frank Abagdale. Of course, if you've read Frank's memoir of the same name, you know that's how the book is too. Therefore, the film stays true to the spirit of the book, messing with history just enough to make the movie more compelling, dramatic, and lively.<p>The whole look of the film; from the cars, clothing, hairstyles, and Christmas ornaments; captures the style and era of the mid-1960's. The soundtrack is great and the movie's main theme is another tune that makes a nice addition to the John Williams canon.<p>Every performance Tom Hanks has done since SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE has beengolden and CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is no exception. Leonardo DiCaprio does a wonderful job as the main character and Christopher Walken pulls off a supporting performance that should earn him an Oscar nomination.<p>The movie is fun to watch and hearkens back to the good old days of Spielberg when he made movies that were just good movies. It does lack depth, but not every film has to change the world.</p></body></html>

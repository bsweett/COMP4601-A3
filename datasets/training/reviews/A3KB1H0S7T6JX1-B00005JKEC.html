<meta name="summary" content=""You're a long way from Starbucks, Homey!""></head><body><p>Training Day sheds light (as it should do) on police corruption as well as on crime and violence in the streets and neighborhoods of Los Angeles.<br /><br />It is officer Hoyt's first day under the supervision and tutelage of LAPD detective Alonzo Harris, when things take a quick turn for the unexpected...<br /><br />Ethan Hawke, Denzel Washington, Snoop Dogg, Tom Berenger, Macy Gray (!), Samantha Esteban (who is HOT!!!) and the rest of the cast carry out their performances well.<br /><br />In short, the music, the acting, the plot, the setting, and the dialogues are all good.<br /><br />In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment.</p></body></html>

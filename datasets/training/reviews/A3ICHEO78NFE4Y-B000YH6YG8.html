<meta name="summary" content="A film that should be shown to every high school student"></head><body><p>This film is a master piece! I will not pretend to say that i don't have any racist feelings because i do. So i had mixed feelings while seeing this film. Part of me was going "ya!" and part of me was ashamed.We will always have hatred in america. Those who say they do not hate are phonys. I do have hate but seeing this film it gives hate a place to put that hate on a shelf. You WILL learn from this film and that is exactly the message that this film has. We are here on earth to learn and this movie is a wonderful example of how to learn to control and understand the people we fear. Give this film a change, you will learn alot about people and about yourself. As far as the acting? Hats off to Ed Norton! He's a rare Hollywood talent who has all my respect. He knows his craft and is excellent at it. The supporting cast is also equally as good. This is a very powerful movie and hope that it is listed as a very important film in the 20th/21st Century.</p></body></html>

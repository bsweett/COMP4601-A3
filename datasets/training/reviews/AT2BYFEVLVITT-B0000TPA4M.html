<meta name="summary" content="Great old film!"></head><body><p>I decided to buy this movie more or less for a change. I don't usually watch or like movies which are older than I am, but this is one of the  exceptions. I had never actually seen the whole movie, just bits and pieces  every once in awhile, plus the film is such a huge part of popular culture  I was already familiar with the whole story. After seeing it in full I  can't help but love it. Sure the acting is sappy, but its a thirty years  old. I thought Fox did a great job with this dvd version. The picture is  crisp and clear, plus most of the sound throughout the film is very good  and not choppy, which is often rare with films of this age.<p>I won't get  into telling the whole story, as many other reviewers have done so already.  For me though the story was very intriguing and I really got into the  movie, plus, this film has one of the best endings that I have ever seen,  if only more films ended like that :) Anyways, if you haven't seen this  movie ever, or in a long time, I recommend picking up this DVD release, it  won't get any better than this.</p></body></html>

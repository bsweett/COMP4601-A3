<meta name="summary" content="Wild Hogs review"></head><body><p>This movie is great fun with a fantastic line-up of talented comics.  Be sure to get the version with the deleted scenes and watch them (shame they had to cut them out). A hilarious look at grown men trying to re-capture their youth. Also a great choice for motorcycle fans of all ages.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

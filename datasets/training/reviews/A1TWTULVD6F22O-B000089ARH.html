Cameron Crowe is obviously an authentic student of the era.  If you don't know that the story is a rough autobiography of Crowe's own experience as the enfant terrible of rock journalism, you may find the plot to be unbelievable.<p>Crowe admits to combining many of the elements of several rock bands that he chronicled for Creem and Rolling Stone to create Stillwater, the fictional rock band of this tale.  Sights, sounds, clothing and thought processes of the era are all faithfully reported in this gem of a movie.<p>Watching the Crowe interview in the special features section, and checking out his Rolling Stone articles, you know that the casting director for the film was a genius.  Unknown Patrick Fugit has many of the mannerisms and wistfulness that made &quot;then-Cameron&quot; and &quot;now-Cameron&quot; delightful and admirable.<p>The real star of the movie is the music, and the mix of authentic and pretend rock of the era, along with some of its unusual anthems (all of Elton John's early music touched cords in rock lovers - we weren't sure why we loved it, but we did).  The group scenes in the movie, most set to music, have an authentic camaraderie and sense of &quot;chilling&quot; that made ecletic groups of band members such memorable icons of the era.  <p>Crowe was obviously enamored of both his mom and Lester Bangs, an early mentor.  He cast them richly with the incredible Frances McDormand and a beautiful cameo piece by Phillip Seymour Hoffman.<br />Many of the band members and wannabes were well cast, but the centerpiece is Kate Hudson, who illuminates the screen with her charisma and vulnerability.  A well deserved Oscar for a talented young actress.<p>This film earns a resounding 5 stars - there is not a target audience, because there will be something for everyone to enjoy.<br />Buy, don't rent the DVD!</p></body></html>

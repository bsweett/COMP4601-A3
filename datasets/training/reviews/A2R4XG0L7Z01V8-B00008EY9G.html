<meta name="summary" content="Very strange, but intriguing"></head><body><p>This sounded like a very interesting movie, so I borrowed it. It had an good cast, and there's always a face you recognise from somewhere, even if you can't put a name to the face.<br /><br />Despite being a highly predictable movie, and you end up working out the actual twist at the end (part of it anyway), it's quite enjoyable, even if I did have to keep pausing the DVD so I could work out what was happening on screen.<br /><br />Most of the actors, including John Cusack, Ray Liotta, Clea Duvall, Rebecca DeMornay (who appears to have a LOT of work done, and I don't just mean her hair colour), Amanda Peet, Jake Busey and William Lee Scott, but my particular favourite was Clea Duvall, as she did an absolutely fantastic job. Her screaming, when her husband of 9-hours was banging on the bathroom door was terrifying. All the characters have surnames of US states, which doesn't really make much sense right until the end. The names include: Edward 'Ed' Dakota, James 'Jim' Rhodes, Paris Nevada, George York, Alice York, Timmy York, Larry Washington, Caroline Suzanne, Ginny Virginia, Lou Isiana, and Robert Maine. The actual 'connection' between all the characters (apart from the one at the start) is really silly to be honest.<br /><br />The finale will probably confuse a lot of people, and completely floored me. Without giving too much away, it's one of those finales, that will have you thinking about the rest of the movie, and trying to figure out what the hell happened. And as for the fact that there's supposed to be a alternate ending on the DVD - I couldn't find it! I checked both the endings on the theatrical release, and the extended one, and couldn't see any difference. Unless it's an easter egg.<br /><br />The film also doesn't know what it wants to be: horror, mystery, drama, comedy, psycho movie, or just simply surreal. The ending is very strange, but ties up all loose ends up, just incase you were thinking that.<br /><br />I doubt I would ever watch this film again, so I'm glad I borrowed it, rather than buying it the second I saw it - which is what I normally do. It's certainly one of those films where you'll remember the twist, and that will certainly put you off watching, rather than something like Sixth Sense, where you look for new clues to the twist at the end, each time you watch.<br /><br />The extras include: commentary by director James Mangold; exclusive branched version of film with alternative ending (bull) and additional scene; deleted scenes with director's commentary; storyboard comparisons and STARZ special: On the Set of Identity.<br /><br />I would say this movie is well worth a peek, just try not to work out the twists before the film starts. And don't read any reviews beforehand! I wasn't expecting there to be a twist, as I hadn't read any reviews.</p></body></html>

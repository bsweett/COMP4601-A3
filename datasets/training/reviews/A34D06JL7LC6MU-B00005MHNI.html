<meta name="summary" content="A Timeless Work of Art"></head><body><p>A Clockwork Orange is one of three films, along with Dr. Strangelove and 2001: A Space Odyssey, generally regarded as Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece and is probably my personal favorite of the three. Adapted from Anthony Burgess' 1962 novel of the same name, A Clockwork Orange is a violent, controversial film with some of the most iconic images in cinematic history and is easily the most accessible of those three Kubrick films. The film satirizes society, politics, and is also (like many Kubrick films) deeply philosophical. In addition, it's also one of the most surreal and endlessly fascinating films ever made.<br /><br />The film opens iconically with a close-up of the anti-hero protagonist and narrator Alex (Malcolm McDowell) and slowly pulls back to reveal his three droogs (Pete, Georgie, and Dim) sitting in the Korova Milk Bar where they are enjoying "milk plus" before embarking on a night fraught with "ultra-violence." Alex and his droogs wreak havoc in thoroughly immoral ways, beginning with the beating of an elderly vagrant and concluding with a home-invasion and rape, the latter performed while Alex joyfully sings "Singin' in the Rain." When he's not terrorizing the countryside by night, Alex is shown religiously listening to the music of Ludwig van Beethoven and inviting some girls back to his house to participate in a bit of the old "in-out, in-out." After Alex is betrayed by his droogs and sentenced to a 14-year stay in prison, he is given the chance to participate in a new experiment that will see his sentence commuted by brainwashing him into being unable to commit such atrocities.<br /><br />In addition to being a novelist, Burgess was also a linguist and the characters in A Clockwork Orange speak in Nadsat, slang comprised of Russian, English, and Cockney rhyming slang. For the adaptation, this remained intact and is one of the film's most indelible aspects. It's one of the reasons that the film is so memorable and timeless, as well as a contributor to what makes it so original. The brilliance of the story comes from Burgess, but the brilliance of the film is all Kubrick. A Clockwork Orange does not simply function on the foundation of having a brilliant story, but on the way that story is conveyed. This is one of the best assembled films ever made with one amazing scene consistently following another.<br /><br />The term "film composition" is never more appropriate than when discussing the works of Stanley Kubrick, as he treated each film like a musical composition with each piece falling perfectly into place at the precise moment. The composition of this film is masterful, perfect and it maintains an atmosphere so unlike any other film. Speaking of musical composition, it's impossible to separate this film and its spellbinding effect from the music of Ludwig van Beethoven that makes up a large part of the film's score. It may be a bold statement, but those looking for a perfect film need look no further. There is never a dull moment in A Clockwork Orange and this is not simply because of a compelling story, but because of the spell the film casts with performances that are like choreographed dance and the production design/art direction (by John Barry, Russell Hagg, and Peter Sheilds) that is truly a thing of beauty. There is not a single film in all of history that looks like this one and it's one of the best looking films you'll ever see.<br /><br />The whole cast give pitch-perfect performances and, typical once again of Kubrick films, several minor supporting roles are populated with actors who stand out substantially due to their little quirks. McDowell gives the performance of a lifetime as Alex, the role that made him an icon in addition to leaving him forever typecast. Shades of the character are noticeable in McDowell's earlier performance in If..., the film that inspired Kubrick to cast him, but it's a fully-realized, simultaneously comical and menacing performance here and it's doubtful that anyone could have pulled it off as marvelously as McDowell. He appears in every scene and carries the entire film on his shoulders with his mannerisms, voice, and movement, all of which are partly responsible for keeping the audience glued to the screen. In minor roles, the most unforgettable are arguably Patrick Magee (as F. Alexander, the writer whose home is invaded early on) and Aubrey Morris (as probation officer P.R. Deltoid). Deltoid's high-strung, comically nervous way of adding "mmm...yes" to the end of every sentence and Magee's creepy and unforgettable transformation from a quiet writer to a madman make these performances stand out even with very little screen time.<br /><br />I'm not the first person to say it nor will I be the last, but A Clockwork Orange is a work of art and stands as one of the best films ever made. Nothing in Kubrick's oeuvre remotely resembles it and yet it's so thoroughly Kubrick's work; a film that casts a spell on you with its biting originality and carries you through a cinematic world so uniquely its own. Kubrick began as a photographer and that profession largely contributes to why so many iconic, unforgettable images spawn from his films. Kubrick, possibly more so than any other director, knew how to point a camera at a particular image and get the most effective shot from it. Nearly every frame of this film is perfect from a photographic standpoint and easily has the best opening and closing shots of any film I can readily recall.<br /><br />It's a film that, with its political, societal, and moral implications, makes you think. It's a film that continues to cast a spell after repeated viewings; a film that still manages to entertain, shock, and excite. It remains, as it did at the time of its release, a controversial, subversive, and brilliant film that even the casual filmgoer cannot help but be drawn to. 40 years after it was made and there are still not enough adjectives to accurately convey how blisteringly original, brave, and immersive it is. With this recent Blu-Ray release, you're able to experience the film all over again and it's never looked or sounded better. Like nearly all of his films, this one had the Kubrick touch and, as such, it's pure cinematic gold.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></body></html>

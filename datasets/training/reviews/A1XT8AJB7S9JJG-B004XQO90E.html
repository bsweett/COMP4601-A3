<meta name="summary" content="A very Quantum Leap like movie that is very fun to watch.  A movie that makes you think about it when its over. I say B+"></head><body><p>"What would you do if you knew you only had one minute to live?"  Colter Stevens (Gyllenhaal) is picked to be part of a new and secret plan.  He is able to relive the last eight minutes of someones life over and over in order to stop terrorist activity.  The only problem is that he doesn't realize it at first.  His goal is to find out who bombed a train in Chicago in order to stop a bigger and more deadly explosion later in the day, but Colter wants to change the plans, if he can.  This is a very good movie, but one you must pay attention to in order to follow it easily.  This is from the same director of "Moon", so if you have seen that movie you will know what to expect from this movie.  This is a movie that would get better the more you watch, very layered type of movie and you will be able to catch different things each time you watch.  One of the better sci-fi/thrillers along the lines of "Inception" and "Adjustment Bureau", not as good as those, but comparisons could be drawn.  Overall, a very interesting movie that needs to be seen more then once in order to fully get what you need out of it.  I liked it though.  I give it a B+.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - Yes I would, you almost should.<br /><br />*Also try - Speed Of Thought & Moon</p></body></html>

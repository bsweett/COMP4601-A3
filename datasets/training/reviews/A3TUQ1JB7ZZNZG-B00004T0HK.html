<meta name="summary" content="One of the best movies ever......"></head><body><p>One afternoon while there was nothing to do I decided to go and see this film. This may be one of the biggest surprises of my life. A very well acted and made movie it tackled large subjects without flinching and not avoiding.<br />The movie stars Edward Norton as Derrick Vinvard. A former skinhead who has just been released from prison to find his brother Danny played by Edward Furlong is following in his footsteps. Beverly D'Angelo, Avery Brooks, Elliot Gould and Stacey Keach are all fantastic in the supporting roles but it's both Furlong and Norton ,mostly Norton, who really have the floor in this movie.<br />The movie takes a good look at racisim, and hate and never losses it's focus. Norton is proving that he is the best young actor of this generation and he recieved a much deserved Oscar Nomination for this role. At time difficult to watch becouse of it's unflinching look into the world's of hate, prison and redemption.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Killer movie with killer extras."></head><body><p>This is one of those movies that just stand out above anything else made before it. In essence it is a horror movie, yet it is much more. Anybody can make a slasher flick with some killer picking off the cast. Tons of movies already have been made with that formula. Alien goes way beyond clich&eacute; horror with a truly engaging story and well thought out setting.<br /><br />As a horror movie it is well done. Not a lot of those cheesy horror clich&eacute;s you find so often in many movies of that genre. Sure you have the occasional startling noise or false alarm surprises, but they weren't overdone and succeeded in building the suspense. Also Ridley Scott was smart to keep the alien creature's appearances minimal. It's better to tease the audience with a glance here and there than kill the mystique of the monster by showing too much of it.<br /><br />I have to give kudos to director Ridley Scott and his design team for the meticulous detail done in Alien. I also have to thank Scott for taking the time to show this detail to us with some nice camera sweeps and perspective shots. All the sets and technology mixed well, and H.R. Geiger's designs for all the alien stuff is truly groundbreaking and sets a standard that lasts even today.<br /><br />I like the plot and how it unfolds with details that don't just involve the alien. Makes the movie a lot more interesting to watch. Acting is also top notch. All of the characters acted in the best way I can describe as a documentary style, where you see spontaneous emotion and reactions. I recall hearing that the actors did have room to improvise on some scenes. However the methods, the end results speaks for itself.<br /><br />When I saw Alien in the theatres it scared the snot out of me. When I saw it again on DVD with a big screen and good speakers I still felt some of the old chills. I recommend a decent system to get the most out of this movie. I recall seeing it on a tiny 15" screen about six feet away and not get the same thrills. I suppose if you don't like horror shows then that's the way to see it.<br /><br />The DVD is packed with goodies, which was a pleasant surprise given the kinds of extras you get from DVDs back then. There is an informative director commentary by Ridley Scott that gives a lot of great information. The deleted scenes are cool. Even the ones that aren't fully produced. The outtakes are fun too, but not as much as the deleted scenes. There is also a LOT of production photos and notes as well. No documentaries, but then again you don't need them after you hear Ridley's commentary.<br /><br />This is the movie that started a whole franchise. It deserves all the fame and credit it received. While the new Collector's Edition has a lot more extras this DVD is definitely no slouch and gives you much more than most SpecialExtendedUberFantasticCollectors editions that keep being rehashed. They gave you a great DVD the first time out.</p></body></html>

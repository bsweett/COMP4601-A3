<meta name="summary" content="Mad Mila; Beyond Zombie-Dome.  A Sci-fi Channel Original."></head><body><p>Ok, I know the Sci-fi channel had nothing to do with this.  I'm obviously using their reputation for fine film making (tongue firmly in cheek) as a measure of this films quality.  Is "Resident Evil; Extinction" really that bad? No, it's not THAT bad, but it's not so good either.  To understand where I'm coming from, let's quickly rehash my thoughts on the first 2 films;<br /><br />Resident Evil:  Original, edgy story, (despite cheesing off the video game crowd), creative visuals and fair characters combine to create a surprisingly good zombie, action, horror film.  The Director did a nice job with a relatively tight budget.<br /><br />Resident Evil; Apocalypse:  A simple story that appeased the video game fans, goofy monster effects and big budget explosions combine for an in-your-face silly action movie.  Gone is the great tension and visuals of the first film; still fun in a stupid way.<br /><br />This brings us up to date on where I stand in the Resident Evil series... ...until now.<br />"Extinction" suffered with, what I call, CREATIVE CONSTIPATION!! Dun, Dun, DAHH! (Very dramatic, I know).  Let's get down to it...<br /><br />-BEST OF BOTH MAKES WORST OF ALL<br />This film had elements from the first film that I enjoyed a lot (i.e.; the laser room; very cool) and elements from the second film (goofy monsters) that combined to make a more confused film than either of the first two.  As much as the second film disappointed me it was, at least, consistent in its mood and values.  As pleasantly surprised as I was with the first film, its best elements don't work when out of the context of the edgy story and creative environment.  The only thing that translated well was the theme music, which is still effective at setting a mood.<br /><br />-CAN YOU SAY; DERIVATIVE<br />I can forgive copying in the context of homage or as a respectful nod, but the "Road Warrior" theme came off as derivative here.  Certainly, in the context of a dying planet, copying "Road Warrior" would seem a logical choice.  However, did they really need a skinny bearded guy with big teeth and a strange hat (i.e.; the helicopter guy in RW)?  Of course, like most zombie films, the entire series pays respect to George Romero's zombie rule (infection by blood, head shots required, etc.),  and clearly is borrowing concepts from Romero as they make sense (i.e. ; experimenting on zombies, domesticating zombies) without ever raising the social questions.  Regardless of the intent; this film depended so heavily on past work that I could not help critique its lack of originality.<br /><br />-HOW DEAD CAN YOU GET?<br />The thing most frightening and disturbing about zombies is that they once were normal people.  In the first film, with a lesser budget, zombie makeup was limited mostly to grey face paint, prosthetic wounds and an emphases on good zombie acting.  This is the kind of zombie I appreciate the most; still human but lacking their humanity.  These are the zombies that give me the creeps because they seem somewhat plausible.  "Extinction" definitely had too much money to spend on makeup, because these zombies were so latex heavy that they lost all humanity and became monsters.  Also missing was the attention to detail where zombie acting was concerned; just a bunch of people in masks running around and attacking people.  More makeup does not mean more dead; just less human.<br /><br />-IT'S OVER WHEN I SAY "WTF!!!"<br />Here are a couple things that I had to sneer at (SPOILER ALLERT for those interested).<br />-In one of the least surprising moments in a film ever to be presented as a revelation, Alice (Mila) finds out that she is the savior of all mankind.  If you didn't figure this out in the first film; shame on you.  The ability to fry circuits in space WAS a surprise; ugh!<br />-Apparently, too much vaccination can cause otherworldly mutations in humans infected with the "T" virus.  When I say otherworldly, I mean you will be able to instantly heal, use bad breath as a concussion weapon and grow tentacle fingers capable of shooting across the room.  This is amazing since it never did more than stop zombification before (sometimes it didn't help at all).  The worst part is, the mutation looked pretty bad.<br />-You shouldn't drive heavy trucks and Hummers in a post-apocalyptic world; fuel mileage will be a bit of a problem.<br /><br />-IF YOU CAN'T SAY SOMETHING NICE...<br />So here's a list of things I thought were cool or interesting but only as stand-alone ideas that could not make this a good film on their own:  (some more SPOILERS, beware.)<br />-Zombie Crows; a scary proposition.<br />-I liked the main characters for what they're worth; not great, but not bad either.<br />-A zombie bomb (drop a dumpster full of zombies) was kind of clever.<br />-The laser room (sorry, it's just so cool!!)<br />-I give Mila credit for her ability as an action Heroine.  She is very capable.<br />-There was nothing inherently wrong with the production values.<br /><br />-HOW CAN I WRITE SO MUCH ABOUT SO LITTLE?<br />Yea, really; this film did not warrant such "deep" analysis.  I thought the first RE film was very creative and creepy.  I thought the second was crude and dumb but entertaining on a basic level.  This third film was visually better than the second but lacked the cohesiveness and creativity of the first.  As a result, you get a mish-mash of a film.  Big Budget production values with a less than enthralling story.  I can only recommend this for fans of the game and completists who must have the whole series.<br /> -Visuals......4 stars<br />-Characters...3.5 stars<br />-Story.........2.5 stars<br />-Monsters....2 stars<br />-Fun/scares..2.5 stars<br />Average.....2.9 stars.</p></body></html>

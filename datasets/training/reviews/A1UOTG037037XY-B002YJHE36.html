<meta name="summary" content="Was Galileo Jewish?"></head><body><p>The Jews have been a part of Rome for a long time so where would someone get the surname Galileo?  Galilee? I kept wondering while watching this solidly entertaining sequel to Da Vinci Code which was more sensationalistic.  This is a good movie with a less cute cast but with more food for thought.  I would recommend watching this movie but unlike Da Vinci Code, I have no plans to buy it.  I think the cast from the Da Vinci Code was just jazzier.  Fans of Flame and Cintron and Swedes will enjoy that two members of the Swiss Guard are played by Danish Flame and Swedish Stellan Skarsgaard aka Eric Northman's dad.</p></body></html>

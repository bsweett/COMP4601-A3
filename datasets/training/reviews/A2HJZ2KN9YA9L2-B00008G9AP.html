<meta name="summary" content="Harry Potter & the Chamber of Secrets"></head><body><p>I read an interview with Ray Bradbury once where he said that the best way to adapt his books was to simply "stuff the pages into the camera."  This is what has been done with the Harry Potter adaptations so far and the results are wonders to behold.  <p>Chamber of Secrets may be even better than Sorcerer's Stone.  The first film was the introduction, this film provides a very solid plot, even as we meet new characters, some of whom will only be in this film (Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts Instructor, is a safe revelation.  Each teacher only lasts a year.)<p>Others are welcome returns, especially Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid.  But Richard Harris, in his final film, sadly looked tired and worn out, gamely going on with the show even if he wasn't feeling up to it.  Of course the scenario did require all of the characters to undergo a great deal of stress so in context of the movie it works.  The actors seem to have settled into their roles very comfortably and deliver strong performances throughout.<p>This movie is darker and scarier than the first one with better special effects.  The plot follows Harry on his 2nd year at Hogwarts where students start to be found in a petrified state -- frozen solid.  Harry also starts to hear a slithering voice saying "Kill kill," and is often the first on the scene, making him a prime suspect.  The words "The Chamber of Secrets has been opened" are written on the wall at the scene of the first attack, deepening the mystery for our hero.  He and his friends Ron and Hermione must find out what the Chamber of Secrets is in order to save Hogwarts.<p>The film runs 2 hours and 41 minutes, which is long for an alleged children's movie.  But, although I often believe that most movies released during the past few years have tended to be too long, this is one of the exceptions.  J.K. Rowling fashioned a very well constructed novel where everything played a part, from the flying car and Ron's younger sister at the beginning, to Hagrid's continued fascination with exotic creatures to Dobby the House Elf causing muschief for Harry Potter, to Draco Malfoy taunting Hermione to Moaning Myrtle who haunts a girls' lavatory.  There was nothing that could be cut and keep the story coherent.</p></body></html>

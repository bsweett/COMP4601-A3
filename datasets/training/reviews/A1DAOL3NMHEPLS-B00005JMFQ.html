<meta name="summary" content="Lightweight and overly contrived, but enjoyable nonetheless"></head><body><p>I'm not usually a big fan of romantic comedies, but I enjoyed "Love Actually" nonetheless, mostly because the performances by the various actors were entertaining and the pacing was brisk enough that I didn't get bored even though the movie is over two hours long. There are perhaps too many story lines, but overall this is a good choice if you like British humor and don't mind romantic cliches.  I give this a low 4 stars.</p></body></html>

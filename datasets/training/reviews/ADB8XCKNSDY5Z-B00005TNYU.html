<meta name="summary" content="Indiana Jones for Kids"></head><body><p>Maybe I should say "for teens" since the movie has some inappropriate language and situations, but I first saw The Goonies in my pre-teen years and loved it.  Heck, I continue to love it even to this day.  It's about a group of kids that find a treasure map in an attic full of old pirate antiques.  A pretty seamless transition then takes place, considering the unusual circumstances, where the kids follow the map to an old abandoned restaurant that serves as a hideout for a family of escaped convicts.  The rest of the movie is a wild chase for the kids, as they make their way through a booby-trap infested tunnel with escaped convicts right on their tail.  The creative booby-traps are very reminiscent of Indiana Jones, which shouldn't surprise anybody who watches movie credits, and even though the content is most unusual, the movie never loses it's believablity (except, perhaps, during the Superman shirt gag).<br /><br />This may very well be my favorite Spielberg film.</p></body></html>

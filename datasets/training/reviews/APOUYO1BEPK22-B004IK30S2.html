Good looks, smooth moves, great suits, and the best job in the world as the number one lead Anchorman in San Diego. He even has his own entourage that consists of his fellow newsmen. Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd) is the on-scene reporter, as well as a self-proclaimed ladies man. Champ Kind (David Koechner) is the sports analyst and almost a `much too close' friend of Ron's. Then there is Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) who is the weatherman and, well, lets just say `not so smart' guy of the group. They are kings of the news in San Diego, until a Veronica Cornerstone (Christina Applegate) shows up. As Veronica is trying to work her way into the camera lens, the boys are trying to keep her out. They are doing quite well, until one day when Ron has a freak accident, which lets Veronica have center stage.<br /><br />The first time I saw this was with two of my best friends when I was driving through Texas and stopped for a few days of having fun in San Antonio. For most of the first half of the movie, I was barely laughing, and almost not enjoying the movie. And then about 35% to 50% into the movie, it clicked. I started to get the humor. And then the movie became hysterical. I was in tears on some parts. Now after the DVD came out, I even loved the movie more. From beginning to end, I find the whole movie hilarious. I honestly can understand why some might really hate this movie. The jokes can be very dumb at times. But once you find the humor in how the jokes are delivered, it becomes golden. The things I find myself laughing at the most are how the lines are delivered, or how some of the words are annunciated. The over the top acting also helps out a lot. It's just VERY silly. The improv lines are great also. When Ron and Veronica are smiling on camera and talking, the sound is muted for the audience in the movie while the credits role, but we as the viewers get to hear them hate on each other such as Ron saying "I'm going to hit you right in the baby maker, yep, right in the ovaries". The movie has a slew of cameos from some very funny actors as well. Jack Black, Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, and even Seth Rogen (not a funny part at all really, but it's funny seeing him just be a plain old camera man with like 2 lines).<br /><br />In the end, if you love this kind of silly comedy, then definitely own this. It never gets old.<br /><br />P.S. - I own the double disk feature, and have yet to watch "the adventures of Ron Burgundy continue" feature yet. It's supposedly a ton of extra stuff they cut out from the movie. Enough to make a completely different movie. I fast forwarded through it enough to see there is like a bank heist and everything. So I'll give it a look-see sometime soon once I get the urge to watch some more Ron Burgundy. Then I'll just update my review with its review.</p></body></html>

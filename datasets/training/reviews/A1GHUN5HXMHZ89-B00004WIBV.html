<meta name="summary" content="Johnny Depp Rules"></head><body><p>Johnny Depp is an exceptional performer. Look at all the movies he has done. He is one of the best Chameleons I have ever seen. He throws himself totally into his roles. Sleepy Hollow is no exception. I love this modification of the original story. Making Ichabod Crane a detective rather than a teacher was brilliant. When he comes from the city to investigate a Sleepy Hollow decapitation, he finds that there is much more to the crime than what meets the eye. The support cast is great and some well known names are amongst them. Tim Burton did a wonderful job of making the atmosphere beautiful and frightful.<br /><br />Christopher Walken is magnificent as the Hessian that is now headless. Walken is another Chameleon that can marvel you with his stylish bravado. He plays the blood thirsty Hessian mercenary to the hilt.  The special effects are incredible including the seamless transitions of the horse and rider entering and exiting a tree. A very dark and spooky rendition compared to the previous versions of Sleepy Hollow. The DVD quality is wonderfully sharp and crisp. This DVD includes a featurette "Behind the Legend". The are numerous extras that make this the best Halloween movie I have.</p></body></html>

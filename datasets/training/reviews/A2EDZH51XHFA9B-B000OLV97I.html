And my oh my, is it an ambitious one-- Christopher Paolini's epic novel Eragon, here adapted by Peter Buchman. Don't know the name? Well, this was only his second project. The first was Jurassic Park III.<br /><br />Are alarm bells going off in your head yet? They should be.<br /><br />If there's one thing Peter Jackson's adaptations of Tolkien taught us, it's that if you put a lot of effects in a movie and back it up with some solid characters, audiences will, in fact, sit through three hours of movie. (Most other countries in the world recognize this. It's only America where we have this odd attention span problem with movies over two hours.) And Eragon demands a three-hour treatment; I mean, come on, this is a book of almost six hundred pages, and it's dense. Paolini packed a great deal of action into those pages, but there was more than enough room for character development, uneasy alliances, witty repartee, and all the other things that made the book such a fun read. Buchman, in short, butchered it. Major characters disappear entirely, and others exist only, it seems, to pacify readers of the novel. (Murtagh is the biggest major character given short shrift, getting only eight lines; the big plot twist regarding him is relegated to a useless piece of trivia in the film.) He did keep a good portion of the action, but that's about it.<br /><br />Worse is (some of) the acting. There are a number of big names in here, and they give varying levels of expertise in their performances. Jeremy Irons, by far, is the brightest light among them. As Brom, Eragon's mentor, Irons conveys the character's mix of amusement, despair, and gratitude quite well (in fact, Irons makes Brom a much more likable and three-dimensional chap than he was in the book). John Malkovich comes perilously close to overacting to unintentional hilarity as King Galbatorix; his only saving grace is that he doesn't get enough screen time to really mess things up. Joss Stone is as flatly uninteresting an actress as she is a singer. Robert Carlyle I didn't even recognize, he's so cardboard here. Djimon Hounsou looks as if he's about ready to burst into laughter at the ludicrousness of it all. Edward Speelers, the unknown cast in the title role, comes relatively close to getting it right, but there's no sense of him going from na?ve farm boy to accomplished warrior-mage. (I am, however, willing to place the blame for that entirely on the butchered script.) The others? Don't bother. Speelers, Irons, and Rachel Weisz (as the voice of Sephira the dragon) are the only characters here who get more than twenty or thirty lines in the entire film.<br /><br />The one thing Eragon does have in its favor is the visual effects. Given Fangmeier's usual job description, that's not surprising. A lot of the effects seem rather unrooted in the storyline, but there you go. And while Sephira's development is mostly sacrificed in the interests of saving time, what we see of her is wonderful, especially the scenes of her as an infant.<br /><br />Despite the above, I have to say, I seem to have liked the movie a lot more than most people did. It is not the book by any means, and it is clumsily-handled in the extreme, but I think it does manage to do what it sets out to-- be a mindless action flick with a whole lot of special effects. For a turn-your-brain-off good time, it's not awful if you've never read the book. ** ?</p></body></html>

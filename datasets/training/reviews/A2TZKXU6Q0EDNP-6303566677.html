<meta name="summary" content="Future meets present. Jury still out on the outcome..."></head><body><p>There are several reasons why the first Terminator was and still is better than its sequels.<br /><br />  First of all, even if one sees it now, 20 years after its original release it still holds its ground with particular tech-noir ease. It doesn't look dated and it actually gains charm as time goes by rather than lose any.<br /><br />  Then it's also the "feel" this film has. It still retains this unmistakable "indie film" quality allthough for its time back then it was definetely high budget. All the dark, industrial superbly edited scenes contribute to that feeling, and J.Cameron did a memorable job creating a film that was expensive but kept you watching not because of ultra-flashy effects, but because of an intriguing storyline, great directing, good to very good performances, and cool visuals.<br /><br />  Speaking of the storyline, in T1 it happens to be more consistent and solid than in the following Terminator installments. It's a solid script deserving of a classic sci-fi film, one that puts the T1 in a pantheon of great futuristic films.<br /><br />  Its superiority lies also in the fact that T1 is dark and ominously threatening in its entirety. The coldness and the relentlessness of the cyborg is its trademark sign and that's what sets its unique atmosphere. If it has lost something is that fact that the back-then not so famous protagonist has since become a megastar and a governor on top of it. This takes somewhat away from the charm of not being familiar with the actors but it's ultimately not enough to harm the film.<br /><br />  Cameron kept the effects at a minimum and yet managed to give his film a dominant aura of technological-doom. He used more industrial visuals of the present than of the future to achieve this and he was succesful by a good margin. It was after all one of his very best films.<br /><br />  The Terminator's machoism is well disguised underneath its fake skin and Arnold was a perfect cast for this role. He wasn't consumed enough back then to be taken in as funny even if he delivered lines like "I'll be back" or pronounces names with a German accent (Sarah Cannah anyone?).<br /><br />  One of the top 20 sci-fi films of all time.</p></body></html>

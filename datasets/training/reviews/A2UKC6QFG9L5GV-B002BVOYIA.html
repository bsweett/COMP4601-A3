There are no scenes of graphic violence here nevertheless the movie shocks and makes you hold your breath. It is almost phisically painful and unbearable let alone emotional pain.<br /><br />Hutu and Tutsis - two main nationalities of Rwanda. A long time ago Tutsis presumably came from Northern Africa, from Egypt or Ethiopia, they are tall, their skin is brown, they have chiselled features and they were cooperating with Belgian colonists all the time Europeans were occupying Rwanda. Hutu are presumably natives, they are stumpy, black like night and have rugged features. Belgians did not want them to cooperate considering useless and lazy. But once Belgians left the country it was only a matter of time when Hutu would want to take revenge upon Tutsis. And in blood-soaked Africa revenge always looms.<br /><br />I'd like to mention that if you're interested in this topic, there's a novel by Canadian writer Gil Courtemanche called "Un dimanche &agrave; la piscine &agrave; Kigali" translated as "A Sunday at the Pool in Kigali". Action takes place in the same hotel "Mille Collines" as in "Hotel Rwanda" and describes the beginning of Rwandan massacre that left behind nearly a million dead. The main character is a Canadian journalist who's in love with a Tutsi girl. And I'd say this book is not for the faint-hearted. In April, 2006 Canadian director Robert Favreau released a screen adaptation of the novel - "Un dimanche &agrave; Kigali". Although I haven't seen it yet, I hope it will be good.<br /><br />Saying that such films help us not to let something like this happen ever again is trivial, but it's true. And the more people know the history the better. The safer.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Fine, Rather Memorable "Superman Returns""></head><body><p>Along with fellow director Sam Raimi, Bryan Singer ought to be regarded now as the best American director of films based on comic book heroes. Having enjoyed his two fine filmed adaptations of the "X-Men" comic books, I had little reason to expect anything worse than yet another decent film adaptation from Singer. With "Superman Returns", Bryan Singer pays ample homage to Richard Donner's great 1978 "Superman" film and offers a superb cinematic epic in what promises to be a successful re-launch of a "Superman" film series. Much to my surprise, Singer's riveting new film isn't nearly as dark as his two "X-Men" films, but instead, remains true to the optimism and light comedy which Donner conveyed successfully on screen. Indeed, "Superman Returns" should be regarded as the immediate sequel to the first two "Superman" films starring the late Christopher Reeve, since it is set approximately five years after the second (1980) film, relying once more on John Williams' memorable "Superman" theme (courtesy of young film composer John Ottman, a frequent collaborator of Singer's) and a brief, digitally-realized cameo appearance of Marlon Brando as Superman/Clark Kent's father.<br /><br />Much of "Superman Returns" success is due to a fine script written by Bryan Singer's "X-Men" collaborators, Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris, and excellent acting from a truly memorable cast featuring distinguished veterans like Eva Marie Saint ("Martha Kent") and Frank Langella ("Perry White"). Although others have unfairly compared Brandon Routh's portrayal of Superman/Clark Kent to the late Christopher Reeve's, I found his portrayal quite credible, without trying too much to be quite evocative of his famous predecessor's brilliant portrayal. Without question, the best acting honors goes to actor Kevin Spacey, who brings a disarmingly devilish twist to Lex Luthor, transforming him into a more malevolent villain than Gene Hackman's splendid portrayal. Parker Posey is almost as fine too as Lex's femme fatale companion Kitty Kowalski. Actor Kevin Huntington steals nearly every scene he appears as the earnest, if naive, photojournalist Jimmy Olsen. I also enjoyed Kate Bosworth's portrayal of Lois Lane, but I will concede that hers isn't nearly as romantic as Margot Kidder's. And I didn't see nearly as much of a romantic chemistry between her and Routh (or with James Marsden, who portrays her fiance, Richard White, Perry White's nephew) as I recall seeing between Kidder and Reeve in the first two "Superman" films.<br /><br />Bryan Singer's direction is superb, though "Superman Returns" isn't as visually exciting as his two "X-Men" films. Still there are plenty of superb action sequences, beginning with Superman's breath-taking rescue of an out-of-control U. S. Air Force Boeing 777. All of these action sequences had the audience's rapt attention during a screening I saw yesterday afternoon. Singer's splendid "Superman Returns"  is undoubtedly a vivid, well-executed re-launch of the Man of the Steel as a potential cinematic franchise along the lines of the James Bond and "Star Wars" films. Having enjoyed Singer's "Superman Returns", I look forward to the prospect of a possible revival of the "Star Trek" movie franchise, which Singer may be at work on soon.</p></body></html>

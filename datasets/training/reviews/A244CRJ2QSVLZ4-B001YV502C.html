Extremely provocative, this film made me realize how important children are to our future.  Without them, the world becomes psychologically insane before dying a physical death.<br /><br />  Mother Nature has imposed her own form of birth control on mankind.  At first, a few women began miscarrying, then hundreds more until it became a world-wide epidemic.  It is now the year 2027 and a child has not been born in eighteen years; despair and grief has led the world to the brink of total destruction.  Every country, except Britain, seems to have collapsed.  The British government has launched a campaign to rid the country of all illegal immigrants known as Fugees.  One of these Fugees is a pregnant girl, Joy.  Theo Faron (Clive Owen of "Derailed") struggles to help her get safely to a boat owned by Operation Humanity.  Unfortunately, a terrorist group, the Fishes, wants to use Joy's baby as a pawn for its diabolical plans against the British government.<br /><br />  "Children of Men" is highly recommended for fans of apocalyptic, end-of-the-world horror.  Extremely tense and war-like in its graphic depiction of street violence, this film is highly emotional.  Not easily forgotten, it will leave you asking, "Could this really happen?"  One touching scene that made me cry was when Joy's baby was being carried out of a destroyed building.  The tenants stood spellbound, gaping and murmuring, "A baby.  A baby," as they remembered a world that was long gone.  A political statement as well as a disaster film, "Children of Men" should be added to your science fiction/horror/adventure collection.</p></body></html>

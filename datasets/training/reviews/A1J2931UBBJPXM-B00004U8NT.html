Things that only director Steven Spielberg can explain, which he does in his monumental epic of man's encounter with alien life, "Close Encounters of the Third Kind."  Planes lost in WWII suddenly appear in a Mexican desert; a long lost ship turns up in the middle of the Gobi Desert; and in Dharmsala, Northern India, hundreds of people are gathered together, singing--a short "tune" that consists of a mere five notes, over and over, repeatedly.  When they are asked where they heard this tune, the throng, as one, dramatically thrust their hands into the air and point to the sky.  And, indeed, in the skies all around the world, strange things are happening. <p>And even as these events are transpiring, one evening in Muncie, Indiana, the city is suddenly blacked out by an inexplicable power outage.  Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss) is at home when it hits, and he is called in by the power company for which he works, then sent out in the darkness to an unfamiliar location.  Lost, he sits in his pick-up truck at a railroad crossing, studying a map, when all at once he notices a "disturbance" around him.  Mailboxes along the side of the road are clanging open and shut by themselves; then things inside his truck begin to move, subtly at first, then erupting and flying about as if caught up in a tornado--and then just as suddenly his truck is engulfed in a blinding light.  He leans out the window for a look, but it's too bright and he has to pull back.  Then just as abruptly, it all stops-- the disturbance, the light-- everything.  And he looks out the window again; but this time he sees something.  And though he doesn't realize it at the time, at that moment, his life changed forever.<p>In this wonderfully realized, highly imaginative film that is extremely well crafted and presented by Spielberg, he takes you along with Roy in the days that follow that strange occurrence in Muncie.  Roy becomes lost in thought, drifting, unable to focus on anything, much to the consternation of his wife, Ronnie (Teri Garr).  But he can't help himself; something-- an image-- has begun to form in his mind.  He has no idea what it is or what it means, but it becomes an obsession, and slowly it begins to take shape:  First in a handful of shaving cream, then in a plate of mashed potatoes, which he piles up and begins to sculpt with his fork, while Ronnie and his kids look on in bewilderment.  But he can see it in his mind, and it's like a mountain-- a mountain shaped like a "tower."  And Roy isn't the only one.  Around the world, others are being drawn to the same image in their minds, and it's a force that compels them, pushing them on to find whatever it is, a power so strong in cannot be denied or refused.  They know only one thing:  Whatever it is, it's important, and they have no choice but to follow where it may lead.  And it becomes a great adventure, one in which they discover what Man has long suspected:  We are not alone.<p>Richard Dreyfuss is perfectly cast as Neary, a regular guy-- he could be your neighbor or the man who comes to install your phone-- and gives a thoroughly convincing, introspective performance while creating a character with whom it is easy to relate and through whom you are able to share this unique adventure.  Garr does a good job, as well, as Ronnie, the wife concerned with her husband's sudden and seemingly bizarre behavior, someone with whom you can certainly sympathize.  Dillon delivers, too, as the single mother who suddenly finds herself caught up in these inexplicable and extraordinary events, and also turning in a memorable performance is the young Cary Guffey, as Barry, Jillian's son, who makes his own connection with the other-worldly visitors. <p>The supporting cast includes Francois Truffaut (Lacombe), Bob Balaban (Laughlin) and Lance Henriksen (Robert).  An uplifting, positive motion picture, "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" is thoroughly entertaining, as well as thought provoking.  Spielberg draws you in as few filmmakers can, with a great story and with characters who are readily accessible and with whom it is easy to identify-- all of which adds up to an absorbing, memorable and enjoyable experience, and a perfect example of the real magic of the movies.</p></body></html>

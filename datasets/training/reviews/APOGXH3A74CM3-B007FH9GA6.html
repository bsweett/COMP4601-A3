<meta name="summary" content="Not disappointing"></head><body><p>I wasn't so sure about this movie, having seen the original trilogy, which I think is outstanding.  I'm not too big of a fan of remakes, often finding them disappointing knockoffs.<br /><br />That isn't the case here.  The story is riveting, with Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara) dominating every scene, and rightly so.  Her character is connected to the mystery being solved, and the retribution that's dished out.<br /><br />Daniel Craig did a good job with his character, and took the appropriate 2nd seat to Lisbeth.<br /><br />This movie holds its own, and is no knockoff.<br /><br />It's not disappointing at all.</p></body></html>

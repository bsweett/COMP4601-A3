While at her mother's beach house with Harry and her mother Erica (Diane Keaton), a 50 something, Harry has a heart attack. He recovers in the hospital under the care of Julian Mercer (Keanu Reeves), a 30 something--who is immediately attracted to Erica. Harry wants to leave the hospital--but the doctor will only let him go if he stays a weeks at Erica's beach house. Erica hates Harry, but agrees. Naturally they become attracted to each other...but the doctor is also attracted to Erica. Sometimes hilarious and romantic complications ensue.<br /><br />This movie took me by surprise, I wasn't sure if I could handle watching old actors getting it on but this movie turned out to be a great romantic comedy. Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton always give their 100% best in their performances, they did a great job in their roles. It would have been nice to see more input from Frances McDormand and Keanu Reeves, but otherwise I really enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />The movie has problems--it's WAY too long (there are at least 5 times I thought it was ending) and I HATED the ending. I won't give it away but Keaton ended up with the wrong guy! It's a quick turn around at the end that I just couldn't swallow.</p></body></html>

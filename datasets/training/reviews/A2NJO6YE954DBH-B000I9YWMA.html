<meta name="summary" content="A Jack the Ripper film that lays off the really bad stuff"></head><body><p>The most important thing you need to know about "From Hell," is that the Hughes Brothers really let you off easy with this one.  When you go home after seeing this movie late at night and have trouble getting to sleep, just remember that they could have shown you a lot more, which means you might not have gotten to sleep for a week.  I have read Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell's graphic novel "From Hell," and have also spent some time researching the historical record regarding Jack the Ripper, which includes not only autopsy reports but also photographs of the victims.  Consequently, I was surprised that the film verion of "From Hell" actually backed off three times from completely grossing out the audience.<br /><br />First, when the Ripper killed Annie Chapman he draped some of her intestines over her shoulder.  The film does not even suggest this happened, beyond the idea that organs have been removed.  Second, the night the Ripper claimed two victims, most Ripperologists have surmised that because he was interrupted when he killed Liz Stride, he was really angry when he killed Catherine Eddowes, since he hacked away the bottom half of her face.  But when her face is revealed it is just the same as the other victims.  Finally, when the doctor begins to describe the final body--usual the very words of the actual report--he stops after having described the position of the corpse.  More to the point, he stops before describing what Jack did with her organs.  Believe me, you do not need to see this to freak out because just hearing about it would keep you awake all night.  Now, to be fair, the dialogue is the same as that scene in the graphic novel; but then Moore and Campbell had already devoted a entire volume to what Jack the Ripper did that night in graphic detail so it did not have to be articulated.  But I was all set to hear the one of the biggest audience moans in cinematic history and was somewhat disappointed the Hughes Brothers let everybody off the hook.<br /><br />Ironically, the Hughes Brothers could legitimately get away with showing us much more blood and guts.  After all, the autopsy reports tell us in excruciating detail what the Ripper did to each of his victims and they could simply claim historical accuracy.  But instead they pull up short, giving them even more latitude for getting away with what gore they do offer up.  However, during Abberline's vision of what will happen to Jack the Ripper's final victim, one of the images that flashes before our eyes is indeed a photograph taken by the police of the mutilated body of Mary Kelly.  This only goes to reinforce the great divide that exists between those who have studied the murders of Jack the Ripper and/or read "From Hell" and those who simply know Jack the Ripper killed a bunch of prostitutes in London in the late 19th century and was never caught.<br /><br />Certainly, the Hughes Brothers do play with us in this film.  If you can stomach seeing it a second time, or if you already know who "From Hell" contends is the Ripper, then they are several scenes were Abberline is tantalizingly close to the killer.  Of course, they are not alone in such regard; "The Bone Collector" was particularly audacious in offering us a first glimpse of the killer.  Moore and Campbell let us know the identity of Jack from before he ever starts his killing spree, but the movie version decides to keep it a mystery and apparently succeeds in surprising those who only know about "From Hell" from the trailer and television commercials.<br /><br />The Hughes Brothers have described "From Hell" as a "ghetto" film, and certainly the production design stands out in providing a fitting atmosphere for the tale.  The events we are watching are not taking place in the London we have come to know from countless Hammer horror films but in what we readily accept as the city's Whitechapel district in the fall of 1888 (with Prague doubling nicely).  This is as stylish a slasher flick as you will ever see, with the time-lapse sequence of the discovery of one of the bodies and the revelation of the Masonic meeting beneath the streets of London particularly memorable.  Even the lighting works towards the proper atmosphere for the story.<br /><br />Johnny Depp's performance as Inspector Abberline is nicely understated (the character's psychic visions come from a fake psychic who was in the graphic novel).  Unfortunately, Heather Graham is just too darn cute, sticking out from the rest of the totally believable group of prostitutes (Annabelle Apsion, Katrin Cartlidge, Susan Lynch and Lesley Sharp).  I had heard that the producers made actually made them shoot a "happy ending" to this film, but fortunately they had the wisdom not to use it.  Ripperologists knew going in that this was not going to be the "true" story about Jack, so that additional liberties such as all of the victims hanging out together all the time and the total absence of men in any of their lives, are easily forgivable.  What was always impressive about Moore's tale was how he managed to weave so many different elements together into a comprehensive tale, even if it is ultimately suspect.  But the film version strips the story down to its essentials and while it is certainly the best Jack the Ripper film made to date, I cannot shake my head and think how much better it could have been by letting the audience glimpse just a little bit more of the true story.<br /><br />But, oh, boys and girls, "From Hell" could have upset you a whole lot more than it did.  If only you can understand how close to the edge of the cliff you were on this one...</p></body></html>

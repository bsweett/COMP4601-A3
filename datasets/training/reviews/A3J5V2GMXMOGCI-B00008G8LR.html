<meta name="summary" content="Fox tries to satisfy everyone with this latest release of PREDATOR"></head><body><p>For those that like the film-like quality of their prints re-calibrated and compromised to look "cleaner" for smaller high-definition TVs (under 50 inches), then this new, extras-added, version of PREDATOR will be satisfactory.<br />The original Blu-Ray, without the extras, looks much more like the theatrical release prints, so purists should hang on to that version.<br />This new version has the rather lackluster extras, and questionable internet options, that adolescents who watch movies in cars and on computers probably crave, but if you project PREDATOR on a large (65 inches and over) home-theater screen, then there's no need to spend any more money on a newer version.</p></body></html>

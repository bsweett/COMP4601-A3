<meta name="summary" content="The Frat Nazis On Top  ( * * *  1/2 )"></head><body><p>It's not that I don't believe that every single one of the incidents in W. didn't take place, it's just that Oliver Stone discredits himself by making Bush 43 look SO unrelievedly puerile and SO utterly incompetent that Bush almost gains the viewer's sympathy---a difficult feat, considering that Dubya had to be most inept and unfit man ever to sit in the Oval Office, at least since James Buchanan.<br /><br />Stone's "Junior" starts out life as a drunken frat boy who is constantly bailed out of trouble by his supercompetent Daddy, and Junior largely remains that kid all his life, except for the fact that he quits drinking somewhere along the way. Regardless of going dry, W.'s mind never sharpens. He never truly matures and he never adopts a measure of success other than that of his own advancement. By his own lights, Stone's George W. Bush is the most phenomenally successful man in the world. And I'm sure that's true in real life, anyway.<br /><br />Unfortunately for America, Bush's dream job was to be the Commissioner of Baseball, not the Commander-in-Chief. He runs his White House and manages his foreign policy with all the subtlety of Leo Durocher and Billy Martin's three-headed love child.<br /><br />Bush's Administration is the hideout of cultured barbarians and frat Nazis whose main focus in life seems to be keeping themselves the main focus of everything. Surrounding himself with smarter sycophants like Karl Rove and Dick Cheney (whom he calls "Vice" rather than "Dick," as if it matters), Bush sets his compass by that most egotistical of lodestones---What God wants. It's incredible how well W. knows just what God wants, considering he's never even seen the Guy.<br /><br />With no intellectual curiosity and little real intellect, Stone's W. is a frightening nitwit who has his hand on The Button. Whether the real one is less of a nincompoop, Oliver Stone has set the biofilm benchmark on this President so low that the film adaptation of Bush's seemingly-eventual War Crimes Trial will show him in a better light.<br /><br />That's tough to do.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Kubrick's Vivid Universe"></head><body><p>Stanley Kubrick had the ability of always taking his viewers on a fantastic ride. He created new worlds for us to see,and this film is no  exception. But one of the problems with this film and other works of art  is,it's not accessible to everyone. Many will be turned off by the film. I  almost was myself. This is not an easy film to watch due to the intense  images you see. But if you just hold it out,you'll find that you'll  actually enjoy this picture.  Astonishing production designs and costume  designs. Everything about this film grabs your attention. Everything you  see will stay with you long after you've watched this movie. I personally  know,they're many things about this movie I'll never forget. Not Kubrick's  best,but one every Kubrick fan should see,and not to mention filmbuffs. As  with other Kubrick films,this one is a visual work of art.</p></body></html>

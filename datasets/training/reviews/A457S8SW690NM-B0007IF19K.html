I preferred Hotel Rwanda a lot more and I felt that Don Cheadle should have won the best actor oscar. Jamie Foxx did a very good job but I found Don Cheadle to have done better. If you want to watch a true masterpiece, then watch Hotel Rwanda.<br /><br />But, Ray is a good movie that everyone should see. It portrays Ray Charles's life and showed his many dark secrets. I never knew that he had been like that. He didn't save his brother from death, cheated on his wife, then on the lady who he was cheating with and used many drugs. The movie is hard to watch at times and Jamie Foxx's performance is amazing. It shows all of the downfalls of Ray Charles and his whole life. The movie is also very informative as it informs you on everything in his life. It's kind of like a documentary in a movie form. I find it to be worth a definite rent but I recommend Hotel Rwanda over it. Nevertheless, both are excellent movies, and the performances by Jamie Foxx and Don Cheadle are both remarquable.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="More funny then scary a waste of time really stupid"></head><body><p>With the succes of the remake of Dawn of the dead, and the modest hits 28 days later, resident evil and shawn of the dead Gearoge A Ramano thought why not make some cash while zombie movies are popouler. Well that's what he did made a really bad cheap horror movie with B actors. When relesed it went out of theaters so fast. The story is so bad it dosent make sense. I found it more funny then scary. overall dont waste your time with this trash.</p></body></html>

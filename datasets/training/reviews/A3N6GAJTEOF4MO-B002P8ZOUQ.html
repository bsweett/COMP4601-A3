He's one of the original anti-heroes and is revered worldwide as an all out badass of ridiculous proportion. Apart from in a recent series of comics, the origins of the Wolverine character have never really been discussed so a movie about those origins I can imagine was a bit of a surprise for fans when it was announced. The real question being, just how are they going to take on the origins of such a complex character in the Marvel universe? Let's be honest it wasn't going to be an easy task. This film acts not just as a prequel to the X-Men trilogy of films but also as a stand alone film to give the fans of the X-Men films an idea of the history of this character and just how exactly he came to be.<br /><br />Starting off in 1845 a young James Howlett witnesses the murder of his father by groundskeeper Thomas Logan. Shocked and angry, James' mutation (bone claws) is activated and he attacks and kills Logan. With his last breath Logan reveals that he is James' biological father. James flees the home with Logan's abused son Victor Creed and they both promise each other that they will always have each others back. Fast forward to when they are adults and they are approached by a young William Stryker who offers them a chance to join Team X. The brothers join but soon their questionable actions cause James to leave the group.<br /><br />6 years later, James is now known as Logan and is living with his girlfriend in Canada. He is approached by Stryker who warns him that someone is killing off each member of the original team. Victor is the one killing off the members and he is the one that kills Logan's girlfriend leading them into a brutal sibling rivalry. Stryker offers Logan a way of defeating Creed, joining the weapon X programme which will reinforce Logan's bones with the indestructible Adamantium. When Stryker attempts to wipe Logan's memory during the procedure Logan breaks free and vows to take revenge on Stryker and Victor. Logan needs to find Stryker's hidden laboratory known as "The Island" and he must enlist the help of the famous X-Man, Remy LeBeau (Gambit).<br /><br />The characters in the film are a very welcome additional fantasy and comic element to the X-Men movie universe. In the X films the characters, although maintaining the fantasy element, were a bit too serious for their own good. In this, in my opinion, they have taken on a more comic book element similar to the newest comic book movies such as Incredible Hulk and Iron Man. The characters don't take themselves too seriously which, in a film like this, is always a good thing. Hugh Jackman reprises his role as Wolverine and although I did enjoy him in the X-Men films, I found he struggled slightly to keep my interest in the character for the entirety of the film.  Liev Schreiber as Victor Creed (Sabretooth to the comic fans) was an inspired choice and I have to say a much preferred one to Tyler Mane who played the character in the X-Men movies. They both had a fantastic chemistry together during their fight scenes and general acting together. The brotherhood seems believable and it makes the film work when they are beating the hell out of each other.<br /><br />The other interesting characters that made this film work wonders are mainly the ones involved in Team X mainly displayed at the start of the film and, of course, the legendary Gambit. Ryan Reynolds made this film an enjoyable and light hearted piece of work as the character Wade Wilson or Deadpool to others. The funny one liners and general character demeanour made me wonder why Reynolds didn't have a larger part to play in the film as a whole. I can't help but think that the film would have been a bigger success in terms of critical ratings had he obtained a higher prominence in the film. Taylor Kitsch as Gambit achieves his goal of portraying the coolness of the character well, but doesn't match up to the brilliance of the comic interpretation. The young William Stryker played by Danny Huston isn't as intimidating as his X2 predecessor, Brian Cox, but does manage to play the manipulative role quite well.<br /><br />Some of the settings really don't work as well as you would think. A lot of the indoor sets look like the sets from what you would imagine to see in a cheap independent film. The special effects when used to their fullest extent work well but other times fell short (see the initial back alley fight between Logan & Gambit) and come across as if they were done at the last minute. The fight choreography between the two brothers is at times flawless and the best example of a great fighting scene is during the end of the movie which I wont reveal anything about as it's a must see.<br /><br />The film wasn't great. In fact the majority of the plot and dialogue was quite poor but my attention was brought back when the cool action would take place. Ryan Reynolds could have saved this film had his character been given a more prominent role throughout. The effects and settings work where they're supposed to but do fall flat at some points during the film. Jackman is a good choice as the Wolverine character, but he struggled slightly to hold the whole film as the character. We all learn from experience and where this film fell down may be repaired. A Sequel is apparently in the works and although we didn't see it in this instalment I do hope that we do, at some point, see Jackman put on the famous Blue & Yellow suit.</p></body></html>

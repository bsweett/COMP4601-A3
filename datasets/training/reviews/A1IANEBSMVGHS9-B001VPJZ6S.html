<meta name="summary" content="Now I know why this is a classic"></head><body><p>I guess I was locked out in a cave, because in spite of having graduated from high school in 1989, today I saw "The Breakfast Club" for the first time. Laugh if you may, but I guess this opinion from an eighties child who is now 33 years old may help you decide to watch it too.<br /><br />The movie is now over twenty years old, and it doesn't feel old. The first half hour or so, you may feel like you're watching a teenage movie, but the plot thickens a bit as it evolves and the definite personalities of the five characters float to the surface, baring their souls to each other and the viewer. You will find yourself finding one (or more) of them with whom you will be able to identify with. In my case it was Brian (the nerd), but you may find you had more in common with the ones depicting the athlete, the basket case, the princess or the criminal.<br /><br />The performances are all extraordinary, but the true standouts were Emilio Estevez (the athlete) and Judd Nelson (the criminal), who were perfect for their roles and delivered some of the best lines overall. Now I know why this is a classic.</p></body></html>

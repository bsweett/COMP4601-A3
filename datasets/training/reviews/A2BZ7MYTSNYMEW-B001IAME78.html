<meta name="summary" content="HULK SMASH!"></head><body><p>If you enjoy a wonderful sequel to a classic movie and TV show, you will enjoy this the latest installment of the Incredible Hulk. There are a few changes in this latest movie...Liv Tyler now plays the love interest; William Hurt plays the General; and Edward Norton now plays the tortured Dr. Bruce Banner. There is the same old theme of a tormented Dr. Banner trying to cure himself (i.e., by using calming techniques taught to him and by sending data to a professor at the University) while trying to elude his nemesis General Ross (who is still trying to capture and control the Hulk), and rekindling a romance with Betty (Ross' daughter). The new additions to the story is the angry, power hungry soldier, Emil Blonsky who Ross' is willing to experiment on to insure that he has someone who can rival the Hulk. Blonsky doesn't mind being experimented on if it means that he will have super strength. He feels the power already.<br /><br />While there are some cheesy moments (cameos of both a deceased Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno, not to mention the creator of Marvel Comics), over all I think this movie was extremely enjoyable, and I think Norton ended up being a decent Hulk. He definitely looks and acts tortured. And the lesson is clear, you can continue to fight the rage inside you or you can learn to control and use it. But more importantly, the movie sets the tone for future Hulk movies and future storylines...the Doctor helping Banner I think could be the Doctor with the large cranium from the comic books/cartoons, not to mention Banner's continued search for a cure. Or maybe at least we will discover if Banner ever learns to control his beast.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Johnny Depp is magical"></head><body><p>Sleepy Hollow is a pretty cool movie. Tim Burton created a spooky and dreary little world and picked Johnny Depp to play lead. You really can't go wrong. The Headless Horseman myth has always fascinated me so I was delighted to watch Burton's take on the legend. Its great because this movie has just the right amount of elements. Its mysterious, its spooky and thilling, its subtle and romantic too and its even a comedy. Of course, this isn't to be taken seriously, and its really not a scary film whatsoever, but it is a fun film. I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. Its a really good 'popcorn flick'.</p></body></html>

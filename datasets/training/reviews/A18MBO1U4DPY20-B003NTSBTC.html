Di Caprio is good at first but soon you will find the movie goes into a very sketchy study of schizophrenia, war, guns, dark walls, island, revenge and disappearing acts in 1954.<br /><br />Let's talk about the director. Having done just about every sort of classic, Martin Scorsese seems to have made Shutter Island as a homage to Kubrick and Hitchcock. I read somewhere that this is a bit like a modern day shining. I beg to differ, The Shining had a good story while Shutter Island tries very hard to confuse and make sense at the same time. Some people might have even guessed the mystery, some people like me would have waited till the last scene only to be told something that would make sense but still seem a little lofty.<br /><br />Leonardo is Martin's favourite actor without a doubt. They have always made a great team but with Shutter Island, I found myself a little disappointed because it left me feeling a little robbed of a worthy end. The climax leaves too many things unanswered. I fear this movie is terribly slow and difficult to be watched at home so I'm glad I went to the movies. BEWARE of the loud pangs of horns and music that will hit you time and again, every time an ocean shot is shown.<br /><br />Gandhi, I'm sorry, Sir Ben Kingseley was a relief with a very clean little important role. The names will confuse you no end. Mark Ruffalo has done better films but I found his character quite meak though he gave it his best shot. From start to finish, the film centers around Di Caprio. He's in every single scene.<br /><br />What I liked about this film is how despite being slow it holds you by the end of your brain's wits. You will forget your life for that 2 hours and 30 minutes, you will switch your blackberry off and not want to speak a word to anyone. That disconnect truly highlights Scorsese's great potential for drama.<br /><br />This film is definitely beyond the attention span of my generation.</p></body></html>

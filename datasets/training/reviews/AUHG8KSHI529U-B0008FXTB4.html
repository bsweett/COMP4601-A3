<meta name="summary" content="Not in the same hemisphere as Get Shorty, but a decent rental entertainment"></head><body><p>This movie suffers a bit because it is a sequel to the very much better film, "Get Shorty".  I know that some hate this film and for a variety of good reasons.  However, this movie is not nearly as bad as some have claimed.  There are a few really good scenes, a number that really work nicely, and then there is that crummy dance scene.  Without that (or a shorter version of it), this would have been much more likeable.  It just goes on too long and adds nothing much to the film.<br /><br />The Rock gives a very engaging performance as the bodyguard who is gay, but doesn't quite seem to admit it to himself.  Vince Vaughn does a pretty good job with a despicable character.  When I see Robert Pastorelli on screen I am still upset that he killed himself with an overdose.  Cedric the Entertainer and his Gangsta Crew also add quite a bit to the story as do the Russians.  Harvey Keitel seemed to be phoning it in a bit.  Uma is good, but doesn't glow here.  And Chili Palmer is just fun to watch on the screen, so you gotta like Travolta for giving the character life.<br /><br />So, not a great film.  Not even a very good one.  But it is an ok rental entertainment.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="REVIEW FOR BOX SET ONLY! GREAT FILM DEFACED!"></head><body><p>I bought the E.T. Box set at a reduced price recently because I refused to buy the altered version of the film! THIS HAS GOT TO STOP AND STOP NOW! Where do we draw the line? Are we gong to do CGI over the original "King Kong"? Are we going to color Hattie McDaniels's skin color white in "Gone With The Wind"? It is getting ridiculous what we are putting up with! People need to get over themselvies and stop being so sensitive. I just watched the Godfather trilogy and I'm Italian American! Am I complaining that Italians are protrayed as Gangsters? No! We could go back and forth all day talking about this, but in short....let things stay intact! No altering films or art etc., whether its a classic or not! It is what it is! OK?????? Ahhhh I feel slightly better now! The original film E.T is a wonderful film that seemed even better than I remembered. The DVD transfer looks great and the audio was really surprisingly good! The is an excellent film, but look for the gift set cheap. AVOID THE SINGLE DISC LIKE THE PLAGUE!</p></body></html>

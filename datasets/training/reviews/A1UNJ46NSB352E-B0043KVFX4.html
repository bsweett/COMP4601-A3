<meta name="summary" content="Not a bad third entry"></head><body><p>Considering the Resident Evil movie universe, this third entry into the series is probably on par with the first movie, if not better.  I know many people aren't fans of this series, but I do get a kick out of them.  I thought the second one was a bit of a disappointment, but the series came back with Extinction.  Alice is back, along with a couple of characters from Apocalypse.  Humanity is on the brink of extinction now as the virus continues to grow and grow.  As has been mentioned in other reviews, this is not exactly a unique take, but where else would they go with it?  If you like the Resident Evil movies, definitely check this one out.  If you didn't like the first one, you should probably steer clear.</p></body></html>

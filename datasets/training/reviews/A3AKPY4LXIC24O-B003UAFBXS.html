<meta name="summary" content="&quot;Like a pigeon having a heart attack&quot;"></head><body><p>&quot;What the Hell?&quot;  That's pretty much the standard response when confronted with the premise for this film.  Elvis, who switched places with an impersonator, didn't die like we've all been led to believe.  He's been living out the last of his days at the Mud Creek Shady Rest Convalesence Home, worrying about a growth on a very private part of his anatomy and stewing in regret.  One of his fellow boarders is a black man convinced that he's JFK.  That weird enough for you?  Ok, well then, how 'bout adding a soul sucking mummy taking advantage of the weak prey provided by the rest home?  Still not weird enough?  Well then, picture a geriatric Elvis, using a walker, fighting aforementioned mummy.  Pretty darn weird.  It is, I'll admit it, and the fact that this film was made in any capacity is a testament not only to the draw of Bruce Campbell but also the genius of Don Coscarelli (of Phantasm fame).  The audience for this type of movie is, to put it nicely, select.  I think the idea was to pick the oddest Joe Lansdale story (which can be found in his brilliant collection Writer of the Purple Rage) and see if any financial backer would bite. Getting any money for this project must have been a chore in itself.  One of the reasons I liked this movie so much was that it just seemed so Corman-esque in nature, like it was made just for the hell of it.  To make a movie, not for critics, not for blockbuster profit, but for fans of the off-the wall.  If you like comedy, horror, drama, and poorly lit spanish soap operas this film should appeal to you in some way.  <p>The biggest surprise was Bruce Campbell's performance, not that it was good (that's a frickin' given) but that it was so restrained.  The most manic you will see ol' BC is during a fight with an extremely fake scarab beetle in his bedroom and even that isn't all that manic.  It makes me wonder why a guy of this level of talent isn't making more movies, but then I remember Hollywood is evil and move on.  <p>The movie isn't so much a horror tale (the scariest part is the idea of being left to die in a rest home) but a story of doing what's right, not matter how bizarre.  So don't look for the Evil Dead, take it for what it is ( a low budget horror movie with a character focus), laugh at the hilarious premise and enjoy.  Hopefully this will lead to more adaptations of Lansdale's work, especially The Drive-In and The Bottoms.</p></body></html>

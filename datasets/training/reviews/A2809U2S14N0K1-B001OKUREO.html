<meta name="summary" content="Silly and corny"></head><body><p>I have seen George W. Bush on TV many times but I confess I knew little about him. Watching this movie, I do not feel that I have learned much about him or what drives him. I could not even identify the character I have seen on TV with the actor. I then read up on George W. Bush in the Wikipedia and I do not think that this movie is a fair representation of the man.<br /><br />The acting itself is not particular good. No character struck me as playing particularly good except for Toby Jones.<br /><br />The filming was only ordinary.</p></body></html>

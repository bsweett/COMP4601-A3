<meta name="summary" content="Smells a Little Like a Set-Up"></head><body><p>This is a somewhat interesting movie, although a little too pat in places. It's almost as if Eastwood placed himself at a carnival shooting gallery, with the bad guys popping up at predictable intervals for him to shoot down. The gang of hooligan Hmong teens pop up to try to roust their cousin to join their gang. Then they pop up to roust the young female teen in the family. As in Death Wish, there almost seem to be too many timed gang threats for the lead character to prove himself against.<br /><br />Then Eastwood's film children pop up in predictable, self-seeking fashion to urge him into the dullness of a retirement home. He shoots down these threats in turn - not with a gun this time, but verbally.<br /><br />There is also a certain predictability to the character that Eastwood plays. He is the gruff Archie Bunker bigot with a heart of gold. However, he does evolve, albeit again, a little too neatly on cue.<br /><br />But the film ultimately takes the viewer to some interesting places. And we learn something about the Hmong culture along the way. The Hmong are a group of Southeast Asian hill people whose story has rarely been told on the screen.<br /><br />There is no Director's commentary on this DVD, but there are a couple of bonus features centering on the 1972 Gran Torino that's the star of this film, and on classic muscle cars in general. Some of the men involved in the making of this movie and some others reminisce about their first cars and their dream cars. We get to see a Detroit rally of classic cars along Woodward Avenue in the process - an especially poignant parade since the Detroit scene has so altered in the months since this movie was released.<br /><br />With all these elements - insight into Hmong culture, classic cars, and a new dimension to classic Eastwood toughness - there are a number of reasons to check out this DVD.</p></body></html>

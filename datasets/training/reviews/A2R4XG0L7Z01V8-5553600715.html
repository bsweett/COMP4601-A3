It looks more to be set in the Yorkshire moors, but in reality it was set in Spain! Of course.<p>I'm not sure what I was expecting of this movie. When it started, it reminded me very much of Sixth Sense, and very much of M. Night Shyamalan's camera work, rather than Alejandro Amenabar. (Try saying THAT when you've had a few) As it went on, the whole fog outside the house, and not being able to escape the house/gardens reminded me of Beetlejuice - and again, the Yorkshire moors.<p>Unfortunately (no thanks to a Scottish newspaper) I found out the twist at the end, so I was expecting it, although it wasn't quite what I expected! So at least that was something.<p>I actually wondered after this movie was finished - and after finishing the discussion about what I didn't understand - how much of it was based on real life. As it was set towards the end of World War II, there were many wives wondering if they would see their husbands again - presuming they hadn't already received a telegram saying they were missing. How many wives would subsequently go mad, upon being trapped alone with children, without family around, and the fear of not being able to remarry? (Amazon, I am NOT giving anything away, so do not even start with me!) How many children had to put up with an overbearing, overprotective mother, while wishing they could see their father, and not understanding why he had to go and maybe not come back? Or wishing they could go out in the sunshine?<p>I must say, Nicole Kidman came off very well as a 40s wife - right down to the hairstyle, clothes, and manner. (Although I did find the hairstyle was a little too harsh) She was terrific as Grace, and had great chemistry with the children - although the girl was a little witch at times!<p>What didn't I get about this movie? The servants - how they couldn't come through the door, even after it was explained what they really were, but I suppose that's just too cartoonish maybe? - and the father coming back from the war. What was the point in Christopher Eccleston appearing in the movie for no apparent reason? But you could dig deeper into his whole appearing/disappearing act - and I could, but Amazon would get their red pen out. And I know he's come back from the war and everything, and he's seen some horrific things which he didn't want to talk about, but he could have at least given his wife a kiss! (In this day and age, I probably would have pounced on him, but this is in the 40s) But what I want to know is: did he remove the curtains?! Or did the servants? I found the mute servant's reason for being mute very strange. Surely if it happened to her, it could have happened to the rest of them, after they &quot;found out&quot;.<p>The finale is terrific, and in the scenes leading up to it, I was really, really scared, and looking for someone to hold on to! (A friendly cushion kept me comforted kind of) After the film has finished, you look back on the film in a different light. Although I'll have to re-watch it many times before I get all the clues. <p>As a final note: don't be surprised if the sound isn't that great. I had this turned right up, and I still could only just hear what Nicole was saying. I thought this was a problem with my hearing. But I've read in other reviews, that people have had problems with the sound. So at least it's not me!</p></body></html>

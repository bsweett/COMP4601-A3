<meta name="summary" content="A grim fantasy for adults only"></head><body><p>Easily the most depressing film of last year.  Stunning set and creature design abound in this bleak story set in Spain, 1944.  Remarkable acting from young Ivana Baquero as a girl who must contend with her pregnant mother's illness, her military stepfather's cruelty  towards the peasant revolutionaries, and her own interior world of magic realism/fantasy, involving creatures who send her on increasingly dangerous missions to perform certain tasks before the moon is full.  This is NOT something to watch with the kiddos!</p></body></html>

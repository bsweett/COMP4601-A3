The problem is that the longer it takes the more likely she will end up becoming one of them.  John Wayne's character of Ethan Edwards struggles over the five year seach between his hate of the Indians and his love of his family.  This movie has few good guys and no real bad guys.  Everybody seems to have a dark and bloody history behind their character.  The humor, used with a light touch, keeps the film from getting too depressing.<br /><br />Like in the Shootist, another film I enjoy, John Wayne is not playing a John Wayne character.  His character, in fact, seems to fall apart as the search continues.<br /><br />This Disc set had commentary by Peter Bogdanovich who does a great job, along with two features on the movie and Behind The Cameras segments from Warner Brothers Presents TV series.  It seems John Ford decided to film what was happening behind the cameras at the same time he was making the film.  This makes for great extras from a film product made before the age of DVDS.</p></body></html>

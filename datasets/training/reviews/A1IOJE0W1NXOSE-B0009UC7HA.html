(Don't even ask how this could happen!)  He borrows his boss's boat and aided by his faithful sidekick (played perfectly by Steve Zahn) he sets out on his search.  Coincidentally he crosses paths with a beautiful doctor from the World Health Organization (Penelope Cruz) and soon her quest to find the source of a mysterious disease combines with his search for the boat.  This movie is totally predictable, but it is slick and quite entertaining.  If you're not in search of great art, but are looking for an action and adventure-filled evening of entertainment, this just might fit the bill.</p></body></html>

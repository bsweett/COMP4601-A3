<meta name="summary" content="Musical Champagne"></head><body><p>A bubbly and fun musical with lighthearted songs and great cast.  Who would have thought Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan could carry a tune and put themselves so totally into a lighthearted musical?  It works!<br /><br />If you want something happy and full of energy and jumping dance music it is a good movie to watch.<br /><br />The music is from the Swedish Rock Group, "Abba"  - and although "campy" it is fresh and vibrant again in this romantic scenario.<br /><br />Sophie, a young girl is about to be married.  (Sophie is played by Amanda Seyfried.)  She lives on a beautiful Greek island with her mother, Donna (Streep).  Together they work hard to keep up a run-down resort.  They are preparing for Sophie's wedding and Sophie feels the need to know who her real father is, and wants him with her during this special time.  She had read her mother's diary and there were three possibilities on who her father is.  She invites each to attend her wedding without her mother's knowledge.<br /><br />Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Harry (Colin Firth), and Bill (Stellan Skarsgard) all arrive on the same boat.<br /><br />Donna finds out they are at her resort and is absolutely shocked to meet her old lovers again after 20 years have patched.  Her two best friends, Tanya (Christine Baranaki) and Rosie (Julia Walters), for their advice and help on how to get through the next few days.  Sophie finds time to be with the three men and looks for clues on who her real dad is.  Again, the unexpected surprise is Streep, Brosman and even Christine Baranski - singing and having fun with this romantic romp.  No matter how schmaltzy Abba can be it is just a "sparkly"  time for all.</p></body></html>

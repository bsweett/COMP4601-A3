For one thing, it fails to focus on the Elizabeth Short story.<br /><br />For all the rich texture of the monochromatic cinematography (so we'd know we're watching a modern film noir), all the posturing of SCARLETT JOHANSSON with her long cigarette holder, all the fake glamor of HILARY SWANK, and all the convoluted plot lines, it's hard to find a trace of the Elizabeth Short story here. And that's the film's main problem. Her story is really just background filler for some very complicated fictional characters and situations that exist outside the story of THE BLACK DAHLIA, a murder never actually solved.<br /><br />While watching it unfold, I couldn't help thinking how much better this would have been as a gritty film noir back in the '40s in the sort of shimmering B&W photography that Michael Curtiz used for THE UNSUSPECTED--and with an actor like Humphrey Bogart as the lead detective with either Lauren Bacall or Lizabeth Scott as the femme fatale. And if they needed a brunette siren they could always use Marie Windsor. Hilary Swank really has done much better work elsewhere.<br /><br />Furthermore, the story chosen from the James Elroy novel which does give a solution to the crime, is an absurd one that is not made even remotely believable by the creation of the Fiona Shaw character who seems to be existing in another movie--a farce. Nor is the narration spoken by Josh Hartnett--in a monotone that I found alienating--any help in explaining the twisted course of events.<br /><br />DePalma missed the opportunity in bringing the Elizabeth Short story to the screen as stark drama in any way that makes sense. Because of its assured style, it's a very watchable film despite all the flaws--and you keep hoping something better will happen in the last thirty minutes to explain motives and to close in on the final chapter of Short's life, but no--no such luck. It fizzles to an artificial conclusion dreamed up by author Elroy. Alas, even Mark Isham's bombastic score doesn't work although it sounds good over the closing credits.<br /><br />It's a classic example of style over substance, but this time the style can't hide the fact that the script is largely incomprehensible and goes far astray of its subject matter instead of keeping a narrow focus on the actual story.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Best Movie Of All Time.  End of Story."></head><body><p>This is by far the greatest movie ever made, unquestionably.  If you dont like this movie, then im sorry you are just a moron, who wouldnt know entertainment if it bite them on the a$$.  The story can't be beat, its deep, dramatic, emotional, and inspiring.  The action is intense, realistic, and brutal, which matches the story perfectly.  The performances are some of the greatest in cinema history, i cannot believe Mel didnt get the best actor oscar, they need to give him one for this movie.  He did get one for directing though which i couldnt agree with more, he is one of the best directors out there.  This is definetly a 10 out of a 10, how could anyone think otherwise.</p></body></html>

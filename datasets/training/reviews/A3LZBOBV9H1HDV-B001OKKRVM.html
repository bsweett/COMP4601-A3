The directing by Luc Jacquet is excellent. The narration performed by Morgan Freeman and written by Jordan Roberts is excellent. The story by Jacquet & the screenplay by Jacquet & Michael Fessler is excellent. The music by Alex Wurman is impressive! The cinematography by Laurent Chalet & Jerome Maison is excellent! The film editing by Sabine Emiliani is excellent. This is one of the best documentaries in recent history and of all time, I personally think. It is now an Oscar winner for Best Documentary Feature for 2005.</p></body></html>

It starts out gently enough, quickly shifting into an all-out frenzy of murderous insanity! This extreme level of intensity doesn't let up, so don't expect any comedy or romantic breaks here! The basic plot has been well covered elsewhere. I'll just say that it only serves to give a narrative skeleton to hang the visceral shocks and thrills on. There are many memorable scenes that are best seen without prior warning. No spoilers! The stalker / killer is perfectly evil and relentlessly driven. As for the "twist" ending, I found it to be a true jaw-dropper, in the SAW (the first one) sense. I've watched HT several times now, and the clues are there if you pay close attention to the characters' actions and words. This movie left me w/ my thrill addiction satisfied, and my horror itch well scratched. Highly recommended...</p></body></html>

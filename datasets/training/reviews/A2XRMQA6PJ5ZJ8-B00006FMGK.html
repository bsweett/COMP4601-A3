<meta name="summary" content="Middle of the road Star Treg TNG film"></head><body><p>"Nemesis" is heavy on action, light on plot, almost the exact opposite of "First Contact" which is my favorite Star Trek movie. However, this is a watchable film, and the movie certainly highlights the fact that by now the TNG characters all have wonderful chemistry with one another, and some of the characters' acting skills have greatly improved since the inception of the series. Patrick Stewart (whose acting skills have always been excellent in my opinion) turns in a bravo performance, as does Brent Spiner. The "dune buggy" scenes in the desert are lots of fun. However, how does this segment of the film square with the "Prime Directive?" I suppose we are destined never to know, but that's Hollywood. This is a minor quibble.<br /><br />My main criticism of the movie is that I found the plot to be murky and the evil protagonist somewhat unfocused as regards his motivations and purpose. I also don't like the idea of "good Romulans" (spoiler omitted here). The best thing about the film is that it deals with the Romulans/Remans who I have always thought are the best "Star Trek" villains with the possible exception of the Borg.<br /><br />If you are a Star Trek fan, you will like this movie. Those who are not will likely be less enthusiastic. RJB.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing not to see it in 3D"></head><body><p>I'm sure it will be on at a local cinema again soon. My boyfriend thankfully saw it at the cinema in 3D, and explained why the credits and everything else seems to come towards the camera at random points in the film. However, it does work well in 2D, but it still would have been good to see it in 3D. There's some gory scenes that would have had you ducking in your seat.<br /><br />As much as I liked Friday 13 III, there are a few similarities to the previous movies. Able (the old man near the beginning) is much like Crazy Ralph from the first two films. It's a shame he only had a small part, cos Crazy Ralph's part was extended. Some of the other similar scenes include: Debbie seeing drops of blood falling from above, she looks up and a knife goes through her throat, almost exactly the same as Kevin Bacon's scene in the first film; after Chris thinks she had killed Jason she goes to sleep in a canoe on the lake much like Alice did in the first film; and when Chris awakes from the canoe Mrs. Voorhees comes out of the water and drags her under water much like what Jason did to Alice in Part 1.<br /><br />You actually see Jason smiling in this film, which is quite freaky. I didn't feel as sorry for him in this film as I did in the last (with his mother), but there are a couple of odd bits, which I ended up thinking about. I'm not sure whether my boyfriend gave me this impression, or the film did, but there is the idea that the reason why Jason didn't kill Chris is because she passed out, so he decided to rape her. And her parents never told her what happened while she was out. But I just don't think Jason has the mental capability to rape someone. Considering how young he "died", he probably didn't know about the "birds & the bees" then. But then my boyfriend thinks he did rape her. It's one of those puzzling aspects of this movie.<br /><br />The other puzzling thing about this movie (which I JUST worked out - how blonde am I?) is it's Friday 13th part 3 - but it's not actually SET on a Friday 13th. It actually takes place the day after the events of Part 2, making it Saturday the 14th. While the beginning of the movie takes place on the evening of Saturday the 14th, when the overweight store owner and his nagging wife are killed, the majority of the movie takes place on the following day, making it Sunday the 15th.<br /><br />From various reviews, I've heard this is the last "good" Friday 13th movie. (Apart from Freddy vs Jason, is that included?) If that's the case, I still have the rest to watch! The only thing I wasn't keen on in this was the recap from the previous Friday 13th. Yes, it's always good to have a little reminder, but at this point, you just want to get on with the new film. Hopefully, the rest of the movies won't be as bad as everyone says they are.</p></body></html>

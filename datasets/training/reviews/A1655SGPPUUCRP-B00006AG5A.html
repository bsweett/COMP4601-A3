<meta name="summary" content="Oddly charming and surprisingly enjoyable"></head><body><p>I went into "The Scorpion King" with pretty low expectations.  Being a lover of the first two "Mummy" films, I was terribly disappointed, like many, to learn that the next film in the series would be a prequel and not involve the usual charming cast of Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz.  I also went in expecting The Rock to be boring, cheesy, and annoying.  It seemed to me that "The Scorpion King" would serve one purpose, to show off The Rock's fighting ability (like we don't know already).<p>Boy was I wrong!  "The Scorpion King" turned out to be a top quality action flick!  It was funny and filled with plenty of the witty humor that made "The Mummy" and "The Mummy Returns" such enjoyable films.  The story was actually quite exciting and involving, quite the opposite of what I expected!<p>Believe it or not, The Rock was oddly charming in his role as Mathayus, The Scorpion King.  I actually ended up really loving him!  Mathayus's jittery sidekick, Arpid (Grant Heslov) steals the show!  Heslov is so charming and utterly hilarious, it's almost as if he was made for this role!  My only complaint as far as acting goes is that of Kelly Hu, who plays the sorceress (and Mathayus's love interest).  Her lines were cheesy to begin with, but an actress of greater talent could've delivered them with more enthusiasm and character.  <p>The movie begins rather unimpressively with Mathayus rescuing his brother from some barbaric enemies.  The fight sequence was fantastic, but what really turned me off about this scene (and made me question how good the rest of the film would be) was when Mathayus came barreling in to save his brother with his bow in hand and said "Boo" and everyone started screaming.  Come on; how cheesy and clich&eacute;d is that line?  Thank God the rest of the movie isn't like that!<p>Here's a quick summarization of the plot:<p>Mathayus is hired by a band of rebels to murder the wizard who is helping the evil Memnon win battles by seeing into the future for him.  Mathayus is set on completing his mission until he sees the wizard, who is actually the beautiful witch Cassandra.  Because of Mathayus's hesitation, Memnon's guards capture him and are about to kill him when Cassandra announces that she has had a vision and he is not to die by "Memnon's hand or any that he orders".  Yeah, right.  The movie takes off from there.<p>Yes, this movie is dumb and ridiculous, but it somehow manages to rise above that to bring us a truly enjoyable film.<p>"The Scorpion King" is short but sweet, running at a convenient 90 minutes.<p>Rated PG-13 for "intense sequences of action violence and some sensuality".  Would be acceptable for around 10 and up.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="STILL THE BEST!"></head><body><p>Many superhero/comic-book films have come to fruition since 1978, but "Superman: The Movie" still reigns as the best film of the genre. The characters from the legendary comic book come to life thanks to superb performances by a stellar cast. Christopher Reeve is still the "definitive" Superman, emphasizing his strengths while showing a bit of emotion (And not overdoing the drama, unlike Tobey Maguire in the "Spider-Whimp"...I'm sorry, "Spider-Man" movies), and his Clarke Kent is very humorous. Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman, Margot Kidder, Glenn Ford give great supporting roles that compliment Reeve brilliantly.<br /><br />Clever writing and superb directing by Richard Donner ("The Omen") enhance the film, and the great visual effects make you believe a man can fly. "Superman: The Movie" is a grand motion picture that has withstood the test of time. No matter how many superhero/comic-book films come along, this will remain the standard to which all films will strive to be, and fail. A must for "Superman" and comic-book fans!<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: A+</p></body></html>

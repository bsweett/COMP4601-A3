<meta name="summary" content="A mixed work of art, beautiful and disturbing"></head><body><p>Hero is a beautiful film. The saturated color of the costumes,autumn leaves, mountain lakes, painted deserts and palaces was superb. The martial arts scenes were amazingly directed, best described as surreal ballet in fast motion.<br /><br />The plot is interesting, changing direction three times, and thus keeping the viewers on their toes. The story is related first through the eyes of Jet Li, an assassin acting like a provincial officer. His story of the deaths of three assassins certainly has internal consistency. However the Emperor is too wise to fall for a coherent story. The Emperor then relates his suspected version of the deaths of the 3 assassins. The Emperor's story unmasks Jet Li, but the plot takes one last twist as Jet Li tell the third variation of the complicated dance of revenge, attraction, rage, and trust.<br /><br />The film left me very disturbed however in that the underlying philosophy is that the stability of the state, even a state created by a blood thirsty tyrant, is of such value that individuals must sacrifice their lives for the unity of China. Whereas this concept may be acceptable in China where the authority of the state must be preserved at all costs, is far different from the political philosophy of the United States where citizens can rebel and react against tyranny.<br /><br />The film is beautiful but in the end it is a creature of another culture and political philosophy from our own.</p></body></html>

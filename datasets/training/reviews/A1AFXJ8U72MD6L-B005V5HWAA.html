Some of the early dialogue was on the cheesy side but it picks up later.  The story is interesting but the plot points sometimes feel off.  That said, it's still good.  Probably could have been great if they had made those flaws tighter.  The angle with the daughter was a nice touch as was the wanna be dude.

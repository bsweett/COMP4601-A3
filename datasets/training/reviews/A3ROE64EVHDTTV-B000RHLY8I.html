<meta name="summary" content="Men With Golden Guns"></head><body><p>The Good Things<br />*Complex, all-encompassing story that's thrilling and interesting throughout.<br />*Very strong, thought-provoking themes (especially concerning the moral implications of gun trafficking, the corruptive nature of crime, world governments' role in worldwide violence, and many other eye-opening topics).<br />*Lots of memorable scenes and imagery that reinforce the various themes.  Good filming style.<br />*Excellent characters.  Nicholas Cage provides both witty humor and bleak moral commentary.<br />*Some parts are exceptionally detailed and realistic; it is clear that the filmmakers did their research.  Good writing.<br />*Good sound and music design.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Some themes really are convoluted, especially regarding the main character.  Even though he looses everything, he never really suffers any legal punishment and never learns from his mistakes, and continues to smuggle guns.<br />*Not sure if the film is really politically or socially accurate.<br /><br />I could summarize this as "Scarface" with guns instead of drugs, but such a comparison is really too simple.  Although Yuri (Nicholas Cage) has many of the same traits as Tonny Montanna, he is a very different character, full of wit and wisdom that contrasts with his lack of morality.  This film also differentiates itself with vivid settings (both physical and political), a strong filming style, and some very revealing themes.  This film portrays many of the problems in developing countries, and explores the issues surrounding them.  By the end of it, it leaves you bleakly pondering about the world's situation.  I would definately reccomend to everybody to at least rent this movie.</p></body></html>

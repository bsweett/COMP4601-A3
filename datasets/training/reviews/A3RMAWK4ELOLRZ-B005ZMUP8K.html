<meta name="summary" content="Pirates of the Caribbean 2: Dead Man's Chest"></head><body><p>Johnny Depp is back as Captain Jack Sparrow.  When Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) is put in prison for whatever reason, it's up to Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) to get Jack's compass to give to whoever put Elizabeth in prison in order to set her free.  Jack also needs Will's help with finding a key that will open a special treasure chest.<br /><br />"Pirates 2" has non-stop action from beginning to end, and I was at the edge of my seat watching intently.  Meet the most disgusting-looking characters (sea phantoms), such as octopus-head (I forget his name in the movie - The Dutchman, I think!), and that other guy who had a head as a saw fish.<br /><br />I recommend watching Pirates to anyone who saw the first one.  It's long, but it's worth every minute.</p></body></html>

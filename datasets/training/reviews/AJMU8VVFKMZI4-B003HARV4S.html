Kudos for the cinematopgraphy and even the film's direction.  I wasn't too fond of the pacing.  On more than one occasion, I found myself twitching in my seat and wanting everyone to get one with it.  Norton's performance was exceptional as his character carries an air of superiority throughout the film.  The overly typecast Sewell, once again don the role of the villian (I think it has something to do with his eyes-he just looks like a bastard, doesn't he?)  But the man I continue to be impressed with is Paul Giamatti.  Will someone please give this man an Oscar already.  The way this man can change his whole demeanor, his voice and delivery is absolutely amazing.  Don't believe me: Watch Sideways/Cinderella Man/ The Illusionist back to back and you'll see what I mean.  Overall: This is a film worth your time.</p></body></html>

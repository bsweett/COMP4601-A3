A few people may have forgotten that, in which case this film serves as a reminder.<br /><br />It's about people.  He starts with profiles of some folks in the US, then goes around the world, mostly staying in the background and letting the people and the facts speak for themselves.  It's just, as the title of this review might suggest, an excellent film.  That's all.</p></body></html>

And so does Director of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002NXSRX4">G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra</a> Stephen Sommers. However, whether writing, producing or directing, greatness has eluded them both. The aversion to greatness held true under their respective direction of Transformers and GI Joe.<br /><br />So who would win in a fight? Transformers RotF or GI Joe? Which movie is better? Let's break it down in an 8-point-must system.<br /><br />The fight for the better movie (7 Rounds):<br /><br />RotF story: 8<br />GI Joe story: 9<br /><br />RotF acting talent: 8<br />GI Joe acting talent: 9<br /><br />RotF action: 10<br />GI Joe action: 10<br /><br />RotF FX: 10<br />GI Joe FX: 10<br /><br />RotF Humor: 8<br />GI Joe Humor: 9<br /><br />RotF family fun factor: 10<br />GI Joe family fun factor: 10<br /><br />RotF "I wanna see it again" factor: 8<br />GI Joe "I wanna see it again" factor: 9<br /><br />Decision: RotF 62; GI Joe 66<br />Better Movie: GI Joe<br /><br />Now if The Joes and The Autobots really had to physically fight for the title, it would probably go something like this: The Transformers come right out with devastating shock and awe death and destruction against The Joes. Half of The Joes are lost in the first minute of fighting. Suddenly The Joes fire the nanotechnology-based weapon capable of eating metal and anything else that it comes into contact with. Most of The Transformers are disintegrated before they know what hit them. Out of mercy The Joes call off the nanotechnology and ask The Transformers for surrender. The Autobots agree. Above the clouds a Decepticon vows revenge on both The Joes and The Autobots.<br /><br />Winner by TKO: GI Joe<br /><br />Both movies are worth your time. Check 'em out.</p></body></html>

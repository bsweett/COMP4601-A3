<meta name="summary" content="DEATH WISH FOSTER"></head><body><p>Erica Bain (Jodie Foster) is the radio host of a pretentious program on some no doubt mind-deadening station.  Her life is great and her eyes are closed to the real horrors of the city.  But she soon has to watch her fianc&eacute; die at the hands of brutal murderers who also leave her in a coma and steal her dog.  They steal her dog!  Upon awakening, her world is rocked; she's borderline agoraphobic.<br /><br />In a situation like this, people typically do one of two things.  They either bury it deep inside, letting it burn, crippling them emotionally for years; or, they act out in a way that will help them overcome the trauma.  Erica chooses the latter option, buying a gun, becoming revitalized, and seeking a complete resolution.  Like Sally Field in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005Y1UV">Eye For An Eye</a>, I'm VERY pleased with her choice.<br /><br />From there she channels her inner Bronson and begins to clean up New York, one dirt bag at a time.<br /><br />First up, a man enters a gas station, gets angry - more than likely about the fact that the clerk had trouble scanning a debit card - and blows his top like Michael Douglas from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790742780">Falling Down</a> if you added a strong meth addiction to the picture.  Bain whips out her hand-cannon and fires from one aisle to another, through merchandise, to avenge the murder.  Clean up, aisle three!  As a follow-up she recreates my favorite scene from the Bernhard Goetz biography, and it's thoroughly satisfying.<br /><br />The transformation Bain undergoes from safety to paranoia to judge/jury/executioner is what truly makes this movie great.  Philosophical, political, emotional, physical, it's a metamorphosis in every way (similar to the 180 degree change Travis Bickle wanted for her in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767830555">Taxi Driver</a>).  She may have thought that New York was one of the safest big cities before she was attacked - something she mentioned early on - but the experience has now opened her myopic eyes.  Now, she plans on ensuring her previous misconceptions ring true.<br /><br />This is, by far, my favorite Jodie Foster performance, and her performance is absolutely mesmerizing.  Highly recommended.  I can only hope that it turns into a series of duplicates like the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000REOCSA">Death Wish Collection</a>.</p></body></html>

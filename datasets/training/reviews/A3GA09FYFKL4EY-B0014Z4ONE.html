<meta name="summary" content="Indy is still thrillin'"></head><body><p>"Raiders" is still a wild ride nearly a quarter-century after its original release. Indiana Jones, professor of archaeology, goes after the Lost Ark of the Covenant with his lost love Marian (Karen Allen) who's anything but the stereotypical damsel in distress. Marian is as tough as Indy - this tough adventuress who wins drinking contests against the best doesn't wait to be rescued but kicks behind on her own. Cheer for the heroes, hiss the nasty Nazi bad guys, and shudder over the snakes! "The Temple of Doom", while not as good as its predecessor "Raiders" created a sensation on its release since the violence was rather extreme for the usually mild Spielberg-Lucas duo. Kate Capshaw's character of Willie is a bit annoying in her whininess, but little Short Round more than makes up for her. "Last Crusade" gives us the immortal Sean Connery as Indy's staid professor father and reunites us with John Rhys-Davies and Denholm Elliott. Perhaps the best of the series, the Joneses go off for the ultimate prize - the Holy Grail! The one-liners are priceless and this set is a must-have for fans of Lucas, Spielberg, Ford and timeless, thrilling adventure as Hollywood used to make it.</p></body></html>

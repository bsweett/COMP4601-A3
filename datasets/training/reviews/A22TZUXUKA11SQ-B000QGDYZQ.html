Premonition had good intentions. I enjoyed the trailer immensely--not enough to see it in theatres--but enough to put it in my Netflix queue. After all, I enjoy Nip/Tuck and I haven't seen Julian McMahon in awhile. I would have been better off just putting N/T in the queue and getting my fix that way.<br /><br />I think you know the story. Sandra Bullock plays a woman whose husband dies in a car crash. Stunned and saddened, she goes to bed only to wake up and, whoa!, he's alive. Imagine that. Back and forth we go through a muddled story line, halfhearted acting, and a Julian McMahon who is completely unlikeable and (shudder) unattractive. What was the point? There wasn't one. That's what you need to know. I like bad movies. I own Glitter and am not ashamed. That being said, even I wouldn't own this movie. It's that bad.</p></body></html>

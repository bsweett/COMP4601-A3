If you are in love, that's great, but often it's just because someone is at least a bit intimidating.  Or very intimidating.  You find that avoiding an arguement with the person is more important than your lack of desire for doing the task.  Unless you are a total bully, we've all experienced this.  <p>"Training Day" takes this to the extreme.  Ethan Hawke is on his first day with a special police unit that he wants very much to be a member of.  He very much wants to impress Denzel Washington, the leader of the group, but encounters problems from his first minute with Washington, and they only get worse from there.  It is the nightmare that unfolds that makes this well worth seeing.  <p>Cops are not choir boys, and the terrific new series "The Shield" points this out to the extreme.  When undercover cops work with trash, some of it is bound to rub off.  And I'm sure most of us would say there would be no way we would smoke a joint laced with PCP offered from the boss, especially on the first day on the job.  But where the movie succeeds in how the Oscar-winning intimidation by Denzel Washington makes it perfectly believeable that this could happen.  <p>Once that dirty deed is done, Hawke becomes almost putty in Washington's hands, and is taken from one harrowing situation to another.  You want to believe that some good will come of it.  After all, cops need to learn how things are done to effectively get their jobs done, and this sometimes means acting less than angellic.  You want to believe that Washington overall ends justify his means.  To see if this comes to pass, catch this movie, which is not for the faint of heart.</p></body></html>

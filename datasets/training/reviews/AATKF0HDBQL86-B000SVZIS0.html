<meta name="summary" content="Okay for first-time viewers, not so good for classic fans"></head><body><p>I saw the original Planet of the Apes as a child, so I was pretty geared up to see this one.  While I won't say that I didn't enjoy it, if you're a fan of the classic film, then you might want to stick with that and give this one a pass.  For one thing, Mark Wahlberg was okay as Captain Leo Davidson, but he could have done so much more with the part.  His previous role as Bobby Shatford in The Perfect Storm proved he can act, but in this movie he was so stiff and wooden that someone could have slapped him and it wouldn't have had any effect.  Helena Bonham Carter did all right as Ari, and Michael Clarke Duncan was terrific as Attar, but other than Charlton Heston's uncredited cameo as the father of General Thade and Kris Kristofferson as Daena's father, most of the acting in this movie just left me cold.<p>My major issue with this film lies not with Tim Burton's directing--Semos knows that Burton can make a fairly decent movie every now and then, and the story in this one was okay--but with the ending.  It just came off as too contrived and hokey, and it really didn't strike me as a good way to open things up for a sequel.<p>In the end, I'll just say what I did at the start--if you're a newbie to the Planet of the Apes films, then go ahead and watch this one, but if you're a fan of the classic Apes movies, then pass this one up.</p></body></html>

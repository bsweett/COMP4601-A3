<meta name="summary" content="This is actually really GOOD!"></head><body><p>Anyone who has read my reviews knows I don't pander to crap. <p>A typical `bad'-good-guy-trying-to-clear-his-lfe flick, this film really is a fun movie to watch.First off, after The Scorpion King, I was sure The Rock's celebrity was destined to be one-dimensional. After this film, I have to admit I was wrong. He can act, he can do the tough scenes, and he can actually be funny in a long cut rather than short one-liners.  <p>From Christopher Walken cast as a Jungle Gold Slaver, to Deklan, the moronic Scottish bush pilot no one can understand, this film is filled with a deluge of characters. <p>Sean Scott is the son of a gangster, and is living in the jungles trying to find `El Gato de Diablo' a gold artifact. The Rock is a truly honest strong-arm who hates guns (&quot;Nasty things happen when I am involved with guns...&quot;), and is hired to bring him home. Seems like a typical formula film. But every character, including the jujitzu forest rebels (&quot;they are very short...&quot;) is bizarre in their own right. And there is a slew of humor in this film (my favorite is The Rock getting face-humped by a Rhesis Monkey while he's hung up in a pig-snare, and Scott is yelling at him to be dominant...hilarious!).<p>Walken is...well...Walken, and a perfect choice in his role. He says every line in the Walkenesque prose we have learned to love.<p>Scott shows he can play the rough adventure hero. He gets his ASS kicked over and over. This kid has such a future...<p>The soundtrack accentuates, rather than creates, the scene and tempo. The action sequences are a la Brian De Palma (quick clips, snap close-ups) and there's a bit of the Matrix thrown in. The whip-fight scene near the end is phenomenal!<p>This flick was FUN. A great mix of humor and adventure. And I can see a sequel with Scott and the Rock coming. <p>I can't recommend this as a rental. I have to recommend it as an own-it. I have watched mine 3 times already.</p></body></html>

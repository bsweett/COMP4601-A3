<meta name="summary" content="Somewhat intriguing twist on the serial killer theme, but far too many coincidences for it all to work"></head><body><p>Mr. Brooks has a disease: he is addicted to murder.  He tries to treat himself by going to AA meetings and prayer, but eventually he will give in.  His alter-ego, played quite well by William Hurt, is the side of him that he doesn't like to let out.  The chemistry between his two selves works well -- and the filmmakers do a good job allowing his conversations with his other self to integrate seemlessly into the action, so that he can think out loud in the presence of others and not be heard.  To others he simply appears distracted.<br /><br />Probably the best thing about this film is the brilliant casting of William Hurt as Kevin Costner's alter-ego. Costner has been criticized for only playing variations on the same part in all his films: handsome, charming, pleasant but giving off the impression that he's not saying all he thinks, that there is a brooding undercurrent.  In some roles he plays up the charm and in others the brooding undercurrent -- here, it seems, William Hurt gives voice to the brooding and dark and sly hidden persona underneath all of the charm.  He is also charming, but much more sinister -- an ideal counterpart to Costner's screen persona.  One important touch on the part of the filmmakers was to make clear that it was Costner as Brooks who ultimately made all the decisions and committed all of the murders -- his alterego could suggest, encourage, even beg, but he himself was conscious of and took responsibility for all of his crimes.<br /><br />So far this makes for an interesting twist on the serial killer theme that has become a staple of Hollywood film.  It establishes clearly the internal conflict and allows the audience (at least the non sociopaths among us) to achieve the necessary partial identification with the main character -- since he hates what he sometimes allows himself to do, when he yields to the urgings of his alter ego.  The complication arises when he messes up and someone sees him -- but instead of wanting to bribe him, "Mr. Smith" (played convincingly by comedian Dane Cook) wants in: he wants to go along for the next time.  This is another intriguing twist, so at least this far the movie sounded like something different and interesting -- I'm not generally a huge fan of serial killer films but at least this one seemed unique.  There is a bit of a reflexive moment here: "Mr. Smith," like us, was watching the crime through a window just as we are watching on the screen, he was entertained and wanted more, just as, presumably, we are being entertained and will wait eagerly for more action and violence.<br /><br />The real trouble is that the filmmakers try to build a series of subplots into the story that are increasingly implausible.  There is the cop (a badly miscast Demi Moore) who is investigating the "thumbprint murderer" (Mr. Brooks), whose first husband was killed, who is extremely wealthy but feels the need to be a cop, is now involved in a painful divorce with a former male model who apparently married her for her money, is being hunted down by another serial killer who she had put in prison but recently escaped, ... it all starts to seem a bit hokey.  Then add in the story of the daughter, who has recently withdrawn from college, and is apparently pregnant, and is being questioned in relation to a brutal homicide with an ax ... it started to feel like some kind of absurd parody of serial killer film plots, but it was all played so seriously that I think the absurdity was unintended.  At times the film really seemed to switch genres -- as when the cop (Moore) gets into an intense, MTV style shootout with a couple of killers in a hall, with flickering flourescent lights creating a strobe-like effect.<br /><br />This is not without some entertainment value, and has a few things about it that are interesting from the standpoint of thinking about film, but I can't say I found much else to be valuable here.  It wants to be a film suggesting that all of us have a darker side, that at the very least all of us get turned on or entertained a bit by violence or we wouldn't be watching this film.  I don't know, though -- I'm not sure I find that message enlightening or convincing (and how many times have filmmakers tried to "enlighten" their audience about their own complicity in the subject matter of the film -- as if the filmmaker were seeking to exculpate themselves for making a film about violence by saying to the audience: "isn't this what you want to see?  It's not my fault then that I make it for you."). I picked this film up because I like the doppelganger theme, and am generally intrigued by William Hurt's performances and thought the pairing of William Hurt and Kevin Costner would be interesting -- not because I enjoy watching violence (not to say that I am generally put off by it either -- it just has to work in the context of the film).  It is to the filmmaker's credit that they don't push too hard on the "everybody has a dark side" theme -- at least there is no condemnatory monologue or anything like that.  A few intriguing performances, and a few interesting twists, but as a whole I just don't think it all worked together in a satisfying way.<br /><br />Nate Andersen<br />www.eckerd.edu/sundance</p></body></html>

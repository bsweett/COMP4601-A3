<meta name="summary" content="Verhoeven should have directed this"></head><body><p>Yes, Paul Verhoeven should have directed Troy. He could have filmed the graphic violence depicted in The Iliad to greater effect. But I'm sick and tired of all these damn purists hollering "historical" epic. The Iliad was a greek myth, not an actual historical event, but a long poem composed by a writer named Homer. However, I do maintain that if you are going to base the movie on the book, the writer, producer, and director of the film should have kept to the original story. Why call it "Troy" and then fabricate something else if just to sucker in those who've read the Iliad. It's the same thing with comic book adaptations like the X Men. Why adapt material of such a large devoted following and change the character histories, costumes, etc., and call it the X Men?<br /><br />Troy, of itself, is a good Hollywood film. Pawned as Homer's Iliad, the movie's not just a fraud, it's a disgrace and an insult. As if the producers of the film felt that they could improve on a story that's been around, studied, and loved for over 2,500 years. I think Verhoeven, Peter Jackson, or Spielberg--especially with the brutality of Saving Private Ryan (wow)--could have done not only a better job, but they--I believe--would have stayed truer to Homer's original story. As far as violence goes, no novel revels in it like the Iliad. A film version of the book, if depicted as Homer depicted in the Iliad, would be a strong NC-17 or a weak X rating. If you want to see--or visualize--action and violence on a whole other level, read the Iliad and skip Troy. But if you're just looking for a good popcorn, beer, smoke, movie then Troy is as advertised.</p></body></html>

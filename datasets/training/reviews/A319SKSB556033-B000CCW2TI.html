The man who went straight for the raw nerve with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001JV5BIA">The Last House on the Left (Unrated Collectors Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8M0P6">The Hills Have Eyes</a> has seriously gone downhill in the rotten, PC-driven, PG-13 driven Hollywood of today. Studios are afraid to make R-rated movies these days. Not that Red Eye really needs it. But an injection of breathtaking suspense would have really helped this movie along and help us forget the silliness of the plot. As if <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002JT69NM">Cursed [Blu-ray</a>] wasn't bad enough he continues a downward spiral with this very childish quickie with about as much intelligence as a old episode of Baywatch.<br /><br />The plot is thin excuse for the preposterous events in the film to happen and the political sub-plot is so vague and transparent it almost isn't even there. See if you can swallow this. Some hit-man (Cillian Murphy), part of a larger group, wants to convince a hotel manager (Rachel McAdams) to have a VIP move to another suite so he can fire a rocket at him from the ocean that the suite faces. He does this by cornering her on a late night flight (the 'Red Eye') with the threat of one of his henchmen parked outside her unaware dad's (the brilliant Brian Cox) house waiting to kill him if she does not comply. It's very pointlessly contrived. Why do they not just aim at the VIP from a different position and take him out from his original room rather than stalking and planning to scare a hotel manager for 8 weeks?<br /><br />Sixty minutes of this eighty-five minute film are spent on so-called 'mind games' with McAdams and Murphy trying to outwit each other on the plane. It's not thrilling and Craven fails to add any sense of hard edge or unbearable tension to it. McAdams and Murphy give half-hearted performances, totally aware that they are starring in a generic, mundane film. Brian Cox is completely and utterly wasted in a thankless role that requires him to do no more than sit around in a living room speaking single-word lines of dialogue. I can only assume he had a credit card bill to pay off that starring in this bore would settle.<br /><br />The subtext of the oppressed McAdams fighting back against Male tormentors is obvious and actually quite labored. How many more movies must we sit through where females face great (male-driven) opposition and pull through by relying on sheer women-only courage. In the last twenty-minutes McAdams does nothing but beat-down and mutilate Murphy. Fair enough he head-butted her and choked her a bit, but this part is played down and forgotten quickly while Craven makes a point out of Murphy's pain and suffering. I understand that women are easy to feel sorry for in movies (a bit sexist and narrow-minded if you ask me, but hey...I hate PC) but I would like to see a film where a man fights back at a woman who has made HIS life hell. It does happen in real life you know. But men are worthless, violent, evil pigs according to films like this getting real tired of it.<br /><br />Red Eye pretty much fails at everything it sets out to do simply by having a weak script and tepid direction. The teeny-bopper crowd, that this film was undeniably made for, may get a kick out of it but us older and wiser viewers who have been around long enough to appreciate Craven's stronger work will be seriously disappointed. It's worth absolutely none of your attention or hard-earned cash, but at least it's better than Cursed.</p></body></html>

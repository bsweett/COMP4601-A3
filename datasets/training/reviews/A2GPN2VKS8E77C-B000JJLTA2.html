<meta name="summary" content="An Exciting Thrill Ride For Literature Fans."></head><body><p>Academy Award winner & 7-time James Bond Sir Sean Connery stars in a thriller designed for fans of classic literature ("King Solomon's Mines,"<br />"Moby Dick," "20,000 Leagues Under The Sea," "The Strange Case Of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde," "Dracula" and more). Crowd-pleasing dynamite fun for the whole family. Sure, the action is intense, but nothing 10 year-olds can't handle. Also, this movie might inspire the uninitiated to READ these classics of 18th-century literature. Very well-done movie. Only minor negative is that there's no commentary for the deleted scenes, explaining why they were cut from the movie. Other than that, this film is a submarine of fun (pun intended). Rated PG-13, but should have been rated PG.</p></body></html>

The story follows Rocky Balboa as he copes with the loss of his wife, and emerging estrangement with his son.  And of course he is goaded into one more fight...  Somehow they make the premise and the actual fight realistic.  And in the end you're left thinking, "I'm glad they ended it this way, I hope they don't do another"<br /><br />If you want the most fights, see Rocky 3.  The best training sequence?  Rocky 4.  The most disappointing?  Rocky 5.  An appropriate ending to the series?  See this one.</p></body></html>

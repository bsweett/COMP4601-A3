Not only they have parted completely from the light and happy world created by the first two films, but they've also ignored any type of film summary. There's no synopsis of everything that's gone before. And good for that, I say. Go rent the other four if you need to catch up.<br /><br />Year five at Hogwarts begins with our hero Harry angrier than ever. Harry has spent the summer being ignored by everyone after he was discredited by the Daily Prophet for daring to suggest that Lord Voldemort has returned.<br /><br />Once again, Harry and company will have to fight he-who-shall-not-be-named while combating an government that insists and refuses to acknowledge the return of Voldemort. In doing so, the government steps up and introduces a new headmistress at Hogwarts: Dolores Umbridge.<br /><br />You will find that these are indeed "darker" times for all the HP characters. Working with writer Michael Goldenberg, director David Yates have crafted a dark tale to entertain anyone watching. The effects shows us fantastic creatures. But it's the performances where a film is really sold and here they are wonderful.<br /><br />The three leads, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, have all settled easily into their roles. But it's in the supporting cast where these films really shine. Filling out secondary roles with the cream of British theatre and cinema, like Gary Oldman, Imelda Staunton, Helena Bonham Carter, David Thewlis and Ralph Fiennes, everyone else must rise to their level, and they do.<br /><br />The movie shows us the "weird" phase we all go between adult and child, between doing what's right and following the rules and between knowledge and comprehension. When all is said and done, Harry has grown as a character. He is on his way to adulthood with an understanding of the things he's learned in the previous four films.<br /><br />However, there are worrying signs that there are no real developments from film to film: there are no substantial increase in maturity in the films themselves. Every time I sit down to a new Harry Potter movie, I'm surprised by how very similar it is to the previous one.<br /><br />There is a definite feel with The Order of the Phoenix that the story is killing time - setting the scene for the battles yet to come in the last two chapters. This isn't a criticism as such, it's just that having to do that does leave a few unanswered questions. But then, what good would a series be without a few cliffhangers?</p></body></html>

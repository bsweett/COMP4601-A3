There is no plot whatsoever. It's just another bunch of horndogs shacking up at a cabin in the woods and you know who is there. Surprised?. Of course not. The only historical thing about Part 3 is that it was originally in 3-D(not on video, sadly). Plus, it was also the introduction to Jason's hockey mask. The heroine, played horribly by Dana Kimmell, was a history with Jason. Apparently she was attacked by him a while back after she ran into the woods after having a fight with her parents. Whatever. Anyways, the film is violent and bloody as expected. There's even a murder scene that is very reminiscent of Kevin Bacon's demise in the original. The biker gang in this film are the only ones who do good jobs. Everyone else is pretty bad. Still, I like this movie. It's not the best Friday film, but it's up there. Richard Brooker, as Jason, is a good addition to the group of guys who've played him. The follow up, "The Final Chapter", was disappointing. Stupid, trashy fun. I don't know why I like it, I just do.</p></body></html>

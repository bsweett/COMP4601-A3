<meta name="summary" content="Corpse Bride,an original story made for the eyes,heart and mind"></head><body><p>This is yet another fantastic cartoon spawned from the creativity and imagination of Tim Burton.The story is really cute,its great for both kids of all ages and adults.The kids will really like the songs,Danny Elfman again pours his genius into anther fantastic film.Is there nothing these guys can't do?I don't want to give this film away,but it s both visually and auditorily appealing.The ammount of art and skill put into the detail of everything you see on screen is astonishing,you won't believe your eyes.Now for you FX tech junkies out there like myself,these are amongst the most expensive and complicated stop-motion puppets ever created for a stop-motion film to date.The cost of the puppets however aren't as important or impressive however as the engineering that went into them.Just think of all the gears,levers,cables and other mechanisims made for a clock tower but miniaturized into the size of wrist/pocket watch&multiply the number of parts 10 times over.Yeah...that's pretty incredible.This film is as great an accomplishment technology wise as it is in story telling.Truely a gem for all to enjoy for years and years.This is the kind of originality and creativeity that is missing from most all other Hollywood films,and you don't have to be a Tim Burton,or Danny Elfman fan to appreciate it.Rent it to see for yourself,but well worth owning.Don't let this one get away.</p></body></html>

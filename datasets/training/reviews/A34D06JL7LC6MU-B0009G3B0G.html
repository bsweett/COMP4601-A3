Today there's rarely any films like this, instead you have cliched horror films like "The Grudge". Anyway, The Jacket is essentially about Jack Starks (Brody) a Gulf War veteran who feels that he died once after taking a bullet to the head. He survived and while walking through Vermont spots a young girl and her mother standing next to their broke down car. He fixes the car, accepts a ride from a hitchhiker and then he's in court being tried for the murder of a policeman. He's sentenced to be placed in an asylum for the criminally insane and when he arrives there he is subjected to a bizarre treatment in which he is put in a straightjacket and then put inside a morgue drawer. The second time this happens he is suddenly in the year 2007, where he discovers he died in 1993.<br /><br />He knows this because of Jackie (the beautiful Keira Knightley), the adult version of the young girl he met on the side of the road. He finds out that he will die in four days, but he does not find out how. So, then we have Jack trying to find out how he dies before it actually happens and etcetera. The film has great visuals, the director did a great job. Kris Kristofferson is great as Dr. Becker, the doctor subjecting Jack to the bizarre treatments. A+</p></body></html>

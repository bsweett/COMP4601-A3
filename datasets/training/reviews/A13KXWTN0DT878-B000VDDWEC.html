<meta name="summary" content="Dramatic Horror, It Works"></head><body><p>Going into 28 Days Later, I knew little of what to expect. I'd read reviews online explaining how it was mainly a drama with a horror backdrop, but the American trailers and tv spots led to believe that it was a downright horror film with tons of gore to boot. What I got was the first option, a drama with a horror backdrop. And I found it absolutely amazing. <p> A delivery boy wakes up after being in a coma for 28 days to discover the world he knew is now gone, and has been replaced with empty streets littered with dead bodies, and the occasional lunatic trying to kill him. When he's rescued by a pair of what seem at first rip-off commandos from Resident Evil, he is informed that a worldwide virus has wiped off most of humanity, and has made a majority of humanity insane individuals that live off of rage. Now they must rely on each other to survive.<p>  Danny Boyle has made this film a solid metaphor for today's world, and even states that in the movie of how screwed up people could be. Even when they should be helping one another. This brought a deeper meaning to the movie, and actually made me enjoy it more.<p>  One word that popped up in my mind while watching the "climatic showdown" was "subtle." 28 Days Later is very subtle. In it's storyline, action, and pacing. The acting by mostly little known actors was on. Noah Huntley, although at times boring, was pretty good and kept me interested. The star of the movie for me was Naomie Harris. Her transition from heartless survivor to caring protector was faultless, and her hair rocked. The direction Danny Boyle took was on. He knew how to take emotion and suspense to the right level, and keep you there.<p>  Everything in 28 Days Laters combines really well, and for a hardcore movie fan, 28 Days Later pays off. But for those going in expecting the hardcore movie that "reinvents the zombie movie," they're going to be disappointed. As was 2/3 of the people in the theater that I saw it with was.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A very interesting view of the Battle of Iwo Jima from the Japanese view of things"></head><body><p>This is the second movie Clint Eastwood did about the "Battle of Iwo Jima".  The first was "Flags of Our Fathers" that told the story of the TWO flat raisings atop Suribachi, the famous photograph, and the bond drive the funded the latter stages of the war, but at a great cost to the men pulled into that PR engine.  They became casualties of the war as much as those killed or wounded in the battle itself.<br /><br />Here, we see the battle from the perspective of the Japanese who were sent to defend that island and thereby delay the invasion of the Japanese Homeland.  They know the battle will be cataclysmic, but believe there will be reinforcements, naval support, and that they will be supplied with more planes.  When they learn none of this is true, they also realize they are being asked to fight until death.<br /><br />The conditions on the island are not very good.  The water is bad and is giving most of them dysentery.  The new general, Kuribayashi, rescinds the beach defense and wants them to tunnel out the mountain Suribachi.  He wants to prolong the battle as long as possible.  The hard line traditional officers don't like his approach and don't trust him because he has spent time in America and gotten to know American officers.  His one true supporter on the island is Baron Nishi, who won a gold medal in horse jumping at the Los Angeles Olympics in 1932.<br /><br />When the assault does come, the Japanese are stunned by the utter size of the invasion force.  Some fight, some commit suicide (against orders) so they can die with "honor", but almost all die.  In real life, of the 21,000 Japanese soldiers on the island, all but 216 died.  Among the American invasion force of 110,000, 8,226 died and 19,189 were wounded and almost 500 went missing.<br /><br />The movie uses a fictional character named Saigo, a baker conscripted into the war, to link the various elements of the battle together by his movements.  A very nice device.  It is this character who buries the letters of the title that are uncovered by modern day archaeologists digging in the caves and tunnels of Suribachi.<br /><br />Some have criticized the movie for making the "Americanized" Japanese officers the stars.  I have no opinion about that argument, but I really enjoyed the movie.  The fact that it is almost entirely in Japanese with subtitles didn't bother me in the least.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

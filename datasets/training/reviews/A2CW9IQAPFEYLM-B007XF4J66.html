<meta name="summary" content="The Best"></head><body><p>Casablanca is simply the most enjoyable movie I've ever seen, bar none. The setting is Rick's Cafe in Casablanca at the beginning of WW II. Everyone here wants out of Casablanca, except Rick (Bogart), who has escaped here from Paris and the woman he's loved and who's jilted him. He is cynical, interested only in himself. Then one day Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), his lost love, shows up, in the company of husband vc xVicor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), a great Resistance leader. They, too, want to escape to America, but the Nazis plan on stopping him. Through an accident Rick has the only means of getting them out: letters of transit that cannot be rescinded. It's Rick's conscience versus an old love wound; there is some doubt which will win (even when making the movie this doubt remained right up to the final days of shooting), and at what cost.<br /><br />Everything works perfectly in this movie--the cynicism, the idealism, the twists and turns toward the conclusion. Bogart is at his tough-guy-on-the-outside-softy-on-the-inside best; Bergman is lovely; Claude Rains as the police commissioner is witty and almost as cynical as Rick; Sidney Greenstreet is great in a minor role. This movie never fails, no matter how many times viewed. Wonderful!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I get bashed for not liking a movie that was almost so much more"></head><body><p>Seeing this movie, and expecting something innovative, I was disappointed with what I got.  And while it wasn't terrible, it wasn't something I saw as worth multiple re-releases and being hailed as a classic.<br /><br />And for these comments, I get bashed and flamed and mocked and insulted for things beyond my control.  As of now and the viewing of this film, I was/am only 20 years old, but apparently I'm not old enough to "get" this film, because according to the people who commented on my review, I'm "still a child" and given a mantra of "You just don't get it".<br /><br />And this time it was completely different from the "You just don't get it typical American needing your car chases and gunfights to be entertained" mantra given for pretentious crappy art films, it was a "You just don't get it because you're a snobbish little twit for being 20 years old".  Wow!<br /><br />And kind of ironically, I end up re-releasing my review, changed a bit by circumstances unrelated to these flamers.<br /><br />Spending some time thinking about the film and watching "Rambo" again and "First Blood II", I saw that the film was not a 2/5 but more a 3/5 in my view.  I do that because the character of John Rambo himself is a far more well-rounded character than I gave credit for, and he is a far more amiable and pitiable person than I had originally thought.<br /><br />The plot in my opinion does not spend enough time on the true "story" of the film.  The subtle, ulterior plot that I had not even noticed until some time after the movie, ultimately culminated in "Rambo" in 2008; that John Rambo died in Vietnam, and what emerged from the jungle was a broken, lonely man, unable to overcome the fact that, as he so put it in "Rambo", war is in his blood.<br /><br />The movie does spend plenty of time on this, culminating in a climactic monologue by Rambo which is itself worth a viewing of the film, but the more pressing factors of "Generic Action Flick One-Man-Army-Bad-Ass-Mutha vs Faceless Baddies" overwhelmed me upon a first viewing.<br /><br />In "First Blood", there wasn't enough affirmation that this story is about John Rambo, either in the form of more flashbacks, or more exposition, and instead muddle it under a frenzy of cold, detached action that may fare well to draw in a larger, entertainment-oriented crowd, but ultimately costs the main theme of the film sufficient build-up for the big final climax which solidifies the movie.<br /><br />So in short, the movie could have been a classic.  But too much energy was built towards short-term action rather than long-term drama.  Quite frankly, I'm pointing more towards Rambo flashbacks by the campfire, and less Doofballed Douchebags blowing up a cave entrance then getting rowdy as fratboys for nearly effing up the mission ("Bullseye!" says one particularly stupid-looking idiot with glasses after firing a bazooka into the cave entrance, in a closeup shot and one-liner that really could have been done away with without any harm whatsoever).</p></body></html>

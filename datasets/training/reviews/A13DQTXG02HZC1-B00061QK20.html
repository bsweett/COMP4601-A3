These two movies are so far apart from one another, akin to chalk and cheese.  Where "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" is a no-nonsense straight-up story telling, "Hero" is more like a "Pulp Fiction" type of story telling.  The same story is told from different perspectives and then, we shall decide for ourselves what actually happened and what outcome would we expect from those happenings.  Many of my Chinese peers were utterly disappointed with "Hero" because it's arguably one of the most expensive Chinese movie ever made & yet, the final touch didn't quite live up to their expectation.  Naturally, it's a star-studded movie with appearances by Jet Li, Maggie Cheung, Tony Leung, Zhang Jiyi.  Due to Director's involvement in theatre productions in China, I would like to believe that he applied the visual touches of theatres into this cinema spectacle that I could only describe as spectacular.  This time around, the martial arts is emphasised with special effects, & in order to prevent viewers from been confused with narrations by Jet Li, the cast were given the blue, red, & white treatments.  For example, from one person's point of view, it's rendered the "blue", but from another person's, it's actually "red", & the truth is to be revealed in "white".  It's quite imaginative to concoct a story about these few assasins who had attempted various times to rid of Emperor Chin, the Emperor who united China from various Kingdoms, the Emperor who gave us the Great Wall of China, & also the Emperor who in his later years would sent his followers around the world looking for elixir of life to give him the gift of immortality, and as the legend goes, those followers of his ended up settling in Japan & thus, the Japanese today.  In the end, the assassins were the ones who convinced him that he's on the right path and thus, the formation of modern China.  Talking about mixing fact with fiction.  Overall, this is definitely a beautiful movie, a movie that deserves to be enjoyed but one also has to accept that it's an ambitious movie that didn't quite pick up an Oscar this year.  Still, it's still a good movie to be had.  Well done.</p></body></html>

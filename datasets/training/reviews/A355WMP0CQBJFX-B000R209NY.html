<meta name="summary" content="AN ADVENTUROUS VOYAGE!!"></head><body><p>i really liked this movie, it was pretty good. the whole ship going upside down, having to find a way out before the ship sinks, and only a handful survive. i enjoyed it from beginning to end. the jumping, the climbing, and the swimming they did throughout the whole ship to get to their destination was nicely done. i do recommend because it has that good combination of action and suspense to draw you in. josh lucas was is a very good actor and here he just proved it again. something charming about this guy, and they way he just falls into the leadership role, and becomes the hero. kurt russell, the doting father, has to get through it with his daughter. he hasn't lost his touch. the small appearance of fergie was widely viewed as well. it wasn't another big ship sinks movie, but a story of survival, in one of the worst case scenarios. i do recommend.</p></body></html>

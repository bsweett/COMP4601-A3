<meta name="summary" content="I understand why people love this movie"></head><body><p>Wedding Crashers is a return to the rated R nudity and sex filled buddy comedy that was made popular in the 80's...and then died out.  Here we have a movie with two of the most solid new comic movie personas with in the last ten years and they're teamed together.  These two fit together on paper let alone on the first day of production so the film is filled with charm and humor, but for anyone who thinks this film is just for the guys to go to, or trick their girlfriends/wives to seeing, there's a strong them within the film about love and it's so strong that I wouldn't even call it a subplot.  What's interesting is that there are elements of the mainstream chick flick in this film, making it highly accessible.  The problem I have with this film is that is just doesn't seem like a natural fit, but all the necessary parts are there.  They just don't quite fit to me. As much as I like the fact that the film presents a really strong female character and is also a semi-sex comedy is good news, but the film doesn't mesh these two elements together in a good way.  Don't get me wrong, the film would be totally able to get away with its lack of attention to finetuning if it didn't stop for the love story angle, the poignancy allows you to see just how shoddy it is.  While I know that the films are as different as fruits, "There's Something About Mary" was the last raunchy comedy to succesfully pull off the love angle and still feel well done and while other Farelly Brothers films of similar plotline haven't had the courage to go as far and limit their hijinks to pg-13 levels of vulgarity and profanity.  I think a film can be funny without that stuff, but that's not the kind of movie I'm reviewing.  I'm reviewing a balls to the wall, 'uncorked' movie full of profanity, sex, and nudity.  A film that lets it all hang without concern for rating knowing that it's geared to an older audience.  I understand all the people that applaud this film for going there and being funny while also attempting to be poignant, however, it wasn't a good idea for them to release their film around the same time only to compared to "The 40 Year Old Virgin" which has it beat on poignant points and might be funnier in a more realistic way than "Wedding Crashers."  "Wedding Crashers" made more money and so my opinion doesn't really matter, and I'm in the minority, but the film isn't completely bad, it just isn't well done in my opinion and there are things in the film that are memorable, like Will Ferrell's character at the end and Vince Vaughn's turn into love, but overall, it's a movie of excesses that it can't legitimize dramatically (and by dramatically, I mean they could have been more fun).</p></body></html>

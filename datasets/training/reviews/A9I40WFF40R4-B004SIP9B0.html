<meta name="summary" content="Mirren Is The Queen"></head><body><p>Stephen Fears follows one "A" movie "Mrs. Henderson Presents" with yet another of the same quality, "The Queen." Most of the film has to do with the week or so after the untimely death of Princess Diana and the royal family's reaction to it and their totally misjudging the public's reaction. Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, because of their icy stoicism and, more importantly, their total distaste for the princess, were all set to stay at Balmoral, ignore the press, make no public statement, have a small private funeral and let Prince Philip take Princess Diana's sons hunting to divert them from their sorrow. The royal couple, as the whole world now knows, got their comeuppance, and at the eleventh hour, managed to do the right thing but not without the help of a very determined Tony Blair.<br /><br />The acting is excellent with only the Queen Mother being miscast. Dame Helen Mirren convinces you she is the queen; both Prince Philip and Prince Charles are believable; and Michael Sheen gives an outstanding performance as Prime Minister Tony Blair ("Just call me 'Tony'"). The movie belongs just as much to the prime minister as to the queen. There is a scene near the end of the film when Blair has an audience with Queen Elizabeth and she reminds him of the fickleness of the public. We are reminded, rather sadly, that he bought into a war that ultimately cost him his position.<br /><br />Although Fears of course covers the death and funeral of Princess Diana ("the people's Princess"), he does it with grace and respect and never  exploits the sad events. For example, her sons never speak nor are seen closeup. Additionally the actual footage of events at the time is so well integrated with the rest of the movie so that the two are indistinguishable, no small feat on the part of both the director and cinemaphotographer.<br /><br />The critics are already talking about an Oscar nomination for Mirren. She richly deserves one.</p></body></html>

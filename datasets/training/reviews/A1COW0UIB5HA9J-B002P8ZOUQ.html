<meta name="summary" content="Fun prequel!"></head><body><p>IN 1846, a pair of young mutant boys named James and Victor murdered their abusive father with their abilities and run away to go off to many wars over the years as they don't age like regular people and are sort of immortal. From the Civil War to Vietnam in the 70's, James a.k.a. Logan (Huge Jackman) and his big brother nicknamed Sabretooth (Liv Schriber) have joined a secret government agency task force. But after killing innocent people in Nigeria, six years later he decides to make a better life in the Canadian rockies with a beautiful girlfriend Kayla(Lynn Collins) and with a job. However after Kayla was murdered, Logan particaptes in a experiment involving a rare indestructable metal called adamantium as it makes his skeleton and claws even more powerful then ever. He still retains his powers of immortality and self-healing as now he vows revenge on his brother and those that killed his true love, but it seems Stryker is kidnapping mutants and using them for experiments. He teams up with a Cajun mutant with unique explosive powers named Gambit a.k.a. Remy Labeau (Taylor Kitsch) and John Wraith (Will I.Am) who's powers include teleporting as they must find the mutants to free them.<br /><br />Entertaining and action-packed prequel to the X-Men saga is a fascinating film. This one sets itself 15 years before the first movie as it tells us how Wolverine became to be the savage hero he is today and a little history that it adapts the graphic novel "Wolverine: ORIGINS" quite well on the screen. The mutants from the comics are here such as Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), Chris Bradley (Dominic Morgan), The Blob (Kevin Durad), Agent Zero (Daniel Henney), a young Scott Summers a.k.a. Cyclops (Tim Pocock) and an appearence by Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier. This is very entertaining but not a masterpiece like the first X-Men movies and the third movie wasn't bad as the fans proclaimed it was, this one manages to improve over that one and gave us a look of how Logan became to be long before he was a member of the X-Men.<br /><br />This 3-Disc Blu-Ray has flawless picture and sound that blows the viewer out of their seats and the extras are terrific such as featurettes, audio commentaries, Files on the characters, Fox Movie Channel World Premiere featurette, a look at the Helicopter chase, a unique X-Mode Bonus view, a bonus standard def DVD and a digital copy.</p></body></html>

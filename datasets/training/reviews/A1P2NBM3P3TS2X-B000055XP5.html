Goodness knows, there have been missteps in the past.  But director Brian Singer does about as good a job as can be reasonably expected. First off, we need to thank the makers of Mission Impossible 2 for running over-schedule, thus tying up actor Dougray Scott and consequently allowing actor Hugh Jackman to play Wolverine.  Jackman is the standout in this movie.  His wonderfully understated performance as the &quot;reluctant hero&quot; is arguably the centerpiece of this film.<p>What distinguishes this film from other lesser film adaptions is an intelligent script, or at least intelligent for the genre.  Character development isn't sacrificed to make room for more standard mindless special effects and action setpieces, like in some movies (&quot;Batman and Robin&quot;, anyone?).  <p>The in-jokes are funny, and the characters' history and motivations are treated with a fan's level of respect.<p>If the filmmakers can retain those elements of character-driven story and a respect for the source material in future installments, then they may have a successful movie franchise on their hands</p></body></html>

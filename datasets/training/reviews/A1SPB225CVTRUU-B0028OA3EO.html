The film is a bit slow-paced for the first hour, but once things start to explode, it's non-stop action and spectacular visuals. The characters are not well written and developed. I don't really care for Kate Bosworth's rendition of Lois Lane. I thought that good girl/bad girl Parker Posey deserved more material to work with. Kevin Spacey is effortlessly stole many scenes, but his character is not evil enough to hate him. As for new comer Brandon Routh, I think he's very handsome, got a great body, and his performance is good enough. Isn't he a bit too young looking to have a kid(ops, spoiler)? The film lacked a heavy duty showdown battle between Superman and Lex. Perhaps they are saving it for the sequel.</p></body></html>

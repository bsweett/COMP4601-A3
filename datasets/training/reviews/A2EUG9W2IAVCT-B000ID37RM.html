<meta name="summary" content="Amazing"></head><body><p>Harper Lee's Pulitzer prize-winning ageless novel To Kill a Mockingbird is one of the finest pieces of literature, past or present, ever composed.  The movie of the same name, inspired and based solely on the book, is brilliant as well; this updated Special Edition DVD is presented in beautiful packaging and includes many bonus features, including an extra disc featuring a "Conversation with Gregory Peck," the amazing actor behind Atticus Finch, the hero of the book and film.  The movie itself is truly amazing in every sense, and even the usage of black and white in mostly color pictures and TV make it even more superb.  Perfect book, perfect film adaption; one of the best films of all time.</p></body></html>

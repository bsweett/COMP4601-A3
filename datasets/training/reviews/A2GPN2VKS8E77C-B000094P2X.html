Thrilling Appetizer."></head><body><p>Chronologically the second entry in the Hannibal Lecter saga, "Red Dragon" delivers everything, with an all-star cast, a fine screenplay, and haunting music from Danny Elfman. Sir Anthony returns for his curtain call to the role that launched him into Hollywood immortality. With some fancy computer work, Sir Anthony both looks and acts younger as the chilling Dr. Lecter, oozing menace and charm all in one. Edward Norton is appropriately tortured and duty-bound as Will Graham, the ex-FBI agent who caught Lecter (this is done in a chilling pre-credits sequence). Ralph Fiennes is evil and tormented as The Tooth Fairy, and Emily Watson is simply sublime as the woman who tames the beast. I felt that Mary Louise-Parker and the actor who played her son were under-used, but it doesn't detract from a great story. thrilling appetizer to "Silence Of The Lambs," which is the prelude to the even more delicious "Hannibal." the film should have been rated PG-13.</p></body></html>

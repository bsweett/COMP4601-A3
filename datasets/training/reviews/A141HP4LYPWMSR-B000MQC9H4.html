<meta name="summary" content=""I'm Looking For Corny In My Life" ~ Trans-Continental Escapism And Inevitable Romance"></head><body><p>What happens when two love scorned women, one in Los Angeles and the other in England, switch houses in an attempt to spend some time alone and away from men? Why they fall in love with the first man they meet upon arrival. What else would you expect? Yes, the plot is predictable and the premise overdone. And yes, this is most definitely a chick flick. But take heart you testosterone laden Neanderthals in the audience, Jack Black is one of the male love interests so you're safe to watch.<br /><br />`The Holiday' released in `06 is a light, good-hearted, romantic comedy boasting four popular stars involved in two separate romances on two continents, Cameron Diaz and Jude Law in England and Kate Winslet and Jack Black in Los Angeles. Both storylines are engaging and the chemistry is believable. My only complaint about the film is that more time was spent developing the romance in England and less on the Winslet/Black relationship in L.A. which happened to be my favorite part of the movie. Oh well, still a lot of fun and a great date film. The Los Angeles romance also includes a wonderful subplot with Eli Wallach which is a great addition to the storyline.</p></body></html>

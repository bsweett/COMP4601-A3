It's a big improvement but far from perfect or even what a Resident Evil movie should be. It's light on the horror and suspense and heavy on the cheese. Everything from the costumes to the dialog is just so cheesy that it ruins any kind of terror you might experience in one of the games. I think Silent Hill got it right in it's film adaptation. It was more on the dark and creepy side while this is more bright and almost a comedy.</p></body></html>

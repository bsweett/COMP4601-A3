Based on the controversial book, Starship Troopers tells the story of a young man named Johnny Rico who joins the military so he can become a "citizen".  In fact, all of the new recruits are all real young men and women, but what they don't know is the horrors that await them.  Director Paul Verhoeven's patented penchant for graphic violence (see his other films Robocop and Total Recall if you wanna see what I mean) is in full effect here, human soldiers are dismembered in full gorey glory here, and the special effects are some of the best I've ever seen in a movie (and this was made in 1997).  But behind the excellent special effects and gut churning gore, there is an underlying theme leftover from the novel, the horrors of war and the loss of innocence when youngsters must endure it.  The ensemble cast includes Casper Van Dien, Denise Richards, Dina Meyer, Jake Busey, Michael Ironside, Clancy Brown, Neal Patrick Harris, and Patrick Muldoon.  Highly recommended to any fan of sci-fi or action in general.</p></body></html>

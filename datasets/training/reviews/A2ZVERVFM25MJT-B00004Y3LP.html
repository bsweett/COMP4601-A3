Based on the Michael Crichton novel it retains the barest threads of the scientific argument.  Indeed, this argument is mostly represented by Jeff Goldblum who is rapidly demoted to a back seat.  That's not too important though seen as this is the kind of movie that manages to genuinely fascinate its audience with its outstanding special effects.  Even several years on, the sight of the T-Rex clawing its way past metal fencing remains spectacular.<p>Basically this is a rollercoaster ride and little else but for what it is, 'Jurassic Park' is great fun.  Placing its little humans in various apparently inescapable situations seems to be the story, but what situations they are!  There's a car falling through a tree inch by inch, a huge T-Rex and a particularly nasty little one that seems cute and innocent at first.  Most impressively though, it remains pretty scary.  Rather than overusing the big T-Rex, the raptors are much scarier and more efficient at making the audience jump.  One particularly well constructed scene has two kids hiding out in a kitchen which is being stalked by two vicious raptors.<p>The acting, as in many movies like this, is incidental.  Neill plays a pretty flat main character, Dern excels as a feisty archaeologist, the kids are good value, Goldblum is fun whilst Attenborough doesn't appear to do anything.  Most importantly though 'Jurassic Park' grips from the very beginning and will keep you on the edge of your seat.  It's not the most complicated movie ever,..., but it's definitely thrill-packed.</p></body></html>

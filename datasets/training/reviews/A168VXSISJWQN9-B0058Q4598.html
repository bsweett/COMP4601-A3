<meta name="summary" content="Bit of a bad rap"></head><body><p>While I understand why people find this movie inferior to the 1951 original, I think it has been given a bit of a bad rap. Sure, the plot is as full of holes as a swiss cheese, but when I watch a sci-fi action movie I'm not really looking for deep analysis of the human condition. This movie gets right on with the action and doesn't stop till the end of the film. It's not a good script, but things happen and keep on happening. Don't watch it to elevate your mind or gain new insights; watch it to see some amazing special effects, good camera work and non-stop action. On those terms, it's a three-star movie.</p></body></html>

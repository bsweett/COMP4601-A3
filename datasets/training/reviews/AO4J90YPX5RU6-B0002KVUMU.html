I, on the other hand feel that it fails in the same way that 2003's "HULK" failed. First of all there are to many classic monsters in one movie. The actor that played Dracula should be shot. He was horrid. It was almost a comedic performance. He is probably the worse thing about the movie. Dracula is one of my favorite characters in film history, but it takes the right actor to play him. I'll take Gary Oldman anyday. Well enough about that. The story is ludicrous. Somehow Hollwood can bring Freddy and Jason together more believably than Dracula and Frankenstien, go figure.. In my one man's opinion, I feel that if you're gonna make a BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER movie, you should just call it that. I was inspired to watch 1992's "BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA" again (which features the character Van Helsing, played by Anthony Hopkins). I recommend you skip "VAN HELSING" and go with "BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA" instead. It's a classic. This film isn't. By the way there is a BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER movie, it's a comedy that stars Kristy Swanson as a cheerleader turned vampire slayer.</p></body></html>

Remember, I thought of that first!"></head><body><p>Stephen Chow wrote, directed, and starred in this entertaining adventure, a cinematic ensemble of interesting and unique characters.  I haven't seen a martial arts film this good in a long time.  In my opinion, this was like the movie Grease without the singing and dancing, although there was some dancing.  I picture wedding parties doing the axe-gang dance all over the world.  In fact, I think an axe-gang dance video would be a big seller!  Workout tapes could follow.<br /><br />  From the opening scenes of the movie, where a gang leader takes out his anger and frustration on the local police department, to the rolling of the credits, Stephen Chow and his cast of dedicated actors have put together one of the best comedies ever.<br /><br />  But Kung Fu Hustle is not just a comedy.  It's a story with a message, a message about doing what's right, even if that means you are going to take a few lumps, serious lumps!  And what makes the movie so much fun is that director Stephen Chow knows when to jump back and forth between the serious and the not-so-serious scenes in this movie.<br /><br />  Chow's character, Sing, is best described as a gangster wanna-be who has a long series of failures in this film.  But we never stop wondering exactly what he will screw up next, and when he becomes entangled in a bit of gang warfare, his ridiculous antics rise in their comedic value.  There is a scene where Sing demonstrates his knife throwing ability that had me literally crying I was laughing so hard.  Stephen Chow is a natural on the movie screen.<br /><br />  Some of the clashes between the people of the besieged slum and their attackers are so visually stimulating that I shall never forget them.  When the two harpists come to kill the defenders of the slum, we are witnesses to some amazing cinematic treasures, as the special effects are top-notch.  Famed action choreographer Yuen Wo Ping goes beyond the call of duty in Kung Fu Hustle, working both the realistic approach to fight scene creation and the "hey, nobody-could-ever-do-that" sequences.  That unique tactic made the film stand apart from almost anything I have ever seen before.<br /><br />  I think Stephen Chow is a genius, and I am going to go rent Shaolin Soccer as soon as possible!  I highly recommend Kung Fu Hustle.  It is a great movie!<br /><br />See ya next review!</p></body></html>

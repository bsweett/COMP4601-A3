<meta name="summary" content="Horror at it's finest (and goriest)"></head><body><p>I just want to say that in the past week I've watched two of the most brutal horror movies I've ever seen and both of them were directed by Alexandre Aja who is most likely the most ingenious horror director working right now (much better than Wes Craven that's for sure).  In this film Aja develops a truly horrifying sequence of events and builds an intense and disturbing atmosphere that will eat at you until the very end.  `High Tension' takes place in France and it follows the formula set out by Dean Koontz in `Intensity' where you have a young girl named Marie (Cecile De France) who's visiting her friend Alex's (Maiwenn Le Besco) family when a stranger breaks in and kills everyone off leaving Marie to save herself.  Yes, as many have stated, the ending is a shocker and some may feel slighted slightly but I don't feel it a total letdown.  Cecile and Maiwenn do a great job of portraying completely convincing fear and pain.  All in all this is a horrifying ride full of realistic gore and quality scares.  Highly recommended for any fan of the horror genre, this ones a keeper.</p></body></html>

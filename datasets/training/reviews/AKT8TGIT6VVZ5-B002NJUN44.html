However, I suspect diehard fans of fantasy film and literature will be quite disappointed. Sadly "Eragon" comes across as a mediocre imitation of "Star Wars", with the hero, Eragon himself, as a pale fourth-rate version of Luke Skywalker (There is a scene in the film which all too readily echoes the classic image of Luke staring out from his uncle's Tatooine farm at sunset, pondering his fate.), combined with a barely credible version of sword and sorcery harkening back to Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings". While other Amazon.com customer reviewers have severely criticized the film director and screenwriters for producing a poor film adaptation of the novel, I can't help but wonder whether the fault lies too with the author, Christopher Paolini, for producing what is at best, a second-rate version of fantasy literature, borrowing too extensively from classics like "The Lord of the Rings" and the "Chronicles of Narnia". There are truly a handful of good reasons to see this film, starting with Jeremy Irons' fine portrayal of Brom, the Obi-Wan Kenobi-like figure, who becomes a mentor to young Eragon. Another fine reason is Robert Carlyle's portrayal of Durza, the wicked wizard, who comes across as a more malevolent mixture of Brad Dourif's Wormtongue and Christopher Lee's Saruman from Peter Jackson's "The Lord of the Rings" cinematic trilogy (John Malkovich's evil King Galbatorix steals every scene he appears in, but alas, it's only for a few brief moments at best.). Last, but not least, I think Peter Doyle has composed a memorable film score which ranks with his earlier, classic scores for Kenneth Branagh's splendid cinematic adaptations of Shakespeare. Otherwise, unless you are a diehard fan of the fantasy novel "Eragon", I recommend skipping this film and renting instead Peter Jackson's "The Lord of the Rings" from your local DVD rental store.</p></body></html>

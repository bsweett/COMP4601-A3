I didn't want to see it, but when there is nothing else to do I decide to watch something I can later turn around and review, so this was sitting at my house (my sister brought it over) and so I decided to sit down and give it a watch through.  I actually enjoyed it.  It wasn't nearly as corny as I expected, and aside from Jessica Alba (yes she's utterly gorgeous but my god is she a terrible actress) the acting was decent for a superhero flick.  Julian McMahon is one of my favorite TV actors (I just love Christian on `Nip/Tuck') and here, as Victor Von Doom, he's the perfect bad guy.  Michael Chiklis does a great job as thing and Chris Evans fits in nice as the hot shot Johnny Storm.  This isn't your `Spider-Man' or `Batman Begins' so don't expect something deep or meaningful or something altogether `fantastic' but if you aren't expecting anything you might just find that this offers something worth watching.  It's fun, breezy and at times cleverly exciting.</p></body></html>

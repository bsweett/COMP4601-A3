<meta name="summary" content="On its own a good scifi-thriller, but  weakest Alien sequel"></head><body><p>Alien 3 has the unfortunate task of trying to live up to Ridley Scott's excellent Alien and James Cameron's equally thrilly Aleins. First-time director David Fincher was handed the reins by the Alien franchise's producers and tries to live up to the Alien franchise's pedigree.<br /><br />Fincher's direction of this third leg of the Alien Quadrilogy can't be faulted for this film's weakness when compared to the first two Alien films. Fincher's career after Alien 3 can attest to the fact that this man has very great directing skills i.e. The Game, Se7en, Fight Club and Panic Room. I place the blame for this leg of the Quadrilogy wholly on the team of writers who decided to go away from the conclusion of Aliens go their own disastrous way. I would applud such a daring move if it made sense, but discarding of certain characters that became such a huge part of the franchise was just idiotic. These writers could have easily taken a look at the excellent Dark Horse Comic series that continued the Alien story after Cameron's film and set it on Earth. Now that would've been a film that I'd rather see have been made under Fincher's direction.<br /><br />The acting in Alien 3 is actually very good. Once again, Sigourney Weaver as Ripley becomes the bedrock upon which the rest of the cast rallies around. Charles Dance's inmate-doctor Clemens does a great job of creating an early repoirte with Ripley. But the stand-out of the film has to be Charles S. Dutton's character of Dillon: the spiritual leader of the prison colony of Fury. Dutton's portrayal of Dillon was very powerful and one could actually see the righteous anger seething just beneath the surface.<br /><br />The film's tone borrows more from Scott's Alien than Cameron's sequel. Right from the start the tension begins and once the Alien is born and starts hunting the prisoners and prison staff members, the film begins to start moving. The CG work on the Alien-dog hybrid looks dated when seen in this dvd edition, even after some digital remastering. But the close-ups puppetry and animatronics is as good if not better than what was in Aliens.<br /><br />The ending of the film does take abit too long to unfold when seen in the theaters, but when seen in the comforts of one's own home its easier to tolerate. Alien 3 is the most spiritual of the 4 films in the Quadrilogy, a very good scifi thriller and overall the film would've stood well if just judge on its own merits. But one cannot judge an Alien film without at least some comparison to the rest of the Quadrilogy's films. On that note, Alien 3 has to be the weakest of the bunch. I'd recommend this film for scifi and Alien aficionados, but for casual film fans I say rent it first and see what you think.</p></body></html>

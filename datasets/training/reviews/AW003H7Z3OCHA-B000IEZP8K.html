<meta name="summary" content="Great Action and Adventure Tale on Widescreen DVD!!!!!"></head><body><p>Thats right! This movie is a great action tale in the spirit of the distant departed Indiana Jones Eygptian epics. This mummy sequel is better than the Original Mummy (which established the characters &amp; theme). All of the ensemble cast returns. The established characters roles are expanded, action packed, great dual love story (immortal vs mortal), unbelievable special effects. Like Indiana Jones movies you buy into the story and question nothing about the physical or mental capabilities of the characters or plot.<br />In summary: Our hero's are a family unit. We find out the destinies of 2 plots. Good (True Love) vs Evil (Symbolic Love) and all that goes with it. Indiana Jones was basically a single (loner) macho scientific action hero who defied and conquered all a trilogy we all loved. The Mummy Series provides a team of individuals with unique talents when established and thrown together form an unbeatable team.<br />Indiana Jones remained single where as Rick O'Connell marries Evie and have a Son. This trio actively and cooperatively solve riddles, battle and succeed together.<br />This DVD is Widescreen and Digitally Enhanced to provide the best picture, period. If you are a PROGRESSIVE SCAN, COMPONENT VIDEO, HDTV/16:9 WIDESCREEN OWNER, with a DIGITAL THEATRE SYSTEM OWNER stand by for one of the greatest cinematic rides ever.<br />Like Indiana Jones, Rick &amp; Evie capture our hearts and lead us on a great 1930's Eygptian Adventure.<br />P.S. - Wait to you find out the O'Connells real destinies. That is the real story which unfolds!!!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Troy" entertains, but there's something missing"></head><body><p>"Troy" is in many ways an infuriating film, because it seemed like a sure thing.  Everyone knew that a major film had to be made about the battle for Troy, arguably the most famous one in the history of western civilization (at least in terms of its fame longevity).  A talented cast and proven director was assembled, it was given a $160,000,000 budget, and the prerelease hype was huge.  Of course, the film was roasted when it was finally released, and its final gross (at least domestically) was very disappointing.  Now that the hype has died down, I can say that "Troy" is not a bad movie, but just a disappointing one.<br /><br />The movie is awash in moral ambiguity.  That might work for Vietnam War films, but it is missplaced here.  We desparately want a hero to root for, but Achilles does not fit that mold.  For most of the film, he's cold, unsympathetic, and even borderline cruel.  Brad Pitt's performance does not help- it is adequate at its best moments, and terrible at its worst.  Where's Tyler Durden when you need him?<br /><br />As it turns out, the best and most sympathetic performances are given from the Trojan side, in the forms of Eric Bana and Peter O'Toole.  Bana's Hector seems to be the hero that the audience can root for, and Bana himself is terrific in the role.  This makes the film a real downer, however.  Hector's inevitable fate makes him disappear three quarters of the way through, and without him the film's ending is weak, as we've run out of people to root for.  O'Toole is also touching as the Trojan king, but he is not given enough screen time.<br /><br />Ultimately, the audience sympathizes with Troy, which makes its inevitable end that much more disappointing.  The Greeks are led by an arrogant and greedy king, played by Brian Cox with over-the-top menace (I know this guy is good at being a villain, but he should seriously consider being in a romantic comedy or something.  STRETCH a little, man!).  By the end of "Troy", we are rooting against the Greeks, and their inevitable victory renders the ending flat.  Imagine if Sauron had triumphed at the end of "Return of the King", and you'll have an idea how much of a downer "Troy" ends up being.  I suppose we're supposed to root for Achilles at the end because he has a sudden change of heart, but it's too little too late, and Pitt does not make the change in Achilles convincing.<br /><br />If you haven't realized by now, I liked "Troy" all the way up to its ending (although its running time should have been 20 minutes shorter).  The disappearance of Bana and O'Toole from the movie's final moments render them flat, and the failure of the movie to deliver a rousing climax is ultimately its undoing.  Many of the battle scenes in here are spectacular and some of the performances (at least on the Trojan side) are effective, but in the end I'm afraid that "Troy" is better for a rental than a purchase.</p></body></html>

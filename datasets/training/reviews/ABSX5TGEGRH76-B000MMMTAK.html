Sacha Baron Cohen's character of Borat, a Kazakh TV reporter, is not real, and yet he was able to fool a whole lot of people into thinking he was.  The film follows Borat (Cohen) and his producer Azamat (Ken Davitian) as they travel across the United States to film a documentary with the mission of observing American culture and using it to improve Kazakhstan.  The twist is that while Borat and Azamat are fictional characters, most everyone in the film are real people.<br /><br />The film starts and ends in Borat's home village in Kazakhstan, which is portrayed as a stereotypical ex-communist bloc country; it is very poor, cultural aspects that were cool in America 20 years ago are cool now, and there is a lot of intolerance (the town is extremely anti-Semitic).  All of the people in these scenes are actors, but once Borat gets to America, nearly (I would say 98%) all of the people interviewed for the documentary are real people who have no idea that Borat isn't real.<br /><br />While the stated purpose of Borat is to make Kazakhstan a better country, Cohen's mission statement was to show the sheer absurdity of American political correctness.  Though we live in a PC culture, racist, sexist, and other "-ist" ideas boil beneath the surface.  Borat is a character who says incredibly offensive things without realizing it.  His poor grasp on the English language and racist and sexist upbringing get him into trouble with a lot of people, such as when he tells a group of feminists that it is a proven fact that women have smaller brains than men.  The interesting thing is that most people don't object to any of the insensitive things that Borat says, while a few even agree with him and back up his claims.  For example, while attending a rodeo in the south, he tells the foreman that in his country, homosexuals are hanged.  The foreman responds by saying that people in America wish that they could do that here.<br /><br />The movie is incredibly offensive, but nothing that Borat says will offend you.  It is what we Americans do in response.  Borat is a fictional character, and while the things he says are silly, we know that Cohen doesn't mean them.  It is the responses of our fellow citizens that are shockingly offensive and hilarious.  Whether it be the Texan antique shop owner whose store is full of Confederate battle flags and pro-secession messages or the gun shop employee who answers Borats question of, "What gun would you reccomend to kill Jew?" with, "Probably a 9mm", it is a real eye-opener to see how some people in this country really think.<br /><br />It's amazing to think that the people who participated in this "documentary" didn't read their release forms closely enough to realize what was really going on when they signed them (though the frat boys from the end of the film are trying to sue due to feelings of being misled by the producers).  Still, I'm glad it worked out the way it did so that we could have this amazing film.</p></body></html>

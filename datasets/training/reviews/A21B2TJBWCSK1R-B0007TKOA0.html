<meta name="summary" content="An ode to buddy films of the '70s..."></head><body><p>Payne's last film, About Schmidt, continued his fascination with American cinema in the `70s by featuring one its biggest (and most prolific) stars, Jack Nicholson. His latest movie, Sideways, continues the road movie motif from Schmidt and combines it with the buddy film. Jack (Haden Church) is a failed actor about to be married. He decides to go on one last week of uninhibited fun with his best friend, Miles (Giamatti), a school teacher and struggling author. They go on a wine-tasting tour through California's Central Coast and squeeze in a bit of golfing as well.<br /><br />Jack and Miles are complete messes as human beings. They lack direction and are hypocrites. Miles says he is an author but his book is going nowhere, while Jack is getting married and proceeds to hit on anything in a dress. They are hardly a sympathetic pair. And yet Payne is able to get a good amount of comedic mileage from the pair. An interesting thing happens during the course of the movie. At first, Miles starts off as an unsympathetic character while we warm up to Jack's funny repartee as the charming rogue. Halfway through the film they flip roles and it is Jack who is exposed as a pathetic womanizer and Miles becomes more sympathetic thanks to Maya's (Madsen) influence.<br /><br />Fresh off the success of American Splendor, Paul Giamatti is one of those actors who makes it look so effortless as he inhabits the characters he plays completely. Giamatti is able to tap into his character's deep reservoir of pain and anger and pull out an incredible performance that is, in some ways a variation of his take on the equally acerbic Harvey Pekar in Splendor.<br /><br />Ever since Ned and Stacey, Thomas Haden Church has been an untapped resource and with Sideways he has finally been given the role of his career. As Miles' crass, philandering best friend, he plays Jack as a middle-aged frat boy who still calls women, "chicks." Haden Church's deadpanned delivery of smart-ass lines works well against Giamatti's uptight straight man.<br /><br />20th Century Fox's recent DVD release includes a modest collection of supplemental material. There is an audio commentary by actors Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church. As a review in Entertainment Weekly has pointed out, this track is almost a sequel of sorts as Haden Church goes into vintage smart-ass mode while Giamatti plays the straight man and tries to keep things on track by occasionally commenting on what we are seeing. Haden Church then proceeds to deflate this by delivering ironic statements like, "Also, I love your head in this scene," in a deadpan style that is very funny.<br /><br />Also included are seven deleted scenes with written introductions by Payne that explain why they were cut. Most of this footage was rightly excised, including a nasty subplot involving a dog being hit and killed by Miles' car.<br /><br />Rounding out the DVD is a theatrical trailer and a "Behind-the-Scenes Featurette" that is pretty standard stuff with clips of Payne and the cast talking about the movie mixed with clips from the movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A consumate storyteller"></head><body><p>Pulp Fiction is now a classic.  It is the most satisfying of Tarrantino's movies as he artfully weaves together a compelling set of stories into a riveting film.  This film also saw the welcome return of John Travolta as a very hip hitman.  But, what distanced this movie from other &quot;art house&quot; action movies was Tarrantino's consumate skills as a storyteller.  &quot;The Watch&quot; was a wonderful piece, woven seamlessly into Bruce Willis' memorable role as the boxer.<p>Unfortunately, Tarrantino has not been able to match this effort in subsequent movies.  Pulp Fiction may go down as the Citizen Kane of the &quot;thrill kill&quot; generation. It brings together a great ensemble of actors playing their roles to the hilt.  Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic as the Ecclesiastics-driven killer.  Tarrantino may have made this look like an off-hand effort but there are few throw-away lines in this movie.  He ties all his stories together with a keen eye for social commentary. He has given a strange and even beautiful meaning to the chaotic world of violence we now find ourselves associated with, a definite notch about the Peckinpah-inspired violence of Reservoir Dogs.</p></body></html>

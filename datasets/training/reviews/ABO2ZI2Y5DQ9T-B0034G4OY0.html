<meta name="summary" content="Three Stories in Eastwood's Thoughtful and Quiet Drama; Maybe One Would Have Been Better"></head><body><p>In "Hereafter" are told three seemingly unrelated stories, about French news reporter Marie Lelay (C&eacute;cile De France), who survives the horrifying tsunami while on vacation; a San Francisco factory worker and retired psychic George Lonegan (Matt Damon), who considers his unusual abilities as a curse; and London twins Marcus and Jason (Frankie and George McLaren) living with their substance-addicted mother.<br /><br />I am not going to repeat what other reviewers have rightly said about Clint Eastwood's latest film. It is quiet and thoughtful (with the effectively moody cinematography from Tom Stern). This is not a supernatural thriller, but a drama about those who are trying to cope with the inevitable or, perhaps more precisely, its consequence. The theme is immediate and the film is well-intentioned, I know that for sure.<br /><br />With all respect to veteran director Clint Eastwood and the serious subject matter that is dealt here, however, narrative of "Hereafter" is disappointingly flat. It is not boring. It is, for lack of better word, predictable. About one hour in, you get where three stores are leading us, and the way the film is trying to reach there is not very compelling, but just contrived.<br /><br />Peter Morgan, screenwriter of "Frost/Nixon" fame, fails to invest his characters with enough personality to further each story. Many say the opening tsunami sequence looks hauntingly real. I agree. But I just don't see how Marie's near-death experience influenced her life after the shocking event. What these characters experience has profound dimensions, loss and sadness resonant to us all. Sadly, what they are (and do after their life-changing experiences) does not generate emotional resonance.</p></body></html>

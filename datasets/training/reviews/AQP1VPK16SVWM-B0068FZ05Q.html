In many respects, Bourne (Matt Damon)is the anti-Bond; he begins as an assassin but, robbed of his memory and hunted because of an assassination he failed to carry out, Bourne tries to stay alive as other assassins are sent to eliminate him. In the meantime, he tries to discover who he is and why they're trying to kill him. He meets Marie (Franka Potenta from &quot;Run, Lola, Run&quot;)and forces her to drive him to the apartment where he lived. While she's frightened, she's drawn to this mysterious and hurt soul.<br /><br /> Director Doug Liman (&quot;Go&quot;) and screenwriters Tony Gilroy (&quot;Proof of Life&quot;, &quot;The Devil's Advocate&quot;) & W. Blake Herron (the forthcoming &quot;Mr. Ripley's Return&quot;) have fashioned a marvelous spy thriller with a number of marvelous set pieces including the infamous carchase with the minis. Visually striking with strong performances by tne entire cast, &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; is a great way to spent an evening.<br /><br /> I wouldn't, however, recommend the re-release unless you haven't purchased the film previously. The alternate opening isn't quite finished and the alternate ending was available on the previous version on DVD. The biggest drawback, though, is the fact that this edition doesn't have an audio commentary track by director Liman. While there are a number of extras (they are highlighted in the amazon.com list of new features) here that are new, this really isn't all that different from the previous version. If you haven't seen the movie yet, this edition does have a free &quot;ticket&quot; to the sequel so that might entice someone who has rented but not purchased the movie before to get this. Having seen both editions, the transfer appears to be the exact same digital transfer from last year.<br /><br /> A great spy thriller of the type Hitchcock might have made if he were 35 years old and just starting out making movies, &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; is well worth purchasing but if you bought it before you may want to seriously reconsider getting this edition.</p></body></html>

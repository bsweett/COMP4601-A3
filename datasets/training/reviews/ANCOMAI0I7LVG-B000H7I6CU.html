As was brought to my attention by a fellow Ammy buddy, I do tend to be extra harsh to films that seem to get `undeserved' praise and attention.  I feel at times like I need to knock them down a peg.  I think that, for the most part, the world agrees that `Cars' is one of Pixar's weakest films.  They may not loathe it as I do, but I don't think anyone is going to try and make a case for `Cars' being a better film than `Up' or `Finding Nemo'.  What I find upsetting is that people actually like this film at all.<br /><br />It's not funny, it's not witty, it's not charming, it's not fresh, it's not exciting, it's not really much of anything other than a complete waste of time.<br /><br />UGH, I hate this movie.<br /><br />The film tells the story of a selfish hotshot race car who gets lost on his way to an important race and winds up doing some heavy damage to a road in Radiator Springs.  He can't leave until he helps fix what he's done, and in the process his eyes are opened and his life is changed (or at least his `outlook' on that life).  He meets an array of shiny (and rusty) new friends (well, not at first) who teach him some valuable life lessons.<br /><br />The film is shiny, but at the same time it is rather one-note.  The voice acting is effective, not nothing truly noteworthy.  The plot is simple and rather `cookie cutter', and that isn't helped by the lackluster script that layers that characters with clich&eacute; dialog and gags that are almost mind-numbing in their inability to illicit a genuine response from the audience (and by audience I mean ME since I am the only audience that matters in my personal opinion of this film).<br /><br />In a word, this film is just `boring'.</p></body></html>

Reunited with his estranged father, Talbot sets out to find his brother... and discovers a horrifying destiny for himself. Talbot's childhood ended the night his mother died. After he left the sleepy Victorian hamlet of Blackmoor, he spent decades recovering and trying to forget. But when his brother's fianc&eacute;e, Gwen Conliffe, tracks him down to help find her missing love, Talbot returns home to join the search. He learns that something with brute strength and insatiable bloodlust has been killing the villagers, and that a suspicious Scotland Yard inspector named Aberline has come to investigate.<br /><br />The performances in the movie were absolutely fantastic. Benicio Del Toro, Anthony Hopkins, Hugo Weaving, and Emily Blunt all delivered and really brought their characters to life. It's always good to have great performances in a horror movie. The action sequences are pretty exciting and they'll keep you at the edge of your seat. Just when you think it's safe, something crazy happens and mayhem ensues. The 'kills' are also pretty awesome. The werewolf in this movie is pretty insane, so expect to see a lot of blood, gore, and human body parts flying around all over the place. The violence, along with the dark atmosphere, really gave a suspenseful experience. The pacing of the movie starts off slow to introduce the characters and setting, and then all of a sudden kicks to high gear and then goes back to a slow pace again. Finally, the ending wasn't that great. But overall, "The Wolfman" is a pretty decent horror movie.</p></body></html>

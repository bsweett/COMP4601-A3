<meta name="summary" content="Cool zombies, but needed a better script"></head><body><p>When you are tackling a genre that has been so overdone as zombie movies (ok, they're plague-infected people, but they sure act like zombies) you need to do something different. I'm not a zombie afficiando so maybe some of the things I liked have been done before, but I thought it was exciting that someone became infected within 10 to 20 seconds. It doesn't give you much time to determine whether they're infected or to defend yourself. I also liked the fact that the zombies moved fast, not dragging along like snails. The beginning of the film where the main character, Jim, wakes up in the hospital, not knowing about the plague because he had been in a car accident, is very well done. It was easy to imagine that was yourself trying to figure out where everyone was and what had happened. There is a very creepy scene in a church when Jim is rescued from a pack of zombies by other non-infected people. After this the movie slows down quite a bit while Jim and Selena argue and meet other survivors. There is some talk during these scenes about needing to have something to survive for, not just survive. I guess this elevates the movie slightly, but its done pretty superficially and a little too easily.<br /><br />It almost becomes another movie after that. The survivors follow a radio transmission to Manchester and find a small military band in an armed fortress. They think they'll be safe until they find out the commander promised his men women which is why he put out the broadcast in the first place. Lucky them that the only people to show up are 2/3 female and young and attractive at that. Jim is supposed to be executed to get him out of the way but he escapes due to the soldiers utter stupidity. Then this former bicycle courier manages to out-maneuver trained military personnel to rescue the women. Including along the way releasing a captured zombie, who immediately attacks everyone in sight thus creating more zombies. Brilliant idea.<br /><br />This was a decent movie that lost its way with a slow pace and plot contrivances that made you stop believing any of it was real.</p></body></html>

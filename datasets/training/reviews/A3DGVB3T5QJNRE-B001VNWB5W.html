<meta name="summary" content="A Sobering Story About The Stupidity Of The Human Race!"></head><body><p>This story was written back in the 1980's when the Cold War was still unfolding. Those who are too young to remember the fear of nuclear war and that the Commies would someday be knocking on our doors -are lucky! It's sad to say, but ALL wars from the Korean to Vietnam, and every other war Americans funded throughout the world - in mostly poor, Third World nations - were all caused by the never ending Cold War! Keep in mind these numerous wars cost millions of lives and many billions of dollars! Watchmen, while a fantasy, is certainly realistic when it comes to the fear many people around the world felt. (And, this is an era, which should be carefully studied by every student in the United States before graduating high school, but I digress....)<br /><br />In Watchmen there are very few good guys! The violence is so gruesome at times I had to repeatedly cover my eyes! And I'm in my 40's! I WANT TO WARN PARENTS THIS FILM IS NOT SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN AND YOUNG TEENS! If the gruesome scenes of violence don't disturb them, they need to get some help! While the Watchmen is a fantasy/science fiction/drama/chick flick -it's also a horror film! This is NOT some cutesy Super Hero story!<br /><br />Watchmen is an important film, which will soon be forgotten because of the extreme violence and, at the same time, for it's deep political message. This is also an anti-Republican and anti-conservative film -as blatantly political as you can get! This is the part of the story I love! While Richard Nixon and the toady Henry Kissinger were no dummies by any stretch of the imagination, they both were accurately portrayed as morally bankrupt and plain crazy! But the bottom line here is that the majority of voting Americans vote these monsters into office and then collectively shrug their shoulders when rotten things happen! To say that the Watchmen is a sobering story about the sheer stupidity of the human race in general - and the American people, specifically,  is an understatement!<br /><br />See: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/027599435X">Who Benefits from Global Violence and War: Uncovering a Destructive System (Contemporary Psychology)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1859846319">The Trial of Henry Kissinger</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0813341124">The Skull Beneath The Skin: Africa After The Cold War</a><br /><br />For a MUCH more entertaining approach to Science Fiction/Fantasy see:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059HAE">Zardoz</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000059HAC">Enemy Mine</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TZN7KQ">Fantastic Planet</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXXP">A.I. - Artificial Intelligence (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/630587493X">Bicentennial Man</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001S86J0I">Galaxy Quest (Deluxe Edition)</a></p></body></html>

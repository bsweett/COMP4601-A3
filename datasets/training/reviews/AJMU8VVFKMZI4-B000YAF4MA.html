Maybe it's a clue for all us to start on our bucket lists sooner rather than later.  Still, as a film it's not very memorable.  I saw it a week ago and I'm just remembering that I watched it and needed to post a review.  Nicholson is Nicholson and of course Morgan Freeman is narrating. (If it ain't broke then don't fix it, eh?) Overall, it's just okay.</p></body></html>

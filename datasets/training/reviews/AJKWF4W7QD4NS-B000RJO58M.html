<meta name="summary" content="Incredibly funny"></head><body><p>From the same crew that brought us the smashing Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz gleefully satires the mainstream, tough guy, bug budget, bullet-laden action films that big studios always push out on us.  Simon Pegg stars as supercop Nicholas Angel, whose action filled career in the big city comes to an unexpected end when he is reassigned to a quiet, quaint, and overly boring village.  Or so we think.  Soon enough, people start meeting mysterious, and bloody, demises, and Angel suspects foul play is afoot.  Teaming up with the dim-witted Danny (Nick Frost), Angel soon finds himself over his head to say the least.  Make no mistake that Hot Fuzz is incredibly funny and instantly enjoyable for those who enjoyed Shaun of the Dead and longtime action movie junkies alike.  Director Edgar Wright and co-writer/star Pegg clearly have a love for the genre that allows them to have such casual fun, even though the film never feels like the labor of love that Shaun of the Dead did.  Despite that though, Hot Fuzz is a blast (if a bit overlong) and features a bevy of star talent including Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton, Bill Nighy, Kenneth Cranham, and a blink and you'll miss it cameo from Cate Blanchett.</p></body></html>

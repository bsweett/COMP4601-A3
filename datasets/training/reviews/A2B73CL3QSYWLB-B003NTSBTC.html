<meta name="summary" content="Marty Does It Again"></head><body><p>In the twilight of his career director Martin Scorsese continues to amaze.  Not content to rest on his laurels after wresting the elusive Oscar (if he ever pursued it in the first place) Scorsese pushes and challenges himself and creates a work unlike anything in his canon.  Though the influence of Kubrick and Hitchcock are apparent "Shutter Island" is unique and original and totally Marty.  I could also see the influence of Shyamalan before he fell out of favor.  It would behoove Shyamalan to view this film so he can get his career back on track.  "Shutter Island" is a complex film that demands close attention sort of like a jigsaw puzzle where the true picture isn't apparent until all the interlocking pieces are connected.  I may have to qualify that because the ending does contain a certain level of ambiguity.  Along with "Inception", which coincidentally stars Leonardo DiCaprio as well, this may be the best picture so far this year.</p></body></html>

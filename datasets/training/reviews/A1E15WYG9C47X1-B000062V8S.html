<meta name="summary" content="A Very Impressive Conclusion"></head><body><p>I really enjoyed Terminator 3, contrary to my negative expectations.<br />After nearly a decade since the huge commercial success in both theaters and DVD market of Terminator 2,a film that James Cameron has invested so much technically, and creativally, I had a slight aversion towards this third installement, being disappointed before with similar revivals of classic films like Star Wars, but I was very much surprised by how well this film is made, and I made few observations,<br />First I felt that T3 was closest to the original Terminator film. T2 was surely a very ambitious and exciting and extravagantly directed film, but it had something which personally I found off putting: The robot/terminator had a deeper almost three dimensional approach..a robot who experiences human feelings is an angle that can easily fall in the trap of the one S word I hate in  movies, sentimentality.<br />Speilberg fell into that trap in AI and Cameron did border it in T2.<br />(The only robot with human feelings movie that works so well is Ridley Scott's masterpiece Blade Runner).<br />So the fresh thing about T3 is the fact that the terminator returns to his non-nonsense tough self with a very determined mission, and no time for cheesy emotions,quite similar to the first film.<br />The other fresh addition is of course Kristanna Loken. She adds an invaluable sexiness to the movie, a deadly and very pretty robot..not unlike Natasha Hentsridge in Species minus the nudity and love scenes.<br />Jonathan Mostow's direction was very good, and all the cast played their roles very well..but it is Arnold Shwarzenegger that I was mostly impressed with.<br />He is back on top form, and with the aid of make up and a still super fit body, he appears to be more comfortable than he was in any of his recent roles.<br />And while he traded signing film contracts and carrying guns, with signing legislations and carrying babies, in T3 he was able to demonstrate that the huge fan base he has acquired over the years was the result of the tough charisma and the cheeky humour he posesses.<br />And T3 is full of funny lines.<br />One example: When terminator goes with Stahl and Danes's characters to see Danes father, he says is a straight faced manner: 'We can reach CRS in an hour depending on the traffic! which I found hilarious!<br />T3 is also full of non stop action, a roller coaster of a ride that is crammed with very impressive digital trickery that will have you gasp in amazement.<br />Finally, I was totally surprised by the ending! a twist that will truly shock you and a perfect end to the movie.<br />So, thanks to producers Mario Kassar and Andrew G Vajna and to Jonathan Mostow and 'Governor' Shwarzenegger that this franchise was revived again to give us a very entertaining movie, full of heart pounding stunts, pleasent humour and a DVD experience you can enjoy over and over again.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""W." is brilliant!"></head><body><p>"W." is brilliant! This is how the story goes: W. takes viewers through Bush's eventful life -- his struggles and triumphs, how he found both his wife and his faith, and of course the critical days leading up to Bush's decision to invade Iraq.<br /><br />The cast led by Josh Brolin (in an brilliant career-best performance as George W. Bush) is excellent! The directing by Oliver Stone (who also directed "World Trade Center" (2006), "Platoon" (1986, Stone won his first Oscar for Best Director, also wrote the screenplay and story and had a cameo in the film), "Wall Street" (1987, which won Michael Douglas his Best Actor Oscar, also wrote the screenplay and story and also had a cameo in the film), "Born On The Fourth Of July" (1989, which Stone won his second Oscar for Best Director and also wrote the screenplay and produced, and also had a cameo in the film), and the upcoming "Pinkville" (2009, also produced), he also directed "Any Given Sunday" (1999, also wrote the screenplay and executive produced and had a cameo in the film), wrote the Oscar-winning screenplay to "Midnight Express" (1978), also wrote the screenplay and directed and produced "JFK" (1991) is brilliant! The screenplay by Stanley Weiser (who also wrote the screenplay and story to "Wall Street" with Stone and was a project consultant on "Any Given Sunday", and was thanked on the end credits of "Nixon" (1995, which was written (story and screenplay), produced, and directed by Stone) is brilliant!<br /><br />The music by Paul Cantelon (who also did the music to "The Other Boleyn Girl" (2008) & "The Diving Bell And The Butterfly" (2007) is brilliant! The cinematography by Phedon Papamichael (who also did the cinematography to "3:10 To Yuma" (2007, which was directed by James Mangold), "The Pursuit Of Happiness" (2006), "Walk The Line" (2005, which was also directed by Mangold), & "Identity" (2003, which was also directed by Mangold) is brilliant! The film editing by Julie Monroe (who also did the film editing to "World Trade Center" & the upcoming "Pinkville", she also did work on Stone's "JFK" (associate editor), "The Doors" (1991, which Stone wrote (story and screenplay) and directed) (first assistant editor), "Born On The Fourth Of July" (first assistant film editor), "Wall Street" (assistant editor), "Platoon" (assistant editor), & "Salvador" (1986, which Stone wrote the screenplay and story, and produced and directed) (assistant editor) is excellent! The casting by Sarah Finn (who also did the casting to the upcoming "Pinkville", & "Fast & Furious" (2009), she also did the casting to "Pride And Glory" (2008), "You Don't Mess With The Zohan" (2008), & "Iron Man" (2008) is brilliant!  The production design by Derek Hill (who also did the production design to the upcoming "Pinkville", he also did the production design to "Into The Wild" (2007), also did work as set decorator on Stone's "Born On The Fourth Of The July" & "Talk Radio" (1988, Stone wrote the screenplay and directed), was art director on "Any Given Sunday" & "JFK") is excellent! The art direction by Alex Hajdu (who also did the art direction to "The Mist" (2007) & John Richardson (who also did the art direction to "Into The Wild") is excellent! The set decoration by Mel Cooper is excellent! The costume design by Michael Dennison (who also did the costume design to "World Trade Center" & the upcoming "Pinkville", he also did the costume design to the upcoming "The Spirit" (2008), "Mirrors" (2008), & "The Eye" (2008) is excellent!<br /><br />This is an brilliant and possible, fictional account of Bush's life leading up to his decision to invade Iraq. Josh Brolin will possibly get an Oscar nomination and many other award recognitions for his brilliant performance. This is one of the best films of the year!</p></body></html>

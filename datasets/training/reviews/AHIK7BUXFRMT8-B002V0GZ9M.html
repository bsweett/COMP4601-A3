<meta name="summary" content="A Delightful Fantasy"></head><body><p>This is one of those movies that requires one to accept a certain set of premises; if you can do that, you're in, if you can't, you're out. Both my wife and I were able to accept the fantasy elements of the movie so we wound up really enjoying it.<br /><br />This movie brings Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves back together for the first time since "Speed" in 1994. Together they create a compelling chemistry which held our attention completely; it created a concern for them and the awkward situation in which they found themselves.<br /><br />This is a good family movie that brings excitement and suspense to the viewer with the bonus of a happy ending.<br /><br />I recommend it highly!</p></body></html>

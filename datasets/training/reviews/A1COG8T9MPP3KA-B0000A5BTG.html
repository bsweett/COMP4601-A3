Looking for a money making blockbuster ay?<br />The latest in special effects natural disaster movies..<br />I disagree with others and refuse to rave about the cheesy effects in this film. I do agree it is smarter than &quot;Armegeddon&quot; and can be fun as &quot;Journey To The Center Of The Earth&quot;..<br />But you can guess with accuracy who will survive and who will die.<br />I loved the Geode scene however. I laughed how the ship  just popped out of an ocean vent at the end ...Good for mind numbing entertainment. I still don't understand Hillary's interest in this project.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An effective little chiller"></head><body><p>One of my friends is a huge fan of the recent onslaught of horror films: namely those that center on gore (Saw, Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake and prequel) or those that center on 10 jump scenes meant to scare you out of your seat but really show the story didn't have bite in the first place and needed those jumps. But as bad as he's been getting, Stephen King can come up with a few effective books which turn out to be either really great (The Shining, The Green Mile), manageable (The Langoliers) or just simply awful (Dreamcatcher). 1408 may not be the best adaptation of one of his films but it's certainly the best in awhile.<br /><br />Michael Enslin is a writer who specializes in the most haunted places in America. Well at least if they were actually haunted since a lot of them have been disappointing and he's been growing increasingly cynical. But a curious postcard about the Dolphin Hotel in New York with the phrase "Don't Enter 1408" appears. This sparks his interest and despite the continued warnings from the hotel manager,Gerald Olin, he checks in. What initially begins as disbelief soon grows into a fear that the room may in fact be real.<br /><br />A lot of horror movies are based on the idea that you're not safe as long as the film's on and with good use of atmosphere and tension, the film just might make you lose sleep. However, films lately are built around the idea that seeing entrails and "chunky goodness" is meant to scare you. Well it doesn't, it disgusts so it's with welcome that 1408 doesn't follow this route. Well there's only so much scary stuff to go around but it's a good use of letting the viewer feel uneasy. It also helps that we never leave the main character to sort of deflate everything which is a big plus.<br /><br />But that means that main character better be awesome right? Well how can you expect less from John Cusack, one of the more reliable actors right now. He's always been great and here he shines as well, showing the cynicism, shock and tortured past that the character has without it feeling hammy or "actor"-ish. The other main character is obviously Samuel L. Jackson (since he's on the cover, naturally) and Sam's always good but here he doesn't have much to do except for telling us how evil the room is. We also have Mary McCormack and Tony Shalhoub with only Mary being anything close to a full character.<br /><br />With the Mist coming from Green Mile director and Cell from Hostel director Eli Roth (ugh) coming, it seems either people are seeing how effective a Stephen King story can be under a good director it's just simply the thing to do lately but luckily 1408 is as good a horror film out this year as any.</p></body></html>

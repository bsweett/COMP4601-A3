<meta name="summary" content="Best Picture? You Bet!"></head><body><p>Hard to believe, but this hard-edged musical fantasy not only won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 2002, it is also arguably the best piece of filmaking to come out of a Hollywood studio this decade.  Back in the bad old 1970s, when Broadway musical director and sometimes filmaker Bob Fosse first produced the stage version of &quot;Chicago,&quot; stories thiss brutally honest (some would say cynical) dominated the movie industry.  Only because most Hollywood films have become so dumbed down and mediocre in recent years does &quot;Chicago&quot; seem like a bracing breath of fresh air.<p>The movie's highlights includes tremendous performances from ts three stars (who would have thought Rene Zellweger and Richard Gere could sing and dance so well?).  The songs are memorable, as is the witty between song dialog.  As a bonus, the DVD contains plenty of extras, including a &quot;making of&quot; featurette, and interviews with the Director and stars.<p>Overall, a very worthy film presented in a very worthwhile DVD package.</p></body></html>

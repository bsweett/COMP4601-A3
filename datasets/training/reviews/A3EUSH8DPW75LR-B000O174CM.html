<meta name="summary" content="This film is one thing - JENNIFER HUDSON"></head><body><p>People acted so shocked when DREAMGIRLS was not nominated for best film at the Oscars.  Well, it didn't deserve it.<br /><br />I saw the original Broadway cast and it was an amazing experience - so much more than had been managed on Broadway before.  It was excellent even without the showstopper song.  The music told the story more than the acting.<br /><br />In the movie, the music lost all the intensity it had on stage.  They wanted names - Beyonce, Jamie Foxx - fine, but their acting and vocals didn't bring the emotional impact of the originals.<br /><br />The only character that did was Effie.  Ms. Jennifer Hudson didn't try to copy Jennifer Holliday - who could.  She made it her own.  Her acting was the most believable in the film and when she sang - she SANG.  That girl spoke more emotion through the songs than all the other actors did throughout the entire film.  Her Oscar was mor than deserved and not only for AND I AM TELLING YOU.<br /><br />Otherwise, the adaption was a mess.  When thet sang the song FAMILY and then Jennifer and Jamie went outside arguing they were in the middle of the riots complete with gunshots.  How unrealistic.  if all this was happening outside would they have all just been sitting in the theatre.<br /><br />And on the stage, when the song DREAMGIRLS was performed, as the group transitioned, it was magical. You were lost in it.  It was such a let down in the film.  The vocals didn't make it soar and even the shooting, editing of it certainly lost an opportunity to shine.<br /><br />For me, this movie made me wish the stage magic could have been brought to film.  It was e reminder of a memory.  Beyonce was stiff and some of the worst acting by Jamie so far.<br /><br />I would give this film 3 stars as an ill fated attempt but Jennifer Hudson made the material shine and anyone who had a scene with her looked better.  When she sang you wanted to stand, clap and shout as if you were seeing it live.  Jennifer Hudson - for you - I AM TELLING YOU - I have to give the film 4 stars. You deserve a career with much opportunities.<br /><br />Jennifer - your beautiful, emotional voice has certainly touched me and made this film something I will watch over and over, just for you.</p></body></html>

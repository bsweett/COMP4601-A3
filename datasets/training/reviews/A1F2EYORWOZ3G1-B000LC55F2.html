<meta name="summary" content="A great movie"></head><body><p>I've read the other reviews just to see what they said. I happen to think this was a great film.<br /><br />The story was strong and convincing as well as the acting. The sets and costumes were fantastic.<br /><br />The story here was not the sleight of hand or illusion, but the competition. How far would anyone go to seek revenge? And just how would that revenge effect the one seeking it?<br /><br />Truly an original story here filled with mystery, doubt, revenge and the illusions that surround us. All the players are in fine form here. Each one fleshes out their character quite well and play into the common theme dynamically.<br /><br />If you like a good mystery that is tense and driven, then this is the film for you. A rare trip as of late as most mysteries have to be gore or flesh driven. But not this one. All Hitchcock and DePalma fans will love this one.</p></body></html>

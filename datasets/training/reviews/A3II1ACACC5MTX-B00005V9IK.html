And then the wheels come off big style. Lots to like in this film, V-Style giant dustbin lid flying saucers, lots of action, but the gung-ho lameness of the "USA, USA" patriotism is the sort of stuff that has the 5 and three quarter billion people in the world who are not American covering their eyes with embarrassment. It is somehow fitting that the climax to the film involves Randy Quaid flying up the bottom of one of the giant binlids..still, as a man, we need a fix of explosions and aliens and jets and stuff like that, and there is plenty of that going on. And just in case you think I'm a big meany, I quite liked Battlefield Earth apart from the hideously lame end (and insult to all Harrier Jump-Jet Pilots everywhere), and "War of the Worlds" which also had a totally lame end, although I'm sure a positive impact on real-estate prices in downtown Boston (handy for the shops and alien proof!). I'm sure that if an ill tempered alien race had the technology to send a fleet of giant binlids interstellar distances, they could crush us like ants without even taking their alien sausage sandwiches out of their mouths.<br /><br />Mind you, if they did arrive, I expect that the Number One quisling collaborator in their alien conquest would be Tom Cruise. Why, he is probably talking to them already, by e-mail. Why does this tinfoil hat make my head itch?</p></body></html>

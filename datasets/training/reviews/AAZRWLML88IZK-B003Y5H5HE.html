<meta name="summary" content="Hugo"></head><body><p>The 84th Academy Awards are officially in our collective rear view mirror, and though Hugo didn't take home statues for any of the top honors, Martin Scorsese's love letter to the cinema did score a solid five Oscars. Based on the best-selling Brian Selznick novel, The Invention of Hugo Cabret, the film stars Asa Butterfield as the titular boy, the orphaned son of a clockmaker who loved the films of Georges Melies. In his quest to repair the mysterious automaton that his late father left behind, Hugo befriends a young girl named Isabelle whose toymaker godfather may or may not be intimately connected to his father's automaton. Lavishly shot in 3D, Hugo evokes a strong sense of cinematic nostalgia, demonstrating Martin Scorsese's very personal love for the magic of the movies, and it's a delightful treat for all families, whether they're full of cinephiles or not. Now, it is available in Blu-ray 3D, but whether or not it will be able to duplicate the lush effects seen in theaters is still sort of up in the air; here's hoping they re-release it for a post-Oscar run.</p></body></html>

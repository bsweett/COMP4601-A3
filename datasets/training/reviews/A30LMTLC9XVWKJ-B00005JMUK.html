<meta name="summary" content="A Different Kind of Love Story"></head><body><p>While IMHO "Monster" is an absolutely amazing film, it obviously is not going to be everyone's cup of tea. But the only reasons for criticism are writer/director Patty Jenkins' exploitation of a real-life situation and the perception that serial killer Aileen is portrayed as more of a victim that those she murdered. While there is some logic to those arguments, I think Jenkins actually showed considerable restraint. Exploitation and character identification are inevitable in this type of story. It is more a question of degree-if you compare this to 1990's tearjerker "Too Young to Die" (starring Juliette Lewis in an almost identical story), Jenkins comes off as a model of objectivity and distanced perspective.<br /><br />What is most unique and compelling about "Monster" is that it is much more a love story than a thriller or a crime drama. The two main love scenes are absolutely riveting, with intensity levels higher than you are likely to find in any other film. "Tide Is High" and "Crimson and Clover" will never sound the same.<br /><br />One thing that works unexpectedly well is the incredible contrast between the two characters. Jenkins works hard to emphasize this, with camera shots that emphasize the physical size differences coupled with dialogue and behaviors that emphasize the contrasting personalities of this odd pair. Having Scott Wilson play the last murder victim is a homage to an earlier "Mutt and Jeff" pair of murderers, as he played Robert Blake's "In Cold Blood" sidekick.<br /><br />Although most of the critical acclaim has gone to Theron for her portrayal of Aileen, I think that a lot of the credit for Theron's masterful performance should go to Ricci's subtle and nuanced portrayal of Selby. Watch Ricci's eyes in all her reaction shots, it is as close to acting for the camera perfection as you are likely to ever see.<br /><br />If you really enjoyed Theron's incredible transformation from her typical hot starlet to this gritty prostitute role, then check out Catherine Deneuve in "Repulsion" (1965) and "Belle de jour" (1967). While not as physically extreme as Theron's transformation, Deneuve's two characters are equally hard to reconcile as being played by the same actress. Yet another acting for the camera marvel, as wardrobe, makeup, and hair-styling combine with behaviors and speech to effect an amazing range between two characters played by the same actress.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</p></body></html>

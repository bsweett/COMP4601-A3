<meta name="summary" content="What really happened to the 2nd Avenue el!"></head><body><p>Interpretations--psychological, anthropological, social, evolutionary, racial--abound about 1933's KING KONG. &quot;King Kong is about our inner animal of rage&quot;, &quot;King Kong is a critique of man in modern urban times&quot;, &quot;King Kong is about technology killing our true nature...&quot; Ad infinitum, ad nauseum.<p>PUH-LEASE! KING KONG is simply a great story, perfectly directed, with the best animation techniques for its time. While the acting (by humans) is admittedly the weakest link in this film, it has so much else going for it, like suspense, horror, pathos, love, and tragedy. King Kong, the animal, is complex and there are different emotions we experience about him. We don't like him when he gobbles up people or smashes the 2nd Avenue el (an incredible scene!). We admire him for trying to save Fay Wray from the flashbulbs. And we feel incredibly sad when he's killed. Why? I think it's because we see him as a human, at least of having human qualities. But to extend that to some deeper, intellectual level is pointless. It's just an amazing film.<p>Last comment: The film also has some humor. As a New Yorker, I love the dialogue between the two women at the theater, waiting to see King Kong.<p>Girl one: &quot;Hey, what's this show about, anyway?&quot;<br />Girl two: &quot;I don't know. Some big gorilla.&quot;<br />Girl one: (after a clod accidentally steps on her toe): &quot;Aw. Ain't we got enough of them in New Yawk?&quot;<p>I can't get enough of this classic film.</p></body></html>

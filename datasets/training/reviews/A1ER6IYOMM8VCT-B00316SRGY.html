<meta name="summary" content="IT'S THE END OF THE WORLD AS "I" KNOW IT!"></head><body><p>Clint Eastwood gives us a multi-layered gem that some may find contrived and clich&eacute;d, but under the hood of this slick and powerful film lies an all too truthful look at what our world has become!<br /><br />The film is gripping from the opening credits to the very end and even though at times it seems a little heavy handed, it's blatant truth is really the film's genius. Apparently, Clint Eastwood can do no wrong, as I can't see anyone else getting away with this film. It's really a wonderful piece of work that speaks volumes about the world we live in.<br /><br />The film is full of wry wit and I laughed through much of this entertaining, but sad film. At times I couldn't help, but think of Dirty Harry and like the Duke in 'The Shootest' this film seems like a beautiful tribute to one of our most endeared actors. This film is not just a shinning classic muscle car, but a dark and deep drama that echoes the reality of our world today.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this "in your face" look at our sadly deteriorating society and also a film that doesn't apologize for using "politically incorrect" language. Of course we learn that you can't judge a book by it's cover and that stereotyping is unfair and wrong, but it's a part of society and it shouldn't be swept under the rug.<br /><br />I can only hope some spineless moron in charge of content for films released on DVD will not alter this film years from now.(Yes Disney I'm referring to you!)<br /><br />The DVD has a very good transfer, but the extras are disappointing on this single disc edition.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="SIGOURNEY'S STAR IS BORN"></head><body><p>In 1979, this became THE sci-fi horror film of the century.  It also launched the stellar career of Sigourney Weaver, who embodies the perfect female battling machine as Ripley.  What's amazing is that the second in the series, ALIENS, is even better.  But there's not much wrong with this trendsetting flick.  The movie has several classic scenes including the "facehugger", the "chestbuster" and the final confrontation in the shuttle.  Director Ridley Scott keeps everything threatening and ominous, and was wise to redo the movie to give it more light.  When I saw it in the theaters, it was so dark it was hard to tell what was going on at times, but this revision sparkles with clarity without losing the darkness of the film.  Giger's creation of the alien is truly one of the most terrifying in film history and everyone in the cast is superb:  Ian Holm as the android Ash; Tom Skerritt as the stalwart Captain Dallas; Yaphet Kotto as blustery Parker; Veronica Cartwright (originally supposed to play Ripley) as the whiny Lambert; John Hurt as the doomed Kane; and Harry Dean Stanton as common man Brett.  ALIEN certainly set a standard which hundreds of movies have tried to copy, but the first two in this series have been untouched.  A classic film.</p></body></html>

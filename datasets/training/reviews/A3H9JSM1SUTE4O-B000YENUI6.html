<meta name="summary" content="VIGGO ELECTRIFIES IN RUSSIAN MAFIA THRILLER"></head><body><p>Viggo Mortensen's understated electrifying performance in this Russian mafia thriller will linger long after the movie ends.  A far more complex and minimalist character than that of Daniel Day-Lewis and his silly, over wrought Plainview psycho in the bloody pointless "There Will Be Blood."<br /><br />The story may be somewhat familiar, but it's in the details of this London based tale that make it fresh.<br /><br />Mortensen's Nikolai is a man who says he has been dead since he was 15.  He is a moral force with nothing to lose.  A man beyond redemption perhaps who suddenly sees clearly what must be tended to in the battle of light and darkness.<br /><br />Croneberg's fascination with cut flesh is a little off-putting in the few violent moments and took me out of the movie.<br /><br />The fight scene in the bathhouse is the most intense I can recall.  Reminded me of the extended struggle in the train in "From Russia With Love."<br /><br />Brutal and raw.  A great double feature with the London blackmarket body parts thriller "Dirty Pretty things."<br /><br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

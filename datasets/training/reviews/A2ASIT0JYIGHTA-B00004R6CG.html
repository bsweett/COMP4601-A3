<meta name="summary" content="Classic?  Not quite ..."></head><body><p>Do you know how long I've wanted to see Vertigo? For years! Simply because of all the fuss over it. I recently got hold of the restored print DVD and looked forward to seeing the film that is known as Hitchcock's masterpiece.<p>Sitting through the first hour I was confused at what exactly all the fuss was about. The first hour dragged, and nothing significant seemed to happen (other reviewers have also mentioned the slowness of the film). Ten minutes into the second hour, the movie started to pick up. However, I kept waiting for the fantastic storyline to unfold that I had been promised, but it didn't really eventuate. It's not the complex film I was expecting.<p>The problem with Vertigo, as I see it, is that the storyline is quite basic and not overly interesting. The film didn't do well at the box office on its initial release either which is a significant point - moviegoers hated it back then for its slowness. For it to become the classic it has become can only be for the following reasons: Hitchcock loved it over all his other films, Hitchcock is no longer with us, and Kim Novak was in it. it was her only major film. I've never seen the appeal with Jimmy Stewart, and wonder why Hitchcock used him so often. <p>All these things said, Vertigo is one of those films that you will want to see at least once ... to see what all the fuss is about. Sadly, you will still be left wondering &quot;what is all the fuss about?&quot;<br /><br /> DVD SUMMARY: American die-hard fans will want to purchase the Australian DVD which has a widescreen anamorphic presentation. The American DVD is widescreen letterbox (urgh). However, both versions contain the same extras.</p></body></html>

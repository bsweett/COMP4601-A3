I saw it theatrically in the summer of 2003 and then I saw it yet again on DVD very recently.  A seamless melange of martial arts, science fiction, and Christian overtones, 1999's &quot;Matrix&quot; was both an unexpected smash hit and ignited a cultural phenomenon in the age of digital video.  The Wachowski brothers, who directed the movie, were faced with the daunting task of topping themselves, which they don't quite do on the sequel &quot;Reloaded.&quot;  Here is a film that's intermittently thrilling, sometimes boring, and often confusing.  Never mind that Keanau Reeves, as an actor, is as wooden as mahogany furniture; what really matters are the stunts, which range from good to breathtaking.  Highlights include an extended car chase and a scene featuring Neo (Reeves) going to battle with tens of Smiths (the underrated Hugo Weaving).  New to the cast is the ever-striking Jada Pinkett Smith, who, as Niobe, doesn't have much to work with, but makes the most of what little screen time she is given.  But as soon as the action stops, &quot;Reloaded&quot; hits some bumps with long stretches of dialogue that, quite frankly, are tedious to listen to.  And there's a long, pointless &quot;rave scene&quot; that seems to go on and on and doesn't quite fit in with the rest of the picture.  If any clip belongs in the &quot;deleted scenes&quot; section, it's this one.  While I'm not as rabid a fan of &quot;The Matrix&quot; as some people are, I was somewhat entertained by &quot;Reloaded.&quot;  But for all its stunning visuals I couldn't help noticing that it also lacked the unexpected punch of its predecessor.  Maybe a better title for this movie would have been &quot;The Matrix Unloaded.&quot;</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Illusionist"></head><body><p>Adapted from a Steven Millhauser story and set to a lilting score by Philip Glass, Neil Burger's fanciful tale of love and deception in turn-of-the-century Europe is an intriguing and highly entertaining art house gem with Hollywood-style production values. Norton is mystifying, Biel is ravishing, and Giamatti holds it all together with a fine performance as the inspector whose respect for Eisenheim nearly outweighs his official duty. Drenched in sepia tones that evoke the Victorian atmosphere, "The Illusionist" is a murderous bluff that never shows its hand--until the final curtain.</p></body></html>

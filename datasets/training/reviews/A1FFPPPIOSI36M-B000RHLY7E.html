<meta name="summary" content="movie is repulsive"></head><body><p>I hated this movie simply because it was so mean spirited. The jist of the movie is so ridiculously pro-murderer that you have to really examine your ethics if you like this movie.<br /><br />THis movie has no suspense, scares or thrills. The charactors are vicious sadists who kill for joy. It is one thing when the violence is intense because it adds to how scary the charactor was, or because it makes a climax, where the killer gets their due, more intense. However, this movie just minimalizes the lives of innocent victims. What was the point?<br /><br />In "Texas CHainsaw", the family was sadistic, but that led to the intense horror of what the victim was going through. it made her escape all the more gratifying. All the zombie movies, where they show gore galore is fine, because it illustrates the horror of being eaten alive.<br /><br />Violence, without a story telling purpose, is just plain mean.<br /><br />This movie transforms the 3 murderous family members, at the end, into a Bonnie and Clyde, folk heros, which was illogical.<br /><br />I hated this movie so much because it seems as though it advocated and glorified violence, murder, and sexual assault onto innocent people. This has no redeeming value.</p></body></html>

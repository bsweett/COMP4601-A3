<meta name="summary" content="HOLD ON BEFORE BUYING THIS"></head><body><p>I had every intention of buying this great movie on DVD and canceled my Amazon order for it when:<br />a) I learned it has no extras whatsoever.<br />b) I learned that the previews on this DVD include a trailer for a 2008 upcoming, loaded, special edition.<br />The importance of extras for me vary depending of the nature of each film but I believe a DVD edition of Zodiac cries for plenty of information on the actual case. Knowing for a fact such an edition is coming out next year makes it a no-brainer for me to wait a little longer.</p></body></html>

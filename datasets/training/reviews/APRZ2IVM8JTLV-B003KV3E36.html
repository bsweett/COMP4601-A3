In Thailand, a group of missionaries asks expatriot<br />American John Rambo to take them up river into the country so that they<br />might render aid to their beleagered coreligionists. Reluctantly the<br />ex-Green Beret--still haunted by his past---agrees and completes his<br />task.<br /><br />However back in Thailand once more and some time later, Rambo is<br />approached by the group's Reverend to guide a group of mercenaries back<br />into Burma so that they may attempt to rescue the missing missionaries<br />who are being held captive by a brutal army and extermination group led<br />by a sadistic homosexual commander.<br /><br />However this time Rambo will not just stand by while others do the<br />fighting and dying. This time he will draw upon his old skills and make<br />a choice between "Live for nothing or die for something."<br /><br />First off it must be held against the film that the language, graphic<br />sexual content and gore is the most excessive that has yet been filmed<br />in my experience. This is not necessarily Stallone's fault but the<br />result of Spielberg and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN which seems have compelled<br />every filmmaker to tragically follow suit. It is a pity that Stallone<br />could not have resisted the trend since....as always...this type of<br />excess is numbing and severely mutes the film's emotional effectiveness<br />and important message. Stallone also apes that chaotic style of filming<br />combat that Spielberg used which filmmakers will learn to regret since<br />it renders battle scenes well nigh incomprehensible as well as making<br />it impossible to keep track of who lives and who dies. Again muting any<br />emotional resonence the battle scenes might have. The use of CGI does<br />not help either. One was unaware that high caliber shells---when<br />striking human bodies--turn people into cartoons as a prelude to<br />killing them. One did not know that..upon being stabbed or<br />shot...cartoon blood gushes from wounds. And this is really supposed to<br />be an improvement over the much maligned John Wayne war movie?? This is<br />really supposed to be "realism?"<br /><br />The above still holding firm, this is still quite a good<br />tight...running at a brisk 85 min...well directed war/action film that<br />has a strong theme, emotional power and genuine courage....the later<br />sorely lacking in our modern "I never met a genocidal mass murderer I<br />did not like unless they invaded Communist Russia in 1941" Hollywood.<br />While this is not a film for actors--the endless obscenities make any<br />true acting impossible---the handling of the Rambo character is nicely<br />handled and the resolution of his long odessey(unless Stallone goes<br />ahead with a possible fifth film) is moving. The plight of the Burmese<br />Christians is ghastly and heartbreaking. Stallone to be commended for<br />his dramatizing this terrible crime especially in a culture that would<br />probably prefer to cheer the Burmese killers on and, in any other film,<br />probably would have villified their Christian victims thus<br />indicating--like with their beloved Muslim Barbarians and their<br />outrages....that they probably "deserve it". Besides making a biting<br />comment about the utterly uselessness of smarmy Liberal platitudes<br />about peace in the face of such horrific Evil, the film also<br />rightly......and this appears to have slipped under everyone's<br />radar...makes a highly brave bit of insight by identifying the leader<br />of and driving force of the Christian exterminators as being a<br />homosexual. That right there gives the film more true subversive power<br />than anything else made in the last ten years...if even that.<br /><br />Due to the above flaws stated in paragraph 4, I tend to rate the film<br />below FIRST BLOOD and RAMBO 3 while being miles above the second film.<br />However this film has been banned in Burma becoming a much treasured<br />bootleg within the country much like samisdat was in the old Soviet<br />Union. The film is greatly appreciated by the Burmese Christians and<br />has been a morale booster for their forces fighting to survive. They<br />reportedly have adopted dialogue from the film as rallying cries.<br />Stallone has stated the proceeds from a "director's cut" will go to the<br />victimized people of Burma.<br /><br />So this much maligned film and its much maligned main character is much<br />more than merely a good film but rather is a force for good. Meanwhile<br />so-called "serious" Hollywood films have chosen not only to be bad<br />films but vessels of Evil and accomplices of genocide.<br /><br />What does that say about John Rambo and his film series? What does that<br />say about those who hysterically have attacked and maligned the same<br />for over 20 years??<br /><br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

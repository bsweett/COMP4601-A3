<meta name="summary" content="Oliver Stone is just out for your money, not the truth"></head><body><p>Oliver Stone is a movie maker, his bottom line isn't to tell us the truth , its to make as much money as he can. September 11th, being so close to all of our hearts and souls, and it being so soon after the fact, Is a hard story to tell especially in regards to the survivors and victims. Stone did not choose to tell this story, in all its heroism and individual sacrifice, in the light of truth. Instead he decided to bend and twist these men's rescue and the rescuers stories to his "bottom line" agenda. In the movie NYPD officer Scott Strauss is the man who crawls through hell to get to John and Will, in real life it was Chuck Sereika. Chuck had absolutely NO training in search and rescue and extrication, He was a paramedic who thought for sure he was crawling to his own death. In interviews with Chuck after viewing the movie said "the facts are so distorted that he didn't recognize what he was seeing as what he lived through" A journalist who was at ground zero and did first hand interviews of both the rescuers and Will and John at the hospital asked the filmmakers if they wanted his input, and was declined. Oliver Stone chose to focus on the men trapped, flashbacks, family grief instead of on the true life harrowing story of the rescuers and their unbelievable acts.<br /><br />Stone missed many real facts that should have been put into the movie, and he added some that weren't necessary<br /><br />1) Karnes, the man who dons his marine garb and sneaks onto ground zero, did not spout religious phrases to passerby's. He refused to be any part of the film.<br /><br />2) The Other marine who shows up to help Karnes was a black guy, not a white guy<br /><br />3) They completely left out a firefighter named Tommy Asher, officer Richard Doeler, and John Busching former detective now paramedic in new york. ALL of those men were VITAL to the rescue effort!! Doeler literally DUG out John with his bare hands, with no oxygen tank. It was Doerler, along with two FDNY firefighters, who finally pulled McLaughlin to safety after three hours of digging. In the movie, a team made up solely of firemen extricates McLaughlin. In real life, Doerler came in to relieve many other rescue workers who had been digging for about five hours and working sometimes in 20-minute shifts as the conditions were too difficult to withstand any longer amount of time. Doerler fashioned scoops out of metal scraps, as his usual hand shovel wouldn't fit at first. But none of these dramatic details come through in the movie. Doerler, like Strauss and Sereika before him, had to straddle the trapped officer's body in order to fit in the narrow space, balancing himself on his right arm and reaching out with his left to pull out the mashed concrete and twisted metal bits--a task made more difficult by the fact that he is right-handed. he says that the filmmakers never called him once to hear his story firsthand. Doerler said he hoped his character would be included, not for his own credit but so that the world would know what the Nassau County Emergency Service Unit did that day<br /><br />4) The wife of Dominick Pezzulo, the NYPD officer who died along side John and Will is outraged at the filmmakers saying "my thing is, this man died for you, how could you do this to this family?"  Obviously scarred enough by his death, but also scarred again by the onscreen death as well, and not in a true light.<br /><br />Most people will watch this movie and take it as the truth, for how could someone make a movie about Sept 11 and leave out crucial, and important details, especially to tell a tale of "heroism and perseverance"?. Clearly it's because the filmmakers didn't care about the people who were really involved, they were out to fill their pockets. Don't buy this movie, don't watch it. Instead I would recommend, if you are curious about the truth of that day, to watch "9/11 The filmmakers commemorative addition" which is footage shot on that very day of the events unfolding and the heroism of the firefighters and NYPD involved</p></body></html>

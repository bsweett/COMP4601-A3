Ennui saved me a terrible waste of money.<p>El Mariachi (Antonio Banderas) is recruited by CIA agent Sands (Johnny Depp) to foil the coup being plotted by drug cartel boss Barillo (Willem Dafoe) and corrupt General Marquez (Gerardo Vigil) against the Mexican El Presidente (Pedro Armendariz, Jr.). <p>Perhaps 5% of the dialogue is in Spanish, the rest English. If the subtitles on my copy of the DVD were &quot;turned on&quot;, English text translated the former and, most annoyingly, English text accompanied the latter. Well, duh!<p>The assassination of a Mexican President would seem to have all the dramatic story potential as a murder of the president of Iceland or Chad - perhaps less. It's no surprise, therefore, that this element of the storyline takes a distant back seat to the real conflict of the story, which is between El Mariachi and Marquez, who, at some point in the past, killed the former's wife (Salma Hayek) and daughter. El Mariachi is a tormented man out to get even.<p>This film is endlessly and casually violent, and the final body count must lie somewhere between the twentieth century battles of Verdun and Stalingrad.<p>The only compensation for sitting through this mess is the occasional appearance of the gorgeous Selma Hayek, and the quirky persona given the Sands character by Depp. Among other things, Sands orders carnitas wherever he goes. At one point, after eating a version of the dish so much superior to all others he's tasted to date, he casually kills the chef so, as he puts it, &quot;balance is restored&quot;. <p>To be fair, ONCE UPON A TIME IN MEXICO is a sequel to EL MARIACHI  (1992) and DESPERADO (1995). Perhaps I would better understand this last in the series if were to see the first two. Frankly, I'd rather stick hot needles in my eyes.</p></body></html>

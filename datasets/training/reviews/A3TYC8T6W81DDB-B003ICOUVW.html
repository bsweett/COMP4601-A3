Frankenstein, Dracula, and even The Invisible Man all seemed to be in a league of their own while The Wolfman didn't seem to fit in the same demographic that those films did. Once this film went into production, the cast was announced, and pictures leaked from the set, I was extremely excited. This remake had everything going for it to be everything the original film was and then some. So that's the mindset I had going into the film and luckily it didn't disappoint. The homages to the original film are definitely there, especially during Lawrence's first transformation sequence and attack on the men hunting him. Not only that, but the film is practically overflowing with blood and gore. With films relating to vampires or werewolves, they need to be scary and intimidating. We need to know what these monsters are capable of. The carnage and bloodshed is glorious in this film. In fact, as a horror fan, it gave me chills. The film's setting in 1891 or thereabouts helped establish the mood and look of the film and was certainly used to its advantage since it's hard to imagine the film having as much of an impact in a different setting. But above all else, this movie should be seen in the theater for the sound. Hearing this type of film in surround sound is one of the reasons I keep going back to theater. There was a scene with water dripping that sounded like it was dripping right behind me and hearing that howl shake the floor and vibrate your seat is a joy. If you plan on seeing this movie, see it in a theater you know has spectacular sound. It is well worth it.<br /><br />There isn't much regarding flaws for the film. As a massive horror fan, this film really delivered in all aspects. During the trailers, it seemed like everyone involved was just reading off of cue cards or something. While watching the film, the performances seem to build. The two actors that stood out the most were the two main ones; Benicio Del Toro and Anthony Hopkins. Watching the film in context, the way they talk is uncomfortable since they haven't seen each other for so long and their reactions and interactions get more intense as the film advances. Del Toro's performance shines during his return visit to the asylum he was at as a child and Anthony Hopkins is truly magnificent in the second half. I found it odd that Hopkins was saying everything twice in the trailers for the film ("Terrible things, Lawrence. You've done terrible things," "Be strong, son. Be strong," etc). and he does do that quite a bit throughout the film, but his character gets a lot more interesting later on. It didn't bother me in the long run. Regarding the look of The Wolfman, nothing really presents itself that there were any changes regarding its design. He looks incredible and the mix of practical make-up effects and CGI result in one of the better werewolf designs in recent years. There are a few scenes during the transformation sequences that are noticeably CGI, but they're few and far between and are pulled off in excellent fashion for the most part.<br /><br />The Wolfman is easily the most satisfying horror film I've had the pleasure of seeing in quite some time. It is a must-see for horror fans as it's one of the few remakes that is better than the original film. The transformation scenes are spectacular, the carnage that's left is devastating and pure bliss to watch for fans of bloody violence, and the film's sound is truly what makes it worth seeing in theaters since it's done so well. The Wolfman comes highly recommended and is one of the best films to come out in the first few months of 2010.</p></body></html>

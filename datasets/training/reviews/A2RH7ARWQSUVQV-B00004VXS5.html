<meta name="summary" content="Great title for a great western"></head><body><p>Sergio Leone once said that he knew more about the old west than any American.  I'm not sure he was right, but he might have been right about Hollywood westerns.  The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is so good that it's title has become a part of the English language lexicon.  The movie is, in it's own way, a comedy but there are moments of stark realism and pathos.  The movie is not particularly logical or consistent but more than makes up for it with gritty characters and austere symbollism.<br /><br />I hate it when people summarize films and books.  Why should a reviewer want to give the story away to people who haven't seen it?  I will hit some high points, however.  The movie starts with a very dangerous scam.  Eli Wallach--Tuco, The Ugly--is wanted for a long list of crimes.  Eastwood turns him in and collects the reward money.  Tuco is convicted to hang.  Just as the door door is fixing to drop, Eastwood from some distance away, shoots the rope in two. Both Eastwood and Wallach ride off to rip-off another town.<br /><br />The Civil War is raging in New Mexico and Blondy finds a wagon loaded with dead Confederate soldiers and houseflies.  One man, dying, mentions Confederate gold buried...somewhere.  Tuco and Blondy, dressed as Confederate troopers, are captured by Yankees.  When in the prison camp they encounter Lee Van Cleef, the very, very Bad.  While soldiers sing sweetly outside, Van Cleef and his henchmen beat our boys for information about the gold.<br /><br />There is escape and treachery.  Eastwood drags Wallach through the desert heat on the end of a rope.  He releases him and Tuco, in a wonderful scene, barges in to a gun store, looking for the right weapon.  Not satisfied with any, he starts taking them apart and putting parts together again.  Satisfied with his new weapon, he terrorizes the shop keeper and steals the revolver.<br /><br />In another scene Wallach encounters his Catholic Priest brother who curses him for being an outlaw.  Wallach smacks him down and disgustedly tells him that after his brother went to the seminary, the family starved.  Banditry was the way he fed the family.<br /><br />In another scene, the comical Wallach is taking a bath in a Civil War battle under fire from Yankee field guns.  A man who hates Wallach for some previous wrong, sneaks in to shoot him.  Wallach shoots him, instead, because, as it turns out, Wallach always bathes with his revolver on his waist.<br /><br />Another fabulous scene involves a battle.  After the fighting is over and the soldiers have left, Eastwood finds a dying Southern soldier.  Without a word being spoken, they exchange a cigarette back and forth until the soldier dies...one small act of humanity.<br /><br />The last scene is truly amazing...even spectacular.  The Good, the Bad and the Ugly face off in a three way duel in a cemetary.  Nobody knows who to shoot at first.  The camera pans up and you can see that the cemetary is an ampitheatre with the dead as the silent spectators.  Dead people viewing an act of death.  Wow.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite author of novels--"Skull Rack" and "Hummingbird God"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico</p></body></html>

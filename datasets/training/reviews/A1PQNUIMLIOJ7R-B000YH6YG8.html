I rented it having heard nothing about it, but since I've seen it, I've told everybody about it. Edward Norton delivered an increadible performance as a repentant skinhead. This was truly an amazing movie. It is Norton's best role, which says a lot because he's always great (Fight Club, Rounders, The Score, 25th Hour). This is certainly not a movie that everybody can handle. Before you view, understand that it has an extreme R rating, which is for strong brutal violence (including a graphic rape), pervasive extreme language, and sexuality (including some brief nudity). This is not exactly your feel good movie either, so be prepared. Don't watch this with your elementary age kids. American History X is an extremely hard core movie that reflects hard core life styles. It is unforgettable and will have a powerful impact on you.</p></body></html>

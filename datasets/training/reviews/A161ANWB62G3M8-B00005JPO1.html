This film has such a lot of enjoyment to it that I really did find myself feeling like I was 8 years old again. Terrific stuff. The supporting cast are great, especially Ray Winstone. It's a shame he wasn't in it more.<br /><br />Overall I hugely enjoyed this. I knocked one star off because it does get a bit lost in the middle, but otherwise a fantastic action movie with the feelgood factor too.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1906669023">Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys</a></p></body></html>

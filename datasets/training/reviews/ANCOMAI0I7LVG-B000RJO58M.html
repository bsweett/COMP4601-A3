<meta name="summary" content="This fuzz is really hot!"></head><body><p>I will admit that at times I go a little overboard when reviewing these `spoof' comedies.  I walk away from the movie thinking one thing and then, in the middle of writing my review, I change my mind.  The fact remains that these movies need time to settle.  The comedy in these films may not seem blatant and `laugh out loud' funny on the outset, but remembering the scenes can be more rewarding then actually seeing them.<br /><br />Case in point; `Monty Python and the Holy Grail' is one of my favorite comedies.  When I first saw the film I hated it.  It wasn't until a conversation I had a few YEARS later with some friends that I realized just how funny that movie really is.  Another film that strikes me as funnier when `thinking' about it is `Scary Movie 2'.  The difference there is that, when watching the film a second and third time, it becomes apparent that the film should only be thought about, never seen.<br /><br />So, it's safe to say then that, when reflecting on these films and writing my reviews my initial reaction can, at times, get thwarted by my newfound appreciation for what I had previously witnessed.  This has caused my views to get clouded at times (thus resulting in 5-star reviews for films like `Slither', that, upon further reflection should have remained the B-Grade movie I had initially intended it to be), not always for the better.<br /><br />I loved this movie from the start, in through the middle, and in the end as well.  Upon further reflection I still love it, and yet I see its faults and am forcing myself to keep with my initial grade (B+) and fight the urge to give it an A.<br /><br />Ha, now that I've said all of that (sorry), I can get to my review.<br /><br />`Hot Fuzz' pairs Simon Pegg and Nick Frost up with their `Shaun of the Dead' director Edgar Wright.  This time Pegg is playing Nicholas Angel, an overzealous police officer who has made it a habit of making everyone around him look bad, so much so that he is promoted only to find himself relocated to the country where the crime rate is low and the villagers are, well, interesting.  Angel is furious but he quickly adapts and starts enforcing the law, to the dismay of those around him (especially the lazy police force).  His partner, Danny Butterman, dreams of living out an action movie, and once citizens start dieing, he finally gets his chance.<br /><br />`Hot Fuzz' is obvious, but it is supposed to be.  You kind of know who to suspect the minute you see him, but it's okay because you expect that.  The film moves along a little slowly in parts, but it makes up for that with clever (albeit stagy) dialog and performances (Pegg slips into David Caruso mode effortlessly).  The film is kind of cut like a slick horror film, or an upstaged episode of CSI, with quick editing and glossy visuals.  The gore is very present, but always in a comical and `airy' kind of way.  It doesn't feel gory because it is there for you to laugh at.  The ending is the films best feature and greatest detractor.  It layers it on thick (the action scenes are gloriously shot and surprisingly charismatic and funny) and that is a good thing and, eventually, a bad thing (it doesn't know when to quit).<br /><br />Despite that twist upon a twist upon a twist upon a twist, it still comes together very nicely in the end and certainly warrants our attention.<br /><br />I was one who strongly disliked `Shaun of the Dead' upon my initial viewing, found it slightly humorous upon reflection only to watch it again and conclude that, while it has its moments (that record tossing scene is just glorious) it remains overrated in my opinion.  `Hot Fuzz' blows that one out of the water, and quite frankly, if it had toned down the end a tad (even in its longevity it does maintain its comedic timing though...that swan!) I would have given it an A, without any hesitation.<br /><br />I don't want to seem overzealous here, so I'm restraining myself (my inner movie-lover is aching to give this an extra star now!).  See what I mean?  I started this review determined to go the way of a B+ and I've already talked myself into an A-.  No, no I must stick to my guns here.<br /><br />B+, x's 1000!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Lumet: Still The Master Filmmaker"></head><body><p>When I heard aging director Sidney Lumet was attached to BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD, I was dubious about its success. Not because Lumet has any stains on his record! Quite the contrary. With films like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010YSD7W">12 Angry Men</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006JU7T">Serpico</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NTPG7K">Fail Safe</a> to his astounding credit, he is well-known as a vintage director of classic melodramas. But his age (83 at the time this film was made) could've been a factor; old-style filmmaker does old-style job again. But any fears were quickly whisked away once I started watching his latest film.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, when Hollywood heard the name "Lumet" and that it was involved with a new movie, several bigshots jumped at the chance to be in it. And this was a very good thing. Philip Seymour Hoffman (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E33VWW">Capote</a>) heads this all-star melodrama (yes, it's still a melodrama and that's a VERY good thing) alongside Ethan Hawke (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EWBKK8">Lord of War</a>) and the incredibly sexy Marisa Tomei (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000QFCD86">Wild Hogs</a>). Forming a kind of triumvirate of misfits, Lumet takes the audience on a wild ride both in terms of how the timing of the film is laid out (jumping from date to date and perspective to perspective) and what each of them is up to. Hoffman turns in another excellent performance as Andy, a man with financial and drug issues and married to the beautiful Gina (Tomei). Gina is lost amidst her husband's distant actions and shut-in existence and finds solace with his brother Hank (Hawke).<br /><br />Hank is also having financial woes and isn't the brightest bulb in the package. And when his brother Andy (Hoffman) comes to him with a plan to hold up a jewelry store in order to solve their problems, Andy is hesitantly for it ...until he learns Andy's plan is to rob their own parents' store. Store owner and parents Charles (Albert Finney, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I5XOWI">Tim Burton's Corpse Bride</a>) and Nanette (Rosemary Harris, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UR9T7I">Spider-Man 3</a>) are completely oblivious to their son's plan and when Hank hires a man to help him rob the store, things go horribly wrong.<br /><br />It is to Lumet's credit that he spearheads the issues each character deals with and does so without extending it/them into boredom; an area that has plagued many past melodramas. Sexy, dangerous, and frighteningly realistic, Lumet delivers a film that picks up tension as the characters spiral out of control. Even Charles (Finney) isn't immune to the pressures of these horrific events, finding himself making a decision no father should ever be in the position of making.<br /><br />Again, it is to Lumet's credit that he's not afraid to move with the times and show us he knows what works for audiences. The opening sex sequence will certainly grab many viewers. Lumet also isn't afraid to use new technology in his filming; he's all digital. This speaks to his understanding of how well he sees filmmaking as an art, which includes how light falls onto film versus into the digital 1s and 0s.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Classic"></head><body><p>Like so many other Disney films based off fairy tales, all the dark, nasty parts have been cut out and lots of music has been put in. The original versions sometimes had as many as a dozen fairies to give Sleeping Beauty various blessings, but in this movie, the number has been pared down to three (not including the bad fairy)<br /><br />The bad fairy has been given a considerably more prominent role in this film, and Sleeping Beauty (Aurora) is not raised as a princess - the fairies foster her in a cabin hidden away in the woods and name her Briar Rose. Considerable liberties have been taken with this tale, such as causing the Prince to fight Maleficient, but this movie is actually a pretty good retelling of the Sleeping Beauty tale.</p></body></html>

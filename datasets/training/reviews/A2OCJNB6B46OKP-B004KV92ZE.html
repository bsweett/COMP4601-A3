<meta name="summary" content="An utter dissapointment."></head><body><p>The cgi film genre has really gone above and beyond anything we have come to expect. Since the release of the classic Toy Story in 1995, the computer animated film has been taken up by all the major studios and even introduces digital 3-D technology. Still, with this breakthrough art film taboo at this point I feel that now business is taking over and it's up to the cooporate people to just get the movie to the big screen so people can spend their money just because it looks cool.<br /><br />That brings me to Kung Fu Panda. Now, I unfortunatly missed this movie in its theatrical release, but I had heard good things about the film and that it was even up for the Oscar. I saw it and wondered what the academy was smoking and why they weren't willing to share. Did I seriously miss something with this movie? First of all the movie was not funny. I don't about the movie going masses, but Jack Black needed to try and learn how to diversify is acting. I really thought that after his role in King Kong he would have gone on to do some great work. Instead we him doing the exact same thing in every movie he makes. My other problem was the cast. You would have guessed that Jackie Chan was in this movie? Maybe if they would have given him or any of the other supporting members of the Furious Five more than 2 lines you would have?<br /><br />Personally I don't even want to keep talking about this disgrace of a film. Besides the maginificent work on putting together the fight scenes this movie was pretty horrible. I once thought that Disney had finally gotten knocked off the pedistil as the number one maker of animated films. Nowadays I realize I may be wrong. You have to see who wants to bring a good film to the masses and who just wants to make the big bucks. It really is a numbers game when it comes down to it.<br />First Pixar Toy Story 1995 First DreamWorks Antz 1997<br />Pixar: 10 soon to be 11 with Toy Story 3  Dreamworks: 15 Soon to be 17 with How To Train Your Dragon and Oobermind<br />How many won oscars? so far it's Disney 4 and Dreamworks 2<br /><br />I guess Disney still has the magic and for the record Up was amazing!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Common Situation Portrayed Brilliantly"></head><body><p>Maria Alvarez (Catalina Sandino Moreno) is a seventeen year old living a poor farming life in Columbia with her mother, sister and her niece whose father has deserted them.  After losing her only job in her community, Maria finds herself involved with smuggling heroin into the USA.  This would give her enough money to start a new life in what is referred to as `the magical land' (El Norte).  Desperate, she finds herself in a situation completely unlike she expected and meets tragedy and betrayals everywhere she goes.  However, there are those kind enough to understand her and support her - if she manages to live.  Moreno was up for Best Actress for this role, which is uncommon for a non-UK or American actress.</p></body></html>

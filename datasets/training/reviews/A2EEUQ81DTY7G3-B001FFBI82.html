<meta name="summary" content=""Are we ever going to kill anyone?""></head><body><p>There's some good things about Jarhead - the performances are excellent, the often, crude, absurdist, and back humor really hits its mark, and the recreation of the 1992 Persian Gulf War is generally well done, but the film is ultimately hampered by a lack of a good plot. Under director Sam Mendes' awkward direction, this film about the absurdity of the first Gulf War, which is linked to the absurdity of all wars, struggles hard to maintain momentum and find its feet.<br /><br />Jarhead is Anthony Swofford's 2003 Gulf War battlefield memoir. The central premise of the book was the ultimate irony of going off to war and kill people, but just waiting and waiting. Rather than actually seeing battle, the marines endured the sheer boredom of waiting for a war to happen, of the drinking, joking, lusting, swearing and quarreling of a bunch of adrenaline-charged and testosterones fuelled twenty year-olds, sitting around in the blazing, surreal Arabian desert, wondering, "Are we ever going to kill anyone?" It all becomes rather frustrating, lonely and tedious, and foreshadows a powder keg of pent-up anger.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal plays Swofford or "Swoff," a third-generation enlistee who joins the Marines just in time to go to Saudi Arabia for the war. Signing up for the marines rather than going to college proves to be a big mistake, as Swoff soon discovers that he hates the army. During the harrowing rigors and hazing of basic training, Staff Sgt. Sykes (Foxx), a lifer who loves his job, selects Swoff for his elite unit of scout/snipers.<br /><br />Sykes pairs Swoff with Troy (Peter Sarsgaard), giving him a partner whose calm exterior belies the turmoil inside. Other soldiers in their unit include the intellectually challenged loudmouth Fowler (Evan Jones), extremely shy Fergus (Brian Geraghty), married man Cortez (Jacob Vargas), and stolid Cuban-American Escobar (Laz Alonso).<br /><br />Jarhead's early scenes are probably the best, when the soldiers are beginning their training and the military brass is getting them all psyched up - in one scene they shout and cheer to the aerial battle scene in Apocalypse Now. Their company commander is Lieutenant Colonel Kazinski (Chris Cooper), who pumps up his men with war fever and never allows for disagreement as he toys with the men using military psychology 101 to keep them gung-ho about their mission.<br /><br />The movie's largest section takes place in the vast nothingness of the desert, where everyone digs in and waits ... and waits and waits. With no enemy to fight, conflicts inevitably turn inward. The Marines have a solution for everything, Swoff remarks, but none for losing your mind. Squabbles break out and scorpion fights are staged. Guys rag on each other about what wives or girlfriends are doing back home. The banter and jokes revolve almost entirely around toilet humor, sex and violence, which is funny for a while, but rapidly becomes rather tedious.<br /><br />Without a lack of definable plot, it's a war movie without much going on, Jarhead comes across as being a bunch of scenes strung together, including the Kuwaiti oil-fields going up in blaze, a drunken Christmas party ending in an accidental fireworks explosion, and a scene where Swoff is made to clean out the filthy latrines. However, viewers who like seeing butch, muscled young men sunning themselves in the desert will richly rewarded, and Gyllenhaal looks just fantastic.<br /><br />But the characters, particularly the secondary characters, are ultimately too dumbly portrayed to imbue that much sympathy or leave us with a lasting impression. There's the usual stock war figures, consisting of a wise guy jokester from a small-town in Massachusetts, a loud-mouth Texan, a reserved sensitive white guy from Kansas, and a pudgy Latino homebody proud of his pregnant wife back home in California.<br /><br />Mendes and cinematographer Roger Deakins create haunting images of the marine's ordeal: The burning oil fields and the black rain falling at night, which reduces the color scheme to yellow, red and black; of Marines digging into the oily sand to make absurd foxholes; of Swoff wandering in a daze through a landscape of charred vehicles and incinerated Iraqis, his boots making white prints in blackened sand. All this images are beautiful yet also unsettling.<br /><br />The movie also does a good job of capturing the irreverent machismo, and Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard are effective in portraying the smart and savvy nature of their characters who grow increasingly disillusioned with their mission. In fact, Jarhead is almost a quasi-war film, to the extent that it admires it's Marine heroes even as it notes their frustration and anger, and it never shies away from showing them in a less than positive light.<br /><br />But the film, probably to its ultimate detriment, never takes a political position. This neutral viewpoint causes the movie to observe intense events in a dispassionate remove without really tackling the greater issues that war raises, that of the futility and brutality of modern warfare and the often misguided politics behind it.

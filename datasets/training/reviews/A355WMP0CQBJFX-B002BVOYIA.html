<meta name="summary" content="ONE MANS COURAGE TO DO WHAT SO FEW WOULD EVEN THINK ABOUT!"></head><body><p>hotel rwanda is an excellent movie. extremely moving and heartfelt that you can't help but wish there was something you could do. it delivers the truth that is happening or has happened in so many countries. this film is touching and truly inspirational on so many levels. it just makes it all the more sorrowful when you know it's based on true events. the brutallity of some people, that stands against this one mans courage to stand up and help. he is determined to help his people to survive at all cost. even if it means his life. he feels he must fight, even if he fights alone. all the while you see the fear in his eyes, but you also see the courage in his heart. he gives his people refuge in his hotel. he does all he can to protect them. he gives everything, although he is in constant danger. in the meantime outside of this hotel all around there's people dying, getting tortured, and chaos has broken loose. when no one in the world can help them, or care to what can he do? he wants to do more, but how does one man stand against an army. in the end he is a hero in the eyes of those he helped and is an example to all others, and just when he thinks he can do no more, help has come. excellent directing, and if this film doesn't move you in one way or another, damn then i don't know what's up with you. i got to hand it to don cheadle, this man is wonderful. this is a one in a lifetime performance. i don't think anybody could have done it the way he did. great actor, and you know he gave it all and then some in this film. he portrays brilliantly what one man did to save over 1,200 refugees from the hands of mad men. it's a powerful film.</p></body></html>

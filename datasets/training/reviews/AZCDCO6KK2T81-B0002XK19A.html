I was a bit underwhelmed with the original film although it was pleasing enough and I was happy to see my all-time favorite comic-book icon swing onto the silver screen, but I did predict that this series of films could improve with time as the core elements were all there, but I never ever thought they would produce such a fantastic film as this one.  The original cast, which was great, returns bringing more depth to their roles.  Tobey was great as Peter Parker, but his voice-over Spider-Man had a lot to be desired.  His sense of comic-timing, a Spidey trademark, was way off and unconvincing as was the CGI Spider-Man.  Those issues have been put to rest.<br /><br />Maguire IS Parker/Spider-Man!  The CGI effects are enormously improved upon and now very believable.  The show-stopping scene of the runaway train is nothing less than jaw-dropping.  To beef up the believability factor we get numerous scenes of a real stuntman and Spidey without his mask on which allows us to feel more for Maguire as a character and hero.<br /><br />The problems with the over-top-acting of Willem Defoe as the Green Goblin villain is brushed aside with this new villain that is marvelously played by Alfred Molina.  We honestly like this guy when we meet him and feel great empathy for his disasterous turn.  The effects involving his character are perhaps the best ever created for a comic-book transfer to film villain.  You just can't believe your eyes.  It's astounding.<br /><br />I do not know how they will top this one, but this is arguably the very best comic-book to film ever made.  It does everything a film should do and then some.  It does everything a sequel is supposed to which is continue the storyline in a believable manner.  Again, it does that and then some.  It leaves the audience wanting more and that is the highest compliment any audience or reviewer can say about a film.  BRAVO!!!!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Jack is Back"></head><body><p>It has been four years since the last we saw Captain Jack Sparrow in the bloated third film of the Pirates of the Caribbean series, but this time he is back in a stand alone story that has little to do with the previous three. This may be the shortest of the four movies as well (around 2 hours and 15 minutes) and it's never boring, but for some reason it still seems too long. I must admit that I liked Dead Man's Chest and At World's End, but the first one, as with most movie series, will always be the best. On Stranger Tides might even be slightly better than the last two sequels. At least it's not as confusing as At World's End, but I can pretty much say that if you didn't like the last two you'll probably feel the same about this one.<br /><br />Johnny Depp it seems will keep playing this character until the day he dies. I read that he wants to do at least two more PotC movies. Yes he has created one of the most memorable characters in movie history, but too much of a good thing can turn annoying real quick. I think he fares quite well this time around, more so than the last two, even though Jack Sparrow gets more and more goofy with each outing. Geoffrey Rush is back as Captain Barbossa and has his moments. Ian McShane has the look suited for Blackbeard, the most feared pirate of all time, but they should have made him much taller as was the real man. Depp even towered over him in some scenes, making him less intimidating. He also didn't do as much with this villainous role as I was hoping for. Those who have seen McShane on Deadwood know what I mean. Since Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley are gone, Pen&eacute;lope Cruz tries to fill the void as the daughter of Blackbeard. She looks good of course, but there wasn't much chemistry between her and Depp. The addition of mermaids was my favorite part, and these are like no mermaids I've ever heard of. Their beauty lures you in before dragging you underwater to be drowned and devoured.<br /><br />I read that the budget was half of the last film (around 150 instead of 300 million), but I really didn't notice. The CGI and sets looked up to par. Of course you also will get more than enough of that loud Han Zimmer score that runs through the whole series.<br /><br />Overall, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides is not a great movie and it might leave you with the impression that you have already seen this before, but as a mindless piece of summer entertainment it gets the job done.<br /><br />Oh, the IMAX 3-D looked really clear, but I'm not sure it was worth double the price.<br /><br />3 and 1/2 out of 5 stars</p></body></html>

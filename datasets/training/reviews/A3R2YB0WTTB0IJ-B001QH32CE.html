<meta name="summary" content="ADRIENNE SHELLY, OPUS 3"></head><body><p>**** 2007. Written and directed by Adrienne Shelly. This motion picture is a very good surprise, it's a slice of Americana that transports us into the lives of three waitresses of the Deep South. The director had undoubtedly a style of her own which gave to this dramatic comedy a special flavour rather unusual in the actual American cinema, so tasteless in my opinion. If the first scenes of WAITRESS may seem a little TV show oriented with an immobile camera and too many witty dialogues per minute, the rest of the film is a little jewel of sensibility confined in a multicoloured box worthy of multiple viewings. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

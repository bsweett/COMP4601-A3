This was like the Angelina Jolie version of The Bourne Idenity or whatever those movies are with Matt Damon.  They all bite the big one.  Most of the movie is just Angelina Jolie being chased by evil FBI guys, and so on and so on.  Alot of shooting and car crashes tailor made for brainded action movie fans who like to just zone out in front of a tv screen.  I wish they would just stop making movies like this.  Angelina Jolie should stick to intelligent dramas, she's better than this and all of the other Tomb Raider crap she got involved in.  I could'nt even sit through the whole movie, didn't care what happened because you just don't care about the character.</p></body></html>

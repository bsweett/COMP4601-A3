<meta name="summary" content="Very cool special effects and Charlize becomes an action hero!"></head><body><p>In the future, a lethal disease kills off 99% of the population and what's left of humanity is gathered in the cloistered city of Bregna. Hundreds of years later, Bregna has become a "perfect" and sanitized Eden, run by an authoritarian regime. But, of course, every paradise has its infestation and the same is true here. There's something not quite right with the citizens of Bregna; they are plagued with troubling dreams and are gripped with a feeling of unsettledness. Enter Aeon Flux, the most capable and lethal agent of the resistance group aiming to overthrow the government. She is sent to assassinate Trevor Goodchild, the current leader of the ruling establishment. But the seemingly straightforward mission quickly goes awry and Aeon finds herself immersed in an insidious conspiracy centuries old, of which scope threatens to undermine the very bedrock of Bregna's ideal society.<br /><br />So we're back in that old "been here, done that" standby of the Utopian world with a fatal flaw. And yet, Aeon Flux is better than I thought it would be. Admittedly, I didn't know what to expect going into this one. I'd seen (and liked, in a bemused sort of way) some of the weird MTV Aeon Flux cartoons of the 1990s, and those shows struck me at the time as being non-linear, bizarre and angular in animation. For one thing, every single episode I saw had our sexy assassin dying. So I was curious to see how the live action film would be interpreted. I gotta admit, I was sold with the very cool opening scene of Aeon's eyelashes Venus-flytrapping a fly.<br /><br />The overall impression I have of the movie is one of aesthetic sleekness. It's visually arresting, with a semi arty-farty approach that recalls to mind The Fifth Element, in terms of its overall design and look. I like the way the filmmakers integrated nature with the futuristic sci-fi elements (Aeon and Sithandra evading literal "blades" of grass and tree pods shooting out deadly slivers; Big Brother implementing water in the use of surveillance technology). The special effects are astounding and original looking and alone make the film worth screening. I both liked and got creeped out by Sithandra's four handlike appendages.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the plot is nothing new. And being nothing new, it  commits the unforgivable sin of being dull. The action scenes are fairly trite but are beautifully executed, thanks in large part to the beauty, grace and athleticism of the lead star. She certainly is a credit to the recent slew of butt-kicking females coming out in our media (Buffy, Elektra, Lara Croft, Resident Evil's Alice). Charlize worked out for about 4 months and performs 95% of her own stunts, and that contributes to the film's integral credibility. It's also heartening to witness three females handling the brunt of the action here. The acting...is okay. No one sucks, no one stands out. Because the nature of her internalized character calls for it, Charlize has to come from a minimalist standpoint, acting-wise; her expressive, luminous eyes instead do a lot of emoting. I believe Charlize also is pretty close with her tonal mimicry of Denise Poirier, the voice of the animated Aeon Flux. However, the great Frances Mcdormand is totally wasted in her role as the rebel handler.<br /><br />Special features are comprised of:  2 commentaries (one by the screenwriters, the other by Charlize Theron and producer Gale Anne Hurd); "Creating A World: Aeon Flux", the obligatory "making of" documentary, which includes input from creator Peter Chung; a segment on the various locations wherein the film was shot; a stunts documentary breaking down the workout regimen of Charlize and the two other action-oriented actresses; "Craft of the Set Photographer", which details the still photographer's job and tools of the trade; and the movie trailer.<br /><br />It's too bad the box office result doesn't seem to warrant a sequel. Aeon Flux has flaws, but Charlize Theron proves to me that she has that certain heroine quality and certainly the physicality to have Aeon Flux become a franchise of Paramount Pictures. Great Godfrey, the sight of Charlize Theron in her futuristic scanties is almost worth the price of the dvd alone.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I wept for the death of Nazi Germany..."></head><body><p>World War II movies have usually entertained me, though a vast majority of them have been relegated to the same dull "Saving Private Ryan"/"Band of Brothers" pro-America, screw everyone else storytelling.  That's not to say Band of Brothers or Saving Private Ryan is bad, simply that they break no new ground.  They are entertaining, but they are hardly one of a kind.<br /><br />Then came Clint Eastwood's "Letters from Iwo Jima" which captivated me with its utterly human portrayal of virtually every level of Japanese military command on Iwo Jima.<br /><br />And so I came to Downfall, which has been lauded for its well-rounded portrayal of Hitler, and criticized for its supposed "heroicizing" of some higher-ranking Nazis responsible for horrible war crimes.<br /><br />Thankfully the film is German, so it is naturally in German, and well-known Hollywood stars aren't around to be a distraction from the content.<br /><br />Bruno Ganz is almost frightening in how he can make Hitler a real person, from a brief prelude in 1942 which clearly portrays the man who held an entire nation captivated, to the broken shell barely hanging on to his ambitions, his struggles, and his sanity two and a half years later.  His genial nature to the main character, Traudl Junge is almost frightening when you remember this is the same man who nearly destroyed Europe, was responsible for the killing of tens of millions of Russian soldiers, millions of western Europeans, and ten million civilians with the "Final Solution".  And so easily he can turn on the fits of rage and shouting that could melt even the most spartan of military officers.<br /><br />I do agree that some of the high-ranking Nazis are treated almost like heroes, but I think this speaks volumes about the kinds of people who would perpetrate such crimes as the Holocaust; normal people, with virtue and vice, sticking to an ideal and blinding themselves to a reality, or otherwise accepting the reality as furthering the ideal.<br /><br />Every character is portrayed as more than a grotesque caricature of evil, hatred, and rage, given personality, even down to the stone cold zealot Goebbels, whose unwavering devotion to Nazi Germany is no detraction from his humanity, as he mourns the loss of his children, genuinely believing the future to be not worth living in without the Third Reich.<br /><br />There is no propaganda to this film:  Hitler is human, yes, but that does not make him right or his actions forgiveable.  Bruno Ganz as Hitler is warm, gentle, and witty, and he is stubborn, heartless, and deranged.  The Soviets are the greatest threat Germany faces in these last days of the war---as they were for most of the ground battles in the war.<br /><br />Somewhat foolishly enough, my only complaint with the film is that every explosion is accompanied by the exact same sound effect of twisting metal.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An exceptional biopic"></head><body><p>"Ray" is a remarkable biopic of legendary songwriter/musician Ray Charles. It avoids many of the pitfalls that bedevil most movies of this type. After all, it's difficult to synthesize the life of a very famous person into a movie that doesn't run so long an audience can't sit through it. ["Ray" runs 2 ? hours, but doesn't seem long at all.] You have to resort to cliches to keep the dramatic movement going. "Ray" does have its cliches and its pop psychology, but these are overwhelmed by a focus on Charles' music and by Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Ray, which is so good that there simply is not another choice for this year's Best Actor Oscar.<br /><br />Nominated for 6 Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Actor and Best Director.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Well-crafted, well-acted but emotionally distant"></head><body><p>THE ILLUSIONIST is a very interesting movie that nonetheless falls short.  It fails to achieve the emotional impact it is clearly striving for.  It has an intellectual impact, it pleases because it shows a time and situation unfamiliar to us and it entertains with its originality and execution.  But at no time are we caught up in a sweep of emotions.  We observe from a distance.<br /><br />It tells the story of Eisenheim The Illusionist (Edward Norton), an unparalled "magician" who returns to his childhood home of Vienna after traveling the world in search of the greatest illusions ever seen.  He causes an immediate stir with his brilliance, and attracts the attention of the young heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne (Rufus Sewell) and his young bride-to-be (Jessica Biehl), who also happens to be the childhood sweetheart of Eisenheim.<br /><br />They rekindle their relationship.  Meanwhile, Eisenheim has captured the interest of young royal heir, and not in a good way.  The prince imagines that he is smarter than Eisenheim, and when he can't immediately expose the method behind the illusions, he becomes resentful, and sends the police (led by Paul Giamatti) on a mission to destroy Eisenheim.<br /><br />It's a good story, and it takes some nice turns, particularly when Eisenheim and his true love conspire to get away from the prince...and the seemingly tragic results of that effort.  The movie beautifully captures old Vienna.  It is remarkably intelligent and doesn't insult its audience.  And it has some really great magic tricks.  Naturally, we know the tricks are created through special effects...however, what is GREAT is that the film allows us to sort of put ourselves in the audience of late 19th century Vienna...and to feel just a little how stunning his illusions would have been.  We spend the whole movie wondering if he is an illusionist or if he really can do the tricks.<br /><br />Edward Norton is very intense in his role, and with his VanDyke beard, he looks terrific.  A true leading-man kind of part for him.  He's riveting.  Giamatti and Sewell have terrible facial hair, but otherwise do nice work.  Giamatti does struggle a bit making his "Viennese" accent believable, though.  Biehl, while hardly asked to leap through huge dramatic hoops, does just fine amongst these greater actors...and  I suppose if you're one of those who voted her "Sexiest Woman Alive," you'll probably enjoy her a great deal.<br /><br />But somehow, the movie remains distant emotionally in telling the romance.  We just don't CARE all that much.  Yes, we want the good guys to win and the bad guys to get their comeuppance.  But not in a deep way.  No tears are shed.  The movie spends so much time EXAMINING things...the illusions, the schemes, the political machinations...that it forgets to just let emotion run free a bit.  It's very controlled and has a leisurely pace.<br /><br />I admire it a great deal, and recommend it.  It's PG-13, but except for one brief "bedroom" scene with Norton and Biehl that isn't terribly explicit, I think it could almost have been PG.  Don't expect to be blown away, but do enjoy being taken to another time and another mindset for 2 hours.</p></body></html>

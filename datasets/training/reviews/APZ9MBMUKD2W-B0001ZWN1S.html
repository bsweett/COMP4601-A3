<meta name="summary" content="Another Classic Film to ponder on"></head><body><p>I hate saying this but I learned more about life from this film than I did while attending High School at the same time. Maybe because I am not the sharpest knife in the drawer but every time I see this film I find something new in it. A first rate film and I just wish that Hollywood could make more films of this high a quality.</p></body></html>

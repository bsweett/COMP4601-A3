<meta name="summary" content="One of Clint's very best."></head><body><p>As far back as I can remmember going to a Clint Eastwood film has always in itself represented a warranty for watching something decent at the very least. After UNFORGIVEN came out, there were plenty of just OK films like SPACE COWBOYS, ABSOLUTE POWER, TRUE CRIME and the like but recent years have come with an Eastwood streak of fantastic hits which is just amazing considering the guy will be 80 next year. My personal favorite will always be the said UNFORGIVEN but GRAN TORINO is definetely in my top 5 favorite Eastwoods. The sight of the boy driving the car by the lake at the very end should have you smiling from ear to ear. Just great.</p></body></html>

Based on the novel DAS PERFUM by Patrick S&uuml;skind and prepared for the screen by Andrew Birkin, Bernd Eichinger, and director Tom Tykwer, this is a story more about the senses than about people.  The main character is not the sort of man with whom we can identify, but the progress of this crazed youth into the olfactory madness of serial killing for the sake of creating perfumes does provide an opportunity to study life in the 18th century in a way seldom available for viewers.  It is clumsy in spots, protracted in length, and a bit tedious in the telling, but visually this is a movie that is a feast (?) for the eyes.<br /><br />Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Wishaw) is born in poverty and while he is thought to be stillborn, he survives and is found to have an extraordinary sense of smell. His youth is spent in work houses and slavery until one famous Italian perfumer Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), living in Paris, discovers Grenouille's gifts and takes him on as an apprentice.  The lad learns the technique of vaporizing and boiling essences but when he asks Baldini how to capture the smell of 'anything at all' (particularly the scent of women), Baldini sends him off to study the technique of 'enfleurage', a manner of embedding flowers in fat until their essences are absorbed yield a pure form in the distillation of the melted fat.  Grenouille begins to capture women to coat them in fat to obtain their scent and in doing so he begins his cycle of murders of the victims.  When he encounters the lass Laura (Rachel Hurd-Wood) who would steal his attention, her father Richis (Alan Rickman) finally puts and ending to the macabre tale of Perfume.<br /><br />In many ways, though the cast performs well, the star of the production is the cinematography by Frank Griebe and the accompanying musical score by Reinhold Heil, Johnny Klimek, and (yes) Tom Tykwer. At 147 minutes the movie is too long for the story, but the setting and moods created are well worth watching. Grady Harp, August 07</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Cute and funny, but a bit long for my taste"></head><body><p>When Los Angeles workaholic Amanda breaks up with her boyfriend, she needs a place where she can go and take her mind off things. At the same time, British newspaper journalist Iris realizes that she will never live happily ever after with the ex-boyfriend she's been pining after for three years. The two decide to swap lives, in effect, and each live in the other's home for two weeks.<br /><br />In the beginning, Amanda thinks she's made a mistake and books herself a flight back to La La Land. Then enters Iris's charming older brother, Graham, who sweeps Amanda off her feet in what she expects to be a one-night stand but turns out to be much more. Iris, on the other hand, has a great time in Los Angeles from the very beginning and makes friends with an elderly screenwriter who is Amanda's neighbor. Their friendship forms the foundation that allows her to forget about her ex and move on with her life.<br /><br />The Holiday is, as other reviewers have noted, two romantic comedies in one. Cameron Diaz is endearingly neurotic as the workaholic Amanda who is so busy running a successful business she doesn't have time to have sex with her boyfriend. When she meets Graham and finally allows herself to let her guard down, it was a perfect romantic comedy moment complete with the complicated plot twist (which I won't give away, but let's just say Graham's been keeping secrets). Similarly, Iris lets herself be walked on by the object of her affection for so long that she forgets that she does deserve to be loved back by someone who will appreciate her. The relationship that she forms with Amanda's neighbor gives her the gumption to finally stand up for herself and stop being a doormat. This movie was a cute and funny romantic comedy, and my only complaint is that--at over 2 hours--it was a bit longer than I expected or was necessary. Other than that, it was enjoyable and entertaining.<br /><br />Also, I originally thought The Holiday must have been based on the Jane Green novel Swapping Lives, which has a similar home exchange between a Brit and an American, but since the two were released within six months of each other, I guess that's not the case. Still, if you enjoy this film, you might want to check out Swapping Lives for a different perspective on the same story.</p></body></html>

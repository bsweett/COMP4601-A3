<meta name="summary" content="Maybe it is a Christian allegory?"></head><body><p>This film, based on the graphic novels, seems to be draped in darkness with the exception of the blue glowing Dr. Manhattan. This use of darkness reminded me of the film Blade Runner but also reminded me of the paintings of the Renaissance where all characters are presented in darkness illuminated sometimes by strong light with the exception of Christ, often glowing as if illuminated from inside his body. Thus there are some loosely associated similarities to Christ entering a dark world which does not understand him and Dr. Manhattan's transformation and evolution and eventual distancing himself from the human condition and perspective as his vistas grow and he seems to take on the impersonal cognitions of a distant God.<br /><br />The use of an alternative past as the setting for the film allowed for political commentary, particularly about political opportunism and short-sightedness, as evidenced in the character of Richard Nixon.<br /><br />Yet in many ways it is also a film noir with all the dark puzzle pieces of a private detective film from the 1940's. There were some very strong performances including Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the Comedian, a superhero with strong sociopathic and violent tendencies. However Jackie Earle Haley steals the entire film with his outstanding performance as Rorschach. This bundle of pent up and everlasting rage is often more than the other heroes can endure. Haley's wild scenes in prison are worth the price of the film and his dialogue is darkly wicked. Billy Crudup plays Dr. Manhattan, a character that links Christ and physics in one character struggling to be both human and God. The character of Jesus has this same duality since Jesus is both God and human. Thus Dr. Manhattan struggles to remain attached to the human world and its emotional attachments while at the same time he is mastering the mysteries of the physical universe. Christ feels compassion for his fellow humans and it is this quality that Dr. Manhattan is losing or nearly loses in the film. There is much speculation around why Dr. Manhattan is naked with blue genitals. But this links him to Adam, for he is a first and unique being.  Malin Akerman is spectacular as Silk Spectre II, the force that eventually convinces Dr. Manhattan that the human race is worthy of redemption. Patrick Wilson plays Nite Owl II as the more human, humble competitor for Silk Spectre II's affection. He plays this part very well, rising to heroics gradually as his testosterone levels rise.  Matthew Goode never convinces us that Ozymandias was ever a team player with the other heroes so his later antics don't seem much like betrayal. The storyline is pure entertainment and draws from a thousand references and plots. It is predictable and yet the film is fully entertaining.</p></body></html>

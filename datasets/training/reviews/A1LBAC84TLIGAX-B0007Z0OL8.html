<meta name="summary" content="A FUNNY POLITICAL-BASHING, UNABASHEDLY OFFENSIVE FILM  8.5 OUT OF 10"></head><body><p>Team America: World Police is a rather funny and well-made film that is not afraid to bash liberal politics, celebrities, and third-world countries like North Korea. I really enjoyed the fact this film is not afraid of flipping the bird to people like Michael Moore and other celebrities like Alec Baldwin and rubs their faces in the fact that they are total jackasses and need to shut the hell up.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: When a member of Team America is killed by terrorists, they find another man; a Broadway actor named Gary; and use him to dress up and act like a terrorist in order to foil plans of a massive worldwide terrorist attack, but what they don't know is that North Korea has been supplying the weapons to terrorists and is the main country planning a worldwide terrorist attack. So they must foil these plans as well, and prevent Hollywood's most well-known hardcore liberals from getting in the way. Yes, this film does use marionettes for the characters.<br />MUSIC: There is decent music, and not to mention the fact the filmmakers actually wrote some of the songs played in the movie and they aren't afraid to use the F-word in them either.<br />GORE FACTOR: Yes, there is gore in this movie. Limb-ripping, getting shot to death, exploding, splatting on the ground, being eaten by giant cats, and more.<br />ENTERTAINMENT: This film is quite funny, rather dirty and inappropriate in so many ways, and very gory. What damages the quality of this film is a slow and stupid beginning and the puppet love-making scene made me want to gouge my eyes out because of how disturbing it was (They basically did almost every sexual act known to man). This is definitely not for kids, oh no it's not at all for kids.<br />OVERALL: This film is definitely worth a buy for a good laugh and it will keep the laughs coming. This film is not afraid to be offensive or disturbing so if you easily get offended or grossed out you've been warned.<br />THE GOOD: Unafraid of bashing liberal politics, it's funny, it's gory, and it's very entertaining.<br />THE BAD: Slow beginning, disturbing puppet love-making scene.</p></body></html>

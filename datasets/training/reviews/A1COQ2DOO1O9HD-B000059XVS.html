It was an experience I'll never forget.  There are movies half its length that seem twice as long.  <p>Part of the joy of watching this film is the knowledge that almost everything you see on the screen was REALLY THERE.  The film's most exciting sequence, the takng of Akaba, was staged full-scale on a riverbed in Spain.  Now it would be done digitally - if anyone would foot the bill.  <p>Big, "spectacular" films are still made.  But in an age where opening weekends mean everything, no studio would gamble such extravagance on the story of such a complex, conflicted man, who by some accounts was a sadomasochist and homosexual.  The film deftly reveals these possibilities without politicizing them or judging them.  Honestly there is little historical evidence for these ideas, anyway. What is known is the Deraa incident - a terrifying sequence in the film - where Lawrence was brutally beaten and raped by a Turkish general.  That this incident occured, and that it left Lawrence shattered, there is little doubt.  The film is circumspect about the details (it was made, after all, in 1962), but clear on its results: Lawrence went from being a gentleman warrior (almost an oxymoron) to a ruthless one. <p>The great achievement of Lawrence of Arabia is that it manages to  be an intense character study as well as a spectacular action film.  Neither aspect gets short-shrift.  The man and desert are so inextricably fused that one layer of the story shades into the other perfectly.  It is a masterful piece of filmmaking.  <p>There is much talk about the picture and sound improvements in the Superbit edition.  I plan to buy it soon.  But don't ignore this two-disc set, as well.  The second disc has a wealth of extra material, including a fairly thorough "making of" documentary that features interviews with many cast and crew members who worked on the film.  If you're not interested in these extras, then the Superbit edition is probably the way to go.  If, like me, you enjoy behind-the-scenes stuff as much as the film, then you should probably buy this one.  Or perhaps both.  <p>After all, they don't make them like this, anymore!</p></body></html>

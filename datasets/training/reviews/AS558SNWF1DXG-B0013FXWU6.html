<meta name="summary" content="Didn't like it? Try it again. It really gets better."></head><body><p>I'm a huge P.T. Anderson fan and, of course, was very excited when -- years after "Punch-Drunk Love" -- he reappeared with a new movie: "There Will Be Blood," a two-and-a-half hour epic about oil prospectors at the turn of the century. I saw it the day it opened.<br /><br />On my first viewing, though, I didn't know what I thought. I respected the film. I thought Day-Lewis was amazing. I knew it was a daring, challenging effort. But I didn't know if I actually liked it, especially that crazy ending. The whole thing seemed to contain very little of the P.T.A. that I liked so much.<br /><br />I was so perplexed I went back and saw it again. And that's when it really affected me. That's when certain sequences -- an oil fire, a speech about schools and bread, even just the sight of a drifting cloud shading a desert camp, a dab of oil on a baby's forehead or the shapes of oil wells sprung up on the horizon -- became profoundly, inescapably moving.<br /><br />This is a movie so rich and deliberate and limestone-dense that knowing what will happen in the end actually sharpens its impact. It's in a second viewing that one can fully appreciate the characterization Daniel Day-Lewis brings to the role of Plainview.<br /><br />But other elements are just as strong or very nearly -- young Dillon Freasier, who had not acted before, is astonishingly potent as Plainview's mostly silent son; Kevin J. O'Connor uncannily mirrors and converses Day-Lewis' characterization; Ciaran Hinds does a lot with very little as Fletcher Hamilton, Plainview's tough but watchful and subtly tender right-hand-man. And much was written about the abrasive edges of Jonny Greenwood's string-heavy score, but it's impossible to listen to a piece like, for example, "Prospector Arrives" and not be moved; he's created a rarity of a score -- music that's absolutely inseparable from the film, and almost seems to have been created simultaneously with the direction.<br /><br />The movie's biggest talent, however, is Anderson. Many directors have lately tried to channel Terrence Malick (for example "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" which is a beautiful, haunting movie -- but really not much more than a gorgeous ode to "Days of Heaven"). Anderson does evoke Malick, but he incorporates enough of his own style and voice that the film transcends imitation and becomes something else entirely -- possibly something greater even than Malick's own films.<br /><br />---<br /><br />The double-disk DVD is taking flack for not offering a wealth of material. But I think it's a fine, handsomely presented package. I think the extra disk offers just enough background on the film without giving away everything.<br /><br />A slideshow and through a 1923 documentary, "The Story of Petroleum," offers many of the sources and much of the inspiration behind much of the movie, beyond what was drawn from Upton Sinclair's novel, "Oil!"<br /><br />A fine deleted scene, "Fishing," shows us that -- contrary to what Plainview tells a crowd early in the film -- he occasionally DOES lose his tools down the hole and has to spend weeks fishing for them. The scene is great to see -- and sheds a lot of light on the relationship between Daniel and Eli's father -- but it would've interrupted the flow of the final narrative, and I'm glad it wasn't in the final cut.<br /><br />I'm also glad there's no alternate audio track. Yes, P.T.A. gives some of the most interesting commentary around, but I honestly appreciate that he's leaving hidden some of the mysteries hidden behind this strange and wonderful and beautiful film. It's not for everyone, I realize, but I think it's the best movie of this year and last year and possibly the year before that. It just took me a second viewing to figure that out.</p></body></html>

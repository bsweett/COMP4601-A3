<meta name="summary" content="Great premise but almost masterpiece level"></head><body><p>Before filming began, Steven Spielberg created a "think tank" of scientists, physicists etc to basically brainstorm what would the future be like, from transportation to home movies to advertising. It's an eerily real picture, as if someone went into the future and came back and told everyone what he saw. So we have Spielberg's first action blockbuster since the Lost World and it's not in the same category as E.T or Jaws but it's still an entertaining romp.<br /><br />Less than 50 years from now, the Precrime Unit uses the psychic abilities of 3 clairvoyants to determine when someone gets murder so it's up to the police to stop it from happening. But this creates a debate: is someone a murderer if they haven't done it yet? John Anderton believes in its system until he becomes the murderer of someone he's never met. Instead of just getting arrested, he decides to do what they others don't get to do: figure out why he's going to kill him meanwhile being hunted by Precrime's other policemen.<br /><br />It's a future that seems quite possible. Instead of advertisements on TV, electronic scanners scan your eyes than proceed to advertise their products/services and actually address you. Getting on a train gets you scanned. They even have small Spyders which can also scan rather than policemen doing it themselves.<br /><br />Transportation systems have electronic cars magnetized(said in the bonus features) and they can travel up and down buildings. Instead of men building cars, it does it all by itself. These and many more are featured in the film and helped along by Spielberg's think tank.<br /><br />Now for the film itself. It's merely a good movie. It's not awesome like Jaws, or great like Close Encounters, it's merely good. Close Encounters had a 2 and a half hour pacing but never felt it, here it almost feels it(same length). Also while Jaws freaked you out and scared you and Jurassic Park gripped you, this just merely entertains you. It's like it doesn't get you pumped about the action scenes, it's like "ooh an action scene" but you don't get anything afterward.<br /><br />Tom Cruise can be a good actor if he had the right character. Ever see Magnolia? He's actually surprising in that. Sometimes actors think the best way to act is just to have a big serious face the entire film so it looks like you're deep in thought and troubled. Robert De Niro and Al Pacino can just do one facial expression and they say more than a big overracted speech. Tom Cruise kind of pulls it off, getting better as the film continues. The rest do their job but they merely play static characters, providing a certain type of attitude, so you have the estranged and little bitter wife, the "I'm gonna get you" government agent and the father-ly runner of Pre-Crime.<br /><br />If you're thinking of another Spielberg masterpiece think again. But it's close enough and even a near masterpiece is more better watching than the recent fare plaguing movie theatres(I'm looking at you The Pacifier, Monster-in-Law and Shark Boy and Lava Girl)</p></body></html>

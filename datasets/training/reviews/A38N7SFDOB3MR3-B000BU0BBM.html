<meta name="summary" content="Highly Entertaining. 72 out of 100."></head><body><p>I didn't know what to expect with this movie. I had never heard of it when it hit theatres, and found it on Pay Per View. I read the reviews here, and gave it a shot.<br /><br />A good movie, and very immersive and entertaining. There was minimal gore, and even less "bad acting" as some have said in their reviews. It is fantasy - immersive fantasy - and accomplishes what it should: to take us away to another world where we can get lost.<br /><br />I got lost, and you will too! I would love a sequel.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 72<br /><br />37 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.<br />6 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?<br />9 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?<br />8 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace. Is the movie forgettable, or something you will talk about and remember for weeks? Years?<br />8 (out of 10). Must see. Is this movie worth seeing/renting?<br />4 (out of 10). Must buy. Is this movie a must buy/purchase?</p></body></html>

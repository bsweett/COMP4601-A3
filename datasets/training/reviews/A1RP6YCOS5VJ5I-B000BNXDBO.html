I agree, if you love movies like American Pie, then you will like this movie. The jokes are funny and the story is not boring. It is also interesting to see how many cameos are in this film, because there are a some. The movie slows down for a little while but picks back up again and finishes with the possibility of a sequel and I think it deserves one. "Harold and Kumar go to Amsterdam" would make a great movie!</p></body></html>

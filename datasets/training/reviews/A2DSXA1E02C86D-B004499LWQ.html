<meta name="summary" content="Julia speaks as never before"></head><body><p>From the trailers and the presence of Julia Roberts in the cast, I went into CLOSER expecting a light romantic comedy. (My preconceptions haven't been so shattered since I saw Bambi's mother get shot by hunters at the Saturday kiddie matinee!)<br /><br />CLOSER opens as Alice (Natalie Portman), a New York stripper on a visit to London, is grazed by a car after she's looked left instead of right stepping off the curb. She's taken to the hospital by a stranger, Dan (Jude Law), a writer wannabe with whom she starts a live-in relationship. Then, Dan sits for a formal portrait by photographer Anna (Julia Roberts), on whom he unsuccessfully hits. Subsequently, Larry (Clive Owen), a dermatologist, meets Anna, whom he marries, then divorces after discovering that she's had recent sex with the once-spurned Dan. On the rebound and needing physical comfort, Larry seeks out Alice, now shucking clothes at a London strip club after having left Dan, and whom he'd previously met at one of Anna's photo exhibits. But Dan still pines for Alice and is emotionally devastated that she may have had sex with Larry. Is this messy, or what? (The timeline is murky; apparently all this happens over a couple of years.)<br /><br />CLOSER is a film, painful to watch, of sexual manipulation, possession, and obsession in which the four principal characters inflict emotional cruelties on each other. It's not holiday fare for an afternoon out at the movies with your aged Mum. The language is sexually graphic and, in one sequence of scenes in the London strip joint, visually raunchy. CLOSER is, however, one of the best films of 2004. Julia Roberts is perhaps the biggest surprise as she shows that she can radically transcend - even beyond ERIN BROCKOVICH (2000) - her usual cute roles; I was mightily impressed.<br /><br />It would be hard to pick this film's lead and supporting parts. All four (Portman, Law, Roberts, Owen) have about equal screen time (though I wasn't keeping track with a stopwatch). Any, or all, of them could garner an Oscar nomination.<br /><br />I had begun to doze about a quarter of the way into the film, but then woke up almost with a start as I realized that CLOSER is an exceptional adult film, without visually explicit sex or violence, that brutally shows grown-ups in dysfunctional relationships behaving at their very worst. Truly, as is indicated by a line in KINSEY:<br /><br />"Sex is a dangerous game. If you're not careful, it can cut you wide open."</p></body></html>

It didn't, but it wasn't a pleasant experience either.<br /><br />On the plus side the action scenes with the big monsters were put together very well. The rest was pretty cruddy. First was the casting. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes have worn out their welcomes with me. If I never see them in another movie it will be too soon. Liam phoned it in and Ralph was so awful he must have been really upset that he was even in the movie. The rest of the cast was OK but nothing stellar which might be due to the fact that few of them had all that much to do. In all fairness, when the band of adventurers was formed for the quest (the two brothers were a hoot) there was a sense of male bonding happening, and most of the actors did a decent job, but even this has been done much better before. Sam Worthington did a fine job and somehow his lines were better than everyone else'. As bad as this script and the dialogue was his lines were generally good. It were as though the producers had a personal writer for him.<br /><br />The directing was mostly horrendous. The camera always seemed to be in the wrong place. These types of movies have gotten so much better over the years. You'd think the director, Louis Leterrier, would have watched a few of them to get some kind of clue on how to do this. That's another curiosity. How could he direct some of the action scenes so well and most of the others so poorly. Go figure.<br /><br />The costuming was pretty horrid as well. Much of the hair styling stunk and the music was OK but forgettable.<br /><br />The story was there. It's just a shame it was so mishandled. I like these kinds of movies and went into this wanting to savor all the good parts. Problem was....there were too few of them to savor.</p></body></html>

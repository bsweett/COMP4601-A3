Provocative Story, Great Cast, & Beautiful Design."></head><body><p>Every once in a while a thoughtful horror film comes along, one that creeps the audience out and makes it ponder at the same time. "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" is one of those films, written by Paul Harris Boardman and director Scott Derrickson, who were inspired by a true story. When a young woman named Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter) dies of starvation and self-inflicted injuries at her family's Midwestern farm house, the State prosecutes her priest, Father Richard Moore (Tom Wilkinson) for negligent homicide, claiming that his encouragement to abandon medical treatment for epilepsy led to Emily's death. Emily had been suffering from frightening hallucinations, seizures, and violent behavior which she came to blame on demonic possession and believe could only be cured by exorcism. Ambitious agnostic attorney Erin Bruner (Laura Linney) defends Father Moore and the possibility that Emily's affliction may have been spiritual, while the practical, church-going prosecutor Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott) lays the blame for Emily's death squarely on religious superstition that fed her psychosis.<br /><br />"The Exorcism of Emily Rose" is part courtroom drama, part horror movie. This turns out to be a good combination, as the courtroom scenes allow Emily's story to be told in flashbacks, which paces the horror evenly throughout the film. And the horror punctuates the courtroom drama so that it never becomes plodding. The first thing that struck me about this film was the quality of the cast. Laura Linney and Campbell Scott in a horror flick? This obviously isn't schlock. Great character actors bring much-needed credibility to this spooky tale of the maybe-supernatural. Campbell Scott's role as the prosecutor, a religious man himself, brings stronger conflict to the courtroom than if it were simply a secular prosecution. Jennifer Carpenter's physicality as Emily Rose is remarkable. She's a sweet, earnest woman who does some very freaky stuff, terrifying herself and everyone else. Carpenter's incredible physical performance allowed the use of visual effects only as subtle enhancement, grounding supernatural events in realism.<br /><br />The second thing that struck me about "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" is how good the film looks. Director Scott Derrickson has an impressively cinematic vision. He took great care with framing, colors, and production design. The courtroom scenes are especially captivating, thanks to production designer David Brisbin, who found a middle ground between realistically dreary institutional courtrooms and Frank Lloyd Wright. "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" claims to be "based on a true story", but "inspired by" is probably more accurate. The real case took place in the 1970s in Germany. A devoutly religious woman named Anneliese Michel, who had been epileptic and psychotic for 6 years, died in 1976 of self-imposed starvation after a series of exorcisms. Two clergymen and her parents were brought to trial on charges of negligent homicide. In the real case, it was clearer than in the movie that Miss Michel's problems were medical. But it was also clear that she had exhausted the offerings of the medical community, which was unable to successfully treat her after years of trying.<br /><br />The DVD (Sony Pictures 2005): Bonus features include 1 deleted scene with optional director's commentary, 3 featurettes, and an audio commentary. In "Genesis of the Story" (19 min), writer/producer Paul Harris Boardman and writer/director Scott Derrickson talk about the film's themes and researching cases of demonic possession. The film's cast also discuss their characters. We hear how Derrickson found his actors in "Casting the Movie" (12 min), and Jennifer Carpenter talks about her role.  "Visual Design" (18 min) includes discussion of Scott Derrickson's visual philosophy for the film, inspired Francis Bacon paintings. He and production designer David Brisbin talk a lot about he color palette. Costume designer Tish Monaghan talks about trying not to give the impression of a particular era. And visual effects supervisor Michael Shelton, of "Captive Audience", talks about his team's contributions. There is a good audio commentary by writer/director Scott Derrickson. He discusses the origins of the project and his intentions with the film, providing a scene-by-scene commentary on the actors, characters, visual design, pacing, sets, filming, and some technical details. Subtitles for the film are available in English only.</p></body></html>

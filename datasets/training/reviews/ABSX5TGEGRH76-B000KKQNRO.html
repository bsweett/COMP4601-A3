<meta name="summary" content="Despite What Critics Say, This Is A Good Movie"></head><body><p>When will people learn to stop judging movies based off of the merits of the books?  Probably never, seeing as how I am guilty of that as well.  While I enjoy the Harry Potter films, I can't seem to get over how much better the books are.  Books and film are two very different media, and it is pretty much impossible to completely reconicle the two (though Sin City came very close).  I will admit that the book The DaVinci Code is much "better" than the film, but that doesn't make the film bad.<br /><br />Before I go into the explanation of the book/film debate, as well as the controversy of the film, I will first go over the story for the few of you who don't know it yet.  Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) is a renowned Harvard professor who is an expert in symbology, or the study of the meaning of ancient symbols.  While lecturing in Paris, France, he is contacted by the French police who tell him that they require his help in a murder case.  Earlier that night, Jaques Sauniere (Jean-Pierre Marielle), the curator of the Louvre, was shot and killed.  However, with his last breaths, he used a pen with ultraviolet-sensitive ink to write a message as well as cutting symbols into his own flesh and arranging his body to resemble Leonardo DaVinci's famous sketch, The Vitruvian Man.  The police are baffled by the fact that, instead of trying to identify his killer, Sauniere instead chose to leave cryptic clues.  Soon, Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tatou), a cryptologist for the French police, arrives to aid the investigation.  However, she is able to secretly pass off a message to Langdon in which she states that he is in danger; Captain Bezu Fache (Jean Reno) erased part of the message that supposedly implicates Langdon in the murder, and Fache only brought Langdon in to force a confession.  Langdon and Neveu decide that, in order to decipher Sauniere's puzzles, they must escape, but in the process, they realize that the clues lead them to different paintings by DaVinci, eventually leading them to a special key bearing the mark of the Priory of Scion.<br /><br />Langdon explained to Sophie that the Priory of Scion is an ancient secret society dating back to the days of Christ, and that they are charged with keeping an ancient secret so powerful, that if it were to be released, it would shake the very foundations of the Catholic church.  Priory members have been hunted for centuries by church, hoping to prevent such a secret from coming out.  Numerous prominent historical figures are rumored to have been members, including Victor Hugo, Sir Issac Newton, and Leonardo DaVinci.  While Langdon was never sure he believed that the Priory ever actually existed, a monk named Silas (Paul Bettany), who is receiving orders from a Bishop (Alfred Molina), who in turn is getting his orders from a man known only as the teacher, ruthlessly hunts for Langdon and Neveu.  He is responsible for Sauniere's death, and he will stop at nothing to silence the Priory once and for all.  Rounding out the cast is Sir Ian McKellan, playing Sir Leigh Teabing, a biblical scholar.  Teabing is an old friend of Langdon, and he helps further explain the secret and its true power.<br /><br />Any problems the film may have definitely do not have to do with the actors.  Everyone involved gives great performances, especially McKellan, who seems to be able to do no wrong in his roles.  The "problems" have to do with the translation from book to film.  The story is, for all intents and purposes, a treasure hunt, with some very difficult clues linking the destinations.  In the book, the author isn't restricted by time limits, so Dan Brown was able to allow a lot more time for Langon, Sophie, and Teabing to decipher their clues, while giving Fache time to pursue his leads on finding the trio.  Ron Howard only has about 2 hours, and with so much story and expostion to get through, the characters have to figure things out a lot quicker in order to advance the plot.  We merely have to suspend our disbelief a little more than we would in the book.<br /><br />Speaking of suspending our disbelief, I cannot reiterate enough that Dan Brown wrote a fictional book.  He wrote a story to entertain, not to teach or challenge the church.  With that in mind, I can't believe how much controversy there has been surrounding this film.  Many religious groups have called for this film to be banned, stating that its subject matter is blasphemous.  Some countries succeeded in getting it banned, while many people in the United States are actively protesting.  Just look at some of the reviews on this site.  It is obvious that the writers haven't seen the film, but they disagree with the secret (which, unfortunately, a few of them reveal, so if you don't want to be spoiled, be very careful when picking which reviews to read).  It's too bad that so many people are so close-minded and cannot understand what fiction means.  The DaVinci Code is a great story that everyone should definitely read, and most people should see (I can understand how some fans of the book would be put off by the film).  Ron Howard and company have given us a good movie with a cool plot, solid acting, and good effects.  Don't let a little controversy stand in your way of seeing it.</p></body></html>

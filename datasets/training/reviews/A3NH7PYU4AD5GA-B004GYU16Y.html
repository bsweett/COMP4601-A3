<meta name="summary" content="A film like a drawing by Escher"></head><body><p>This is probably as amusing as the so-called summer genre of action movies can get. Don't take it serious, don't worry too much about plausibility, just go with the flow.<br />The film has two legs: crazy, stunt-driven, violent, spectacular action, and a classical spy - counter spy puzzle. Who is working for whom, who are the good guys and who the bad ones, is there a difference anyway?<br />Jolie's character (?) Evelyn Salt is a CIA agent, married to a German arachnologist in Washington. She gets exposed by a former Soviet spy master as a Soviet sleeper agent, planted in the 1980s together with dozens of others, to cause havoc in the US at a yet to be determined time. The time has come. Assassinations of the visiting Russian President and then of the American President are on the agenda. Plus a nuclear attack on some targets.<br />For most of the time we wonder if she is a Soviet spy or an American spy posing as a Soviet spy or a Soviet spy posing as an American spy posing as a Soviet spy. You know, the Escher thing.<br />A sequel is guaranteed.</p></body></html>

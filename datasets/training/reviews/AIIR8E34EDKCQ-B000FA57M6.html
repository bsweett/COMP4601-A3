Did they need money?" because it is based on a game and has its own world, it does not follow what we on Earth would call a story taken from life.<br /><br />The special effects were rough at times and made me think that whoever did Pac Man was still doing his work on this movie, but since it's based on a game I took it with a grain of salt. The creatures were pretty wild and I like "alien chase on starship" whether under water, in outer space or on a Moon type of a movie.<br /><br />I liked how certain characters, without spoiling anything, changed sides and there were a few nice plot twists. Karl Urban and surprisingly the dude known as The Rock were pretty good in this one.<br /><br />Fun movie to see, but it's not deep soulful or Oscar nominee material.<br /><br />Pretty much eye candy, but overall better than I expected.</p></body></html>

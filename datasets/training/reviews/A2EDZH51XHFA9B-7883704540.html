At the same time, the similarly placed giant of the Japanese animation industry, Studio Ghibli, started gaining American converts; a few years later, critics saw Princess Mononoke and realized that there might be something to this guy Hayao Miyazaki's directorial skills after all. Then came 2001, and each studio released its (to date) magnum opus; Pixar treated us to Monsters, Inc., while Ghibli unleashed Spirited Away, both of which are widely considered to be among the thousand or so finest movies ever made. There, their paths diverged. Ghibli, never known for being a factory, has released only a single movie since (Howl's Moving Castle), with its second in the period since slated for release in 2008. Pixar, on the other hand, who had previously followed a somewhat similar release schedule, started plowing them out like gangbusters. Pixar have released, on average, one full-length movie per year since 2003. Some studios can do that and not sacrifice the quality inherent in their previous stock. Pixar, as it turns out, was not one of them. Whereas Toy Story (and its sequel) and Monsters, Inc. are fantastic movies for all ages of viewer, the post-2001 material has become increasingly kid-centric. Not that this is necessarily a bad thing if your target audience is kids. But, as the makers of any number of kids'-movie flops in recent years (with 2006 a nadir) will lament, what does it matter if your target audience (a) can't drive and (b) has parents who cower in terror at the thought of seeing whatever it kids the kids are so all-fired excited about? The lowest point, for Pixar, came with last year's Cars; the only person I know who actually likes the movie was three years old when it came out.<br /><br />I don't know whether someone at Pixar realized that Ghibli was pulling away with amazing speed in the animation wars, or whether cooler heads finally prevailed, but Ratatouille is a long-awaited return to form--a Pixar movie that will enchant both kids and adults alike. Well, except for those who don't like rats. The story focuses on Remy (The King of Queens' Patton Oswalt), a highly intelligent rat who's obsessed with cooking. Through a series of misadventures, Remy hooks up with Linguini (Pixar regular Lou Romano), a janitor at the restaurant of the chef Remy idolizes, and Remy finds his opportunity to become a world-class chef with Linguini acting as his hands. A simple plot, as in the best Pixar movies, rapidly spirals out of control into something Corinthian in its complexity, while the visuals provide a feast of amusing details that show there's a brilliant mind at work behind the controls. Bird, responsible for the decent-but-nothing-special The Incredibles a few years ago, finally lives up to the promise he showed with The Iron Giant. This is the kind of stuff Pixar is capable of putting out when it brings it's a game, and it's wonderful to see Pixar bringing it's a game again. ****</p></body></html>

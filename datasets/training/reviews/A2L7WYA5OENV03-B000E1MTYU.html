How on earth can you have a Terminator film without Cameron or at least 2 of the 3 key actors?  Well, they did just that and it was actually enjoyable.  This film is loaded with humor, not the self-contained kind from T2 but rather a sort of homage to the previous two films.  Sure this is the easy way to do it in a trilogy, but it also has a familiar warmth about it.  And the homages don't just stop at the humor but encompass many aspects of the film.  This does give you the sense that they're running out of ideas, but I highly doubt that.  Most of this was on purpose, though it certainly does cost the film somewhat in the depth department to take this route.<p>There are two aspects of this film that truly make it shine.  First, Claire Danes is an absolutely wonderful actress.  If she hadn't been cast in this role the project would have been doomed.  She brings depth and humanity to a movie that already has us trying to empathize with a robot and another actor filling in someone else's role.  Second, we get a nice take on the other films' mantra of "There's no future but what we make for ourselves."  Now, imagine John Conner is a bit of an optimist who simply will not accept the laws of temporal mechanics.  That it'd take his pragmatic wife to make the tough decision to ensure their survival at all costs is a heck of a great idea.  The lengths we learn she is (will be) willing to go through, including allowing the T-101 to lie to her, is a wonderful development on the part of the writers.  The only people who could conceivably have a problem with this is the hardcore Terminator 2 fan, who believes that mantra defines the first two films and throwing it out would simply make a mockery of the series.  But since that's not me, it becomes a plus in my book.<p>I do have some problems with this film, though.  I know the actor who played John Conner before isn't exactly considered very reliable anymore, but getting someone else is at least as bad as being stuck with the other guy.  This other actor is definitely talented, but it's an unavoidable emotional leap and, resultantly, a drawback for the audience.  It feels at times like a soap opera, a franchise that can't be shut down...kind of like ER nowadays.  The actors become interchangable, and that's a shame.<p>Next, there's a scene in an Air Force hanger that is atrocious in almost every way.  Without any sort of earlier set up, we suddenly learn that Danes' character was taught how to fly in the very trainer they're running towards.  All the writers had to do was have her reminisce about her dad teaching her how to fly at some earlier point in the film, and there were plenty of opportunities for this when John and she are just talking.  <p>Then we have the T-101's hokey melt down in that same hanger.  The concept of this occurring is perfectly fine, but it's executed in a less than satisfying manner.  Even worse, as John's heading back to the plane he explains (!!!) exactly what we just saw for us with that special oh-so-succinct insight that poorly written "informative" dialog tends to have.  Simply put, the hanger scene needed major revision and reshooting.<p>Finally, the climax of the film at the blast door doesn't feel very climatic.  When we got there and the intensity suddenly revs back up, I had to think to myself "Oh, this must be the climax."  That's never a good sign.  The film actually felt like we had a ways more to go, as the intensity had not properly been built up during the preceding scenes to justify the emotional catharsis of the climax.  This might sound a little intellectual, but it's precisely because it was not quite instinctively and emotionally satisfying during this scene that I'm forced to use the left side of my brain to discuss it.<p>Even with this said, the resolution of the film is satisfying, so all is not lost.  As you can tell I liked the film and am not holding it up to a higher standard than would be justified.  The film is entertaining.  Danes is great.  The humor and homages made me chuckle.  The chase scenes are good.  Sure a lot of the CGI has that soft Star Trek Nemesis look, but the attention to little details like the sand turning into glass from the heat of the time portal made me sit up in my seat.  And last but not least, we get to find out how Skynet was going to be developed whether the original terminator had been sent back or not.  It's not a great film, but considering how low my expectations were I'd say it was definitely worth seeing.  Maybe now they can immediately make a sequel where we see the initial coping with the holocaust and the rise of the resistance up to the climatic sending of the first terminator.  Michael Biehn could certainly be recast for his role, entering the film in the second half.  I'd pay money to see that T4.</p></body></html>

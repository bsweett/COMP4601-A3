Also, although not confirmed, expect some redone Special Effects shots much the same way some shots were redone in TMP:DE.<p>This 2-disc set will include several featurettes including: the CAPTAIN'S LOG featurette (includes new interviews with Meyer, stars William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Ricardo Montalban and writer/executive producer Harve Bennett), the DESIGNING KHAN featurette (includes interviews with Meyer, Bennett, graphic designer Lee Cole, costume designer Robert Fletcher, production designer Joe Jennings and more), The VISUAL EFFECTS OF STAR TREK II: THE WRATH OF KHAN  featurette, original interviews from 1982 with the cast and crew (including the late DeForest Kelley) and THE STAR TREK UNIVERSE - A Novel Approach by Authors Julia Ecklar and Greg Cox featurette (interviews with Trek novelists).<p>Star Trek II has been considered by Star Trek fans to be one of the best Star Trek films ever.  However, I'm impartial to Star Trek VI myself.  But that being said, Star Trek II had some very memorable scenes and plot lines.  The basic plot is a genetically enhanced superhuman from the late 20th Century has been found after exile from the original Star Trek episode "Space Seed" by the name of Khan.  He has commondeered the Federation Miranda-class starship Reliant and steals a new Federation experiment known as the Genesis Torpedo.  The Genesis Torpedo is a device that can terraform a dead planet into a living and breathing planet.  However his ultimate mission is to exact revenge against Cpt. (now Admiral) James T. Kirk for abandoning him on the planet Ceti Alpha V.  Khan pursues Kirk and the Enterprise around the system in some very exciting ship to ship combat akin to 18th Century naval warfare.  The battle ends in a climatic battle in the Mutara Nebula.  However when the battle ends, the Genesis Torpedo ignites and creates a planet out of the nebula.  Something that it wasn't supposed to be able to do.  And then we see the result of that in Star Trek III.<p>Nicholas Meyer was given the reigns of Star Trek II, and he wanted to transform the look of the Star Trek franchise.  Instead of the pajama style uniforms from TMP, he gave them Red Jackets with an open-fly type collar and Black Trousers and Boots.  This style of uniform remained with the series all the way through Star Trek The Next Generation in the episode "Cause and Effect" where the Enterprise D encounters an old Miranda class ship from Kirk's time.<p>But as for future Star Trek films in Director's Editions, Star Trek III is supposedly soon to follow.  Possibily before the end of the year, however I wouldn't hold my breath, being that it's taken almost a year to get this one out after TMP:DE.</p></body></html>

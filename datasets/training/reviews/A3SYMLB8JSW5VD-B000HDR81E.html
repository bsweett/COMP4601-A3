<meta name="summary" content="The Odd Couple"></head><body><p>I really enjoyed this film. It tells a real poignant story about what happens in a relationship when people take each other for granted. The chemistry between Vaughn and Aniston was great Vaughn was flat-out funny especially Cole Hauser who played the younger brother. It wasn't the best Aniston film but it was still enjoyable. The supporting cast was great as well.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""If it wasn't for bad luck....""></head><body><p>If anyone has viewed the respective talk shows over the past few weeks, he or she is familiar with the story of Chris Gardner, a down-on-his-luck father that overcame overwhelming odds to become an established stockbroker and successful businessman in his own right.  It is story that has been vividly brought to the screen with a dynamic and heart-wrenching performance from star Will Smith and a poignant acting debut from the actor's real-life son, Jaden.  Both father and son play so well off each other that it was indeed a stroke of genius for such a casting coup.<br /><br />Thandie Newton continues to deliver memorable turns as she assays the role of Gardner's wife Linda who abandons both husband and son for the chance of a better life in New York, miles away from their San Francisco location.<br /><br />Speaking of "the city by the bay," it continues to be one of the most appealing locations and director Gabriele Muccino takes advantage of this fact, always making sure that the audience sees notable landmarks in the background.<br /><br />In a movie of this type, where the "saccharine level" could be very high, Muccino keeps them at a minimum, only showing three scenes that start the tear ducts to do their jobs.  This is a tribute to his skills as a director.<br /><br />Andrea Guerra's score is never overpowering, always effectively subtle to coincide with the on-screen events.<br /><br />In all, "The Pursuit of Happyness" is one film that should be pursued by all moviegoers.</p></body></html>

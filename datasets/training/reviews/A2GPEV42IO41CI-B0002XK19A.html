<meta name="summary" content="Super hero, lover, Pizza Guy!"></head><body><p>Tobey Maguire stars as Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man, in this clever, thrilling, and sometimes poignant blockbuster, sure to please all ages.  Peter is something of a lost soul, living in a dump, forever in debt, habitually late to class, and losing jobs quicker than you can say, "Pizza Time!" - all the while moonlighting as New York City's greatest crime fighting hero.  He's also hopelessly in love with actress Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), but unable to tell her due to his Spider-Man responsibilities and the fact that he's the shyest and most naive young man ever.  Enter Dr. Octavious (Alfred Molina), a scientist who has discovered a new and very dangerous form of energy - which goes horribly wrong and changes him into an evil monster, complete with four super-strong metal arms.  He conspires with the late Green Goblin's son (James Franco) to kidnap Mary Jane and destroy Spider-Man!<br /><br />Tobey Maguire gives Spider-Man a very real, EveryGuy face; an average-Joe who doesn't have all the answers (except when he's wearing that red and blue suit), but does have lots of problems and insecurities.  Maguire, with his puppy dog face and endearing lisp, is the boy you'd like to take you to the prom (or adopt, depending on your age).  Kirsten Dunst is suitably wholesome and perky as his love-interest, and Alfred Molina is just right as the creepy and campy arch villain.  The special effects are first-class and the whole movie is a feast for the eyes.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Spider-Man 2.  The eye-popping scenes of Spidey sailing through Manhattan's skyscrapers are great fun; I heartily recommend Spider-Man 2 for family-friendly thrills.</p></body></html>

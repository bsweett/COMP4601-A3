I have seen small pieces of it, but never cared to watch it. I have the 2 disc set and I was amazed at the transfer and sound. This is the way musicals should be done. The songs are memorable and there is a good story with dialogue! I watched "The King and I" which I really liked and then "Oklahoma" which bored me to death! If your not a musical fan "The Sound of Music is the place to start. The story will hold your interest, the kids are charming and Julie Andrews is a very talented captivating beauty! It's a 3 hour movie, but it did move along at a fairly quick pace.</p></body></html>

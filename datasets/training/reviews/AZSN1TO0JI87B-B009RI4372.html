This is probably the most violent, most blood soaked movie I have ever witnessed in my life -- Isn't it just wonderful? 5 college students head to a secluded cabin for a weekend retreat. They discover a tape recorder of a professor talking about demons taking over his wife, which also awakens the spirits in the cabin and strange stuff starts going down. Ash, the main character's sister starts going loony and turns into a zombie. And of course, one by one, each of Ash's friends are also possessed by the Evil, until only Ash is left and must discover how to destroy the evil and make it out alive. Evil Dead is nonstop &quot;red&quot; action. You will be on the edge of your seat after the first 15 minutes of this flick. Sam Raimi's directing style is very intense and gives this movie it's beef. I suggest this movie to ANY horror fan. Parts 2 and 3 got just plain silly, but the original will always be a classic in my book.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Phenominal Acting, Horrible Ending"></head><body><p>This is the story of Maggie Fitzgerald, played masterfully by Hillary Swank, who enjoys boxing and wants a shot at the title.  What sets Maggie apart is described as her "heart" or her eagerness to win and inability to step down.<br /><br />Directed and also starring Clint Eastwood, he plays boxing coach Frankie Dunn, who at first vows to never teach Maggie (due to the fact she is a girl) but then caves upon the pressure of her persistence.<br /><br />This also has Morgan Freeman in the supporting role as Eddie Dupris who is Frankie's best friend and right-hand man in everything.  He also narrates the movie.<br /><br />These three actors have fantastic chemistry.  They worked well together and hope that many academy awards (next week) are awarded to them for what they have pulled together.  They didn't go for cheap laughs and high costing special effects and this turned out to be a fantastic movie.<br /><br />Fantastic... until the end.  The problem with the this movie is that the main character, Maggie, goes against her nature.  In the end, she turns out to be a quitter.<br /><br />Also, it is hard to believe that a movie could be made like this after what happened to Christopher Reeves and his overwhelming determination.<br /><br />So, if you love fantastic acting then you've got to check out this movie.  However, be prepared for the last third of the movie.  It made me disappointed (and I dropped two stars because of it).</p></body></html>

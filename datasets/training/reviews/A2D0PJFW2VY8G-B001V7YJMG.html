While the Twilight series still divides critics, Let The Right One In was critically acclaimed on its release with the likes of Empire Magazine hailing it as their film of the year.<br /><br />Set in Stockholm in 1982, the film focuses on 12 year old Oskar (Kare Hedebrant) who has fallen foul of a trio of bullies at school but hasn't the courage to stand up to them. Oskar finds hope in Eli (Lina Leandersson) who lives next door but only meets with Oskar at night. It is through Eli that Oskar finds the strength to stand up to the school bullies but his greatest challenge is facing his growing love for Eli and the dark secret that she is a vampire.<br /><br />Let The Right One In is a great testament to Swedish filmmaking. It boasts none of the jaw-dropping effects you would expect from Hollywood but what it lacks in visual treats it more than makes up for with the atmospheric settings of snow-covered streets, deciduous woodland and plain, unspectacular houses. This is a dark and brooding town with little colour, providing the perfect backdrop to the tender romance that develops between two lost souls.<br /><br />Though both young, the two leads are excellent. Troubled Oskar is quiet and sensitive, the perfect target for the ruthless trio of bullies who sadly do not stop at name calling but resort to physical harm as well. Eli is a tortured vampire, her blood thirst portrayed more as a sickness with no pleasure taken in the killing she has to do. Amidst the snowfall on a town outraged by gruesome murders, both children find strength and love in each other. First Oskar in facing his tormentors, Eli daring to enter Oskar's room uninvited and, finally, Oskar having to choose whether to help Eli or let her go.<br /><br />There is little to fault with Let The Right One In. I felt there could have been more detail about Eli's past but this could easily have taken too much of the focus away from Oskar. Despite some areas of obscurity the film works well in swaying from love to violence, though any bloodshed is tastefully done here.<br /><br />Let The Right One In is an excellent but different horror film conveying a romance unhindered by seemingly unassailable boundaries. The brutal bullying inflicted on Oskar hits hard but the equally brutal revenge against the bullies raised a smile for me. Sadly some film fans won't touch anything that isn't British or American but Let The Right One In is one of many examples that world cinema is alive and well. Long may it continue.</p></body></html>

The best ever adaptation of a comic book to film, great special effects, terrific story and phenomenal direction  make this movie something to see.  The opening credits alone are the most  spectacular of any movie made so far.  The special effects hold up rather  well.  Some of the characters are bit over the top.  Clark Kent may be seen  as a little too wimpy, Otis may be too extreme of a doofus, but they are  surrounded by characters who manage to be wholly credible.  Kudos to Mario  Puzo for his script and story (he also worked on Superman II, and his  absence was noticed on III and IV: The Quest for Peace) The only other  possibly superior interpretation of The Man of Steel is the first season of  Lois and Clark. But still, a movie of this much grandeur and spectacle,  which is superior in every way to all of the Batman movies combined (sorry,  Tim.  Love your work, but this movie is better), should be viewed in its  original widescreen format.  Warner Bros. should get off their butts and  give a good digital remastering and widescreen release onto video and/or  DVD.</p></body></html>

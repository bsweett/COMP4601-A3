<meta name="summary" content="Locked and Loaded"></head><body><p>Shooter to date is by far the most underrated movie of 2007. Do you want a movie with action? How about suspense? Thrills? Shooter has it all.<br /><br />The acting is great and the direction is terrific. The plot is spotted with a few stretches of the imagination, but ultimately Shooter holds up well against some death-defying encounters and a sensational government conspiracy.<br /><br />Based on Stephen Hunter's 1993 novel Point of Impact <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553563513">Point of Impact</a> , Shooter is the story of Bob Lee Swagger (Mark Wahlberg, aka, good vibrating Marky Mark <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000001Y5A">Music for the People</a> ). In Hunter's novel Swagger was a legendary sniper in the Vietnam War. In Shooter we get the 2007 version of Swagger fresh out of conflict in Africa.<br /><br />After the FBI receives a sniper's threat against the President of the United States, Swagger is asked by the FBI to come out of retirement to help prevent the imminent threat. But the tables quickly turn on Swagger when he ends up as the accused assassin. And Swagger goes to war ala Rambo against all that betrayed him.<br /><br />In unexpected role reversals, Danny Glover and Ned Beatty are not in the typical teddy bear roles that they are normally cast, but they do their thing well under the direction of Antoine Fuqua who had success in 2001 with Training Day <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKED">Training Day</a> .<br /><br />Shooter gets a bit politically one-sided at times, but otherwise the entertainment factor outweighs the political bias. I'd highly recommend Shooter to action fans.</p></body></html>

I know that Catwoman was a villain in the Batman comics and movies, but this was a new version for a new generation. Berry plays Patience Phillips, who is a shy artist working for a cosmetics company. While she is delivering a new design to her boss, she overhears a plot to sell defective beauty products that will make your skin decay. She is murdered and reborn after a cat with supernatural abilities breathes new life inside her. Soon, Patience slowly transforms into Catwoman, and tries to bring her killer to justice. I highly recommend CATWOMAN!!!</p></body></html>

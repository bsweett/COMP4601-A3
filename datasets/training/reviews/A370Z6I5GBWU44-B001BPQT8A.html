<meta name="summary" content="Fun and creepy"></head><body><p>This is a classic film with some good actors in it as a series of brutal murders are revealed and then investigated. The first one discovered looks weird to the detectives doing the investigating, and it is not immediately apparent why he died. However, as the second and third crime/murder are discovered, they realize that there's a pattern that follows the seven deadly sins with a twist ending... Ooh! I don't want to say too much because this is a movie you do NOT want to he spoiled for. Rent it and enjoy!</p></body></html>

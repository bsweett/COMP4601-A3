<meta name="summary" content="A Narrow Window into a Historic Event . . ."></head><body><p>We all desire a film with a larger scope and a more generalized portrait of the events of September 11th; nonetheless, this film succeeds at revealing the harrowing experience of a small group of survivors/rescuers. I think that Stone does well in helping us begin to visualize the enormity of Ground Zero.  And this work helps us picture the underground structures in which these two men (and others) were trapped. Additionally, it bravely reveals the miscommunications which caused anguish for hopeful family-members. While some criticize this film for not underscoring the danger posed to the rescuers, I thought Stone did his best . . . as the rescuers/EMTs attempt to crawl to the officers, they are warned that they may die. Over and over, this is emphasized. So, for me, I think the rescuers bravery was well-portrayed.<br /><br />Cage does a phenomenal job with his role as John McLoughlin: he is entirely believable . . . to the point where my companion and I even forgot it WAS Cage. Likewise for Michael Pena. Maggie Gyllenhaal also did a wonderful job at portraying Allison Jimeno: she played the role with quiet grace, thus allowing the emphasis to remain with the men trapped at Ground Zero. Now, that's great acting AND great directing!!<br /><br />There was one seemingly minor problem which became more and more problematic as the film progressed. I know it sounds weird, but Maria Bello was either made to wear OR chose to wear bright-blue contact-lens in her role as Donna McLoughlin. Now, I had never seen this actress in film before and did not know she had dark brown eyes . . . but I DID notice the sloppy contacts and later investigated this on IMDB. The actresses dark brown eyes were not well concealed by these lens and it translated REALLY badly to film. Why does this matter, right?! It matters because every SINGLE time you see THESE HORRIBLE contacts, and BELIEVE ME you cannot miss it, you are reminded that this is a film . . . instead of remaining engaged in the film. From a technical perspective, it disrupts the audience's experience . . . and it a disservice to viewers to be pulled-out of such an important film. But, this is an annoyance which does not negate the overall value of this work!<br /><br />This is a good film which is worth the watch. Moreover, it relieves anxiety that audience members KNOW they are watching a film where the featured police officers are rescued. For many, it is too early to watch a broader film . . . so this depiction of one "small" triumph is just what many need. And this film delivers that hope while STILL ACKNOWLEDGING the tremendous loss.<br /><br />In sum, it is respectful and well-rendered.</p></body></html>

Some (the Majority) will take it with a Smile and be Entertained; others (the Minority) will take it with an "Oooookay" and be Ashamed. Either way you Take it, Everyone has to admit that it is a Gutsy, Full On Adrenaline Rush that Keeps on Keeping on.<p>This "Girl Power" flick had Big, Sticking Bomb written All over it. There were rumours of on-set Squabbles, Over-Budgeting and Script Re-write after Script Re-write. It also featured a First-time Director known only as Mc G and the Overall Tone seemed like it was aiming for "The Avengers" or "The Mod Squad" style Shenanigans, which would have been a Very Bad Idea as those two films were Appallingly Bad. I have to admit, I expected to Hate "Charlies Angels". But on Release day, the Good Reviews absolutely Flooded the Media and I gave it a chance, and Boy am I Glad that I Did.<p>Drew, Cameron and Lucy are Roll Models for the Girls and Drool Inducers for the Boys, There Performances were the Key to the films Success, they are Ultra-Likeable and that was Definitely Necessary. It is also Great to see Bill Murray in a Funny/Silly role again like the ones he Inhabited in a lot of Ivan Reitman films. After "Rushmore" and "Hamlet", I didn't think he'd be Doing any more Out and Out Comic Roles. (The same goes for Tim Curry, he doesn't do enough these days either)<p>The Matrix-ish Fight Sequences, the Awesome Special Effects, the Beautiful Stars, the Great Supporting Cast (which includes Sam Rockwell and Kelly Lynch), the Hysterical Cameos (Tom Green is Side-Splittingly Funny while Matt Le Blanc plays it pretty straight, which he does quite well. Luke Wilson is Sickly-Sweet, in a Good way, and he suits Diaz to a Tee) and the Well-Timed Hair Tossing all combine to make "Charlie's Angels" Pure 5-Star Entertainment.</p></body></html>

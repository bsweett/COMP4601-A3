<meta name="summary" content="A depressing situation  ain't scary,  just depressing"></head><body><p>I found this film to be more depressing than scary. The bulk of it seems focused on the soul numbing daily problems faced by a recently divorced young mother. I wish to forget the "rat-race" part of life when I am in that darkened dream arena, not be plunged eyeball deep in another's. For the most part, whatever few scares there are can easily be explained by natural causes, provided by the film's storyline. The music and overloud/overdramatic sound effects try desperately to drum up the suspense...but grow tiresome when there are no payoffs in the story. It's got a group of good actors that need a story with an arc that includes tension and release, ups and downs of human emotions, scenes that instill dread and suspense...drama. Not unrelenting depressing existence.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Horror, but Michael Caine's Was More Historical"></head><body><p>If you follow my reviews, you know that I felt the version of "Jack the Ripper" with Michael Caine as Inspector Fred Abberline was a phenomenal masterpiece. Not only was Michael Caine outstanding in the role, but that version offered convincing speculation into a mystery that we will never know all the answers to.<br /><br />While I respect this version with Johnny Depp in the role as a great horror flick, it is not nearly as historical as Caine's. (History is to some extent sacrificed for Horror and to some extent Romance.) Some of you may know the Ripper's 5 victims. (Mary Anne Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, kathy Eadows, and Mary Jane Kelly) Well, they have a close friendship, and we get the impression that they share some dangerous secret. (In the Michael Caine version, they knew each other, but they were just associates.)<br /><br />Well, of course, Jack the Ripper comes into play. One scene is well done in that while we don't see his face, we do see some disturbing pictures, and we do see him cutting steak and pouring a dark red wine. In comes Depp (Inspector Fred Abberline.) it is interesting that while the older Michael Caine brought frustration and tremendous energy to the role, Depp makes him look morose and like he is going to die any day. (Perhaps Depp did not want to just imitate Michael Caine.)<br /><br />One thing I have some trouble with is that while Caine had some trouble with his superiors, we could understand Caine's superiors views to some extent. here, it is obvious that Depp's superiors are getting frustrated with him while they are obviously keeping things from him. At least Caine's superiors carried some reason on their side.<br /><br />You'll probably notice that Depp finds things out quicker than Caine did. (Caine had 4 hours. Depp only has 2.) While Caine was involved with an artist, Depp becomes involved with the eventual 5th victim Mary Jane Kelly. Depp of course discovers things that eventually start completeing a puzzle. Like Caine did in his version, Depp ironically gets close and friendly to the killer (obviously without knowing he is talking to the killer).<br /><br />One slight problem I have is that in the Caine version, we can understand more why the killer appeared normal and even offered helpful advice. In this version, it seems strange that the killer is friendly to Depp and offers help. (Jack the Ripper does not have the same split personality here that he did in the Caine version.)<br /><br />I will admit that the scenery is well done, the elements of horror are there, an Depp did a great job of not just imitating Michael Caine. And Depp's Sergeant Godley does offer some entertainment. But if you saw the Michael Caine version, you will undoubtedly miss the probable historical accuracy. On the other hand, this version is geared more towards horror. (So if that is what you want, you won't be disappointed.)<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: Johnny Depp makes Inspector Fred Abberline look like he is going to die any day. In history, he lived on for 40 more years after he stopped Jack the Ripper.</p></body></html>

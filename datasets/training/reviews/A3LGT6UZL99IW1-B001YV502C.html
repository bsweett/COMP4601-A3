<meta name="summary" content="A mediocre romp through an unbelievable future"></head><body><p>Perhaps I just don't "get it."  This was an uninspired romp though the director's vision of a bleak future. There's no back story - except a mysterious reason for infertility. Man has simply given up, with no obvious research being done on the problem. Ignoring the fact that, 1) simultaneous worldwide infertility is a really, really long reach. 2) Every government on the planet collapsing at the same time (except England) is an even longer reach.  Good Science Fiction requires a solid foundation and a believable premise - this film has neither.<br /><br />"Blade Runner" for this generation?  Not even close.  The ending was as much an anticlimax as could be anticipated from such an overhyped film.  Now, if we ignore the script, premise, plot and much of the acting, I'll agree that what's left is great. The sets, directing and photography were phenomenal.  The Nicholas Cage movie "Snake Eyes" used a single, long opening shot to establish the action and feel. This movie is composed primarily of that style of shooting - sometimes to such an extreme that it distracts from the movie (that's a good thing much of the time.)<br /><br />Except for the accents and vehicles, it could have been modern day Bosnia or any other war-torn local.  It's not a Science Fiction movie - it uses a Science Fiction premise as an excuse to create a visualization  of the future that is nothing new or unique.</p></body></html>

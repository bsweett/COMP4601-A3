<meta name="summary" content="A Very Entertaining Movie If You Know What To Expect"></head><body><p>I've seen a lot of bad reviews of the movie but after watching it myself with a low expectation it turned out to not be as awful as I've read.  If you're expecting a great story telling live action remake of the previous 80's version than yes there is going to be some disappointment but if you keep the feeling of expectation to a middle than you'll be more entertained than you'd expect.  Unlike the 80's version this one gives more storyplots with the gods side than the previous one did especially with the sibling rivalry between Hades and Zeus about the fate of humanity and the gods role in it,  also while the new actor who plays Perseus isn't bad personally I preferred Harry Hamlin for the role but that is again because I grew up from watching the 80's version multiple times.  The CGI effects were good not spectacular but still pretty good especially for the new variation of the Kraken.  So if you already have the 80's movie of this and for the price it's going for now I say just add this one to your movie collection you'll not be disappointed....</p></body></html>

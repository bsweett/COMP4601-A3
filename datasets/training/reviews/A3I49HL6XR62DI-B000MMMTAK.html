However, it is original and Sacha Baron Cohen put forth a tour de force performance in "Borat". In my opinion the funniest parts of the film are those in which Cohen as Borat, interacts with people who have no idea who he is. His attempts to give men welcome kisses as he walks the streets of NY are hysterical. The driving lesson is outrageously funny as a real driving instructor, oblivious to the fact that Cohen is acting, tries to cope with Borat's attempts to drink booze while shouting obscenities at other drivers. You will fall down laughing. Another great segment is the ride in the RV with the sexist college frat boys. Cutting edge stuff. However, a lot of the other material falls flat. The rodeo is embarrassing. The nude wrestling scene could have used a good edit. Pamela Anderson obviously knew who Cohen was when he appeared at her "book signing" and it's just not spontaneous. Also -- what happened to the song, "Throw the J**s down the well so my country can be free?" I heard it prior to the film's release; it really made you think about the convenience anti-semitism provides to some folks and, at the same time, was terribly funny. Much better than the National Anthem sequence at the rodeo. Gone in the R-rated version. Also, warning - the scatological humor in "Borat" is just revolting. See the film -- Cohen is amazing. But I'm wondering where he can go from here. I hope his next film has a better editor and is a bit better crafted.</p></body></html>

Liev Schreiber & Julia Stiles take over the roles that were originated by Gregory Peck & Lee Remick, very strongly. Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick takes over of Damien excellently, which was originated by Harvey Stephens (who makes a cameo in the film). John Moore's directing is excellent, this is the second remake (Flight Of The Phoenix in 2004) he has done, but the first remake of his that I have seen the original to. David Seltzer's (who, ironically wrote the original Omen) screenplay is as great as it was 30 years ago. This is probably the second American remake to have its screenplay written from the screenplay that wrote the original. The music by Marco Beltrami (who also did Moore's remake of "Flight Of The Phoenix") is great as Jerry Goldsmith's 30 years ago and ironically Goldsmith trained Beltrami. The cinematography by Jonathan Sela is excellent. The film editing by Dan Zimmerman (first assistant editor on "Flight Of The Phoenix") is excellent. The casting by Susie Figgis & Jessica Horuathova is excellent. The production design by Patrick Lumb (supervising art director on Moore's "Behind Enemy Lines" (2001) & production designer on Moore's "Flight Of The Phoenix") is excellent and better looking than the original. The art direction by Katerina Kopicova & Martin Kurel is excellent. The set decoration by Ladislav Markic & Patrick Smith is excellent. The costume design by George L. Little (who has done the costume design to Moore's "Behind Enemy Lines" & "Flight Of The Phoenix") is excellent.</p></body></html>

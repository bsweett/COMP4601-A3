<meta name="summary" content="kind of stellar, could have done without Snoop Dogg."></head><body><p>why is it that every time a movie is put out, a rapper or a pop trash star has to be in it? rap is not my favorite kind of music, and I almost fell asleep watching this. besides Snoop Dogg, Ben Stiller was acting. Ben Stiller can't act to save his life. Ben Affleck should have played the part of Starsky. I commend Owen Wilson for his acting ability though. Owen was in the movie "Armageddon",so the part of Starsky should have been played by Affleck, or even Adam Sandler, or even Jim Carrey.</p></body></html>

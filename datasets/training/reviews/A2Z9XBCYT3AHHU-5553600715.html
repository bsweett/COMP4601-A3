There were some frightening moments here and there, but the thing that impressed me about the film was the story. It was well done, well written, and moved swiftly through the plot. The arrival of a certain relative in the middle of the film threw me off just slightly, but I understood well after the twist at the end, which, while not as impressive of a surprise as the Sixth Sense, was quite good. <p>Great Film!</p></body></html>

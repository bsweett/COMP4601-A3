<meta name="summary" content="A boy and his dragon, or how to befriend an alien intelligent creature, live the PERFECT first date and end a 300 years old war"></head><body><p>This film is a masterpiece in the "kidult" (kid/adult) movie category. All family will find something to love here - younger children will love the funny dragons and Vikings, teenagers will most probably be seduced by humour and music and the adults will certainly appreciate the most excellent dialogues and especially this incredible first date during which the main hero steals forever the heart of the girl who just one hour earlier furiously, insanely, visceraly and totally hated his guts!<br /><br />Without providing too many SPOILERS, I will try to describe the appeal of this film focusing on four points: the main hero, the First Contact with an alien intelligence, the PERFECT First Date and the PERFECTION of the scenario.<br /><br />1. The hero. From the first moments of the film it is simply impossible to not like, at least a little, a young boy named Hiccup the Useless (a.k.a Hiccup the Horrendous), son of Stoic the Vast, of the tribe of Hairy Hooligans, from the land of Berk...))) Living amongst possibly the proudest and fiercest tribe of all the Vikings, Hiccup has problems to fit in, as he has less muscles and natural born ferocity than his kinsmen.<br /><br />Having suffered from social isolation for most of his life, he developped a very sarcastic and bitter sense of humour, a solid complex of inferiority and a taste for staying away from others, in the safe haven of the workshop of the blacksmith Gobber, of whom he is the only apprentice.<br /><br />It would be however difficult to see him as a loser, as he spend most of his time since early childhood working very hard and also intensely studying - which made him into the chief tinkerer of the whole Viking village and a very promising future blacksmith. However, his love for extravagant contraptions put him in a lot of trouble many times and many Vikings of Berk consider him almost as a threat to the public safety...)))<br /><br />Now, the Vikings of Berk are tough customers, because since 300 years they wage a desperate war against the local dragons. The land of Berk is poor in natural resources and dragons try daily to steal every scrap of food they can find in Viking village - sheep, fish and even chicken are stolen at the first opportunity. Unwilling to starve, the Vikings developped weapons and tactics to fight the various dragons and until now managed to survive. But the fight is getting tougher and tougher and when the story begins the food supplies are running exceptionally low - and the long and cruel winter will be coming soon... In such hard times everybody is needed to fight to the best of his abilities and Hiccup is send finally into military training together with other youths of his age: Fishlegs, Snotlout, twins Tuffnut and Ruffnut and especially Astrid, the girl with whom he is hopelessly in love like since always - and who despises him openly and comes even to hate him passionately...<br /><br />Now, Hiccup, although being weaker and less bloodthirsty than other Vikings, is definitely not a peacenik. He certainly likes tinkering - but what he builds are war engines! He is also all in favour of waging the war - but as the story develops he will realise that it is crucial that his tribe starts waging the RIGHT KIND of war... And ultimately it will become clear that far from being a loser, he is in fact the greatest warrior of his tribe as he will face, defeat and slay the most powerful, terrifying and evil creature that his tribe has ever met! And there are some moments in the story, in which he displays a steel strong determination and he even can be a little bit ruthless... Combined with wits, humour, honor, courage and generous heart, all this makes him a very likeable and exceptionnal hero of a movie for kids... Small wonder that he finally manages to tame the (lovely and clever) shrew whom he loved from the first sight when they were both barely out of their diapers...<br /><br />2. The First Contact with an alien intelligence. Of all the dragons the Vikings of Berk ever faced, there is one, which even the most ferocious warriors fear - the Night Fury! Nobody ever saw the Night Fury and lived to tell the tale, so even after 300 years of war, nobody has any idea how this dragon looks like... But it exists, that much is certain and it is an absolutely deadly creature. The Night Fury is so fast, that it is impossible to see it clearly in the night sky (it comes out of its secret lair only after sunset) and it creates supersonic blasts when it accelerates! Also, its flame blast is exceptionally powerful - so hot, that it is white-blue and so fast, that it hits the target before even people on the ground realise that they are being shot at. And the Night Fury is also more clever than other dragons, always avoiding traps and always attacking in the weak spots of Viking defences. In one word, Night Fury is death.<br /><br />But because of his intelligence and courage (and also a little bit of luck) Hiccup will manage to see this particular dragon - and even better than just see... During the film the teenager and the deadly but intelligent alien creature will establish a truce, then an understanding, then an alliance - and finally a very deep and sincere friendship. This gradual process is shown with a breathtking perfection, a great intelligence and attention to details and tons of humour - and it is very, very touching...<br /><br />3. The PERFECT first date. I will not enter into details here, because it is important that you discover this great moment of cinema unspoiled, but this is one of the most beautiful scenes I saw in a film ever. I am now a married man and a father of two children (so not really a teenager anymore) but the PERFECT first date from this film very pleasantly reminded me of this time in life when the world seems to smile to us, when the sky is singing, when nothing else counts that this magic moment and when everything is good, pure, beautiful and exactly as it should be... Allow yourself to open your heart beginning with the scene in which Astrid beats Hiccup with her fists and the handle of her battleaxe (definitely a required thing for the PERFECT first date) and let yourself be seduced by the magic of everything that follows. Believe me, you will not regret it...<br /><br />4. The perfection of the scenario. The film makes a full circle and the ending of the story connects perfectly with its beginning (including a very clever use of words "pest" and "pet"). There is not even one moment of weakness. There is absolutely no one scene which could be deleted without harming the film and I can hardly imagine what else could have been added. The dialogues are simply perfect - full of wit and humour, they all have their importance. All characters are very well developped - other than Hiccup, Astrid and the Night Fury, those who are the most crucial are Stoic the Vast and Gobber. A good thing is that the film doesn't bash any characters - there is no "bad guys" amongst the Vikings and even when Stoic the Vast makes a huge mistake of judgment we can actually very well understand his reasons - and also there is no doubt that although pigheaded and very conservative, he is nevertheless a very brave and absolutely selfless man, entirely dedicated to the survival of his tribe. A very succesful character is Fishlegs, a somehow obese young Viking who clearly played too much "Dungeons and Dragons", as he knows all the dragon statistics by heart... As a long time ADD player myself I laughed out loud during all his nerdy comments and interventions...)))<br /><br />The story gets quite serious towards the end, by showing that the real evil (with capital E, V, I, L and an exclamation mark) can not be ignored, escaped or appeased - it must be faced, fought, defeated and mercilessly eraditcated. But when there is a fight there are casualties on both sides and there is no blodless victories - and so even the greatest triumph brings its part of grief, loss and sorrow. The great thing about "How to train your dragon" is that although there is a happy ending, it is not precisely an eezy peezy pink candy sweet kind of happy ending - it is a surprisingly serious happy ending in which relief, happiness and cheerfulness are mixed with just a tiny little bit of sadness (not enough to make little kids cry though).<br /><br />Bottom line, this film is a treasure and a pleasure. If you didn't see it, go get it. It will make you laugh a lot, cheer you up no matter how bad was your day. And the PERFECT first date scene will mend many wounds that time unavoidably inflicted to your heart (as it did to all of us) and certainly make you smile with just the right kind of nostalgy (if you are a fully grown up adult) ot just the right kind of expectation (if you are still in your early teens). ENJOY!</p></body></html>

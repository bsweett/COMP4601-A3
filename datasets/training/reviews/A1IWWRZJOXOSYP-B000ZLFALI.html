Comparisons to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000077VR3">Moulin Rouge! (Widescreen Edition)</a> are well-founded.  Julie Taymor, whose last film in 2002 was the visually stunning <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLPK">Frida</a>, brings those skills to this project.  Usually, American audiences have to go to Chinese cinema such as "Heroes" or "House of Flying Daggers" to see such visual creativity.  Also starring in this production is the incredible music of the Beatles that holds up well today, even the more lyrically challenging songs like "I Am the Walrus."  I appreciated the way that the script used the songs to carry the story forward from the first opening song on the beach, "Is there anybody going to listen to my story all about a girl who came to stay" through to the end of the film.<br /><br />Taymor brings new faces to the screen who have been cast with a master eye since they fit so well and perform so brilliantly.  Lucy is played by Evan Rachel Wood who performed in one of my favorite films of 2005, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNP4">The Upside of Anger</a>.  She shows great range as an actress and is in good voice in the film.  Jude is played by Jim Sturgess who has acted in quite a few British TV shows.  He does a great job as the guy from across the ocean who comes and gives perspective to the cultural unrest during the Vietnam era.  Joe Anderson who played Henry Austen in Becoming Jane plays Max Carrigan, Lucy's brother.  All three of the leads act and sing amazingly well.<br /><br />The supporting players are also a strong cast.  Newcomer Dana Fuchs plays Sadie, the landlady rock star.  Her rock numbers are show-stopping stunners.  JoJo the lead guitarist is played by Martin Luther McCoy.  T.V. Caprio does a good job as Prudence who comes in through the bathroom window.  Lucy's boyfriend who is killed in Vietnam is named Daniel and played by Spencer Liff who recently played in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W4KT64">Hairspray (Full-Screen Edition)</a>.  Rocker Joe Cocker plays the bum, the pimp & the mad hippie while U2's Bono plays the crazed Dr. Robert.  Eddie Izzard's talk/sing and inane additions to Mr. Kite were the only part of the film that didn't work so well for me, although visually it was stunning.<br /><br />The one sequence that resonated with me was when Max has to report for induction into the army.  The military strips the guys down to briefs or boxers; and they slide across conveyor belts.  This segues into one of the most stunning images of underwear-clad inductees tromping through the jungle carrying the Statue of Liberty on their backs.  The film achieves a universal appeal as we relate the war of yesterday to the war of today.  "Across the Universe" is an excellent piece of cinema, one I'm sure to want to play repeatedly when the DVD is released.  Bravo!</p></body></html>

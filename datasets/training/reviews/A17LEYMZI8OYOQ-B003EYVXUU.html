<meta name="summary" content="A Haunting Love Story"></head><body><p>I'm not a big fan of horror movies, but this one really had me.  It's the most engrossing horror film I've seen in years.<br /><br /> Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is a lonely kid, mercilessly bullied at school, whose parents are divorcing.  One winter night, he meets Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz), a girl who has just moved into the apartment complex and never wears shoes.<br /><br /> Abby is a vampire, trapped in a child's body, and her "father" (Richard Jenkins) is actually her protector.  Not only does he go out and kill people so that Abby can have blood, but when she does the dastardly deed herself, he disposes of the body.<br /><br /> Both friendless, Owen and Abby bond and it is a relationship that endures even after the young man learns the truth about the strange girl.<br /><br /> Adapted by director Matt Reeves (CLOVERFIELD) from a Swedish novel by John Ajvide Lindqvist, LET ME IN is both a horror film and a heart-wrenching tale about the pain of adolescence.  Abby may kill people in order to survive, but she is also a victim.  She didn't ask to become a vampire.<br /><br /> The picture is dark and violent, though much of the blood-letting (wisely) happens off-screen.  It is also a love story that will haunt you long after the movie ends.<br /><br />? Michael B. Druxman</p></body></html>

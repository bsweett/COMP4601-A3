<meta name="summary" content="&quot;You really think you have a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy?&quot;"></head><body><p>This is one of those action films that actually deserved to be called a modern classic.  In the film, Bruce Willis (currently the brooding lead of such films as &quot;Unbreakable&quot;) is a smart-mouthed New York cop who visits Los Angeles to attend a Christmas party at a building where his wife is working.  &quot;Terrorists&quot; arrive to spoil the preceedings, leaving Willis alone, exhausted, barefoot, and the only one who can stop them.  Despite it's numerous and carbon-copy immitators, &quot;Die Hard&quot; is a great action epic, and it's displayed quite nicely in this new 5-star DVD release.  First off, you get two audio commentaries: one with director John McTiernan and production designer Jackson DeGovia explaining the difficulties of starting a movie that DIDN'T have a ending set in stone and filming in a studio-owned building, and a second one with visual effects supervisor Richard Edlund explaining some technical aspects of the film and the secret behind Bruce Willis' &quot;barefoot&quot; performance.  A text commentary (like the text commentary on &quot;The Abyss&quot; DVD) is also available where the film is analyzed through numerous interviews with the actors, producers, and film critics.  On the second disc, there's a good amount of stuff to keep you busy.  There's a deleted scene (also on the first disc) and some outtakes, trailers, TV ads, articles on the film, the script (NOT just in DVD-ROM form), and a slick little treat called &quot;The Cutting Room&quot;.  Here, you can see how elements work in some of the big scenes in this film by either changing takes or playing with the sound.  Also, for you people confused with the difference between widescreen and fullscreen, you get a nice demonstration piece to show you the difference.  All in all, if you like the film, this is a definite keeper for your DVD collection.</p></body></html>

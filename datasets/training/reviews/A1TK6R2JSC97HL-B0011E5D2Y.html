<meta name="summary" content="Wilson & Vaughn keep this party going"></head><body><p>Vince Vaugh and Owen Wilson are "The Wedding Crashers".  Most of the year, they're gifted and successful DC-based divorce mediators - talented enough yet jaded by their work to know that the happiest part of marriage ends with the wedding.  During wedding season itself, though, they change into uninvited guests who bring an almost super-professional precision to the art of worming into the lavish affairs of total strangers, and the arms of the many nubile bridesmaids that only seem to exist there.  Though mooching off well-healed spouses, John & Jeremy are easily the, life of any party.  (So much so, that you begin to wonder just who's really mooching off whom.)  While both are idea men of seeming limitless guile, Wilson's John brings the brains while Vince Vaughn's Jeremy has the high octane oomph that gets him past many would-be disasters.<br /><br />Trouble brews when John gets the two of them to crash the wedding of the Treasury Secretary's daughter.  Christopher Walken (doing well cast against type as the old-politics, old money scion) falls for John & Jeremy's cover-story at his daughter's tony nuptials and invites them home for the weekend when he sees them charm his remaining daughters.  Despite his invented life with Jeremy (in search of the loveliest bridesmaids and the most delectable finger-foods) John seems gamely attracted to the beautiful and conscientious Claire, While Jeremy finds himself in the clutches of Gloria, Walken's character's beautiful sociopath of a daughter.  Not much makes sense here - does John really think he'll charm Claire for keeps?  (The story greases things by making Sack Lodge, Claire's suitor, an utter cad.)  The thin plot of "Crashers" contains enough tricks to save it from having to answer simple questions like that - Walken's on-screen family are loveless and clueless utter misanthropes who've sacrificed their emotional and intellectual lives for appearances. (John & Jeremy have managed the same trick, but never had to give anything up, and only have to maintain the illusion for a few hours at a time.)  Our heroes are too self-respecting to give up a good party, even if that means a few nights on Christopher Walken's private island of horrors.  The story tosses in Walken's tortured and gay artist of a son and his addled mother.  It gets slow at times but "Wedding Crashers" ably works off the magic of Wilson's earnest platitudes about love and Vaughn's compulsive search for a good time.<br /><br />In short, this is the perfect antidote for those left bleak by "Sideways".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Hollywood action/special effects film that does the job!"></head><body><p>&quot;Hang on -- this isn't going to be subtle!&quot; says the hotshot NASA pilot as he prepares to crash-land the space shuttle in the dry concrete basin of the L.A. River...  As good an introduction to this film as you're likely to get.  This science fiction/natural disaster movie was a very pleasant surprise!  It's about an intrepid group of super-scientists who take a fantastic voyage to the Earth's molten core, in order to prevent global catastrophe.  Y'see, it seems the lava inside the planet has stopped spinning for some reason, causing all of nature to go haywire, and threatens our very existence. Which is very bad.  So, the US government assembles a scrappy little Scooby team, and off they go, to die one-by-one and make heroic sacrifices as they meet their dates with Destiny.  This flick was pretty fun &amp; funny in a complete-suspension-of-disbelief kinda way... It doesn't take itself too seriously, and thus never flounders by trying to make everything seem &quot;real.&quot; In fact, the humor (which draws on some great, casual one-liners and fine performances all around, particularly the laconic, good-natured college professor, played by Aaron Eckhart) skillfully disarms us to the special effects sequences are all the more enjoyable.  The &quot;science&quot; is ridiculous, but who cares?  The film is a gas!</p></body></html>

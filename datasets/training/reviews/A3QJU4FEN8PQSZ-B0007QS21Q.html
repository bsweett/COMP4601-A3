<meta name="summary" content="Goofy/Big Bird vs. the Robots"></head><body><p>This might have been a great movie, but it's impossible to get past Smith's gawkiness and "attitude", lending a clownish cast to his character. The whole tone of the movie is colored by his misguided acting. All seriousness is lost in his silly quips and awkward costuming. "Somehow 'I told you so' doesn't quite say it." Horrible scripting in many instances. "This thing doesn't run on gas, does it? Gas explodes, you know!" Yuck. Thanks for ruining it, Big Bird.<br /><br />And the CGI is not too impressive either. The sight of swarms of robots jumping around like grasshoppers doesn't exactly inspire awe; looks more like a bad scene from a videogame. Although I liked the concept of cables for muscles.<br /><br />But how about the story? As I mentioned, it's totally dominated by Smith's "Bad Boys" persona and his ridiculous costumes which accentuate his ears (and earrings). His strutting and brooding and constant throwing around of his weight crowd out any serious consideration of the plot. It's jarring. It's a complete mismatch for this type of movie. They might as well have cast Jon Lovitz in the part.<br /><br />But perhaps this was necessary, as the plot has huge gaps in logic. Why do robots in the dark seek out light? asks one of the characters. Well, all musings on AI aside, it must be a function of programming. Everything about them is, even when they behave unpredictably. I guarantee you there is a subroutine in their brains that, when certain conditions are met, fires off a command to move towards the light. Nothing profound about that. The only mystery arises from our ignorance of those necessary conditions.<br /><br />The movie is further ruined by some silly "big air" gunfighting from Smith, again completely out of place in this movie.<br /><br />And why does he hate robots so much? You'll laugh until you cry when you find out. And then you'll want to slap him silly.<br /><br />Oh. And another thing. It's implausible that we would manufacture robots of such strength and, well, hardness without some easy way to disable them, just in case. It's just too scary for us otherwise - that's human nature. No one wants to be in a building at night with an automaton that can pull your head off if its software or hardware fails - talk about Blue Screen of Death.<br /><br />Finally, there is no conflict regarding the three laws in the movie, so don't expect any philosophical musings in that regard. The issue is cheaply circumvented.</p></body></html>

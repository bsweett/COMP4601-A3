<meta name="summary" content="The Polar Express"></head><body><p>"The Polar Express" is the story of an unnamed boy who does not believe in Santa anymore.  On Christmas Eve night, while lying in bed, hears a train outside his window.  When goes outside to see what it is, he finds the Polar Express, which is on its way to the North Pole.  So begins his adventure.  Along the way, he will meet other children, a mysterious hobo, and have some amazing adventures, before arriving at the North Pole in time to see Santa off on the busiest night of his year.<br /><br />"The Polar Express" is both impressive and disappointing at the same time.  The characters are animated using motion capture performance, mostly done by Tom Hanks.  The characters look somewhat real, but are just enough off to look creepy at times (specifically the little girl, the elves, and the waiters).  The movements seem a little odd at times, and that is difficult to explain because they are based on real movements.  Perhaps it is just the animation.  The overall animation is impressive though.  The Polar Express and North Pole are fully realized in all their glorious detail.<br /><br />The songs are unmemorable, but the performances by Tom Hanks are good.  He gives life to numerous characters, some of them children, in such a way that you believe that they seem real and true to their age.  The story has been modified from the book in order to accomidate a longer running time, and it works to some extent.  The movie moves swiftly for the most part.<br /><br />In the end, "The Polar Express" will probably become a childrens' holiday classic.  I would not call it the best Christmas movie ever, but more likely than not, children will find enjoyment in the story of a child who learns to believe again.</p></body></html>

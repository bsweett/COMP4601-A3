<meta name="summary" content="Do We Really Need Bigger And Better ...And Aliens?"></head><body><p>***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***<br /><br />Although able to spark a significant <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4ONE">Indiana Jones</a> sense of nostalgia, and add a possible newcomer to the ranks of what might be future Indiana Jones films, there's not much else to Spielberg's latest adventure film ...except an ending that harkens back to the not-so-good <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXXP">Artificial Intelligence</a> film.<br /><br />Understandably Spielberg was waiting for the perfect script, but Harrison Ford wasn't getting any younger, so it is my assumption that Spielberg took the leap and decided to direct a so-so film rather than let Ford's character forever fall into obscurity. The film itself isn't necessarily so-so, but the concept and ending are not, shall we say, in keeping with the Indiana Jones film mentality.<br /><br />Although I'm no Harrison Ford fan, I did enjoy his early work on such films as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FQJAIW">Star Wars</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UBMWG4">Blade Runner</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/078322737X">American Graffiti</a>. His later work became mundane and unexceptional, myself only being able to see Harrison Ford playing Harrison Ford and not the character(s) I was supposed to see. But the Indian Jones series was an entirely different ball-game. Funny. Action-packed. Historically ...strange. And just fun to watch. These are the things that make for entertaining cinema. And although this fourth installment in the Indiana Jones films carries many of those items, it does not carry it all the way to its newfound ending.<br /><br />And speaking of newfound, Shia LaBeouf (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KB489I">A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints</a>) as Mutt Williams, Indiana's spawn and possible successor, was a very good idea. He's cocky, strangely funny, and enough not like Indy to make the character believable. The sword fights on top of careening cars as they travel through the jungle and disrupt his testicular fortitude were just the right amount of zany action and ridiculous comedy that needed infusing into the story.<br /><br />Nostalgic-wise, the incorporation of Indiana and his love for his hat are immediately taken to heart as we witness him being ripped from the trunk of a car by communists, the main one being Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000067DNF">The Lord of the Rings</a>), a sword-carrying and tough spy in the likes of actor Paul Freeman who played Rene Belloq in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4OMU">The Raiders of the Lost Ark</a>. Most Indy fans will also be very happy to see Karen Allen reprise her role as Marion, Indiana Jones' love interest from the first film. Although the years show heavily on Mrs. Allen, she's still spunky enough to give a fine performance.<br /><br />Lovers of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016GLZW4">original score</a> will also be happy how it was folded into this latest release, portions of the music being liberally sprinkled throughout the story. The filming used for Indiana Jones 4 did not use digital cameras, so the original style can also be seen and felt by the viewing audience.<br /><br />Where the story begins to crumble, however, is in the storyline that reuses old themes from the Raiders film (anyone who looks at or knows what they shouldn't is wiped off the planet), and adds Spielberg's heavy-handed sense of science fiction that helped destroy the end of the aforementioned Artificial Intelligence movie ("It's a portal to another realm!") The crystal skull(s) also just seemed like a key to a puzzle that easily could've been solved by anyone, not just the supposedly adept Jones (and his new prodigy). Which makes the "alien" ending seem all the more ludicrous.<br /><br />My assumption is that Hollywood and Spielberg himself think that audiences need something bigger, better, and more spectacular than the last. That's not necessarily true, especially when dealing with nostalgic cinema the likes of Indiana Jones. Audiences will come because they want that old timey feel, not something bigger, better, and more "alien" than before.<br /><br />Regardless of this film's failings, it is entertaining. The action is practically nonstop throughout its 124 minute length, making it seem shorter than it actually was. That's something, I guess.</p></body></html>

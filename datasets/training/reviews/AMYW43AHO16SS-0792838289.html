<meta name="summary" content="John Frankenheimer's Masterpiece!!"></head><body><p>Frank Sinatra proved time and time again that we was an all around entertainer with his powerful acting job.  Laurence Harvey is outstanding as the doomed brainwashed victim.  But Angela Landsbury steals the show as the power hungry mother.  This movie still sends chills up my spine.  It's director John Frankenheimer's greatest movie he ever made.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sharp, Witty, Excellent"></head><body><p>From the opening scene with Pitt and Jolie and the unseen therapist, it was clear that this movie was going to be a cut above the unsual far. It did not dissapoint. Sharp, witty, smart writting, excellent performances. The movie is like an extended metaphor for the trails and tribulations of modern marriage. Fortunately it does not lay message on too thickly. This movie is not original, the original one was made in 1941.<br /><br />P.S. What ever happen to the "steamy sex scene' with Brad Pitt and Jolie. Was it censored? The movie will do way better with that scene!</p></body></html>

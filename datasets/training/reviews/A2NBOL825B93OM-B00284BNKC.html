<meta name="summary" content="A punch in the stomach"></head><body><p>"Requiem for a dream" has two separate stories, yet connected through family ties and drug-abuse. <p>The first story is about Sara (Ellen Burstyn, the same from "The exorcist", if you can believe it). Sara is a middle-aged woman, overweight, addicted to watching television. When she receives a phone call telling her she will be on some TV show, it's the moment of her life. She has a red dress that she hasn't worn in some time and she can't wear it again because of her weight problem. So, she sees a doctor that tells her to take some pills instead of taking meals. Soon she is addicted and obcessed to the pills, and her life goes down the drain. <p>The second story is about Sara's son, Harry (Jared Leto, from "My so-called life" and "Panic room"), his girlfriend, played by Jennifer Connely (before "A beautiful mind") and his friend played by Marlon Wayans. The lives of these three characters are already down the drain, because they're heroine addicts, and everything they do is in order to get more of the stuff. <p>All four mentioned actors have impressive performances. Ellen Burstyn's transformation during the film is amazing. Her performance won her nominations for both the Academy and Golden GLobe awards (and she lost to Julia Roberts, proving that what wins these prizes is lobbying, not acting). Jared Leto is also very good, but he doesn't change much from the introspective and  quiet characters he is used to play. Marlon Wayans surprised me doing a serious character, also very good. But Jennifer Connelly's performance, in my opinion, was the strongest. For once, she put aside her good looks and concentrated in doing a drug addict, sometimes ugly, desperate, puffy face, running nose, etc.<p>Before watching the movie, I saw an interview with the director, Aronofsky, saying he wanted to provide the viewers with an emotional roller-coaster. There is no roller coaster in the movie, it's all plainly downhill from beginning to end. I found  interesting some of the technics used by the director, like using mostly closed sets (specially towards the end), showing the prison-like life the characters were going into; and the camera attached to the actors' bodies, closing on their faces, was also different from what I'm used to watching in movies.<p>The title is perfect for this movie. What is the "Requiem for a dream"? It's when you look back through your life and you realise that it wasn't as close as what you'd wanted it to be, you only spent the chance you'd got for living.<p>Grade 9.0/10</p></body></html>

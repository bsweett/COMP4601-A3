Much as I really like and respect Kevin Spacey and consider him a great actor, and while he does a great job here, this was more about his ego and dream role than it was about Bobby Darin. WAY too many parts about Darin's life were glossed over or even ignored, and important ones at that. The dance numbers and "kid" sequences were out of place and slowed things down. Sorry, Kevin. While you were outstanding, Bobby deserves way better that just near-blind idol-worship. He was deeper than that.</p></body></html>

Takin' 'er easy for all us sinners.""></head><body><p>In "Big Lebowski" (1998) -a weird, nutty, outrageously funny and deliciously twisted movie, the brothers Ethan and Joel Coens, known for their unique dry and more often than not dark humor, sit back, laugh out loud, and have fun. Big Lebowski is IMO one of the top funniest comedies ever made. It is funny because of the incredibly off-beat characters, their weirdness, flaws, their interaction, the surreal situations they found themselves in, and perfectly written and delivered hilarious dialogs. There is the story of course which is based on the case of mistaken identity with the following kidnapping, villainous nihilists, vanguard erotic flying painter, the bowler named Jesus, etc but the story is truly secondary to the beautiful craziness of the movie. I've read many reviews that call Big Lebowski a mess, saying that the story is convoluted, call it misfire and deranged, with the characters we would not care about a bit. It was also interesting to read the reviews that were written upon its release and compared it to Coens' "Fargo" that had been made a year earlier than the adventure of Jeffrey "the Dude" Lebowski. I agree that "Fargo" is Coens' masterwork but it does not make BL any worse. It was dismissed as the inferior film and was predicted not to stand the future re-watch. How wrong the prediction was. "The Dude" Lebowski - middle-aged pot smoking, White Russian drinking, bowling enthusiast -ex hippie and his friends, Polish Catholic converted Jew, more Jewish than Tevye Viet Nam veteran Walter with anger management problems (John Goodman) and timid, little slow, "sweet prince" Donnie (unusually quiet Steve Buscemi) have become the cult figures, the beloved characters, even more than just the characters for millions of film lovers of different generations, not only the baby boomers. Our younger son came home for Christmas holidays couple of weeks ago, and we were talking about and quoting BL, one of his all time favorite movies in our conversations - we always do. He gave me the DVD couple of years ago for my birthday, and the movie has become one of my favorite comedies since that time, too. Ironically, I did not like it much after the first viewing ten years ago. It seemed too surreal, loud, and strange. Now it is different - I can't get enough of it. While our son was visiting, Big Lebowski was shown on TV in the beautiful crisp HD presentation. Once again, I laughed so much and so hard that I was afraid to ruin my rug which really ties the room together in the same manner Dude's was. Great and immortal fun, THE cult picture for as long as people watch movies.<br /><br />While writing about Big Lebowski, I looked up the Coens' resume. They've made only 13 films, and all of them are treasures, including their contribution in the 2006 anthology, Paris, je t'aime (2006). I've seen all their films and I want to repeat the title of my review on their latest, "Burn after reading" - Brother Coen don't make bad movies, they don't know how. Their films should not be missed - they all are clever, darkly funny, and beautiful without being pretty pictures, in short, first class entertainment. There are only two working directors whose movies I always see upon release in the theater, preferably, during the first weekend - Woody Allen and the writing/directing team, Ethan and Joel Coen.</p></body></html>

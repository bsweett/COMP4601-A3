<meta name="summary" content="Into the depths of criminality"></head><body><p>"The Usual Suspects" seems at first to be the typical tale of a gang of urban criminals. But each minute brings the viewer deeper and deeper into a world in which things are not as they seem. The plot tentacles from the low-life antics of a group of five LA criminals into a global network of criminal enterprise and motivations that is difficult to imagine.<br /><br />The tale is told mostly from the vantage point of 'Verbal' Kint, a small time criminal who is being interrogated by the police. Kint retells a story that starts when he was unexpectedly included in a lineup that includes the other four - the "usual suspects" of the title. There is a police shakedown going on, the unraveling of which becomes the central story line of the entire film.<br /><br />Great performances, especially by Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton, the one-time big operator trying to go straight and by Pete Postlethwaite as Kobayashi, the laconic fixer-in-chief of a mysterious Bulgarian named Keyser S&ouml;ze.<br /><br />Well-written and captivating from beginning to end.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sofia Coppola's weakest delivery so far"></head><body><p>Perhaps I am setting a high bar for Sofia Coppola, talented actress, writer and director.  Surely, after her highly successful "Lost in Translation" movie for which she won an Oscar for screenplay we were all expecting a lot from her.  While this movie relished in beautiful costumes, interior design and architecture, it totally misses on providing  a more suitable musical score or background on French Revolution and the mob that offed this unfortunate queen.  I do not understand the awe about Kristen Dunst's performance.  I found Danny Huston and Jason Schwartzmann's performances to be superior in spite of the fact that their roles were smaller.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="classic Hitchcock"></head><body><p>This is probably Hitchcock's greatest film.  It stands up alongside REAR WINDOW and PSYCHO as his great opus.<p>Cary Grant teams with Hitchcock for the fourth and final time in this benchmark espionage journey that was recently judged by the AFI as one of their top 100 films.<p>Grant plays a Madison Avenue executive who becomes mistaken for a Government agent by a team of spies led by James Mason.  He unwillingly becomes involved in a series of misadventures and is pursued across the States by both the spies and the Government whilst being helped along the way by a beautiful ice-cool blonde secret agent (Eva Marie Saint).<p>This all-new restoration boasts a beautiful Dolby 5.1 sound mix and a pristine picture.  Outstading acting, the unforgettable cropdusting sequence and Bernard Herrmann's nerve-jangling score all combine in this classic, superlative Hitchcock.<p>Also featuring Jessie Royce Landis.<p>The DVD includes the retrospective featurette &quot;Destination Hitchcock: The Making of 'North By Northwest'&quot; hosted by Eva Marie Saint, TV spots, trailers, audio commentary by screenwriter Ernest Lehman, still gallery and a music-only track.</p></body></html>

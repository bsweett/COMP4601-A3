<meta name="summary" content="Very good, but not worthy of being a classic"></head><body><p>Like many folks, I am revisiting the old "Batman" series after viewing "Batman Begins". "Batman" is definitely one of Tim Burton's best films and a great take on the DC Comics "Batman" series.<br /><br />Michael Keaton in many ways is much more believable as taciturn and brooding Bruce Wayne than Batman.  Jack Nicholson (The Joker) more often than not steals the show as well as wreaking no end of havoc on Gotham City.  He's got the best lines and Nicholson is very hard to play against---good man or bad.<br /><br />The effects are still good and the action still keeps you glued to your seat, but the soundtrack doesn't fare so well.  Prince may have had many of us rocking in the 80s, but he's just not as worthy of the title classic as other artists.</p></body></html>

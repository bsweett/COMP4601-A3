Love the camera work, each shot carefully composed; the deserted city a landscape not unlike Monument National Park.  Then the music quickens as the lone character strolls through the emptiness; is he really alone?  Even when he meets others, how tenous the relationships?  (Loved how the imagery went from vast to boxed in, chopped up, limiting; the rush up a stairwell.)  This was a cleverly thought out film with many set pieces to lift it out of a well-worn genre.  Trust was a major issue.  Also the gravity of their situation which sometimes they risked by overlooking the obvious; things have changed.  How do you live in a world that wasn't as safe as it was 29 days ago?<br />Very thoughtful, with a few scary bits thrown in (scary, because perception and reality often became confused, and that could get you killed).<br /><br />It's a keeper!</p></body></html>

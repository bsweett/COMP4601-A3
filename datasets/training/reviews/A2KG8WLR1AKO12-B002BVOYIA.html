<meta name="summary" content="The Moral Bankruptcy of Postmodernist Liberalism"></head><body><p>Don Cheadle is simply fantastic portraying the courageous Paul Rusesabagina, the hotel manager who risks everything to save the lives of those targeted for death.  Paul naively thinks that the Western World will never allow genocide to take place.  He realizes too late that liberals are inclined toward pacifist remedies.  Also, the fact that some white soldiers would inevitably have to shoot black thugs does not help things.  Political correctness reigns supreme within the halls of the West's liberal institutions.  Paul and his wife Sophie (Tatiana Rusesabagina) are living the good life.  They are educated and economically well off.  The ethnic differences between the Hutu and Tutsi are not relevant to them.  They soon learn that others don't agree.  Some will not hesitate to massacre even the infants of their ethnic opposites.  We watch as the horror unfolds.  It appears that Colonel Oliver (Nick Nolte) is able to stop the murderers when push comes to shove.  And yet his superiors will not allow him to employ violence regardless of the circumstances.  This is, needless to add, not escapist entertainment.  I hate to guilt trip anybody, but perhaps it is a moral imperative to see Hotel Rwanda from beginning to end.  Who said that you have a right to look the other way?<br /><br />Hotel Rwanda should have been made around ten years ago.  Unfortunately, the liberal Hollywood establishment most likely desired to protect both President Bill Clinton and the the ineffective Kofi Annan.  I'm sure that a lot of people wanted to stop the making of Hotel Rwanda.  The United Nations comes across as feckless and impotent.  Why does it exist?  What purpose does it serve?  These are unavoidable questions which will haunt you.  Director Terry George has put together a great film.  I cannot praise him enough.  There is no question but that Hotel Rwanda earns five stars.</p></body></html>

Ofelia, the girl in this story, journeys only to the border of this "other land".  I thought that this movie would delve deeper into this strange land and its inhabitants.<br /><br />Ofelia and her widowed pregnant mother move to an abandoned mill to be with the new stepfather/husband.  The stepfather is a military captain who is fighting against guerilla army that seems to be invisible.  However, the captain is a cruel man.  He is just harsh to everyone.<br /><br />Upon arrival at the mill, Ofelia discovers a shape-shifting fairy.  The fairy leads her to a world underground.  From there, she meets an ancient faun.  The faun tells her that she of a royal lineage.  But, before she can return to the royal lineage, she must do 3 tasks that comes with explicit instructions.<br /><br />I just love the everything about this movie.  However, it just left me wishing for more of this other world.  It was such a big tease to get a "taste" of this world.  My favorite was this episode where Ofelia was given a magic chalk to retrieve an object.  In this room was a creature who use its hand to see.  You just got to see the movie to see what I'm talking about.  I thought that was such an original idea.<br /><br />I love how this fairy tale wasn't always so gleefully bright.  I love how suspense were used.  I loved how it left you uncertain if the faun was "good guy" or a "bad guy" with its own agenda.  *Pan's Labyrinth* was a refreshing break from these predictable films.<br /><br />I certainly hope that del Toro will direct something like thing very soon.</p></body></html>

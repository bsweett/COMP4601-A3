We've all been accustomed to seeing Christmas music on display well before Halloween has come and gone.  This idea was given full reign in `<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019KAQEU">It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown</a>,' with the late Charles M. Schultz's wonderful take on Halloween when Linus gets mixed up between Santa Claus and the famous, fictitious legend who delivers toys on Halloween night.  This is where Tim Burton's `The Nightmare Before Christmas' takes off, but from there all parallels stop, and flair takes the helm for this truly unique animated adventure.<br /><br />The story is uncomplicated enough.  Jack Skellington (Danny Elfman), an emaciated man who is charming in character and sinister in appearance, is the figure head of Halloweentown, and the key figure of the most anticipated holiday of the village.  November 1st as one might expect, is a let-down, and a down-cast Jack finds himself wandering through a forest all night long.<br /><br />At the end of his journey, he discovers the North Pole and all the inhabitants surrounding Christmas's festive figure, Santa Claus.  Noting that there is something different abound, he goes back to Halloween Town and brings all he sees back to the people.  Feeling inadequate to convey the warmth of the season, he plots with three mischievous children to kidnap Ole Saint Nick and have the secrets of gift giving unfold for his town.<br /><br />Embellishing the story are some offbeat characters.  Ragdoll Sally (Catherine O'Hara) is captive to the nasty Dr. Finkelstein (William Hickey) in a Rapunzel-like subplot.<br /><br />`The Nightmare Before Christmas' could have been a one note wonder, but what I like about it is the charm factor.  In the midst of a cute and macabre background (I'd never thought that would mix until seeing this film.), delightful songs and memorable characters fill the screen.  It doesn't exactly come off like Lucille Ball singing "We Need a Little Christmas," but the sojourn from a dark world yearning to be lighter is worth taking indeed.<br /><br />A J.P.'s Pick 5 *'s =Exceptional<br /><br />Happy Halloween! ;>)</p></body></html>

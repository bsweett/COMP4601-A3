I have reservations, but we'll get to that in a moment.  Meryl Streep doesn't have to effect a foreign accent in The Devil Wears Prada, but she is a mean iceberg, which is against type I guess. Her "Emily," what Streep calls her assistants, they don't last long, so they're all called Emily.  Anne Hathaway with the slim figure and botox lips plays the swell journalist student with a short, chef boyfriend, living as if they were on a Friends" style sitcom in the big city. Their existence is chic shabby post college. "Yeah, we're working [...] jobs and livin' in a cracker barrel, but aren't old sweaters and skirts cool? Apparently not as Hathaway has somehow fallen upon the chance-of-a-lifetime job in the fashion industry she really doesn't want for she is a journalist you see.  Working for Streep, a fashion icon, playing footsy with handsome millionaires, and driving around in limos in a whirl of designer glamour, or attending runway shows in Paris are so, so, faux.<br /><br />Now we have the Cinderella story told to a delighted audience of sophisticated women and their jaded boyfriends. I'd say, okay, get the woman her coffee and make sure her plane can get out of LA in the middle of a tornado or blizzard, so that Paris Fashion might survive another day.  Remember all the little people that make it happen.  I'm paraphrasing one of Streep's restrained speeches on why Hathaway has clothes on her back.<br /><br />The question, shall a woman have career or a simple life with her boring boyfriend in Boston? Let's see, glamour, maids to wait on you hand and foot, and high style versus family and screaming babies in a small apartment?  Hmmm, what would the lady choose? Come on Hollywood.  Tell them the truth.  Success is good and self-imposed failure stinks.</p></body></html>

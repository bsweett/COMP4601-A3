<meta name="summary" content="Over-hyped, Tedious Mess"></head><body><p>The mere thought of an EXTENDED version of "American Gangster" makes me want to run.  Why would a movie viewer subject themselves to adding more tediousness to an already tedious film?  As with any Denzel movie, the acting is great, but... the story is really, really unfocused.  Yes, it's based on a true story, but movies and books are supposed to tell a coherent, focused tale, and "American Gangster" very simply doesn't.<br /><br />Plot threads are built up, but never pay off.  Many scenes seem pointless and nearly every single one seems over-long.  Also, it appears that every other scene of the film could be titled "Frank Lucas (Denzel) does a gangster thing to shock you."  It's just that.  Furthermore, the scary thing about that is that when I saw this movie in the theatre, the audience cheered every time he shot someone or set someone on fire.  That's more of a fault of our society than the movie, though the latter does seem to glorify Frank Lucas and put him in a very morally ambiguous area.  The fact that most people took scenes that were likely put in to be shocking and disgusting as "cool" left me with a bad taste in my mouth.<br /><br />Again, though... my distaste paled in comparison to my boredom.  Could it have BEEN any longer?<br /><br />I can't believe this dreck was made by the same man behind <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UBMWG4">Blade Runner</a> and, one of my favorite movies, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009ZYBY">Gladiator</a>.  I would never, never watch this again, nor could I recommend it to any serious film fan.<br /><br />2/10</p></body></html>

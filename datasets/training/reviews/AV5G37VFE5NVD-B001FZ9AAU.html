<meta name="summary" content="Not sturdy as steel, but certainly shiny as iron"></head><body><p>Just as Iron Man is the king of Marvel's second-tier comic heroes, Jon Favreu's "Iron Man" rules over the second-tier Marvel film adaptations.  Though not on par with the finest Marvel adaptations, Sam Raimi's "Spider-Man" series and Bryan Singer's "X-Men" films, "Iron Man" rules over all others with an iron fist.  It all rests on the shoulders of Robert Downey Jr., who portrays titular hero Tony Stark with all the reckless ego which so many now associate with Americans.  Stark is a true American hero: he wasn't born with any superpowers, and though he was born into a substantially-wealthy family, it is he who pushes his corporation to its limits and who ultimately goes beyond those limits to become one of the shiniest superheroes.  He's further separated from his peers by the fact that he doesn't live his life in painful rememberance, and thus it's not pain that motivates him to do good.  What does motivate him, probably not even he knows.<br /><br />Like its protagonist, "Iron Man" is not one of the deepest superhero films to hit the screen.  Unlike "Batman Begins" (the sequel to which, July's "The Dark Knight," stands as "Iron Man"'s fiercest competition), "Iron Man" does not delve deep into the psychosis of its hero, opting instead to focus on his struggles as an up-and-coming superhero.  Stark's origins are explored in a gritty fashion not unlike "Batman Begins."  The similarities between Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne further connect the two films, but Favreau's vivid, colorful style ensures that the similarities end there.  Favreau was an interesting choice to direct, given that his past filmography is highlighted by two family films, "Elf" and "Zathura," but he doesn't disappoint.  Stark's non-iron-clad activities mimic the character's lavish lifestyle, while the action sequences may be the sturdiest in any Marvel film.<br /><br />But far more sturdy is Robert Downey Jr.  Like Favreau, Downey was an unlikely choice for the film, but Downey elevates the film to a level it could never have reached led by another actor.  In fact, this is the best thing Downey has ever done.  His dedication to the role and love of the character shines through every one of Stark's smarmy remarks, apparent in every arrogant move he makes.  Downey turns a character who could easily lose the audience's sympathy into a guy one can't help but love.  It's hard not to get excited about Downey's cameo in "The Incredible Hulk," Marvel's next movie, released in mid-June.<br /><br />Though Downey could easily hold the film on his own, he's supported by a delightful cast.  Most delightful is Gwyneth Paltrow, who is as adorable and charming in the role of Stark's gentle secretary Pepper Potts as anyone.  One wishes a character so irresistible and clever as Potts would play a bigger role in the film, but no doubt that'll happen in the sequel.  Similarly likeable is Terrence Howard, who plays Stark's best friend, military pilot Jim Rhodes - and who, as any fan of the comic knows, will wind up as Stark's iron-clad sidekick, War Machine.<br /><br />The most surprising performance comes from Jeff Bridges.  Bridges, perhaps best known as "The Dude" from the Coen brothers' "The Big Lebowski," isn't usually the bad guy.  But that's just what he is in this film, and what a villain he is!  As Stark's partner-turned-archenemy Obadiah Stone, Bridges exhudes a ruthlessness and complete lack of morality not seen in any other cinematic supervillain.  His performance is what Kevin Spacey should have aspired to when he portrayed Lex Luthor in "Superman Returns."  It's a welcome change from the over-the-top behavior most supervillains are so fond of.<br /><br />Superhero films tend to be fond of heavy effects; after all, most of the films require them.  But the effect of the effects tends to be lessened by underdeveloped or overused computer-generated imagery (case in point: the last superhero picture, "Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer").  Not in "Iron Man."  There's the inevitable amount of C.G.I. effects, but the effects have been precisely designed.  They may even surpass the stunning effects from last summer's "Transformers."<br /><br />All this would mean little if the movie was not based upon a decent script.  This script is a fine one indeed, the product of two writing duos (Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, and Art Marcum and Matt Holloway).  It never takes itself too seriously, but just seriously enough, choosing well-timed witticism over self-conscious grandeur (as in "Daredevil" or the last "X-Men" movie).  It also, miraculously, is able to appeal equally to those familiar and those unfamiliar with the comics.  Part of this is the sensible decision to upgrade Tony Stark from a Vietnam-era weapons designer to a military designer for the Iraq War.  But while it appeals to fans and non-fans, it's those familiar with the comic that will enjoy the film the most: it hints at a number of potential storylines for sequels, and even sets up an Avengers movie.<br /><br />"Iron Man" is one of the increasingly rare films which longs for a sequel and which we wish would receive one.  Now that the film has grossed a stunning amount of money at the box office, a release date for "Iron Man 2" has been set for April 30, 2010, and a second sequel is ready as soon as that one's finished.  Bring it on.  "Iron Man" may not be an excellent film like "Spider-Man 2," "Batman Begins," or even the original "Superman," but it's a darn good superhero film.  And if not as sturdy as steel, it is certainly as shiny as iron.</p></body></html>

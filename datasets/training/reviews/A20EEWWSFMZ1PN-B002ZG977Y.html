<meta name="summary" content="Has all the highlights and dialog of a Hallmark movie"></head><body><p>Perseus (Sam Worthington) picked up from the sea by a fisherman, has no idea where he came from or where he is going. He just has distaste for gods, especially one that dispatch his adopted family. Now he is out to even the playing field and put Hades (Ralph Fiennes) down, way down. He has many assistants as Io (Gemma Arterton) and many adventures in the process. Three witches keep an eye on him. Someone may lose his or her head and there is more than one bad person. Will Perseus take Hades (Ralph Fiennes) down a peg or is Perseus doomed. In any event, he must get Kraken.<br /><br />This presentation shows that CGI and 3D do not a film make. It helps to have dialog, pacing and a little better knowledge of antiquity.  As far as CGI is considered, some things can look scary and others like cartoons. This film falls somewhere in the middle but not as bad as it could have been. They only used what was needed to tell their story in today's action packed terms. I saw this movie in the theater for the 3D experience. I wanted to see if it was an improvement over the red and green or red and blue glasses.<br />So far, I will hold judgment. Some 3D can be eye popping and make you duck as it is coming at you. In the case of this movie, it was more like looking through a stereoscope or View Master. The third dimension was behind the front plate. Combining the CGI fast action with the 3D technology created a hairy mess and you had to wait until it was over to guess what happened. In any event, I now have a new set of glasses to add to my collection.<br /><br />I am slightly prejudice because I saw the original Clash and know what the movie could have been. However, it was not as bad as it could have been and has all the earmarks of a Hallmark special. The original film took a few liberties with the story but this version was out of the ballpark. See it once to help appreciate the original.</p></body></html>

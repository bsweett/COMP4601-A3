Razorback is low-budget and cheesy, but it's loads of fun, and Ricochet is watchable, if dated, when I'm in the mood for such things. His music videos, of course, are legendary (he was behind the lens for some of the most popular videos from Duran Duran, Spandau Ballet, and Billy Joel, among others). Something happened, though. Maybe it had to do with him landing Highlander II, one of the silliest movies ever to come down the pike. 'Cause it was after that that things started going to pot pretty quick. The most recent evidence of his slide into eternal celluloid [censored for Amazon consumption] is the third (and, please God, the final) Resident Evil movie, Extinction.<br /><br />I loved the first Resident Evil, and still consider it one of the two or three best movies in the odd, quirky subgenre of the action-flick videogame adaptation. The second wasn't nearly as good, but still had some fun with the franchise and was a movie that was worth watching a second time. This one follows the same formula: put Milla Jovovich in something sexy (in this case, olive drab short-shorts), give her a fair-to-middling-known, but excellent, right-hand star (in this case, Ali Larter of Final Destination), unleash some zombies, throw the Umbrella Corporation in there somewhere, and away you go. It worked in the first two, but you know that Mulcahy and scriptwriter Paul W. S. Anderson (and why he allowed this to happen to his baby is beyond me) decided to take it in a slightly different direction. Kinda. And so the first five minutes plays like a rehash of the action scenes from the first movie. They added a few details to let you know you weren't in an actual flashback, but still. The we get to the actual story, which has Alice (Jovovich) out on her own, having abandoned the group she was with at the end of Apocalypse, and Carlos and L.J. (The Mummy's Oded Fehr and Roll Bounce's Mike Epps) tagging along with a band of survivors led by Claire (Larter). The two bands happen to bump into each other in the desert, where, of course, despite needing to avoid cities because of the ravenous undead, they decide to go try their luck in... Las Vegas!<br /><br />I could forgive that you can see the end of this movie coming five minutes into it. I could forgive the impossibly contrived and painfully linear plot. I could forgive the general stupidity of a storyline that allows almost all of its characters to suddenly disappear with almost a half an hour left in a ninety-five minute movie. (Okay, no I can't, but it sounds good.) I could forgive it all if there were one, just one, good thing about this movie to balance it all out. Larter fills the good-actor-balancing-out-the-rest-of-this-marginal-acting role (filled by Michelle Rodriguez in the first movie and Jared Harris in the second) nicely, but Mulcahy never pushes her, and honestly, she doesn't have enough screen time to really do much. There's just enough character development to make me wonder why there was no character development; even the characters we've seen before come off as gold-leaf-thin. The new ones? Forget it. Even that might be permissible if this movie started with the action and then never let up, but no; the first half of the movie seems to have been set aside to give us some insight into these characters, and we never get any. Mulcahy uses it to move all his pieces into place, and that's exactly how he treats there characters-- as pieces. It really feels like the entire movie were designed around someone saying "hey, wouldn't it be cool to build a set of a ruined Las Vegas?". The worst part is, they never actually take advantage of most of the set, with all the Vegas action taking place in one small area. The entire palette of special effects was lifted from the first movie. The direction is competent, but barely more than that; the same with the cinematography, which stuns me given a desert setting and an Australian director (the Aussies grow some fine cinematographers, especially when working with sere canvasses; Mulcahy, however, brought on UK lensman David Johnson, who does fine work with small, cramped spaces, as he did in the original Resident Evil, but doesn't seem to know what do do with himself once he gets outside).<br /><br />And please, for the love of god. I knew someone would eventually break down and use a cover of "White Rabbit" in one of these movies, but I was hoping it wouldn't happen until after I died. Oh, well. Too late. And it's a bad cover, too. (The impact was only slightly lessened by my seeing a trailer for the upcoming Iron Man movie, which it seems will feature the original Black Sabbath track.)<br /><br />The twenty-first of September, 2007, was a banner day in film, with America seeing, for one of the very few times in the past thirty years, a wide theatrical release of a David Cronenberg film. Me? I got to the theater ten minutes after it started, so I went to see Resident Evil: Extinction instead. I wish I'd saved my money. *</p></body></html>

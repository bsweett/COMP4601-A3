BROOKS AND DANE COOK IN ONE FOR THE BOOKS! 3 3/4 STARS!"></head><body><p>'Mr. Brooks' is an interesting entry in the serial killer genre, but the film is a bit long and seems a little contrived at times. While I found this inside look into the killer's mind engrossing, some scenes seemed out of place and over the top. It's almost like your watching two different movies spliced together. Over all it's a good crime drama if a bit predictable, with a good cast that's a little different than your average serial killer film.</p></body></html>

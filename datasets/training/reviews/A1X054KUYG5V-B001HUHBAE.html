<meta name="summary" content="Overlong and depressingly formulaic"></head><body><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />People say great things about Zodiac but they're apparently talking about a different film than the middling film I saw: after an energetic first half in which the threat of the Zodiac killer keeps the proceedings tense and quick-moving, the film segues into a cliched take on obsession, with all the usual beats in place (even Chloe Sevigny can't do anything with the nagging-wife-who-doesn't-realize-a-man's-gotta-do-what-a-man's-gotta-go role) and a ending that doesn't conclude the film as much as just let it peter out.<br /><br />2.5/4</p></body></html>

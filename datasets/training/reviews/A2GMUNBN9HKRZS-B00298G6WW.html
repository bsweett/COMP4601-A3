Pierce Brosnan is able to cut loose in this film, and creates a wonderfully bizarre character. He comes accross as a combination of conniving lecherous Beetlejuice from that picture, and a burnt out gone to seed third rate Bond. He manages to be repulsive and sympathetic at the same time. It is a great role, and he plays it to the hilt. The scenes shot in Mexico are vibrant and colorful. I would have liked a little more meat to the final job, possibly some more hurdles for the Greg Kinnear character to have to jump, helping Brosnan and cementing his new found confidence in himself. This is an enjoyable romp.</p></body></html>

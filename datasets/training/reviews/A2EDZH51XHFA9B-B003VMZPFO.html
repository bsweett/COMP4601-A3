The problem I'm having with the idea turns on the cultural mindset of America. While I would hesitate to call what we have now "conservative"--let's call it "neocon" instead--there's no denying that the cultural mindset of the seventies was (well, let's not go with "liberal", but say instead "progressive") vastly different than what we have now. That cultural mindset deeply informed such films as The Last House on the Left, The Hills Have Eyes, and The Crazies. We have had remakes of all three recently, and they have varied in their effectiveness, but when you compare the remakes to the originals, there is always a fundamental shift in tone. It is most prominent in The Hills Have Eyes, where the main character has been turned from a geeky wimp with a Sonny Bono mustache whom no one had ever heard of  (Martin Speer, a very good TV actor in one of his few big screen roles; he dropped out of sight entirely in the early nineties) to Aaron Stanford, a guy who's geeky wimpiness at the beginning of the movie is only conveyed to us by his father-in-law calling him (with undisguised contempt) a democrat. When the fur hits the pavement, though, he turns into your typical "rah rah NRA" kinda guy without much trouble. What I'm getting at is that the horror films of the seventies, and these three in particular, may not have taken incisive looks at questions of greater significance, but at least they knew to pose those questions and chew 'em around a little. (One could, of course, tack almost any seventies horror movie with a recent remake onto this, from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre to Dawn of the Dead.) The recent remakes, on the other hand, are content not to question, but simply to reflect. And so we come to the case of The Crazies, the movie whose sole purpose is to resuscitate Breck Eisner's reputation after the horrorshow that was Sahara, one of Hollywood's all-time greatest flops.<br /><br />The movie concerns a small Iowa town where something gets into the water supply and turns the inhabitants into a bunch of, well, crazies. (While they're not zombies, you know Eisner has seen every recent fast-zombie movie, and plays them all to effect here; be warned.) Standing against the not-zombie invasion are the town sheriff (Deadwood's Timothy Olyphant); his wife, the town doctor (Pitch Black's Radha Mitchell); his deputy (Love Happens' Joe Anderson); and her secretary/assistant/something we never really understand (Danielle Panabaker of the recent Friday the 13th remake). They're not exactly handling it well. Enter the military, and if you thought everything was going wrong before...<br /><br />While the military angle existed in the original Romero film, it is an entirely different beast here than it was there. The military are depicted as nothing more than goons, monolithic, indestructible, and for the most part faceless. (We see only two military folks' faces in the film. One is a drone, and the other some sort of high-level functionary, or possibly consultant.) While I'm not entirely sure that sort of thing plays in a time when The Hurt Locker takes Best Picture (which happened about nine hours after I saw this movie), Scott Kosar and Ray Wright, who loosely adapted Romero's 1973 script, are at least willing to give you enough ambiguity in one major scene to leave themselves an out. In any case, it's all very black-and-white; you've got the evil military and you've got the good guys, the local forces. Okay, I take back what I said before; that really is conservative, as opposed to neocon (where the military would have been flag-waving victors who were there to actually help). It's all also very cookie-cutter; you should see the ending coming a mile off if you've seen two or three flicks like this, or read a handful of zombie novels. Or, for that matter, Romero's zombie movies, though he's never been nearly that explicit about it.<br /><br />As for the acting, well. Timothy Olyphant is a very, very good actor who makes very, very bad casting choices; in the past ten years, he's been involved in such ridiculous movies as Stop-Loss, Hitman, Live Free or Die Hard, The Girl Next Door (the Playboy Bunny flick, not the Sylvia Likens movie), Dreamcatcher, A Man Apart, and the Gone in Sixty Seconds remake. This is a better movie than any of those, but he still seems to do better on the small screen than the big (Deadwood and Damages have both been multiple Emmy winners over their runs). Mitchell, on the other hand, is a very, very good actress who makes excellent casting choices and then has the public ignore her movies. Even her foray into the world of Woody Allen, Melinda and Melinda, is probably Allen's least-known venture of the past decade. While she's gotten small roles in movies that got some notice (Finding Neverland, Phone Booth), when she's the marquee name, no one notices (both Pitch Black and Silent Hill were far better films than their gross would suggest, and has anyone in America but me actually seen Visitors, a phenomenal little thriller?). This could be the movie that changes that, since its critical reception has been generally positive. Anderson and Panabaker are not as experienced as the top-billed actors, and it shows. But their characters are both well-acted and likeable, if somewhat overwrought now and again.<br /><br />The hinge for my rating, though, is that The Crazies, which was the tail end of Romero's trilogy of "worst films ever" (the other two, Jack's Wife and There's Always Vanilla, have faded into blessed obscurity in the forty years since their release; they're not at all worth hunting down, no matter how big a Romero fan you are), is kind of like an unmolded lump of modeling clay. It's got a few memorable scenes, but overall, if you were to put together a list of the five worst movies George Romero had ever directed, The Crazies would be on it. (Granted, it would be #5.) It's not classic Romero by any means. Had Eisner tried to remake a Romero movie that was actually good, he probably would have faced the same ire Tom Savini did in 1990, Zack Snyder did in 2004, and Steve Miner did in 2008 (the three directors who remade the original Dead trilogy). Instead, he adapted a minor work, he sharpened it up a bit, and he got a solid stable of actors. This is still a minor film, but it's a pretty good one. Eisner's reputation should lose some of the post-Sahara tarnish. ***</p></body></html>

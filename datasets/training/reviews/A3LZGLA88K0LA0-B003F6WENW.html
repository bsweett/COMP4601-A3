Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are an exceptionally good comic pairing and they make the most of their roles as the titular characters.  They play a couple of DC lawyers who crash weddings in order to meet beautiful girls and they are very successful at it...their manipulations to get into the wedding are innovative and hilarious.  Things change though when they crash the wedding of the daughter of the Treasury Secretary, and find themselves getting too involved with their prey.  Vaughn gets snared by the secretary's sex-crazed youngest daughter and Wilson falls head over heels in love with his other daughter, who just happens to have a hulking jock for a boyfriend.  Not to mention the secretary's alcoholic nympho wife and his artistic and strange son, who may or may not be gay.  The "uncorked" version has 8 1/2 minutes more than the theatrical version, and despite its length, it maintains its level of hilarity and surprisingly enough, a wonderful male friendship without any homoerotic tendencies.  Along with the leads, the supporting cast is great:  Rachel McAdams is perfect as the fetching Claire; Christopher Walken underplays the secretary role; Jane Seymour is a vixenish hussy; Bradley Cooper is a smarmy but charming "Sack".  Cameos from Rebecca Demornay and Dwight Yoakam in the beginning are effective; and Will Ferrell even shows up as Chazz, the "founder" of the wedding crashers.  Only the movie's convoluted and highly improbable ending slightly spoils the overall effect, but what else could happen?  A big box office hit and a funny movie indeed.</p></body></html>

Sin City is also a half-hour too long, brutal, and relentlessly juvenile; and it also sends some strange messages about the kind of violence that one is expected to endure on screen. It's hard to know whom the target audience is for this cinematic piece of pulp - it's certainly not women, the director, Robert Rodriguez certainly makes it obvious how he feels about them, and it's far too graphic for younger teens.<br /><br />The action takes place in a kind of monochromatic, noir black and white universe, with the occasional splash of colour, mostly blood red. In the opening scenes Josh Hartnett appears as a handsome, debonair hit man who approaches a beautiful blond babe. Everything is in cartoonish black and white, except her iconic red dress and blood red lips. They are on a balcony of a penthouse overlooking the crime-ridden hellhole of Basin City. After he quietly shoots the woman, the viewer is transported into three separate tales, each layered over the other, where morally ambiguous heroes take revenge on the scum that fester in mean streets of the City.<br /><br />In the first story, a craggy and weather-beaten Mickey Rourke, unrecognizable under lots of makeup, plays Marv, a brutish street fighter with the ability to dish out and take tremendous punishment (in the form of numerous bullets) and also leap off tall buildings without getting hurt. When Goldie (Jaime King) Marv's beautiful blond hooker is killed, he goes on a rampage to avenge her, which involves beatings, shootings, and various assorted decapitations. In the second story, Clive Owen, complete with foppish hair, is Dwight, a churlish yet polished private investigator trying to protect Old Town's sexily costumed bondage-like hookers, including statuesque ex-girlfriend Gail (Rosario Dawson), after they mistakenly kill a cop (Benicio del Toro). Ironically, the prostitutes turn out to need less protection than Dwight.<br /><br />Both these segments are book ended by washed up sixty-year-old cop Hartigan (Bruce Willis). His last hours of service involve saving an imperiled child from a rapist/killer (Nick Stahl) who is the son of a U.S. senator. He stops the serial killer, castrating him with a shot from his cannon-sized revolver, but the child soon comes back to haunt him eight years later as a stripper (Jessica Alba). She longs to go to bed with him, but at the same time, the hideously deformed killer, has now turned into a foul smelling inhuman beast and is still after her.<br /><br />There are lots of big name actors in peripheral roles including Brittany Murphy as a plucky, disaffected blond waitress and Elijah Wood as a murderous cannibal who eats one victim's surgically removed hand in front of her and mounts his other female victims' heads on his wall. There's the promise of child molestation, cannibalism, electrocution, and copious amounts of severed limbs. None of this is at all particularly offensive as it's heavily stylized and edited, but there's something sinister about a scene where the good guy can get shot in the chest ten times and still live to fight another day. Is the message that bullets will hurt but not kill?<br /><br />There's also something disturbing about a movie that unsophisticatedly portrays women as sexual objects in the form of glamorous whores, and as victims of violence - mere cannibalistic trophies with their severed heads hung on a wall. Sin City's moral dilemmas are bogus and engage no emotional response, and with the corpses gradually piling up, the movie ends up having no sense of fun beyond the filmmakers' twisted self-indulgence. What's more, their efforts to produce some kind of pop culture landmark moment ultimately come at the expense of audience stamina. Most viewers will be thankful when it all ends.

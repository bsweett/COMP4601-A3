<meta name="summary" content="An Absolute Gem; Penguins are the Best"></head><body><p>The work in this film, DVD and the extras really shows; and it's  all high quality.<br /><br />The Film is a simple enough concept, covered well in other reviews. But the packaging of the DVD is a masterpiece. The Menu is entertaining. The Main Commentary is technically enlightening, but not entertaining. The so-called Penguin commentary is actually labelled  Penguin  chat, and should have been feature length; and I REALLY  hope that the Penguins return somehow, since they are the standout gems, and are clearly aimed at an adult viewership.<br /><br />The remaining extras are all  great kids fun. Nothing is really non-family  friendly; in fact this is another film that transcends boundaries in that respect.</p></body></html>

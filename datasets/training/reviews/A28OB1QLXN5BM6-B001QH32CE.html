<meta name="summary" content="Snuggle On The Couch Together Pie"></head><body><p>There is just something about this film, WAITRESS, something indefinable that I can't quite put my finger on.  WAITRESS is a surprisingly delightful film, and my husband and I really enjoyed watching it.  This is definitely a great "snuggle on the couch together" movie.<br /><br />WAITRESS is the story of Jenna, a waitress in a small southern pie shop in a small southern town.  Jenna invents and bakes delicious, original pies (for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert), all with crazy names, like I Hate My Husband Pie, Earl Murders Me Because I'm Having An Affair Pie, Marshmallow Mermaid Pie (invented when she was 10), Bad Baby Pie, and Falling in Love Pie, all which reflect what is happening in her life at that moment.  Jenna is unhappy in her marriage to her abusive husband Earl, and has discovered she's pregnant. Things get complicated and heated and even funny when she falls for her new doctor and he falls for her.<br /><br />WAITRESS is charming and poignant; it runs a gamut of emotions.  It is a relaxed, lazy film that slowly unfolds as layers of taste, texture, and intrigue are added.  Kerry Russell shines as Jenna, breathing life and love into the character.  Nathan Fillion is enchanting as Dr. Pomatter, her quirky, loveable doctor, bringing more than his typical charming self to this role.  The other cast members, including writer-director Adrienne Shelly, bring realism and warmth to WAITRESS.  And the cherry on the top of this scrumptious pie is Andy Griffith as Joe, the curmudgeonly owner of the pie shop, who grudgingly dispenses advice, wisdom, and poetry, but is really an old cream puff deep down.  Joe has a true affection and respect for Jenna, and he does what he can to help her overcome her lot in life.<br /><br />Sweet, fun, touching, and vibrant, WAITRESS is an unexpected movie that draws the audience in from beginning to end.  You care about these characters and want what is best for them.  And what is best may surprise you.  WAITRESS is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</p></body></html>

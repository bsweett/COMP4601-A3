<meta name="summary" content="A Good Action Movie!!!"></head><body><p>If you don't like violence, then, this movie is not for you. Man on Fire is one of those rare movies that takes you deep into the characters and their inner beings. Denzel shows a stunning performance as John W. Creasy, a heavy drinker in need of employment. The bond he has with "Pita", Dakota Fanning's character is almost magical. It's hard to talk about the movie without giving it away, but all I can say is, it's the best action movie I've seen in a long while. The movie seemed confusing at times due to the cinematography. You can't go to sleep on this one or you'll surely miss something important. There are subtitles throughout even when the characters are speaking English. But, even that concept was quite fascinating. This movie is Action, Drama, and Comedy all rolled into one. For all those Denzel fans, it's all you would expect him to be and then some. Great movie.</p></body></html>

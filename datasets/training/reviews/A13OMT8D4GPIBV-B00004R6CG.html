<meta name="summary" content="Hitchcock's Masterpiece"></head><body><p>Alfred Hitchcock created one of the greatest films in 1958.  Vertigo is a film that not many people will get upon first viewing.  In actuality, it took me a second look just to understand what I just saw.<br /><br />The film is filled to the brim with story.  One of the most complex and yet simple stories of all time.  This is a film that you need your undivided attention to realize just how powerful it is, without any outside interference.<br /><br />It's a movie that even the smallest hint of plot would give it away.  The only thing and best thing to describe it is, a former police officer suffering from Vertigo is paid to watch a rich man's wife.<br /><br />Another thing about Vertigo that makes me love this movie is its absolutely gorgeous look.  One of the most beautifully shot movies of all time.<br /><br />It's one of my all time favorite movies, and one of the best EVER, in the history of cinema.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />The DVD features, as already discussed her on Amazon, feature a commentary track with the producers and restoration team, and a documentary on the making of Vertigo.</p></body></html>

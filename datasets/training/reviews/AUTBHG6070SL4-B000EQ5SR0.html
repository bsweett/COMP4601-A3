<meta name="summary" content="Great-looking action flick"></head><body><p>If you're suspicious of a shoot-em-up SF action flick by a female director, don't be. This one is as fast and as furious as any other around. And it's better looking than most, and it makes better use of the female leads.<br /><br />There's some kind of a plot to this movie, if you pay attention to such things: some far future place, the last enclave of mankind. A terrible plague nearly wiped out humanity, and an equally terrible cure nearly finished the job by sterilizing the survivors. Society sustains itself by recycling DNA - cloning people, and maintaining the population by replacement as the old copies die. There may, however, be a cure for the cure, a way to reverse the sterility and restart the genetic Mixmaster. A power struggle ensues, with the tyrants who like being themselves again and again trying to quash the discovery.<br /><br />Enter Aeon, codename for the super-assassin-babe (Charlize Theron). She'll take out an armed and armored platoon bare handed and never muss a single spike of her sabertooth bangs. That's about it, really, lots of running around and go-boom, with pretty women. Pretty women with their clothes on, if it matters to you. One thing that sets it apart from others in its class, like The 'Matrix', is the pace of action. Where 'The Matrix' alternated set-piece action sequences and breathing space, this one sustains the energy level better. Maybe it doesn't peak as high, but it keeps a thundering pace. And, according to the extras, Theron and the other leads did nearly all their own stunts. If there's one thing cooler than a hot babe, it's a hot babe who can do stuff.<br /><br />The locations deserve special mention. They're convincingly futuristic, which makes a pretty disappointing statement about our sense of the future. All those high tech, way cool pieces of architecture actually exist and have mundane use: an animal shelter, an urban water supply, a crematorium, or a wind tunnel dating back half a hundred years. The coolest location, the one I was sure had to be sound-stage carpentry, was an 18th century church. What can I say? The future just isn't what it used to be.<br /><br />It has great action, a great look, and great female leads. If you have a fourteen year old boy anywhere in your spirit, let it see this movie. (And no, you don't have to be male to have a fourteen year old boy somewhere inside.)<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

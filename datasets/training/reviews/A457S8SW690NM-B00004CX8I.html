His performance is in my opinion one of the best ever. Sydney Lassick delivers also an extraordinary performance as Charlie Cheswick. On the other hand, I didn't find Louise Fletcher to do that good of a job. I found her performance to be way overrated and found it to be fairly descent but definitely not worthy of best actress.<br /><br />Now to the movie. Beware if you are sensitive, the movie is very sad and depressing. You'll probably cry at the awful treatment that you see. I found myself cussing at the TV and screaming at nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher). I mean, I hated her. I was screaming at her nonstop. She was so awful to everyone. This mental institution is so awful that it is probably making everyone there a lot more crazy than they were. Jack Nicholson is McMurphy, a guy who fakes insanity to get out of prison. He is therefore sent to a mental institution. There, he is the leader. He befriends everyone and is their leader. They love him and he loves them. But, Nurse Ratched and her goons stand in his way to freedom and won't even let them watch the world series. The movie is very sad and touching and the ending is at first terribly depressing and then there is a joyous occasion. The electroshocking of the patients is awful and made me feel like wanting to strike back against this. You'll hate the goons and that stupid nurse Ratched. The movie is haunting and I was so into it that I would be cheering for the patients, laughing with them, crying with them, and hurling insults at nurse Ratched. I was so into it that I'd be like: "You stupid bit**!!! Just let them watch the World Seires! Come on!" I got very emotionally into it and connected with all of the patients. This movie is a haunting journey and the treatment in this institution is criminal and is making all of the patients insane or more insane than they were. This is an excellent movie that is worthy of any serious collection and is in my opinion Jack Nicholson's best movie and his finest performance.</p></body></html>

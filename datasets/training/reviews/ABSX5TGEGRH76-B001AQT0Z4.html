<meta name="summary" content="Good, Yet Little Replay Value"></head><body><p>Well, I've finally seen Pulp Fiction.  After weeks of being asked to see it by a friend of mine, I finally sat down and watched it.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the movie, although I'm not sure how anyone can watch this more than once.<br /><br />There really isn't "a" story; it's more about a group of people who's lives intersect through a mob boss named Marcellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) in four short stories.  While most of the characters overlap into different stories, there is usually one or two core characters in each tale.  One of the stories is about two robbers (played by Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer) who plan on holding up a diner.  John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson play hit men working for Wallace who screw up a job.  Later, Travolta's character Vincent Vega (brother of Michael Madsen's Vic Vega in Resevoir Dogs) has to take out Wallace's wife Mia (Uma Thurman) when Wallace is out of town.  Then, there is a bit about Bruce Willis as Butch Coolidge, a down-and-out boxer who is going to take a fall in his last fight.<br /><br />The way the stories are told is done very well; things are not completely chronologically, which leads viewers to wonder how different characters got into certain situations.<br /><br />Now, about what I was saying earlier.  This is a really good movie, but its replay value is severely limited.  This is definitely a movie that can only be fully enjoyed once by most people (people who are die-hard Tarantino fans will probably be the ones doing multiple viewings).  But don't let that comment stop you from checking it out at least once, as you'd be doing yourself a disservice.</p></body></html>

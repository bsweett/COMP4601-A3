He decides that he will take a gamble and go without a salary for 6 months in order to be an intern at Dean Whitter and compete for one job with 19 other interns.  Things go from bad to worse, but through it all Gardner is a faithful father to his son and he does the best he can to raise him and train to be a stock broker at the same time.  Real-life father and son Will and Jaden Smith are well-cast as the inspirational Chris and Christopher Gardner.  There is an extra feature in which Chris Gardner is interviewed and he is shown going through an emotional time of reliving the difficulties of his life during the early 80's, when this movie takes place.  It is an inspiration to see what can be accomplished when a man stays true to his family values and refuses to give up his dream.</p></body></html>

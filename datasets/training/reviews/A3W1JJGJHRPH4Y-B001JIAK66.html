<meta name="summary" content="Not a horror movie"></head><body><p>This movie reminded me of the Abbot and Costello monster movies. Every monster, except for "The Invisible Man," was in this movie just for the fun of it, just like the Abbot and Costello movies.  The movie had its good points. First, the movie had a lot of energy. Second, Hugh Jackman as Van Helsing was very good.  The special effects were good. The sets were terrific. I liked the Frankenstein monster. He was the only intelligent character in the movie.<br /><br />On the minus side, Dracula was not very scary. The plot was very stupid, but then it wasn't directed toward adults, I suppose. Of course, my kids would have torn the movie apart for its internal inconsistencies. I grew up watching monster movies so I am more forgiving. The special effects tended to defy physics and logic at every conceivable opportunity. There was a lot of swinging from cables and ropes for impossible distances. The movie redefined the vampire legend without explaining why. For example, silver stakes were substituted for wooden stakes, I think. Vampires can sexually reproduce, somehow, I think. It wasn't really clear to me what was going on. There are some plot points that absolutely insulted my intelligence or the intelligence of the vampires.<br /><br />Keep your expectations very low and the movie was okay. By all means, rent and not buy. I can't see any reason to see this movie twice.</p></body></html>

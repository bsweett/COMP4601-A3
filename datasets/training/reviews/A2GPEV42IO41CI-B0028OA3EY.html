<meta name="summary" content="If you like action flicks, you'll like this one"></head><body><p>After a five-year absence, Superman (Brandon Routh) returns to Metropolis and finds Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) now has a child and a boyfriend, and archenemy Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey) is up to no good again.  Lex wants own the world and starts creating a new continent; Lois is on his trail, and Superman is after her.<br /><br />Brandon Routh is very good as Superman, mainly because he looks a lot like Christopher Reeve.  He's a beautiful man and does a fine job, especially as Clark Kent.  Unfortunately, he's given little dialogue.  I thought Bosworth and Spacey were both miscast.  His gloomy Luthor is also a man of (too) few words, and he's lethargic and boring to boot.  Bosworth looks like a glamorous 20-year old model and lacks the wonderful awkwardness that made Margot Kidder's Lois so endearing.  Even boy photographer Jimmy Olson and editor Perry White look wrong.  They should provide a little humor, but are bland and forgettable instead.  The film has so much computer-animation that nothing feels real.  There is no romance or sense of danger.  If you like non-stop action on a grand scale, you'll enjoy this movie, but if you're looking for memorable characters that are developed and ring true, you'll be disappointed.</p></body></html>

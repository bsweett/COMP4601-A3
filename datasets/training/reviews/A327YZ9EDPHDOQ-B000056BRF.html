<meta name="summary" content="Ben Hur at 50 still nifty!"></head><body><p>Recently I have been watching some movies that were big in the year I was born...1959. This one is definitely in the top 10! A story of redemption, betrayal,anger and oh yes,a chariot race! Charlton Heston was first rate in this classic William Wyler movie. 212 minutes of classic cinema. After 50 years Ben Hur has stood as a monument to great movie making! Bravo! :)</p></body></html>

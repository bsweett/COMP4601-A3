<meta name="summary" content="Love John Wayne"></head><body><p>This movie is when John Wayne was older. He owns a small cattle ranch and it is coming time to take them to market. All the ranch hands split to take advantage of the newest wave of gold fever. He is left without any help to find his stock to their destination. He visits a school on the suggestion of the local town bartender and decides to hire on some pretty talented young pupils to run the steer on the drive. They find themselves in some adventures and sad happenings along the way. The cook is a great character to watch and the way he dialogs to the others is like prose. It is cowboys and toughness with imagination. The things I liked were the cattle drive, I liked John Wayne's strength and his boundary setting, I loved the cooking that came from his wife and his excellent cook, I would love to go on a drive and have the best food south of the border, I love the idea of having bacon, biscuits and stewed apples, I love the cabbage and beans, etc., I loved the lay of the land, the quiet peace, the horseback riding, I loved the fairy tale way the cook dealt with the boys, I loved the simplicity of life, and I loved the little ranch house in the middle of only land that meets the eye with people who come not in droves but in small amounts where intimacy can happen if so desired.</p></body></html>

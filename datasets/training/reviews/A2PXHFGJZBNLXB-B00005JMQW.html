<meta name="summary" content="A modern superhero genre classic, and deeper than the first"></head><body><p>SPIDERMAN continues the Spiderman saga as Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) tries to juggle his responsibilities as a superhero and as a student at Columbia University trying to pay his rent and attend his classes. Things are not easy, to say the least---especially when a new villain arrives, in the form of Doc Ock (Alfred Molina), endowed with four cyber-intelligent tentacles that force him to continue with experiments that could put Manhattan in mortal danger. And of course Peter still has a crush on Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), and friend Harry Osborn (James Franco) still has a vendetta against Spiderman for the murder of his father.<br /><br />Peter Parker feels the great burden of his responsibilities, and the ways in which he tries to deal with it is part of what makes SPIDERMAN a worthy sequel to the 2001 original. SPIDERMAN was a good genre film because, through all the special effects and action scenes, director Sam Raimi never lost track of the human element, never allowed the film to sink into a brainless action spectacle. Peter Parker the character is fully given his due, and there is a wonderful authenticity to the film's emotions-nothing artificially heightened or manipulative. SPIDERMAN 2 is emotionally richer than the original, and that is quite an accomplishment for a sequel. Even better, the special effects are slightly more convincing than they were in the first film, and there are some bravura action scenes---particularly one in which Spiderman has to use all his power to stop a moving train---that equal the best of any superhero epic.<br /><br />One would be hard-pressed to think of anyone else that could have played Spiderman as convincingly as Tobey Maguire does in both films. He never expresses emotions through attention-grabbing gestures, but always stays in character beautifully. The other performances are good, but Maguire helps take the film to a higher level. SPIDERMAN 2 is a great sequel, a worthy superhero movie, and terrific entertainment. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

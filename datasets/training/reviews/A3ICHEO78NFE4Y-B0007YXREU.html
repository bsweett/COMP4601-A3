<meta name="summary" content="Whatever Happened to Talent?!?!?!"></head><body><p>Is there anyone left in Hollywood that isn't on drugs, has one married affair after another, or have any morals left like Paris Hilton that can make a movie?  I'm beginning to think with all the earthquakes in California maybe the best thing is to have a huge one where the entire State of California will just fall into the ocean.  Then and maybe then will someone of talent make movies that are enjoyable to everyone.  Right now there is no more talent in Hollywood, nither actors, producers or directors.  This film made me feel embarrased that the rest of the world sees what little talent we have in america.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Brian De Palma's SCARFACE"></head><body><p>This is probably De Palma's best film and one of Al Pacino's best as well. Maybe he was better in the Godfather, but Scarface was more entertaining to watch. The film was a departure for De Palma, who tends to film Hitchcock type films, until now, like Dressed to Kill and Blow Out.</p></body></html>

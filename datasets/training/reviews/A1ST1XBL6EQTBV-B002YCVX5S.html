<meta name="summary" content="I Enjoyed This Movie, But It's Not For Everyone!"></head><body><p>When this film came out earlier this year,<br />I figured Quentin Tarrantino, Brad Pitt...should be good!<br />To me it was, with the exception of some of the<br />scenes which could've been cut shorter and their points<br />would have still been made.<br />But other than that, I loved it!<br />I went with two of my freinds and one of them acted<br />like the graphic violence was just too much for her<br />delicate sensibilities, and I thought to myself<br />"DUH!-It's Quentin Tarrantino!, i.e. Reservoir Dogs?<br />--Pulp Fiction?--From Dusk Til' Dawn?---Kill Bill 1 & 2?--<br />I think everyone knows by now that graphic violence<br />is a given when you see his movies!"<br /><br />My other freind, a guy, found it just to be<br />"just okay", so see there you go...it's not a film<br />for everybody, but I found it to rank right up there<br />with Tarrantino's better work as a director.<br />As for Brad Pitt, I'm very bias when it comes to him...<br />I just think he and Johnny Depp can do no wrong in<br />anything that they play in!  (-:<br />But putting that aside and trying to be as analytical<br />as I can be for the sake of this review, I really found<br />his character to be quite believable as the ringleader of<br />a bunch of nazi-killing renegade soliders in WW2 who<br />suffer no fools and take no prisoners!<br />Eli Roth, the director of a lot of modern-day horror<br />fare was just that...HORRIFYING in his role as the<br />baseball bat-swinging, nazi-hating psycho "BEAR JEW"<br />who Brad's character refers to as THE REAPER!!<br />Brad effects his Missouri/Oklahoma southern accent<br />for this role, even though the character says he hails<br />from Tennessee!---But most people can't detect the difference.<br />Of course, being a QT film, there are plenty of sub plots<br />and plot twists all interwoven throughout, as well as<br />his trademark dark humor, culminating in an explosive ending.<br />So to those of you who haven't already seen it,<br />I'd say rent it first before buying it just to see if<br />it's your cup of tea. But I say it's a 4 star film for<br />sure, subtracting a point for the extra long scenes<br />that I mentioned earlier.<br />I have the 2-Disc version because there are some<br />great extras and deleted scenes that were cut,<br />but probably could've stayed to explain certain details,<br />like what's the backstory on Brad's character,<br />and how did he get those rope burn scars around his neck?  (HMMMMMM!!)</p></body></html>

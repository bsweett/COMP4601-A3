<meta name="summary" content="The first war movie that made me laugh hysterically!"></head><body><p>This movie is so thick with sugary, gooey and contrived sentiment you'll wish the dentist was sitting right next to you to clean your teeth when it's all over.  There is not one thing they "got right" with this movie.  When I see movies like Platoon, Full Metal Jacket and Hamburger Hill, I am reminded of what great filmmaking involving the Vietnam War can be.  For an author to outright say Hollywood has never produced one film about the Vietnam War with ultimate correctness, I am appalled by the accusation since those last three films I just mentioned have gone on to be some of the most powerful and gripping films of our time-not to mention of the Vietnam War!  After watching "We were soldiers," the directors and writers use every cliche in the book (including cliches innovated from those three films) to tell a story that has been told a million times before and with far better innovation than this tripe of a film!  <p>Let me say this without reservation;  I am in the US Navy and quite simply, watching something like this angers me because it tries too hard to convey a message without taking the really hard roads to tell it.  It's almost presented with too much ease and not enough grit and grime.  I will say, there is one scene where the grit and grime come really close-when Barry Peppers character tries to lift one of his buddies to safety only to accidently pull off charred legs from Nepalm-it's gripping and shocking and the look on Barry Peppers face is brilliant.  Barry Pepper is a really great actor and quite frankly he really holds up a really small and strong character throughout the film.  Unfortunately, I quickly ended up breaking in laughter watching bacon boy look ridiculous with all the obvious layers of make up that was supposed to look like a charred face.  <p>After watching the "making of" documentary on the DVD, my assumptions were correct when they show you a plethora of wardrobe for Mr. Gibson who wore dozens of different uniforms to show the wear and tear of the event.  C'MON!  Why not just have Mel Gibson in one uniform for the entire thing?  Do you see what Hollywood is trying to do here folks?  It's not reality and it's not realistic, it's just a bunch of guys in front of a camera playing war games only with a bunch of caterers standing by and slick and expensive production designl. Even worse, no heartfelt emotion anywhere!<p>The DVD itself poses almost no extras (not even a trailer) and is a letdown considering this movie was a major upset and only raked in a measly 60 million at the box office.  This movie cost almost twice that and I don't see them really making up the cost anywhere on this DVD version.  I am kinda glad this movie didn't go too far.  It doesn't deserve to.  After watching brilliant war films like Saving Private Ryan (depicting WW2) and Black Hawk Down (Gulf War), you know that the story of Vietnam has been appropriately done somewhere else after watching "We Were Soldiers."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="NOT THE ALICE YOU MIGHT RECALL"></head><body><p>You'd think by all the negative reviews that everyone expected Tim Burton, of all creative people, to follow the book ( ALICE IN WONDERLAND ) in reverential lockstep. It is pretty apparent from the opening scenes that this will not be the case ( and, personally speaking, I would have been disappointed had he chosen to do so ). I do agree that the plot was a bit plodding at times, and on more than a few occasions it seemed as though both the cast and crew had wandered into LSD-land, but there was some good dialogue, and fun takes on classic characters ( Alan Rickman's Caterpillar, Helena Bonham Carter's Red Queen, and especially Stephen Fry's wonderful Cheshire Cat ), and despite some false steps, the casting of Mia Wasikowska as a grown up version of Carroll's heroine was inspired.<br /><br />It isn't Burton's, or Depp's finest work, but it is quite watchable, and I did not find the CGI to be anywhere near as reprehensible as some seemed to believe it was.</p></body></html>

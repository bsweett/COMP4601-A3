<meta name="summary" content="Stylish and intelligent movie (plus Easter Egg info)"></head><body><p>"V for Vendetta" has become among my favorite films of all time. Finally, a major Hollywood production that's intelligent and whose main focus is the story and not the special effects (usually it's the other way around with this genre). V is the most interesting, mysterious and complex character I've seen in a movie in quite some time, even if we sometimes question his actions. Everything about this movie works IMO. It's stylish, well-acted, dark, intriguing and intelligent. Forget politics - this is a fine piece of filmmaking.<br /><br />And what a great DVD release, with a flawless transfer. I highly recommend investing the extra $ and getting the 2-disc edition. The section on the history of Guy Fawkes is worth the price of admission. And here's how to access the "Saturday Night Live Digital Short" Easter Egg:<br /><br />Play the second disc. Click on "More" at the bottom to go to the second screen that features the "Cat Power Montage" option. Place the "V" cursor on the "Cat Power Montage" option and press Up. If done correctly, the image of the pair of wings at the top will turn black. Now place the cursor on the wings and press Enter to see a side of Natalie Portman you never thought you would!</p></body></html>

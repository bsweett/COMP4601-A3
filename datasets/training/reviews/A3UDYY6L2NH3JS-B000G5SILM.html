<meta name="summary" content="The fuzzy limit between propaganda and political fiction"></head><body><p>An unimaginable film that does not even give any logical explanation to anything happening on the screen. They revive the KGB to go back to the good old cold war model, but move them to Kazakhstan. Is it because the Kazakhs have built a pipeline to sell their oil to China instead of building a pipeline across Afghanistan and Iran and Irak to sell their oil to the US ? The president ot the USA is the most wanted president in the world at least by would-be terrorists and assassins. It is true that a fair number of US presidents have been assassinated or assaulted. But hasn't it always been by Americans, and even in this case it is said to be impossible without an American mole inside the secret services ? Forget it, man, the second cold war has just been declared by Hollywood. Of course the US president gets out of it unscathed. But the film becomes ridiculous when it states a sexual affair between the oldest of the security agents and the First Lady. Both ridiculous and absurd, including pictures of the sexual meeting between the two inside the First Lady's bedroom. That is really more than a mole. Why are our western countries suddenly so obsessed by heads of states and political fiction (three films and one TV series that I know of over the last three months, and I am not in the know of everything) ? Hollywood, and other western producers, would be very much inspired if they tried to take some distance from their political object if not objective. It sounds and smells too much like propaganda.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</p></body></html>

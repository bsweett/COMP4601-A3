<meta name="summary" content="One of the best films ever made"></head><body><p>Sometimes hilarious, sometimes somber and always tragic, this is the highly entertaining dramatized story of Mozart. A fictional story about the tragic life of a real-life genius. It is a fact that Wolfgang Amadeus  Mozart died a pauper in an un-marked mass grave, but no one knows if he  even knew Antonio Salieri much less had such profound interactions with  him. As composers of note, they definitely were aware of each other's  existence at the time, but the fictionalized tale here should not be  watched as though it is historical fact.<p>The wardrobes, backdrops and  everything you see in this film are breathtakingly accurate and believable.  The acting is flawless by every single person you see on screen, whether  it's the un-credited extra in the background or the main characters  themselves.<p>The music is incredible and you'll never hear these pieces  the same after you see them being performed on screen.<p>I wish the DVD had  included more extras, perhaps some clips of the Oscars when Abraham won for  best actor and interviews with the cast and crew. A behind the scenes  featurette would have also been wonderful. Nonetheless, this is one of the  top films ever made and a must-see for anyone who loves good film and  superb acting that will blow you away.</p></body></html>

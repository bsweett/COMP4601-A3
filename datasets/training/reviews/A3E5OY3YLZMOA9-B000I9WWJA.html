<meta name="summary" content="Where's This Inside Man"></head><body><p>Inside Man is nothing without this amazing cast and without Denzel Washington leading them off it would have been ugly. Without the cast the movie is a bit predictable so it's no wonder why Denzel and Clive were in this one.  Inside Man is about a bank robbery, then the rich man that owns the bank needs to get in there to get something that he wants to keep secret, this is a story that so far has low interest in it cause if someone like Peter Richards or Mike Justice were the leading actors no one would care about this movie. It gets better though when the plot thickens cause you don't exactly know what Clive and his buddies are there for, they don't want money. The tactics the robbers are using have never been seen before, like dressing all the hostages up in the same exact clothes as the robbers so the cops don't know who's who.<br /><br />So now you've got a raging Denzel who has to find a way to save more hostages especially when he sees one killed on camera and calm, cool, and relaxed Clive because he has everyone in the palm of his hands. The end of this movie isn't shocking but it's pretty darn good and it actually helps everyone get what they want. There's not much to say about Inside Man except amazing directing by Spike, amazing acting from everybody and a job well done on taking a mediocre script and turning it into something more.</p></body></html>

To properly appreciate Alien3 you should not have seen the original. It would seem that anyone except me who sees Alien and Aliens before this film is destined to make unfavourable comparisons. Sadly, to properly appreciate Alien3 it is also necessary to have seen its predecessors! The paradox leaves us with the sad result that this film, which is pretty good if taken on its own terms is almost always written off as a faded photocopy of Alien. This is unfair. David Fincher, a first time director understands what makes the Alien frightening, and using dark lighting and occasional glimpses of the monster weaves a claustrophobic spell on his audience. The film also has the benefit of a great cast, featuring Paul McGann (Later an effective Doctor in Doctor Who), Tetley Tea man Brian Glover (who wins the award here for the most effective use of a four-letter word in cinema history), Charles Dance, and of course Sigourney Weaver. She has never looked better than with her shaven head, and puts in a performance at least as good as in the first two movies. The script and direction keep us on our toes, and the ending is very satisfying, bringing the trilogy to a worthy conclusion.</p></body></html>

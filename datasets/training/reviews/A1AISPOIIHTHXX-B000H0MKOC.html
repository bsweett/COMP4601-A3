Sure I had a couple but they never once became an addiction. Ironically there are people out there whose sole job it is is to get people to smoke. Criticized for having no moral compass, they basically smooth talk their way into media's hearts by saying the wrong words the right way. As Aaron Eckhart's character says, if you argue correctly, you're never wrong. That is the basic for this film: nobody is really right or wrong, it's just a question of who sounds the most convincing.<br /><br />Eckhart plays Nick Naylor, a lobbyist for the Academy of Tobacco Studies whose basic job is to downplay the dangers of tobacco and smoking and turn things around in their favor. He doesn't necessarily lie, he just makes the truth sound so cool. But when politicians want to put a more grim warning label on cigarettes, Naylor is called into action but a reporter has that come crashing down and he has to once again, talk his way out of rough waters.<br /><br />A film like this usually rests on one actor, unlike most where it's an ensemble film. Eckhart is one of those kind of actors that he's so good when he's actually given a good part to play although roles in Paycheck and the Core were at least watchable but here he kind of flexes his muscles. The rest of the cast is great as well with funny cameos from Adam Brody of the O.C, Rob Lowe, Sam Elliot as the Marlboro Man. The only thing about some of the cast members is that they do feel like cameos with Naylor's ex dating a doctor that practically appears in 2 scenes and Katie Holmes as the reporter just feels miscast (someone like Rachel McAdams would've been perfect).<br /><br />What's enjoyable about the film is that not only is it funny (one favorite is the senator who wants to eliminate all incidents of cigarettes from movies, complete with hilarious alternatives) but it never really feels like an anti-smoking ad in the guise of a film. It argues its pro-smoking points just as well as its anti-smoking ones and leaves it to the viewer to figure out who seems better to you. If its got any faults is that when we start to learn more about Nick the man and not Nick the silver-tongued man on a mission, it doesn't really have the energy when the film ramps up in satire.<br /><br />I'm not sure if you'll end up buying this, but it's a great rental and up to you whether to completely go ahead and buy it. Which isn't a bad thing since it's so funny.</p></body></html>

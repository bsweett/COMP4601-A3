Christopher Reeve, Fine Actor, Exemplum Of Courage"></head><body><p>We will miss you, Christopher Reeve, and we will mourn your passing as we would any other noble soul's.  We loved you as Superman, you were perhaps the only actor we would have "bought" in the role, both as dweeby Clark Kent and the chisel-chinned "Man of Steel," and your floating over Metropolis taught us all that if we found the right love we too could fly.  You won America's heart playing the part with all the conviction and vulnerability in the world, and so when your riding accident happened we were there for you too and we cheered on your fight against immobility and pain.<br /><br />You fought against government inertia and inaction, and you made ordinary people aware of the great divide between the able-bodied and the disabled, a divide that doesn't have to exist.  In some ways you were even more splendid a hero in your later years than when you were mightier than a speeding bullet.  Losing you is an event we were none of us prepared for, because I think we were all expecting one day to see you walk again, so titanic were your reserves of heroism and courage.  Alas, that day was not to be, but now you are in the hall of the Valkyries, flying high overhead with the other heroes we have loved and lost.  Sail on, sail on, Superman!</p></body></html>

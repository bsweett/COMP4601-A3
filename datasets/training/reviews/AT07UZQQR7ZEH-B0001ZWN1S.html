They say it is too long  (it really isn't) and much too violent (it is).  Ironically, the graphic violence may be one reason we have the version of THE GODFATHER that gangster film devotees love so much.  Listen to the illuminating commentary by Coppola on the DVD.  He was young and constantly under pressure from Paramount executives to shoot the movie faster and make it more violent, or face firing.  The exquisite wedding sequence in reel one is a good example--executives demanded it be filmed in three days or else, so scenes with Al Pacino and Diane Keaton talking at a side table were shot at night with tons of light to look like daytime and to cinematographer Gordon Willis' justified anger as a perfectionist.  And a later scene with Talia Shire getting beaten up by her husband was shot by Coppola with the fear of being replaced if he did not add more violence to the movie.<br /><br />It was a low-budget film ($2.5 million) that blossomed up to $6.5 million.  The Hollywood exterior scenes with John Marley were done with long shot doubles and a second unit crew.  (But the infamous horse's head in bed scene WAS done by Coppola in New York.)  Ironically, the first week of filming went very smoothly and included two full nights to film the killing of the violent police captain (Sterling Hayden) and his henchman in the restaurant.  In any event, the first GODFATHER film was a very hard movie to make.  Producer Robert Evans, coming off LOVE STORY, even wanted to replace Nino Rota's incomparably lovely score with something more schmaltzy, until an enthusiastic public screening of the movie convinced him to stay with Rota.<br /><br />At 175 minutes, THE GODFATHER a towering gangster film achievement with flawless performances and solid writing.  (The studio executives were so brutal to Marlon Brando in his Oscar-winning role that he refused to come back for the 1974 sequel, even for just a cameo.  And the "shirts" also were not very keen on Al Pacino as Michael, not even after the restaurant massacre in week one.)  Note the plotting and the way light and dark contrast--not just dramatically, but also visually.  Take the opening reel and the way undertaker Bonasera is talking to Vito Corleone (Brando, and an improvised cat to stroke as he talked) in a darkened study, all golds and browns, while a gorgeous sun-lit wedding reception for Vito's daughter is taking place outside.  The whole movie has juxtapositions like this to make it a special gangster film.  All the way to the last reel, where the baptism of Michael's infant son (really baby Sofia Coppola!) in a cathedral is intercut with terrible murders happening all over greater New York City.<br /><br />Dean Tavoularis' production design and Anna Hill Johnstone's costumes deserve special mention in their extraordinary detail, especially the shops in Little Italy and just the right clothes for everyone on the sidewalks and in the streets.  Their work is magnificent.<br /><br />And I love the Sicily scenes with Al Pacino's Michael hiding out for a couple of years after killing the police captain in the New York restaurant.  Michael falls in love with and marries a beautiful Sicilian bride, with Nino Rota's exquisite "Love Theme" music on the soundtrack.  Their evocative wedding will contrast against the bride being subsequently blown up in a car, which sends Michael back home to Diane Keaton's nurturing Kay.<br /><br />I also love a later scene that a moron Paramount executive wanted cut out because it allegedly did not advance the plot--the death of Brando's Vito Corleone of a heart attack while playing in a tomato vineyard with his young son.  Fortunately, this classic scene stayed in and adds great beauty on either side of darker scenes.  In fact, Coppola says on the audio commentary that Robert Evans eventually came to his rescue when Evans saw that he had a potential masterpiece and blockbuster on his hands--Evans insisted that scene after scene be put back into a movie that was originally about two hours and slowly creeped up to its present 175 minutes.  Hollywood moviemaking is a crapshoot and a crazy, stressful game.  God must have been looking down on the 30 year old director and co-writer more than a few times.<br /><br />In the final analysis, it is the constant blending of romance and violence, both dramatically and visually, that makes THE GODFATHER such a special gangster film masterpiece.  It blends flawless acting, strong writing, authoritative direction, world-class sets and costumes, magnificent (and very underrated) photography, and the loveliest of lovely music scores to be one of the great works of art of the American cinema.  Now if only I could get my own family to watch my DVD of it and its even better 1974 sequel!</p></body></html>

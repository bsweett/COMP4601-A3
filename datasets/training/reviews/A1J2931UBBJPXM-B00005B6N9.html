<meta name="summary" content="Good Presentation Makes It Work"></head><body><p>This film may not expand the Science Fiction Cinematic Universe as we know it, but there's a couple of twists and turns and enough atmosphere to make it a worthwhile addition to the genre.  "Pitch Black," directed by David N. Twohy, involves a commercial space flight carrying forty passengers that crash lands on an unknown desert planet.  With three suns above them, there is plenty of daylight in which the survivors can negotiate their quest for survival, and finding water is their main concern.  As they begin to explore the wastelands for sustenance, they find evidence that others have been there, apparently some years before them:  A small ship and a couple of buildings; all of which appears to have been abruptly left behind.  Lead by pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell), the small band of survivors have a couple of additional obstacles in their way, as well.  One is Riddick (Vin Diesel), a murderer who was being transported to a penal colony.  But he may not be their greatest danger; because there is someone-- or something-- else close by.  Very close.  An entity that in all probability is responsible for the disappearance of those who came before.  And, if that isn't enough, Fry ascertains that the three suns above them will be setting soon; their world is about to be plunged into absolute darkness.  Soon, they will have to deal with Riddick and the entity stalking them in the pitch black of an eternal night.<p> This concept is nothing new, and there's a sense of been there, done that, about it, but to Twohy's credit, what it lacks in originality he makes up for in presentation by building the suspense and maintaining the tension right up to the end.  The story was obviously influenced by a number of other films, predominately "Alien," "Soldier" and even "Rocketship X-M" from 1950, but there is a unique characteristic about Riddick and a revelation at the end (that has to do with his true nature) that secures a separate entry in the annals of Sci-Fi lore for this film.  This one definitely has it's moments, enough to take it to a level that even such highly touted offerings as "Event Horizon" and "Alien 3" failed to achieve.  <p> The performances, too, are a cut above the usual for this kind of fare, and while no one in the cast is likely to win an award for their work here, they do a good job, individually and collectively.  Radha Mitchell has an affecting screen presence and creates a very real person in Fry, equal to, if not surpassing Sigourney Weaver's Ripley in "Alien."  Diesel is effective, as well, especially in the menace he brings to Riddick, which is subtly honest and believable; the understated way he plays it gives added impact to the character and takes him beyond stereotype (though not quite up to Rutger Hauer's Roy in "Blade Runner").  With Riddick, what you see is basically what you get; there's not a lot of depth or complexity to him, but that's who this guy is, and Diesel plays it well.<p> Also turning in effective performances are Keith David as Imam, Lewis Fitz-Gerald as Paris Ogilvie, Rhiana Griffith as Jack and Claudia Black as Shazza.  As Johns, Cole Hauser is adequate, but he fails to give his character the definition his co-stars achieved with their respective roles.<p> Rounding out the cast are John Moore (Zeke), Simon Burke (Greg), Les Chantery (Suleiman), Sam Sari (Hassan) and Firass Dirani (Ali).  From the beginning, you know what you're in for with this one-- it's a survival story, and few of the characters, if any, are going to make it to the end.  But as entertainment, "Pitch Black" does the job; it's thrilling enough that by the time it's over you feel like you got your five bucks worth.  You may not remember it next month, but while you're watching, it's a pretty good rush.  It's the magic of the movies.</p></body></html>

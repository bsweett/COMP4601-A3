<meta name="summary" content="A great film, not perfect, but filled with some amazing, breathtaking scenes..."></head><body><p>Another fine achievement for Pixar.  Up has wonderous animation (it is Pixar after all), a great storyline, good performances, and some truly magical, mystical moments are scattered throughout this film.  The scene where Ed Asner's house takes off is really beguiling and heartwarming to watch, and the "story" of Ed Asner and his wife's marriage is beautifully done without being mawkish or overly sentimental.  The film loses its way a bit in the 2nd half.  The dialogue isn't the greatest, especially among the talking dogs.  Ed meets his childhood hero in Paradise Falls and it deteriorates way too quickly, as if the childhood hero (played by Christopher Plummer) has to be a bad guy.  The film generally lives up to its hype, especially in the first half, where the term "movie magic" really means something when you see it full force on the screen.<br /><br />I heartily recommend Up.</p></body></html>

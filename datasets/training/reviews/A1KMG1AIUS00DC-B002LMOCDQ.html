<meta name="summary" content="Streep Lets Her Hair Down"></head><body><p>"Mamma Mia! The Movie"  is based on the long-running Broadway play.  Its thin plot was conceived to tie together a catalogue of ABBA songs.  Donna (Meryl Streep) is an independent, single mother who owns a small hotel on a picture-perfect Greek island.  Her daughter, Sophie (Amanda Seyfried), is about to be married and Donna has invited to the wedding two lifelong friends from her one-time singing group, Donna and the Dynamos -- multi-divorcee Tanya (Christine Baranski) and practical, no-nonsense Rosie (Julie Walters).  Sophie has secretly invited three guests of her own.  Longing to discover the identity of her father so he can walk her down the aisle, she brings back three men from Donna's past to the Mediterranean paradise they visited 20 years earlier -- Bill (Stellan Skarsgard), Sam (Pierce Brosnan), and Harry (Colin Firth).<br /> Streep's Donna is far afield from any role the actress has played before.  It's light, almost buoyant, as Donna sings her heart out, dances on a pier, or looks mortified when she meets her three beaus from decades past.  The songs by ABBA include "Dancing Queen," "S.O.S.," "Take a Chance on Me," and "Money, Money, Money."  When you finish watching the film, the songs will remain in your head for hours, if not days.  You'll have to decide if that's a good or a bad thing.  Both Baranski, with her trademark deadpan delivery, and Walters, with take-no-prisoners energy, provide ample comic relief.  The two-disc Special Edition contains a making-of documentary, a detailed featurette on the staging of one musical number ("Lay All Your Love On Me"), a music video, deleted scenes and outtakes, and a digital copy of the movie.</p></body></html>

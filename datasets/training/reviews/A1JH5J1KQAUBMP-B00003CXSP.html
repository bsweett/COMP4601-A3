<meta name="summary" content="Very disappointing"></head><body><p>I was sorry to read that Jodie Foster had decided not to appear in the sequel to the classic &quot;Silence of the Lambs.&quot;  After having seen the film, my only question is: Why didn't Anthony Hopkins pass on it, too?  Rarely has so much talent been wasted.  The pacing was slow and the characterization was weak.  Julianne Moore was fine as Clarice Starling, but the character was much too passive.  Basically, all she did was get dumped on by her superiors while waiting around for Hannibal to show up.  I'm one of those who enjoyed the book, and I'd like to read more about these characters.  However, as far as film goes, I'll just be satisfied with &quot;Silence&quot;.</p></body></html>

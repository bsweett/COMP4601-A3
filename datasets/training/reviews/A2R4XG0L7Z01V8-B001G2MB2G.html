You'd be there all day. So yes there are a lot of reviews that are going to say that it's the weakest movie, cos it's the shortest movie, made from the longest book. And I'm shocked at myself that I'm actually going to say I agree.<br /><br />I recently re-watched the films, and re-read the last three books. Re-watching the films, I discovered that however I much I liked the second movie first time round, Dobby annoyed me every time, and I found myself pressing the skip button. To me, the second movie is the weakest. But now Order Of The Phoenix is following closely behind. But I still like it.<br /><br />Order of the Phoenix the book had simply had too much filler in, and although I enjoy reading it, I do find myself skipping bits, particularly when Dolores Umbridge opens her mouth. She was by the worst character, but not a bad character, just dreadful the way she's portrayed. I was shocked when it was announced that Imelda Staunton would be playing her, and I couldn't imagine how this would work. Until she burst onto screen wearing an array of pink. From the nurse in Shakespeare In Love, to this, certainly a defining career highlight.<br /><br />Lots of stuff has obviously been cut, from important plot points to unnecessary bits. I did find myself watching the movie, and thinking about what had been cut, cos it was really disjointed at times. Dobby was completely cut (thank God for that!), so instead of him telling Harry about the Room of Requirement, it's Neville who finds out. We have to put up with Kreacher, but he barely features. We completely lose Quidditch in this movie, not even a glimpse of Ron letting in a goal (is it still a goal?) The ending seems to be slightly changed, and it's Cho who this time who tells Dolores about the Room of Requirement, and not her best friend, as it was in the book. St Mungo's is all but virtually cut out as well, as are Hermione & Ron's new roles as prefects.<br /><br />I'm disappointed to say that Ron is virtually non-existent in this film, which is a pity, he seems to be shunted aside to introduce Luna Lovegood, and give her more of a role. It's not a good thing that Ron is basically hardly in the film at all. Other reviewers seem to be raving about his comedic timing, he's hardly there!!!<br /><br />The finale seems very tame compared to the book, and I wasn't impressed. I thought the scene where Remus Lupin was holding Harry back, was well done, as it was completely silent apart from a truly brilliant score behind it. And I've always loved the main Harry Potter 'theme' ever since the first film, but there was a whole new dimension added to it to this time, bringing a darker, more haunting theme.<br /><br />I have to say I was not keen on Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore in this film. Stepping into the late Richard Harris' shoes was very brave, but what Dumbledore does during this film is explained at the end, but I still didn't like Michael Gambon.<br /><br />There were some excellent casting decisions in this film - Helena Bonham Carter put in a surprising appearance as Bellatrix Lestrange, a witch-like but incredibly sexy woman, who's a cousin or something to Sirius, but has gone over to the bad side. She was just simply not on screen enough. Neither was the actress who played Nymphadora Tonks, or just Tonks if you will, part of the Order, who can change her hair, clothes, facial features with her flick of her wand. She was a brilliant character in the book, but is sadly underused in this. Apart from a glimpse at the start, and at the end. She was gorgeous too, and I loved how her hair changed when Mad Eye Moody called her Nymphadora! I'm not sure about Luna, played by Evanna Lynch. She was a great little character, but she was just too kooky, and she seemed to have a bit more interaction in the book.<br /><br />I can imagine there's a few people out there who will be very disappointed with Order Of The Phoenix, but personally, I'm counting down the days the next film! Hurry up already!!!</p></body></html>

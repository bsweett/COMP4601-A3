<meta name="summary" content="Joan Allen and Kevin Costner Shine in Over-written dramedy"></head><body><p>Mike Binder wrote and directed "The Upside of Anger," and also plays a somewhat-redeemable loser in the flick.  It's obvious that "TUOA" is a labor of love for Mr. Binder, but it's also obvious that he's in love with it a bit too much.  Virtually every writing instructor tells you that the hardest thing in writing is cutting a favorite character, subplot, or chapter in order to make the entire novel work.  Mr. Binder appears to have lacked that discipline on this project.<br /><br />And yet, "TUOA" succeeds more than it fails.  That success comes from three things - a generally funny script, and two pitch-perfect performances from Joan Allen and Kevin Costner.  Both actors are so true, so wrapped-up in their characters that we alternately acknowledge (in Allen's case) and concede (in Costner's) that these are two of the best actors working today.  (Maybe Costner should just act in movies that he doesn't direct . . .)<br /><br />Allen plays Terry Ann Wolfmeyer, mother of four gorgeous daughters -- one off at college and three in high school.  She lives in a huge McMansion that abuts some surprisingly dark woods.  But there is trouble in paradise (perhaps overly stated by the bar-like window frames everywhere in the house).  Terry's four daughters range from hating her to leaning that way, and Terry's husband (never seen) has apparently fled for Sweden with his nubile secretary.<br /><br />Enraged, Allen crawls inside Grey Goose vodka bottles, where she meets former baseball great Denny Davies (Costner), who lives nearby and hosts a local radio show where he talks about anything except baseball.  Denny, perpetually pleasantly buzzed on Budweiser (from a can), sees another soul in pain and begins one of the laziest, most drunken seductions ever seen on film.  But Terry sees the good in Denny, and she more or less tolerates his advances.<br /><br />Eventually, they become the booziest couple in film history since Nick and Nora Charles from the "Thin Man" movies.  Their relationship hits roadblocks and speedbumps, most notably when Denny does his version of Rhett Butler's "No lock's going to keep me out, Scarlett" rampage -- this is one of the movie's most entertaining scenes.  But through it all, Costner and Allen give Denny and Terry life and depth that is absent from so many other movies.  Watch as Costner nervously caresses his immminent bald spot when pressed into a corner, and watch how Allen shifts from defense-to-attack when challenged by a rebellious daughter.  Fine work.<br /><br />That said, "TUOA" is over-written and includes about five too many subplots.  The daughters get a few individual moments, but there's just not enough for them to do.  Binder gives a good performance as Denny's sleazy womanizing producer Shep, but the movie spends a lot of time crushing and redeeming Shep when he's really a minor player.  Binder also could have easily cut the exposition narrative from the younger daughter . . . cute teenagers only talk like this in movies.<br /><br />All in all, you can miss "TUOA" and you won't have missed much . . . except for two classic performances by two talented actors at the top of their game.  You'll get more than a few laughs out of it, too.</p></body></html>

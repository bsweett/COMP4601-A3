ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST is a cinematic triumph and a powerful allegory about the machinations of the Establishment, otherwise known as Authority.  In this film Authority is personified by Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher), who calmly yet firmly intimidates and terrorizes her charges into submission.  And her charges?  None other than patients in a mental asylum, with most of them living there voluntarily, preferring Ratched's predictable and strict rules than taking their chances in the unpredictable outside world.  Accordingly, when Authority is challenged, and challenged effectively, first the other patients welcome the rebellion--and then Authority lashes back, and does whatever is needed to control and suppress the environment.  But there are consequences; at least one patient is influenced enough to strike out on his own, culminating in a euphoric victory over the status quo.<br /><br />Of course the challenge to Authority is none other than Randall Patrick McMurphy, a slick con faking insanity to avoid actual prison and hard labor.  This character is the glue that holds everything else together, and Jack Nicholson is stellar as McMurphy, playing him with a comedic edge that is captivating.  Yet the entire cast is exceptional--and utterly believable--from Fletcher to Christopher Lloyd to Brad Dourif to Danny DeVito to Will Sampson to the rest of the ensemble.  This movie doesn't feel like a movie--it feels like a documentary depicting a mental ward as it's manipulated by a nurse, then counter-manipulated by one man.  The inherent rebellion against rigid Authority is timeless, making ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST poignant and meaningful then, now, and forever.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.</p></body></html>

The story revolves around Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky), a chubby teenage girl who shocks everyone by landing a coveted role on "The Corny Collins Show," a television dance program. The plot itself is kind of hokey and there are only a few decent songs in the show, but the film is worth checking out for its star-studded cast, which includes a fantastic performance by Michelle Pfeiffer as a vindictive TV station manager, and Christopher Walken and John Travolta as Mr. and Mrs. Turnblad, respectively. (Their romantic tango is hilarious!) All in all, this is an uplifting, energetic little movie that was a lot of fun to watch.</p></body></html>

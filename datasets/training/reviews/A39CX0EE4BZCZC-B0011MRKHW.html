<meta name="summary" content="Lots Of Visual Treats & Good Acting"></head><body><p>If you enjoy great acting performances, stunning direction and cinematography and more (sets, costumes, etc.) you should be entertained for most of the two hours. The story was pretty interesting, too.<br /><br />It's tough to beat a foursome like Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, Clive Owen and Samantha Morton for good acting but - for me,  the star of the film was the photographer. In this case it is Remi Adefarasin. Between his camera-work, the direction of Shekhar Kapur, and the production design by Guy Dyas, this film is a series of pure visual treats.<br /><br />I'm not one who usually pays much attention to costuming but Queen Elizabeth's attire in this movie is spectacular. A nod to the great costume design efforts of Alexandra Byrne.<br /><br />Some people complain Elizabeth isn't portrayed as a strong-enough woman in this movie. I'll use a British response for that: "rubbish." Not only is she strong, she is shown as human - not some cold-blooded machine, but as someone with feelings like the rest of us. All her emotions - and I mean all - are on display along with inspiring leadership of her country, with the latter's welfare her number one priority.</p></body></html>

It also inspired several excellent like themed (called Grand Guignol period) insane horror films of the 60's, which are classic unto their selves! "Hush...Hush Sweet Charlotte," & "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane." Well worth your time to watch!<br /><br />My mother-in law would never took a shower again, after seeing this film! I myself, when I hear something in the shower, guess what pops in my mind???<br /><br />An incredible film, all the more if you saw it in it's day!</p></body></html>

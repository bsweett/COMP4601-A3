<meta name="summary" content="A DVD review"></head><body><p>Slow getting going but once running, it goes like a freight train. The DVD  could have been better. The 28 min documentary is very good. How Gibson  directed and played the star is beyond me? The documentary and the  commentary really shows how hard this ran him into the ground. The  commentary wasn't too verbose, Gibson allows you to enjoy the scenes with  some extra interesting comments that don't distract from the story. In his  commentary he mentions scenes that he had a hard time cutting because they  were very good, but had to cut for time. It would have been nice to have  these included. Overall a must to have in the collection, but if a special  edition is in the planning, it may be better to wait.</p></body></html>

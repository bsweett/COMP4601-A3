<meta name="summary" content="Cool movie"></head><body><p>This movie is much like Da Vicni code, but there'[s enough differences to keep the two from being copies of one another. I haven't read Angels and Demons, but given how much I enjoyed Da Vinci Code, I should enjoy this book as well. The movie was very enjoyable - if you like Da Vinci Code, you should like this, though I thought Da Vinci Code was better.</p></body></html>

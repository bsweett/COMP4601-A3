After the first film the critics seem to think the sequels were formula, but I have always liked the sequels as mindless, but inspiring entertainment! This new and hopefully last installment is very good and is probably the best "Rocky" since the first film, although Rocky 3 is a blast! This film lets the lovable lug go out with style.</p></body></html>

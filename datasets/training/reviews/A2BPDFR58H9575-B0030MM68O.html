<meta name="summary" content=""War's dirty little secret is that some men love it..."></head><body><p>...I'm trying to unpack why, to look at what it means to be a hero in the context of 21st-century combat." Kathryn Bigelow, director/producer<br /><br />The Hurt Locker (2008) is one of the best movies from last year and for me, it is the most deserving nominee  for  Best Picture of the year of five that I have seen so far. The director, Kathryn Bigelow who is known for making the dazzling, dynamic, intelligent and intense action movies, feels at home in the very manly world of directing war film. The Hurt Locker that has been universally praised by the critics and the audiences since it premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2008 may make a history if Bigelow wins the Best Directing Oscar coming March 7th but even if it won't happen, The Hurt Locker has already found its place in history as the remarkable and to the date the best film of the war in Iraq.  It does not explore why we are there and who is responsible for the war. It just places us "inside", along with three main characters, the members of a bomb squad as they go about their daily business, doing their most dangerous and unforgiving job in the world, trying to survive the last 39 days of their rotation. The effect of the total immersion was achieved by Bigelow and Barry Ackroyd, the cinematographer (United 93) by using multiple S16mm cameras to capture multiple perspectives.<br /><br />The Hurt Locker is based on accounts of Mark Boal, a freelance journalist who was embedded with an American bomb squad in the war in Iraq where he would go with the members 10 to 15 times a day to watch their tasks very closely. Based on his experiences, his screen play is the fictional retelling of the  real events.  He said of the film's goal that the creators wanted to show the experiences of the soldiers that we'd never see on the daily news. I believe that director and screenwriter, as well as everyone involved in the making of The Hurt Locker have achieved their goals. The result is an unforgettable film<br /><br />It is remarkable that the film's more famous actors (Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, and David Morse) only show up for a short cameo leaving Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie and Brian Geraghty to carry movie on their own.  All three do an amazing job. Jeremy Renner, relatively un-known becomes a real center of the film and turns a star making performance.  With the face far from a typical cinema hero, he becomes a true hero of the film, the guy who by the words of his younger comrade is not good with people but a great warrior, confident, cool, good at his deadly job, always having it done. It is about him, the epigraph to the film says, war is drug for he is addicted to the rush that only combat can give him.<br /><br />I found the film absolutely riveting, gripping, and intense. It is amazingly shot, the  pace is perfect, and the action scenes executed masterfully. It also works as the characters study of the men at war and how the war affects them.</p></body></html>

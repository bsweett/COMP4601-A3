The former films have omitted details; this one changed the plot pretty significantly. I can accept a film in a different universe than its book, but this is unsettlingly different. Cho was wronged by the screenwriters, much as I can't stand the character. There is no real explanation for the twins sudden dramatic departure. The relevance of Harry's insight into Snape is without anchor. Lucius' role is... well out of proportion (though easy on the eyes). Neville's parents are glossed over, as is the sharing of his birthday with Harry. Sirius' madness is overlooked, thus the later misnomer has little impact. Sirius is aveda'ed. It ended on a way too hopeful note. I am very disappointed with the way Sirius' death was handled. It was anticlimactic. It was too subtle. Part of that was Helena Bonham Carter seeming quite blas&eacute; in her role. She didn't seem like she really wanted to be there so I wasn't really vested in her wrongly cast spell against Sirius. I do feel the silence following Sirius' parting worked against the scene, not for it, creating levity rather than tragic density of emotion. All of the core actors have grown in their roles except Emma. She is mostly heaving chest and eyebrows in this film. She is a beauty, though, and certainly dedicated. Everyone else, though, was wonderful. Dan has come a long way in his acting ability. In this film he comes into his own as an actor. Rup rules, as usual. Draco was under used. This is the first time I thought any of the young ones looked older than their character's ages, specifically Dan and the twins. Evanna Lynch is wonderful. Visually the film is stunning. It is non stop movement, physically and emotionally. The chemistry between Daniel and Gary is spot on. They are very physically comfortable with each other and the little aside touches were in that way more telling than the many embraces that we were to assimilate as "family." There wasn't as much tight writing in this one. Clearly the emphasis had refocused to deepening the emotional range of the characters and actors. I love Rickman and Isaacs.<br /><br />My favorite moment of the film (apart from the "LOOK AT ME" bit) was when Sirius tells harry that when this is all over they will be a proper family, then closes the door on his own family tree. So symbolic, that.<br /><br />The extras on this DVD were not as unwieldy to navigate as with the other DVD releases, but they still would be entertaining to little ones.  This film, though, is probably a bit too intense for little ones to watch.</p></body></html>

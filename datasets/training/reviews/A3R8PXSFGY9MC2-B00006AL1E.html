You can't get much better than this for original storyline and characters. It takes the time travel theme and explores it in much greater depth than any previous film. Fox is superb as the various incarnations of the McFly family (with ground breaking effects for the time) and Christopher Lloyd plays the eccentric inventor to perfection. The time periods in the second and third film are rendered with such detail that you really become engrossed in the film and live it along with the characters. These films aren't heavy, serious movies, but they are brilliantly directed and acted and a great slice of family fun for a Sunday afternoon or just about anytime really. The extras are excellent and really add to your understanding of the whole series and are fascinating to watch in their own right. All in all, these are great films and are highly recommended, worth every penny.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

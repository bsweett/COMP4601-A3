Truth to be told, this movie is extremely well-made, and even though it doesn't make direct reference to all the people Hitler (played by Bruno Ganz) killed, it highlights the fact that he was an extremely unbalanced person capable of doing that and much more.<br /><br />Director Oliver Hirschbiegel weaves an engaging if sometimes shocking story, based on true events, as remembered by people who lived with Hitler during his last days. One of them, Traudl Junge (played Alexandra Maria Lara), was nothing less than one of Hitler's secretaries, and as such a privileged spectator of what was happening in the bunker where Hitler and his entourage stayed. The drama of war is well depicted, as is the fanaticism of many of Hitler's followers, and the desperation of former adherents that ultimately realize that they have been following a madman.<br /><br />Those who already know at least a little about this period will recognize characters such as Heinrich Himmler (Ulrich Noethen), Joseph Goebbels (Ulrich Matthes) or Albert Speer (Heino Ferch), and will also probably learn about others that played a part during those last days. On the other hand, if you don't know a thing about this period, don't let that discourage you: you can always learn, and this is a good opportunity to do so.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend this film. It is long, but thoroughly engaging, and not to be missed. I would like to add that if after seeing "Downfall" you feel like watching a documentary about the same subject, "Blind spot: Hitler's secretary" is also excellent.<br /><br />Belen Alcat</p></body></html>

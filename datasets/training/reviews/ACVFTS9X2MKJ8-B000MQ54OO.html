<meta name="summary" content="I think kids would be bored with this film.  I think it's more focused on an environmental issue"></head><body><p>Musically, this isn't for kids.  That should have been figured out by everyone right away.  Many of the songs (many which are sexually suggestive) are 20 to 40 years old anyway.  The kind of music that we use to listen to when we were kids.  But, to me, I'd rather our kids listen to sexy songs instead of today's angry songs.<br /><br />And one moment in the film Mumbles is being singled out as if something is wrong with him because he's different.  This could have been a discussion similar to telling a child that he's wrong for being gay. Which has got to be the hardest thing for any naturally sexually healthy parent to have to do.<br /><br />But, the entertainment of this musical film changes when it suddenly becomes a message about our endangered environment.  We're taking away all the fish so the penguins are having a harder time to survive.  In my opinion, the best way to reduce the amount of starving penguins in this world is to hunt them too.  I wouldn't mind trying a penguin sandwich, or try penguin soup.  And how would we prepare a meal with a penguin?  Should it be broiled, boiled, or fried?  Or steamed penguin meat with broccoli on rice?  How about breaded and fried, and dipped in Ranch dressing?  I wonder how penguin meat would be on a cracker with cheese. Umm, how about penguin enchiladas?  I'd be happy to try anything on my plate if it would help to balance our ecology.<br /><br />"I'd like to have one McPenguin burger with fries and a coke, please."  Maybe we can give the fish a break and try eating more penguin.  Could that help the environment?</p></body></html>

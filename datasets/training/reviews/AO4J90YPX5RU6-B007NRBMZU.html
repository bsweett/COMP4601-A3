High Marks!!"></head><body><p>~The Butterfly Effect~ proves that actor Ashton Kutcher is capable of much more than just your average screw ball comedy such as ~Just Married~ and ~Dude, Where's my Car?~. Not to say that those films aren't okay for what they are, it's just that this movie delivers. It's a sure crowd pleaser. Some may have a hard time following it at first but hang out, it explains itself in due time. Do you remember the rules in 1985's ~Back to the Future~ when it comes to time travel? One false move can change everything. This movie has a field day with making those false moves and the pros and most often cons that are involved. ~The Butterfly Effect~ goes from the present to the past repeatedly. All in an effect to assure the right future. There is an alternate ending. This is the ending for the director's cut. I like the version that was released in theaters. The director's cut takes the movie a step futher, but I think the non-director's cut was more pleasing for me. I've recommended this film to many others, if you haven't seen it and you're interested.. give it a shot.</p></body></html>

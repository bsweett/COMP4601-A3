Like almost all adaptations it takes some liberties with the source novel's story, but I think it manages to preserve the essence; so that you feel the story more even if you do not understand it as precisely. Unfortunately most of the comments and reviews are rather useless for anyone thinking about viewing the film or for someone looking to better understand what they just viewed. So here are a few random points to consider.<br /><br />  The film is basically a blend of "The Dust Factory" (2004) and "Speak" (2004); with elements of "Silent Hill" (2006) and "What Dreams May Come" (1998). If you like that type of stuff you should get off on "The Lovely Bones". If this sort of story is not your cup-of-tea there is still enough quality acting and imagery to make it time well spent for a technical film buff.<br /><br />  As in the novel, the entire story is told from the point-of-view (POV) of 14-year-old Susie Salmon who became the victim of a serial killer. The main character tells her story in flashbacks and subdued voice-over, as she observes the world from a personalized transitional realm between earth and heaven. Looking into the world much like the penguin in the family's snow globe, as her grieving family tries to cope with her death and her brazen killer goes largely unnoticed.<br /><br />  The distanced voice-over gives Susie more dimensionality; her calm tone is often contradicted by what is happening in the frame and it contrasts nicely with the shallow (but normal) teen qualities of her character before death. "Depth" is an important symbolic element in the story, which is full of juxtapositions between closed places (sinkholes, basement, a compartment under the floorboards, dollhouses, ships in bottles) and bucolic vistas. There is an especially effective montage early in the film as the editor cuts back and forth between the trapped Susie and her unsuspecting family at the dinner table; with each cut Susie looks smaller and younger.<br /><br />  "Atonement's" Saoirse Ronan plays Susie, and her subtly expressive performance elevates the film to "must see" status. A young actor this instinctively talented and effortlessly charming only comes along about once in a decade, and rarely are they matched with a role this perfect for them at a particular point in their careers. Ronan should have a lengthy and very successful acting career but it is unlikely that she will again play a character that is such a perfect physical and emotional fit. For serious film buffs this is one of those historical moments.<br /><br />  Ronan's performance transcends the genre, unexpectedly causing the film to work as a very affecting coming-of-age story. Susie clings to a living world that is lost to her in much the same way that Georgia Lass did in the "Dead Like Me" series, and in the process experiences things that positively change her, even after her death. Allowing her to reconcile things and to even appreciate "the lovely bones that had grown around my absence" as she comes to terms with "the world without me in it".<br /><br />  Director Peter Jackson chooses to emphasize her in-between world with a lot of expressionistic special effects visuals. While this was not a point of emphasis in Sebold's novel, film is a visual medium and these provide an opportunity to introduce symbolic connections between the two worlds and to showcase Susie's journey. Even more importantly, Jackson nicely fills the frame with Susie's innocent features as she bravely navigates her strange land with looks of wonder and on occasion looks of terror. Using a 14-year-old girl amplifies the emotional power of this stuff, it simply would not have been as effective with someone a different age.  Lurking beneath his psychological thriller storyline, Jackson steers the film toward a rather deep allegorical take on an existential theme. It explores the isolation of someone as they realize that they no longer belong in the world.<br /><br />  I am not a Peter Jackson fan; his films, from minimalist efforts like "Heavenly Creatures" to exercises in excess like "King Kong", have never really connected with me. And he was probably not the ideal choice for a film like "The Lovely Bones".  But his only real misstep here, the insertion of Susan Sarandon's comically overplayed grandmother into the middle of the story, was not significant enough to be a fatal flaw. And another director might not have chosen to emphasize the process of Susie growing stronger, which I found to be the most appropriate emphasis for a "practical" adaptation of the original story.<br /><br />  Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</p></body></html>

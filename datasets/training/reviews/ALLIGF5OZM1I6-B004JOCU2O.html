Miller, Ethan Suplee and Kevinn Corrigan<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Mark Bomback<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Tony Scott<br /><br />Rated: PG - 13<br />Genre: Action / Thriller<br />Release Date: 12 November 2010<br />Review Date: 09 November 2010<br /><br />Unstoppable is the perfect title for a Denzel Washington flick because that is exactly what he is. He simply doesn't make bad movies and his performances are always riveting and dead-on. And if you were to surround him with the talents of Chris Pine and Rosario Dawson, you really couldn't go wrong.<br /><br />Director Tony Scott has done just that with Unstoppable, marking it as his impressive 16th feature film and fifth collaboration with Denzel. From Top Gun and Days of Thunder to Beverly Hills Cop II and The Taking of Pelham 123, who better to direct an action picture based on true events of a runaway train carrying tons of deadly chemicals, than Tony Scott?<br /><br />That's the plot and you know the actors so let's meet the characters. Denzel plays Frank; a single father to two teenage daughters working their way through college by waiting tables at Hooters. Don't trouble yourself; Denzel makes the joke for you. I'm just curious if Hooters paid Fox or if Fox paid Hooters? Frank has been working in a rail yard for 28 years and today he's got a new partner.<br /><br />Chris Pine plays Will - said partner, and the two don't hit it off so well at first. Frank is old school and Will is new school and there's no teacher around to make sure they play nice. It's just them and us in the cockpit of their train for the majority of their screen time. Don't think we spend the entire film stuck in a conductor box with these two though because we don't; they're not on the runaway train by the way.<br /><br />The train has runaway (is it just me or does the term runaway train just sound funny?) due to the incompetence of two idiots played by two funny and good actors whom I'll save for you. Their boss Connie, played by the lovely Rosario Dawson, must clean up their mess, serving as mediator between them, other employees, Frank and Will, an inspector, and her stiff corporate A-hole of a supervisor, Galvin (Kevin Dunn).<br /><br />Galvin is more concerned with the potential financial tragedy of a `train wreck' as the beast is half a mile long (a lot of money folks), than he is with the moral dilemma of how many lives will be lost should a wreck occur. The train has to go somewhere and it's headed straight for a big town; of course. Frank, Will and Connie aren't having it though because they're the good guys after all; so they devise a plan to earn that title.<br /><br />Unstoppable is about a train on the loose - but it's good, fast, funny and fun.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="About Schmidt Meets Dirty Harry..Sort of"></head><body><p>In what promises to be Clint Eastwood's valedictory role as an actor he once again reimagines the Man With No Name-Dirty Harry persona so that's so burnished in our collective psyche.  Walt Kowalski(Eastwood) is a retired Ford worker who can be best described as grizzled, profane, and just a little bit Archie Bunker-ish in his worldview.  Not the least bit misanthropic he feels more of a connection to his '72 Gran Torino than he does his own family.  Dig a little deeper, though, you find a man bearing the scars of his service in the Korean conflict.  Walt has an ingrained perception of the American dream but finds that being challenged by the changing face of his Detroit neighborhood particularly his reaction to the Hmong family who live next door to him.  Through a series of events, though, Walt developes a connection daresay a deep-rooted respect for the Hmong. Walt also feels, even in his dotage, the obligation to serve as protector to this family in an ever increasing hostile environment.  I harken back to "Unforgiven" when Eastwood re-evaluated his Western persona.  Here, Eastwood does a re-examination of his more reactionary film characters.  This film was cleverly advertised by it's makers as a geriatric action extravaganza.  For sure justice is meted out in the end but not remotely in a way you would think.  This film definitely stands out in the canon of Eastwood's illustrious career.</p></body></html>

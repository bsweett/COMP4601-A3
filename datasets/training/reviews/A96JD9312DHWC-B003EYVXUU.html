He is bullied and not really seen by his parents, leading him to dream of other things. Amongst those dreams is something dark and hard, allowing him to see himself sticking a knife into those who pick on him. He also looks out his window and sees other people and there he envisions himself with another role. This play and this want leads him to see a 12 year old girl named Abby, whom he seems to like right away. Never mind the fact that she smeels different and never mind the fact that she doesn't wear shoes in the winter or know what a rubix cube is. she is something that he desires and that sees him as someone. She smiles after a time and she gives him advice, telling him to hit those who hit him harder than he dares. Still, she also says she cannot be his friend because she is not a she at all.<br />what does all this mean? Is Owen finding love or another dark hole? The questions and the answers are what makes Let Me In so good and then some.<br /><br />When it comes to Let Me In, the book and the foreign release are already in the books. They are good, too, adn they have a lot to bank on. Still, this release adds more, and makes its own remarks. Whether it is on the man that Abby lives with or the way things transpire with the acid and the man, it all takes its own shape. Even if you have seen it you will see more, and the more is great. The hospital, for example, shows you more of Abby and the first attack shows you more as well. you also have a new way of "collecting," and a new presentation.<br />It all changes.<br /><br />I personally thought this was good and that it was its own thing. It had its own comments and its own style, making it make its own way forward. From the special effects window to the way the people are seen, there are changes and there are staples that are either needed and stay or that are played with and go. The people that live across from here are changed and yet they are still there, and these things are good and they leave other ways to see. I also like the way everything rounds to a close, with it changing and yet keeping things open, allowing it to be more. I like this as well, and I like the way that it is all seen. It makes a great dynamic and a horror movie, playing to all those invovled. It really deseves a watch.<br /><br />I admit I was afraid of this at first. I learned quickly, however, and this was good. It said that I would want to see and I did, and that left things in a nice place. It also left me with a 4.5 - 5 star movie, and a shocked look on my face. I expected good but not this. I am pleased and then some.<br /><br />Thank you.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An aight hostage drama that kept me entertained"></head><body><p>In Hostage, Bruce Willis plays Jeff Talley, a former Los Angeles hostage negotiator who moves to the 'burbs after messing up on the job and letting a husband kill his wife and son. Talley is now the Chief of Police in a quieter, calmer neighborhood, and his main concern is saving his marriage and keeping his teenage daughter in line. That is, until a group of teens break into the home of a rich family and take the father and children hostage after a failed attempt to steal the family's Cadillac Escalade. Little do they know, the father is actually a crooked money launderer with bad guys on his tail. Unsure what to do, one of the kids shoots a cop, locks down the house, and Talley has to come to the rescue.<br /><br />I'm a person who likes bad movies. I actually kind of revel in the trash that's out there. And that being said, I liked this movie. It was entertaining and action-packed. I stayed interested the entire way through, and actually wondered what would happen next. That being said, it's not great cinema. It's not fantastic. It's reminiscent of one of my favorite trashy movies, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/078322933X">Fear</a> with Marky Mark and Reese Witherspoon. If you like that movie, you can enjoy this one. Bruce Willis is his typical, surly cop self, and the supporting cast is aight. If you're in the mood for entertainment, pick this one up. If you want fantastic hostage drama...I don't really know what to tell you. Maybe try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790739739">The Negotiator</a>.</p></body></html>

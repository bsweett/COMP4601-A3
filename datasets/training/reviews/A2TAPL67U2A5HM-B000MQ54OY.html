<meta name="summary" content="Happy Feet (Full Screen Edition)"></head><body><p>Happy Feet (Full Screen Edition) is an OK animated movied. The story line is about mumble a penguin that dances but can not sing. In penguin society everything is based on how you sing. Because of this he is seen as different and an outcast. The message to accept others is a good one. However, then the move starts with an overtly political message about evil humans and good animals. A children's movie should not deal with politics. The voice acting is great and Elijah Wood is great as Mumble. Still an OK movie. 3/5.</p></body></html>

As Blade (Wesley Snipes), the half-human, half-vampire slayer recovers his presumed-dead mentor, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), he runs afoul of vampires bringing surprising news.  A new kind of vampire (known as Reapers) have appeared on the scene, and basically are killing ANYTHING to control their thirst.  With a pack of vampires (trained to kill Blade), Blade and crew try to contain the spread of the Reapers, but may be betrayed by forces within this teneuous alliance.  Directed by Guillermo Del Toro ("Cronos", "Mimic"), and boasting some shocking visual effects (such as the Reapers method of draining blood), this is definitely a good ride for "Blade" fans.  The DVD includes some funny commentary tracks with director Del Toro and Wesley Snipes, a detailed "making-of" documentary, a humorous batch of deleted scenes, documentaries on the visual effects, and a lot more.  This one is recommended (but not for the squeamish).</p></body></html>

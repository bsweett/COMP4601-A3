<meta name="summary" content="Fincher works magic on the mind's eye"></head><body><p>In the interest of full disclosure, let me tell you some things about myself:<p>I am a Brad Pitt fan.  I am a Morgan Freeman fan.  I am a David Fincher fan.  I am a fan of serial killer movies.<p>So we've perfected the recipe here, then.  All of those elements are at the top of their game.<p>Pitt is immature and kinetic, strong-willed and strong-headed.  He plays off Freeman perfectly.  Freeman, for his part, is quiet and thoughtful.  You can see just from his eyes that he is tired and spent, but feels that this one last case is important and necessary.  He does his duty.  He is a rock (to Pitt's roll?).  David Fincher is Fincher.  His style is just so addicting when he's working with a plausible (in context) script.  He gets to build an anonymous city, making it dreadful and sickening, and run his characters through its mill.  Everything is dark and wet, never letting you take a breath.  Gwyneth Paltrow, in two brief scenes, is quite sweet and touching, exhibiting both humour (with Pitt) and torment (with Freeman).  I usually can do without her, but here she is a welcome relief from all the bleakness.  And of course one of my favourite actors plays the killer, with shaved-head intensity.  It's a great secret that - even though it's already out of the bag - I won't tell.<p>...yecapS niveK s'tI<p>Top to bottom, this is a great movie.  From the first seconds of the first scene, through the opening credits (they look like a Nine Inch Nails video), to the last moments of the closing credits, it's just great.  Every scene is pulled off perfectly; all the details are just right.  Morgan Freeman looking up Dante in the library; the killer's dank little apartment; Pitt and Freeman bonding over beers in a bar... all superbly done.  Of course, the best parts are the murder scene aftermaths, based on the seven deadly sins.  You never see any violence in these scenes, but what you do see is actually a bit more disturbing: gritty tableaus of human suffering.  Fincher's greatest choice is not showing us all that's going on, letting the mind of the viewer fill in most of the grisly details.  My favourite is the 'lust' sequence.  I didn't fully understand what had happened until I watched the movie a second time.  And now I can't get the imagery out of my head.  It works quite powerfully.<p>And the denouement is just staggering.  It's 15 minutes of slow build-up.  You hope that the payoff can live up to the suspense.  And they keep going.  And the suspense builds.  And you hope... and you hope... and you hope.... And the payoff is brilliant.  It perfectly sums up the films themes, and is a very satisfying narrative conclusion to a highly suspenseful mystery/thriller movie.  And my favourite part about the ending: after 2 hours of dirty, dark, and rainy, the film ends at high noon in an open field.  A great contrast, that.  Fincher really knows how to use imagery to make a point.</p></body></html>

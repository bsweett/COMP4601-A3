<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Hi-Def rendering of a classic anti-war film"></head><body><p>I saw this classic many years ago in a downtown San Francisco cinema and it blew me away.  Since then I have seen periodically and the film has never lost it's luster to me. In fact seeing now in Blu-ray, it has gained even newer perspective in it's themes of militarism, honor and the madness of war as when the camp doctor rails at the end, "It's madness, madness".  William Holden was added to the movie so that the film would gain an international following since he was the number one star at the time and in retrospect, it was a wise move to contrast his cynical American soldier/sailor to the disciplined, high principled Colonel Nicolson, superbly played by Alec Guinness who was thought of as a light comedian due to his many successful Ealing comedies.  As Holden put it, "Alec received the glory, but I became rich (thanks to a percentage deal)".  Nevertheless this film will hold up for the ages and the Blu-ray transfer is even better than when it was shown on HD Net Movies.  If you love war films and classic cinema--do check this one out!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A homage to Kubrick - with a splash of Aronofsky's love of cinema"></head><body><p>Without a doubt, Darren Aronofsky has subtly crafted the best film of the year.  With this film, he has introduced a brave new paintbrush, a canvas that would be unpopular with the amateur cinefile, but over time will be considered an independent classic.  Like he has done with such powerful films like "Pi" and "Requiem for a Dream", Aronofsky, with "The Fountain" has entered into the ranks of such budding directors as Richard Kelly and Christopher Nolan.  While his work may never be seen as mainstream, his thoughts are continuous, his sentences are bold and detailed, and his worlds are pure imagination.  This, "The Fountain", simply defines what a movie-going experience should be like.  He forces the audience to think, use the visual clues throughout to tell us the themes without making our antagonist speak them loudly for audiences to hear.  He designs outside the lines, and his film are considered too "thinking" for the average viewer, but to me, this was a movie, simply put, about love.  "The Fountain" is one of those broad scoping epic stories that felt eerily Kubrik-ian with its style, but purely Aronofsky with its imagery.  This is not a story for the weak of heart (or mind for that matter), but simply a story about a never aging love pushed through the heartstrings of immortality.<br /><br />To begin, Aronofsky has designed a beautiful cast to represent this story.  In several interviews, he talks about his desire to make a science-fiction film, and at first I was skeptical on how well "Van Helsing" himself could voice Aronofsky words, but coupled with Rachel Weiss, the two are magic.  Hugh Jackman is phenomenal in the role of conquistador, scientist, and finally explorer.  His expressions are Oscar worthy, and his projection of honesty is empowering.  He devours each of these three segments with enough force that accolades should have come his way.  Coupled with the way Aronofsky framed this film, the two work hand in hand.  There is little told of Tommy's love for Izzi, but what Jackman creates through his characters transforms this from a mediocre missed sci-fi romance to something bolder, and more determined.  Jackman with Weiss create another fold in this story all together.  From their initial meeting, the symbolism of the ring, the connections between the decades were subtle, but the two create chemistry with their whispers, their body language, and their obvious passion for this project.  This was not simply a Aronofsky film, but a story that all actors, visuals, and gaffers embraced.  From the opening shot you could tell that we were unprepared for this ride that Jackman wasn't going to be "cute", but instead determined and sad at the same time.  We were ready for the science fiction, but the history, the honest love, the religious symbols were exciting and fresh.  Again, Kubrick would have giving Aronofsky a standing ovation, his lessons have been passed to a new generation, and they don't believe in dumb blockbusters.  This was a science fiction film second, a love story first, which reminded me further of Kubrick's "2001" - perhaps this was a bit of an homage to that.  This was a project of passion and all the cast embodied it.<br /><br />Aronofsky's storytelling abilities continue to impress.  From "Pi" I was immediately hooked and with his honest adaptation of "Requiem for a Dream", he proved that he could tackle anything from the absurd to the taboo.  Science fiction wasn't going to stop him, but it wasn't going to be your average story.  This was going to demonstrate the longevity of love and the secrets of our universe.  His choice of edits, quick cuts, and powerful angles are more than impressive.  He constructs a story that spans eras, but still feels grounded in one specific moment.  It felt like listening to a remake of a classic song, while the beats may be different - the same message was being sent.  His attention to detail was magnificent.  I love cinema that forces you to remember other moments from earlier, small symbolic items, or details that may seem unimportant at the time, but as the focus becomes concentrated, it becomes clear.  This is more than just a film, but an experience similar to that of fighting for the love of your life.  To me, that is what transformed "The Fountain" from your average sci-fi experience to something larger.  Aronofsky created an emotion, not just a visual reference, and you experience the film for the themes he created.  This isn't a sit-back-and-relax film, but an emotional roller coaster of truth and honesty.  Kubrick has done it, Aronofsky just expanded the premise.<br /><br />With such praise for this bold new image, a comment should be made that it wasn't perfect.  The small blemishes were nearly hidden by the epic scope of this story.  The blemishes could be the lack of decibels during the whispering moments.  Aronofsky creates the unknown when Tommy whispers into the tree or to his wife, clues that will bring us full circle soon, but I found myself using the subtitle button to ensure that I found the words correctly.  The other small blemish could be the other characters surrounding Tommy and Izzi.  Aronofsky brought a couple back from his other films, but their emotions were staged and wooden.  They added very little to this story and the overall sensation of "The Fountain".  While I see the value of them being around our characters (to build the world), this could have simply been a story about two people, their love, and their quest.<br /><br />Overall, "The Fountain" was a fresh new film experience for me.  With the downtrodden nature of the Hollywood recycling bin, I was beginning to give up hope that imagination would still be used in today's releases.  As always, audiences were not as forthcoming with this film, and a quick release to DVD was inevitable.  This is a movie that is beautiful, poignant, and symbolic all at the same time - it forces you to think, use your mind, and find the hidden clues throughout.  This is not a film for all, but many should experience it.  The acting was superb, possibly the best we will see from Hugh Jackman, and Aronofsky's style and image stood on their own two feet.  This was a well-rounded film with slight blemishes that would never been seen by the amateur film watcher.  It took you all over the map without pity or remorse.  "The Fountain" was like watching a disciple of Kubrick announce his final project.  Aronofsky continues to impress with his films.  They have huge depth and range, yet easily forgotten through the course of the year.  "The Fountain" should have won awards, and in time I think it will, but for now it needs to be watched and recommended.  This is one of my favorites of the year.<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****</p></body></html>

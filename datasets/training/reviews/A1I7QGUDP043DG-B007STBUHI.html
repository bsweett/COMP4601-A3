This movie will endure generations of action/suspense movies no matter how advanced the special effects, and the film is still talked about on beaches by people of all ages. I still get chills when Quint relates the story of being surrounded by sharks and his buddies being taken, one by one, explaining his hatred of sharks. I've watched many scenes over and over and they just get better. There is a scene they cut out that I loved too where Quint torments a kid playing the clarinet. Buy the Anniversary edition and watch some of the features that had to be cut; there's some good stuff there. I watch this DVD at least once every three months...<br /><br />Chrissy K.

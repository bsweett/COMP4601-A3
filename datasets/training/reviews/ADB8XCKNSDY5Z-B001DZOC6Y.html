It actually has a much more real feel.  Many times during the film I thought of how terrifying it would be to see such a mass of suicide where nobody knew the cause.<br /><br />I do think it would have been better to leave the cause unidentified than to tie it in with a liberal environmentalist message, but I'm able to look past the whole plant thing and enjoy something different for a change.  Refreshing to see some horror that didn't involve a mindless schmuck parading around with a weapon.  But you know, there's a huge audience for that sort of thing apparently, and they must never get tired of it, as evidenced by all the negative reviews posted here.</p></body></html>

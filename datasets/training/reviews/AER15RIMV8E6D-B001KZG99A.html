Everybody did a great job and all the actors were casted perfectly. A billionaire inventor named Tony Stark is held hostage in Afghanistan for months because terrorists want him to build a bomb. Instead, he builds an armor suit so he can escape. He is rescued and and while he is back home, he tries to reinvent the suit. He makes it and tries to figure out how to work it. His sexy beautiful personal assisstant, Pepper Potts doesn't really him to do it, because she thinks he might die, but he tells her that he must do it to save lives. I love all of Iron Man's gadgets. Soon, some military people think Iron Man is a threat, so Tony asks his friend Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to stop the planes from trying to kill him. His other friend, Obadiah Stane betrays him and builds his own iron suit. If you love action, and comic book movies, you'll love IRON MAN!!!</p></body></html>

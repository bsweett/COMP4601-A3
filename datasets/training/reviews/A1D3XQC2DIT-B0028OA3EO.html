If you have watched the preview for the movie, you may be familiar with a scene involving Superman and an airplane. It is maybe 30 minutes into the movie and I kid you not, they could have ended it right there and I would have paid to see it a second time. That is not to say the movie was downhill from that point on, but it was worth the price of admission, even in the days of increased movie ticket prices.<br /><br />I had heard reports that Superman Returns was too much of a love story and not enough of what we should expect from a Superman movie: Superman fighting crime and saving the day. The (awkward) love story rekindled between our caped hero and Lois Lane was obvious, but not overbearing. There were scenes devoted to it entirely, but this was not the first Superman movie to do it. Let's not forget the rest of the movie, however. Bryan Singer did a great job of incorporating all of Superman's powers over the course of the film. We see plenty of flying, impenetrable skin, super-human strength, heat vision and super breath. But don't leave out the tights and the cape; Superman was well represented throughout the film.<br /><br />I liked how well Brandon Routh maintained the dichotomy of the character he played, selling the Clark Kent secret identity. He stayed clumsy as Clark and was, for the most part, strong and confident as Superman. I was among those in the camp who thought Tom Welling probably should have gotten the part when "Mr. Unknown" Brandon Routh was announced. Sorry Tom, but Brandon ended up being a good casting choice. Tom Welling may have been a little too "teen drama" and not enough "comic-book superhero" for the part.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey is no Gene Hackman, but he did well as Lex Luthor. Watching Lex in action I did have the realization that though I typically prefer Marvel books, I like DC villains much better. My favorites are The Joker (big surprise), The Riddler and Lex Luthor. DC villains, to me, seem much more... complex. Lex Luthor is a bit over the top and he does require some over-acting and forced lines as well as some just-right facial expressions to fully portray his quirks. Spacey kept his composure and I really think he nailed the part.<br /><br />So I really did like the movie, but I did have a few small gripes. You probably would not believe I wrote this if there wasn't a flaw or two pointed out...<br /><br />_<br /><br />Did they make Kate Bosworth look like Natalie Portman on purpose? Or did it just happen naturally? Don't get me wrong, she looked better as Lois Lane than she has in any other role I have seen her in. All I am saying is that after Natalie does a movie or two with a shaved head, maybe Hollywood is trying to snatch her look back from her before she has a chance to make another movie with hair.<br /><br />I love that James Marsden continues to get roles in comic book films as the guy who has the girl who is at least arguably in love with someone else (think Cyclops). I understand he followed Writer/Producer/Director Bryan Singer from the X-Men series to Superman, but he is now sufficiently typecast.<br /><br />Was Brandon Routh's "Clark Kent" hair a tribute to Jason Schwartzman?<br /><br />Kal Penn goes from a late night craving for White Castle burgers to playing Lex Luthor's goon? Really? It does not seem like the most natural transition to me. At least I am pretty sure he did not have a single speaking part.<br /><br />_<br /><br />Petty criticisms aside, I really liked Superman Returns. The movie had a few slow scenes, primarily right at the beginning, but they served well enough to build up to the climax. The casting was great, even down to Sam Huntington as Jimmy Olsen. I hope I can find time to see it again...in IMAX this time.</p></body></html>

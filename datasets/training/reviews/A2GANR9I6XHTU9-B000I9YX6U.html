Robin williams is a good actor and did do a good job portraying this sy character but the actors they used for the family annoyed me and didnt fit role as good as if someone else did that part.But the ending of movie wasnt that good - it was ok if you like a thriller i guess.I love thrillers but this movie just didnt do it for me.I would rent first if i were you.</p></body></html>

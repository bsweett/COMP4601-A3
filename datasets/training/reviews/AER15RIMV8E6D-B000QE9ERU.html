<meta name="summary" content="Max Payne For Marvel Comics!!!"></head><body><p>I like this movie because it reminds me a lot of one of my favorite games; Max Payne. Frank Castle is on his last mission, and kills the son of Howard Saint. Howard's wife tells him to kill Frank's family. I love the plot about Frank Castle punishing those who killed his family. It sucked that everyone in Frank's family died. EVERYONE! I love that skull shirt! Frank eventually becomes friends with Dave, Bumpo and Joan and moves in with them. While he's there, he plans his punishment against Howard Saint. There are a lot of awesome action sequences! If you love action, Max Payne, and Marvel comic movies, you'll love THE PUNISHER!!!</p></body></html>

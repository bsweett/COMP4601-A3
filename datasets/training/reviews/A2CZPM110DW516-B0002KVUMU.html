<meta name="summary" content="Proof that less is more"></head><body><p>I really wanted to like "Van Helsing," especially after reading various interviews with the director who acknowledged that he was inspired by his love for the Universal horror classics. Unfortunately, he comes closer to recreating the mediocrity of 1944's "House of Frankenstein" than one of the studio's superior horror classics from the 1930's.<br /><br />There is a lot to like about "Van Helsing." The sets are impressive and the special effects can not be faulted. There are plenty of impressive action sequences that can make you gasp. In the end, though, it proves the old adage that "less is more."<br /><br />The movie is positively stuffed from end to end with breathtaking stunts and special effects, leaving little time for character development or story. That's unfortunate because there are, indeed, several novel twists worth exploring, such as Dracula's financial support of Dr. Frankenstein's experiments. But this is simply mentioned then quickly discarded in favor of stunts and effects that grow monotonous because they are so plentiful. There's never time to catch your breath. For some viewers, these complaints may sound more like recommendations. Rest assured, if it's action you want, this movie delivers . . . and delivers, and delivers.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman is okay, but his Van Helsing is closer in spirit to Indiana Jones and James Bond than the character created by Bram Stoker and played to perfection in other movies by such actors as Edward Van Sloan, Peter Cushing, Laurence Olivier and Anthony Hopkins. As Dracula, however, Richard Roxburgh seems too intent on channeling Bela Lugosi and too often brings to mind Al Lewis, Grandpa on "The Munsters," instead.<br /><br />Frankenstein's monster and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde also put in appearances, but nothing really progresses beyond the surface level. Too bad. The premise is great. The effects are superb. The action is well-staged. The story, however, falls short.<br /><br />Brian W. Fairbanks</p></body></html>

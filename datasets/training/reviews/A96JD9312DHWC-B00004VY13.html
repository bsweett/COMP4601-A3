Here, he joins with a Kurt Russell at his prime to fight off the wonders of &quot;The Thing from Another World.&quot; To call this a great movie is kind of shortchanging it because the effects, combined with a truth to the original short story, relives a horror that could be called, by a person who witnessed this at the age of five, delightfully scarring. Show it to you kids and show them what could be hiiding in their snowmen! Seven stars, yummy!</p></body></html>

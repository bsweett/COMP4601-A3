<meta name="summary" content="Storm Chasers Extraordinare"></head><body><p>This movie must have gotten Storm Chasers a real boost.  Just as more and more videos of twisters appeared on nightly TV in the 90s this movie came out.<p>One thing this movie is though it is an great introduction, in a bit of a farcical way to the science of tornados.  This season of twisters has been very devastating and with so many storm chasers today, there are even what they call 'chaser jams' as the cars load the roads.  Unlike the competition in the movie for who will get the best view, there is a courtesy.<p>However, this movie has great special effects, the cow in the air scene was somewhat comical.  Touching was the scene of the destruction of a friends house, and horrifying was the scene just prior to it of a twister hitting a drive-in theater.<p>Hunt and Paxton work together well in this movie.  The attempt to outrun the category 5 at the end was a bit unreal, yet you are on the edge of your seat as the 1/2 a mile wide funnel gets ever closer.<p>I have purchased this movie as a gift for friends and have it on my want list for the future.</p></body></html>

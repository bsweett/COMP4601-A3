<meta name="summary" content="Not as good as The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe"></head><body><p>This is a good movie, yeah, but not, like, really good. For one they just changed way too much from the book. I mean yeah, things will change in movie adaptions of books, but this one took it a bit too far. For one, that little romance with Susan and Caspian was just stupid. Peter and Caspian bickering all the time was also stupid. A few other things, too, but I won't go into them. It's a pretty good movie, but not great. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare</p></body></html>

A good hearted friar wants to earn some money to better feed the children in the orphanage in Mexico, so he secretly becomes a wrestler to earn the money and earn respect.  I thought the first time I saw him in the tights was hysterical.  Also the fact that he farts every time he jumps was funny in a stupid way.  By the end of the movie though, the joke of his flabby body has run thin.  I didn't find much else in the movie to laugh at.  Black is a good personality and very likeable.  His comedy is best when it is physical.  There just wasn't enough to sustain this movie.  It felt like a SNL skit that is expanded into a feature length film.  It is a funny concept for a few minutes, but after that it starts to falter.  I would rent this one first to make sure it is to your taste.  I know several people that love this money and a few more that hated it.</p></body></html>

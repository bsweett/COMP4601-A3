<meta name="summary" content="Forget the remake. This is the definative FOG."></head><body><p>After watching the lack-lustre 2005 remake of Carpenter's THE FOG, I quickly ran to my nearest television set and inserted this DVD into my DVD player just so I can recall the days when horror film's were made without the over-use of annoying CGI.<br /><br />This film (along with that other Carpenter flick) is a testament to the fact that you do not need a $30 million dollar budget to create an effective scary movie. All that is required is the talent, the mood, a great location, a creepy story and VOILA!!<br /><br />The story takes place in Antonio Bay. A depressingly gloomy but charming seaside town whose inhabitants become the victims of a thick, glowing fog carrying the angry ghosts of lepers who were killed in a shipwreck a century earlier. What makes these ghosts even more frightening is that they are not of the "transparent" kind. They're covered in rags, dripping in salt water and armed with knives, hooks, swords and possibly every other sharp, metallic object you can think of.<br /><br />The cast is first-rate. The stand-out performer is Carpenter's then-wife, Adriene Barbeau who plays Stevie Wayne. A sexy radio disc-jocky who becomes trapped inside a light-house while the rest of the cast seeks refuge in an old church outside of town. Scream-Queens Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh and Nancy Loomis co-star as the other luck-less female victim's and put their screaming talents to good use. The legendary John Houseman makes a great cameo appearance in the opening sequence, setting the tone. The great cast, the location, the creative fog effects and a simple yet effective Carpenter score all contribute in making this low-budget chiller a winner.<br /><br />However, it should be stated that THE FOG is far from perfect. Despite a chilling first 20 minutes, the film takes its time in building it's tension and therefore drags quite a bit. And even those who love this movie will admit that it's no where near as effective as Carpenter's HALLOWEEN and under close inspection, plot holes become too apparent. But us fans don't seem to care since we all know that THE FOG is not to be taken THAT seriously. It's about a killer fog, people. Anyone approaching this for the plot or character development is sorely lacking "upstairs". Film's such as these need to be viewed solely for 2 purposes- To be entertained and to be scared and if you are a horror fan (like I am) you should find plenty to like. By combining several different branches off the horror genre and using it to great effect, THE FOG is a cross between POLTERGEIST, HALLOWEEN and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD all rolled into one.<br /><br />So forget all of this CGI stuff for a minute and see what a true horror movie should really be like. THE FOG is simple yet deeply chilling and atmospheric. Follow it with Carpenter's ultimate classic (you know which movie I'm talking about) and double your pleasure.<br /><br />There's a reason why this low-budget shocker is so beloved by fans of the genre. Recommended.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5.</p></body></html>

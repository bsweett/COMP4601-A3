<meta name="summary" content="DISPOSABLE OVER-THE-TOP POPCORN FUN"></head><body><p>The film lives up loyally to its title, it's as barren as the Sahara. But if you're not expecting a meticulous rendition of Cussler's novel this is certainly a fun weekend caper. You have seen these fierce explosions and wild deus ex machina twists before, but that's what disposable action thrillers are about, aren't they?<br /><br />The adult cast may trick you into thinking the script was done by grown-ups too. Names like Dirk Pitt and the overall premise should swiftly dispel those suspicions -- an ironclad ship from the Civil War is buried beneath the sands of the Sahara, having ventured there 150 years ago but must now be found.<br /><br />Two diametrically opposed male leads are called to the task, one a six-pack toting macho stud and the other a shrimpy blunderbuss, but that doesn't a film make so we roll out a red mat for a Ms. Hotpants played by Penelope Cruz, who, surprise surprise, indulges in some choice moments with the macho man while saving the planet from a deadly nuclear chemical.<br /><br />I'm not surprised reviewers are drawing analogies to the other doozy thriller from recent memory, National Treasure, which at least played its cards with lilting pace.<br /><br />Yet I must admit that for all its obvious flaws this desert adventure doesn't suck as much as it could have. The Saharan context could have used more African influence on the soundtrack (which as it stands is a forgettable jumble of 70s rock) but at least it doesn't star Jean Claud Van Damme.<br /><br />That alone makes it worth the price of admission.</p></body></html>

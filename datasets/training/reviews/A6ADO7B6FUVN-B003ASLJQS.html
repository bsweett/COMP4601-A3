<meta name="summary" content="An Exceptionally Good Cinematic Experience"></head><body><p>Mystic River is a well-written story with well developed characters, several subplots, and an intriguing theme.  Eastwood brings out the drama through thorough character development by creating a connected history for the characters that continues throughout the film.  The cinematography is well balanced with terrific performances by the cast (including Tim Robbins, Sean Penn, Kevin Bacon, Laurence Fishburne and many others), which displays a realistic atmosphere.  This atmosphere creates a clash between the screen and the viewer as the story depicts some disturbing elements.  The disturbing elements provide a suspenseful tension that does not let go even after the end credits.<p>The story begins with one of the three main characters being kidnapped and molested as a child by two strangers.  This traumatic experience plays an essential role in the story as it connects the main characters and attributes to their personalities.  This attribution of personal characteristics pulls the audience into an unwanted, yet unavoidable direction.  Consequently, Mystic River offers an exceptionally good cinematic experience that will leave the audience pondering for a long time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Clearly the Best film I've seen in a long, long time."></head><body><p>The only things you want to know about "The Illusionist" are these.<br /><br />1. The fun of this movie is the mystery... So don't let anyone give you "spoiler" information.<br /><br />2. Although like every other movie, the fun of watching is in the suspending of disbelief, it is a movie that you have to pay attention to and think about. Watch it with someone, but no fair guessing out loud.<br /><br />3. My review. This is a very visual film; there is a great feeling of time traveling to the setting of the film. This is a very dark, sad and romantic story that you will want to watch again. This is a very smart and clever film that reaches out and drags you in, and the ending is...<br /><br />I won't tell!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An unbelievably shocking and moving moment of great cinema!"></head><body><p>I lack words for describing correctly the effect this movie made on me. I was shocked beyond what I can describe and consider "United 93" as one of the best real events description moments in cinema history.<br /><br />Paul Greengrass decided to make this film in a totally non-Hollywoodian style and he was dead right on target. No famous names, no Hollywood stars and some real air controllers who were in service on September 11 play themselves. The story keeps (as much as I can judge) strictly to the events of the day and there is no typically American alterations (no little girls waiting for transplantation, etc.). The events on board of United 93, the plane where passengers rebelled against the terrorists and stormed the cockpit, are described based on the real telephonic conversations, radio transmissions and the record from the black box. Some more conversations had to be added, but they fit very much to the rest of the story.<br /><br />The terrorists are very well described, including their leader (the pilot) who actually hesitates about ten minutes before giving the order of attack - it seems he was the only one of the attackers who was married and was leaving somebody behind. Even this is deduced from the real events, because United 93 was indeed hijacked later after the take off, than the three other planes. The fight on board of the plane is extremely ugly and realistic - no Hollywood usual stuff again.<br /><br />The incredible conversations between the military air defence command and the Supreme Headquarters of the US Air Force are one of the high points of the movie, with the general in charge begging desperately for a permission to shoot the hijacked planes before learning, that the two fighters that he managed to send in the air on such a short notice are unarmed... etc, etc. This is a great, great description of a great tragedy and possibly the best illustration of the proverbial "fog of war" I ever seen.<br /><br />As one of the previous reviewers, me too I do not think I will ever see this movie again - not because it is bad, but because it is SOOOOO good. Be warned - this is a masterpiece, but it is heartbreaking and the tension is almost unsufferable...</p></body></html>

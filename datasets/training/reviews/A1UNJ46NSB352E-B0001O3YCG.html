<meta name="summary" content="Richard B. Riddick, Escaped Convict, Murderer."></head><body><p>Oh, the joy that is Pitch Black.  It starts out in space, with a voice-over by Vin Diesel.  All you know about him is that he's a criminal being transported.  Suddenly, the confusion starts...the ship is being hit by something, and a crash landing is necessary.  The first huge moral dilema is presented within the first four or five minutes of the film.  It is brilliant because it sets the tone for the rest of the movie.  Cole Hauser plays Johns, the man in charge of transporting Riddick...he's concerned only about his payday.  There's Jack, the young boy running away from something, and Imam and his students/proteges, on a trip to New Mecca.<p>The fun really begins when they finally find some water...and realize they're not alone on the planet.  The planet goes dark for the first time in 22 years, and the creatures come out for some feeding.  Survivors start getting picked off one by one, internal debates heat up, and you really wonder what Riddick will do...or even Johns, for that matter.  I love movies where there's no clear-cut &quot;hero&quot; character.  We all have our flaws, and they are all on display in this movie.<p>The DVD presentation is fantastic.  The picture and sound quality are top-notch.  There's not as much behind-the-scenes stuff as you might want, but this movie was made years ago on a small, $20 million budget.  The best special feature is the commentary by Twohy, Cole Hauser, and Vin Diesel.  They give a lot of cool insights into the film, discuss what they think worked and didn't work, and what they tried to add to the film.  I highly recommend this DVD.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This is one of the most stupid thrillers ever."></head><body><p>Let me just say, that is dismal, this is horrible. This is a waste of Robert Deniro's talents and Dakota Fanning's talents, They have worked long and hard and made great movies and they make this crap? Well, I hate this movie with a passion. I thought it was boring, it had no scares, thrills, nudity, or any cussing. It should be G for god sakes, It was not that scary as People are saying it was. I felt that the critics kissed it too much by comparing it to the likes of Pyscho and The Shining(???).<br /><br />The movie stars Robert Deniro as David Callaway, a psychologist, who witnesses with his only daughter, the brutal suicide of his wife. So, He decides to go to some woods and start fresh with his daughter,Emily(Dakota Fanning). Then David starts seeing signs in the bathroom that somebody knows that what he has done and his Daughter all the sudden, has this playmate named Charlie. Then the problems get worse, Emily tries to scare off Elizabeth, who Emily thinks is replacing her mother, with the grusome details of her mom's sucide, and David doesn't condone it and tries to talk to her and see who is making her act this way, she says her imaginary friend Charlie. Charlie isn't your ordinary run of the mill imaginary friend. He is a sick demented fake person that is making all the signs and killing off the family cat and David's girlfriend.<br /><br />by the way, you will be pissed at the ending, I was too, and The trailer(if you have seen it), reveals too much about ending. I do not recommend this movie because it was just bad, and I hated it for not taking its potential and using it. such a shame.</p></body></html>

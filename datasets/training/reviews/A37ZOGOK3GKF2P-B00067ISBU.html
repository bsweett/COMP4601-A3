<meta name="summary" content="Extended 'Hellboy' Loaded With Extras"></head><body><p>The 3 disc set, loaded with extras is well worth the extra money.  The extended scenes are blended in with the regular film, seemlessly added.  Some scenes I can see why they didn't make the cut.  Ususually for time constrants.  Still there are some extra scenes that are a treat.  They fill a small void that was in the theatrical version.  Fans can rejoice!  A sequel is coming.  The special effects are flawless, however I felt a bit overwhelmed by all the computer generated critters.  They were also kind of dull for monsters, but the action is aplenty.  Ron Pearlman is great as Hellboy.  He gives the character a human edge, and that helps greatly.  A good movie that could have been great, but still well worth the money.  Trade in the old PG13 version and buy this one.</p></body></html>

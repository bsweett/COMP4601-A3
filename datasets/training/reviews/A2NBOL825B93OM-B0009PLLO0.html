But we wanted to watch it, see it with our own eyes. Oliver Stone took this problem on his hands, and made a 3-hour movie featuring the Macedonian conqueror. Everything about Alexander is great. This movie, however, is terrible.<br /><br />For starters, the plot. A succession of battle scenes and love scenes. The battle scenes are usually good - after all we're talking about Oliver Stone, the man responsible for "Platoon" and "Born on the fourth of July". We expect great shots of ancient armies facing each other, volleys of arrows, misleading cavalry charges and sword-to-sword fights. We get all that. The love scenes, however, are simply ridiculous. Alexander looks like a - pardon my french - bitch in heat, always trying to get the prettiest boy into his bed. At one time he forgets himself, and then he gets married to a woman - at least she's beautiful, and the only actor/actress that shows talent in the entire movie - Rosario Dawson. In Alexander's time the concepts about sexuality were different, but Farrell plays him like a petty fag.<br /><br />Speaking of acting, there rarely could be a more miscast film than Alexander. Collin Farrell can be the though guy with a three-day beard on his face, but he could never be Alexander. In his shoes, the great general was turned into an effeminate, spoiled, overgrown brat, making faces and open-eyed. Anthony Hopkins was a complete bore as Ptolemy, trying to teach the audience a lesson. Congratulations, Oliver Stone, you were able to loose one of the greatest actors of the post-Olivier era in your movie. And now we get to the worst part. I fell in love with Angelina Jolie in "The bone collector", and I watch every movie she makes just for the sake of seeing her. But this time I can't keep my mouth shut. She's terrible as Alexander's mother, Olympias. And that accent - worse even than Kate Beckinsale's in "Van Helsing". Only those beautiful green eyes prevented me from throwing something at the screen when she was on.<br /><br />So, in the end, when Alexander dies and the movie is over, we feel greatful. There is, however, one extremely beautiful scene in the movie, one that is shown in the trailler, where Alexander's horse is facing an elephant, both of them standing in their hind legs. This scene elevated the rating of the movie in one star.<br /><br />Grade 3.5/10</p></body></html>

Here's a few random things that come to mind in no particular order: 1) Will Smith is an uninteresting actor except for when he was in MEN IN BLACK and some other movie I can't remember the title of. 2) Bill Pullman is the president. 3) The president is one of the heros of the movie. LAME. Presidents are cowards and frauds that would hide in a bunker somewhere. 4) The plot is dumb and sucks; particularly the silly backstory between the president and Jeff Goldblum. 5) The name of the movie is lame. INDEPENDENCE DAY. Right. First we kicked British --- and now the aliens. America Rules!!! USA! USA! USA! America is saves the planet. The way the aliens are defeated- Lol! OK, "it's just a movie". It was a virus that destroyed them like in some other story about an alien invasion, but this time one for the alien's computers. "Star Wars" for the next generation I spot a reviewer claim?! SAY WHAT?? Sorry, that reviewer doesn't got a clue. And comparing it to STARSHIP TROOPERS? No, that is completely wrong. Saying this movie is better than STARSHIP TROOPERS is a complete misunderstanding of what STARSHIP TROOPERS was about. They didn't get it. STARSHIP TROOPERS is both a brilliant satire AND highly entertaining, well crafted sci-fi adventure flick in certain aspects masquerading as a B movie as well as perfect parody of WWII propaganda films. TROOPERS lightheartedly calls the viewer's attention to the propensity of propagandized humans for senseless violence without conscience, comicly using a war of humans versus mindless, souless, agressive "bugs" to make the point. Stuff that works: I like seeing the White House explode and other stuff. The alien ships look pretty cool.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Greek family fun"></head><body><p>Nia Vardalos turned her stand-up comedy routine about her own Greek wedding into a fun, family movie. You don't have to be Greek to recognize the eccentric relatives in her family; her parents, siblings, aunts, uncles, and cousins all insist she marry one of her own kind and make babies. However, she falls for a non-Greek (John Corbett) and they make it work. The story follows her engagement, the wedding preparations, his religious conversion, and the wedding. She starts the movie looking like an ugly duckling, but love makes her beautiful, as well as happy.<p>Everyone has at least one relative like Nia's and you can laugh and cry with her. The humor is all clean and it's two hours of solid laughs. Surprisingly enjoyable.</p></body></html>

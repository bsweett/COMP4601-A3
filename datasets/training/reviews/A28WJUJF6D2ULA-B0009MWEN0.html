Starship Troopers has the feel of the best of 1950's Saturday matinee sci-fi serials, updated for the 1990's. It is an interesting movie, has a good plot, has enough action to hold almost anyone's attention (in fact I'm informed Starship Troopers has more shots fired in its run-time than any film ever made...) and is enjoyable end-to-end. As someone told me and as I put in my title up there, if you haven't seen it, you probably should.</p></body></html>

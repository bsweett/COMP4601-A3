I'll just say it's a pure and moving moment richly earned.  As far as the movie goes as a whole, it deserves the hype.  I was really skeptical when I heard Eastwood won over Scorcese's Aviator.  But now, after seeing both, I think there's no question that the Academy made the right choice.  "The Aviator" is often breathtaking, but also very uneven.  "Million Dollar Baby" is one tight package.  For those upset over Scorcese missing out again (and from what I understand, Eastwood himself was uneasy over the comparisons), put it to rest.  Eastwood, as a director, has grown - perhaps now, brick by brick, film by film, beyond the great Scorcese.  Who'd of thunk it?<br /><br />What can one say about Eastwood?  Recently I watched again "Unforgiven," and I was struck by the power of that movie (which also has Morgan Freeman).  Eastwood's growth as a director is one of the great quiet stories of Hollywood.  As an exercise watch the horrible "Gauntlet" or even the "Outlaw Josie Wales," and then watch the trifecta of "Mystic River," "Unforgiven," and now "Million Dollar Baby."  What an astounding evolution!  Somewhere along the way Eastwood discovered that people matter - and moviegoers want to care about the people on the screen. And how he does it?  By focusing on character - and the heart.  Hillary Swank is a perfect example, with her heartbreaking performance as Maggie Fitzgerald, the toothy waitress with a right hook, who dares to dream of a life beyond her dreary existence. You are rooting for her despite the odds. Freeman - what a pro, he plays off of Eastwood in such a way that elevates both characters.  Eastwood's own performance as curmudgeony Frankie Dunn is simply one of his best - and should of netted him a best actor award.  But it's tough when people still see you as the Man with No Name.  Anyway, it's time to start looking at Eastwood as a throwback to the great American directors John Ford and Frank Capra. "Million Dollar Baby" and "Unforgiven" are American fables in the truest sense.  Right down to that lemon pie.</p></body></html>

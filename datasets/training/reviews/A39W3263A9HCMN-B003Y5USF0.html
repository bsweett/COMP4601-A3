Basically, movie after movie was a disaster movie most of them being brainless (yet silly nonetheless). It wasn't until "Twister" got released that there was finally a be all end all of disaster movies, and it was a summer smash. I, at 6 years old, was too young to watch it in the theatre, but I remember seeing the trailers on TV. And when it got released on VHS, my parents made a mad dash out to buy the video.<br /><br />This was one of my childhood favorites. I used to watch it a lot, even to the point where the videotape was worn out so we'd have to buy a second tape. However as I got older I hadn't seen it as much, in fact I remember the last time I saw it before back in April was when I was 9 or something. I dunno how this detachment suddenly happened, but who knows.<br /><br />Cut to April 2010. I'm in HMV to buy Avatar on blu-ray, and when I reach the "T" section, guess what movie I find? That's right, Twister. I had no idea the classic was out on  blu, and so I rushed it and Avatar to the counter to suddenly buy. It was only 7.99 too! And watching it for the first time on blu was a real nostalgic rush. Oh, the memories...<br /><br />Basically this nothing more than a cliche fest with special effects, but hey, it's done well, to the point where you're too busy having fun to even notice the cliches. It has a great cast including Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt not to mention Cary Elwes, a FANTASTIC soundtrack (I loved the usage of Tori Amos near the beginning!), tornadoes, great special effects and is overall just really fun to watch. And who could forget the scene where they are inside the tornado near the end?<br /><br />The blu-ray transfer is actually very good. The video quality is pretty good, not great though- not a whole lot of depth, but at least colors are good, and Oklahoma looks pretty. The audio... holy cripe, I had to keep checking outside my window to see if there was a tornado! It is THAT good. Debris hitting the windsheild, a house rolling onto a road having been torn from its foundation, and an exploding tanker truck has never sounded so lovely before. I swear, this is THE ultimate audio experience if you want some good disaster fun.<br /><br />Overall, if you've never seen Twister, put the disc in the player, crank up that sound system of yours, and just sit back and enjoy the ride. Don't pay attention to the negativity from people who don't know how to have fun and watch a movie. Just expect a fun filled Tornado flick, and try not to get too paranoid about tornadoes hitting your area!</p></body></html>

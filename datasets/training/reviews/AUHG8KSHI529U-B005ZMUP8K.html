This movie is an amazing amount of fun.  It has adventure, fresh takes on the pirate and sea story genre, has some wonderfully creepy villains, has some laugh out loud hilarity, and is even touching at times.  It is one of the most fun movies I have seen in quite awhile.  I recommend it to everyone who likes to have fun watching movies.  And it is a decent family film, but NOT for young children.  The PG-13 rating makes sense because some of the creepy / frightening moments are even effective for adults.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the first movie, I would suggest you see it before you see this one.  It isn't absolutely required, but you will know the characters in a way this films assumes you do when it opens.  The movie opens with Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and his lady love, Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightley) being arrested by Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander).  They are to be hanged for helping Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) escape in the first movie.  I don't want to go into the plot any more than this because every detail of it is so much fun to discover for the first time.  Let me just say that you will not expect or predict much of what happens in this movie.  Even when you think you know what is going to happen, what actually is put on the screen is fresh and that goes for the sound of the movie, as well.<br /><br />Even the Capt. Jack Sparrow of Johnny Depp is given new twists and depths and delights.  Sure, there is the Keith Richards aspect, but then there is the shish kabob.  You will have to see it to believe what you are seeing.  I do want to praise Bill Nighy for being able to bring so much expression to Davy Jones behind that octopus mask.  That is not easy to pull off, but he does.<br /><br />This is a movie worth seeing several times.</p></body></html>

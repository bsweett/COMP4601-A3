<meta name="summary" content="a knock out film"></head><body><p>i have seen many movies but this makes the top five. it is so juicy, so entertaning, so mezmerizing, so hilarious and so damn cool, its a full blown movie section its self. this is defenatly Tarantino's block buster film that made him into the director he is. this film is about two hit men, there bosses wife, and a boxer who all meet there fates in 48 hours. its all jigsawed up and it takes you a couple to times wacthing it to get the picture but its still entertaining. so the hit men story tells of them picking up a briefcase with something very valubale in it that we don't see but know that is pulp, then they cover up a murder, and finaly get cought up in a resturant heist. the bosses wife story goes on a date with one of the hit men, gets herself almost killed, and get stabbed in the heart to save her from dying ( a little confusing but just wacht the movie) the boxer story is about the guy who is paid to throw a fight, ends up killing the guy, gets kiddnaped and almost raped, and rides of with his wife. all these storys are intuined into one 152 long movie that just blows your mind. so if you want to see the 1990's movie that brought back the story telling gernes like the godfather, bonnie and clyde, the exorcist, and ben hur, then go see pulp fiction, one of the greatest movies made.</p></body></html>

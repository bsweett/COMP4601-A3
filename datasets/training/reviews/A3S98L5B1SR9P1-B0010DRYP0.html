<meta name="summary" content="The greatest mob film of all time!"></head><body><p>First things first, this movie is not overrated. If you want to see an overrated crime film, watch Scarface (the movie that every 13 year old rap fan seems to salivate over after seeing their favorite rapper display his/her copy on MTV's "Cribs"). I'm a big fan of Robert De Niro (he's my favorite actor) and Martin Scorsese (my favorite director next to Stanley Kubrick), so this movie was a true treat. The film is based on the real life gangster Henry Hill.<br /><br />This film is very memorable by top class performances by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, but Ray Liotta steals the show. There are only two movies on organized crime that you need to see. The Godfather and Goodfellas. Goodfellas brilliantly and according to many real goodfellas, accurately depicts mob life. In my opinion,  this is a true 5 star film. From the screenplay to the acting to the directing, it's a masterpiece of filmmaking. It just seems as though everyone in the movie is custom fit to their role. Very, very few films achieve that. So many memorable lines and scenes, its too many to list. I know this review doesn't say much, but trust me, this movie is a must see!<br /><br />- Zack, 16 years old</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Cast / Story(s) / Music / Dialogue - It Has It All..."></head><body><p>This ground breaking movie has been endlessly discussed, praised, damned, ripped off and copied so many times that you can easily lose sight of the fact that what you have here is a genuinely original, exciting and important work of art that when experienced for the umpteenth time STILL never fails to thrill and amuse. <p>This movie is one of the few I would describe as perfect. I honestly cannot fault a thing about it. The brilliant dialogue has become legendary, the elliptical structure of the script has been much imitated and will continue to do so. The fantastic group of actors, who range from has-beens (at the time) to cult favourites, are all uniformly excellent, and the soundtrack is one of the coolest and most eclectic ever assembled. In short, this is a modern classic, and required viewing for all movie fans. 'Pulp Fiction' is as good as any movie you care to name. To (mis)quote Flavor Flav - &quot;believe the hype!&quot;</p></body></html>

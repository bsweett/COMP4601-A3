Plus, it's a story I'd rather remember the way I visualized it while reading it than anything that would end up on film.  I wouldn't have given this movie a second thought if it hadn't been directed by Frank Darabont, who's probably the best at sticking to King's books.<br />The Mist is a story of a group of people stranded in a grocery store surrounded by a thick mist full of Lovecraftian beasties.  Of course when you get a group of people together in this kind of horror movie situation, they tend to fall into the usual cliched categories of good guys and bad guys.  It then becomes more of a character study of human behavior, and the outside threat becomes secondary.  It's a premise as old as Night of the Living Dead, but it's a premise I've always found fascinating.<br />All in all I thought the movie was good.  With a few minor exceptions, Darabont is pretty much letter perfect with the King story.  The acting was all around decent and the pacing was good.  My only real complaints come with the creatures.  I don't care what anyone says, fully computer generated monsters do not look good.  They look like something from a video game, and I think it's a cop out to use them.  Animatronic creatures with computer enhancements would have been good because it would at least look like something was actually there with the actors, yet fluid moving enough so it didn't look totally fake.<br />The big controversy about The Mist is the ending.  No one will shut up about, so I guess I won't either.  This is the biggest difference between the novella and the movie.  King left us with an open, "choose your own ending" type of ending for the story.  Darabont leaves us with a grim Twilight Zone type of ending.  Darabont's ending left a real bad taste in a lot of people's mouths(including my wife who complained about it for the rest of the friggin night, totally ruining her mood and depriving me of the nookie I thought I'd be receiving.  Thanks, Frank!).  Of course if Darabont had used King's ending, people would have been whining about that too coz it robs the audience of the closure they so desperately need.  It's a true case of "damned if you do, damned if you don't".  I didn't hate Darabont's ending as much as most people did, though I didn't love it either.  I love the flipping of the bird to a Hollywood ending, we certainly need more of that kind of spirit in big budget movies.  It does have it's lapses in logic though.  NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE SPOILER THAT YOU NO DOUBT ALREADY KNOW:  A suicide pact is formed and carried out way too abruptly.  Sure the situation seemed hopeless, but it could have been much more hopeless.  You think you'd hold off on such a life changing decision until it's absolutely down to the wire, especially if your friggin' son is concerned!!  Oh, well.  The film had already been on for about 2 hours at that point, so I guess Darabont just wanted to cut to the chase.  But I do like the suicide and what came afterwards, it's the final slap in the audience's face.  It was just way too abrupt to be remotely realistic.<br />Stephen King writes in his notes in Skeleton Crew that if The Mist were a film, it'd be low budget, in black and white and shown on a drive-in screen.  What a wonderful thought, what a wonderful dream.  Unfortunately in this day and age it will never happen that way.  But I do have to say that for today's state of horror films, The Mist is one of the best we'll see, and Darabont made this great King story probably the best it could have been made.</p></body></html>

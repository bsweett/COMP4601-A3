Lewis' allegory-laden works are more accessible, on many levels for children and church-folk. So, thus the Narnia audience is broader due to its mix of borrowed mythology and Christian imagery. This release is well timed, following the success of both the Harry Potter franchise and the Lord of the Rings "trilogy." Well-timed also because the limits of computer animation has been pushed far enough to reverently envision the world of NARNIA. But you still have to work with those darn child actors, or do you...hmm.<br /><br />  Narnia, unlike the Lord of the Rings' Middle-Earth, this fantasy-land never quite comes across as consistently real. The Special Effects are very mixed: the wolves are impressive and Aslan, voiced perfectly by Liam Neilson, seems infinitely more realistic than his BBC counterpart (which, many of the other creatures are rather, soulless. Some landscapes recreated on sound-stages and matte paintings are plainly artificial. While, some meshing of real and digital works. Some of these moments with the actors do not. New Zealand director Andrew Adamson, of Shrek 1 & 2, doesn't have much experience with live action movies, coming from a Special Effects background, and maybe the child actors are out of their depth when it comes to acting in front of a green-screen. A lot of "The Lord of the Rings" works because the actors convincingly interact with each other as well as with the real or illusion environment. In this film, that doesn't happen. The children are also awkward and foundering when asked to portray some of the more complicated scenes. But I am profoundly pleased that children were cast who look like real WWII evacs and not Sears models.  As for the adult talent, the Evil White Witch, as played by Tilda Swanson was perfect performance for the genre.<br /><br />The film's opening shares more character insights and background than Lewis himself does, foreshadowing Edmund's selfish nature. With a brief but intense air raid on London, leading to the emotional juxtaposition of the evacuation of children to the country. Both beautiful cinematic moments not in the original text. Other classic moments that were from the text, like Lucy finding the wardrobe, were a pleasure to watch.<br /><br />Then of course some of the problems lie with the original material, Lewis' book. The Narnia series is heavy on allegory and a mix of global myths in the fantasy world without any important dramatic justification unlike Tolkien's work. While such a miscellaneous fairy-world work in print or in children's minds, it certainly is difficult to portray on screen without appearing hackneyed to today's audiences. "Chronicles" had been promoted as "a Lord of the Rings for kids" this is misleading. It may have been the intention of its makers, but not the end product.<br /><br />But in the end it is a FINE big screen version of a fine book series with many magical moments and I hope it does well enough in theaters and on DVD to warrant more films.</p></body></html>

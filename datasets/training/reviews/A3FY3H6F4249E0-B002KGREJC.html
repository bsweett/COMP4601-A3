<meta name="summary" content="A 16-year old's pregnancy story"></head><body><p>I saw this one in the theater, quite by accident.  I took my 15-year old granddaughter to the movies and she said, "Let's see Juno.  I heard it was really good."  I had no idea what it was about.  As the movie started, a 16-year old girl was talking about how she had had sex in a chair with this boy and I though, "Oh my God!  What have I done!"  Well, the movie was quite good, indeed.<br /><br />I believe Juno had sex one time with this boy from school who was about the same age, and, as we all know is quite possible, she got pregnant.  The movie takes you through the whole pregnancy:  how Juno's life changed throughout the pregnancy, decisions she had to make, how she told her parents, should they get married, should she have an abortion, should she keep the baby, should she put it up for adoption? and so many other related issues.  The movie delt with a very serious subject matter, but it did it well and in a non-judgemental way.  There was quite a bit of humor in the movie, but the humor did not diminish the seriousness of the subject.<br /><br />I was really surprised at how good this movie was.  The theater was loaded with teenagers, some with their boyfriends.  I like to hope that they all got a better appreciation of the responsibilities that come with sex from the movie that teens are not necessarily ready for.  Judging from the audience's reactions, I think it made them all think.  No one left making goofy remarks and laughing.  The show seemed to be attempting to show you the whole picture (like the domino principle) of all the people affected and how.  It did not seem to be condemning anyone either.  It was more like "OK.  I made a mistake.  I accept the consequences.  Now, my options are: x, y. z."<br /><br />And, yes, both my 15-year old granddaughter and her 59-year old grandmother enjoyed it very much.<br /><br />If you are trying to decide if you children should watch it:<br />1) They probably know WAY more already than you think they do;<br />2) They may have done some exploring already; and<br />3) This movie might give them a better perspective because it seems to speak their language.</p></body></html>

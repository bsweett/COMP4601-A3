Desperately Dewey assumes the name of his roommate and accepts a job as a substitute elementary school teacher for the states best private school.  However, Dewey has no interest in teaching, until he finds out that the students are exceptionally skilled with a number of musical instruments.  This leads to Dewey to initiate a secret school project that includes playing and learning about rock music.  School of Rock is an interesting comedy that displays how an exceptional teacher must love what he or she is teaching in order to engage his or her students.  Linklater grabs the audience in a very uplifting cinematic experience, which is full of wonderful jokes and shenanigans.  This film should be recommended viewing for teachers as it can salvage their desire to teach and help youth.</p></body></html>

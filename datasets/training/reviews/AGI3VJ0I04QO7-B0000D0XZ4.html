But mostly we are served up garbage like Spiderman and Daredevil (shudders). The Hulk of course is a full blown classic comic book hero, done very seriously in a real world setting (like they tried to do with X Men with mixed results). It really works here too. Of cuorse its quite a slow movie but I dont have A.D.D so I can sit through and enjoy the beautiful cinematography as the story slowly unfolds. Needless to say there is a huge payoff at the end with the most amazing CG character I have seen since the first Jurassic Park (and I hate CGI usually) battling it out with the United States Army. I was however a little dissapointed with Eric Bana who has been great in some other movies, but I felt he was a little wooden in this film. Also the final confrontation between Bana and Nolte turned intoa SFX nightmare. The rest of the films look, music and atmosphere were amazing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Hugo" is brilliant!"></head><body><p>"Hugo" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Hugo is a wily and resourceful boy whose quest to unlock a secret left to him by his father will transform him and all those around him, and reveal a safe and loving place he can call home.<br /><br />The cast led by Ben Kingsley (as Georges Melies), Sacha Baron Cohen (as the Station Inspector), Asa Butterfield (as Hugo) & Chloe Grace Moretz (as Isabelle) is brilliant. The directing by Martin Scorsese (who also produced) is brilliant. The screenplay (based on the book "The Invention Of Hugo Cabret" by Brian Selznick) by John Logan is brilliant.<br /><br />The music by Howard Shore is brilliant. The cinematography by Robert Richardson is brilliant. The film editing by Thelma Schoonmaker is brilliant. The casting by Ellen Lewis is brilliant. The production design by Dante Ferretti is brilliant. The art direction by Alastair Bullock, Dimitri Capuani, Steve Carter, Stephane Cressend, Martin Foley, Christian Huband, Stuart Rose, Luca Tranchino, David Warren & Ashley Winter is brilliant. The set decoration by Francesca Lo Schiavo is brilliant. The costume design by Sandy Powell is brilliant.<br /><br />This is a terrific and well-done, well-made film that is entertaining and well-crafted. This movie will keep your mind thinking throughout the film. Martin Scorsese has directed another masterpiece of a film under his belt, a film that is a terrific change of pace, even for him. This is one of the best films of the holiday season and of the year, as well. A film that is worthy of awards consideration.</p></body></html>

And then the violence begins. Say what you might about the &quot;excessive violence&quot;, the gore and blood in this film are really NOT that bad when you put it up next to something like NATURAL BORN KILLERS or FIRE WALK WITH ME. Violence is the only thing those two movies have going for them. RESERVOIR DOGS strives for something more.<p>On the surface, this is a crime film about a gang of jewelry store robbers trying to discover who the &quot;rat in the house&quot; is: the snitch who made a very bloody mess of the heist. But on a second level, it is also about honor among thieves which does exist here. This gang is full of cut-throats who would have successfully pulled off the heist if it weren't for the snitch. And the snitch is NOT a crook, he's an undercover cop. On a third level, it's a story about simple friendships and trust.<p>This is an amazing film filled with powerful performances, especially from Harvey Keitel and Steve Buschemi. All the performances for that matter are great. The movie, which is mostly set in one location, has a claustrophobic feel; but the flashbacks which are mostly set outdoors, give us breathing room. Q.T. has given us an unusual, and unusually humorous, look into the world of men who happen to be criminals, and into the world of criminals who happen to be friends. Get this movie!</p></body></html>

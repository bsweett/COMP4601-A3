<meta name="summary" content="Maybe The Best of the Series"></head><body><p>It would really be tough to top the previous movies in this series, but LFODH may have done it.<br /><br />This one involves a group of cyber terrorists who inflict widespread chaos on the nation in numerous ways.  The mayhem unleashed is mindboggling.<br /><br />In this installment, John McClane (Bruce Willis) teams up with young hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long) to try to stop the widespread damage being inflicted by Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) and his group of evil computer gurus.  Gabriel and his band are great villains and McClane is his usual top notch self in fighting the bad guys.<br /><br />Action fans will love this one.  Although the action is completely farfetched at times, it is still a fun time.  It may be necessary to suspend one's sense of reality for this show, but it is worth it.  This is really a great show.</p></body></html>

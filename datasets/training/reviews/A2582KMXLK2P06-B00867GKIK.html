Hey I guess that makes me a big kid for watching it, lol.<br /><br />It's about an old man who takes a special journey to South America to visit a place he and his wife talked about visiting while the wife was alive.  Well after the wife finally dies, the old man decides to take the journey himself by actually lifting his house off the ground by way of thousands of floating balloons.<br /><br />It's funny because throughout the film, a crucial element to the storytelling is the old man constantly dragging his floating house around everywhere he goes, lol.  To join him on the adventure is a young boy scout looking for a badge that's awarded for helping the elderly.<br /><br />Is it just me or does the old man look almost identical to Joe Paterno, Penn State's football coach?  It's almost too hard to believe it's just a coincidence.  Back when I was watching previews of this film from the TV commercials last year, I could have sworn Disney actually designed the old man to look like Joe.  Maybe not...<br /><br />I don't know about anybody else, but the beginning segment involving the old man as a child and introducing himself to the woman who would turn out to be his wife is REALLY emotional and downright devastatingly sad.  I was seriously sitting there crying as the film quickly went through the motions of the man and woman starting out as children, then growing up and getting married, fixing up their house, not being able to have a baby, growing old, and eventually leading to the wife departing.  Maybe it's just me but the amount of sadness in this particular segment is really unbelievable.<br /><br />Upon landing in South America, the old man and the boy scout meet up with some animals and have the adventure of a lifetime.<br /><br />Up is a really good animated film for anyone looking to spend a little entertainment with their family.  I highly recommend it.  Just be warned when watching the first 10 minutes- make sure you have some tissues available, lol.  Really effectively well done bit of storytelling there.  Incredibly touching on so many levels.  The film never goes in *that* direction ever again.  Great movie.</p></body></html>

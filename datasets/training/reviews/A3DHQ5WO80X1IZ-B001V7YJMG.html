<meta name="summary" content="Forget 'Twilight' - this is the movie you have to see!"></head><body><p>You can call this a vampire movie. But its not like any other one that you've ever seen. Maybe a coming-of-age story. Or even a "two lonely outsiders find each other" story. It's all of those and more, and it's gonna make my "best of" list for 2008. This is a haunting, beautiful tale of two 12-year-olds - the boy is a loner who gets beaten up regularly by the school bully. The girl is a vampire who moves in next door. The feel of the movie almost reminds me of Sophia Coppola's 'The Virgin Suicides', with a beatiful melancholy to it. I don't want to hype it up too much, lest you be disappointed, but put this one at the top of your list.</p></body></html>

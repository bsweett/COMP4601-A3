<meta name="summary" content="The Sentinel"></head><body><p>President Ballentine (Rasche) has received serious assassination threats, and there just may be an inside man in the Secret Service.  David Breckinridge (Sutherland) and a new partner are chosen to investigate the case.  After polygraph tests, all signs point to Pete Garrison (Douglas), but the tests are showing false positives for other reasons.  Breckinridge and Garrison also used to be best friends until it seemed Garrison was having an affair with Breckinridge's wife.  Garrison now must go on the run to prove his innocence and convince Breckinridge that he is not the guilty party.<br /><br />"The Sentinel" is a fun, if predictable ride.  Douglas and Sutherland are in good form.  (Sutherland is channeling Jack Bauer of "24", and that is just fine).  The mystery surrounding the assassination attempt is interesting, but can be figured out fairly easily.  Still, there is enough action to keep things rolling smoothly.  "The Sentinel" is a good popcorn movie that will entertain.</p></body></html>

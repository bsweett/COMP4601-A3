Perlman is excellent in the titular role and the suppoting cast is strong throughout.  What really won me over though was the non-stop action and amazing FX.  They were some of the "cleanest" looking FX I have seen in quite some time (one major fight scene excluded).  ALso it is beautifully filmed - you could tell the director really took care with this project.  Highly entertaining and never dull - a great escapist movie.</p></body></html>

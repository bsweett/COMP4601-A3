<meta name="summary" content="Requiem for a Spleen (aka, Night of the Predatory Aliens)"></head><body><p>The Good Things:<br />-Definately more action, special effects, and gore.<br />-Predator has more goodies.<br />-Alien/Predator hybrid monster gets to wreak all sorts of havoc.<br />-For that matter, all of the creatures get to wreak all sorts of havoc.<br />-Even the military gets to blow some things up.<br />-This is the first time you get to see the predator homeworld.<br />-This is also the first time you get to see average people encountering aliens or predators (main characters are not military, spacemen, androids, commandos, explorers, or anything else fancy).<br />-At the very end, there is a reference to the Yutani group (which later merges with Wayland), thus continuing to correspond to the Alien saga.  Also leaves the movie open for a sequel.<br />-The rest of the film stays true to the original concepts of the Alien/Predator sagas.<br /><br />The Bad Things:<br />-Camera moves were shaky at some points, and lighting is very dark.  As a friend of mine pointed out, it makes it harder to actually see any of the aliens.<br />-Characters started off good, but seemed dull at the end, and many wound up dying.<br />-There is also no hero character as there is in all other Alien/Predator films (such as Ripley or Schwartzenegger's character).  You can only root for the Predator (or maybe the Alien...).<br />-Lots of senseless deaths.<br />-A few brutal parts (the aliens kill children, babies, and a pregnant woman).<br />-Some parts seemed ripped off (the ending reminded me of "Resident Evil:  Apocalypse", the story reminded me of "Dawn of the Dead," one part reminded me of "The Faculty," and other parts resembled the other Alien/Predator movies).<br /><br />This feels a lot less like Alien or Predator and more like "Dawn of the Dead." The focus for half of the movie is on a bunch of people who wind up as alien fodder.  The other half is the cool half, where the aliens are fighting (and there is plenty of fighting!).  It is good in a way, because it is more unique than the others (we finally get to see aliens trashing Earth).  It is also bad, because the film is dehumanized.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is a brainless action/horror flick.  I would reccomend it if you are looking for such a movie.  I reccomend it more to Alien/Predator fans (and perhaps fans of other brainless horror movies).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Paranoia and Gore - On Ice!"></head><body><p>More exiting than the vague title would suggest, J. Carpenter's infamous gore-fest is a finely crafted thriller featuring some of the most bizarre make-up effects ever captured on celluloid.<br /><br />Situated in a remote arctic research facility, the film follows Kurt Russel and his colleagues as they battle against an extraterrestrial horror they inadvertently unearthed from a glacier.<br /><br />This 'thing', whatever it is, can take any shape it wants, leading to frequently bloody creature transformations. As the movie progresses the creatures get weirder and more grotesque, an impressive feat considering that it was accomplished without any computer special effects.<br /><br />The relative lack of cheesy dialogue and complete absence of female nudity (or females altogether) are notable departures from the standard format of the genre. This gives the film more time to explore the evolution of suspicion and paranoia between the researchers, as well as the desperate acts of self-preservation that ultimately result.<br /><br />An excellent film with very few weak moments. A worthy 'collectors' edition with tons of extras including an 80 minute making of movie, commentary, deleted scenes and more! Highly Recommended.</p></body></html>

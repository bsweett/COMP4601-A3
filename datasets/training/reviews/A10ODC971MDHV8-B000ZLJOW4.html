<meta name="summary" content="Ghost World"></head><body><p>An inspired take on adolescent alienation and angst, Zwigoff's "Ghost World"--adapted from the graphic novel by Daniel Clowes--is a clever and quirky character piece. The three leads are great, but Ileanna Douglas almost steals the film as eccentric art teacher Roberta, who pushes Enid to realize her creative talents. Yes, "Ghost World" is funny, but there's also wisdom and heart behind the laughs.</p></body></html>

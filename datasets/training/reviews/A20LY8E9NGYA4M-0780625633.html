<meta name="summary" content="A POWERFUL MOVIE WITH STRONG PERFORMANCES."></head><body><p>&quot;American History X&quot; tells the story of Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton), a neo-nazi leader of a skinheads gang of Venice Beach, California. Derek is introduced as a racist scumbag in the first scene, when he kills a couple of black men in front of his younger brother Danny (Edward Furlong); Derek is sent to prison and Danny gets so impressed with the actions of his older brother that he decides to follow his footsteps as a radical racist.<br /><br /> Then the movie is divided in two kind of scenes: the black and white scenes, the flashbacks, where we can see the past of Derek, his thoughts about every person which is different to a white American person, he hates black people, Jews, Mexicans, Asiatic people, etc., he just hates them all. And then are the color scenes, the present, where we see a new Derek, a reformed Derek, he is now ashamed of his racist past, and now he has to fight to save his brother of following his footsteps.<br /><br /> &quot;American History X&quot; is not a popcorn movie; is a powerful drama with strong scenes, strong language, and a very disturbing ending; it requires an open mind because the subjects that the story introduces to us may be controversial.<br /><br /> Edward Norton is incredible as Derek, in this movie he offers his best performance so far, and that's saying a lot. In &quot;American History X&quot; he is as impressive as Robert De Niro was in &quot;Raging Bull&quot; or as Daniel Day-Lewis was in &quot;Gangs Of New York&quot;. The rest of the cast is also perfect in this movie, particularly Edward Furlong as Danny. The extras on the DVD are not very good, but one of the deleted scenes is very interesting.<br /><br /> Perhaps &quot;American History X&quot; may offend some people, but open minded people will appreciate better this movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Making A Dishonest Living"></head><body><p>CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, the latest opus so far from the cinema's greatest living director Steven Spielberg, is a highly inventive crime caper movie based on real life.<p>Leonardo DiCaprio portrays Frank Abagnale, a kid from Long Island who ran away from a broken home and worked his way to riches by impersonating everyone from airline pilots to doctors to lawyers and forging checks to the tune of $4 million during a three-year spree in the 1960s.  Tom Hanks, reliable as always, portrays Carl Hanratty, the FBI man hot on his trail from coast to coast who eventually tracks him down in France.  The process by which DiCaprio is able to manage not only to forge checks but also his own identity is done with considerable wit and humor; and the cat-and-mouse game between him and Hanks closely resembles Hitchcock at his prime.<p>Spielberg obviously identified with Abagnale and his saga, since the director himself told some pretty tall tails in his youth to break into Hollywood, including lying about his age.  As a result, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, like a lot of Spielberg's work, has a deep personal resonance to it.  But Spielberg also devotes time to Hanks' FBI agent's dilligence in pursuing the elusive Abagnale.  The film's witty title sequence, made to look like the film itself was actually made in the early 1960s, and John Williams' jazzy score (in the manner of Henry Mancini's great film scores from the 60s), prove to be the icing on the cake.<p>Long and deliberately paced but never dull, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is one of the best films of 2002, and yet another great movie in the Spielberg canon.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="EXCELLENT HORROR FILM !"></head><body><p>Greg McLean's "Wolf Creek" is a masterful addition to the backwoods horror genre. Destine for horror greatness & much more factual than Tobe Hooper's 1974 landmark horror film "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" wich is loooosely based on "the ghoul of plainfeild" Ed Gein. McLean's film is about one (mostly real) incident in wich a man named Ivan Robert Milat aka "The Wolf Creek Killer" or "The Back Pack Killer" who was found guilty of killing 7+ back packer's between 1989-92 in aultralia's back woods in & around a national park called wolfcreek this is just one of the stories & it is truly scary! enjoy!</p></body></html>

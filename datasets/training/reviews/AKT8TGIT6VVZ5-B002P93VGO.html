<meta name="summary" content="Good, Not Great, X-Men Film"></head><body><p>There are really two good reasons to watch "X-Men Origins: Wolverine"; Hugh Jackman and Liev Schreiber as, respectively, Wolverine and Sabretooth. Schreiber's performance is especially noteworthy since he's probably the best villain I have seen in an X - Men film since Ian McKellen's wicked, quite twisted, take on Magneto. Indeed, in almost every scene, Schreiber almost steals the spotlight from Jackman. Replete with great action adventure sequences, this film sags a bit in discussing the origins of Wolverine and his conflicted relationship with his half-brother Sabretooth, whom we meet first in the desolate wildnerness of Canada's Northwest Territories, sometime in the mid 1840s (We see next a thrilling montage of both brothers servicing in the USA's armed forces from the Civil War through Vietnam and beyond.). Another compelling reason to see "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" is Danny Huston's creepy performance as Colonel Stryker, who finds himself as both mentor and sinister overlord to both X-Men. Have no doubt that diehard fans of the "X-Men" series will enjoy this film, especially for the fine screen chemistry between Jackman and Schreiber, but I also suspect that those unfamiliar with this classic comic book series may feel a bit underwhelmed.</p></body></html>

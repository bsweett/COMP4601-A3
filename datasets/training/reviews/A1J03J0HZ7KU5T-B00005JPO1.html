<meta name="summary" content="Indy's Back!"></head><body><p>A return to the Saturday matinee thrills of yesteryear, with Harrison Ford in terrific form and some memorable set-pieces courtesy of director Steven Spielberg. Despite a slow midsection, "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" (2008) is a more satisfying adventure than "Temple of Doom." Ford manages to hold the film together, but why do producers shove nonentities such as Shia LaBeouf down our throats? Luckily, there is Cate Blanchett's villainy, Ray Winstone's comic relief and Karen Allen's spirited reappearance as Marion Ravenswood. The formula still works and a fourth sequel would be welcome - minus LaBeouf.</p></body></html>

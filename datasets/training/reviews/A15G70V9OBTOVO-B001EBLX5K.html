<meta name="summary" content="The funniest movie ever made........not."></head><body><p>Borat has its moments but it takes the same wrong turn that you see in Michael Moore's movies.  It makes some serious, even grim points but does it in such a way you almost feel sympathy for the victims.  And then there is the vulgarity (some of which is very funny) which essentially takes away any chance of getting a message across.<br /><br />Yes, this country has many very backward people and as far as I know, none were coached to say what they did.  But is it really that entertaining to make fun of them?  Surprisingly, no.  Politicians, of course are fair game.<br /><br />I'll say one thing.  The guy has balls.  And I saw a lot more of them than I cared to.</p></body></html>

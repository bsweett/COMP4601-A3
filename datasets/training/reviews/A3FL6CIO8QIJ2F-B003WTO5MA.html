<meta name="summary" content=""An Excellent Remake Of A Hollywood Classic""></head><body><p>Michael Bay, who produced the remakes of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "The Fog", redid this amazing version of 1979's "Amityville Horror". The film recounts the haunting true story of how a family purchases a dream home, unknowing that a man killed his own entire family there. Once this new family moves in a series of unexplained events start happening with the father experiencing psychotic behavior to his loved ones. Hunk Ryan Reynolds (who has the best-looking abs of any actor I have seen) and Melissa George star as the leads.<br /> The film would go on to be the #1 movie in its opening weekend encompassing over 23 million dollars at the boxoffice. So far the movie has made over 100 million! Needless to say "The Amityville Horror" has become a certifed hit, although many critics have panned the film.<br /> The DVD features deleted scenes, Ryan Reynolds and producers commentary, featurettes on the making of the film, and more. The movie is in anamorphic widescreen, is 89 minutes long, and english, french, and spanish subtitles are included.</p></body></html>

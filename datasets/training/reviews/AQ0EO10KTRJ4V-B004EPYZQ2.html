<meta name="summary" content="Had potential for 5 stars, but faded into an ET clone at end"></head><body><p>As everybody knows by now, SUPER 8 was kind of a homage to Spielberg film by Abrams,<br /><br />At the beginning, I was liking it much more than I expected and was really enjoying the 70's era vintage vibe and the story of young kids ................. BUT ............... as the movie went along it became clear it was TOO CLOSE to being a thinly disguised remake of E.T.<br /><br />This became less of a homage and more of a "by the numbers" plot re-work bordering on a flagrant remake with a slightly darker tone.<br /><br />Up until the 50 minute mark, I felt SUPER 8 was going to be a 4.5- 5.0 star movie, but from about 55 minutes onwards it started to fall apart and fade and lost its charm and became basically gave up trying to even disguise the fact it was remaking E.T.<br /><br />As with most critics of the film, the last 10 minutes (ENDING) was very weak and falls flat compared to the rest of the the film.<br /><br />The kid actors (and other actors) did a great job.<br />The set and wardrobe people did a great job.<br /><br />As mentioned above ...... for the first 2/3 of the movie, it was on track to be almost a 5 star rating ............. but then it became TOO FORMULAIC and predictable and seemed TOO CLOSE to E.T. and many other similar movies.<br /><br />Also the last 1/3 of the movie is where the plot holes became very obvious and the logic of the plot falls apart with inconsistencies.<br /><br />Entertaining to watch and much respect for those who worked on the film, but not one we will add to our DVD collection or ever watch again in the future.</p></body></html>

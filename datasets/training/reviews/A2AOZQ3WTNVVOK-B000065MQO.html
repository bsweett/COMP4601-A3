The catalyst for change was the Viet Nam War. On the one hand, we had a society that was chafing under the paradigms of the 1950s, and the residual effects of the black and white world which we tried to create in the aftermath of World War II and the ascendancy of communism. On the other hand, we had a generation looking to change the way we perceive the world, including how we look at enemies, and whether some people were really our enemies. In some ways the Viet Nam War became a surreal alternate reality where our soldiers received a huge cultural shock leaving the relatively cloistered Disneyland of America. The difficulty becomes capturing not the reality of Viet Nam, but the feeling of Viet Nam. Stanley Kubrick did exactly that with "Full Metal Jacket."<br /><br />There are two portions to this movie, with the second part of the movie having sub-parts. In the first portion of the movie we meet the principal character we will follow into Viet Nam, Private J.T. "Joker" Davis. Joker is the observer of the indoctrination of new Marine recruits, where pampered civilian sons are turned into fighting men. R. Lee Ermey established a milestone in military character portrayals by his role as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. He is mean and tough, but he is that way because he knows that the reality of war requires mean and tough men. Unfortunately, Private Leonard "Gomer Pyle" Lawrence (chillingly played by Vincent D'Onofrio) is unable to tolerate the stress of indoctrination, and snaps in a very violent, shocking, way. Thus ends basic training and Private Joker's transition to Viet Nam.<br /><br />The transition from basic training to Viet Nam is instantaneous, with no discussion of the aftermath of Private Gomer Pyle's actions. However, as I pointed out earlier, consider the shock that these young men faced as they went from the black and white, sheltered life of a citizen of the United States to a corrupt country where death was around every corner. The culture shock is difficult to convey, and yet the disorientation in the transition from the first part of the movie to the second part makes a good attempt at having the audience experience the feeling, even if it is in a relatively benign way.<br /><br />The second part of the movie explores what happens when people who have been exposed only to American culture are faced with the reality of combat. Private Joker must confront combat and the result of combat head on while being a pacifist at his core. However, even his peaceful nature can not stand by while a vengeful and ferocious enemy is killing his comrades. Private Joker is faced with mass graves and the reality of a war of attrition and the senseless violence of some Americans, though the enemy was just as ruthless when the opportunity arose.<br /><br />The movie uses the 1968 Tet Offensive as a backdrop for a series of intense combat scenes leading up to a confrontation between Private Joker's squad and an unseen enemy. The violence in this series of scenes is graphic and simultaneously poignant. Death in combat is never pretty, and Stanley Kubrick did his best to depict combat death in all its horrific detail. If anyone is tempted to glorify combat this movie should be mandatory watching.<br /><br />The final scene in this movie is a confrontation between Private Joker and an enemy sniper. The confrontation is incredible because of the complexity of the numerous feelings. There is fear. There is the sudden realization that the enemy is only a little different from us; young and frightened. There is the desire to not have to kill the enemy, to wish that circumstances could be otherwise. There are more feelings, many more, for an empathetic viewer.<br /><br />Knowledgeable viewers will not mistake "Full Metal Jacket" for a documentary, or even being more than passingly factual. What this movie does do is give viewers the feeling of the era, the feeling of being a soldier in a war that many, and perhaps ultimately most, in America did not want to fight. This war helped America realize that World War II was not happening again, that black and white was gray, and that we too were different, though we were realizing it all too slowly. Of all the Viet Nam War related movies that I have watched, and I have seen all but one of significance, this movie seems to me to best portray how we felt as the 60s came to an end, whether we like to remember that feeling or not.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Beautiful and stirring, but surprisingly mechanical and eventually empty...."></head><body><p>"Super 8" is to late 70s/early 80s Steven Spielberg fare what the Black Crowes are to Altamont-era Rolling Stones, or what the first Lenny Kravitz album is to "Magical Mystery Tour"-era Beatles.<br /><br />Which is to say, hugely influenced by it.<br /><br />But when a movie owes as much as "Super 8" does to other artistic creations ... can it really be considered its own thing?<br /><br />Critics were saying that after "Mission: Impossible III" and the recently rebooted "Star Trek" movie, J.J. Abrams was finally attempting something that wasn't a remake. But both "M:I3" and "Star Trek" took something old and made it wildly new (I'm an enthusiastic fan of both of those films), while "Super 8" is so entirely beholden to "Jaws," "Close Encounters...," "The Goonies," "Gremlins" and "Amazing Stories" that it feels like a big step backward for Abrams.<br /><br />The child actors are superb, the story has weight and the look is beautiful and stirring ... but the movie so busy spinning plates and hurling curveballs that I doubt I'll watch again. On the other hand, I rarely tire of vintage Spielberg.</p></body></html>

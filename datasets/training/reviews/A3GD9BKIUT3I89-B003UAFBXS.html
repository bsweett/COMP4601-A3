What more does one have to say?  It is a riot.  An Egyptian Mummy who comes to a rest home and begins killing it's residents -- and only Elvis and JFK (Ossie Davis) can stop it!  Elvis in a walker -- he threw out his hip with a karate kick.  It's common for people to tell you everything about the film to the point where you ask yourself, "Why see it?  I know everything."  So I won't.  Based on a story by Texas author Joe R. Lansdale (whom I have met, a damned nice guy from Nagagoches, Texas who always runs an Akido school -- "I call it my whoop-ass school of Akider, 'cause it rhymes with mesqueteer.")  Interesting extras, including a bewildered Elvis commenting on the film!  As the Beatles once said, "A good time is guaranteed for all."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Replaces 'Gone with the Wind' as America's greatest film"></head><body><p>In the hundred years or so of American Cinema, there have been epic moments; Gone with the Wind, Cleopatra, True Grit, Star Wars, Dr. Zivago, etc... Well now we can add a new film to the list of 'Greatest of the Great'......Freddy Vs. Jason!<p>The professionalism of acting, the firm hand of the director, the special effects wizards, and of course Ken and Robert can all be proud. They really came through. <p>I could go on forever how this was the greatest movie ever made (it is). But I will stick with just one subject before this review becomes 500 pages of praise. I will give praise to Ken who played the part of Jason Voorhees.<p>Never before has Jason played a part like this. He's almost the good guy, almost. To express such emotion while wearing a mask and never uttering a line is the ultimate challange to an actor. But with the turn of the head, the puppy dog eye, and the heroic stand against Freddy, Jason did well. Well beyond what we all thought he could.<p>Jason is more than a killing machine wearing a hockey mask. He is each and every one of us. Yes, Jason lives in us all, and we all wish we were him. Remember the abusive boyfriend in the beginning of the movie? Words can hurt. Jason knows this, he takes care of the boyfriend as best he can. He stabs him with a machette about 15 times then folds him in half backwards. Brilliant. <p>Or take the party out in the cornfield. Underage drinking, wanton lust, use of illegal drugs. What parent wouldn't want Jason to be a chaparone? He broke up that party quicker than you can say "That was one p*ssed off goalie". Jason is truly the champion of wholesome upbringing and virginity. Sin is the weed and Jason is the gardener.<p>And the final fight with Freddy? Sure Freddy can beat anyone in their dreams, but we can do anything in our dreams. Win our girl, have wealth and fame, be handsome or beautiful. But when we wake up, reality takes over and we drudge on with our lives. <p>Three times in the theater I saw this movie, and everytime it happened. When Freddy realizes he is in the real world, he turns around with fright on his face. Jason slowly rises and is ready to kick butt. The audience screamed, howled, and cheered. Cheering for Jason? My word, I never thought I'd see the day. <p>Yes friends, believe the hype. Never a Jason or Freddy fan you say? Watch this movie, you'll be on eBay in no time buying up every Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm street movie you can find.</p></body></html>

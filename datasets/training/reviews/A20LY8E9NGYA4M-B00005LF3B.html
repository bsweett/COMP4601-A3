<meta name="summary" content="A WELL MADE MOVIE."></head><body><p>&quot;Cast Away&quot; reunites once again the awarded team Zemeckis / Hanks, and once again they made a good film. There are several remarkable aspects in &quot;Cast Away&quot;: overall the cinematography is excellent, the photography is quite realistic and Tom Hank's characterization is also great.<br /><br /> Robert Zemeckis and William Broyles (screenwriter) showed a lot of creativity by including the lovable character &quot;Wilson&quot;, definitely a character to remember. &quot;Cast Away&quot; sometimes feels and looks so realistic that you really feel trapped in a lonely island with Tom Hanks. You will suffer along Chuck Noland (Hanks) loneliness and desperation.<br /><br /> Technically &quot;Cast Away&quot; is almost flawless, like all the movies directed by Robert Zemeckis, and overall the story is very good and realistic. However the movie also has weak spots: Helen Hunt is misused in a very lackluster role to Helen's standards. The first half hour of the movie elapses with few highlights, and the last half hour is kinda disappointing.<br /><br /> At the end of the day, &quot;Cast Away&quot; is a worthy movie. Specially for Tom Hanks' fans or Robert Zemeckis' fans.</p></body></html>

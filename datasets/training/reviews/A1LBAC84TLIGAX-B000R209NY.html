Your roles in movies like The Thing and 3000 Miles to Graceland were great, and now you're like a cheap prostitute for a movie role. You just had to pick a worthless role of a father of a teenage daughter with all the stupid drama thrown in... a disaster movie. Great....<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Think of this movie as a combination of Titanic and The Perfect Storm. Then, remove the great characters and replace them with characters so worthless you care less about them being killed than stupid teenagers who get killed in horror movies, and then add liberal politics into the mix. During a cruise on the Poseidon, a gigantic freak wave causes the ship to capsize (flip upside down), trapping several people on board with a limited air bubble while they wait for help to come. But, a group of people decide not to wait and try to escape; a gambler, the gambler's smuggled girlfriend, a homosexual old man (Uuuugggghhhh....), an annoying kid (Why couldn't you drown in the movie?) and his mom, the mayor of New York (Kurt Russel), his daughter, and her boyfriend.<br />MUSIC: The music is bland and rarely sets the mood. It can at key moments, but fails to the rest of the time.<br />ACTION: The best parts of the film are scenes with the ship being flipped over, people drowning, things being turned over and destroyed, explosions, and some extra action. The action is the best part, too bad the whole film couldn't be filled with a lot more of those moments.<br />ACTING: The script is full of predictable dialogue, and the actors don't do a very good job bringing the already sub-par script to life. Their acting capabilities are laughable at best.<br />ENTERTAINMENT: You will only want to watch this movie for the action scenes, not really anything else. If you wish to see all of it, I hope you have humor, because you will only get pissed off if you don't. Take advantage of the flaws and laugh at them, because they are laughable (Yay! We've escaped! Oh look, there just so happens to be a raft over there).<br />OVERALL: I would only recommend this as a rental for now, not a buy. I managed to take advantage of the flaws and laugh at them for how bad they were, but this film was overall very disappointing and had so much more potential. Plus, adding politics into the mix, kinda ruins the experience. Decent overall, but disappointing.<br />THE GOOD: The action moments.<br />THE BAD: The acting, the politics, predictable dialogue and events, unintentionally funny.</p></body></html>

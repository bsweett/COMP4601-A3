But after veiwing it I dont think i will see any future Rob Zombie films if there going to be this bad!<p>I was expecting to hear alot of Rob's music in the soundtrack, but was disapointed by only about 3 or 4 maybe 5 i heard during the film.<p>By now youve read other reviews of what this movie is about. And most people havent shared my opionion about this film, but i must say it was horrible. The acting is terrible and the plot may not be predicatable, but it still was stupid and when it came to about the 1 hour 20 minute mark of the film, it just did not want to end! It just kept taking all these new twist and turns and was getting quite boring and completly unbeleivable and I was begging for the movie to finally finsih. it sure went for way to long!<p>The most annoying thing in it would have to be the girls laugh. If you have heard the laugh sound on the &quot;Sinister Urge&quot; or &quot;Soundtrack to this movie&quot; song &quot;house of 1000 corpses&quot; then by the end of this film you will be so sick of hearing that laugh you will want to smack her in themouth and tell her to shut up! The movie isnt even really titles well, seeing as how the house does not contain 1000 corpses (not thats seen anyway) and comes later in an underground cave type of thing there for it was named pretty badly! In my opinion it should have been called &quot;movie of 1000 annoying bad laughs and screams&quot; cheesy plots and jokes, and nothing speichel about this film to make it any diffrent from any other lame horror flick. Wanna see a great horror movie? then dont bother with this one, only Rob Zombie's die hard fans will love this flick!<p>It apparently took 2 years to finally get a release. but dont expect that to be because of some kind of scene that the FDA or whoever they are didnt want you to see... its probably because they didnt want to release such a bad movie with such a bad plot, and bad acting....and that annoying girls laugh :S there not one thing scary about this film!</p></body></html>

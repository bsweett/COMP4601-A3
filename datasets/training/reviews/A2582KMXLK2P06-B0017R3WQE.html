I loved this movie.<br /><br />It really delivers with the action and the characters are all interesting, especially Tony Montana. A movie that deserves to be as lengthy as it is (over 2 hours). Everyone must see Scarface at least once in their lifetime. It won't disappoint. The ending gave me goosebumps it was *that* good and intense. Watch it now.</p></body></html>

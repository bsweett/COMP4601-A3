<meta name="summary" content="Gruesome - but an Intriguing Idea"></head><body><p>The movie starts off very quickly, and you get a sense of urgency that things need to be done quickly for the cast of characters to be on the move.  Starting in NYC, and then in Philadelphia, you are taken on a bizzare ride and race for survival.  Mark Walberg does a superb job, as does Zooey Deschanel. It was nice to see John Lequizamo in a serious role.  He shows his ability to convince you he is a hiding his fear behind his strength, as he goes on a rescue mission for his wife.<br /><br />More gorey than any previous Shyamalan flick, this is really a bit off of what I expected.  His movies always have a bit of a surprise in them as well, where here, we follow the plot to its conclusion.  The scenes of self mutilation were thankfully few and mostly off screen, however, I think there is quite enough of that in society without any kind of epidemic.<br /><br />With the end, there is a sweet little old lady they run into who seems to have some very bizarre behavior issues.  It seemed that there were two issues at hand in the end, giving me a mixed idea of what the point was.<br /><br />Anyway, the premise itself, the enviroment turning on the only ones who really impact it, quite an idea.</p></body></html>

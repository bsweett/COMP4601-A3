<meta name="summary" content="brilliant, but hard to watch..."></head><body><p>...aesthetically, this film was simply brilliant.  <p>However, it was hard to watch Charlize Theron's character careen downhill for most of the last 2/3rds of the movie.  The parts where she tries to go straight and does job interviews are especially painful---I kept looking away from the TV screen because it was so painful to watch---really a testament to her phenomenal acting skills.  <p>There is a raw emotional/spiritual violence going on here and perfectly captured on screen that is far far worse than anything I saw in "Saving Private Ryan" or "Schindler's List"---it is the absolute horror and heartbreak of watching the total and relentless destruction of a human being despite all of her indomitable vitality and will.  This is what I imagine it'd be like to watch somebody being buried alive, you end up wishing for a mercy killing, that someone would at least be kind of enough to shoot her first.<p>It's safe to say that Charlize Theron earned her Oscar every bit of the way.  <p>Christina Ricci also puts in a very strong performance as Lee's lesbian girlfriend...I don't know what their real-life sexual orientation is, but the scenes where the two women first make out outside of a roller rink are as dizzyingly passionate as any I've ever seen on film.</p></body></html>

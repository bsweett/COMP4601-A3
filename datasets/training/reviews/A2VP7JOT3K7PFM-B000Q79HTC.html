<meta name="summary" content="Bourne to Survive"></head><body><p>XXXXX<br /><br />This movie is loosely based on the 1980 novel of the same name by Robert Ludlum (1927 to 2001).<br /><br />Do you like action-packed mystery-thrillers?  If you do, then this movie is a must-see.<br /><br />The viewer along with the main character in this movie, later revealed to be Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), suffers from amnesia, not knowing his own identity (thus the movie's title) or anything about his past.  As the movie progresses, both the viewer and Bourne discover one major thing: he posses a lethal survival skill-set that's light years above that of the average Joe.  The other things Bourne discovers about himself make him unhappy with him, at one point saying:<br /><br />"Everything I find out [about myself], I want to forget."<br /><br />Once the viewer discovers that the premise of this entire movie is about discovering identity, then it can only hold the viewer's attention in one way: through action.  It is on this that the movie delivers especially with respect to incredible fight sequences.  One character summarizes the majority of the movie when he says that Bourne leaves a<br /><br />"trail of collateral damage from Zurich to Paris."<br /><br />It is at the movie's end that all is revealed.<br /><br />Matt Damon as Jason Bourne effectively carries the entire movie.  If not for his fine performance, I think this movie would have probably been a flop.  I also found that the background music and sometimes gritty photography to be impressive.<br /><br />This movie spawned two sequels: "The Bourne Supremacy" (2004) and "The Bourne Ultimatum" (2007).<br /><br />The only problem with this movie is that the idea of Bourne constantly trying to discover his identity can become tedious.  True, the action sequences attempt to take away from this tedium but I found myself getting a bit restless as the movie proceeded.<br /><br />Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2004) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  There are many extras including an alternate ending.<br /><br />In conclusion, this movie introduces us to a new action hero and his name is Jason Bourne!!<br /><br />(2002;  1 hr 50 min (excluding end credits);  wide screen;  20 scenes)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXX</p></body></html>

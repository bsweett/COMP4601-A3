<meta name="summary" content="Sin"></head><body><p>Author Frank Miller and director Robert Rodriguez bring to the big screen one of the most explicit, violent and character-driven graphic novels of recent years.  Based on solid performances by a bunch of hot-shot actors (Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Brittany Murphy, Rosario Dawson, Benicio del Toro, Jessica Alba, Rutger Hauer, among others), and with author Frank Miller giving the proper assistance to Rodriguez, "Sin City" is a masterpiece of noir atmosphere, since the very first scene to the apocalyptic and self-destructing ending.<br /><br />Violence fills every scene. The monochromatic, grayish shots are almost claustrophobic, and the violence depicted is so effective that you expect a splat of blood or a loose bullet to strike you in the audience.<br /><br />There are three "Sin City" stories in this movie, that somewhat come togheter at the end. The first one is about Jim Hartigan (Bruce Willis) an aging, close-to-retirement cop that investigates a series of rape-murder-kills, only to discover that the murderer is a very influent person. The second story features an almost irrecognizeable Mickey Rourke - the best actor in the movie -, a sort of unstoppable super-hero-like character, trying to avenge the murder of the only woman that gave herself up to him without charging anything. And the third story is about how Dwight and Johnny-Boy have a curious meeting that may break up the ballance between the hookers, the Mob and the Police in Basin City dark alleys.<br /><br />The direction, the final computer art and the casting is so good that I almost expected to see the text baloons coming out of the character's mouths in the screen. Great effort, great result.<br /><br />Grade 9.0/10</p></body></html>

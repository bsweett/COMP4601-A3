<meta name="summary" content="The Second Time Around Still Isn't Out Of This World"></head><body><p>I should have learned my lesson the first time around. After the dismal first pairing of these two modern-day Horror/Sci-Fi icons failed to deliver, I should have realized that an unexpected sequel would do any better. However, this second time around does do better than it's first, but not enough to stop wishing for either an Alien 5 or Predator 3.<br /><br />Like a page from Casting 101, you have the typical parade of careless characters:The bad boy with brother, the sympathic cop, the solider coming home, and various family members searching for the rest of their clan. There's no time, or need, to care about them, but you figure you'd care about what's going to get them, being the A's and the P's. But honestly after a total of seven movies showing what these monsters do, you can't really be surprised like the first couple of times. Now granted, the Unrated version, of which I'm reviewing here, has a ton of graphic scenes, just how many times can a chest-burster or acid blood be impressive? And for a gore-hound like me to be actually bored with this should tell you something. And if that wasn't the worst of it, the Alien/Predator attacks happen mostly at night, and it looks like in the complete dark as well. 80% of all the scenes are so dark, it's hard to tell what you're looking at. And finally, it's ending is supposed to be some sort of prequel to either the original Alien or Predator films (according to the directors' commentary), but honestly I couldn't place how that could be.<br /><br />In my opinion, only to be viewed by die-hard fans of either franchise, or the seven people who found the first film entertaining. Oh, I almost forgot: remember the underwhelming "more human than Alien" Alien at the end of Alien:Resurrection? Well, if you can turn your brightness control high enough on your set, you'll see this film's equivalent, the PredAlien!!!<br /><br />Yeah, it's as bad as it sounds.<br />(RedSabbath Rating:5.5/10)</p></body></html>

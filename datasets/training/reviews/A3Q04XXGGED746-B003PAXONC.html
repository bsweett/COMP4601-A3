<meta name="summary" content="What If You Are the Only Person Left on Earth?"></head><body><p>Imagine going everywhere you used to go to, and never encounter another living human. Robert Neville does. He ends up talking to statues, and listening to pre-recorded news clips to remember what humans sound like. He broadcasts from a radio to see if there are any other humans who survived the killer virus. For a time, his only companion is his dog.<br /><br />All this time, Neville has dreams at night that remind him how an out-of-control virus ended wiping out nearly the entire human race, and turning the remainder of them into nonhuman-like predators. He locks himself up in his home in New York City every night, fearing these predators.<br /><br />Virologist Neville knows that he is immune from the virus, and is trying to make a vaccine that could change these predators back into humans. Will he succeed? Will he meet any other humans? Or is he alone forever?<br /><br />I have not read the book on which this movie is partly based. As a movie, it is chilling and suspenseful.</p></body></html>

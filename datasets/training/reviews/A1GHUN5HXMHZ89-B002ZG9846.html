<meta name="summary" content="Kick-Ass"></head><body><p>When I saw the trailers when this movie was at the theaters I thought this might be an entertaining young adult movie and so I added it to my to rent list. Had I known how entertaining I would have made a now rare visit to my local theater to enjoy this with an audience when it first released. Most kids and even some adults still have the dream of making a difference whether doning a costume or just helping their community in some way. The story here is compelling and like the music starts at a slow tempo as we are introduced first to "Kick-Ass", well portrayed by Aaron Johnson. He is a high school student that finally gets tired of bullies and decides to take steps to not only improve his own self-esteem but assist others that are afraid to take a stand. On his first mission to save a lost cat he drops literally into three men beating up another. His fight to defend the single man from the gang is painful for him and lands him it the hospital with broken bones but it is posted on all the usual hot amateur video sites and he becomes famous overnight.<br /><br />This stardom catches the attention of "Hit Girl", remarkably done by Chloe Moretz (some superbly choreagraphed scenes make her larger than life), and "Big Daddy", well played by Nicolas Cage (purposely overacted while in hero mode is good acting not bad), that have been more reclusive and deadlier against criminals. When they save Kick-Ass from certain death a bond is formed against crime. The choreography and stunts of the fight scenes are phenomenal and the music is fantastic (the CD will be a huge hit I'm sure). As the story unfolds we find out that Big Daddy not only was falsely accused of drug trafficing while he was a police officer but he ends up in jail and his wife commits suicide. Fortunately their daughter is born with her death. When Big Daddy gets out of prison he vows to avenge his wife, and he enlists the aid of his very young daughter on his quest. Enter the villains son, Red Mist, that convinces his father to get him some gear to impress Kick-Ass so that he can lure him into a trap. The events that transpire after this build to an incredible climax that is suspenseful and exhilarating.<br /><br />I won't spoil things for you with any more of the details but there are some absolutely hysterical/bloody scenes that will quite possibly have you laughing and crying with joy. Anyone that feels overly offended by vigilantes may be disturbed. Although I'm not saying I condone it, how can I possibly condone what criminals do to the innocent public? Keep in mind everyone has been exposed to far worse on the news every day. I highly recommend this to anyone that can appreciate unconventional heroes and can stomach some bloody killing scenes. The DVD has excellent quality picture and sound with a few extras. Superb story, casting, directing, choreography, stunts, camera work, costumes, music, and special effects.

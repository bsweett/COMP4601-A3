<meta name="summary" content="Original Screenplay + Some suspenseful moments and twists + It makes people feel happy and hopeful"></head><body><p>The script is absolutely original to me. My family members and I were puzzled for the first 15 minutes of the screen. We were glued to the screen in order to find out why a non-educated orphan could answer correctly all the questions in Who Wants to Be a Millionaire show.<br /><br />The scenes of the answers to the last 2 questions are full of twists and suspense. One example is the moment when Jamal phoned his brother for the answer of the last question.<br /><br />The movie graphically and convincingly shows how determined Jamal was in order to get what he wanted. For example, he jumped into a pile of human waste that was higher than he in order to see his movie star in person.<br /><br />The scene where the bad guys scooped out the eye of the street kid had some truth in it. Some of my friends from a third world country said something like that did happen in their homeland. There were some gangs that kidnapped children. Then they twisted their arms to make them disabled. Then they forced those kids to beg for money from spectators.<br /><br />Besides all the reasons above, this movie makes people happy and hopeful with its happy ending. I believe that's one of the reasons why many people love it. No wonder it won 6 Oscar prizes in 2009. They included best picture, best adapted screenplay, best directing, best editing, best sound mixing, and best original score (According to Oscars dot org site.)<br /><br />Freida Pinto is not convincing in her role as Latika, the love of Jamal but no movie is perfect. This film deserves 5 stars.</p></body></html>

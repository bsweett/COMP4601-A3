<meta name="summary" content="a very cool superhero movie"></head><body><p>Iron Man is a very awesome movie to watch. he built 2 other variations of suits before he built the red and gold one. my impression is that it was a 2000's imitation of Robocop. Hugo Weaving, who was the voice of Megatron, supplied the voice for the bad robot. I heard plenty of rock in this movie, but I didn't hear any cussing. if I had kids, I would be comfortable in letting them watch this movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Citizen Kane"></head><body><p>I'm a 16 year old self proclaimed film buff, and I can't see how people can call this film boring and overrated. True, it was made in 1941, and it's in black and white, but it's a masterpiece nevertheless. This film is noteworthy for several reasons. This work is consistently at the top of film lists. It has a special place in film history for the innovative approach employed at the time it was released in 1941. From my perspective, this film should be on the summer viewing lists for every high school student. The Rosebud symbol is still recognized even though more than a half century has passed.</p></body></html>

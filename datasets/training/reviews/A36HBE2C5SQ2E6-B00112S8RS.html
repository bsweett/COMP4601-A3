<meta name="summary" content="Old age is sure not slowing Lumet down."></head><body><p>Two Brothers (Hoffman and Hawke) Andy and Hank, desperate for some cash, decide to rob their parent's jewelry store. They decide to split the money that is in the safe. The day of the robbery, Hank uses a accomplice instead, that has disastrous results and ends up making their father (Finney) seek vengeance on the people that had done him wrong. What you reap, you sow.<br /><br />I have been a fan of Lumet since I saw Dog Day Afternoon, and heard Al Pacino utter "Attica", I was impressed with the way the film had been with the opening song, then silence afterwards. It showed the director had a talent that I liked. The director had this air of originality around him as the film went on. Directors, when they age, tend to lose their magic of their earlier films, and end up making not as good films. Lumet has a brilliant porfoilio of works that range from 12 Angry Men to Serpico to Network. This can be added as it is a work that is alike but different in so many ways. He takes the film places that have not been gone before. It is a biting movie that plays out as a Greek tragedy that takes place in modern day society. The film is vicious.<br /><br />The performances in this film were outstanding. Personally, I am not that big a fan of Ethan Hawke, as he is a decent actor, but his performance in the film was heavy. He uses desperate and pathetic as his adjectives to push his performance forward towards great. The performance, though, was outdone by Philip Semyour Hoffman, as yet again, he adds to his long list of characters that are weak willed, and He steals the show by making his character so outlandishly distant from reality.<br /><br />I also liked the film transfer as it gave it a clean, sharp look. It is indeed the wave of the future. Also, the only real problems I had was with Marisa Tomei's peformance. Also, why did her breasts appear every 2 minutes? they deserved their own credit for appearing so much, and I disliked the weird scene transitions, as they came out of nowhere some points. But, after those minor flaws this film is really one that could be overlooked, and it needs to be seen by upcoming directors as it shows how exactly to direct a really masterful crime thriller with some of the best actors.<br /><br />See it before it's too late.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Lively thriller."></head><body><p>This is a lively thriller that goes deeper than it appeared from the trailer or previews.  An attorney with a conscience is killed when he tries to help a young girl being hurt by a huge corporate cover up.  His friend, Michael Clayton, is the next on the hit list and pursued once he begins to peel away the layers of his friend's mysterious death. When Clayton accidentally uncovers a pile of lies, the only way to save himself seems to be 'playing dead' while he sniffs out the people behind the arranged 'accidents'.<br /><br />Chrissy K.

It's funny, fast-paced and interesting.  And  it's almost embarrassing to identify with the smooth talking and risk taking arms dealer whose business results in death and destruction.  Jared Leto is cast as Cage's younger brother and the two of them make a good team.  There's love interest, of course, played by Bridget Moynahan, the wife that Cage tries to keep in the dark about his real profession.<br /><br />The settings are Brooklyn, the Ukraine and parts of Africa and Nicholas Cage is at home in these places.  He's witty, self-confident and likable.  And the audience cannot help but feel some empathy with him.<br /><br />There's something about this film that reeks of bad taste.  But so what?  It's enjoyable, and it pokes fun at a profession that we all know exists.  I enjoyed it and recommend it although it's not for the squeamish.</p></body></html>

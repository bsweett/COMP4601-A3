<meta name="summary" content="My new animated movie obsession"></head><body><p>I fell madly in love with this movie the first time my sister-in-law insisted I see it.  As a person who has read Cressida Cowell's series, I will be the first to admit this has not a single thing to do with its source book, but wow, this is an animated movie of heart among animated movies.  It's wonderfully simple while still boasting plenty of emotion. It's funny.  It's snappy.  The animation and music are gorgeous.  And hey, who doesn't love dragons?<br /><br />The story is of a Viking boy named Hiccup who is the worst Viking of his tribe. He's shrimpy, too smart-alecky for his own good, and he happens to be the over-protected son of the chief.  The tribe has been waging a centuries-old war with the dragons who prey on the same food suppy, so Hiccup believes that if he kills a dragon he will finally earn some respect.  So he invents a machine to shoot down a dragon, accomplishes the conceptual goal, and sets about killing it.  Only he is unable to.  Instead, he winds up making a pet out of the dragon he names Toothless.<br /><br />This movie is, by all definitions, adorable.  The kids will love the cute dragons, the teen set will love the hint of teen romance and all the action, and as an adult I was intrigued by both the relationships in the movie as well as the pure movie-making art.  Truly, there is something for everyone.<br /><br />The blu-ray/dvd is standard and suitable blu-ray/dvd entertainment, though it seemed most of the good stuff was added to the blu-ray, leaving the dvd itself with very little.  Still, we get the commentary (I love commentary), a pop-up fact track (lots of fun), deleted scenes (always interesting) as well as a fun little Viking personality quiz.  Not to mention the short movie, which I found quite enjoyable.  Nothing terribly special, but certainly worthy.<br /><br />Still, the reason to buy anything is the movie itself.  It's enchanting.</p></body></html>

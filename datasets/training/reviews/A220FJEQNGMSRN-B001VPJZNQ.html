<meta name="summary" content="An enjoyable disposable action flick"></head><body><p>The  Rundown (aka Welcome to the Jungle) is more fun than it looks without ever making it to the top grade of disposable action schlock. Aside from one energetic fight with diminutive rebels swinging from ropes, director Peter Berg isn't so hot at action scenes, the script doesn't bother with much in the way of explanations and a little of Ewan Bremner's Pogues act goes a long, long way. But The Rock is a likeable lead, Seann William Scott is less annoying than usual, Christopher Walken works his usual value for money mojo as the villain of the piece (typecasting, you say?) and Rosario Dawson is hot, so all shortcomings are forgivable. As one action hero says to the other in a nice cameo, "Heff fun." Fairly good DVD extras too.</p></body></html>

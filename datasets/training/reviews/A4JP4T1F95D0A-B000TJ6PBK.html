Yes it is about a haunted hotel room, but there were not that many shocking moments.  This is more of a character story about a man trying to deal with the death of his daughter and his non belief in god or anything beyond the living.  I think the story fails to be a balls out scarefest and it also fails to bring a full and satisfactory conclusion to his issues.  Cusack does a fine jobe and a brief appearance by Jackson is also good.  The ending was a little weak and the alternate endings presented in the extras are really no better.  This was a good rental and I am sure some people will love it, but for me it will remain a rental.</p></body></html>

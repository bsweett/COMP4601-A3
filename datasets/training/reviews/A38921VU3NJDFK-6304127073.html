<meta name="summary" content="Total Recall (1990)"></head><body><p>Paul Verhoeven's Arnie-boasting sci-fi saga is a whirlwind of violence and pace that investigates the connection between actuality and fantasy, and does so with swagger. Based on a story by Philip K. Dick, this film, which also stars Sharon Stone as Schwarzenegger's wife, was a great financial success (despite its then-huge $65 million budget) and added to the appeal of both of its star actors. As one of the more memorable articles of Contemporary Era science-fiction cinema, Total Recall is a worthy addition to your DVD (or even Blu-ray) collection.</p></body></html>

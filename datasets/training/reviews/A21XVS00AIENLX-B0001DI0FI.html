<meta name="summary" content="A realistic Tale of Naval Adventure"></head><body><p>Director Peter Weir delved deeply into the relationship between Captain Jack Aubrey and his crew as they embark on a cat and mouse game to capture or destroy the highly advanced French enemy frigate, Acheron. Russell Crowe's portrayal of Capt Jack Aubrey was finely tuned to create a brilliant tactician with wit, humor and intense leadership qualities with much humanity.  He was able to laugh with his men yet instill the highest standards of discipline and expected protocol to be followed to the tee.  The ship's doctor, a naturist and healer, does not understand the military mindset and understands even less the fine line between friendship and duty.  It's through their banter we come to understand the leadership-style and character of Capt Jack Aubrey.<p>The great plus of this movie resides in the extensive detail that is put into recreating a late 17th century era from both a Naval and Darwinian viewpoint.  Orders, protocol, uniforms, salutes, meals, canons and even choice language is very well depicted in this movie.  The actors make it seem as if their whole lives had been on that ship.  You really felt like you were part of that crew. Equally realistic is the doctor's fascination with the creatures of the Galapagos Islands, calling the animals by their scientific name and keeping a detailed diary of drawings.  <p>The director definitely wanted to highlight the emerging presence of modern science and how it could be challenging to centuries of tradition and values.  This is clearly paralleled in the doctor's and Capt Aubrey's distinct philosophies. But Weir is clever enough to resolve this by showing the two can co-exist and prove quite a powerful, if not necessary, combination.  <p>If you're expecting a movie with a lot of barking orders, swashbuckling and canon-fire in scene after scene, just all out action, then you could be mistaking this for Pirates of the Carribean or even Gladiator. This is very much a serious drama with engaging action sequences built into it, not the other way around. So it can be slightly off-putting, if not a bit boring.  <p>Nonetheless a worthwhile and insightful film.  I highly recommended.</p></body></html>

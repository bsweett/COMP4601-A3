<meta name="summary" content="Awesome Movie - Terrible BluRay"></head><body><p>Being a die hard Predator (not Predator II of course) fan, I considered myself lucky to find the Blu Ray version on sale at target for $15.00, and I bought it to replace my SD version.  It is OMG terrible, could even be worse quality than the SD disc.  If you're considering upgrading to Blu Ray - DON'T!!!</p></body></html>

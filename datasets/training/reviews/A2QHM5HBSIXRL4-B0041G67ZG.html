<meta name="summary" content="Pollack's directing and editing make 'The Interpreter' worth seeing"></head><body><p>I think in many directors' hands, "The Interpreter" would be run-of-the-mill stuff.  Thankfully, Sydney Pollack isn't run-of-the-mill quality.  He's crafted a really suspenseful and - in my mind - realistic thriller that keeps you fully engaged throughout the entire film.  [And, I might add, Pollack - as usual - acts here as well and he's as engaging on camera as he is talented behind it.]<br /><br />Now, I've never been a big Nicole Kidman fan ("To Die For" aside), and the coquettish whisper in which she delivers every line in this film is certainly distracting. Thankfully, Pollack gets solid performances from Catherine Keener, Sean Pean, George Harris (on a roll after "Layer Cake") and the Danish actor Jesper Christensen.  Christensen, in particular, makes the film in my estimation.  Is he a good guy or a bad guy, you're never quite sure.  [In fact, in the 'Deleted Scenes' on the DVD, you can see Pollack stripped out a couple of scenes that give away some of Christensen's character and motivations too early.  That's a master touch because the end product keeps you guessing without losing any of the narrative drive.]<br /><br />At the heart of tale woven by Pollack is the story of African dictator 'Zuwanie,' as portrayed by the regal (and then-88-year-old!!) Earl Cameron, a dictator in the Mobutu mold (colonial liberator slowly morphing to repressive, gun-toting dictator).  Will he be killed on an upcoming trip to the UN (as Kidman's character has overheard) or will a staged and failed assassination attempt consolidate and strengthen his hand back home (as Harris' 'Kuman-Kuman' suggests)?  Again, Pollack's editing is what keeps the balls in the air on this question and it'll keep you hooked until the end.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The cutting edge of creative filmmaking.  I loved it!"></head><body><p>What would you do if someone gave you a card that told you that they had had all memory of you erased?<p> <p>Interesting concept.  But can it work in a film?<p> <p>Well, Charlie Kaufman, who wrote Being John Malkovich wrote the screenplay and he's somewhat of a creative genius.  And Focus Features, the specialty unit of Universal Pictures that brought us Lost in Translation, Swimming Pool, The Pianist and Far From Heaven is producing it.  Then take Jim Carrey who is ready for a serious role and Kate Winslet who has won her share of acting accolades, add an excellent supporting cast and put some big bucks into creative editing and cinematography and the result is clearly one of the most imaginative films I have ever seen.  <p> <p>As I watched the film, I was totally confused.  Where was the beginning, middle and end?  There's a romance going one between Winslet and Carrey.  But how much is happening in the present, how much has happened in the past, and how much is a distorted memory?  At first I was annoyed.  I like linear stories.  I like to know where I am in time and space.  But there's no comfort of this sort in the film.  <p> <p>And yet, I loved the characters.  Even the supporting characters who were cast as employees of a company that specialized in erasing memories.  Mark Ruffalo, who I have come to appreciate for the range of his acting ability, is cast as a geek technician. Kisten Durst is cast as the receptionist and Tom Wilkinson is cast as the doctor who is willing to admit that memory erasure procedure is, in reality, brain damage.<p> <p>Some might view this as a comedy, and, indeed there are several funny moments.  But even though the film might be whimsical at times, it has a serious theme.  And the way it is put together, it is almost impossible to understand what is happening until after the film.  While it is going on there just isn't time for reflection.  Instead, as a subtext I found myself reliving some of my own memories.  They flashed though my mind in concert with what was happening on the screen.  <p> <p>Some of the scenes in the film annoyed me, others were crafted with great subtlety and sensitivity.  If I, myself, were editing it, I would have eliminated the Alice In Wonderland-style shrinking into childhood scenes.  But yet, I'm aware that they added another layer of perspective.<p> <p>The ending made the film worthwhile because it resolved what at first seemed disjointed.  And I know that this is one of those films I'd enjoy even more if I saw it again and again and again.<p> <p>Highly recommended for film buffs and anyone willing to step out of the box of perceived ideas of what film should be and experience the cutting edge of creative filmmaking.</p></body></html>

This time around, it isn't a giant lizard or aliens, though.  This time, it's Big Momma Nature.  I caught this one in the cinema, and I'm sure that it has a better payoff there than on the TV.  It's still worth a look though.<br /><br />The premise of the story is a little wild, but all in all this is just another disaster flick.  There's no moral to this story(unless you're a tree-hugger who took this film to be a warning on mankind's affect on the environment).  Nope, nothing here but lots of things freezing up, Americans crossing over into Mexico, twisters in La-La land, and a really quick trip from Philly to NYC.  But everything looks pretty cool while all of this is happening.<br /><br />The film, if taken as nothing more than a reason to show off some neat special effects, is pretty good.  It does drag along somewhat, but let's face it, freezing things isn't as cool as watching them blow up.  The tornado scenes were some of the best bits of this flick, though they make a rather quick exit.  I also enjoyed the scenes involving the wolfpack(though they looked pretty fake).  The acting is standard and there's nothing really "great" about this picture.  But, as stated before, this flick is all about spectacle and light on story.  Nothing wrong with that, right?<br /><br />On the other hand, if you do consider this an environmental warning, WAKE UP!  This is nothing more than popcorn fun, and it suffices.<br /><br />There are better end o' the world movies out there, but this one won't let you down.  It's okay, but you might want to rent it on DVD before you lay down hard cash for it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Denzel. Not so great movie."></head><body><p>Let me ask a question. The character 'Joe Miller' in "Philadelphia," the character 'Matt Lee Whitlock' in "Out of Time," and the character 'John Creasy' in "Man on Fire"  . . . what's their racial background?<p>See, it's tricky to ask that question and it may appear insensitive and boorish. People look at you as though you just got caught opening a can of beer in the parking lot of a chrome shop and your name is Cooter or Bubba. <p>But I submit to you that Denzel Washington, like myself a Fordham University man (regrettably the comparison ceases there) is so good at what he does that three lines into the script or 40 seconds after the movie begins you forget that he is an African American actor. You are mesmerized (again) by viewing the craft of one of the best actors of our time. <p>Like other African American men and women, Ashe, Jeter, Winfrey, Powell, the skill at which they do and did their jobs becomes the only point of focus. And that's the way it should be. And if an actor can show it to us and speed the process, more power to him. <p>The plot of "Man on Fire" is oft used and simple. Burned out service man, cowboy, boxer, assassin, Knight of the Round Table, Priest, is rescued by a little guy, girl, pet, his girlfriend's sister, and wants to return to a "normal" life. Well not necessarily normal but at least not self destructive with occasional suicidal thoughts.<p>For John Creasy was the CIA and alcohol that started it all. Now his friend Christopher Walken is getting him perhaps the last job he can ever hope to hold, bodyguarding a 10 year old blond girl of wealthy parents. When their relationship develops he finds himself with little experience becoming a sort of surrogfate father, and his 'raison d'etre' is returned to him by the precocious Dakota Fanning. <p>His job is to protect her; when he fails at that she is kidnapped and he begins a journey of retribution, punishing those that took from him the person who gave him the gift of wanting to live again.<p>In that regard it's not an unordinary film. It's heavy handed in the violence department, and while that doesn't detract from Washington's consummate skills, it does point the movie towards "pulpdom." But Denzel Washington brings to the character of John Creasy a depth heretofore unseen in "tortured, wounded, dark heroes." While it's an (only slightly) above average film, Washington is worth the trip. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury</p></body></html>

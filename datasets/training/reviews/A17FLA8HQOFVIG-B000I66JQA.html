But yet, in some way, all are linked to the Virginia Woolf novel, "Mrs. Dalloway".  Each woman wakes up one morning with the anticipation of some sort of party.  There's Virginia Woolf herself in 1923, whose creativity as well as mental illness is apparent.  She's frustrated at her forced seclusion from the London she loves and is making time for her sister's visit.  There's Clarissa Vaughn, a middle-aged New York woman who is having a party for a good friend and former lover who is dying of AIDS.  And there's Julianne Moore as Laura Brown, a 1951 housewife who is planning on baking a cake for her husband's birthday.  Michael Cunningham linked all this together in the small masterpiece of a novel.  And the screenwriter, David Hare did nothing less than a brilliant job in adapting it to the screen.  I just finished reading the book and so I was particularly sensitive to the small changes, such as eliminating some of the minor characters.  But the rather introspective and sad tone of the book is still there.  And the characters spring to life in the kind of performances that will surely garner them all academy award nominations.<p>Nicole Kidman is cast as Virginia Woolf.  I was surprised at that because I think of her as a glamour queen.  However, for this role she wears a prosthetic nose, and her makeup gives her a sallow appearance.  She comes across as dowdy and homely and slightly insane.  And her acting is so good that I thought I was seeing the actual Virginia Woolf on the screen.  Meryl Streep is Clarissa Vaughn.  She's living with her own set of life regrets.  There's sadness beneath her veneer of the perfect hostess planning a party, and it's not a surprise when she lets it come out.  And then there is Julianne Moore cast as Laura Brown, all alone in her despondency even though she seems to have a perfect life.  Ed Harris is cast as the AIDS patient who is also going mad.  They, and the rest of the cast are some of the best actors in the business, and it really shows. <p>The cinematography and sets are also outstanding and the shifts between the three stories are seamless.  There will be a gesture in one scene that is picked up in the next and this kind of overlapping editing keeps the story flowing.  There's a theme of suicide throughout.  And bisexuality.  Mostly, though its about the our need for love and the choices we make about how to spend our hours.  Much of the story is painful.  But yet, its theme is universal. Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

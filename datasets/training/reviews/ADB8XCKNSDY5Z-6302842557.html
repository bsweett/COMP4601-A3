From sets, to costumes, to characters, to the story, to the perfomances, everything about this film is high, high quality.<br /><br />I really like how the narration is done from the antagonist's point of view, and speaking of the antagonist, I've never seen anyone do a better acting job.  It was as if you could see exactly what he was thinking the whole time.  Let's see Paris Hilton do that.<br /><br />The focus of this film isn't really on Mozart.  It's on a contemporary of his that no one knows about.  It's really a great story.  A must-see.</p></body></html>

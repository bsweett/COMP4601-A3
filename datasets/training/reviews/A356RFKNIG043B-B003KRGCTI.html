From the overblown filter effects to the oh-so-epic shots of Denzel silhouetted against the sky, it's all overdone. The only real saving grace here is Oldman, enjoyably quirky as usual. But Kunis is ridiculous, barely an actress but real good at waltzing around post-apocalypse with her perfectly coiffed LA salon hairdo flowing in the breeze. Give me a break.<br /><br />Washington is solid as ever, no complaints there, but he really just doesn't have much to work with here in terms of script. The occasional sword and gunfight, a few long walks down the scorched road, a cannibal here and there, it's all good. Or not. And I hate movies that feature rape scenes or even threats of them, just to justify yet another revenge killing. So easy and so manipulative, and such lazy film making. The biblical overtones are barely explored, and poorly when they are. It's all a bunch of gobbledygook in the end and only Oldman made it worth watching for me after about 45 minutes.<br /><br />And what's up with the dynamic range on blu-rays and dvds lately? You can barely hear the dialogue and then suddenly BOOM BOOM BOOM!!! Huge gunshots or whatever crush your eardrums and you're grasping for the remote to save your brain when suddenly you can barely hear everyone talking again. I don't want to ride shotgun on the remote the whole movie. Use a limiter and do us a favor, or at least have a track with optional compression, because we're hearing too many guns and not enough words lately.<br /><br />All in all, not bad, but hardly fabulous, and when compared to its much worthier apocalyptic brethren, especially The Road Warrior (which has a perfect blu-ray transfer and looks better than this over-filtered sepia mess despite being made three decades earlier), Eli is merely a footnote.</p></body></html>

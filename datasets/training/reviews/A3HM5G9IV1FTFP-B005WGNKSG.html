After seeing it, I get it ... this is an engrossing, smart, suspenseful film. As a thriller and mystery, it works better than at least 90% of the thrillers/mysteries Hollywood puts out, so I can see why even Americans would be drawn to the film.<br /><br />The film first introduces its two main characters, Mikael and Lisbeth, separately, and then gradually ties their stories together. Mikael is a middle-aged journalist about to be wrongfully convicted of libel (which is apparently a crime in Sweden punishable by prison time) who is asked by an aging aristocrat to investigate the 40-year old disappearance/murder of his favorite niece. Lisbeth is a troubled, 24 year old professional hacker with a dark and tragic past and an even darker present. She becomes acquainted with Mikael while first being hired to hack into his files, and then, after gaining an interest herself in solving the 40-year-old murder, is recruited by him to assist in the investigation.<br /><br />Lisbeth is a knockout character (played wonderfully by an actress, Noomi Rapace, who I've never heard of before but will never forget). She's a paradox and an enigma. She's clearly damaged after a lifetime of horrific abuse, but refuses to be a victim, doling out vengeance and violence mercilessly when appropriate. Yet she also clearly has maintained her own sense of morality and humanity. Noomi Rapace gives a subtly magnetic and charismatic performance, and you can't take your eyes off her when she's on the screen.<br /><br />Although the film belongs to Lisbeth, her character has a nice chemistry with Mikael. As the two work together to dig through decades of one family's dark secrets in order to solve the mystery, the two develop a subtle, tentative bond. Lisbeth is guarded to say the least, but it's clear that she sees Mikael as one of the very few people in life she might actually be able to trust. When Lisbeth initiates sex with Mikael, it seems odd, for many reasons, but it makes sense in a weird way ... maybe it's Lisbeth's only way of showing affection, or maybe Lisbeth just wants to know what it's like to have sex with a man who isn't going to horribly abuse her.<br /><br />By the end of the film, the central mystery has been solved, and some more of Lisbeth's tragic past has been revealed. And as a viewer, I was left immediately wanting more ... which is why the sequel went immediately to the top of my "must watch" list.</p></body></html>

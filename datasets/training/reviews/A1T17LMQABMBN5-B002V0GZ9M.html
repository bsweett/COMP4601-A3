<meta name="summary" content="Bullock and Reeves make magic..."></head><body><p>It was so nice to watch a film starring Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves that doesn't have a speeding bus as part of the plot.  These two actors have great chemistry, which was shown in the movie Speed, and it was nice seeing them in a romantic film.  This is the story of Kate and Alex, two people who are perfect for each other.  There's one significant problem though -- they're in a long distance relationship.  Alex is in the year 2004 and Kate is in the year 2006.  They meet by way of the lake house, where Kate moves out of to work as a doctor in Chicago.  Alex owns the lake house, and his letter exchange with Kate begins after the former tenant (Kate) leaves a welcome letter to the new tenant (Alex)... except that Alex lives two years behind Kate.  Will they ever get to meet?<br /><br />The time anomalies make the film confusing at times, but the story of two star-crossed lovers who transcend time is wonderful.  Bullock and Reeves make film magic in their scenes together and when they write each other letters.  My favorite scene is the one where they slow dance during Kate's birthday party.  The song they play during that scene is great.  It's difficult to write a review without giving details away (though I'm sure some people have done that already), but all I can say is that this is a great romantic film, one of the best I've seen this year along with The Notebook and The Phantom of the Opera.  I highly recommend this DVD.</p></body></html>

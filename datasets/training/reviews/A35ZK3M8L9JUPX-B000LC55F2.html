<meta name="summary" content="The Prestige"></head><body><p>In the end of the Nineteenth Century, in London, Robert Angier, his beloved wife Julia McCullough and Alfred Borden are friends and assistants of a magician. When Julia accidentally dies during a performance, Robert blames Alfred for her death and they become enemies. Both become famous and rival magicians, sabotaging the performance of the other on the stage. When Alfred performs a successful trick, Robert becomes obsessed trying to disclose the secret of his competitor with tragic consequences. The work is epic in sweep, beautifully filmed, and strongly acted. A movie with the power of becoming a cult classic, ''The Prestige'' is magical. In every sense of the word.</p></body></html>

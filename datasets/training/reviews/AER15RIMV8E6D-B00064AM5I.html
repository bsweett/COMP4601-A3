<meta name="summary" content="An Awesome Film!!!"></head><body><p>This is a very funny film about a laid-back guy named Peter LaFleur, who is about to lose his decaying gym called Average Joe's because the gym across the street, Globo-Gym owned by White Goodman is a lot better. Peter and his friends must raise $50,000 in 30 days in order to redeem the gym, or White will foreclose on it and turn it into a parking lot. The Average Joe's decide to become a dodgeball team, and the winner gets $50,000. Will the Average Joe's beat White's team and win the money? I highly recommend DODGEBALL: A TRUE UNDERDOG STORY!!!</p></body></html>

The colors are vibrant and the music is terrific.  The new numbers written for this one fit in perfectly.  I do prefer Lake's Tracy more than newcomer Nikki, but that is more of a personal thing.  Travolta seems like he is having a good time, and Pfeiffer and Walken do great in their parts.  It was nice to have the Waters and Lake cameos to tie the movies together.  I think the original is well worth seeing as well.  Along with Sweeney Todd, this has been a good year for the musical for me.  This movie really shines in blu-ray.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Could've been Murray's best."></head><body><p>This is very close to being Bill Murray's best film. You have to look to &quot;Scrooged&quot; for that. But lets face it, Bill was handicapped a bit here.<p>First, he had to play opposite Andie McDowell. Unfortunately, Ms  McDowell is just this side of a lump of clay as acting ability  goes.<p>Second, the final act of the film. Murray has to be a nice guy. Not  his forte by any means. And the rest of the cast has to pick up the  &quot;funny&quot; for the remainder of the movie. Fortunately, by that time  you've had such fun that you barely notice that flaw.<p>All in all, a very  good movie that could've been great.</p></body></html>

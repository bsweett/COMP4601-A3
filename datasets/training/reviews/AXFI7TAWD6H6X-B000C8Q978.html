<meta name="summary" content="Ok film but not one of the best"></head><body><p>I have been anticipating the release of "Broken Flowers" for a few weeks now. Ever since "Lost in Translation", I have fell in love with Bill Murray's films all over again. His film roles of lately have been quirky and very interesting to watch. Unfortunately I can't really say the same for "Broken Flowers". The premise of the film is interesting. Don Johnston (Bill Murray) discovers through a mysterious letter that he (supposedly) has a 20 year old son. With the insistence of his neighbor Winston (Jeffrey Wright), Don goes out on a search to find out who wrote the letter and who his son is. He pays a visit to Sharon Stone, Frances Conroy, Jessica Lange, and Tilda Swinton.<br /><br />I found myself a bit bored with the film. The traveling scenes were not necessary. I would have liked to have seen less of Don's visit with Frances Conroy (which for me dragged on longer than it should have been)and more with Tilda Swinton. I thought Don's past with Tilda's character Penny appealed to me the most. I would have liked to have known more about their past relationship. Bill's performance in this film seemed kind of a drag. Jeffrey Wright as Winston stole the film for me. I liked the premise of the film. It is too bad the writing was rather weak.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An excellent thriller..."></head><body><p>This movie kept me on the edge of my seat for the entire time and was great fun! It is a clever, well-directed thriller that also features great performances, especially from Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones. <p>The Fugitive, which is based on a TV series, is the story of a Dr. Richard Kimble (Harrison Ford), a man wrongly convicted of brutally murdering his wife. After the bus carrying him to prison manages to crash into a train (impressive special effects on the crash scene), Kimble escapes then attempts to solve the mystery of who actually killed his wife. At the same time, however, he has to keep on the run from an obsessive detective (Tommy Lee Jones) who is as determined to find him as he is to stay free. <p>There are many exciting twists and turns in the plot, which involves a one-armed man and a medical fraud...and to say any more about it would be to give too much away. Anyhow, this is one of the best recent thrillers - it has some great scenes, good action sequences, some comic moments, great acting (Ford and Jones are perfect...you simply root for whoever is on screen at the time), and is not TOO violent (although some of the initial scenes which show the wife being murdered are pretty grusome). This is one of the few recent Hollywood blockbusters that actually deserves its popularity - see it and enjoy!</p></body></html>

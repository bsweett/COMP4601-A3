<meta name="summary" content="So THIS is why everyone loves Nolan."></head><body><p>I have heard people rave about this movie since it came out.<br />Every great director has at least one defining film.<br />Speilberg had....lots of them. (Poltergeist, Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones etc...)<br />Cameron had Aliens and Terminator.<br />So I was anxious to see where Nolan really established himself in Hollywood.<br />And....<br />Let's get to it.<br /><br />The good.<br />Excellent acting.<br />Spot on pacing.<br />Great score.<br />It's one of the more artful films I've seen in recent memory.<br />It has a ton of twists and turns.<br />How the story is told is simply masterful, I can see a lot of Inception in this movie.<br /><br />The bad?<br />People may be thrown by the way the story is told but if you can't pay attention then don't even bother trying to watch this movie.<br />That's it for the bad really.<br /><br />As far as art movies go or even crime, thriller movies go.<br />This one is about as perfect as it gets.<br />Stunning from first frame to last.<br />Memento comes.....highly recommended.</p></body></html>

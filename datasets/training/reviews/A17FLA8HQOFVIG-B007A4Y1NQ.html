<meta name="summary" content="A comedy with depth, laughs, insights and CREATIVITY!"></head><body><p>I avoided this 1999 film when it was in the theaters.  It looked just plain silly to me.  And yet, it's received accolades from critics everywhere.  And so I decided to catch up on what everyone was making such a fuss about and see the DVD.  Oh my!  What a film!  I've never seen anything so innovative and creative in my life!<p>John Cusak stars as an out-of-work puppeteer.  Cameron Diaz is his wife.  Catherine Keener is the sassy woman they both find attractive.  And John Malkovich plays a version of himself.  All are excellent actors.  And all are exceptional.  How the writer, Charlie Kaufman, ever thought up the premise is amazing.  And the director, Spike Jonze, certainly knew how to make it all fit together.<p>This is a comedy with depth.  And the laughs and insights keep getting better.  There's an office building with a floor numbered 7-1/2.  It's only 4 feet high and everyone who works there has to walk around half stooped over.  Then there's a secret doorway behind a file cabinet.  When a person crawls in, he or she falls down a tunnel and finds himself or herself inside the brain of the actor John Malkovich for a mere 15 minutes.  Soon, Catherine Keener and John Cusak are selling tickets to people who want to experience this.  Soon, too, Cameron Diaz gets hooked  - so much so that, with an interesting gender-bender twist of the plot, she finds herself being John Malkovich while making love to Catherine Keener.  And that's just one of the many sub-plots.<p>Sound confusing?  Well it's not.  It might sound silly, but as a viewer I was completely there with the story all the way, letting myself enjoy the twists and turns of the plot that just kept getting better as this intriguing tale moved along.  It's all very surreal.  And it's absolutely brilliant.<p>Later, I thought about all the themes it touched on.  The puppeteer theme had to do with manipulation, both with puppets and with real people.  Everyone was manipulated in this film, and different people pulled the strings at different times.  It also had to do with what it means to be a celebrity.  And what, actually, is identity? <p>I loved this film and hoped the DVD would have some good special features.  I yearned for insight into the making of the film and I wished there were interviews with the actors.  Instead, there's scene with an &quot;extra&quot; who had the job of driving a car back and forth all night so that the headlights would give the appropriate background for one of the shots.  And a scene where the director feels sick and throws up.  However, when I think about it, what can I expect from such off-beat filmmakers?<p>This is the most refreshing film to come out of Hollywood that I've ever seen.  It might not be for everyone but I thought it was great!  It therefore gets one of my highest recommendations.</p></body></html>

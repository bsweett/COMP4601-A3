<meta name="summary" content="Chris Evans was the only one that worked"></head><body><p>While I didn't expect much based on what has come out of Hollywood calling itself superhero movies in the last 10 years, I was still disappointed in how flat Captain America was.  Chris Evans made an excellent Captain America (IMHO), but the supporting cast came up too short.  I expected more from Tommy Lee Jones and way more from Hugo Weaving.  I love just about every character Hugo Weaving has ever played in his career, but his portrayal of the villain bored me to tears.  Maybe it was the directing?  Even the feel of the portrayal of the Nazis were off.  They got the look right, but that's about it.  I kept thinking that someone like Steven Spielberg or George Lucas would have done a much better job at making this movie pop.<br /><br />Captain America had potential, but it seemed like the powers that be were so intent on just getting it out in theatres to start working on an Avenger movie, that they kind of just threw it together and got lucky with choosing Chris Evans as the lead.  It's not the worst superhero movie I've seen (Punisher would be that), but like the majority of the other superhero movies that have come out in the past decade, it had nowhere near the depth and intensity that the new Batman movies (with Christian Bale) had nor did it have the fresh, fun, thrill and charm of the Superman movies (with Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman) that came out in the late 70s.  Chris Evans was a great choice for Captain America.... everyone else?  Not so much.  I thought the movie was a bit boring and for a superhero movie that is not good!</p></body></html>

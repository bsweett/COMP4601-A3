<meta name="summary" content="Familiar, But Cute and Delightful Romantic Comedy in NYC"></head><body><p>From the Scene One in which Will Smith with his easygoing charms directly talks to us viewers, we know where the film is going.  Will Smith is Alex Hitchens, "date doctor" who gives tips for males to arrange the dates with the opposite sex.  And believe it or not, every "client" is satisfied with his job.<br /><br />The film has two stories, both of which are not particularly original, but told with a delightful touch and considerable energy.  In one, Alex himself falls in love with a gossip columnist Sara (Eva Mendes), who strictly guards herself against unwelcome males coming to her.  But of course, Alex is an exception -- his persistent wooing (even using walkie-talkie)is so irreisitible.<br /><br />In the other, we find more unique story and talents -- Alex is given a hard task, as hard as Mission Impossible.  That is, to guide one accountant Albert (Kevin James) successfully to his goal -- a date with a celebrity, beautiful and (very) rich female Allegra (Amber Valletta).  The big problem is, Albert, so smitten, so good-natured, so timid, cannot do one single right thing even while having a lunch, kind of a guy who drops fried potatoes onto the floor, and kicks a can of coke while picking up them.  It seems Albert (and a terrible dancer too) is totally a hopeless case, but Alex Hitchens knows what to do.<br /><br />The direction of Andy Tennant ('Ever After') is a strange mixture of slapsticks, witty dialogues, and romantic mood.  The tone is inconsistent, but that doesn't bother us.  The story is predictable, and the ending is very weak, but still the characters, or the actors, are all charming.  And very funny and likable Kevin James as Albert steals almost every scene in the film.<br /><br />Probably, however, the best part of the film is the location itself, well-chosen spots in New York City.  A bit familiar as romantic comedy perhaps, but very cute 'Hitch' with equally cute characters reminds us that this city is and will be a beloved place for every film lover.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Den of Iniquity and Vilolence"></head><body><p>"Sin City," based on a popular series of graphic novels, captures the signature comic book style of creator Frank Miller, which involves black and white images with highlights of color for dramatic effect, extreme violence, brutality, misogyny, and torture.  Miller doesn't pull his punches.  Even Superman and Batman would wince at the parameters Miller has widened in the field of comic art.<br /> "Sin City" is co-directed by Miller, Robert Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarentino.  Its cast includes Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Benicio Del Toro, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Brittany Murphy, Nick Stahl, Powers Boothe, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Carla Gugino.<br /> Basin City, the "sin city" of the title, is an extension of hell where the underbelly of society flourishes.  The police are either ineffective or corrupt, prostitutes -- heavily armed -- rule their own red light district, and shootings and murders occur with the frequency of flashing neon.<br /> The two-disc Blu-ray edition contains both the theatrical and a recut, extended, unrated version.  There are a slew of bonus extras to make fans of Miller's creation happy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A powerhouse of a crime drama"></head><body><p>Frank Lucas is king.  No one disputes that.  They dispute it, they die.  Richie Roberts is the sole exception: an honest cop--think Serpico on steroids--who is dedicating his life and career to bringing down America's drug kingpin.  And nothing--absolutely nothing--is going to stop these two men...except each other.<br /><br />To say "American Gangster" is a thrill to watch is, quite simply, a horrible understatement.  Ridley Scott's film rockets along (despite it's epic length) at break-neck speed, fueled by stellar performances from Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe (and when the two men meet, in the interrogation room, you'll be so enthralled you'll have to try not to giggle in excitement).  The supporting cast, too, is spectacular: Ruby Dee as Lucas's mother is a wonder; Josh Brolin is absolutely chilling as a corrupt cop; Cuba Gooding Jr., in his brief role, is fantastic (we can forgive him for his last dozen movies or so).  The rest of the cast is fantastic as well.<br /><br />I'm not saying "American Gangster" is perfect; it has its flaws, such as a couple of unnecessary side plots, and the fact that Roberts's story parallel's "Serpico" so much (it's a true story, so we can't change the facts; however, having just watched "Serpico" not too long ago, it was stuck in my head).  But...well, let's face it, you're coming to this movie to see two powerhouse actors go up against each other.  Remember Robert De Niro and Al Pacino in "Heat"?  Same thing, except with heroin.  And you're gonna get what you want, what you're expecting, plus a whole hell of a lot more.  "American Gangster" isn't quite on the classic level, but it's damn good cinema, an expertly-made film that brings a new (true) twist to the gangster movie.  Buy it, rent it, whatever--just see it.</p></body></html>

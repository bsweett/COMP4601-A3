<meta name="summary" content="Only for Non-Cynics...Romantic Serendipity Found Through Handwritten Letters and a Time Warp"></head><body><p>Not since Jeannot Szwarc's gooey "Somewhere in Time" (1980) have I seen a movie so willing to suspend credibility and logic for the sake of conveying an idealistic romance, but Argentinean director Alejandro Agresti (in his American film bow) and screenwriter David Auburn somehow manage to keep their convoluted fable afloat despite the layers of fantasy-driven contrivance. Underneath it all, the 2006 movie is really an old-fashioned 1950's-style woman's picture, and one wonders what Douglas Sirk could have done with the material in a lavish Ross Hunter production. Instead, we are given a precocious, time-jumping tale detailing the improbable romance between Alex Wyler, an angst-driven architect who has become a condo developer, and Kate Forster, a lonely doctor. Their common thread is the unique glass house designed by Alex's father that sits literally on a lake near Chicago, where both have lived at different times. They correspond through handwritten letters, but the twist is that they are existing two years apart and have only a magical mailbox to transcend the time difference.<br /><br />The fantastical premise sounds silly, and to some degree it is, but in a surprisingly effective manner, the filmmakers and cast take it all quite seriously. It's all about execution and the emotional subtleties in the script. Luckily, Auburn dances around the credibility issues with a swooning sense of romance. The externals capture the feeling as well - Alar Kivilo's crisp, autumnal-to-wintry cinematography and Meg Everist's set decorations both capture Chicago at its most cinematic; and Rachel Portman's evocative score filled with music from baby boomer icons like Carole King and Paul McCartney. There is a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu in Sandra Bullock's Kate since the actress has played variations of the same lonely girl over the years, though she has gratefully dropped her perky demeanor for a more resonant performance. Keanu Reeves is sincere as Alex, though a bit too overtly new-age-male to compensate for his innate inscrutability. Still, aside from Bullock's sharply vituperative turn in Paul Haggis' "Crash", this is probably the best work either has done in a while.<br /><br />Individually, Reeves and Bullock convey the solitude of their characters with a minimum of fuss, and when they do connect, they generate real chemistry in rather creative ways. That's what really matters with a movie like this. The supporting cast consists mostly of unsurprising stock characters, in particular, Dylan Walsh as Kate's insecure intended, Morgan, and Lynn Collins as Alex's anxious co-worker, Mona. There are three international veterans who inhabit their roles with more verve and individuality - Shohreh Aghdashloo worldly wise as Kate's workaholic colleague; Christopher Plummer (who coincidentally co-starred in "Somewhere in Time") hammy as Alex's irascible father; and Dutch actress Willeke van Ammelrooy (of "Antonia's Line") full of romanticism as Kate's widowed mother. As contrived as it is (and if you have seen Brad Anderson's "Happy Accidents", you will notice plot similarities), the ending does satisfy in a way loyal to its genre. The movie is definitely a wallow but a well-done one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Intrigue, corruption, love and tension in every scene"></head><body><p>This 1942 film is a classic, and rightly so.  Staring Humphrey Bogart,<br />Ingrid Bergman and Paul Heinreid, it was originally just another one<br />of the more than 50 films turned out each year by each of the major<br />studios that dominated Hollywood in those days.  It's release<br />coincidentally coincided with the Nazi occupation of France, and its<br />theme and its timeless love story caught the public's<br />imagination.<p>Casablanca in French Morocco is under French rule and<br />one of the places in the world where refuges can get safe passage<br />visas to go on to Lisbon and eventually to America and freedom.  It is<br />seething with intrigue and corruption.  Humphrey Bogart is an<br />ex-patriot American citizen who runs Rick's Cafe, where much of the<br />commerce takes place.  Peter Lorre is a smuggler, Sidney Greenstreet<br />is a black marketeer, and Martin Dooley is the piano player known as<br />Sam.<p>When, one evening Ingrid Bergman comes in to the cafe on the<br />arm of her husband, Paul Heinreid, and asks the piano player to<br />&quot;play it Sam&quot;, he reluctantly plays &quot;As Time Goes<br />By.&quot; This melody which is played throughout the movie, is the<br />glue that defines the romance.  There's electricity between the<br />lovers.  There's intrigue and double dealing.  Something exciting<br />happens in each scene.  And the acting is so good that it brought me<br />right into Casablanca.  The story is always clear.  The danger is<br />always there.  The tension sizzles.<p>One particularly meaningful<br />scene was when some Nazi soldiers gather round the piano and sing an<br />ominous song to the &quot;Fatherland&quot;.  It makes everyone in the<br />Rick's cafe very uncomfortable.  That's when Paul Heinried instructs<br />the orchestra to play the French national anthem, the<br />&quot;Marseilles&quot;. Everyone starts to sing.  The Nazis are<br />silenced.  The music takes over.  I found my eyes filled with<br />tears.<p>The video I rented included a &quot;made for TV program&quot;<br />that featured interviews with some of the original writers and<br />recollections from people working on the set at the time.  There was<br />an interview with the man who did the music. He said that when he<br />wrote that into the script he actually felt tears running down his<br />face.  It was the same powerful emotion that I felt too.<p>The movie<br />was shot in black and white.  It was also shot in a studio in<br />Hollywood.  The airplane scene used a cardboard cutout of a plane and<br />hired midgets dressed as mechanics.  Shot from a distance and through<br />a fog it was realistic and served the same kind of purpose of<br />today's video imaging and special effects.<p>Of course all the<br />principals are dead, but their celluloid images in a timeless classic<br />film lingers on.</p></body></html>

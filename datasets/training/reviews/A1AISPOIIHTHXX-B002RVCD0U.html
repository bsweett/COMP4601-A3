<meta name="summary" content="Great presentation for a mediocre film"></head><body><p>Terminator is like one of those franchises where if there's enough rumors and speculation about a potential sequel in the future, you can bet some screenwriter or producer is like "hey yeah! we can make a new..." and find someone with the interest in doing it. I mean Terminator 1 and 2 are considered, T2 especially, to be classics so any director would most likely snap at the chance in doing another installment even if the fanbase or the story doesn't need it and so we have Terminator Salvation, a film directed by McG who's predominantly known for directing Charlie's Angels on the big screen. So how's the film? It's strangely not...bad? Well I shouldn't say that as there's clear problems with the film right from the get-go whether it's script-related or just the direction in the film,there's so many off elements that it feels like the good stuff has to battle it out with the bad stuff just to save face. It's not an utter travesty like many claimed but the movie just does so much wrong that it's like doing a guitar solo and for every awesome moment, there's just dead notes.<br /><br />The year is 2018 (a year shown in red against a black background which made it strangely hard to read for me) and Judgement Day has happened leaving mankind to fight to survive not only in terms of supplies and shelter but in their war against the machines developed by Skynet. Found wandering the wasteland is Marcus Wright, a former death row inmate now walking a world he's unfamiliar with and with company he's just met, namely Kyle Reese and small mute girl Star. Also in the former world fighting the machines is John Connor, who some believe to be the savior for humanity while others believe he's just nutty (though we strangely don't get that side of the conflict in the movie much). Marcus and John will eventually meet and form an unlikely partnership as they try to take down Skynet.<br /><br />My problems with the story strangely can be best evidenced in the "Maximum Movie Mode", the innovative commentary/picture-in-picture/analysis of the film you might've seen in the "Watchmen" release. Near the end of the film, McG shows us 2 deleted scenes: the first being one uninterrupted take of John Connor delivering a speech prior to the infiltration on Skynet and urging them not to attack. It's a more personal and indeed more upfront Connor and almost humanizes him more, especially when he brings up his mother Sarah, a woman thought crazy now proven to have been right all along and director just took it out. Then there's the 2nd: Kyle Reese, played by Anton Yelchin, reaches into his pocket and takes out a photo of Sarah Connor, the familiar one we all know from the end of the first film. This could've had huge symbolic weight to it. Imagine it: you literally hold your future in your hand, that being a woman you fall for, a woman you conceive a child with and a woman you die for protecting her and all this for somebody what...late teens, early 20's? Yet it's taken out. Then there's nods to the old films like the line "I'll be back", which previously brought with it impending doom (first one) or a welcome rescue hero moment (second movie)...here? It's just any old line of dialogue. They even bring back Guns N Roses "You Could Be Mine" for no other reason than to go "hey remember this from T2?" Then there's weird plot elements that are either missing (what happened to owning dogs to warn them of approaching terminators? Or was that later? Or how a gigantic-ass Transformer-sized robot can creep up on a shack in the middle of nowhere. What, was he on his tiptoes?<br /><br />So obviously you can see I don't like the story but how's the action you ask? Quite good actually...for the first bit. Metal Gear stealth robot moment aside, that whole section which culminates in a high-speed car chase on the highway is awesome and the digital effects are better than ever and with an eye that's noticed bad and good CGI over the years since Jurassic Park, this is some fine CGI,though the surprise cameo at the end is incredibly dodgy. But the film kind of loses steam after a character is imprisoned and 2 others captured and even then the action almost feels ordinary. Acting-wise it's...fine with Christian Bale still doing that "smokes 10 packs a day" voice he used for Batman or he just simply whispers while Bryce Dallas Howard is barely given anything to do, ditto for Common who we see has an arc involving a dead brother but that just disappears. One pulling the weight is Sam Worthington, now seemingly the hottest thing in sci-fi thanks to this, "Avatar" and forthcoming "Clash of the Titans" whose accent occasionally wavers but delivers on a good character arc. And boy-in-a-man's-world Anton Yelchin does a serviceable job as Kyle Reese though was oddly better as Chekov in "Star Trek".<br /><br />Ever since commentaries entered the DVD special features, many directors utilized this bonus to comment on the filmmaking process, scene inspiration or working with a certain actor. Now with Bluray, studios are enhancing it a bit further with what's called "Maximum Movie Mode", a sort of commentary hybrid that mixes picture-in-picture showcasing the filming of a certain scene compared to the final image, storyboards and concept art, interviews by the cast and crew and more prominently, a presentation done by the director that points out certain elements on screen or dissects a certain element. While it's certainly innovative and handy, it can also lead to some parts being missed entirely such as the scene where Marcus discovers the truth about himself (the part spoiled in the trailers) and instead of commenting on the concept behind the scene and the discussion it creates, McG talks about the different acting styles of the 2 and just wants the "camera to do the talking". The rest of the special features are functional though they're hardly on the same level of detail as Star Trek's bonus features was. As far as the director's cut is concerned, like another reviewer pointed out, there's some small omissions and some little moments taken out but it isn't a radical re-design of the film so don't expect the same kind of shift that tends to accompany a director's cut.<br /><br />Is Terminator Salvation worth a purchase? Yes and no though I'm sure people will lean towards a no. It has nothing as far as the humanity elements from T2 yet it's way better than Terminator 3 so this is either hopefully a stumbling block in this "reboot" if you will or we're going to suffer 2 more average-but-could-be-better entries. Either way, it's a Bluray showcase, it's a home theater showcase, just not a great movie.</p></body></html>

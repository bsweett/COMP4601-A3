I was sad to see that the guy who escaped the first Hostel did not last long in this one, and this movie is different because the trio of protagonists in this movie are girls, not guys, so a different technique had to be used to lure them to the Hostel.<br /><br />I almost fell out of my seat when I recognized two actors from 'Desperate Housewives'. This movie is very gory like the first one, though there was also a bit more in-depth examination (showing the Hostel as a business, and the people in charge, etc) I applauded the 'heroine' when she figured out a way to get out of the Hostel alive, that was rather creative on her part. And like the guy from the last Hostel movie, she figured out how to get vengeance on at least one person. I actually liked the plot more than the torture part, because honestly, the torture was SICK. 2.5/5 stars.</p></body></html>

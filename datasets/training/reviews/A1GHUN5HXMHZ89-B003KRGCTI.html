He reads the Bible daily and although he may have to kill others to survive, he keeps his faith true. Gary Oldman is an unscrupulous man that desires the last King James Bible in Washington's possession no matter how he has to get it. He sends gang after gang to retrieve it to no avail. When he finally joins in the hunt he finally obtains it, but sometimes even a well read person can not read what's coming in the way of God's ironic retribution. My only objection to the movie is Washington kills a cat with the same lack of remorse that he dispatches the vultures of society. That scene did not improve the movie except for cat haters which I fully expect to give me negative votes. Basic extras and good quality picture and sound.

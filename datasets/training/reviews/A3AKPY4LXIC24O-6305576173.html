<meta name="summary" content="Tonight Only Dr. F. Frankenstein Presents The Creature"></head><body><p>For fans of Horror and Comedy no other movie pays more homage to both genres.  Mel Brooks hilarious spoof of Frankenstein is undoubtedly one of the funniest films ever made.  The casting is incredible (especially Marty Feldman as Igor) and the gags will have you rolling in the grave, um, on the floor.  With everything from sight gags to overt sexual innuendo (both Brooks trademarks) this comedy will have you gasping for breath.  The monster on stage doing a dance routine with Dr. F., the lonely blind man (Gene Hackman) who was going to make espresso, the luscious Terri Garr &quot;assisting&quot; whenever she can.  I know this is one of my favorite comedies, as well as one of my favorite movies.  It's made even better if you watch the 1931 Universal Frankenstein (with Boris Karloff as the monster) before it.  For fans of Horror, of Comedy, or just plain old good movies.</p></body></html>

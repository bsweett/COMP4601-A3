<meta name="summary" content="Actually More Funny Than Not Funny"></head><body><p>I caught this one on HBO over the weekend and I laughed hard at least a dozen times, which is exactly about a dozen more times than I thought I would. Will Ferrell is getting a little annoying to me the more I see him in films (loved him on SNL), but he gave me a few chuckles in this one. I loved all the cameos and some of the dirty humor, but this is one you won't want to see more than once or twice.</p></body></html>

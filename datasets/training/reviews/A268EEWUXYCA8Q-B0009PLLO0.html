<meta name="summary" content="Be Warned!"></head><body><p>For those who did enjoy Oliver Stone's Alexander (I, for the record was not one of them), be warned that this is probably one of the few times in the history of Director's Cuts that the film is cut down from the Theatrical cut.  Due to what Oliver Stone perceived as America's disinterest in this movie based on the bisexual themes involved, the Director's Cut is devoid of many, if not all, references to this.  If you are a fan of the movie, make sure you know this prior to purchasing.  Personally, I think it's a bit shady of them to release a Director's Cut when the moniker is usually used for movies that had scenes cut from the theatrical version restored.<br /><br />Also, in reference to the two DVD editions.  This edition is on one disc.  For the theatrical cut, I suppose because it's less than 10 minutes longer, is on two discs for the movie itself.<br /><br />About the movie, though.  I guess this movie has been deeply polarizing for audience members.  I'm not sure if its because of the bisexual themes or if its because it just wasn't a good movie.  I notice people defending the film talk about the subtle nuances that Oliver Stone employed in his story.  I noticed these as well, and I applaud some of his use not only of symbolism but also imagery for a concrete reason.  However, subtle nuances and symbolism alone does not a good movie make.  Nor does it make a good epic necessarily.<br /><br />When I saw this movie in the theatre, I noticed a few people leave pretty much as soon as any bisexual themes were hinted at.  The bisexual themes did not bother me in the least.  I want to get that out of the way so that I'm not immediately discounted.  I was completely aware (as I assumed most people were) that it is generally known that Alexander had feelings for his friend Hephastos.  In every single history class from junior high to College had made that pretty clear, either overtly or subtly.  If you are going to make a movie about this situation, however, you have to do it carefully.  Not only because of the apparent tumultous culture we live in today, but also because it can come across as silly.<br /><br />In Alexander, this is exactly what happened.  Instead of seriously examining these issues, which would have made a very interesting to watch character in Alexander, Oliver Stone made a melodrama.  He turned Alexander into an angsty teen who bats his eyes while looking at Hephastos longingly behind locks of silly hair.  There's no emotion there besides soap opera melodrama.  Honestly, if you replaced the fact that Alexander was fawning over a female instead of Hephastos, I would still have this reaction.  It was executed very poorly.  And not only that, but seemed to be tacked on as if to make a comment and nothing more.<br /><br />But its not only this that warrants my bad review.  The silliness did not stop with the love triangle.  First off, casting a woman a year older than Colin Farrel to play his mother is just odd.  Not only that, but to give her such a horribly done slavish/Transylvanian accent just undermined any sort of seriousness.  Then there's everyone else's accents that seem to change as the movie progresses.  For an epic movie, the battles are very important and the battles here were filmed so haphazardly and chaotically that yes it probably was a good representation of war, but as a movie it just doesn't work.  How can you root for the good side when you can't tell who is winning because everyone looks the same?  The movie began on a rocky start (Val Kilmer as the father figure was just as ham-handed as anything else) and only went down hill from there.  I'll admit, the first maybe half of the movie was vaguely intersting if melodramatic.  But when Alexander reaches India, things just spiraled into boredom.  My group was checking their watches, wishing for it to be over.<br /><br />My gripe, then, is a more moderate one.  I don't care what the film is about.  But it was not done well.  It was boring, and for an epic film that is the one thing it shouldn't be.  For a movie to hold your attention for 3 hours or more it has to be exciting.  Alexander failed in this, as it also did in exploring his relationship with Hephastos and his wife.  It seemed hacked on as if for the only reason than a political one to say, hey look Alexander had feelings for his male friend.  In the end, a boring and melodramatic movie.</p></body></html>

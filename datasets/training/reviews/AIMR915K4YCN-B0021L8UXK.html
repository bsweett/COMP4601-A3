<meta name="summary" content="Welcome To Crazytown..."></head><body><p>THE CRAZIES takes place in Ogden Marsh, Iowa. In the course of a weekend, this small, idyllic town is turned into a hellish nightmare-world of insanity, murder, and ultimate doom! It appears that something is transforming the once-peaceful residents into homicidal maniacs, leaving only a small band of survivors! This is a fantastic remake / update of the original 1973 George Romero classic. While I love Romero's version, I enjoyed this one even more, due to it's high suspense / terror factor. THE CRAZIES is right up there w/ the DAWN OF THE DEAD, THE HILLS HAVE EYES, and LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT remakes! Timothy Olyphant is great as the sheriff, and modern horror goddess, Radha Mitchell (PITCH BLACK, SILENT HILL, ROGUE) is excellent as the sheriff's wife and town doctor. A total blast!...</p></body></html>

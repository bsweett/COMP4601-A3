<meta name="summary" content="Excellent action sequences and an all around magnificent movie"></head><body><p>The Blood Diamond has double meaning.  An extremely bloody war is being funded by diamonds, and the stars of the movie are after a huge stone that has a red tint to it.  Leonardo Dicaprio is after the diamond and Djimon Hounsou (named Solomon in the movie) agrees to show him where it is, but only goes along with Dicaprio so that he can find his son.  Solomon's son has been been taken and made into a 10 year old rebel soldier.  Jennifer Connelly plays a journalist and does a great job of using her charm to help forget about the war that is going on, even if it is just for a moment.  The best parts are the action scenes.  Solomon will do whatever he has to to get his son back, and likewise for Dicaprio with the diamond.  It all leads to a very exciting ending.<br /><br />There is great drama, a great story, and marvelous acting from everybody, but the action sequences stood out the most to me.  The rebels seem to enjoy killing everyone and anyone.  When they show up, expect to see some intense shoutouts.  The 2 fight scenes are also good, mainly because Djimon Hounsou is such a superb actor.  I wouldn't have minded seeing more of his rage.  Dicaprio also gives an extraordinary performance.  He may be better in this than he was in 'The Aviator'.<br /><br />This is the best movie I have seen in at least a couple months, and I am a hardcore movie junkie.  I don't like giving away too much in my reviews, in fact I always try to give away as little as possible.  My rating sums up how I feel the best.  This movie gets a perfect 5/5 from me.  It is relentless, and I couldn't look away for a second.  I can't believe I waited so long to finally watch this.</p></body></html>

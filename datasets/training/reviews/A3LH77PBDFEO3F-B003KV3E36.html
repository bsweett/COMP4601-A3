<meta name="summary" content="Graphically (and necessarily violent) film."></head><body><p>I downloaded the unbox version of Rambo to my Tivo (which by the way gives excellent quality to watch on an HDTV) and watched it last night.<br /><br />My wife is not a Stallone fan at all, and she didn't "want to watch any Rambo movie", so I started it without her, but soon she was in and watching and yelling (my sweetheart is a movie yeller) "Did you see that, did you see that?"  She like me was instantly hooked into the realistic feel of the action scenes and the evil of the bad guys.<br /><br />One thing I noticed that for all the realistic look to the battle scenes, they had a weird camera effect of old battlefield films from Viet Nam, and WWII. I don't want to spoil the film by giving away the story line so I'll just say this, Rambo is even more graphically violent than 300 <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPLW">300 (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, Gladiator <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009QTS1M">Gladiator - Extended Edition (Three-Disc Extended Edition)</a>, or Braveheart <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W8OM5Y">Braveheart (Special Collector's Edition)</a>, so if you are put off by violence of every kind, blood and gore (and brief glimpses of perversion), then this is not a film to even consider watching. However, it is a surprisingly moving film, that reminds us that there are bad guys in the world more evil than we can readily imagine. It is also a moving tale of acceptance for the protagonist. It is an action film that doesn't waste time on pointless dialogue except to help you understand who the characters are, rather than to be the story.<br /><br />So here's the deal, this is not a movie for everyone, but every one should understand at least on some level the lessons that this movie teaches.<br /><br />But that's just me.</p></body></html>

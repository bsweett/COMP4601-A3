It's tough because: a) You need a dirty word thesaurus to avoid filing a review with more expletives than an Andrew Dice Clay rant, and b) It's hard to work when you're constantly giggling to yourself incessantly.<br /><br />"Team America: World Police" is the anti-blockbuster. The characters are marionette puppets whose strings are in plain sight because it's funny. The voice-overs don't sound anything close to the celebrities and politicians they're representing, because it's funny. But much of the dialogue--with the exception of the cursing--could be pulled straight from any Jerry Bruckheimer film...because it's funny.<br /><br />"South Park" creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker offend everyone in "Team America"--foreign and domestic leaders, conservatives and liberals, outspoken Hollywood mouthpieces and...outspoken Hollywood mouthpieces. But one thing they are clearly critical of is the United States foreign policy mentality of kick ass now, ask questions later. If there's a hell, Parker and Stone will be living in the penthouse.<br /><br />But let's talk about the puppets. The marionettes look slick. When they speak, the movements of their mouths fluidly match their words. In other words, they put Milli Vanilli to shame. And the stuff that they can't do without herky jerky silliness, namely Kung Fu fighting and love making, comes off as so hilarious that it's almost too bad all movie actors couldn't be replaced by puppets.<br /><br />Team America is a no-holds-barred freedom fighting force that's called in whenever there's an international emergency. They live in Mt. Rushmore, drive souped up super vehicles and wield rocket launchers. The team is led by Spottswoode, a debonair smooth talker with an ambiguous sexual preference. When one of the team members is killed by terrorists (who speak a broken record of "Jihad bakakakaka"), Spottswoode recruits Broadway thespian Gary Johnston to "act" his way past the terrorists and infiltrate their treacherous network. Unbeknownst to Team America in the beginning, North Korean leader Kim Jung II, is secretly supplying terrorists with WMDs. Kimmy is probably the most hysterically rendered---and most un-PC character. I can't give out more information without committing a hate crime.<br /><br />While Team America takes out their targets, they also take out many people and international treasures that aren't their target, a.k.a collateral damage. They take out the Eiffel Tower, the Sphinx and thousands of innocent puppets. And when they do, they draw the ire of the Film Actors Guild (an acronym I don't need to dwell on...but one that "Team America" does). An obviously spoof on the Screen Actors Guild, it comprises Alec Baldwin, Tim Robbins, Susan Sarandon and other celebrities who use their notoriety as a political soapbox. Of course, now, actors are using their notoriety as a soapbox to speak out against "Team America" in some sort of ironic countermeasures. Confused? Me too.<br /><br />If you don't know anything about "Team America: World Police," when you step into the theater, you'll be like a rich kid on Christmas morning. You'll get every damned thing you want, from hot puppet sex to gory puppet deaths, playful songs with illicit lyrics and more. No strings attached.</p></body></html>

It's felt like a long time, especially due to the pushed back release date, but it was certainly worth it.<br /><br />V For Vendetta is based upon the graphic novel written by Alan Moore, who is generally considered to be one of the greatest comics writers of all time.  Moore's stories are known for their political intrigue and amazing ability to look at real-life situations in ways very few other forms of entertainment in any media can.  While the story has changed a little from the 1982 book, the 2006 film still captures the message perfectly.<br /><br />Set in London, England in the near future, it turns out things have gone very wrong in the world.  Due to the military advances of the United States, the world has suffered through a terrible nuclear war.  England is one of the few countries to survive, which is lucky for them, seeing as how they were allies of the US and aided in their military campaign.  For years, there was chaos and panic due to the lack of resources, and things didn't calm down until a new political party was able to come to power.  Led by Adam Sutler (John Hurt), the party promised peace and tranquility.  Unfortunately, in return for peace, the citiznes of England gave up their rights.  Quarantine zones were set up, curfews were enacted, and non-whites, gays, and non-Christians (anyone different) was deemed dangerous, rounded up, and taken away.  Furthermore, free speech, which includes political activism and speaking out against the government, was outlawed.  A secret police force was also set up.<br /><br />One evening, a young woman named Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman) left her home after curfew and was assaulted by the secret police.  They planned on raping her, but a masked vigilante known only as V (Hugo Weaving) came to her rescue.  Wearing a Guy Fawkes mask and black leather garments, V effortlessly took out the trio of cops using only knives and his knowledge of the martial arts.  It turns out that V is somewhat of a Batman-type character in the sense that he can effectively use simple weapons, karate, and manipulation of his surroundings to take out his enemies, but he has a definite political agenda.  V is tired of the fascism and means to bring about a better type of goverment.  Using extensive knowledge of the government's inner workings, explosives, and computer hacking skills, V is able to blow up the Old Bailey as well as hack into the media networks.<br /><br />As the story progresses, we slowly learn V's motivations for why he is doing what he is doing, while Chief Inspector Finch (Stephen Rea), a respected party member, begins an investigation of his own as to who V is and what his motives are.<br /><br />It is interesting that, in today's world when the term terrorist is synonymous with evil, a movie whose "protagonist" is a terrorist would even be made.  However, one has to keep in mind that one man's terrorist is the freedom fighter of someone else (George Washington was most likely seen as a terrorist in the eyes of the British).  Still, V's tactics are brutal, and he is definitely not a hero.  The question that one must ask is how far one must go in pursuit of libery and justice.<br /><br />While there are a few things from the book that didn't make it into the film and there were a few story changes, the film more or less captures Moore's vision (though in the book, V explicitly states that he sought anarchy, while that isn't quite clear in the film).  The politics of this film may seem offensive to people at the extreme sides of the spectrum, but overall, it should intrigue most people.  And for the less politically-minded, it is also a great action film.  Verdict: go see V!</p></body></html>

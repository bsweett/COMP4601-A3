<meta name="summary" content="Perhaps my favorite movie ever"></head><body><p>This movie works on so many levels it's difficult to know where to start.  The battle scenes get a lot of attention even though they are a relatively  small part of the film.  Yet, they are incredibly powerful.  Graphic yes,  but not excessively so.  Gibson the director shows us uncompromisingly how  ugly and horrifying war is so that we understand the sacrifices and risks  the heroes undertake.  At the same time, we see the heroism that war brings  out in good men and the glory they can achieve.  This may be the only film  I've ever seen that balances the two so perfectly.  Films like Platoon tell  you war is ugly and bad, while many older war movies show war in an almost  reverant light.<p>At its heart, though, this is a movie about a man, not a  war.  William Wallace and others come across as complex, interesting people  that we care about.  Wallace's pursuit of a quiet life as a farmer who  wants to marry his childhood love is no less interesting than his attempt  to free Scotland.  Even the villains are compelling (if unlikable)  characters.  The king of England, Edward &quot;of the long shanks,&quot; is  particularly despicable yet the viewer can still relate to his struggle to  make his son something more than a useless fop.  This type of depth ensures  that the people in this movie seem exceptionally real and vivid.<p>Despite  its length this movie doesn't feel long in any way.  It engages you almost  instantly and unfolds beautifully at a pace that varies but never drags.  The acting, script, direction, cinematography, and soundtrack all combine  seamlessly to provide a true masterpiece.</p></body></html>

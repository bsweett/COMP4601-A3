<meta name="summary" content="Lackluster Terminator outing"></head><body><p>Two very different movies are happening at the same time in Terminator Salvation, one of which is much more interesting than the other.  Usually when this happens it means that a producer liked a previous draft well enough to keep its elements, but a later writing team couldn't integrate them well enough into the script as a whole for them to make sense.  The first movie stars Sam Worthington and Moon Bloodgood, as well as Yelchin, and is the more interesting of the two.  The characters are more fleshed out than in the other film, and through Marcus Wright we see an aspect of Skynet that we haven't before.  The second movie stars Christian Bale, and is not nearly as interesting.  In many ways, John Connor is essentially along for the ride.  I don't understand this, given that John Connor is supposed to be the leader of the resistance, and a charismatic leader; you'd think he'd be the focus of the movie.  Bale's Connor is bland and unapproachable, through no fault of Bale; the script gives him very little to work with.<br /><br />On the bright side, there isn't much here that's going to tick you off if you're a fan of the Terminator movies, unlike certain aspects of T3 that made me want to chuck a shoe at my TV.  On the down side, after it's over, my reaction was "huh, so that was it," instead of, "that was really cool."  When a movie with killer robots, time travel, Helena Bonham Carter, a nuclear war, and some Road Warrior cars elicits that kind of response, it has failed in its mission.<br /><br />This is fine as a rental, but I wouldn't add this to my permanent collection.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="the 1st one was better"></head><body><p>thats right!i said it!sure the real estate scam thing on the old one was corny but its better than a long,drawn out plot that only really gets cool right at the end.if they couldnt come up with a cool plot than they shouldve re-christened tim burtons  throw away project where he fights doomsday.all im saying is it didnt really fit into any one catagory too well because it lacked in so many areas.i mean ,ffs,dont pay actual money to watch it.i liked it least of any super hero movies ever made including  elektra,tv movies and all the bat-mans.i mean unless youre in live with superman,just skip it.</p></body></html>

The film was planned according the classic patterns of a symphony of just three movements. The First one is the warmth Adagio where the viewer realizes the rituals and customs of a pacific tribe, and a casual encounter with a foreign tribe, the second movement has to do with the violent scenes of fight and defeat of the pacific tribe, whose leader: "Jaguar paw" will undertake the epic challenge to survive along the dynamic final movement And through the first two movements everything is OK, but the febrile human chase along the last third of movie is what it deserves the jewel of the crown. Shocking sequences and chilling fact will happen that will hold fixed to your seat. Gibson recreates the hero's journey with absolute realism with some commercial concessions here and there, that don't avoid the spectacular dynamic of the movie.<br /><br />Go for this one!</p></body></html>

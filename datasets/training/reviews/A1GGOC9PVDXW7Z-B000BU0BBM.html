Gilliam's small but impressive directing resum&eacute; includes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005O3VC">MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL</a> (UK-1975), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000844JJ">TIME BANDITS</a> (1981), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783225903">BRAZIL</a> (UK-1985), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043X1FM2">THE FISHER KING</a> (1991) and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783229526">FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS</a> (1998).<br /><br />Visually cluttered and awash with CGI cr?p and mud, THE BROTHERS GRIMM challenges credulity at every turn, even as it distorts the 19th Century timeline. Set in 1811, characters hum "Brahms Lullabye" when not listening to Rossini's "La Gazza Ladra." Feh!<br /><br />I shoulda known better than to hope for a semi-biopic about these guys. In an ultra-busy fairy tale about fairy tale creators, Jacob and Wlhelm Grimm are depicted as a pair of traveling ripoff artists. The reality is quite different.<br /><br />They came from a family of nine kids and had an idyllic childhood. Both were academics; together they compiled a German dictionary. The fairy tales the Grimms are renowned for were written as a result of their main interest, the study of linguistics.<br /><br />In 1808, Jacob was named court librarian to the King of Westphalia. Their first volume of legends was compiled two years later; some of these got published in 1812. Eventually the Grimms amassed and published over 200 such fables.<br /><br />These facts wouldn't make for a good movie, though... or would they?<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(5.9) The Brothers Grimm (UK/Czech/USA-2005) - Matt Damon/Heath Ledger/Monica Bellucci/Jonathan Pryce</p></body></html>

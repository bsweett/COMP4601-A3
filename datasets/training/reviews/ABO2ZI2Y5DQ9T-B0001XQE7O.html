<meta name="summary" content="&quot;Life Of My Father&quot; as Burton Tells: Full of Great Visuals"></head><body><p>Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor shine as Edward Bloom, who repeats his preposterous stories thousand times before his son Will -- stories about a giant living in a cave, a witch whose eyeball reflects how the watcher dies, and of course, the big fish.  Now old Edward does it again, before Will's wedding guests and Will himself, who begins to find his daddy too annoying these days.  <p>But the day comes when Will realizes that Edward is not all lying -- actually, the stories he told were all based on truth.  On the deathbed of Edward, he recounts the days of his youth, the romance with his wife, and a little secret about the town of &quot;Spectre.&quot;  <p>The strength of &quot;Big Fish&quot; is its visual flair, and the director is Tim Burton.  The picture is filled with his imagination, which is greatly helped by the able cast including, besides McGregor and Finney, Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi, Alison Lohman as Edward's love Sandra, and Danny Devito.  Jessica Lange plays older Sandra while Will by Billy Crudup.<p>Again I say the visual is great because the stories Edward tells us tend to be repetitive, and its contents are not always interesting, or 'big' enough.  Some episodes are not necessary while some look mercilessly shortened, especially the one about the girl 'Jenny' who is incredibly cute.  Burton keeps on his tales, and they mostly work, but he needs more careful selection and less running time to produce the same effect.<p>Still, the film is moving when it concentrate on its theme -- the relations between the characters, the father and the son in particular.  I don't buy the idea of casting McGregor as Edward from Alabama, but as his resembrance with Finney would justify it.  Well, but Burton's best remains the one about another Edward, which is of course, &quot;Edward Scissorhands.&quot;</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A political spy thriller favorite"></head><body><p>Val Kilmer is perfect for the military role he plays in Spartan; focused, contained, unwaivering, with cold-blooded ruthlessness.  His cool-headed character dances in perfect unison with the intricate planning and choreographed coordination "the Unit" demands, setting aside all personal concerns.  There is no wasted communication or speculation between the characters, just focused repetition to find the answer required to progress to the next step in the mission.<br /><br />The plot unfolds at a measured place, easily pulling the viewer along into the minefield of twists and turns.  Why this movie did not get better play and promotion in 2004 is a bit of a mystery but don't let that stop you from enjoying a first rate thriller, especially at the current Amazon price.  My only criticism of the movie is a plot and character gap concerning the kidnapped girl.  Her actions before and during the night of the abduction are implied but leave a lot room for further development.</p></body></html>

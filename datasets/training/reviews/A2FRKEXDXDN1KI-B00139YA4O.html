<meta name="summary" content="Blu-ray: Absolutely gorgeous on Blu-ray, awesome sound quality and another season of "LOST", so worth owning on Blu-ray!"></head><body><p>"LOST" the series that took America by storm in 2004 and has since been a fan favorite today.<br /><br />In 2004, the series was hyped as the latest series from J.J. Abrams who was known for his TV series "Felicity" and "Alias"  and joined by a talented team which includes executive producer and writer Damon Lindelof ("Crossing Jordan"), executive producer and writer Carlton Cuse ("Nash Bridges", "The Adventures of Brisco County Jr.") , writer Jeffrey Lieber, producer Ra'uf Glasgow ("The Big Easy" and "Profiler"), Jack Bender ("Eight is Enough" and "Beverly Hills 90210'), Bryan Burke ("Alias") and Jean Higgins ("CSI: Miami") .<br /><br />The series debuted on ABC in Sept. 2004 and was instantly a critically acclaimed hit as people all over the Internet would discuss and debate the circumstances of the show.  Series creators would plant Easter Eggs on the TV series, on the Internet, on commercial trailers and eventually people were drawn in by the well-written dramatic thriller and sci-fi storyline, wonderful acting but the overall signs of conspiracy and mystery.  The series would inspire many blogs, podcasts and so much hype that around 17-20 million people were drawn to the series each night a new episode aired.<br /><br />The series won an Emmy Award for "Outstanding Drama Series" and series creator J.J. Abrams was award an Emmy in September 2005.  The series also won the Writers Guild of America Awards for "Outstanding Achievement in Writing for a Dramatic Television Series", 2005 Producer Guild Awards for "Best Production" and the 2005 Director's Guild Award for "Best Direction of a Dramatic Television Program" and the "Screen Actors Guild Awards 2005' for Best Ensemble Cast.<br /><br />For the first season, a total of 25 episodes aired from Sept. 2004 through May 2005.

"SeasonPlay" is optional and people can select it before watching an episode.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />"LOST"  is a series that looks incredible on High Definition.  Featured in 1080p High Definition (aspect ratio of 1:78:1), the detail of the island is captured quite vibrantly.  The green lush plants that surround the island, the blue skies, the blue ocean.  Personally, most of the video footage shot in Hawaii tend to be vibrant in colors and "LOST" is no exception.  There is grain that can be seen in each episode and I have to admit that the quality is not up to par as "LOST - THE COMPLETE FOURTH SEASON" (not sure if they are using better equipment in the later seasons) but the picture quality is still pretty good.<br /><br />There is little compression artifacts that can be seen in low light conditions but overall, the picture quality of "LOST" is not perfect but still looks gorgeous!  I compared both my DVD box set to this Blu-ray set and the picture quality in High Definition shows off detail that I never caught on DVD.  From the plane wreckage to the orange dimples on the orange peel in John Locke's mouth.  These can be seen quite clearly on Blu-ray.<br /><br />As for the audio, "LOST" is featured in DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1.  The dialogue is quite clear but one thing that caught my attention is how magnificent the audio is in terms of capturing the ambiance of the island when each person is moving through the jungle.  The explosions of the plane is caught all around you and you are literally immersed into the destruction of the plane as audio is heard on the front channels, surrounds, rear surrounds and through the LFE of your subwoofer.  Very nice!<br /><br />Also, I loved how music and sounds really brought an overall mood to certain scenes. The music by Michael Giacchino and the way the orchestra creates that tension for the scenes was awesome.  So, music plays a big part in the series and the music soundtrack is just wonderful!<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />The Blu-ray edition of "LOST - THE COMPLETE SEASON ONE" is featured in Standard Definition (480i) and English 5.1 Dolby Digital with English SDH, French and Spanish subtitles.

I was on the main forums every week, downloaded every "LOST" podcast available, read the magazines and just pretty much got drawn in by the story but the various theories that people had about the island, the characters and more. In fact, I have owned the first season on DVD, listened to the audio books and even owned the pilot on UMD.  That's how hooked I was to this show.<br /><br />Personally, I just found that mystique of crash landing in an island and having to survive to be quite exciting but even moreso, finding out that there are some weird things going on in the island that makes you wonder if what we were watching is actually happening or are the people actually dead.  There were so many unusual things that have happened and "LOST" was what was needed on network TV.<br /><br />Also, as much as "LOST" would seem like a wreck with so many characters featured, the way the show is presented through various flashbacks of each of the main characters, the writers really focused on character development and making the viewer feel positive (or negative) about a certain character and learn about their behavior and a past that somehow each character has some kind of connection with each other.<br /><br />There were so many amazing episodes, one such episode that will always be a favorite was the first death of one of the main 14.  What a shocker! What was equally amazing was watching the season finale and I can remember being shocked and having to go back and forth on my DVR and then later on my DVD copies to see these "secrets" that fans have caught in the final episode.  Nevertheless, that finale was awesome and left myself and many fans highly anticipating the second season.<br /><br />The first season of course leaves the viewer with plenty of questions (and we're currently awaiting season 6 and many questions still exist today) but it was those questions that help fuel the fire to various theories that many fans could not help but take part of.  It was quite fun to see how this series captured the attention of so many people and how the producers, writers and even the talent were so surprised of the various theories themselves.<br /><br />I have to say that watching the first season of "LOST" on High Definition five years later is quite amazing.  The series is absolutely beautiful on Blu-ray and  was also impressed by the DTS-HD Master Audio lossless soundtrack.  And it was great to see all the special features on the DVD included (although I wonder if all Easter Eggs are also included on the Blu-ray since I've only found a very few so far).<br /><br />Fans who enjoy the "LOST" series will truly want to own the series on High Definition.  If you are a big fan of the show, it is pretty much a no-brainer to pick up both Season 1 and 2 (as well as the previously released Season 3 and 4) on Blu-ray.  This season is what started it all and with the final sixth season coming soon, you can't help but be happy that all four seasons are now available on Blu-ray.<br /><br />"LOST - THE COMPLETE FIRST SEASON" on Blu-ray is highly recommended!</p></body></html>

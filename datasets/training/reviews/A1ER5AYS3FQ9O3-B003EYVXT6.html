<meta name="summary" content="Can't remember the last time I've rated a movie so poorly"></head><body><p>My spouse and I watched this one the other night and then immediately regretted it. We only kept viewing it till the end to make sure that it had so few redeeming qualities. We had high hopes that we'd be seeing something akin to Aliens or just a fairly original and suspenseful sci-fi flick. It would have been okay if it had just been mildly entertaining. Instead we viewed what seemed to be a nearly incoherent movie - and actually it was incoherent in parts - as well as at least one character who disappeared at the last moment, with no explanation.<br /><br />The sex scenes? My spouse and I both felt disgusted by those and we aren't uptight about sex scenes in movies. These were just pitiful, violent and made no sense. Were they just thrown in there in hopes of attracting some extra suspense or attention? If so, the attention was the wrong kind. I felt sorry for the actors in this film. Now watch...this will go on to be one of those movies which is so bad it becomes camp. I pray that doesn't happen. It doesn't deserve even that honor.<br /><br />I'd really like to read the script for this one. It is hard to believe that anyone signed up for this film in its final version. Perhaps they changed the script as the movie was being shot. If you are looking for entertainment, suspense, decent characters, and a sci-fi thriller, look elsewhere. If you are trying to watch a film to help you go to sleep, this might be a good choice. Barely watchable.</p></body></html>

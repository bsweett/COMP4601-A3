I cannot stand the arguments of any extremist political or social groups, leftist or  ultra-conservative. But we're here to give an opinion about a movie and not  to have a philosophical meeting about morals. So, in my humble opinion,  AMERICAN HISTORY X is a very poor movie with a great subject and  outstanding actors.<p>The script of AMERICAN HISTORY X is a collection of  clich&eacute;s one can find in thousands of Hollywood movies since the thirties.  Just imagine, in the character played by Edward -DEREK- Norton, James  Cagney or Humphrey Bogart. After having spent three years in jail, Bogie  comes back home and realizes his younger brother has become a potential  public danger. With the help of his parole officer, he'll try to save him  from the streets. Or imagine Gary Cooper, a former hitman, coming back home  only to discover that his son, let's say - Montgomery Clift -, is the  fastest gunman of the town. Will he be able to convince Monty that duels  are a no-future occupation ?<p>Good subjects don't necessarily make good  movies specially if there's only a yes man to direct. So, if you want to  study the evolution of the right-wing neo-nazis groups in today America, it  would be a good idea to see a few documentaries on the subject, and there  are pretty good ones to be seen, rather than to buy AMERICAN HISTORY X.<p>A  pretentious DVD.</p></body></html>

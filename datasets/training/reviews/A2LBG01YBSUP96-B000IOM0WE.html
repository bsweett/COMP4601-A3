BIG WHOOP!!!!!! take a pen and paper with you while walking down any street and make a check mark when you pass by a woman as pretty and youll need more paper.theron has NO CURVES! same with j-lo on talent.90% of famous people are given hotty props only because they are famous.then you have the other side of the spectrum like halle barry.she truly is beautiful but she shouldnt be acting.anyway,this movie does indeed flux the big one.she dodges bullets and soldiers with boring karate kicks and flips while never getting her hair messed up.brilliant!hollywood fails YET AGAIN to take a tv show and turn it into something its not,a movie!in closing,lonely males should find this 5 star material.</p></body></html>

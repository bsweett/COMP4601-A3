<meta name="summary" content="A dull, cliched, highly unoriginal thriller saved by Pollack and the cast"></head><body><p>"The Interpreter" has an interesting story: an interpreter for the United Nations, played by Nicole Kidman, overhears an assassination plot spoken in a language she and very few other people understand.  Sean Penn plays the U.S. Secret Service agent assigned to investigate the interpreter and see if she did hear what she says she did.<br /><br />"The Interpreter" is Sydney Pollack's first film since 1999's flop "Random Hearts".  Pollack's directing is one of the two high points of the film.  The other is the cast.  Kidman and Penn are both very good and, paired with Pollack's directing, they keep the film going.<br /><br />Other than those points mentioned above, the film has little going for it.  About fifty minutes through the film I was sick of it.  There's very little originality in the film; it's cliched and predictable.  I felt like I was watching another dumb thriller.<br /><br />I don't have much to say about this film.  I thought it was a dull, cliched thriller, simple as that.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Train, Train Go Away . . .  ( * * 1/2 )"></head><body><p>There was a 1986 film called RUNAWAY TRAIN with Jon Voight. There was the exciting 1974 version of THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE TWO THREE with Walter Matthau and Robert Shaw. There was the not-too-exciting 2009 version of THE TAKING OF PELHAM 1 2 3 with Denzel Washington. Everybody I knew who had seen the original was convinced it was going to suck, and it did. Nevertheless, Tony Scott liked his own work in PELHAM 1 2 3 so much that he immediately rehashed it with UNSTOPPABLE, another Denzel Washington movie. Denzel, who used to do Oscar-caliber work such as PHILADELPHIA and MALCOLM X, is definitely on the downside of the hill and is in danger of being typecast as Choo-Choo Charlie. In PELHAM 1 2 3, he played the emotionally conflicted subway dispatcher. Here, he plays an emotionally conflicted locomotive engineer.<br /><br />UNSTOPPABLE is the story of a freight train loaded with hazmat cars that somehow gets away from the railmen and, engineerless, goes careening through rural Pennsylvania toward a large city. If the train derails in said large city, it will be the American Chernobyl. While this disaster is hanging over their heads, three quarters of everybody in Pennsylvania is standing around near the tracks watching and waiting for the train to derail. In real life, the mass evacuation spoken of in the film would have been a panic-stricken mass evacuation, not an excuse for a Statewide block party. Denzel is the engineer of the lone locomotive that is chasing the runaway train in order to hook up and possibly bring the thing to a halt safely. Unfortunately, UNSTOPPABLE never really gets moving; despite the suspenseful premise, the film lacks any real suspense since it is so full of cliches and set-piece action that we know how the film is going to end just as soon as it starts.<br /><br />There are no surprises in UNSTOPPABLE. We've seen it all before, and although it's worth a watch, it's not really as "unstoppable" as it is "totally forgettable."</p></body></html>

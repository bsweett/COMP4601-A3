I know I will take some heat for this but it just didn't come across as any thing spectacular. We couldn't wait to see this movie from all the great reviews that it received. I couldn't find a single reason this movie was any better than average. When those rats started flowing in and around the food storage.....yuck! No, the book was wrong, not just anybody can learn to cook!</p></body></html>

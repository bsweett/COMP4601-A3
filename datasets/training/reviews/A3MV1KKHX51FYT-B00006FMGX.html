Which of the three is "Frank William Abagnale", the most daring confidence man under nineteen? He was caught in 1969 France and extradited to America. In 1963 his father Frank Sr. spoke at a Rotary dinner about his life. Later he got a loan from a bank but the family moved to an apartment. [Note the locks on the door.] Frank Jr. goes to a new high school, and impersonates the teacher of a French class! There is a surprise visitor at home, but Frank won't tell. His grandmother comes for a visit, his parents are divorcing. "Everything will be ok." "Is it ok if I write you a check?" Frank uses forged identification to pass a bad check (and failing). He studied the actions of airline pilots and learned their jargon. Next he orders a uniform. [Note the period automobiles on the street.] Frank has no problems in cashing checks or paying by check now. He forges another check.<br /><br />By knowing the jargon the "Skywayman" gets a free airplane ride as a deadhead. Frank learns the technical details of bank checking. He bought a used checkwriter machine to create authenticity. The MICR routing is in the numbers, a check from across the country won't be bounced for two weeks. Now the FBI is looking for him. His father has troubles with the IRS. An FBI team follows the forged checks to a motel; he is still there! There is a surprising meeting in the motel room. [There is unconscious humor here.] FBI agent Carl Hanratty has seen his face and can identify him. Later he buys new suits and meets a former model. "How much would you pay?" Frank has another check handy. On Christmas he makes a personal call to Carl Hanratty. "You're gonna get caught." A young waiter gives Carl a clue from a comic book - "he's a kid", his prints aren't in the system! They make a list of runaways and start a search. Frank's mother has a yearbook with his picture in it. "$1.3 million."<br /><br />Frank is living in an apartment in Atlanta. He goes to a hospital and meets a nurse. [Kindness can work with strangers.] "You have really nice teeth." "I'm a doctor." Frank's new forged identity is a graduate of Harvard Medical School. Frank Connors was at the top of his class. He watches TV movies about medical practice. But he has to answer an emergency call for a bloody accident. In NY Hanratty visits Frank Sr. and read the return address on a letter. [What, no mail cover?] Brenda tells about her past. Frank can help her, he meets her parents. "That was beautiful." [He can tell good stories.] "The dog was dead." Brenda's father wants the truth." [Can a trial lawyer detect when a witness is lying?] Frank tells him the truth: he is nothing, really. How did he pass the bar exam in Louisiana?<br /><br />Frank is now an Assistant Prosecutor. But this time he gets his knowledge from a "Perry Mason" episode and makes a mistake. ["The Case of the Jealous Journalist" was first shown on Sept. 2, 1961.] Frank visits his father and learns the news about his mother. He makes another call to Hanratty. "Stop chasing me." "It's my job." Hanratty knows "he can't change his name now". Men in dark suits crash the engagement party. Frank tells Brenda about his other names and identities. "Why would you lie to me?" Frank slips out by a window. At the airport Frank observes the watchers. Next he visits a college to impersonate an airline recruiter; it's a plan to escape surveillance! Frank flies to Europe and forges better checks with older equipment.<br /><br />But Hanratty surmises Frank is in France and living in his mother's village. "That was really good, Carl." Can Frank escape from an airplane in the air? Not for long. Frank got twelve years, to be served in isolation. "Merry Christmas, Frank." Afterwards Frank offers advice to Hanratty on detecting forged checks. He is offered a job to help them. There is a final scene in the airport. "Nobody is chasing you." "How did he do it?"<br />The words at the end said Frank helped the FBI capture some of the world's most elusive check forgers and counterfeiters, and is considered a foremost authority on bank fraud and forgery. Frank also redesigned many of the secure checks used by today's banks. [Did the trauma of his parents' divorce force him to take the wrong path?]</p></body></html>

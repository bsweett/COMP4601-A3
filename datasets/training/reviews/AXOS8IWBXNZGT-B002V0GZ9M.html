This time it's a romance with a time travel-ish twist: the couple fall in love through correspondence only, and they then realize that they are offset from each other in time by two years. It's the first film in a little while that's made me want to read Jane Austen: Persuasion, in this case. Both characters carry the film well, and they continue to have great chemistry together. The storyline could have fumbled under the weight of its Macguffin, but didn't. Of course, I have a weakness for time-travel type stories, but this film was definitely enjoyable.</p></body></html>

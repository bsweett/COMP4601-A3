<meta name="summary" content="Jumps from 96th ranked on AFI list to 12th, thanks in part to great transfers like this HD dvd"></head><body><p>I watched this 1956 John Ford classic for the first time the night after watching the 10th aniversary of afi's 100 years 100 greatest movies show.<br />I have a runco front projector and a 106" drop down screen even an image stretched that much it looked amazing on Hd, so bright and colorful.<br />Ive seen older movies in HD via cable and through dish (voom when it was around) and they do not compare to a movie on hd dvd, i own about 30 Hd dvd titles so far and believe it or not this would rank as one of the best looking ones.<br />I believe older titles and silent films restored like this in amazing transfers and becoming available on dvd, hd dvd and blu ray are big reasons that there were 19 new slots on the afi list that did not make it last time and only three movies kept there original rankings.  Another example a beautiful movie like city lights jumps from 76 to 11 and Vertigo  from 61 to 9.<br />What can i say about a movie like this that hasn't already been said, i've read reviews from Ebert and interviews with Scorsese and found it interesting that Taxi driver was influenced a great deal by the Searchers.<br />Ethan pursues his niece Debbie, obsessed and determined to save her from the commanche indians.  In Taxi driver Travis Bickle also tries to save a young Jody Foster about the same age as Debbie from a pimp.  It is not certain either girl wants to be saved in both films, and the pimp in Scorsese's film played by Harvey Keitel wears an indian feather in his hat.<br />This is a great add to any collection and a great looking and sounding dvd for any time period.</p></body></html>

Up until the Olive's big number, there wasn't really anything in this film that I haven't seen before.  I mean, the audience knows that book deal isn't going to go through the first time Richard utter the words.  Other than the first five minutes, Uncle Frank doesn't seem suicidial at all.  Can't pick apart Dewayne since he doesn't even talk until the third act.  And I find it highly unlikely that a family would pick up everything and rush to enter this thing WITHOUT seeing the girl's routine.  Everyone knows that Grandpa's whacked, what qualified him to be coaching their daughter for a pageant?<br />BUT what saves this movie is the acting talent.  Good performance CAN save a mediocre skript.  And Ms. Abigail is absolutely precious in this film.  I'm happy that she looked like what a seven year old should look like and not those life-size barbie dolls that are the norm for young beauty pageants that in this reviewer's opinion should be deemed criminal.  The only thing is: for this to have been Olive's dream to win, she didn't seem all that crushed when she didn't.</p></body></html>

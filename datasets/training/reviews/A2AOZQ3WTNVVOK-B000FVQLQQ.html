<meta name="summary" content="A Beautiful Movie"></head><body><p>It's easy to be critical of the portrayal of schizophrenia if you understand it well, or if you are schizophrenic yourself.  However, I know little about the subject.  Further, I know very little about John Nash's life.  Therefore, any criticism related to either I must ignore because of the beauty of the movie and the triumph of the character.<p>John Nash is one of those very rare people on spaceship earth:  a true genius.  The movie does a pretty decent job at providing examples of his genius.  There's no need to dwell on the subject, because it's pretty evident from his mannerisms that this guy is in a place that you and I will never truly understand.<p>Russell Crowe is more than good in the role of John Nash, he is truly outstanding.  As I compare his performance in &quot;Gladiator&quot; to his performance in this movie, which stretches his abilities significantly in areas that &quot;Gladiator&quot; merely explored, I have come to realize that Russell Crowe is a one of the great actors of our time.  Perhaps schizophrenia is not as seamless as portrayed in the movie, but with 120 minutes to work with, I was thoroughly convinced.<p>I was also very absorbed by the choice that Nash made.  He could either keep taking the medication, or choose to fight his problem and regain his mathematical abilities, and some control over his life.  He chose the second.  To make such a choice reminded me of Charlie in a similarly poignant story, &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot; by Daniel Keyes, which was the basis for the movie &quot;Charley&quot; with Cliff Robertson.  Only in that story Charlie had no choice he could make other than to fight.  In a way, Nash fought and never truly won, but was able to overcome his difficulties well enough to be functional.<p>Jennifer Connelly, who I enjoyed in &quot;Labyrinth&quot;, &quot;The Rocketeer&quot; and &quot;Dark City&quot;, among others, is all grown up and performs at the same level as Russell Crowe, well deserving of an Oscar.  Jennifer too deserves the appellation of &quot;great&quot;.  She will definitely be in high demand in the future.  By the way, she is prettier than she has ever been.<p>This edition of the movie features 2 discs with all kinds of extras.  I don't quite understand why the full screen edition costs more than the wide screen edition (which is what I purchased), but either is worth the price.  I won't bother to give you all the extras you get, but there is a lot.<p>I found that at the end of the movie I got a bit teary-eyed, and my wife did not.  After discussing the movie with several other people, I found that for some reason this movie tends to be more emotional for men than women.  I was unable to find a good reason for this, but I find the phenomenon interesting, since usually it is the other way around.  My point is that if you found the ending moving and left you with a really good feeling, then you probably understood the movie and this is clearly a movie you should own.  If you sat there and said to yourself, &quot;What in the heck was that all about?&quot;, then this isn't the movie for you.</p></body></html>

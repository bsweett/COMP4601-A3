Everything they teach you not to do in a screenplay, you did blatantly.<br /><br />This is by far the worst of your movies.  I mean, this movie could have easily been done by some rookie filmmaker.<br /><br />I felt none of the suspense, none of the intensity, no sense of curiosity.  I couldn't even feel the tension between Deschanel and Wahlberg's character.  This was a dead, flat movie.  It was just there.  Nothing was "happening".<br /><br />What was with all the wide shots on the people killing themselves?  No close-ups?  At least make some sharp cuts to add intensity.  There was none of that.<br /><br />This whole movie smelled like monotony.  The theme music had that same dreary, moaning oboe theme to it. Even the freaking synopsis on the back cover was bland. Nothing rambunctious like "Edge of your seat thriller".<br /><br />Wahlberg and Deschanel did a horrible job.  Leguziamo did his best to salvage whatever he could of a scene.  Not their fault.  I've seen them all do much better.  Bad script.  Bad direction.<br /><br />Trees and plants as silent killers?  Okay, maybe you didn't want vines and limbs to be grabbing at people because that would have been cliche, but at least make the trees imposing enough to want to cause people to kill themselves.  Add some foreboding lighting or a weird glow.  Trees and Plants are more eco-friendly than eco-foe.  I wasn't convinced at all.  Sad.<br /><br />Shams, you're slipping.  What happened to all the movies with the surprise endings?  You strayed from your trademark.  That's what you're known far.  That's what we come to see.  We liked it when you surprised us. We understand that you don't have to do every movie that way, but  you seemed bored making this film.  Are you sure you're head is in the game?<br /><br />I'm assuming that you're just in a slump right now, but let's your next film comes back to the standard.  We miss that.</p></body></html>

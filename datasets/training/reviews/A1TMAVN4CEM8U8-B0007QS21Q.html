<meta name="summary" content="A Fun Movie, A Better Book"></head><body><p>I, Robot  (DVD)<br /><br />I, Robot is supposedly based upon the book<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B7647K">I, ROBOT</a> by Isaac Asimov,(The Good Doctor).  I've read the book and IMHO  they have very little in common.  They both have robots in them and that's about it.<br />I did enjoy the movie, however.  I just wish the screenplay had been closer to the book.  I doubt that the Good Doctor would have approved, but he's dead now so he doesn't get a vote.<br /><br />I still recommend the movie ,but be sure to read the book.<br /><br />Gunner  August, 2007</p></body></html>

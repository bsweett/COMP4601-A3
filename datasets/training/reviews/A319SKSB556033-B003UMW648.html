<meta name="summary" content="One of the most boring films I have seen in my life"></head><body><p>I haven't read the books, so I'm not prejudiced in any way. But as someone who actually enjoyed the first one I was startled by how shockingly dull this snoozefest sequel is.<br /><br />I can sit here and spend an hour writing a review that tears the film apart bit by bit though, quite frankly, I have better things to do with my time so I will only focus on my biggest complaints.<br /><br />Yes, I know it's a film for kids and that it's rated PG but where is the blood? Hundreds of people, humans and creatures alike, are felled in battle but there is not one drop of blood in the whole movie. What is this teaching our children about violence exactly? Don't give me any nonsense about traumatizing them either. I saw <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012GVKW8">Predator [Blu-ray</a>] when I was a kid and I turned out fine. But this is Disney after all and the only people keeping them afloat as a studio are overprotective mothers who fear absolutely everything and are only too happy to spend money on movies and products that falsely suggest that the world is a magical and safe place (this is what you call being 'Disneyfied') and consider something as tame and boring as Prince Caspian to be dark and tough. "You may find Narnia a more savage place than you remember," warns Aslan. Wow, does that mean that we'll be getting Rambo-level violence? Sadly, no. However, more people are killed in this film. Can you work that out? Because I can't.<br /><br />Since I haven't read the book I wasn't previously orientated as to who's who and what their motivations are, and the film doesn't make it any clearer I promise you. Far, far too often I found myself asking 'Who is he?', 'Who are they?', 'Why are all the bad guys identical to each other?', 'Why are they the bad guys again?'. 'What do they want?'. 'Why are they all Spanish?', 'Why are the kids still kids? Shouldn't they return to Narnia as adults?' And so on...and so on...<br /><br />The only thing this film is good for is a cure for insomnia. I know that's a childish and crass and far from being a clever soundbite but it was so catatonic that it simply is not inspiring an intelligent review out of me.<br /><br />Whatever charm <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YAFJXE">The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe [Blu-ray</a>] had is well and truly gone, all that's left is some pretty scenery and that's not enough to keep me interested for well over two hours. Please Disney, don't even bother making the rest of them.</p></body></html>

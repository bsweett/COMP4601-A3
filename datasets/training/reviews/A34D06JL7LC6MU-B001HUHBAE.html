<meta name="summary" content="One of the Best Films of 2007"></head><body><p>While "Zodiac" treads familar territory, with themes that existed in films like "Summer of Sam" and "The Black Dahlia," it succeeds and becomes a much better film than those two for it's sheer filmmaking brilliance. David Fincher is a great director, who's directed audience favorites "Se7en" and "Fight Club" but "Zodiac" is his finest achievement as a director. I had the same first impression with the film that many people had. How can somebody make a compelling film about a case that was never solved? Fincher makes it look easy. This is probably the 2nd best film of 2007 (behind "Black Snake Moan") and is worthy of Oscar nominations. The film is based on a book by Robert Graysmith, a former cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle, who is the main character of the film and is played by Jake Gyllenhaal. Graysmith's book has been blasted for just how accurate it is, but if the fact's are close to what we see in the film...Then this is a very haunting story. The films opens with a young couple being gunned down on the 4th of July and then switches to The San Francisco Chronicle building, where the editor receives a letter from a person claiming to be the killer. Pretty soon, reporter Paul Avery (Robert Downey Jr.) begins writing articles about the killer (who dubs him the Zodiac), while Graysmith grows more-and-more interested in the case. Meanwhile, David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) investigates the case while obsession slowly grips him. Now, I compared this film to "Summer of Sam" and "The Black Dahlia." I want to add that this film is massively superior to both, but I make the comparion because "Summer of Sam" is about an actual murderer and the way his murders affected the people living in the same place. "The Black Dahlia" is about an unsolved murder and deals with the way obsession grips the main characters trying to solve the case. "Zodiac" would work as a ficitional film, because of how compelling it is. In one scene where Graysmith meets up with a man who he slowly grows to believe may be the Zodiac was one of the most suspenseful scenes I've seen on film recently. As for John Caroll Lynch, who plays the most likely Zodiac suspect (although he was cleared due to handwriting and fingerprint evidence) plays the character perfectly. His final scene in the film is very haunting. The final scene itself is one of the most haunting in the film. Gyllenhaal is terrific as Graysmith, the adult Boy Scout; But it's Downey Jr. that steals the show! It's too bad this film was released so early in the year, because Downey Jr. deserves an Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actor. Avery delivers some of the best one-liners and there's a lot of subtle touches that go hand-in-hand with the character that just make him so great. I'm curious how accurate and factually correct this film is, but that doesn't matter. It's a film that uses a lot of restraint in the blood-and-gore department and is almost Hitchcockian in the way it handles suspense and terror. I loved this movie, it was everything a person could desire from a film. Even with a 2 hour and 40 minute running time, it's always compelling, interesting, and entertaining.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></body></html>

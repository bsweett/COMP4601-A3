<meta name="summary" content="It's a Cult Film: Not Scary, Too Many References"></head><body><p>Directed by Rob Zombie (of course, not real name of Robert Cummings), 'House of 1000 Corpses" became an instant cult, like 'Rocky Horror Show.'  See this one as such ... kind of a film that is full of campy, very campy fun.<br /><br />The plot is, as you know, similar to 'Texas Chainsaw Massaccre.'  The four hapless (and stupid, you say) students driving a car at a deserted courtryside find themselves trapped in the wrong place, like, the house where killers dwell.  This is no secret from the beginning.<br /><br />Interesting part is its cast: you see Sid Haig with painted face like clown, who organizes a 'murder ride' at his own house, but that's just a beginning.  You see Bill Morsley (yes, that's him in 'Texas Chainsaw 2'!), Irwin Keyes, Michael J Pollard, and oh! no! that's Karen Black too!  Hey, you might not remember this, but she is an Oscar nominee!  Plus, many, many dead bodies, some of them making us very sick.<br /><br />Still, the film is not scary.  That doesn't mean it has no merit for us to watch.  But the fact that it has borrowed the central plot from 'Texas Chainsaw Massaccre' is so obviously felt, and the film is shot with too much MTV-style visuals, and I found the film dazzling (and intriguing) at first, then boring, especially the latter half.<br /><br />I'm sorry if I offend you, but ... is it worth our wait?  I know some people loved the film, making this film a surprise hit.  I know Rob Zombie loves horror films, and made a lot of references to the genre (and the title is a 1974 film 'The House of Seven Corpses.'  Sid Haig and other actors are funny to see ... sort of, and as far as we see its opening, Rob has a talent to make a good film.  But I need something more, something besides what makes this film a cult film.</p></body></html>

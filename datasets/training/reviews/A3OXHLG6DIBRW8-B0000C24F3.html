<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding Alien Movie Collection - Highly Recommended"></head><body><p>My son had seen "Alien vs Predator" and didn't know the background of either creature so, realizing that we were remiss in his pop culture education, we bought the Alien Quadrilogy. This is a fantastic 9 DVD set that contains two versions of each movie and more extras than we will ever be able (or inclined) to watch. While not detailed reviews of each movie, here are my general observations:<br /><br />* Alien  - This is a great movie that contains all of the elements of a classic sci-fi\horror. Like several other reviewers, I prefer the original release over the extended version.<br /><br />* Aliens - Really good sequel which stays true to what made the original movie great. This time I liked the extended version better.<br /><br />* Alien 3 - Not nearly as good as the first two, but still watchable. I think the theatrical release is the better one (other reviews disagree), but the extended version is still interesting to watch.<br /><br />* Alien Resurrection - I really disliked this movie all around, it doesn't matter which version, but it still needs to be seen to round out the series.<br /><br />The box cover art is in an attractive holographic like motif that looks very nice on the shelf. The DVDs are kept in a somewhat unwieldy fold out arrangement, but they do take up surprising little room.<br /><br />Overall this a great value for all that is packed into this great set!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH</p></body></html>

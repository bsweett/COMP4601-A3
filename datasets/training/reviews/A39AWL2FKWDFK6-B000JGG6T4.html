He adroitly also weaves an emotional story of human relationships in his tale which succeeds in resurrecting the life of a down and out Denzel Washington.<br /><br />The talented Washington plays Creasey, a former CIA assassin whose guilt ridden existence has caused him to curl up into a bottle of Jack Daniels.  He aimlessly travels to Mexico to visit ex-comrade Christopher Walken, a mover and shaker down there.  Walken recommends Washington for a job as a bodyguard protecting the vivacious 9 year old Dakota Fanning daughter of wealthy businessman Marc Anthony and attractive wife Radha Mitchell.<br /><br />The aloof and alcoholic Washington gets the job but tries to keep his distance from the friendly and charming child.  Gradually Fanning wears down Washington's resistance and they forge a very solid and caring relationship.  The child is ultimately kidnapped in a plot orchestrated by corrupt policemen with Washington getting severely wounded.<br /><br />By this juncture, Washington had given up the bottle and as he recuperates he commences to exact vengeance against the kidnappers.  In a remorseless reign of terror Washington pulls out all stops to find the young girl.<br /><br />This flick is not recommended for the feint of heart and there are some extremely graphic scenes.  Personal fave Giancarlo Giannini of Lina Wertmuller fame makes a welcome appearance in the movie as a local law enforcement official.</p></body></html>

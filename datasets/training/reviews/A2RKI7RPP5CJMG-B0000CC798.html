Unlike most reviewers, I didn't think this film was any better than the first.  I do believe that it is a good film in its own right.  The first sequence, the attack on the White House, is by far the best sequence of the movie.  Nightcrawler was one of my favorite X-men growing up.  I also enjoyed the fact that they included his deep Catholic faith.  The comic actually toyed with this character becoming a priest.<br />Overall, the action sequences in this film were great.  The Deathstryke/Wolverine battle was one of the most violent sequences I've seen in comic-to-screen adaptation.  It was more violent than all of &quot;Daredevil.&quot;  Wolverine came out of his shell in this movie by racking up a huge bodycount.<br />As far as the story goes, it played out very well and very evenly.  It was just as solid as the first flick and if you enjoyed the first one, this one will not let you down.  The pacing of the movie is quite swift, which could cause a non-comic fan to lose track of some of the characters and their abilities.  The ending was left wide open and if you do follow the comic, you know that something special will be rising in the inevitable part three.<p>A good action movie with a solid story and brilliant effects.  Buy it and enjoy it today.</p></body></html>

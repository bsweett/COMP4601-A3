<meta name="summary" content="Better the second time through"></head><body><p>It's amazing how one's perception can change the second time through a movie.  The Matrix Reloaded got better.  Keanu's easy-going acting style is perfect for the role of Neo, and Laurence Fishburne is just plain awesome as Morpheus (even if he did put on a few extra pounds).  This movie has everything you could ask for; a plot you have to think about, great action sequences, one of the best Dolby mixes ever, and Jada Pinkett Smith.  The special features are terrific.<p>I highly recommend this DVD.</p></body></html>

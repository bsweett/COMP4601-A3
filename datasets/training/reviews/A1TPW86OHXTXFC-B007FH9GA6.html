<meta name="summary" content="A More Compelling Lisbeth"></head><body><p>I did not feel as much of a compulsion to see the American version of 'The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo', as I did with the Swedish film. How could this newer version ever compare to the exquisite Swedish version? However, was there ever a more perfect Lisbeth than Rooney Mara, she completely won me over.<br /><br />In the Swedish version, we were given the bleak, white/black doomed version of the Swedish countryside and the personalities of its inhabitants. It seems they were good or evil. In the American film, Rooney Mara brings the isolation and complete vulnerability of Lisbeth. Maybe it was that in this version, Lisbeth's story is told from a different standpoint, it is her version without the complication of Mikael Blomkvist's character. We could feel her distance, emotionally and physically. She is alone, she isolates herself from her sexual partners as well as those who she deals with. Lisbeth does not smile, not does she make much of an expression at any time. Rooney Mara was able to take this character and give us this added dimension. It is not until she starts working with Mikael, who likes her and trusts her, that she will finally reveal some emotion, but it is not complete trust, nor should it be. It is Lisbeth's story that interests us. Mikael Blomkvist is interesting, but it is an added attraction. Daniel Craig did a great job, but he was missing the vulnerability and lack of confidence that I knew Mikael from the novel.<br /><br />This American version was so well done, that it had an edge in my book. What I did miss was the Swedish language and the sub titles, somehow they added to the mystery of these characters. Christopher Plummer was the perfect Henrik Vanger. Of course, Christopher Plummer is perfection in any of his roles. The other characters were well done and did not separate themselves in much fashion. I did not find Robin Wright as convincing as Erika Berger, she did not give off the sexuality that I felt from the Swedish version.<br /><br />This film stands alone as a great film, but it is Rooney Mara who makes this film. She is all of the superlatives, and I felt a deep connection to her character. I hope we see her again in the second and third version of the trilogy.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 03-24-12<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0070Z97LG">Dream House</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006K004FU">Tanner Hall</a></p></body></html>

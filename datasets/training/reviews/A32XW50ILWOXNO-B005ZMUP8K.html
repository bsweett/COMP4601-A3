<meta name="summary" content="Twice the plot, half the fun."></head><body><p>"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" is an aspiring screenwriter's paradise, a dense, twisting, bulky construction that, in terms of sheer scope, is one of the more ambitious action scripts ever written: Here is a picture, written by Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio, that not only fleshes out some of the details from "The Curse of the Black Pearl" but gambles by resurrecting characters who easily could have been left dead. The three films are to be a sincere trilogy: The final plank, "At World's End," will likely better inform "Black Pearl," and vice versa. And the "Dead Man's Chest" is not predictable.<br /><br />But it's comfortable - because it's true - to dismiss "Dead Man's Chest" as a draining, boring experience, so plot-heavy that it tears at the sense of fun established in "Black Pearl." The two big action scenes are nearly identical and steal too much from the "Indiana Jones" series. Johnny Depp, as Captain Jack Sparrow, has vaguer, more passive role that mostly requires him to lurch through the story. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are purposely kept apart. And so on. There are too many crews, too many heavies and too much exposition. "Dead Man's Chest" is an overdose. It is not a film I ever need to see again.<br /><br />A too-deep breath is required to explain all of the gunk trotted out over nearly three hours, so here's the very skinny: Captain Jack, Will (Bloom) and Elizabeth (Knightley) are all more or less after the treasure chest of Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), a half-dead squid man who commands a crew of half sea animals who sold their soul to him. Now, best I can tell, this ship, the "Flying Dutchman," zips about with its giant kraken floating underneath it plundering boats and capturing more souls. Jones wants Jack's soul, Jack wants the chest, Elizabeth, quite oddly, finds herself wanting Jack, Will wants, it seems, to simply get out of this movie, and somewhere behind all this is a Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander) of the East India Trading Company and the now-disgraced Norrington (Jack Davenport) dragged in from the first film.<br /><br />There are pardons, keys, cannibals, those two dummy pirates from "Black Pearl," two or three trips to Tortuga, an elaborate scene featuring Elizabeth's wedding dress, a letter from the king, a voodoo priestess, Jack's loyal crew, a dog, five attacks by the kraken, a giant water wheel, fruit, cages made of human bones, Will's half-dead father, a game of dice, a drunken brawl, two giant pigs and a scene where Jack shoots himself out of a coffin. It just goes on and on.<br /><br />Director Gore Verbinski falls into an easy trap: He takes the franchise too seriously. The music swells in this movie like a constant squall. Action is created in a sheer flurry without much interest in skill or believability. It's created for spectacle, not pace or purpose, as when Will, Norrington and Jack engage in a triangular swordfight that because begin to make much sense. Davy Jones is a remarkable creation, but without humor or dash like Geoffrey Rush in "Black Pearl." And Knightley resembles a sullen, withdrawn Rachel Ward from "Against All Odds": Save one juvenile scene, there is none of the girl's good-natured, brash pluck to enjoy. When a person is gifted with the ability to embody sunny cheer, it seems a shame to have her mope incessantly.<br /><br />Bloom just has no charm or wits at all as Will, and Depp seems to have lost something as Jack - he's too much a dope. He meanders around. He talks a lot. He runs like a cartoon, arms flailing, legs scampering. Really try to sprint like this for 100 meters, and see if you're still standing upright. It's not the boozy devil of "Black Pearl" but a boozy dummy. Davenport, as Norrington, actually has the most presence and cleverness. Hollander, too, embodies a crisp intelligence. While the rest of the cast plays around in drunkenness, wild-eyed lust and debauchery, the two boring villains walk in, survey the landscape, and calmly grab the picture. They're creeps. But focused.</p></body></html>

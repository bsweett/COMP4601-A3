<meta name="summary" content="Paul Verhoeven's brilliant yet bleak view of a future where corporations rule"></head><body><p>"Robocop" is Paul Verhoeven's bleak view of the future. Here corporations make their own rules and use and destroy anything that stand in their way. Like Verhoeven's later "Total Recall" one can see this film as a devastating satire of Reagan-era America.<br /><br />Verhoeven indulges in his usual over-the-top violence and grim humour, which constantly skirt bad taste. However, there are lots of nice details, social commentary, imagination, action, and yes heart to keep most action fans happy.<br /><br />Followed by two terrible sequels.</p></body></html>

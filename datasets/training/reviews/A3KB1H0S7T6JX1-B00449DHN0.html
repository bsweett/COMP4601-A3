In addition, the movie portrays superbly and in great detail, both the corrupt politics as well as the attitudes and mentality of New Yorkers during the Civil War, thus providing insight into a very important period of US History. There is one scene in particular in which newly arrived Irishmen are getting off the ship that brought them to &quot;paradise&quot; (America) only to be drafted within minutes into the Federal Army in order to be sent down south to fight against the Confederacy.  A great movie indeed which shatters several misconceptions, deliberate and not, surrounding northern attitudes towards the Civil War and the Emancipation Proclamation i.e. northerners were anti-slavery and yet very racist, something which is difficult for people today to comprehend, and the fact that most northerners did not want to keep the southerners part of a country that they did not want to be part of, (needless to say going to war was not even an option for the average northerner and they had to be forced to sign up).  Lincoln's decision to order the bombardment of the Northern &quot;jewel&quot; city of NY by the US Navy in order to put down the NYC Draft Riots also provides for historical truths which had been suppressed for long years in the name of &quot;patriotism&quot;...</p></body></html>

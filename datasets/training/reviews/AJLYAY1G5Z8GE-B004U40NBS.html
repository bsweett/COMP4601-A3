This fact is actually good, because it gets the viewer inside the mind of psychologically disturbed people. This movie is about a psychotic ballerina, and it certainly got the viewer acquainted with her hurt and struggle. Just being able to make the viewer lose knowing the difference between dream and reality in the movie explains why this movie is a masterpiece, because it got you extremely acquainted with the star of the movie, a psychotic ballerina.<br /><br />This could be Natalie Portman's best performance till date, her performance in this film was simply breath taking.</p></body></html>

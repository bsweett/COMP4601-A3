It is highly ranked by film rating services, sometimes higher than Vertigo, but I can't agree.  There's something claustrophobic about what is essentially a movie set.  We are stuck in that lofty room with the big glass windows.  Jimmy Stewart peers across a courtyard and observes New Yorkers in their habitat.  When I was in elementary school we used to have projects called diorama's where we would take a shoebox and decorate it like a stage.  Each apartment in Hitch's diorama showcases a mostly silent vignette, the gorgeous dancer and her boyfriends, the lonely-heart middle-age lady, the sex crazed newlyweds, and the guy who kills his wife.<br /><br />Stewart can watch all the fun, but with a broken leg, he can't leave the apartment to do anything about it.  Hence, the suspense centers on Stewarts inability to maneuver when his girlfriend, fashion gal, Grace Kelly breaks into the killers apartment to find clues.  We see the killer coming down the hall and Jimmy can't warn her from his perch.<br /><br />Stewart and Kelly are interesting as a couple with opposite interests.  She's high fashion-society chick and he's a rough-it, world-traveling photographer.  These differences never resolve and Stewart appears maybe 15-20 years older than young marriage-scheming Grace.  The film is actually a stage play with stage play lighting and a who-dun-it plot. Great suspense, yes, but not as good as Vertigo by a mile.</p></body></html>

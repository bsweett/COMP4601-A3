<meta name="summary" content="Jason Bourne is back..."></head><body><p>At the end of "The Bourne Identity" Jason Bourne told his former employers that he wanted to be left alone.  He made it abundantly clear that if he felt he was being watched again, there would be no hesitation as to how fast he would return to bring the fight to their door.  Well, apparently the CIA wasn't paying attention and now they've pushed Jason Bourne too far and adventure ensues.  With many members of the original cast returning, Matt Damon being most important, and a new director (Paul Greengrass) leading the way "The Bourne Supremacy" will take audiences on another thrill ride that they won't soon forget.<br /><br />"The Bourne Supremacy" begins with Jason Bourne and his love, Marie enjoying a peaceful life far away from the insanity that plagued them during "The Bourne Identity".  Sadly, peace was not written into Jason Bourne's destiny, as someone is framing him for murder.  Now the CIA is hunting Jason yet again, and he doesn't know why they didn't listen when he told them to stay away from him, but he's going to hold up his end of the promise and now he's going to make them pay.<br /><br />A brilliant sequel to an excellent spy movie, "The Bourne Supremacy" delivers.  Frantic pacing and camera work do an excellent job of portraying the confused and fractured psyche of Jason Bourne, while not taking away from the movie.  Another terrific story with high caliber performances from the entire cast.  Leaving audiences waiting for the third installment in this hit franchise, "The Bourne Ultimatum".<br /><br />"The Bourne Supremacy" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.</p></body></html>

This movie has way too many characters in it!  Some of the characters are pathetic looking such as the Juggernaut and The Beast (who looks and sounds like they dyed a gorilla costume from the Planet of the Apes movies).  They waited to the last installment to introduce The Beast and the Angel who were original X-Men in the comics (X-Men was never a popular title until they changed the line-up adding Wolverine and Storm along with others).<br /><br />There is just too much going on for the viewer to grasp the entire plot unless you were intricately familiar with the comic stories.  The scene where Magneto rips and moves a large section of the Golden Gate Bridge was ridiculous.  The movie seemed to also rip off the humans being disolved into a sand-like substance by The Phoenix from the War of the Worlds movie (sans the clothes that remain after they disolve).<br /><br />The last scene of the movie sets it up for a sequel though I don't know if my head can stand another two hours of overdone special effects with too many characters (as much as the Fantastic Four was panned it was a lot easier to watch with only four heroes and one villian to focus on)!</p></body></html>

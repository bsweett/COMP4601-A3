The successes when they occur are generally huge box office blockbusters, such as; "Armageddon" and "ID4: Independence Day", unsuccessful examples would be the dismally boring films, "Deep Impact" and "Battlefield Earth".  Generally speaking, when Hollywood deems it time to do another end of the world disaster movie, the threat originates from somewhere in outer space, whether it be asteroids streaking towards Earth or aliens determined to annihilate us, space is where it all begins.  To shake things up Warner Brothers decided to do another end of the world disaster movie, but this time have the threat to civilization come from within Earth itself.<br /><br />The story of "The Core" is the `what if?' tale of the Earth's core (or engine as it is referred to in this movie) no longer spinning.  This event causes numerous geological disasters to occur that will culminate with the complete destruction of the ozone layer, allowing the sun's rays to blast us into oblivion.  To prevent this disaster from occurring a team of scientific specialists are brought in to drill a hole into the Earth's crust down to it's core, using an experimental ship to get them there, and detonating a nuclear bomb that will in theory `kick-start' the Earth's core into spinning again.<br /><br />With a hokey storyline pulled directly out of a B-movie science fiction film.  That borrows heavily from previous disaster films ("Armageddon" for example), Warner Brothers looked as if they had a gigantic stinker on their hands.  But surprisingly Warner Brothers pulled off an entertaining, though predictable summer movie.  Good acting and dazzling special effects provide enough distraction from the flimsy storyline that feels way too much like "Armageddon", in the sense that the scientists must pilot an experimental ship into the Earth's core and detonate a nuclear device to prevent disaster.  That sounds an awful lot like a team of oil drillers and NASA scientists being sent into space to detonate a nuclear bomb that will split a huge asteroid in two pieces, averting disaster.<br /><br />Complaints aside this was a well-acted film with a talented cast comprised of Delroy Lindo, Aaron Eckhart, and Hilary Swank.  Though I felt I had seen much of the movie before due to similarities, I still enjoyed the film for what it was, a good popcorn flick that is not intended to be thought provoking in any way at all.  If you are in the mood for a good disaster flick, or to just get away from it all for two hours then I recommend sitting down and watching "The Core".<br /><br />"The Core" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Ghost Rider versus Easy Rider"></head><body><p>Be warned: SPOILERS.<br /><br />I liked GHOST RIDER, I liked it a lot. And it's not because the acting was that great or the storyline that gripping. No, it was because Ghost Rider just looked so very damned cool on cinema (yes, I'm very shallow). Every time that flaming skull was on screen was yet another moment that made up for certain inadequacies which had held down the film. Admittedly, these comments are colored by my life-long addiction to comic books and superheroes. Although I'm not a big fan of Ghost Rider, I'm certainly familiar with his mythos and have read several of his issues. To me, the only change worth noting in the transition from comics to screen is that, now, Johnny Blaze guzzles jellybeans in a Martini glass and relaxes to Karen Carpenter tunes (I sense the Nic Cage influence at work here). Else, Johnny is the same tortured creature who, by day, is human and, by night, is a Spirit of Vengeance.<br /><br />The plot: When 17-year-old Johnny Blaze (Matt Long) discovers his father has developed cancer, he signs a pact in blood with the devil Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda, EASY RIDER) to save his dad. In return, the devil gets Johnny's soul. Many years later, Johnny (now played by Nicolas Cage, sporting an ungainly hairpiece) has followed in his father's footsteps and has become a motorcycle stunt rider in the Evel Kneivel mold. Nicknamed "Mr. Invincible" and hailed as a death defying superstar, Johnny prefaces every show with a soft utterance of his mantra "You can't live in fear" and has sought ever more dangerous stunts to dispel his suspicions that his success isn't due to his own skills but rather to the protective ministrations of Mephistopheles. He's about to find out.<br /><br />When Mephistopheles's son, the pigment-challenged, life force-sucking Blackheart (Wes Bentley), seeks to take over the family business - and just as Johnny becomes reacquainted with lost love Roxanne Simpson (Eva Mendes, ay caliente!) - Mephistopheles finally calls in his debt. Thus, Johnny unwillingly becomes the Ghost Rider, the Devil's emissary and bounty hunter. At night and in the presence of evil, Johnny goes thru a painful transformation as his body is supernaturally set on fire. In this guise, he is impervious to bullets and can take a serious amount of abuse. He can summon hellfire and can avail himself of the Penance Stare, an ability which allows him to mete out punishment to evildoers. And he has that smokin' hog...<br /><br />Mephistopheles contracts the Rider to take out Blackheart. But, naturally, it won't be easy. Blackheart has gathered into his own circle the Hidden (aka the Nephilim), three fallen angels with the elemental powers of air, water, and earth. And Blackheart also has a plan. He aims to dig up the lost contract stolen by another Ghost Rider one hundred fifty years ago, a contract boasting the names of souls so evil that that particular Rider rebelled against the Devil and skedaddled. Possessing this contract would presumably give Blackheart the edge over his father.<br /><br />Now, special effects-wise, I have absolutely no complaints. It's very hard to improve on the look of the Ghost Rider. Really, what's cooler than a burning skull? In terms of the Rider's physical manifestation, the movie, wisely, stuck with what's worked in the Marvel Universe. All the Rider's toys look awesome: the Hellcycle, his hellfire, and his flame-wracked chain. The Hidden, while turning out to be nothing but supernatural sissies after all, however, look very cool. And, when the Rider and the caretaker go for that one final ride together near the end, riding to "Ghost Riders in the Sky," well, the theater audience erupted in appreciative applause.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage has declared himself a longtime fan of Ghost Rider (he even has a tattoo of the Rider), and he brings to the film a sincerity and a sense of fun, as well as his patented idiosyncratic touches. In his hands, Johnny Blaze is definitely a more intriguing character, if more off the wall. Eva Mendes, beautiful girl, but her performance is somewhat lackluster here. What's missing, I think, is that fire and sexy spunk she displayed in movies such as HITCH and OUT OF TIME. Her best scene in this film may have been when she is stood up by Johnny in a restaurant date and she then half-jokingly asks the waiter if he thinks she's pretty (that waiter's a knucklehead, but I did chuckle at his response). Peter Fonda mines nostalgia for all its worth from his iconic Captain America role in EASY RIDER as he gets back in a motorcycle flick, though he doesn't ride a bike. I never was quite sure if I ended up liking his performance as Mephistopheles or not. Meanwhile, Sam Elliott continues to be his ol' reliable self. He even gets a bit of a chance to relive his  more virile cowboy days.<br /><br />Now an assortment of beefs. My personal opinion is that neither Matt Long (young Johnny) nor Raquel Alessi (young Roxanne) adequately bear a resemblance to their older counterparts. Not a big deal, but it did throw me off the viewing mood for a nano-second. The fact that the three elemental antagonists succumbed too easily to Ghost Rider bugged me somewhat. The earth elemental, in particular, had me irked with the discarding of his own element in his attack on the Rider. And when a comic book is translated into cinema, surely we can dispense with the stilted, hokey dialogue. As it is, I had to endure unabashed corn such as "My name is Legion - for we are many" and "I'm the only one that walk in both worlds - I'm Ghost Rider." Pleeease.<br /><br />But, even with my gripes, I still find myself overwhelmingly in favor of GHOST RIDER. He's such a viscerally compelling figure, and I can never have enough of his head just, poof, combusting. The CG is so well done. Of course, there are a few dead spots here and there in this flick (some in the opening sequences, some in the scenes with Cage and Elliott), but, mostly, the viewer's attention is engaged. And, certainly, whenever the Rider is on camera, the movie takes on a whole new dimension of appeal. I like the fact that the Ghost Rider seems to be more of a raging force of nature, more his own entity, rather than a controlled extension of Johnny Blaze, although, undoubtedly, he exercises somewhat of an influence. Another factor in this movie's favor is its sense of humor, some of which originates from Nicolas Cage himself and his quirkiness. I've read that Nicolas Cage has already provincially agreed to a sequel. I absolutely believe this inaugural GHOST RIDER will demand sequels.</p></body></html>

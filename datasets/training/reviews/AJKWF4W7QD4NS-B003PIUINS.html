<meta name="summary" content="A purposely trashy thriller"></head><body><p>While Final Destination 2 follows the plot of it's predecessor, the similarities between the films stops there.  The teen-melodrama and too good looking for their own good young stars are replaced (for the most part) with well orchestrated accident scenes and some very nice gore effects.  It all starts when Kimberly (A.J. Cook) has a premonition of a huge multi-car pile up and inadvertantly saves herself and a few others.  And then one by one, death comes calling with some over the top computer assisted and well orchestrated grisly deaths.  Ali Larter reprises her role from the first film as Clear Rivers, and Tony Todd returns in his cameo role as well.  Director David Ellis has crafted a purposely cheesy, trashy, and fun horror film that both outshines and pales in comparison to the original; and while it is very graphic and grisly for a mainstream horror film, it is never too mean spirited.  The Infinifilm DVD is another fine piece of product from New Line (although I personally like the Platinum Series of DVD's more), and the Bits &amp; Pieces featurette provides enough ample entertainment for horror afficiandos.</p></body></html>

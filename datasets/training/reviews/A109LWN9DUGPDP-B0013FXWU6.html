<meta name="summary" content="Pruduct review only the movie is 5 stars"></head><body><p>Personlly I think this is the best movie I've seen in many years but this dvd release is one big joke...hahaha.The 2 disc and single disc are put in cardboard dvd holders which in turn totally scratches the dvds like nothing I've ever seen.I havn't wacthed this dvd yet but if I can get through it without a freeze or skip I will be shocked.Paramount/Miramax go sit on it you all really put it to us on this one I want a complete refund for one packaged properly.I've never been this dissapointed on a dvd release and I've been through alot of them.</p></body></html>

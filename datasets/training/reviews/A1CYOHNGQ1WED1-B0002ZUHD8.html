<meta name="summary" content="Not accurate, but enjoyable"></head><body><p>This was a hard movie to rate. I was prepared to hate this movie after seeing the trailers last year because they looked horrid. But I didn't hate it. I have issues with it, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.<br /><br />My issues are that they use the character names from the Arthurian mythology but not the legend itself. If you don't like the legend, name your characters something else and don't use the name of King Arthur to sell your movie. Another issue is the movie is rife with inaccuracies from historical facts to weaponry and armor to battle tactics. Is it too much to ask that they get something right? The third issue is the atrocious dialog you come to expect from a Bruckheimer production.<br /><br />Once I was able to let these things go and relax, I enjoyed the movie. There are some good performances despite the silly things they have to say. There is a very good scene of a battle on a frozen lake where the ice is cracking and the Pictish warriors have a good look and feel to them. Don't think too much and don't expect to learn anything. Sit back, eat some popcorn and get lost in the 5th century.</p></body></html>

He then sets out to find out about the man was that had been with his wife, while dealing his difficult children. When complications arise regarding the sale of the family land, due to the wife's affair, the man has an interesting dilemma. That keeps the movie from being simply a crowd-pleasing tear-jerker, and inserts an element of mystery as to how the man will proceed regarding his family's inheritance. This was a realistic look at how a sudden tragedy can impact a family, with some humor sprinkled throughout to keep the audience engaged. This viewer was fully engaged and completely engrossed in the fate of this family. Outstanding performances highlight this one and solidify it as one of the year's top films.</p></body></html>

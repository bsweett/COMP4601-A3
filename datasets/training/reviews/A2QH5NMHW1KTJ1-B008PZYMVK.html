<meta name="summary" content="Possibly the weirdest film of all time, absolutely brilliant"></head><body><p>Warning:before watching this film you should realize that this could be one of the weirdest, craziest film of all time. It kept me scratching my head. <p>Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) is a puppeteer who is struggling for stardom in fame. In order to put food on the table, Craig decides to get a job. He finds himself as filing clerk. He then discovers a portal to the mind of John Malkovich. The portal allows you to be John Malkavich for 15. Your John Malkovich for fifteen minutes and then dumped in the turnpike of New Jersey. Then he falls in love with his co-worker Maxine (Catherine Keener)Craig, Maxine, and Craigs current wife Lotte (Cameron Diaz) charge $200 to let people be John Malkavich. But then as Lotte continues to go to the portal and then falls in love with Maxine, as Lotte continues going to the portal and being John Malkavich. It is then a war between Craig and Lotte of who's getting Maxine. It is a crazed script.<p>Personally out of this film I was just stunned. Watching this film once isn't really enough. It can be kind of disturbing in ways. Personally I thought the movie was a great success. But that's me, other people think it is a stupid film out of the story. But it is not, you will like it. Really before watching this I didn't even know who John Malkovich was, and still technically don't. And its weird to see someone play themselves. Since in this page they don't show what are the special features. So here they are.<p><br />?Trailer and tv spots<br />?Interview with director spike jonze<br />?Cast and crew<br />?Spikes photo album<br />?Art on the puppeteering<br />?Seven and a half floor orientation<br />Over all I think the films great. Just remember its weird. A must see though.</p></body></html>

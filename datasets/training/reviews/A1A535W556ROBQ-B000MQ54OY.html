<meta name="summary" content="Holiday fun on ice"></head><body><p>Not content to rely solely on the unusual mating habits of emperor pengins for his story, Miller turns this pengiun caper into a crusade against Antarctic fishing, as a community of penguins finds itself with a vastly depleted ocean, having to fight with nasty antarctic birds, leopard seals and other denizens of the deep for the slim pickings.  The weight of the world falls on the shoulders of Mumble, the "ugly duckling" of the brood, who has his rhythm in his feet rather than his voice.  The movie is chock full of soulful tunes as the emperor penguins compete for each other's affection through "love songs."  It also provides a convenient way to differentiate between the huge flightless commnunity.<br /><br />Mumble finds himself left out of the mating game, forced to journey across the vast expanse of Antarctic in search of the mysterious reasons for the depleted stock of fish.  He joins up with penguins of another breed, including one named "Lovelace," who mistakes a six-pack ring for a mantel of the gods, until it becomes a little too tight around the collar.  There are some tense moments, but my little girl didn't panic.  It was just a little bit too long for her to hold her coca-cola.  Eventually the great mystery is revealed and Mumble has the homecoming one would expect, with everyone dancing to his "Happy Feet."  It is easy to see why the movie became a big audience favorite over the holiday season, as it maintains a playful momentum throughout the story, and in the end the precious balance is restored.</p></body></html>

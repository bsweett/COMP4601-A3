There is an abundance of nudity in this film and mixed with this sort of gross out torture it really isn't my cup of tea. This movie is a thriller once it gets going and I found myself rooting for the "good guy" as he paid back some of these twisted F**KS! With all the really bad horror movies that come out, I can see why some would like this movie a lot. It is much better than most of the garbage they call horror these days. I am glad I watched it, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would but, I don't think I need to see it again. Life is too short to get wrapped up in this sort of sick disgusting SH** on a regular basis.<br /><br />Happy Holidays Everyone! It's a great big wonderful world we live in!............Sheesh!;-b</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="after a promising start, this lost me completely"></head><body><p>While I tried hard to like this, I found the acting so mediocre and the plot twists so outlandish, that I simply could not forget that this was a made-up thing and believe it for a time.  The actors all seem like amateurs - there is little chemistry between would-be lovers and friends, just lousy acting.<br /><br />ALso, it is not very good sci-fi:  I mean, like his dad this guy just has some kind of power to go back in time and change things by looking in his diary or at old photos (but not otherwise!).  Then, once he's back in the present, he can remember how things were, unlike anyone else who's affected.  While the ways that things change with his meddling is intriguing, it was too lacking in subtlty to seduce my imagination.  So I just couldn't believe any of it.<br /><br />Not recommended.</p></body></html>

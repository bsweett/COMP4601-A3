A police officer named Murphy is killed by a vicious gang of drug dealers, but a technology corporation manages to bring him back to life by turning what's left of his body into an unstoppable cyborg that will become the future of law enforcement = ROBOCOP. The Unrated Director's Cut is the only way to see this film: it shows scenes that were cut from the theatrical release in order to avoid an 'X' rating, it has an interesting commentary track from the film's director - writers - and producers, it has two theatrical trailers, storyboards from the film, and a written essay on the making of the film.</p></body></html>

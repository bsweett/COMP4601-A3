<meta name="summary" content="Could have been even better with decent cast"></head><body><p>This movie, from the guys who brought us the SAW trilogy, is going to disappoint anyone who is expecting that sort of gore, torture and griminess.  Okay, it is grimy, but it is not gory.  Despite an R rating, it's a fairly tame CREEPY supernatural story.  It feels very old school, almost like an episode of NIGHT GALLERY.<br /><br />The creepy ventriloquist's doll Billy, who actually does almost nothing in the movie...is the STAR.  Just sitting there, lovingly photographed in shadow...he'll make the hairs on your neck stand up.  We respond to him in an illogical way, but it can't be helped.  Those dummies are just a little weird.<br /><br />The story of DEAD SILENCE is not terribly original, but it does stay true to the expectations of the form.  It also has a decent surprise ending that you'll probably see coming...but only a few minutes before our "hero" does.  My wife, 14 year old daughter and I were all quite satisfied.  This is a genre film that for a change of pace, actually delivers some solid chills...unlike THE MESSENGERS, DARK WATER, etc. etc.<br /><br />It does have some problems, though.  Namely Ryan Kwantan, the lead actor in the film who is such a dreadful actor I felt actually angry at him for ruining the film.  Totally incapable of any display of convincing emotion.  Just the pits.  And Donnie Wahlberg mostly looks bored by his character...a cop who is the worst law-enforcement officer ever and apparently works for a police force that consists of just him.  The film is low-budget, but some decent CGI work saves it.  But the poor casting really shows the low-budget seams.<br /><br />It's an okay film that could have been more.</p></body></html>

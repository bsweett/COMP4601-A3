There were some pretty funny moments, the cast had great chemistry and made the film all the more charming. The plot is a but odd and it gets itself cross eyed a few times but if you just sit back and enjoy it like we did you'll have a great time. Jennifer Aniston and Shirley MacLaine were great. RUMOR HAS IT... was decent but nothing that special, just a nice way to enjoy 2 hours at the movies.<br /><br />Rating: 8/10</p></body></html>

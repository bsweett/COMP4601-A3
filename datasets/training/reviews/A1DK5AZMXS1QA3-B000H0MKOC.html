<meta name="summary" content="Did the tobacco industry pay for this?"></head><body><p>Once in a while a movie comes along that totally tears apart the society that spawned it thru the use of wit, irony, sarcasm and pointed remarks.  This comedy is one of these movies.  The movie revolves around the life and career of Nick Naylor, PR person for Big Tobacco, and begins with him taking on and taking out his political opponents live on a national talk show.  We then come to see him comment and explain his work to his son, his son's classmates, his counterparts in the alcohol and firearms industries, his boss, and unfortunately for him, an investigative reporter with a knack for twisting words every bit as much as him.  Put together, we see the tobacco industry and the PR industry stood on its head and examined from the top down.<br /><br />Though smooth, ironies abound in the life of Nick.  First, his ex-wife is now married to a doctor who hates smoking.  Second, his opponents in the health care industry and Congress actually make him invaluable to Big Tobacco by their efforts to limit smoking.  Third, he uses the most roundabout reverse psychology possible to bribe an ex-smoker into keeping mum about the hazards of tobacco use.  Watching the movie from beginning to end, and seeing how the foes and friends of tobacco act, we get an interesting, and funny, examination of American society.  All in all, a great movie.  It is rated R for sex scenes between the protagonist and Katie Holmes' character, but nothing is shown so the movie is appropriate for anyone in their teens and older.</p></body></html>

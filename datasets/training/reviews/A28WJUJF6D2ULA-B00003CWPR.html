<meta name="summary" content="Kubrick Goes Out With A Near Masterpiece"></head><body><p>Eyes Wide Shut was released in 1999 after Stanley Kubrick's death, and was misrepresented by well-meaning but misguided publicists as something resembling a non-stop orgy of sex, which it's simply not. If anything this mysterious film is the epitome of non-eroticism. So what is it? It is a somewhat quiet film about a human being suddenly cast into a self-authored but barely understood quest. It is about jealousy, sexual exploration, insecurity, love, lust, danger, and ultimately redemption and forgiveness. The sets Kubrick had designed and created, as he did in so many of his previous films, are astonishing in their scale and intricacy, and the soundtrack, such as it exists in this whisperingly still movie, hit exactly the right notes at the right moments, especially Jocelyn Pook's soul-stirring composition for the Black Mass scene at the exact center of this story. Eyes Wide Shut walks a thin line between metaphor and reality, wishful fantasy and actual happenings. How much of this story is real and how much takes place in the imagination of its central character, here played with unusual depth by Tom Cruise? I fall into the "it all happened" camp but I can certainly see how the reverse might be true.<br /><br />In Eyes Wide Shut, a handsome, successful young doctor, Bill Harford, finds the security of his comfortable life thrown askew when in the wake of a Christmas party in which he and his wife, played by Nicole Kidman, both interacted with strangers in a light, flirtatious manner, his wife reveals to him how close she once came to having an affair with a Naval officer. What follows next takes place primarily in the course of a single dream-like night as Harford leaves home to go to the deathbed of a long-time patient, and then rapidly plummets into a strange world of sexual promise and danger. Harford has a patient throw herself at him (no other description fits), encounters an attractive prostitute and allows himself to return---to an unforeseen outcome---with her to her flat, then he persuades an old friend, an itinerate musician, to let him to infiltrate a party at a lavish estate in the country, where the masked guests, presumably among New York's society elite, engage in unabashed sex acts amidst a setting reminiscent of the orgies of centuries past.<br /><br />In the aftermath of this life-altering night, Harford's self-confidence, in fact his very identity, is shaken to the core. He feels he has become embroiled in what was possibly a murder, for which he is to blame.  Far from being the confident, wealthy physician from the opening quarter of the movie, Harford is a desperate man who seeks out answers, all the while clearly terrified of the enlightenment those answers might bring. The soft world of the night becomes a harsh labyrinth of confusion as we again trail Harford, this time out into the daylight, where we share his desires to know more. Ultimately we must accept, as does Harford, the only answers he receives, satisfactory or not, and are glad when he embraces the closure he is given by both a friend and more unexpectedly, by his wife.<br /><br />Eyes Wide Shut is imperfect. A few of the acting performances fall short, and the spark of romance seems lacking between Cruise and Kidman (real life provided the answers for why) but when taken as a whole, this story, these visuals, the music, the intricate display of mastery of craft that is here in Eyes Wide Shut, all this combines to be a five-star production, and it is almost an all-time motion picture masterpiece.</p></body></html>

This is a wonderfully atmospheric horror film with a laughably preposterous story, so much so that it's actually a lot of fun to watch. Anyone who says that this film is bad is absolutely right. And no wonder; it was written by Leigh Whannell and directed by James Wan, the same men responsible for 2004's highly effective but equally preposterous "Saw." For this new film, they utilize all the best horror movie methods imaginable, from minimal lighting to unnerving close-ups to foggy, overgrown cemeteries. They've also crafted a plot without any degree of plausibility, especially when it comes to the obligatory twist ending; to say that the final revelation is overwhelmingly unrealistic would be an understatement. To say that it still succeeds in being shocking wouldn't be surprising.<br /><br />Can such a film be given any credit? Yes, but not in the way you might think; I have a strong feeling that the story was supposed to be ridiculous, if not for the sake of simplicity, then for the sake of making the disturbing visuals and pop out scares more effective. At the very least, this film actually has a story, which is more than I can say for hopeless fright fests like "The Abandoned." Made in the tradition of films like "Child's Play" and "Puppet Master," "Dead Silence" is a ghost story that takes a beloved child-friendly activity--ventriloquism--and turns it into a horrific spectacle. Dummies have never been as frightening as they are in this film, with their smooth, pale skins and their large, unhinged jaws and their big, glassy eyes that seem to stare directly into the audience.<br /><br />It begins when Jamie Ashen (Ryan Kwanten) and his wife, Lisa (Laura Regan), receive a mysterious package. They open it to find a ventriloquist dummy crafted into a boy. The thing is damn creepy, to say the least, but it seems to have no effect on Lisa, who plays with it, talks to it, and even props it upright on her bed. Only when Jamie goes to pick up dinner does she discover the dummy's true nature, and by then, it's too late for her. First, a majority of the ambient noises go silent: a record player spins slower and slower until it stops; a whistling teakettle is muted, even as steam spews from the spout; a ticking clock goes quiet. All she can hear is her own breathing. That, and bizarre laughter coming from the bedroom.<br /><br />When Jamie returns, he finds his beloved wife propped up in bed, her mouth opened unnaturally wide and her tongue forcefully ripped out. Thus begins Jamie's nightmare, made worse by the fact that he's the prime suspect in his wife's murder. Assigned to his case is Detective Jim Lipton (Donnie Wahlberg), a man who, for whatever reason, compulsively uses an electric shaver. He was so condescending that I just wanted to smack him upside the head; he speaks down to Jamie, showing him the same respect a bratty child would be shown. I suppose I shouldn't complain; every horror movie of this sort requires the annoying, intrusive side character, mostly because the audience takes pleasure in seeing him or her die at some point (whether or not Lipton dies, I'll leave for you to discover).<br /><br />Against Lipton's orders, Jamie returns to his ailing hometown of Raven's Fair for Lisa's funeral. He takes the mysterious dummy with him, apparently in order to "get some answers" (which translates as, "only for the sake of plot advancement"). This is because he remembers a nursery rhyme he used to be told as a child: "Beware the stare of Mary Shaw. / She had no children, only dolls. / And if you see her in your dream, / Be sure to never, ever scream." The legend of Mary Shaw--an early twentieth century ventriloquist (Judith Roberts)--is no longer spoken of in Raven's Fair, according to Henry Walker (Michael Fairman) the town's aging mortician.<br /><br />Let's examine this legend. In the early 1940s, a local boy had gone missing. Because this boy had publicly humiliated Shaw during one of her shows ("I can see your lips moving!" he shouts), the town immediately suspected that she had something to do with his disappearance. This prompts a group of vigilantes to take justice into their own hands, first by cutting out Shaw's tongue, second by murdering her. But nothing stays buried forever (literally); over the years, many people have been savagely murdered, each victim having his or her tongue ripped out. It would seem that, through her dummies, the ghost of Mary Shaw is "silencing" the families of those who murdered her.<br /><br />But how does this all connect with Jamie? He first turns to his father, Edward (Bob Gunton), for information, but he quickly sees that it's useless. For one thing, they haven't gotten along in years. For another thing, he's now wheelchair bound from a stroke, completely dependent on the care of his third wife, the sickeningly sweet Ella (Amber Valletta). It seems that Jamie's only resource is Henry; not only did he attend one of Shaw's shows as a boy, he also had an interesting encounter with her body as she was being prepped for burial. One would expect nothing less from this kind of film, especially since her final wish was to be transformed into a dummy. Can you imagine a human head with slits on both sides of the mouth and bulgy glass eyes?<br /><br />It was also her wish that each of her hundred or so dummies be buried. But they didn't stay buried for long, as Jamie and Lipton discover during the climactic sequence in Shaw's dilapidated theater. They also discover a book of sketches, specifically instructions on constructing handmade dummies. Attached is a flap of paper with the words "How to Build the Perfect Dummy" written on it. I won't say what it's in reference to, but I will say that it paves the way for the aforementioned twist ending, a moment that was both frightening and silly. Pretty much all of "Dead Silence" can be described the same way, which I believe was intentional on the filmmaker's part. It's horrifying to see a dummy turning to gaze at someone, especially when no one is operating it. Likewise, it's funny to hear lines like, "There are things you remember, and then there are things you never forget." Now that's truly the work of a gifted screenwriter.<br /><br />Yes, "Dead Silence" is a bad movie, but like many classic horror films, it's so bad that it's good. It's everything a story about possessed dummies should be, and no more. Whether or not this makes it worth recommending is open for debate; I'm giving it four stars because I had fun watching it, and because it succeeds in creating the right horror movie atmosphere. For some of you, this will not be enough, and that's certainly understandable; you have my permission to dismiss this movie and go in search of something more meaningful.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="INCREDIBLY WELL DONE"></head><body><p>THE INCREDIBLES will undoubtedly take animation into a whole new realm.  Once restricted to kiddie type movies with talking fish, toys, and or monsters, THE INCREDIBLES is an animated James Bond movie with a dash of LEAVE IT TO BEAVER and FATHER KNOWS BEST.  Writer/director Brad Bird gives us endless scenes of peril, fast chases, derring do and a considerable amount of violence for the "expected" animated film.  But as I said, this is not what we are accustomed to in animated entertainment.  The animation in this film is unquestionably incredible; you won't remember seeing anything quite this cinematic like in your usual animated fare.  The voice actors are superb, from Craig T. Nelson's Mr. Incredible to Brad Bird's amazing Edna Mode; from Holly Hunter's Elastigirl to Jason Lee's Sindrome.  The Actors Guild should protest the lack of credit the voice actors are given in these films.  In the closing credits, while struggling to see who voiced who, the voice cast is so small one can hardly read it, while all the tech guys are larger than life.  I for one am interested in who did what, so that's just a hint for future animated films.  Don't forget the movie would be nothing without the voices, folks!<br /><br />Anyway, to criticize this movie in any way would be almost anti-American, so I'll only say that while this movie is definitely a crowd pleaser and sets new standards, it is a little too violent in nature for younger children and it only reinforces the amount of violence propagated by our video games and now our cartoons.  So, while I hope we see more imaginative films like this one, I hope Pixar and others don't forget the animated films that AREN'T realistic or lifelike.  Movies still need to take us to places that we aren't going to feel like we live in; talking animals, far out space adventures..we still have a place for them, that I hope the success of THE INCREDIBLES does not diminish.  Nonetheless, THE INCREDIBLES is an incredible achievement.</p></body></html>

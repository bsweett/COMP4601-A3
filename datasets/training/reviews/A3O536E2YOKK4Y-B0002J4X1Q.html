I don't play video games so this review is based solely on the film.<br /><br />Since its release I never gave the film any thought, but the red film poster/dvd cover with Milla Jovovich in a ripped red dress somehow snuck into my subconscious over the years. Then I caught a 15-minute snippet of the film while channel surfing recently (not knowing it was "Resident Evil"). The part I saw was near the beginning where Milla mysteriously wakes up in a shower in a mansion. She obviously doesn't know who she is or where she's at and wanders around the mansion trying to figure things out when -- BAM! -- a team of commandos storm the mansion and take her via secret subway to a vast underground research/development complex called The Hive, which belongs to The Umbrella Corporation.<br /><br />That's all I saw. I didn't have time to watch anymore but I decided right there to pick up the dvd. The set-up is truly intriguing and, in ways, brilliant.<br /><br />[PLOT SPOILER! Don't read the next two paragraphs unless you want to know the basic plot] After viewing the dvd I discovered that a biological "accident" causes the supercomputer that runs The Hive to shut down the entire facility and gas the 500 workers to death. The mansion is a secret emergency entrance and the commandos are sent by the Umbrella Corporation to go down and find out what caused the supercomputer (called the Red Queen) to shut down the facility and kill the people.<br /><br />It turns out that a virus has turned the 500 Umbrella employees into hideous flesh-eating zombies (I know this sounds totally absurd but the way it's explained in the film is somehow believable). Milla and the commando team slowly discover this. Meahwhile the Red Queen has trapped them in the Hive with the zombies and other undead creatures. Can they get out alive? [END SPOILER].<br /><br />POSITIVES:<br /><br />-- As already noted, the opening is truly intriguing, successfully capturing the viewer's attention.<br /><br />-- The slow revelation of the mystery is superb, including who Milla really is.<br /><br />-- Milla herself is stunning. The entire film she runs around in a red dress with a slit up the side. Her face and expressions are magnificent.<br /><br />-- The story itself and the delivery (sets, etc.) ring of brilliance. This is sci-fi of the highest order.<br /><br />-- The film features a cool eerie score highlighted by some rocking nu-metal acts.<br /><br />NEGATIVES:<br /><br />-- Although "Resident Evil" is original in many ways it's sometimes reminiscent of other films like "Aliens" and "Dawn of the Dead." Hence, some things are predictable; for instance, anyone who gets bitten by a zombie is gonna eventually turn into one.<br /><br />-- To be expected, the mystery build-up in the first hour is better than the last half hour, which is action-filled. Why? Mindless action with numerous quick edits somehow always becomes boring. Wouldn't it be great if a sci-fi/horror film like this ended in a truly unconventional blow-your-mind way (e.g. the original "Planet of the Apes")? But the final sequence makes up for it, sort of. Besides, since the film is based on a video game the zombie/human slaughter comes with the territory.<br /><br />The film runs 95 minutes before the credits roll.<br /><br />PERSONAL GRADE: A-</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Spooky and Amazing"></head><body><p>The classic tale of the Headless Horseman, brought to life by Tim Burton. Johnny Depp is so believable as Icabod Crane. And Christopher Walken is the perfect choice for the Headless Horseman. The plot and story will definately keep you on the edge of your seat. Also amazing was the scenery. I kept trying to figure out if it was a built set, or special effects, or a combination. Burton has made the tale of the Headless Horseman even more frightening than you can imagine.</p></body></html>

Mackye GruberEvan's attempt at the time-travelling, life-altering thriller.  At times the film succeeds as a compelling drama, but the film is not supported by solid acting, a complete, cohesive script, and formidable direction and execution.  Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher in a fairly sedated performance), as a young boy, endured a few childhood trauma along with his three childhood friends, Kallie, Tommy, and Lenny, such as his friend's pedophile father (played eerily by Eric Stoltz). Evan has some kind of problem, however, that causes him to blackout during these traumatic, life changing events. These past events obviously effect the present as they mold the person the four children will become and it isn't always pretty.  As a psychology major, Evan is inspired to study memory patterns, and consequently, discovers his neurological knack for forcing himself to remember things. When he does, he is able to transplant himself back to that time (through the help of his journals that he kept since he was 7) and, still knowing what he knows in the present, is able to alter the past, and also the present. So, his goal is to make all of his friends' and mother's lives at least as perfect as they can be by wiping out as much of the bad stuff as he possibly can. But not everything works well on the first try. In other words, it is an opportunity to be able to "redo" his past. Evan is able to give everyone a second (and third, and fourth) chance at life.<br /><br />The main problem with "The Butterfly Effect" is that it doesn't transcend this level but simply thinks that it does. The chain reaction of events that result from Evan's actions may be drastic, but there is nothing unpredictable about them. He affects crucial events in his life and the result are straightforward, logical consequenced, hardly akin to stepping on an insect and changing the course of man. The writers could have used far more imagination when devising the plot. Other changes that the character makes are unconvincing, such as the notion that he could prevent the Eric Stoltz character from abusing his daughter by simply threatening him on one occasion, a scene that again misses the point. It's not a good example of little things affecting the world in big ways. It's an example of wishful thinking, plain and simple. When the scenario finally goes wrong, it happens because of the way Kutcher's character acts in the altered present, not because of the altered time-line itself.<br /><br />The film's first forty-five minutes are somewhat more promising. These early scenes deal with Kutcher's childhood experiences, how he blacks out whenever his life becomes too traumatic. It's an intriguing setup that would have left me wondering where the story was headed had I not already seen the trailer, where I learned that it was going to be about time travel. On a dramatic level, the movie's biggest failing is that it never follows through with the tone it sets up in the beginning. We're promised a thriller, but the movie degenerates into what can best be described as an episodic black comedy, almost a dark version of "Bedazzled."  Ultimately, this movie has nothing new to contribute to the time travel genre. While it tries to pass itself off as a twist on the old premise, it quickly becomes a fairly routine thriller about a man tweaking his past. I hope that the next time they decide to do such a film, they'll leave cool metaphors like butterfly effects to a script that is truly willing to deal with such concepts instead of simply pretending to.</p></body></html>

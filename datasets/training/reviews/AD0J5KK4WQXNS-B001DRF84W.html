<meta name="summary" content="Except for the Hulk... its bad and needs editing!"></head><body><p>Apart from when the Hulk is on the screen, this film suffers from Eric Banality! and Ang Lee hits a career low in total misdirection. Okay, don't get me wrong, Ang Lee probably said to himself "Okay, this movie is about the Hulk but it is also about family relationships, genetics and all these other things that should make this action film a little better" which is good, but then he goes and directs a version of the Hulk that is anything but action packed at all and it ends up being a really sloppy soap-opera with zero drama or suspense.<p>Eric Bana is usually great but here he delivers a totally flat performance. The story is extremely convoluted and while it tries so hard to be MARVEL, Lee just can not stop himself from playing with the AVID and while he toys with his new montage to make the film look like a comic (great idea but overused!), he forgets to EDIT the film at all. It does not even register as a Superhero movie and starts to move into "Disaster Flick" territory only to be completely confused about itself. At the same time Lee is trying to make the film more adult but misses the connection there and kids will be bored to death with what little he has provided for them in terms of the hulk smashing things up which is what they want to see.<p>Its a film that does not know what it wants to be. In short, another director may have been a better choice and the film screams Edit me! Maybe this is one of the first movies that should receive a new directors cut where the film is actually 30 minutes shorter. Having said that the special effects are very good but there is not enough action sequences to actually make it worth your while.<p>Its no Spiderman by a long shot.</p></body></html>

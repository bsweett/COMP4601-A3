<meta name="summary" content="films , like everything in life , are subjective"></head><body><p>i read a **** star by film critic Roger Ebert about this film around the time of its' release . i'm sorry to state that i don't agree with Roger nearly as much as i used to . here i'm very much in agreement . today i was lucky enough to get a copy of the film at a very modest price . i had forgotten about this superb picture in the time between seeing it from the FLIX and now . i can't even begin to imagine what you'll think of it ? i think it's a rare treat . P.S. Roger , big love and hang in there my favorite film critic . it's nice to hear your voice again . all the best to you and Chaz .</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good visual, intelligent action movie"></head><body><p>After the obnoxious MI 2, Tom Cruise decided to work with a much better director than Jon Woo!! Enter Mr. Steven Spielberg,the master.<p>The movie is very good, fast paced and, more important, INTELLIGENT. It's not ultra-violent, much on teh contrary. It builds its momentum to a climax.<p>I enjoyed it a lot.</p></body></html>

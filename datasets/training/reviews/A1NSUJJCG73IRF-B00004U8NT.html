<meta name="summary" content="Close Encounters of the Third Kind  (1977)"></head><body><p>Director:  Steven Spielberg<br />Cast:  Richard Dreyfuss, Francois Truffaut, Teri Garr, Melinda Dillon.<br />Running Time: 137 minutes.<br />Rated PG for mild language and some intense situations.<p>Fresh off the outrageous success of his first hit &quot;Jaws&quot;, Steven Spielberg creates the extra-terrestrial epic &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;.  While obviously a film about aliens, Spielberg uses star Richard Dreyfuss as a chess piece to how the mystique and mystery of a foreign being can not only cause a man to go crazy, but can ultimately influence mankind as a whole.<p>Dreyfuss is extremely under-rated in his performance as a man driven to the brink as he experiences an otherworldy encounter with extra-terrestrials while inside of his vehicle.  Not knowing the affect this would later have on his life, he returns home as if nothing happened.  Dreyfuss's behavior grows stranger and stranger (he first makes a mountain out of mashed potatoes at the dinner table, then creates an even larger model of this mysterious mountain out of his yard while still inside his house), he realizes that he most confront this incredible feeling that has overcome his mind and search for answers.  What he encounters is magical and unbelievable.<p>Spielberg's direction is top-notch and sincere, proving that his previous sucess was not a fluke.  Much like his other alien film, &quot;E.T&quot;, &quot;Close Encounters...&quot; provides  a symbolic theme that is far more significant than what the aliens look like or what planet they came from.  With the peformance of Dreyfuss, Spielberg is able to to show that it is okay for all of us to return to the kid we once were, and to explore all of the questions that we all want answers for.  A true spectacle of a film with superb special effects, a wonderful musical score by John Williams, and a child-like charm that is for the whole family.</p></body></html>

Nothing complex.  This simple approach to horror really works well.  His three Halloween movies fall into this category as well (Halloween, Halloween II, and Halloween III).  The Fog, however, is pretty unique.  I think the setting of the movie is its greatest asset.  This movie takes place in the seaside village of Antonio Bay, California.  The basic story is that on the night of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the town, a thick fog emerges from the bay area and comes ashore.  But what also comes ashore in the fog are the ghosts of murdered sailors who want to get revenge for the sins of the town's founding fathers a century earlier.  Time is of the essence, for the town's people must solve a crime that's a century old, or die.  As the fog rolls in, the ghosts do too, and the eerieness level increases.<br /><br />This movie stars Adrienne Barbeau (John Carpenter's wife at the time) as the lighthouse disc jockey, Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween, Halloween II, Halloween H2O, etc.), Janet Leigh (Curtis's real life mother, and the star of Psycho), John Houseman, Hal Holbrook, Charles Cyphers (Halloween, Halloween II), and Tom Atkins (Halloween III).  The acting is good throughout.  John Carpenter himself even appears in the movie very briefly near the beginning.  In my opinion the strongest acting performance was by Adrienne Barbeau.  She has a good disc jockey voice and her on-air demeanor during the fog crisis is a strong point of the movie.<br /><br />This DVD comes with special features, two of which are called "Tales From The Mist - Inside 'The Fog' Documentary" and "Fear On Film - Inside 'The Fog' Documentary".  There are also outtakes, an advertising gallery, a storyboard-to-film comparison, and interesting audio commentary by John Carpenter and Debra Hill.<br /><br />If you want to watch a very good horror movie that is vintage John Carpenter, then The Fog is your movie.  I highly recommend it.  It's a good movie to watch late on Halloween night after the trick-or-treaters have gone home and the jack-o-lantern has been extinguished.</p></body></html>

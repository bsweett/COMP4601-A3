<meta name="summary" content="Ah, sweet deceit..."></head><body><p>Deception has always been an interesting theme, but hardly as well presented as in "Closer", and in spades. Other reviewers were put off by it, but in the hands of Master Mike Nichols, this is only another classic in the history of the subject (Shakespeare, Oedipus Rex, Lysistrata, etc.). This kind of deceit involves a bunch of pretty people, which may not include you nor I; still, similar things have probably happened to us that we can relate to.Naysaying reviewers might be in denial, but, fact is, the brilliant cast and author (and director) have presented a brutal and honest slice of ugliness that is difficult to ignore. We can only hope to learn, listen and grow from this. Jude Law, Clive Owen & Natalie Portman were applauded for their roles. I've always been a fan of Julia Roberts, and I thought she was their equal. All are appalling people, and there's no love to be lost for any of them. The change in time-frame was confusing, but added to the angst.  A thoughtful, thinking-persons film.The references to Mozart & Rossini throughout are appropriate.</p></body></html>

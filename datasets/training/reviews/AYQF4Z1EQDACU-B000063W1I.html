"E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial" A film with a legendary title character,music,quotes and it's one of the greatest science fiction films of all time. Aside from Star Wars Episode IV, E.T. is my favorite SC-FI film and overall one of my favorites. E.T. is a Masterpiece, a wonderus gem to behold, the most beautiful friendship since "Casablanca" You could never forget this film and if you insanley did, you might as well forget what a movie is.

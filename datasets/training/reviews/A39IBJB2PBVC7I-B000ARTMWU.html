High Tension is a one-gadget movie with plot holes large enough to drive a Home Depot truck loaded with chain saws through.  The war in Vietnam did not have this much senseless violence.  De France is quite attractive in her blood-spattered T-shirt but she'd be a lot more attractive if she spent a little less time sawing people's heads off, nailing their feet to the floor, and torturing them in various other ways.  Not seeing this movie isn't good enough.  You will never again be a whole person until you've forgotten that it exists.</p></body></html>

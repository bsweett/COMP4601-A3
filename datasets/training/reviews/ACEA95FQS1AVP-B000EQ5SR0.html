The plot had potential--except that it didn't appear until the last 15 minutes.  The writers spent too much time with techno gadgets (YOU ARE IN THE FUTURE) crap, and showing Aeon's acrobatics (ISN'T SHE COOL?) to create any decent suspense.  Charlize Theron, Oscar Winner, is evidently too good to wear the more revealing costume Aeon wore in the series.  Ironic--Hollywood felt the need to put Halley Berry in a cut to ribbons costume when the original Catwoman was fully suited in leather, but they do the reverse here. Go figure.  Overall the movie was okay--a rental.<br /><br />It's these subpar, flighty movies with big name actresses that give Science Fiction/Fantasy a bad name.  And give Hollywood the mistaken impression that the public doesn't want action movies with heroines.  No, we want GOOD action movies with heroines.  And Jennifer Garner, Halle Berry and Charlize Theron aren't talented enough (or too talented?) to supply them.  I guess all my hopes are now pinned on Wonder Woman, please let her be a newcomer....</p></body></html>

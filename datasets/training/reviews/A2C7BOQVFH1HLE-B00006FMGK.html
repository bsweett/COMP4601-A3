<meta name="summary" content="Is That It?"></head><body><p>Being a long-time fan of Trek and especially of the Classic and DS9 incarnations, I've always had a bittersweet relationship with the ST:TNG concept.  I've never been able to understand the need for a ship's counselor as a senior member of the staff with a place on the bridge especially when you have an equally if not more competent Guinan and located where she should be to be an effective counselor i.e. as a bar tender.<br /><br />I've also wondered just what role Beverly Crusher plays other than just to blindly copy the Bones McCoy character from classic trek.  I detest the whole ridiculous Q storyline and overall, I found ST:TNG a totally miscast and unbalanced series except perhaps for Picard, Riker, Data, Jeordie and Worf.  And so it has always been painful for me to watch most of the episodes let alone the movies and yet with the exception of the Borg movie, I've enjoyed the ST:TNG movies the least and although this "final" one has some good points going for it. I can't help but feel that I've been shortchanged in some way.<br /><br />The whole dark mood of the film just wasn't Trek for me while it probably would have fit in say a Batman movie like say a movie of the "Dark Knight Returns" or something like that, this gothic type feel just didn't fit for me in this movie.  I've watched it a few times and perhaps it will grow on me but each time I watch I get the feeling in my tummy that I get when I eat a heavily hyped up meal that just didn't deliver.<br /><br />The dvd though has decent special features with a few documentaries and the Dolby 5.1 surround sound is very good although I regret not getting the widescreen version instead of this full-screen version and I wonder if they could have gotten a DTS sound option included as well.<br /><br />Overall, I think if the mood was more "Trek" instead of this "Jack the Ripper" gothic type thing, I would have probably enjoyed this a lot more.  Also, one of the deleted scenes was very amusing with the new number 1 trying to please Picard as well as the chairs with seat belts which really should have been included in the main picture and they would have certainly helped with the cheerful mood that is sadly missing in the picture.  Hopefully they would be included in a future director's cut that is brighter and has more of a "Trek" feel to it.<br /><br />Verdict: Wait for an improved director's cut with the good deleted scenes included and also for a widescreen version preferably in Blu-ray.</p></body></html>

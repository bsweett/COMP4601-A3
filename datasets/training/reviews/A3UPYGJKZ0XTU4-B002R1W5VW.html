<meta name="summary" content="Good Grift, but Fails on Other Counts."></head><body><p>Roy (Nicholas Cage) is an obsessive-compulsive con man who functions remarkably well when he's bilking victims out of their hard-earned cash, but is a complete wreck in his personal life. Frank (Sam Rockwell) is Roy's partner and prot&eacute;g&eacute; in a complicated phone scam business. Desperate for medication, Roy visits a psychiatrist (Bruce Altman) who encourages him to seek out the child he never knew from his previous marriage. But Roy finds that he's gotten more than he bargained for when his long lost 14-year-old daughter, Angela (Alison Lohman) disrupts his ordered life just as Roy is in the middle of a delicate and very lucrative con.<p>"Matchstick Men" was adapted for the screen by Nicholas and Ted Griffin from the novel of the same name by Eric Garcia. Ridley Scott, in a departure from his usual action fare, directs this idiosyncratic "dramedy". The cast is all superb. Nobody does nervous ticks like Nicholas Cage, even though I'm tired of seeing him do them. Part of the trouble with this film comes from some confusion in its tone: It might have been a brooding character study, but director Scott wanted it to be a black comedy. Good call, but the film isn't funny enough to captivate the audience on that level. It doesn't impress as a character study because all of the characters are annoying. That's played for laughs, but doesn't consistently succeed because the film is just so self-absorbed. Black comedy or character study aside -which is where you will find them- "Matchstick Men" is a Grift Movie. And the grift works. It's a good one, and this is where "Matchstick Men" is successful. This is a good-looking film; I like the cinematography and production design. The performances are impressive. But it's a little rough to sit through (The second half is better than the first, so don't give up too soon). It just doesn't come across as it should. I recommend "Matchstick Men" to fans of grift movies and fans of Nic Cage, but I don't think its successes are going to outweigh the tedium for anyone else.<p>The DVD: Bonus features include a making-of documentary entitled "Tricks of the Trade", an audio commentary by director Ridley Scott, screenwriter Nicholas Griffin, and  screenwriter/producer Ted Griffin, and  a theatrical trailer. "Tricks of the Trade" has three parts: pre-production, production, and post-production, and includes interviews with Ridley  Scott, the film's casting director, writers, producers, author Eric Garcia, and Hans Zimmer, who composed the film's score. It follows the making of "Matchstick Men", step-by-step, through all stages of production, which is plodding and tedious, but it gives a realistic picture of the movie-making experience instead of concentrating on eventful highlights. I think the documentary will bore most viewers, but film students might find it educational. The audio commentary is good but a little awkward, because Ridley Scott and the Griffin brothers seem to have taped their contributions at different times. They talk about the genesis of the film and storytelling decisions that were made along the way, but not technical stuff. Ridley Scott's contributions are especially interesting. Subtitles are available in English, French, and Spanish, and dubbing is available in French.</p></body></html>

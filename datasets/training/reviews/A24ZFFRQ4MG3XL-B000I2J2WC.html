<meta name="summary" content="Very enjoyable :-)"></head><body><p>I really really liked this a lot.  Was it worth all the hype that surrounded it?  I don't think so, but it's as good as the book.<br /><br />When I go and see a movie, I don't go to completely analyse it.  I go to enjoy it and be entertained and enjoy the escapism that comes from the magic of movies.  I didn't sit there analysing this to the death, I just sat back and enjoyed.<br /><br />I think Ron Howard et al did a good job with it and I think all the actors did a great job in portraying their individual characters.  If you have read the book, you will find it to be just as you imagined it would.  I didn't find many differences in it and things happened just as I remembered.<br /><br />With the beautiful settings and the gripping story lines, this is a movie you'll love.  Don't read too much into it - take it for what it is; pure enjoyment and entertainment.  Go see this, you will love it.</p></body></html>

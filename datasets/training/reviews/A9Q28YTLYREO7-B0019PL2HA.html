<meta name="summary" content="just ok"></head><body><p>this film wants to be a Sattire of Southern culture in terms of the Nascar circuit. it's a goofy film with enough predictable lines&scenes that either will make you laugh a bit or just feel how dumb this film is. Will Ferrell is pretty much stuck in the same role from film to film now. Sacha Baron cohen who these days is happening in film, showcases his humor. this film has alot of cliches&alot of Product placement which after a while makes you forget about the film. there are some moments,but on a whole this film is just ok at best.</p></body></html>

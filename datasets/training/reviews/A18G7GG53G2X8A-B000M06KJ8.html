It certainly wasn't to tell a historically accurate story; despite the bold set and costume designs, the sparse moments of dialogue were completely modern, and the film's soundtrack made use of recent pop songs. That didn't really bother me, considering that many well-made period films have been very inaccurate. Maybe then the point was to portray the title character in a different light, one that would reveal how misunderstood she was in real life. If that was the intention, then something went wrong; I left the theater feeling no more enlightened than I did upon entering. Rather than delve into the complexities of Marie's mind, the film focuses on the rituals and traditions that were common in eighteenth century Europe. It was interesting, yes, but it didn't feel personal enough, and it did little if anything to help me understand the real Marie Antoinette.<br /><br />No wonder this movie is a mess; it was written and directed by Sofia Coppola, who completely missed the mark in 2003 with the grossly overrated "Lost in Translation." Both films prove that her writing style simply doesn't work (and I think it's about time someone told her so). In the case of "Marie Antoinette," we're presented with a story that goes absolutely nowhere, with each cut marking the end of yet another flat, bloodless scene. It doesn't help that half of the actors are miscast, including Rip Torn as Louis XV and Molly Shannon as a snobbish gossip-freak. Because of that, the style and emphasis they give their characters are way off track. Adding insult to injury are the film's unbearable pacing and length. I can't recall the last time I've been this bored watching a movie; I needed a jolt of caffeine by the middle just to keep from nodding off.<br /><br />And then there's Marie Antoinette herself, played with girlish innocence by Kirsten Dunst. I didn't feel as if I had the chance to explore her character fully; she felt shallow and unrefined, as if Dunst wasn't interested in the role. There's a wealth of things to see on the surface, such as laughter, tears, and the rebellious need to party and gamble in the midst of sophisticated royalty. Historically, it's easy to understand her behavior; in 1770, at the tender age of fourteen, she's arranged to marry Louis XVI, the Dauphin of France (Jason Schwartzman). This required her to leave her native Austria, not just physically, but emotionally, as well, casting aside all traces of her previous life (including her clothes, her friends, and her dog). Such a transition is understandably difficult for a teenager, considering she now has to take on responsibilities that a lot of adults aren't ready for.<br /><br />This alone was good material for to Coppola to work with, and it's a shame she used it without giving much thought to Marie. The best we're initially given is the occasional critique of how ridiculous some of the royal rituals are, such as having lower-ranking royalty dress her in the morning. We also have some tense moments between her and Louis, with the pressure to produce an heir weighing heavily upon them. But Louis is incredibly shy, pretty much to the point of ignoring her. Here's a character that didn't require a lot of effort; he's a quiet, detached young man who spends most of his time looking down. With such a passive attitude, you'd think Schwartzman could have perfected the role. He didn't. Truth be told, he completely ruined it. I've rarely seen an actor give less for a performance; he was an emotionless drone who didn't act so much as he read his lines.<br /><br />How could such a flat performance help an already weak film? The reality is that it can't. This is bad because the more serious portions of the story begin to pile up. For one thing, Marie isn't getting along with Madame du Barry (Asia Argento), Louis XV's mistress and a former prostitute. But more importantly, Marie and her husband have not been successful in the bedroom, with her attempts at initiating sexual contact flatly rejected (it's historically known that their marriage wasn't consummated for about seven years, and the audience is shown this during some incredibly repetitive scenes). Marie's mother, Maria Teresa (Marianne Faithful), is convinced that her daughter isn't "inspiring" him enough, and she continuously writes her letters of concern. Apparently, the future Queen of France can't be taken seriously unless she's pregnant.<br /><br />All of these ideas would have worked had Dunst not been directed to be so unflatteringly dull; even some elaborately shot party sequences didn't do much to enhance her screen presence. The material excess is shown to the fullest during these scenes, not the least of which come in the form of little pastries that Marie can't get enough of. She drinks champagne by the bottle. She wears dresses made of the finest materials. She even plays casino-type games with her friends, laughing the entire time. These moments are rich in visuals, yet they're completely hollow in spirit. There's no substance to what we're watching; there's only the illusion that an important story is being told.<br /><br />It isn't until the last half hour of the film that Marie becomes interesting, and by then it's too late. Such a pity: that's when she speaks a majority of her dialogue (before then, she couldn't have gotten more than ten lines in). Many years have passed and now she has children, all of whom she loves dearly (the film establishes early on how comfortable she is around children). Slowly her life comes to revolve around the need to be herself. She has her husband build her a sanctuary where she can be a mother as well as a free spirit, complete with a guesthouse, a vegetable garden, and some animals to take care of (lambs, chickens, ducks, etc.). She's the happiest during these scenes, and from the audience's point of view, she feels more like a complete character and less like a sketch. That level of complexity should have been there from the very beginning; at least then it wouldn't have been so excruciating to sit through to the end.<br /><br />And what of the end? The ultimate fate of the real Marie Antoinette is well known, but even then, I found that the final scenes of this film adaptation lacked something. Historically, we know that the people of France came to hate her for her constant spending (not helped by her husband's financial support of the American Revolution). But the film pays such little attention to this that it virtually voids the entire idea; just because Marie was sheltered from the realities of daily life didn't mean that the audience had to be. I wanted so much more from "Marie Antoinette." I wanted complexity. I wanted intensity. I wanted some kernel of knowledge about the main character to be planted in my brain. It didn't deliver; Sofia Coppola directed an empty, uninteresting film, one that is neither entertaining nor insightful. Much like the operators of the guillotine, I say off with its head.</p></body></html>

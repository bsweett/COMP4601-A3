It's not "Lord Of The Rings," of course, but it's still decent entertainment, even for us older folks. It got even better with the third installment, which has been my personal favorite of the lot.<br /><br />The special-effects are fun to watch and it was interesting to see how the three young stars - Daniel Radcliff ("Harry"), Emma Watson ("Hermione") and Rupert Grint ("Ron") have physically matured since the first movie. All of a sudden, the boys have reached puberty and their voices are changing. "Ron" squeaks half the time he talks!<br /><br />As with many modern-day, big-budget films, the visuals, the special-effects and the surround sound are all astounding. It's definitely entertaining for all ages with no worries about language, and the Blu-Ray editions eleveate this DVD another star.  The transfers on all of them, from what I've seen and read, are fantastic.</p></body></html>

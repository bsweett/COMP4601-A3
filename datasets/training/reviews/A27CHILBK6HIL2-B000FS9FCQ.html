<meta name="summary" content="A Decent Film With A Great Intellectucal Script, But It's Unfocused"></head><body><p>MOVIE: The story of V, the masked freedom fighter (or terrorist), is a dark vision of the future and how the government basically runs our lives. We have seen a recent lineup of films that take on this 1984 theme of Big Brother and we must overthrow it. If you remember the slightly enjoyable Equilibrium, and the recent Aeon Flux and Ultraviolet then you can see that this has been expressed in film already. However, with the Wachowskis helming the script we finally have a real intellectual look at the subject of a totalitarian government. The film takes place in Britain and is ruled by a dictator who is played by John Hurt (you know him as the guy from Alien who had his chest bursted open). V is the man who was betrayed and left for dead by the government and almost lost his life in a fire. Now he stands against his nation's leader by destroying government buildings and rounding up society to stand with him. He covers up his scarred body with a black caped outfit and a vaudevillian mask. Natalie Portman plays the supporting role who ends up seeing the world has V sees it. The film is very stylish and the dialogue is rich with meaning. I haven't read the graphic novel, so I cannot say if this interpretation is faithful the the comic character. But it's hard to find whose vision is being represented in the film, and that kind of makes the film a little unfocused at times. You have the original source material by Alan Moore and David Lloyd, the screenplay by the Wachowski's, and first time director James McTeigue. McTeigue was First Assistant Director on all three Matrix films, so it looks as if he is just being largely influenced by the Wachowski's. It basically feels like there are 5 directors, and not one straight vision. Hugo Weaving seals the movie with his sophisticated voice and really gives the character a reason for his motivation. It's an overall entertaining film with lots of ideas being expressed. The only thing is that these ideas have been expressed many times already in a variety of similar films.<br /><br />ACTING: Hugo Weaving (known as Agent Smith in the Matrix films) plays V, and he does a fantastic job even though we never see his face. He expresses his character's emotion through voice, and his voice is a perfect fit for the character. Natalie Portman basically becomes V's back support, and becomes more attracted to him and his goals throughout the film. She goes through a rebirth and sees the government the way V does, and basically fights alongside him. I have to mention though that her British accent was quite weak. John Hurt does a satisfactory job as the angry dictator. The cast does a fine job, but no standout performances.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: How does one man secretly manufacture and ship vaudevillian masks, black capes, and black hats to the entire population of England while the country is under a dicatorship and everything is run by the government? I don't know, but if you can get past some illogical plot holes and a familiar plot; the film itself is entertaining and enjoyable. It's well done, but it has inconsistant direction. There are more pros than cons about the film, and it's worth seeing.</p></body></html>

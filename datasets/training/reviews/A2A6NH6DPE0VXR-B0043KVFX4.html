I'm sure Ebert & Roeper still would've ripped it apart but really not that bad at all. Alice (Milla Jovovich) is back and is one of the only living humans on earth. Everything is deserts now and of course there's tons and tons of zombies around. Alice and a group of other survivors led by Claire (Ali Larter of Heroes) and Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr of the Mummy movies) fight to survive.<br /><br />  While underground scientists experiment and make clones of Alice for reasons I'm still not sure of lol. I'm not sure why the Statue of Liberty and eiffel tower are in Las Vegas in the film either unless there's replicars of them there that are unknown to me. Still though this is an enjoyable B-movie and Milla Jovovich and Ali Larter are both good at being tough chicks. Ali Larter has especially been in good Sarah Connor form since Heroes. She's actually pretty good as a tough chick in Heroes and here as well. This still isn't a fantastic movie but it's superior to the last two and if you expect an awful movie you might be surprised by it.</p></body></html>

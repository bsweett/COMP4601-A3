<meta name="summary" content=""We Patterned Our Entire Culture Upon The Historic Documents You Sent Us.""></head><body><p>Take one short-run imaginative but low-budget sci-fi TV show from the '60s that has developed a huge but geeky fan base since its cancellation and a race of innocent hero-worshipping cephalopod aliens called Thermians, who think that the random electromagnetic leakage of episodes through Earth's atmosphere are "historical documents" beamed at them for the purpose of remaking their own culture, add an ALIEN-like genocidal alien named Saris dedicated to destroying the Thermians, toss in Tim Allen of HOME IMPROVEMENT, Sigourney Weaver (a VERY busty Sigourney Weaver), Alan Rickman of DIE HARD, Tony Shaloub of WINGS and MONK, and blend---<br /><br />You get not STAR TREK, but GALAXY QUEST, an affectionate and never patronizing comedic send-up of every Boomer's once-favorite Live Long and Prosper space soap, in which the sick-to-death-of-being-typecast cast are suddenly recast as true heroes after they are hijacked from a fan convention in order to save the galaxy.<br /><br />Laughter is not just an option, it's the only option. To enjoy GALAXY QUEST it isn't necessary to be a STAR TREK fan (the film is funny on its own terms), but the in-jokes are far more pungent if the viewer is or ever was, a fan:<br /><br />Allen plays the overdramatic and occasionally bare-chested Captain who veers between heroics and bemusement, fistfights good guys and bad guys both, seduces any available female, falls down an air duct with Weaver ("Why is it always an air duct?"), and somehow avoids being mashed in an antigravity pile driver of some sort.<br /><br />Weaver's cleavage-ridden female Deck Officer, Lt. Tawny Madison, is an homage to Grace Lee Whitney and every other pretty actress who was forced to pour herself into one of Gene Roddenberry's micro-mini maxi-mammary female crew costumes.<br /><br />Rickman's frustrated Shakespearean-actor-turned-crest-headed-Second Officer will be instantly recognizable, as will the dysfunctional matter transformer that reassembles lifeforms inside out so that they explode. The ship's secret weapon is something or other called Omega-13 (isn't that a vitamin pill?)<br /><br />The obligatory nameless crewman who dies before the intro sequence is there, and as forgettable as always, though he does refuse to do random thises and thats along the way, because, he is, after all, "gonna die" if he does anything.<br /><br />Shaloub, plays the Engineering Officer, but as the actor who plays the Engineering Officer he can't manage to sharpen a pencil without spraining his wrist: "I am not that guy!" He does successfully fall in love with a Thermian.<br /><br />Add to this the cast's constant collapsing of the fourth wall as they remember it's all a show---"Didn't we do this in Episode 16?" "There is no solution? Right?"<br /><br />A certain brand of self-serious Trekkie/Trekkers will probably not laugh at GALAXY QUEST, but since such individuals are usually too busy circling Uranus to get a life, they should be sent to that Convention Hall with padded walls, and left there to beam themselves up.<br /><br />For the rest of us, GALAXY QUEST is a charming parodious visit to that old familiar strange new world and new civilization we all know and love.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""You've got to keep your mind wide open--believe in what you see.""></head><body><p>I never had the opportunity to read Katherine Paterson's Newberry Award winning children's book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0064401847">Bridge to Terabithia</a>" because I was in college by the time it was published, and for some reason that is completely lost in the mists of the past I actually had in my mind that it was a story about the Holocaust, or at least set in Eastern Europe.  But if I have had the wrong idea about the story for the past several decades the trailers that were put out for this film version only served to supplant my original erronous idea with a different ones.  The trailers made me think that I was going to watch something akin to "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8M0VA">The Chronicles of Narnia - The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a>," but of course now that I have seen this 2007 film the obvious point of reference is "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JPA6">Pan's Labyrinth</a>".  Obviously I am not the only one to notice the quantum gap between what we saw in the trailer and what we got in the film, but I have seen my fair share of stupid ad campaigns for pretty good movies and in the final analysis that is what this film is, so forget the stupid trailers.<br /><br />"Bridge to Terabithia" is not a special effects movie but a movie about a special friendship.  Jesse Arons (Josh Hutcherson, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DBHX4M">Zathura</a>") is taunted, teased, and bullied at school and takes refuge in his drawing, but his family is oblivious to his artistic talents.  Then Leslie (AnnaSophia Robb, "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009NZ2KG">Because of Winn-Dixie</a>") walks into his life as the new girl in class.  As extroverted as Jess is introverted, Leslie turns out to be a kindred spirit whose talent is for writing.  At first Jess treats her as horribly as everybody else as the new girl assumes the spot at the bottom of the school's pecking order.  But they have too much in common and they become friends, doing everything together, including exploring the woods and finding the special place she named Terabithia where parents and chores, bullies and kid sisters, can be left behind.<br /><br />There is no need to say more because you deserve to discover how this one plays out for yourself.  The cast features Robert Patrick as Jesse's overworked father and Zooey Deschanel as the kid's music teacher, Ms. Edmonds, but this film favors the kids over the adults while making it clear they live in the real world, even with the wonders of Terabithia.  I especially like the way the plotline regarding the schoolyard bully, Janice Avery (Lauren Clinton), plays out, even more than what Josh and Leslie come up with for Gary Fulcher (Elliot Lawless) and Scott Hoager (Cameron Wakefield) in Terabithia.  My understanding is that the screenplay by David L. Paterson and Jeff Stockwell is quite faithful to the book, although obviously those who have read it would know far better than me.  But at least now I know what the book is about and why it is one of the most beloved children's books of the last thirty years.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Basic Noir"></head><body><p>If you like films noirs, you'll probably like this.  It has all of the standard features--guys who wear big hats and their pants high, cops who call women "dolls" and "broads" and lots of cigarette smoking.  I like all that and love New York so I find this entertaining.  The plot is pretty good, the cast is excellent and then there's the enduring theme song.<br /><br />I found it better than many others of this genre but not as good as others.  I think it is an enjoyable period piece but it's not going to keep you awake at night thinking about it.</p></body></html>

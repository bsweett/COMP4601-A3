<meta name="summary" content="SLAM BANG POPCORN MOVIE"></head><body><p>In making his big film debut, director J.J. Abrams (LOST) certainly knows how to deliver bone-crunching action sequences, particularly the stunning attack on the bridge.  Tom Cruise's franchise, however, may be tired and Cruise himself has said there'll be no more impossible missions.<br /><br />You gotta hand it to Cruise---while this is certainly not the kind of role to win Oscars, his Ethan Hunt is a dashing, credible hero.  This time around he's married the lovely Michelle Monaghan, who is kidnapped by a crazed arms dealer, played with cool abandon by Oscar winner Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  Again, not Oscar caliber, but Hoffman's understated villainy is quite chilling.  The supporting cast of Ving Rhames, Maggie O, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Laurence Fishburne and Kerri Russell are also top notch...the camera work is great and the Lalo Schifrin theme still packs its punch.<br /><br />All in all, a good action movie and if it's the last, it's a good way to wrap it up.</p></body></html>

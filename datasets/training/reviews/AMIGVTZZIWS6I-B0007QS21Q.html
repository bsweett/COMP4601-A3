<meta name="summary" content="On Its Own Merits, A Very Good Movie"></head><body><p>First, if you're looking for a faithful adaptation of Isaac Asimov's story, then you will be very disappointed.  Calling this movie "inspired by" Asimov's story is being nice. So avoid it if you're one of those people who must see a word-for-word adaptation to enjoy the movie.  That being sad, on its own merits this is a very good movie and it's not just some summer movie blockbuster.  Will Smith is, as usual, very good.  The robot special effects are out of sight.  The action is non stop.  And the story they cobble together from Asimov's ideas is actually quite good.  There were moments in this movie that were quite touching and very dramatic.  Take this movie on its own merits and you will enjoy it.</p></body></html>

This Oscar-nominated animated film despite its rather ghoulish scenario is quite fun for the whole family.  The story deals with the prearranged wedding of Victor and Victoria, a winsome young couple who have no idea of what to expect; each family thinks the marriage will solve their financial woes; little do they realize they're both destitute.  Bumbling Victor, unable to remember his wedding vows at the rehearsal wanders into the forest and unwittingly marries Emily, the corpse bride.  Should Victor stay in this strange underworld of the dead, or should he try and get back to the living and prevent the marriage of Victoria to a scheming count?<br /><br />Burton deftly uses a dark image of the living world that is abruptly the opposite of the colorful world of the dead.  Danny Elfman's songs and score are perfect and Burton utilizes a talented voice cast including Johnny Depp, Emily Watson, Helena Bonham Carter, and Albert Finney.  There are some dazzling images and the "go action" animation is quite inventive.  All in all, while not a classic film, CORPSE BRIDE is an entertaining 77 minutes.</p></body></html>

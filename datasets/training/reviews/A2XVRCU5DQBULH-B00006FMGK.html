<meta name="summary" content="Great final chapter in the TNG story..."></head><body><p>It had to happen sometime. Picard and crew had to engage for the last time. And they do in "Star Trek: Nemesis," a good, but not perfect 10th entry in the "Star Trek" movie series. Director Stuart Baird (Executive Decision) keeps a dark, violent tone throughout the film, a welcome element after the decidedly too cheery "Star Trek: Insurrection." The story is about the Romulans being taken over by an evil human-reman experiment, Shinzon, who happens to be a clone of Picard. Soon it is discovered that Shinzon hopes to take over the Romulan and Human races and probably rule the galaxy. That is, if the only man who knows him best can stop him: Picard. There is tons of action and the best special effects in the series. Shinzon is a great villain and is almost up there with Khan and General Chang. The movie isn't quite as good as the other even-numbered Treks, but it's definitely better than the odd-numberes ones (for those who don't know, the even-numbered Trek movies are usually better than the odd-numbered ones). "Star Trek: Nemesis" is very good, and a worthy final chapter in the TNG lineage. It's a must for all Trekkies.</p></body></html>

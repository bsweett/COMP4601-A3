<meta name="summary" content="EARTHBOUND GHOSTS AND AN EVIL ROOM MAKE FOR A GOOD FILM!"></head><body><p>horror movies are my cup of tea, and this one was just another to satisfy my cravings. of course there are many ways to describe "horror" movies. you have some mystery, some gorefest, some for the mind, and some funny. it all depends on what you like. theres plenty to choose from. well this is one of the good ones for me. it's a bit creepy, a bit spooky, and some psychological stuff. well alot of it. this guy whos never been scared ends up getting the worst scare of his life, and his life is just hanging in the balance. he's lived through a tough ordeal, and now although he doesn't know it he goes into this hotel room 1408, and it just doesn't get any easier. very paced and well thought out. it's not about ghosts jumping out of the closet, or the boogeyman under the bed, or anybodies guts hanging out. it's about all your worst nightmares all in one coming at you. can you survive. there's only one way to get out. just kill yourself any way you'd like. nicely done, and stephen king succeeds once again. brilliant man. john cusack one of the good actors. he does it the way he should. his performance is one of his best. as for samuel l. jackson, the man is great. usually his roles are brief, but play an important role, that you don't forget. the movie as a whole could have been better, but i guess they all can. great mind, good movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Ok Remake!""></head><body><p>Tom Welling, Selma Blair and Maggie Grace star<br />in this 2005 horror remake of John Carpenter's<br />1980 film. A town is haunted by a mysterious<br />fog with vengeful ghosts on it's 100th birthday.<br />This is ok, but the original is better. This dvd<br />has nice picture and sound plus neat extras.<br />I still recommend this.</p></body></html>

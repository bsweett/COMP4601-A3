Sleepy Hollow is a spooky adaptation of the story of Sleepy Hollow and the headless horseman. Depp plays the skeptical city police inspector who comes to the small town of Sleepy Hollow only to be bewitched by the young Christina Ricci and to fall prey to the spells and superstitions of the town. Positively horrifying is Christopher Walken (you watch it and you will know what I am talking about. The guy is scary when you see him looking normally; this is just abuse for the eyes!) The story is well-told, acting is good, and the cinematography and scenery evokes the kind of imagery that is necessary for this to be believable. Overall a fantastic film (in the sense that it is successful in the realm of fantasy).</p></body></html>

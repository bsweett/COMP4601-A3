<meta name="summary" content="CHEECH AND CHONG FOR 21st CENTURY?"></head><body><p>"Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle" is a loosey goosey, sometimes clever, pothead quest by two non-white buds with the munchies who set out to get burgers at White Castle.  Naturally, they get sidetracked along the way with all kinds of characters and dilemmas. Uptight Harold (John Cho) and  happy-go-lucky Kumar (Kal Penn) are a Cheech and Chong for the 21st Century.  Kind of crude but the guys are easy to like and work very well off each other.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Really good film, but "best picture"?"></head><body><p>To be honest, I never really cared too terribly for most of the films that have been awarded "best picture" by the Academy (there are some exceptions).<br /><br />While "Slumdog" does rate very high in my own personal "academy", I really don't feel that it deserved the best picture award. Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, but I did find some of it's premises to be strectching it in terms of reality and believability.<br /><br />The acting, by all players young, old and not-so-old, is highly commendable, especially some of the younger talent, which I have learned had little to no acting experience. The story, although a little too unrealistic in some parts, is well-written and told with a sort-of "flashback" methodology which I found to be different and refreshing. The ending, although a bit sappy, is uplifting. I was sooooo thankful that they saved the big "dance number" for the credits (I know it's the "in" thing to do in Bollywood, but in this film it would have seemed completely silly and ruined the feel of the whole thing).<br /><br />All in all, a VERY good film, but to me, it shouldn't have been picture of the year. My personal vote was for "Gran Torino".<br /><br />There is a bit of violence (some graphic, some not so much) and just a smattering of foul language, but because of the overall adult theme of the show, I recommend you keep the kiddies away.</p></body></html>

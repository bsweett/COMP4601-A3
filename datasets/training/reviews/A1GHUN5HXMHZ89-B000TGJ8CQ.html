Cage plays a magician with a Vegas act that gets noticed by a government agent played by Moore. She wants him to find a bomb terrorists have planted. Now it sounds predictable and it is to some degree. However; I was never bored or felt the story was out of line. Overall a reasonably entertaining SciFi movie. I recommend renting before buying. I think it is replayable.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Disturbing Character Study"></head><body><p>It is amazing to me that director Christopher Nolan, fresh from directing stars Christian Bale and Michael Caine in the incredible movie "Batman Begins," is able to turn the quest for a magic trick into a two-hour movie.  Even more amazing is that even in the slow spots this movie pulls you into the complexity of the relationship between two rival magicians.<br /><br />Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale) are magicians working together, until a terrible tragedy on stage drives the two men apart and into rivalry.  Angier is the better showman.  Borden is the better magician.  Each magician attempts to alternately outperform and sabotage the other.  Each magician routinely finds ways to steal the other's tricks.  Borden particularly becomes adept at humiliating Angier.  Borden's ultimate trick, the Transporting Man, is particularly clever and makes Borden a lasting success.<br /><br />Angier tries, unsuccessfully, to learn how Borden does the Transporting Man.  Angier then travels to meet electricity wizard Nikola Tesla (singer and actor David Bowie) in Colorado.  Angier believes that Tesla has the technology it takes to make the Transporting Man work, for real.  It is at this point that the science fiction nature of this movie appears.  As an aside, Tesla's lab did not burn as shown in the movie.  Debt collectors dismantled and sold Tesla's Colorado Springs lab to pay his debts.<br /><br />Angier's return to London is phenomenally successful, sparking the rivalry with Borden anew.  However, the rivalry has acquired a sinister element, one that will bode no good for either man.<br /><br />Hollywood rarely attempts movies of this type because they are so difficult to pull off successfully.  Neither Angier nor Borden is particularly sympathetic.  In fact, the movie only works because Angier and Borden are continually fighting with each other in some form.  Rather than taking the easy way out, director Nolan uses the steady, deliberate pace of this movie to establish the mood and style of the story.  There is some action in this movie, but that is not the point of the story; atmosphere and slowly revealed horror are.<br /><br />In an era where movies vie for attention with non-stop special effects and action, "The Prestige" makes effective use of lighting and sets to give this movie a moody Victorian feel.  The special effects that are used evoke Jules Verne or H.G. Wells.  The equipment we see in this movie was very similar to that built and demonstrated by Nikola Tesla.<br /><br />"The Prestige" is a nicely directed and produced movie that combines proven movie-making techniques with modern special effects.  The result is a unique movie that will appeal to viewers that appreciate story and characters over action and special effects.  The final science fiction twist provides a disturbing chill even to those who had a suspicion as to how the movie ends.<br /><br />The generally unlikable principal characters, the slow pace, the lack of action, should have spelled box office doom for this movie.  However, viewers got the point and made this well-executed movie a success.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></body></html>

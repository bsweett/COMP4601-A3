<meta name="summary" content="ULTIMATE WAKING DREAM IN IMAX 3D"></head><body><p>I have seen the future of movies.<br /><br />As of this writing, "The Incredibles" is getting all the attention and box office bucks, but if you want to experience a jaw-dropping, eye-popping, wondrous and magical experience, please, please do not hesitate to see this film in 3D on the biggest Imax screen you an find.<br /><br />There's no doubt in my mind that this awesomely beautiful, painterly, digital creation was designed for 3D.  When you put on your polarizing 3D glasses (no red/blue lenses) and the movie starts with the 3D Castle Rock logo, you will be transported to another time and place. And not only that, the incredible feeling of transcendant magic that you always hope will happen in movies but seldom does will stay with you for the duration of this truly amazing film. And hours afterward...<br /><br />Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks had a vision for something that we have never seen before and they delivered.  It's not just the idea but the extraordinary execution. If Chris Van Allsburg's illustrated but static story is simple, the seductive power of the expanded, detailed, moving images is huge.  And the theme about Doubt and the Gift of Believing in what seems too good to be true IS of course the heart of the Christmas story.<br /><br />Other reviewers (jealous gremlins from Pixar?) have mentioned the animated kids look like "zombies with dead eyes."  I didn't see that at all.<br /><br />The 3D digital version is very much like Van Allsburg's illustrations.  And the powerful steam locomotive has real mass and inertia as it drives the story on its dangerous route to the North Pole and the huge, fabled city where millions of elves serve a mighty but kindly Father Christmas.  This Santa is no department store joke. (But who or what is the hobo on the train? Could he be Santa in another guise?)<br /><br />I can't wait to see it again and sit back as the huge, shimmering, crystal clear fully 3D images come to life in the space between my eyes and the screen, enveloping me in a world of wonder unlike anything I have experienced at the movies.  And the great, inventive sound mix and music score (except for one song) on the 15,000 Watt Imax true surround sound system are an aural delight that perfectly enhances the 3D visuals.<br /><br />I'm sure the 2D version looks just fine. But the real magic only happens on the big Imax screen in 3D.<br /><br />See this film and you will understand why the future of movies has arrived.  An absolute barrier has been broken where ancient art and new technology perfectly merge.  Now for certain, you can make real -- or should I say "reel"? -- anything you can dream.<br /><br />By all means jump aboard.  Take this ride and you too will go from doubt to believing -- anything is possible.</p></body></html>

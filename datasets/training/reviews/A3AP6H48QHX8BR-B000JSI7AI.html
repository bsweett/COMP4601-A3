<meta name="summary" content="Not Worth The Hype-"></head><body><p>I orginally saw this movie expecting it to live up to all the hype such as being told it was "one of the movies that will change the cinema forever." The movie itself is simplistic seen from a casual observer. You see the forbidden love/romance but, I was not convince that the love between Jack & Ennis was geniune you really see a few moments between here and there that make you feel as though they have a love connection- but the moments are so brief you cannot real see the true connection between the two.<br /><br />The movie taps into gay issues- such as hidden romance- not being able to reveal your "true self" or being misunderstood in society. For that the movie might change the cinema forever- making more movies that relate to gay romance/gay romance more accepted(because how it is NOT accepted in society in the movie).<br /><br />Ledger does an amazing job as Ennis a man torn between his own wants and what others expect of him. Both men do have families- and the beginning of both marriages seem almost like a sham or something that would have NEVER worked out regardless of how much either partner tired. The wives are portrayed as cold, non-responsive, and un-thoughtful... leading to perhaps that DIRE need Ennis & Jack have to be together and retreat to the place they intially fell in love "Brokeback Mountain."<br /><br />But, I seriously doubt that "Brokeback Mountain" will be here for generations or become the classic of this decade like "Titanic" or "Casablanca" will always live on. The truth is the movie has recieved the hype not for the movie itself but mainly the story matter- never has a gay romance movie gone mainstream or been accepted for that fact "Brokeback Mountain" will shape the history of the cinema and the United States. But, I highly doubt that future generations will look upon the movie as a "classic" but, more as a meer stepping stone in politics and society's views.<br /><br />If you don't want to see the movie for religious reasons or for personal beliefs than just don't see it- The movie will NOT convert or convince anyone to change their lifestyle or change their own views and truth is anyone who is against homo-sexuality for personal or religious reasons will NOT see the movie. All in all if you like simple romances and expect a simple movie/with simple concepts than you will enjoy this movie... hopeful this is just a drop in the bucket for future films/the country.</p></body></html>

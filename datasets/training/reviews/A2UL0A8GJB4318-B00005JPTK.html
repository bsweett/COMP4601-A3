<meta name="summary" content="Will Smith Shines in a Harrowing, if Flawed, "Legend""></head><body><p>Though it stoops for unearned sentimentality at the end, "I Am Legend," until then, is a spine-tingling vision of a future devoid of humanity.  And hope.  Will Smith turns in a landmark performance as Dr. Robert Neville, the sole survivor in a New York City decimated by a man-made plague.  During the day, Neville and his faithful dog travel the city for sustenance and spiritual survival.  The images of a downtown Manhattan crumbling and decaying are downright chilling.  But in the dark corners await bloodthirsty monsters that were transformed by the plague from ordinary humans to something more primitive, feral and terrifying.  Director Francis Lawrence (Constantine) and gifted cinematographer Andrew Lesnie (The Lord of the Rings) construct nerve-frying, blood-freezing sequences in an abandoned building and a New York seaport at night when Neville finds himself face to face with the cannibalistic creatures.  But Neville's true fight is not with them or with the disease he so fervently tries to cure; it's with his own dissipating sanity.  Where the film works best is when it let's Smith work his Hanksian magic, chronicling Neville's daily routine (talking to Manicheans as if they were real, waiting in seeming vain at the aforementioned seaport for any sign of life) to fight off absolute desolation.  Smith finds the ravaged, fragile soul of a man fighting for one more day, one more fleeting chance that hope will reveal itself.  When Lawrence and his screenwriters stick with this bleak, desperate story for survival, "I Am Legend" connects with unexpected emotional body blows.  The predictable deus ex machina ending blunts the emotional impact shows, but until then, "I Am Legend" is a harrowing vision of a future where hope hangs by a vulnerable thread.</p></body></html>

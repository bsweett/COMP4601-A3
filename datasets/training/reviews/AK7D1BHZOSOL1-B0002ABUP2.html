<meta name="summary" content="Goodish movie with a few points that really slow it down"></head><body><p>Dawn of the Dead movies have always been something of a guilty pleasure of mine.<br /><br />Let me just say that the 1978 version is much better but just because that is the case do not sell this one short.  The first 25 minutes or so are great the world collapses and people begin a desperate stuggle to make it however they can.  After that the movie kind of falls flat there are several reasons for this.<br /><br />1.  The lack of interesting charecters its like the world ended and only the most depressing annoying people survived.  I can honestly say that other than Steve I felt more sympathy for Andy the guy maroned in the gun store across the street than I did for any of the rest of these people.<br /><br />2.  The movie introduces certain facts and asks us to ignore them I found this to be quite a draining task.  The Zoombies are super strong and have the ability in a group to take a truck and run at super speed and some little glass is supposed to stop them?<br /><br />If the power is out at end than how does the elevator work for the gang to get down to the garage?<br /><br />Overall-The movie itself is not a total waste of time and some of the DVD features including "This just in" and "Andy's Final Days" are very interesting.  Also if you renting the DVD for the deleted parts don't bother they are really crap.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""The hopeless emptiness; Plenty of people are on to the emptiness, but it takes real guts to see the hopelessness""></head><body><p>This movie is very close to my heart, or maybe to my dark side; contemplating many subjects like boredom, high expectations, and self destruction. Based on the novel by Richard Yates; I don't believe any other two actors could've done a better job than Winslet and DeCaprio.<br /><br />Love is not the magic cure for problems; sometimes it might make problems even worse. When two people are in love and faced with life's crisis, what are they to do? What are we to do, when our minds take a life of their own and our decisions are separated from our passion, and might lead to our moral demise? Watch this movie and question the story of what is life all about, or as Yates once said: "Most human beings are inescapably alone, and therein lies their tragedy."</p></body></html>

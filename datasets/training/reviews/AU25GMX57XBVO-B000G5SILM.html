<meta name="summary" content="Not one of Michael Douglas's better movies"></head><body><p>I found, The Sentinel not very interesting and kind of boring.  The plot seemed to be attractive but for some reason just could not really get into the film.  Might be good enough to watch once for the serious Douglas fan but if you pass on it don't think your missing much.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Slow, and conveniently tied up"></head><body><p>I bought this mainly for Ben Affleck (big fan so shut up), and while he was OK, Samuel L Jackson bettered (that's bEttered, not battered) him in the better star/character stakes. I found Samuel's character and whole storyline a lot better, and more endearing to the audience.<br /><br /> This movie has been described as a 'thriller'. I'm sorry to say I have to disagree. I certainly wasn't on the edge of my seat at anytime, and found my eyes wandering to the clock a lot. It simply drags. And there are no fancy effects to talk of. So if you're looking for fancy action, or scantily clad girls - you're gonna be watching the wrong movie.<br /><br /> Sometimes, the film seems slightly rushed, even though other parts are extremely slow - the finale for example, it just seemed too convenient, that everything worked out OK (or not?), and you're left wondering where on earth Hollywood got the idea for this movie. At times, it seems like you're back in school, with two little boys in the playground accusing each other of starting it first.<br /><br /> The thing that does get me sometimes, is the fact that Samuel L Jackson seems to play the exact same role, and you can recognise the role he has played many times before. Maybe that's just me.<br /><br /> The trailer doesn't do anything for the film, the trailer seems to say it's more fast paced than it actually is. The rest of the extras are your average lot really, no bright ideas when it came to these: commentary, making-of, deleted and extended scenes, alternate endings, and &quot;A Writer's Perspective&quot; featurette.<br /><br /> You may find this movie disappointing, if you're watching it purely for Ben Affleck. Don't expect a fast paced film whatever you do. If you want a fast paced THRILLER, go for Phone Booth.</p></body></html>

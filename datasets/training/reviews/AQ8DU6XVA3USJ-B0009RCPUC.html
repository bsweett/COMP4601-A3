The last days of the Third Reich play out like a warped, insane version of Gotterdammerung, as Hitler keeps clinging to his dream of being a world conqueror. Bruno Ganz (remembered from the 1987 "Wings of Desire") is remarkable as Hitler; though there is little resemblance between them, Ganz has captured the strident voice, and the body language so well that he convinces us we are looking at the evil dictator.<br /><br />The re-creation of a war-torn, devastated Berlin is extraordinary (most of it filmed in St. Petersburg), with the fantastic cinematography of Rainer Klausmann. Meticulous attention was paid to the costuming and the props, making sure each uniform was correct, as well as the weaponry, and the furniture in the claustrophobic bunker. Based on "Inside Hitler's Bunker" by Joachim Fest, and "Until the Final Hour" by Traudi Junge and Melissa Muller, much of the film is seen through Junge's eyes, as she was hired as Hitler's secretary in 1942 and stayed with him through April '45. Fortunately for the director, many of the people depicted in this film, if they were not sentenced to death by the Nuremberg Trials, and survived the Soviet prison camps, lived very long lives, and were able to talk of their experiences.<br /><br />All the great performances are too numerous to mention, but standouts are Alexandra Maria Lara as Traudi Junge, Corinna Harfouch as Magda Goebbels, Juliane Kohler as Eva Braun, Ulrich Matthes as Joseph Goebbels, and in the one heroic part in the film, Christian Berkel shines as Dr. Ernst-Gunter Schenck. A surprising character in the last desperate days underground is Hanna Reich (Anna Thalbach), one of the most famous aviatrixes and test pilots in the world. Anyone who has seen the 1965 film "Operation Crossbow" will remember the depiction of her testing the V-1 Buzz Bomb. The only "invention" is little Peter Kranz (Donevan Gunia), who is a composite of all the children who fought in the final phases of the war.<br /><br />This is a stunning film, and needs to be seen several times, as there are quick details that are passed over in the first viewing. Not to be missed is seeing it with director Oliver Hirschbiegel's commentary, and the "Making of Downfall" Special Feature is excellent, as well as the cast interviews. An Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Film, it also has a subtle but beautiful score by Stephan Zacharias. Total running time is 156 minutes.</p></body></html>

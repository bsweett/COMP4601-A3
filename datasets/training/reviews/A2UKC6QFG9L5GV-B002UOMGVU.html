<meta name="summary" content="ONE OF THE TOP MOB MOVIES"></head><body><p>Many people argue about what's better - "Goodfellas" or "Godfather". I guess there's no point in discussing this question. Every movie is great. "Goodfellas" might not be as sophisticated as "Godfather" but it shows the dreadful reality of a criminal's life. The film is brutal, ruthless and clever. Director's work is brilliant, maybe one of the best by Scorcese, the cast is outstanding - Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Ray Liotta and many others (many of them you could later see in "The Sopranos"). Part of the film's charm is that many scenes were ad-libbed by actors as said in bonus features. You'll definately want to rewind and watch them again. What's also interesting is that the movie is based on actual events and on memoirs of the real mafioso Henry Hill (who is played by Liotta here). By the way the disc has a commentary track by Hill so you can hear how it all happened in real life.<br /><br />One of the greatest mob movies, one of the greatest movies in general. True example of a downward spiral for a man who has chosen the wrong path. Don't miss it.</p></body></html>

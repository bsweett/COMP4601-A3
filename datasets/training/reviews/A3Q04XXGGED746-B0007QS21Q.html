<meta name="summary" content="Robots Cannot Possibly Harm Humans...Or Can They?"></head><body><p>The setting of this movie is Chicago in 2035. The skyline shows the Sears Tower along with a new, taller, cone-shaped building. Cars still exist but are now largely driven automatically along the highway at great speeds. Robots do all of the menial work that humans did in the past. A robot is even shown carrying a woman's purse.<br /><br />There are three Laws of Robot Behavior, based on Isaac Asimov's ideas: 1). Robots cannot harm people nor do anything that would cause harm to humans, 2). Robots must obey all human commands, except those that would violate Law #1, and 3). Robots can protect themselves from harm, except when doing so would violate Rule #1 or Rule #2.<br /><br />This film contains profanity. There are also a few bloody scenes of a suicide or murder victim. There are graphic, creative scenes of robot combat and robotic attacks on humans.<br /><br />The investigator has doubts about the suicidal nature of the robot originator's death. The safety glass through which the victim crashed, before falling from a considerable height to his death, is very thick and not easily broken. He suspects that robots have somehow circumvented Law #1 and killed this person, but no one will believe him at first.<br /><br />It takes some time for the truth to come out. Belatedly, some humans suspect that unintended consequences in the function of the robot brain have enabled some robots to acquire the ability to disobey the Laws, and, in effect, to have a form of free will. But further investigation demonstrates that the Laws are still inviolable. It turns out that the robots had evolved their understanding of the three Laws. They now can harm individual people if it causes a benefit to the human race as a whole. In effect, the robots, aware that humans cause such things as wars, are attempting a takeover of the human race, as they are now saving the human race from itself. This is an obvious satire of human behavior.<br /><br />No human wants to be ruled by robots, even ostensibly benevolently-motivated ones. Will the robot takeover succeed? How can it even be stopped at this point? I will not spoil the ending by revealing it.</p></body></html>

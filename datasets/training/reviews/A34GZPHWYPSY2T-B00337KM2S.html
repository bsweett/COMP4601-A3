Winner of a ton of deserved Oscars, though not enough and not one for George Clooney. Clooney may be blessed--with Nick Clooney for a father, the late Jose Ferrer as an uncle, several Oscars and the shoe-in to play Cary Grant in any biopic in the works...but this film proves his luck.<br /><br />Ever been fired? I have--once--and this film begins by opening your eyes to what it is like. Several people are replying to the news that they have just been fired, one after the other, and your heart bleeds. They get angry, fall apart, whine like children. Oh yes, I recall the feeling. The humiliation, the jeers I imagined coming from all directions.<br /><br />Ryan Bingham (a radiant George Clooney) is the senior point man for the Career Transition Corporation--he flies about the nation firing people whose bosses are too scared to do it themselves. He is a proud, upright man who wants to feel for his victims--but he has no time for that. This man is a traveler, and a pro. He's like a martial artist, with every move choreographed from his tie collection with its very own leather carrying case to his Moonwalking out of his loafers at airport security. It was like watching a hilarious dance, from hotel rooms to onboard the planes.<br /><br />And he's just this side of 10 million frequent flyer miles...domestic!<br /><br />This film is, I have to say, THE most powerful statement about our economy, our national spirit and our loneliness. Woody Allen could not have made this film as good as it is. There is side-splitting repartee reminiscent of Allen's salad days; example, Bingham stewardess asks him if he'd like the cancer. The CANCER? Yes, would you like the cancer? Bingham is bewildered until the stewardess says WOULD-YOU-LIKE-THE-CAN-SIR?--referring to his beverage can. He rolls his eyes at her gross amateurism. That is how experienced he is.<br /><br />In fact the airport terminal/lounge is his home. Though a Wisconsin native, and the home office is in Omaha, Nebraska, Bingham's given up the lousy apartment he had there and simply whisks into the office and back out again.<br /><br />All that is threatened when young Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) steps in as a new hiree. She's there to computerize everything, and pull all the 'firing agents' off the road. The assassins must come in out of the cold, and Bingham does not like it. He challenges her, and soon they are on a firing trip together. They form a father-daughter type of bond, yet in the end they separate again.<br /><br />While Bingham woos his port-in-the-storm girlfriend Alex (Vera Farmiga), Natalie slowly crumbles under the weight of firing people. She simply cannot do the job. Bingham, while understanding and helpful, sees she is not right for it. In fact Bingham leaves her fairly shark-bitten when he challenges her to theoretically fire him, to prove his point.<br /><br />Ryan Bingham can manage to ferry his victims across the River Styx with gentle, professional calm. He's like a shrink, and naturally resents Natalie's psychology degree. Yet the whole idea falls through anyway, with Natalie quitting and other unexpected results. Bingham, pursuing Alex, finds her married with children. She tells him her family is everything to her...he on the other hand is nothing but company on the road. Normally we see men do that sort of thing to women!<br /><br />The cinematography is smooth and perfect, a bit 'mockumentary' at times; the soundtrack is well suited to this film. No overboard anything...but the lessons here! You MUST SEE THIS! The sadness of this film is seeing what matters (and what doesn't) to today's work force. In the end it isn't jobs: it's family. Some of the cameos here will show you what I mean.<br /><br />Bingham will learn that hard lesson but he will learn too late, as the fired individuals in a way are telling his story on certain levels. Zeitgeist isn't everything, and this film proves it. UP IN THE AIR is never patronizing, insulting or harsh. Yet it is so subtly funny you will really not know when to start/stop laughing. The "interviews" at the end, with the fired people saying their families helped them through it all, well....<br /><br />It seems the tone etc. of this film was inspired by a friend of director Jason Reitman's, who played him a song called "Up In the Air", which he wrote after getting fired. If this movie got no Oscars, all of Hollywood deserves a visit from Ryan Bingham. Certainly the two people who did NOT win an Oscar here: Clooney and the guy who wrote the original novel.<br /><br />My review seems piecemeal because, like Clooney's animated role FANTASTIC MR. FOX, this is something you have to see to believe...and enjoy like few other films you've ever seen. The really special goodies you will have to see/hear for yourself!</p></body></html>

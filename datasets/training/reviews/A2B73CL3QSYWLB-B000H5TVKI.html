He's generally dismissed as an actor and the over-inflated killing machine of "Rambo" is brought up.  People tend to forget that at the time "First Blood" came out Stallone had carved himself a nice little career as an actor.  He had the success of the first "Rocky" film under his belt, and "F.I.S.T." and "Nighthawks" were pretty good films.  "First Blood", despite the body count does have a cogent message.  John Rambo is a returning Vietnam vet who is being harrassed by the local police force in a Pacific Northwest town.  They subject him to all sorts of degradation before he finally snaps.  What the constabulary do not realize is that Rambo is no mere vagrant, that he was trained by the Marine Special Forces and that the rules of engagement are ingrained in him whether it be the bush in Vietnam or back on the homefront.  Stallone, aside from his skills as an action star, gives a sympathetic portrayal here.  The acting is generally good.  Brian Dennehy gives dimension as the sheriff that could have been one-note.  A young David Caruso appears as a deputy.  Richard Crenna's role as Colonel Trautman, Rambo's commanding officer, is a little one-dimensional.  He basically appears as kind of a Greek chorus as to the havoc that Rambo can do.</p></body></html>

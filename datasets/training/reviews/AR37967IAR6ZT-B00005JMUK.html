<meta name="summary" content="Charlize Theron, as you've heard, is amazing."></head><body><p>There is an indistinct moment during MONSTER when Charlize Theron does disappear into the role of serial killer Aileen Wuornos. You stop looking at Charlize Theron and thinking of how she transformed herself so completely. You stop watching the mannerisms she's given her character and the way she has her talk. You stop spending the film separating the actor and the role, and you just become engrossed in the film and in the flawed reasoning and psychology of a disturbed, sad killer. <p>When that happens, MONSTER begins to work really well.<p>Well-acted by Theron and Christina Ricci in the vein of MONSTER'S BALL and BOYS DON'T CRY, it's not a perfect film, but it's certainly a provocative one. You begin to actually sympathize with Wuornos and her history of abuse. Though her acts are irredeemable, several audience members did weep for her at the screening I attended. Discussions afterward were plentiful, asking questions about how much Wuornos was a creature of her environment and how much she was just a killer. It's a tremendous accomplishment that MONSTER generated that kind of response.<br /><br />The screenplay does pull some punches, though. Some of Aileen's earlier actions and statements are too contrived. The film makes one of Aileen's more sympathetic johns a stutterer so that the audience will immediately feel for him. At one point, to demonize a supporting character, the screenplay has her utter an out-of-place obscenity which leads the audience to immediately hate her. <p>On the whole, though, MONSTER is a very good film with a great performance carrying it.</p></body></html>

His handlers think he is a rogue agent and call in all "assets" to take him out. THE BOURNE IDENTITY is a classy, realistic film. By realistic, I mean not only the various sets in Paris and Switzerland and on a trawler in the Mediterranean, but the fact that Damon, when he is zapping some bad guy, usually finds himself in a hell of a fight. The bad guys are GOOD! That goes to make this a more believeable thriller than, say, MI III, where the bad guys are push overs and our hero is amazing. Damon does a great acting job as a believeably tough guy who can think fast on his feet. There is a sweet, understated love interest with Franka Potente, a fresh screen face, not too beautiful, which also lends to realism, who plays a stranger whom Damon befriends. Adapted from Robert Ludlum's novel of the same name, the screenplay is tight and keeps the viewer wondering, along with Damon, who he is and how he will survive. In essense, this is a chase-and-run flick, with the CIA (again) as the bad guys. They give a good account of themselves, however, but Damon was apparently trained to be the best. I'll take Damon to watch my back any time over Tom Cruise when things go down. Recommended highly.</p></body></html>

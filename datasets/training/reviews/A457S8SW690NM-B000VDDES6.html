<meta name="summary" content=""I love scotch.." And I love this movie!"></head><body><p>Anchorman is my kind of movie. It gives you lots of great laughs, and has a good cast and awesome cameos. The movie's about Ron Burgundy, the # 1 and beloved anchorman in San Diego. He loves his dog, women, and scotch and life is perfect for Ron. But then a woman whom he finds very attractive wants to be an anchor. Ron and co anchors are infuriated because it's a man's job and it's anchorman and not anchorwoman. Ron's obviously got some new competition on his own news station and of course also has competition with all of the other news stations. (That have lead anchors Tim Robbins, Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller) The reumble between all of the news stations a la West Side Story rocks! Ron's co anchors all also neat and funny especially Brick, a very "special" weather man. (You'll have to watch to find out)<br />The movie's plot is simple and it's quite stupid but is just absolutely hilarious. The motorcycle/ burrito scene with Jack Black is the best but this movie's got loads of laughs. If you want some good laughs in your collection, this one's a good choice. Also the special features rock with Ron Burgundy at the MTV awards, and auditioning for ESPN. And lastly, there are a lot of hilarious deleted scenes. This one's worth your money.</p></body></html>

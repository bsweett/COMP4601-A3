<meta name="summary" content="The story of a super-zero"></head><body><p>A high school nobody and comic book aficionado (Aaron Johnson) decides to become a real life superhero (despite the lack of superpowers), christens himself Kick-Ass, and promptly gets his ass kicked by a couple of street goons.  This tips us off that we are not in store for the typical superhero movie.  Displaying incredible courage-slash-unbelievable stupidity, he persists in his mission and is drawn into a war between a drug kingpin (Mark Strong) and a couple of Batman and Robin knockoffs, Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) and his daughter Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz), who is the real thing.<br /><br />Some may be put off by the violence and profanity, particularly since many of the characters are so young, so be warned: this film deserves its R rating.  If that doesn't bother you, you're in store for a very funny comedy with plenty of exuberant action scenes. Moretz steals the show and Cage is hilarious channeling Adam West while in his Big Daddy persona.  Johnson is low-key but likeable, which is just what his character requires.</p></body></html>

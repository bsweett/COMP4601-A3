<meta name="summary" content="The star of this film is the violence of an era!"></head><body><p>This historical film provides an glimpse into the violence and criminality of the late 1800's.  The plot is the revenge of the killing of Amsterdam's (di Caprio) father by The Butcher (Daniel Day Lewis) the reigning gang leader of the section of New York known as Five Points.  This is set against the backdrop of the civil war, corruption in politics and prejudice against immigrants to the US.<br /><br />While the stars do their usual good job with a wonderful supporting cast, the true star of the film is the violence of the era.  This leaves us with little to like about the film as the characters are manifestations of a culture of violence and predation. The usual themes of love, betrayal and vengeance are not enough to engage us after multiple scenes of callous violence.  The lack of emotional and spiritual depth leaves a feeling of dullness and lack of resolution at the end of the film.<br /><br />This film is mildly interesting visually but I felt more could have been done in this arena as well.  Also, there problems with pacing--it drags at points.  A flawed film and not up to the usual Scorcese standard.</p></body></html>

American Gangster had a pace that was only sometimes interesting probably because there wasn't enough action segments to keep me satisfied- just spoken bits that were never really memorable, and every time Russell Crowe spoke in his character role the quality of the storytelling felt like it slipped a little.  It's like the movie kept tricking you into thinking it would become more interesting with every new segment but never delivered.<br /><br />I realize most people who've watched American Gangster really respect it, but I can't bring myself to call this film a classic or anything- just barely good enough to keep a story flowing, and nothing more.</p></body></html>

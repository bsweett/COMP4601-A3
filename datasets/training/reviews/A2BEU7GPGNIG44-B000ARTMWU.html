<meta name="summary" content="You will want to watch it until the end!"></head><body><p>High Tension is an intense film that you will want to watch from start to finish. If you can make it through all of the blood and gore to the finish you might find yourself scratching your head due to an unexpected twist in the film.<br /><br />The film is about two college students, Maria and Alexia. Maria heads with Alexia to her home in the middle of nowhere surrounded by cornfields to study. Alexia's family is comprised of her mother, father and very young brother. High Tension was originally released in France. This movie has a lot more blood and gore than U.S. horror movies have had in the last 15 years. The first night as everyone is tucked into bed the massacre begins as the viewers watch a highway man bloody kill and torture one person after another. As the film ends it becomes baffling to even describe what happened during the course of the film. Basically, Alexia appears to be kidnapped by the highway man and Maria appears to be doing everything in her power to rescue Alexia down to being involved in a car wreck when trying to rescue Alexia from the supposed murderer/kidnapper. If you have seen the movie Identity or the movie Intensity you may notice some storyline similarities. The film is very bloody and very gory in it's unrated version. Despite the storyline that might leave you scratching your head it is an intense thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the last frame appears on the screen.</p></body></html>

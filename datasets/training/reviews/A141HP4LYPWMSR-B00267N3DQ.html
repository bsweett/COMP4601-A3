<meta name="summary" content=""With A Smile And A Song" ~ The Birth Of An American Dynasty"></head><body><p>To truly appreciate this film one should remember that `Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' was released in '37 making it's production an incredible achievement in animation considering the overall state of the art at the time. This film was the spring board for the many Disney classics to follow in the years ahead making it a classic by that standard alone.<br /><br />However having that said, after all these years the film can still stand on its own merits. The animation is enjoyable, the soundtrack is enchanting, at times haunting and the seven dwarfs are beloved by millions around the world. It may not be technically the best of Disney's animated films but it was the benchmark of all that was to follow and still has a loyal fan base after all these years. A true classic.</p></body></html>

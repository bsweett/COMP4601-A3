<meta name="summary" content="Arnold and Cameron - What A Team!"></head><body><p>Terminator is one of those movies I remember long after I walked out the theatre. What I remembered most was that it was pretty darn scary. A good thriller type of film to watch on the TV or Theatre. The effects were very cool at the time and the robot and mechanical effects were pretty impressive.<p>Of course James Cameron and Arnold Swartzeneger had a chance, with more time, money and technology, to do the second Terminator much bigger, better, faster and louder - but this one had a simple story and motivated the characters to really move.<p>Linda Hamilton and Michael Bein were great together and the action very intense. Ironically enough The Terminator is a bad guy in this movie. He spends most of his time trying to kill Linda. In the sequel, he is just the opposite - trying to save Linda and her son. It's irony with a twist.<p>This is good science fiction, with good action and some very scary scenes; I purchased this DVD, which does not have all the extras. Since then, the new DVD has a lot more. Oh and Terminator 3 will be out in 2003 - if you didn't already know!</p></body></html>

I appreciate deep films with deep characters and good writing, this film has none of those.  However, I can't say for one minute that I was not entertained.  This movie blew me away, the sound was literally a blast, and the visuals were a treat.  It is easy to tell that the director has directed many music videos.<p>You will not like this film if you are turned off by shallow stories and mindless action.  It also is an insult to anyone serious about martial arts.  If you like cheap thrills and want to have fun, I highly reccomend it.</p></body></html>

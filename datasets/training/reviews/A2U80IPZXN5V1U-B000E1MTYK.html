<meta name="summary" content="Very impressive !!!"></head><body><p>I read the books of harry potter and own em and when i read book 4 it was really an unbelivable experience it was longer but how good!The autor j.k rowling really take you and make you feel like you were in front of everything that was was happening i wasnt just reading the book i was sort of living it and every time i stopped reading it was like;oh were am i?<br /><br />And i got that same reaction with the movie the producers have done so well the harry potter universe is hard to imagine and they captured it with so much class and the actors really do well while being part of it.The characters have grown a lot since the first movie and the producers really made that hapen.<br /><br />With the harry potter movies you really felt like the books and to reproduce such a long book to a movie with the same essence its unbelivable the animation,the story ,everything here is great.They captured most of the imporant parts and cut the less important but the result is very impressive.But the movie is for older audiences then the first 3 so they rated it pg-13.<br /><br />They argue with harry potter`s lenght yes its very long about 2 hours and a half but you get so much in the movie the first 3 movies were very surprising with amazing effects but consider that each year it gets more long,more complicated than before and the 4 says it all.<br /><br />They grown the characters over the years but there is a major change here as they experiment relashionships and other things.Also the arrival of the tri wizard tournament changes things.3 Schools including hogwarts are competing and competitors must be a certain age ,and the competitors must throw their name in the cup.3 Names are chosen one from each school,but after harry`s name gets picked.<br /><br />And the story really take place itself.The story is darker than before and as voldemort`s return and the cemetary scenes proves it but it isnt an horror movie.Many events like voldemort`s sign in the sky to the other hogwart competior`s dead keep the movie nonstop action and your heart pumping.The tournaments has the 3 events like in the book in wich the 3 round the other hogwart competitor dies.<br /><br />Harry must also deals with arrogant Rita Skeeter who try to write fake news of him,like his pretended loving relationship with hermione.Hermione gets invited to the ball by proffesional quiditch player Victor Krum while Harry and Ron dont get succes with the girls.<br /><br />All that to say this movie is totaly awesome Harry Potter fan or not dont miss it really impressive had the best special effects of the 4 movies and is truly outstanding!Rent it or buy it when it comes out!Its so awesome!</p></body></html>

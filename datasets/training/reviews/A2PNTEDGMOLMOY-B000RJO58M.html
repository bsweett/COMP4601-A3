"Hot Fuzz" Rocks!"></head><body><p>Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg (director and co-writers) nailed the zombie spoof with the uber-witty "Shaun of the Dead."  Re-assembling much of the same cast and keeping the understated yet hilarious send-up theme, they turn their sights to action flicks of the Jerry Bruckheimer/Tony Scott variety with "Hot Fuzz."  And the results couldn't be better.<br /><br />Nicholas Angel (Pegg, the lead from "Shaun) is the top kick-butt sergeant in the London police force.  This is in itself high comedy, because Pegg only resembles an action hero the way Rudy represents a Notre Dame football player - I half expected someone to remind Angel that he's five-foot-nothin' and a hundred-and-nothin', with a weak chin to boot.  His success only earns him the enmity of his fellow cops (including the hilarious Bill Nighy) who reassign him to the country to keep them from looking bad.<br /><br />Once there, Angel finds a police force who couldn't assemble a two-car parade and haven't been asked to do much more than that.  Eventually, though, Angel stumbles upon a massive criminal enterprise and brings it down with the help of not-so-trusty sidekick Danny Butterman (Nick Frost, also the fat sidekick in "Shaun").<br /><br />Like "Shaun," "Hot Fuzz" has the usual combination of subtle and not-so-subtle humor wrapped around some shocking-yet-comical violence.  A larger budget means that explosions are bigger and deaths are bloodier and more elaborate, but at its heart "Hot Fuzz" remains an ingenious comedy more than an action movie.  While the movie stands on its own rights, it means a heck of a lot more if you've sat through more than your share of "Lethal Weapon" or "Bad Boyz" flicks - these guys feel your pain, too.</p></body></html>

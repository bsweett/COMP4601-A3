<meta name="summary" content="The live-action Heavy Metal!"></head><body><p>In a 23rd Century New York City, down on his luck cabdriver Korben Dallas gets the surprise of his life when the woman of his dreams suddenly crashes through the roof of his flying taxi and into his backseat. Korben is instantly caught up in an eternal and universal battle between good and evil on which the fate of the Earth all depends. Leeloo, the mysterious young woman who has fallen into Korben's life, is sought after by both forces, and it's up to him to protect her and see that she is able to carry out her secret mission. Together with the help of the government and a pair of monks, Korben and Leeloo travel to the vacation planet of Fhloston, flamboyant radio D.J. Ruby Rhod at their side. Aboard the luxurious cruise ship hotel known as "Fhloston Paradise," Korben and Leeloo battle off the attacks of hideous alien rogues and powerful businessman Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg, and meet an enthralling opera singer called Diva Plavalaguna who provides them with the four sacred stones necessary to save the Earth. Of course, the stones are useless to the heroes without the most important element to their cause, the Fifth Element.<br /><br />Bruce Willis stars as lovestruck Major turned cabdriver Korben Dallas, along with Milla Jovovich as the beautiful super-soldier believed to be the "Fifth Element." Gary Oldman is the ruthless Emanuel Zorg, Ian Holm is Father Cornelius, and Chris Tucker is the hilariously played celebrity D.J. Ruby Rhod. First-time viewers of "The Fifth Element" who are fans of the genre will likely immediately recognize similarities to the Harry Canyon sequence of the 1981 animated cult classic "Heavy Metal." In truth, the glorious visual style that epitomizes "The Fifth Element" harkens back to much of this film. This is not by accident. Writer/Director Luc Besson's inspiration for "The Fifth Element" relied greatly on the work of the French artists who created the original "Heavy Metal" magazine, whom Luc hired to help him create this masterpiece of cinematic art. That having been said, it's no wonder that "Fifth Element" will probably find its strongest fans among those who are lovers of such films as "Heavy Metal," "Rock and Rule," and other such adult sci-fi fantasies. "The Fifth Element" is a lively, colorful, exciting, hilarious, and visually stunning ride from beginning to end, telling a wild but meaningful story with fantastic characters and creatures that have to be seen to be believed. The amount of art and work that went into making this remarkable film is astonishing! The unique, lavish costumes were designed by Jean-Paul Gaultier and the music by Eric Serra is terrific!  The 2-disc Ultimate Edition DVD is beautifully presented in widescreen and contains over 120 minutes of featurettes covering the conception, effects, creatures, actors, and fashion. The DVD also offers a poster gallery, visual tests, and a feature-length trivia track in lieu of a commentary. Surprisingly, there is no theatrical trailer for the movie itself, though it does include trailers for three other films, most notably "Mirrormask." If you are at all a fan of the sci-fi, futuristic genre of films, pick up "The Fifth Element" today! McDonald's Drive-Thru attendants never looked so good!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A trilogy everyone should own."></head><body><p>Before I get to the reviews of each movie, I just want to say I think everyone should watch the special features on these discs. I dont usually watch them cause I dont have all the time in the world to do that, but there were a lot of fun to watch. And the outtakes were really funny. Glad they had those to put on these discs.<br /><br />Back to the Future: Part 1<br /><br />-Great Scott!<br /><br />In 1985, Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) asks Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), a high school teenager, to meet him at the local mall for a late night science experiment. When Marty shows up, he sees Doc backing a Delorean out from a van. But this just isn't any Delorean. This Delorean has been modified into a time machine. As Doc begins to explain how it all works, a group of terrorists that Doc stole some uranium from, show up and begin to wreak havoc. Marty jumps in the car and floors it after witnessing Doc getting shot. But as soon as Marty hits the magic number of 88mph, he is shot back in time to 1955. While trying to figure out how to get back to 1985, he screws up the first time his parents meet, which begins the slow cycle of his brother, his sister, and even himself to slowly fade away from existence. Marty must figure out a way to get the time machine to work again and also somehow get his popular mom to fall in love with is geeky father so he can get back to the future.<br /><br />Talk about a movie that just never gets old. Almost all the laughs are still funny. From the barn scene, to the first time Marty meets his mom as a teenager, to the skateboarding/poop scene. Back to the Future really is just a very fun movie. I think I was smiling almost through the whole thing and I've had to have seen this movie over 20 times by now. I think almost everyone has wished they could go back in time, but who really thinks about going back to hang with their parents. After seeing this movie, it might really be fun to do just that. We know Marty's mom preaches about how girls shouldn't chase guys and things, but when we see her at a younger age, she is doing exactly what she forbids her own children from doing. And when he comes across his dad, he finds out things that he never knew his dad was interested in. And then of course we have Doc Brown, who Christopher Lloyd played perfectly. His antics, and screams, facial expressions, and over the topness were done just right. What a great character. And Michael J. Fox also plays Marty McFly just right to. To think that Eric Stoltz almost played Marty McFly. Thankfully the director thought he just didn't fit the part and refilmed it with Fox.<br /><br />Honestly, I could go on and on and on about this movie and just tell the whole story. But what fun would that be. Just own this movie.<br /><br />P.S. - I love watching old 80's flicks and seeing all the stuff that was cool back then. Also I really like seeing old advertisements or signs. Like the Pepsi symbol back then. Classic stuff.<br /><br />-----------------------<br /><br />Back to the Future: Part 2<br /><br />-We gotta go back in time to save the future that we messed up when someone went back to the past and screwed it up. Yep.<br /><br />The day after Marty gets back from 1955, Doc leaves in the time machine to go the future to the year 2015, only to return seconds later (though much more time has passed for Doc). Something terrible happens in the future to Marty's son. Thankfully Marty and his son are the spitting image of each other so Doc has come up with a plan to have Marty take the place of his son for a few minutes to make a correct decision to prevent the bad incident from happening. But while they are in the future, the Biff we know from 1955 and 1985 overhears Marty and Doc talking about their time machine. So Biff decides to change his crappy life by stealing the time machine and going back to 1955 with a sports almanac with all the winners of every sport up to the year 2000. So when Marty and Doc make it back to 1985, it's a very different 1985 than the one that they left. After figuring out what happened, they must once again go back to 1955 to prevent the almanac from being used by Biff so they can save the future that they know. Whew.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of the second movie of the trilogy. It used to be my favorite of the trilogy. Probably because of the flying cars and the hover board. Also the more in depth time traveling was definitely nice to have, even though you had to suspend a little bit of belief of how time travel works. Because honestly if Biff goes back in time and changes time, then time should've altered while Marty and Doc were in 2015. To me, the 2015 scenes were cool, but the movie becomes a lot better when they go back to 1955 again. It was a lot of fun to see Marty watching himself do the things he was doing in the first movie. Like when you see him low crawling under a window of the car that part 1 Marty is sitting in with his teenage version of his mother from 1955. Also it was funny to see Fox play multiple characters in this movie such as his son, his older self and even his daughter from 2015. Also it was amusing to see the 2015 Biff ragging on his former 1955 self for being dumb and sounding like an idiot. And also seeing the son of Biff, Griff, was a trip too. Because he's basically the same type of bully his father was in 1955, but more juiced up because of robotic implants. It was even nice to see Zemeckis do an homage to part 1 by having almost the same skateboard scene from part 1 in this movie also, but a more futuristic version of it.<br /><br />Though it used to be my favorite of the trilogy, I'm starting to lean more to part 1 being my favorite, but part 2 is definitely a close second. Once again, this movie is a classic also and I highly recommend it if you loved part 1.<br /><br />P.S. - From the first time I saw this move to right now as I type this... I want a friggin hover board!<br /><br />-----------------------<br /><br />Back to the Future: Part 3<br /><br />-Saddle up Cowboy... it's a Wild West adventure for Doc and McFly.<br /><br />As soon as Marty and Doc get ready to go back to 1985 from 1955, the Delorean is hit with a lightning bolt and sends Doc somewhere in time. As Marty is standing there in 1955, confused on what to do, a mailman comes up to him, handing him a letter addressed to him, from 1885, from Doc. The letter says that he hid the Delorean in a cave, and to use it to get back to 1985 and to not come to 1885 to rescue him. But when Marty finds out that Doc dies from a gunshot to the back, he decides to not listen to Doc and head back to 1885 to save Doc from dying. But when he arrives in 1885, he busts his fuel line, leaking out all the fuel. And in 1885, there is no gasoline. So while Doc and Marty try to figure out how to get back to 1985, they must also try and not die by the gun of Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen, the relative of Biff.<br /><br />While part 3 feels like part 1 and 2, it almost feels totally different. It being more of a western has a big hand in that also. And I love westerns, so I love part 3. Honestly in my review of part 2, I said part 1 is probably my favorite, but I really don't know. I love all 3 parts equally because even though they all have the same premise, they are all so different at the same time. In part 3, I absolutely loved the character of Buford Tannen. He was absolutely hilarious. And he really felt like he was a bad guy from back in the west. The way he talked and the way he looked. I also liked how a lot of part 2 hinted at parts of part 3 (since they were both made back to back). For instance, Marty sees a picture of his great grandfather in part 2 and he says something like "Good looking guy", but in part 3 we find out it was really Marty himself. And definitely one of my favorite parts of all 3 movies is here in this movie. The final scene with the train trying to get the Delorean to the future was done really well.<br /><br />For the final part of the trilogy, I really couldn't have asked for more. Definitely a great ending to a great trilogy that will be loved for a long time by children and adults. OWN THIS!<br /><br />P.S. - So why didn't Marty and Doc just go to the cave that Doc put the Delorean in to siphon gas from it to put it into the Delorean that needed gas instead of trying to use a train to get it to the future. DOH! =)</p></body></html>

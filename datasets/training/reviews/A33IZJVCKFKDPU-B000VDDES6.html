<meta name="summary" content="Not as funny as it could have been"></head><body><p>Will Ferrell is probably the hottest and most in demand comedian in movies right now and deservingly of course.  He is an amazingly funny person.  He just sends of that impression of being an old creepy guy that uses stupid pick-up lines on girls and tries to hang out with the younger crowd.  Almost anything that he does turns out funny.  Well, except for this movie.  <p>Anchorman is about a new anchorman named Ron Burgundy (Ferrell).  His station is the number 1 rated news broadcast in the San Diego area.  Ron Burgundy is a sexist, extremely cocky person who is always trying to hook up with girls by saying "You know, I am famous."  Along with the rest of his news team, all of them being male, they strut around town and are well known by everyone.  Well, the management at Channel 4, Ron's station, decides that they need a change and hire a female news reporter.  This does not sit well with Ron and the rest of the news team.  So after a brief relationship with the new female broadcaster (Christina Applegate), Ron decides to try to destroy her career.  This backfires against him and he becomes scum and then rises back to the top.  Enough said.<p>Now don't get me wrong, this movie had its funny moments.  The cameos by Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, and Jack Black (whose cameo turned out to be the funniest moment of the movie) were really good.  Steve Carrell was the funniest of Burgundy's news team.  The problem is that the movie felt like a really long SNL skit that started to get old after about 20 minutes.  During most of the movie, the audience was not laughing.  The movie had a lot of dry parts and moved at a much slower pace then, say, Dodgeball.  This wasen't a bad movie, its just wasen't what I was hoping for.</p></body></html>

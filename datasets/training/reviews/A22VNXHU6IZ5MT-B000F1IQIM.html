<meta name="summary" content="Good not great!!!"></head><body><p>This film is good, not great. Get me wrong I DID like this film but's just not as good as El Maricahi or Desparado. Johnny Depp is definatly the best thing about this one!!!Antonio Banderas is also good in his reprising role. It's got a great supportin  cast(Including Cheech Marin,Mickey Rourke,and Willen Dafoe),but what really disappointed me was that Selma Hayek was in it very too briefly!!! But it's got oodles of action!!! It reminds me a lot the Godfather Trilogy were 1 and 2 are masterpieces and 3 is not!!! It just seemed totally different than the other two!!!But overall an O.K. movie!!! 3 stars for this one!!!</p></body></html>

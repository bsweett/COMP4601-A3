<meta name="summary" content="Tour de Force.  But for the ending, a 5."></head><body><p>It's easy to get numbed by the movies that dominate the theaters. Those that are entertaining, tend to be mildly so.  Those that have even slightest provocative content ordinarily end in silliness, or, worse yet, overwrought self-parody.  But when I was least expecting it, 28 Days Later hit me like a baseball bat across the side of the head.  Except for an ending that seemed tacked on and unnecessary (I would have much preferred an ending where there is dramatic freeze frame--you'll know it when you see it--about 5 to 10 minutes before the real ending), this is film that is a wonder of excellent acting, fine storytelling, and profound intellectual metaphor.  And it couldn't be more timely with the media echoing with tales of super-bugs, monkey pox, ebola, and SARS.  But this movie isn't about a virus, it's about human nature.  About who and what we really are.  And how quickly that true nature could be revealed if a thread-bare social structure were to unravel for ANY reason.<p>You should simply watch this movie.  Pay attention to the low-budget artistry that abounds (it is pitch perfect), the gorgeous cinematography, and the sets.  And to who the real monsters are.  I kept thinking about the riots in this country, and how they reveal something about how close we are to being brutal animals--and that we do a great job of tricking ourselves into believing that we're more than acquisitive brutes.  Keep hope alive, I suppose.</p></body></html>

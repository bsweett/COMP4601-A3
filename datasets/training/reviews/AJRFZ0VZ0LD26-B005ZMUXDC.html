<meta name="summary" content="Fun Disney movie with less singing"></head><body><p>I saw this movie during Christmas holidays.  It was my first time to spend holiday with young children around.  Family had to pick a movie that will be fun, entertaining and engaging.  I was dreading the thought of having to watch another "sing and dance" movie with endless catchy songs.<br /><br />This film turned out to be fun.  It has lovely story line from one of the fairy tales and plenty of action.  It is great for both boys and girls.  Adults will not be left behind, they will enjoy this film just as much.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Don't get trapped in the men's bathroom."></head><body><p>The DVD disc of SAW has a round saw on the label.<br />  Kidnapped and instantly a victim, similar to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305238065">Cube</a> (1998), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008DDVY">Cube 2 - Hypercube</a>(2002), Adam (Leigh Whannell) had just gone to bed. When he awakens, he finds himself submerged into a water-filled bathtub.  He gets out and finds another man, Lawerence (Cary Elwes, Twister [1996]) also in this unclean bathroom.  Lawerence is chained to a pipe too.  A third man has been killed and is lying on the floor.  The men don't remember how they got there.  They discover each has an envelope in their pocket with their name on it.  Inside the envelope is a mini-tape labeled "play me", a bullet and a small key.<br />  They manage to get the tape recorder away from the dead man.  The message for Adam is, "Are you going to watch yourself die, Adam, or do something about it".  Lawrence's message is that he must kill Adam by 6:00am or his wife and child will die and he will be left to rot in this bathroom.<br />  This industrial bathroom contains many more clues for the men.  The small key does not unlock the chains their foot is trapped in, so they must find a way to survive this thing before 6:00am.  They must also find an "X" that marks the spot.<br />  Cast also includes: Tobin Bell, Danny Glover, Ken Leung (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005UW7V">A.I. - Artificial Intelligence (Full Screen Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> [2001]), Dina Meyer, Benito Martinez ( <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009JVUHY">Million Dollar Baby (Full Screen Edition)</a> [2004]), Shawnee Smith (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005N5RM">The Blob</a> [1988]) and Makenzie Vega.<br />  DVD includes a 2 1/2 minute featurette of the making of SAW.

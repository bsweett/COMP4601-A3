<meta name="summary" content="I Appreciated and Enjoyed, But My Young Kids Were Bored"></head><body><p>This is a beautiful, masterful movie, as one would only expect from Scoresese, and I thoroughly appreciated its artistry, and enjoyed watching it. My kids however, ages 5 and 7, were a bit young for it, and found it slow. The shots in old Paris are lovely, and the train station setting is wonderful and allows for some amazing shots, especially as the young Hugo works inside the clocks, and the trains race through the stations. Orphan Hugo works with a friend to discover the trick to getting an old automaton his father left him to work, and ends up discovering the world of early film making. This movie basically offers a brief history of film, with footage from pre-war movies both real and created, and I loved this. It does verge on sentimentality though, and wasn't nearly as fascinating to my kids. For all the talk of movies being like dreams, I thought this could have used a little more of a nod to modern-day special effects, beyond some of the train scenes, to capture the youth of today. Other than that though, this is a wonderful film with a warm heart, and safe family fare.</p></body></html>

The gauzy, sepia-toned computo-cinematography is equal parts Fritz Lang's Metropolis and cheesy sci-fi serialization.  It's thrilling to look at for the first few minutes, but once the torpor of the film becomes apparent, nothing really makes much of an impression.  It seems as if the stars -- Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow -- were instructed to behave as if they were actors in a low-budget '30s action serial, ie., to emote flatly and have delayed or muted reactions to any and all plot developments.  This, combined with the actual challenge of acting against a blue screen (where the actor is told what special effects will be doing, but can't actually see what will be onscreen in final print...), essentially sinks the film.  Overall, the movie is just plain unexciting -- the pacing is slow, the special effects are also held in check, presumably to mimic the stiff, ricketty charm of the serials.  Thus, robots clank past clumsily, stone walls fall to the ground as if made of molasses, airplanes move with mechanical deliberation... Why the director didn't just digitize in some fake "wires" to hold the models up is, honestly, a bit of a mystery to me.  The film is full of clever homages to classic films -- The Wizard Of Oz, Lost Horizon, every "girl reporter" film known to mankind, etc. -- but although it's clearly a labor of love on the part of director Kerry Conran, Sky Captain is essentially dull as dishwater.  It's a pity.  If they had injected just a modicum of excitment into the proceedings, this could have been a wonderful film.</p></body></html>

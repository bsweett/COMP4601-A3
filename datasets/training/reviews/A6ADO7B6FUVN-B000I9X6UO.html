<meta name="summary" content="Breathtaking Cinematic Experience..."></head><body><p>Phone Booth is projected with a real time sensation that offers thrills, and mind boggling situations and dialogues.  Stu (Colin Farrell) works in public relations and he is about to call his girlfriend through a pay phone.  On this occasion the pay phone rings and Stu answers.  There is a voice that says that he will be killed if he hangs up, which is proven through a small red laser pointer on his chest.  The caller is not ready to reveal why he called Stu, because the caller wants to play a little game before he tells Stu the truth.  The story is short, yet it is psychologically loaded with threats that keep the audience on the line ready for anything to happen.  Phone Booth offers a breathtaking cinematic experience.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Return ... Super ... Ah ... make up your own snappy title here"></head><body><p>Finally, a return not only of the man of steel, but of movie makers who know what makes a superman movie great. No more billionaire Luthor wannabes. No more lame solar-powered superman clones. No more women getting inexplicably assimilated with silver circuit boards all over their faces. This is just a good-old-fashioned Superman adventure with a little humor, a little sexual tension and a whole lot of Superman doing what he does best.<br /><br />Admittedly, it is a bit heavy on the soap opera at times, but that is mainly because they have to be sure to re-introduce the characters to a movie-going audience that hasn't seen them on the big screen in 19 years. And not in a *good* movie for 26. But even with the soap-opera aspects present, this is a great follow-up to the first two movies, conveniently pretending that Supermans III and IV never happened. (As do many of the fans.)<br /><br />Spacey is wonderful as Lex Luthor. Gene Hackman played up Luthor's charisma and self-importance superbly. Spacey, however, creates a Luthor that can truly scare you with a glance.<br /><br />Superb movie, and I can't wait for the follow-up.</p></body></html>

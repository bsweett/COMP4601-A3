<meta name="summary" content="Beware of the quiet ones"></head><body><p>Robin Williams adroitly plays Sy Parrish, a quiet, lonely, laid back yet marginally sociopathic photo film developer in the smoldering thriller One Hour Photo.  Williams is obsessed with a young family with Connie Nielsen playing the mother, who are frequent customers in his Savemart store.  He is enamored with Nielsen's young son imagining himself to be part of the family.  We learn that this is in response to Williams own wretched childhood.<p>When Williams developes a roll of film belonging to an attractive young lady he detects the family's father played by Michael Vartan, having an affair with the gal.  Williams though devastated decides to take matters into his own hands.<p>One Hour Photo plays like a symphony, starting slowly and building to a crescendo which is quite disturbing.  Williams was excellent in his role.</p></body></html>

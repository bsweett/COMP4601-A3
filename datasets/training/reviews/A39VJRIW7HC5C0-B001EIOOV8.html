<meta name="summary" content="Up there with Goodfellas"></head><body><p>Although rarely considered as good a movie, Casino is a brilliant piece of filmaking that is as good in many ways as Scorsese's earlier Mafia film Goodfellas.<br /><br />Starring Robert DeNiro as a career gambler who is very good at what he does, Joe Pesci as a his volatile "muscle" friend, and Sharon Stone as a high priced call girl and DeNiro's eventual wife, Casino is a whirlwind of stories and situations, sometimes gruesome and sometimes hilarious.  DeNiro is given a Casino to run in order to keep a steady supply of funds going "back home" to the mob bosses in Kansas City.  However, DeNiro's desire to stay straight (he's so good at what he does he feels he doesn't need Mob protection) puts him at odds with childhood friend Pesci, who is attempting to rule Las Vegas.  Then everything begins to tumble...<br /><br />An unrelenting and brutal film, hampered only slightly by the addition of James Woods as a sleazy lowlife.  However, the acting is superlative all around (Stone was nominated for an oscar) and Scorsese's always solid direction make this a movie to see.  9.5/10</p></body></html>

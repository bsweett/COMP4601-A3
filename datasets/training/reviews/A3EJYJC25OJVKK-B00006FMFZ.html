It's absolute a riveting tale of what it truly was like for the criminal underworld. Many movies seem to glorify 1930s gangsters but Road To Perdition shows a much more real life point of view of how deadly life in the 1930s criminal underworld really was. WARNING: This movie is not for the faint at heart or the shallow-minded! The cover art of the movie trailer sets the overall mood of RTP: Dark, bleak and dramatic.  <p>The story is of a criminal gang leader whose organization is being torn apart because of his son Connor Rooney going on shooting sprees for no particular reason. The main charachter Mike Sullivan, played by the talented Tom Hanks, is a hitman who works for the elder Rooney(played by Paul Newman) who has to hunt down Connor after his wife & one of his sons is murdered. Sullivan Sr. also has to protect his older son and now only surviving child, Michael Sullivan Jr. and prevent him from living a life like his father is. Another villain, played by Jude Law, is a murderer who photographs his victims as they die and rejoices at the scene. Sullivan Sr & Sullivan Jr. drive around the country robbing banks while escaping the hitman played by Jude Law. <p>The conflicts in the movie truly bring out alot of emotions and create lots of suspense and emotions. The ending is very moving and will bring you to tears. <p>By far one of the best movies and it truly deserves getting at lease on Oscar Award.</p></body></html>

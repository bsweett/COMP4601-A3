<meta name="summary" content="The Return Of The Great Adventure"></head><body><p>I don't know why people complain about his one but it must be the even numbered Indiana Jones movies that nobody likes (very similar to how fans and others respond to the odd numbered Star Treks). This was a great adventure from start to finish and I couldn't have enjoyed it better. Ford steps back into the role seamlessly. Though a little older, he still handles the action scenes just like he did back in the 80s. The Russians are now the villains of the picture and Cate Blanchett plays Spalko brilliantly, bringing Lotte Lenya's Rosa Klebb from James Bond to mind (right down to the bob hairstyle). And it was enjoyable to have a female villain (Elsa from The Last Crusade doesn't really count in my opinion as she just didn't scream "evil" to me) and, other than Mola Ram from Temple, the only villain to get into the fights. And she was a step up from Donovan, who also just didn't seem villainous enough. Shia Labeouf I could've done without. I didn't like him in Transformers and I don't like him in this. Action doesn't seem to suit him and I didn't like the fact that Lucas/Spielberg made him Indy's son, which I was hoping throughout the film that he wasn't but I was disappointed. Karen Allen makes a welcome return and I enjoyed the bickering that she and Ford did. The rest of the supporting cast is also well played. The references to Connery, Elliot and other people/artifacts from the previous films were enjoyable (especially the Ark). I didn't mind the aliens at the end as it was set in the 50s and the sci-fi tone fit in well enough (Indy locking himself in the fridge was also something that didn't bother me). I don't why people think that its implausible/impossible for aliens to make an apperance, I mean the character did go up against a guy who could take your heart out and still live so extra-terrestrials aren't that far-fetched. Action sequences are excellent but everything just seems to be CG now and I blame Lucas for that. And finally, this will be the last time (for now anyway) that I have to praise (well I guess I don't have to but he's so good) John Williams, who brings in excellent new material while working in some of the old themes as well.</p></body></html>

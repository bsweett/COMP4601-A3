"Final Destination 2" is one of the most electrifying movies ever made, and the scariest of its trilogy.<br /><br />  A similar 'premonition of mass death' to what set off the events in the first one occurs early, this time happening to a girl named Kimberly (A.J. Cook) as she and her friends are on the freeway.  Forseeing a mass car wreck (depicted terrifically onscreen with a gusto that probably outdoes any action movie car chase scene in history) she frantically tries to no avail to get a nearby police officer to close down the road, succeeding only in preventing her own group - and several cars angrily stuck behind her parked vehicle - from entering the traffic flow until after the disaster begins, as envisioned, moments later.<br /><br />  In the Final Destination mythos, Death is an entity or force that seems to have detailed plans on who it's going to claim, and when and how - and it doesn't take kindly to when its plans get thwarted by these premonitions that occur periodically.  So those who would have died in this latest disaster are targeted with a vengeance, dying in what would first appear to be accidents, and then in increasingly improbable situations as Death ups the ante and plays more recklessly.  The vicious endings met by those on Death's hit list really up the ante in imaginative mayhem and rank high on the jolt scale; sometimes it's reminescent of the insane kinetic energy in "Evil Dead 2", but without the blackly comedic edge.  The 'targets' band together reluctantly - some skeptical and hostile at first - to figure out what's happening, and eventually seek out the sole survivor of the first movie, living self-committed in an psychiatric facility, who gets involved partly to help the new group and partly to try and avenge the victims from the first movie.  "Final Destination 2" puts together an ideal, diverse group of characters, with Cook making a great central protagonist.  It defines 'high impact' through most of its running time but is fully capable of being mysterious and even emotionally subtle. (See the ambiguous but intriguing ways the character relationships develop in the background of the movie, and of course the continuing question of whether Tony Todd's undertaker character is really just an unnerving guy knowledgable in occult theories, or something more)<br /><br />  This is just done so well on every level - smartly written and directed, strong performances, outstanding special effects, high regard to production values, shot-perfect cinematography...  It's a memorable, multi-layered shocker of a movie that leaves one wanting more, and gets the highest possible rceommendation for horror fans.  A+</p></body></html>

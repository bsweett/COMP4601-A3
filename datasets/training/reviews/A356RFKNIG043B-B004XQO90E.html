<meta name="summary" content="Gyllenhall is headed for greatness"></head><body><p>Though some might say he's there already, I'd say Jake is just getting going. He's so ridiculously likeable, but somewhat distant, yet always engagingly intelligent in alomst everything he does...it's a unique take on things and every time out he brings it home. Same as always here, with a good script milking the old time travel cliches to fit our current manufactured obsession with the guaranteed-to-be-never-ending War On Terror. With the wrong lead this film could really blow, but Gyllenhall keeps it happening from start to finish.<br /><br />Source Code is another crisp character study of one man up against oblivion, as with the director's first film, Moon, and it works just as well. Come to think of it, Jake and Sam Rockwell would be an excellent pairing in a movie. Hello, Hollywood...<br /><br />There's a lot of Philip K. Dick in here, from ideas to tone, and the best part is the clever ending, which borrows from many previous time travel works to fashion a best-of-genre ending that's cheesy yet also pretty satisfying, using technology to fulfill our desire for immortality along with happy endings (oxymoronic though that may be...hey, no one ever said we were that smart...). Yet the final conceit, the morally upright soldier doing what's right against her superior's wishes, is a great concept but almost non-existent in the real world military. We only wish our soldiers put people before protocol. Oh well, this is a fantasy after all...<br /><br />If you like sci-fi or Gyllenhall (in super crisp hi-def blu-ray closeups!) or some edgy, mostly non-violent suspense, Source Code will keep you locked into an interesting mind loop for an hour and a half of your life.<br /><br />Or was it 8 minutes?</p></body></html>

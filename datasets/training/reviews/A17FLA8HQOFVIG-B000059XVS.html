<meta name="summary" content="Film making at its finest.  Don't miss it!"></head><body><p>This 1962 film is based on the true story of the unconventional British Lieutenant, who, during WW1, united Arab tribes to fight on the British side against the Turks.  How Lawrence did that was the result of his weird combination of charisma and  craziness.  And how director, David Lean, brought this epic to the screen is a result of pure genius.  Filmed on location in Jordan, the desert comes alive for the viewer.  It's mile after mile after mile of drifting sand.  But it also has places where there are lots of little rocks.  And then there are the few and far-between oases and wells.  There's danger here too, both because of the bitter tribal rivalries as well as natural dangers such as quicksand.  The camel is the accepted mode of transportation.  And thirst is something that the Bedouins learned to live with.  It's a harsh life.  The film is full of adventure.  And not just because of the characters or the action.  There's the adventure of the desert itself, and how a small speck on the horizon comes out of a mirage and becomes a human being.  This all comes alive by a vision, one that had never been done on screen before.  It was an ambitious undertaking. And a huge success.<p>The acting was outstanding.  And so were all the special effects, although the cast of thousands who were real live people.  It's a refreshing difference to computer-generated scenes we've become accustomed to.  And a type of filming that we will not likely see again.  For that alone, the film stands as a testament to human ingenuity.  A couple of details bothered me, such as the makeup on Peter O'Toole whose fair skin was supposed to look sunburned, but somehow looked as if he had thick clay on his face.  But this was minor. I also thought the film was too long and missed a traditional arc of plot which I've come to expect.  I found myself drowsing off during the last half hour as it all seemed repetitive and superfluous to what had come before. <p>I watched all the DVD special features the next morning.  And they were wonderful.  It was then I realized that the print I had watched had been restored in 1989, with 35 minutes added to the epic.  Some of the sound had been lost at that time and I found it fascinating as to how they brought back the actors to dub in their own voices again.  I love learning about all the background and hearing the actors talk about the experience. Don't miss this wonderful DVD.  Just make sure that you give yourself enough time to watch the film in its entirety.  And add on another couple of hours to see the special features.  You'll come away with an experience of your own that goes beyond merely watching a film.  Clearly, it rates one of my highest recommendations.</p></body></html>

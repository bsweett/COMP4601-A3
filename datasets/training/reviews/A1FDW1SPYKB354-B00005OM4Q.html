Immensely Entertaining! 6 Stars Out Of 5!!"></head><body><p>I had the awful feeling that I was going to hate this movie when I popped in this DVD for my inaugural look at the film. But my initial apprehension toward the picture vaporized almost instantly upon watching the film's first scene.<br /><br />I couldn't believe how much I liked this movie.  In my view, Director/Producer/Writer Cameron Crowe has done the near-impossible with this motion picture.  That being: He's taken a group of people that could have been so easily looked down upon and intensely disliked, and instead turned this assorted band of musicians, groupies, mothers, sisters, and rock-n-roll managers into some of the most interesting and fun-to-watch individuals ever to share a movie set together.<br /><br />Add to this mix one very likeable-right-off-the-bat young 15-year-old would-be music journalist (played to perfection by Patrick Fugit), and what you have in your midst is a highly-entertaining movie about ambition, music, a devoted mother's love, soul-searching, friendships, and chasing dreams.<br /><br />Every scene in this film is a memorable one. The whole movie feels "real", in this writer's opinion. Nothing seems faked, or phonied, or Hollywoodized. A reason for this, of course, is in large part due to the fact that the film is a great deal auto-biographical, with Fugit portraying Crowe when Cameron was a teenaged writer for Rolling Stone Magazine.<br /><br />And while it's rated "R" (for language and drug content), the film never once bogs itself down with the cliched rock band negativity of drugs, sex, and booze.  Sure, these elements are shown through Mr. Crowe's camera lens; but it's never displayed in such a way as to be a turnoff.  If this film were in the form of a book, it would indeed be described as a real "page turner".  The viewer anxiously awaits the next "page" (scene).<br /><br />There are two scenes in this film that are true "set pieces" in my mind (and after just seeing the movie one time).  One such piece occurs as the fictional band with which our talented young "Rolling Stone" journalist ("William Miller") is travelling encounters severe turbulence on an airplane flight taking the group to its next concert date.  As the severe thunderstorm batters the plane to the point where all aboard are nearly convinced they'll soon be meeting an untimely demise, one by one the passengers begin to confess their inner-most secrets and indiscretions. This fabulous scene is at the same time comical, bittersweet, and poignant.  As the aircraft finally breaks free of the turbulent air, much to the delight of the exuberant pilots, our band of passengers is too mentally drained from the confessions they've just offered up to each other to join in the celebration of the fact that they are, in fact, going to survive the ordeal.  The scene concludes comically with a member of the group, who has just informed everyone of a dark secret concerning sexual orientation, slamming the cockpit door closed to silence the cheers of the pilots.  Great, great scene!<br /><br />Another highly-memorable portion of the film takes place on the band's tour bus.  Elton John can be heard on the bus radio, singing "Tiny Dancer".  Gradually, the vehicle is filled with singing, as everyone begins joining Elton in belting out the tune.  This scene is one to play over and over again, as the feeling of togetherness and harmony fills the bus at that moment.<br /><br />The DVD presentation here is as flawless as the film contained on the disc.  Picture quality is exceptional via the nice 1.85:1 Widescreen Anamorphic transfer. And the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround soundtrack is definitely robust enough to give those speakers a nice workout, especially during the many musical numbers heard throughout the movie.<br /><br />There's an adequate Making-Of featurette included as well, which contains several photos of a young Cameron Crowe "on the road" as a Rolling Stone scribe.<br /><br />For anyone who hasn't seen this picture who might be thinking (as I did before viewing it) that this is a movie filled with loud, obnoxious, cocaine-snorting booze-heads and the less-than-desirable environs that people of that ilk generally inhabit, let me assure you that "Almost Famous" will pleasantly surprise you.<br /><br />These characters are well-written, never "over the top", and totally engaging from the first chapter of this DVD until the last.<br /><br />It immediately has zoomed into my Top 25 of all-time favorite flicks!<br /><br />I still can't believe how truly good this movie is.  It's one that could easily be viewed time and again, and enjoyed just as much with each successive screening.</p></body></html>

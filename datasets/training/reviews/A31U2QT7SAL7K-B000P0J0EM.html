Although only seen as the &quot;old Paul Edgecomb,&quot; Greer makes a memorable turn as the elder version of Tom Hanks in the movie's closing moments.  His quiet and dignified soliloquy is truly touching.  I cannot tell how moved I was by such a topper to this outstanding bit of storytelling.  Greer, as well as all parties involved, magnificently brought one of Stephen King's best works to the screen.  Along with &quot;The Shawshank Redemption,&quot; &quot;Mile&quot; ranks as the most faithful and cinematically satisfying of any jump from page to the cinema.</p></body></html>

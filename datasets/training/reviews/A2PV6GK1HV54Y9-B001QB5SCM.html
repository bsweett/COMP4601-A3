Cameron Diaz plays Maggie, a not so responsible woman and Toni Collette plays Rose, her up-tight sis trying to force Maggie to "grow-up." I couldn't believe how good Diaz is in this film, the best performance of her career, so vulnerable and real. Collette is great in any movie she sinks her British teeth in. Their relationship gets tested Maggie has a fling with Rose's potential boyfriend. Maggie goes looking for the grandma she didn't know she had played by Shirley McClaine. Rose and Maggie learn interesting things about themselves along the way, separately of course. Can their tarnished relationship be fixed, you just have to rent this chick flick and see for yourself.</p></body></html>

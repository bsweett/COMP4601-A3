Goodbye!"></head><body><p>Matt King (George Clooney) lives in paradise but he couldn't be farther from paradise than he is at this moment. He sits in a hospital room where his wife lies in a coma after a horrific boating accident that occurred off of Waikiki Beach. He goes home to care for his 10 year old daughter that he rarely has been with because of his travels and work load. His daughter is an out of control foul mouthed brat who has no respect for anyone. His older 17 year old daughter is in a private boarding school and she is even more ill-tempered and disrespectful.<br /><br />Matt was so involved in his life as a lawyer and the fact that he was the caretaker of the family's trust fund of billions of dollars of pristine land in Hawaii that he rarely had time for his family. Now he is seeing the results of his self-centered life and he is facing the consequences.<br /><br />When he tries to tell his older daughter that her mom is severely injured she tells him that she doesn't care. She has hated her mom since their big fight at Christmas. She tells her dad that she caught her mom cheating on him with another man and that he had no clue what was going on.....<br /><br />This is a tragic story of a dysfunctional family faced with the potential loss of their wife and mother and having no relationship with each other. Matt who wants to blame his wife for having an affair, realizes that if she had been happy then she would not have cheated. If he had been a better father then his daughters would be more respectful and loving.<br /><br />How they cope with the pending loss and with each other is an endearing story of human relationships and failures. The saga is a sad story of lost loves and lost family members and of trying to rebuild a normal life. In the end Matt realizes that no matter what has happened, he loves his wife and his daughters more than ever. Perhaps there is a chance for some happiness after all!<br /><br />We enjoyed this movie and felt that it was very good. It is a good lesson that life is not about money and riches but of the love and the relationships you have with your family and friends. I believe you will like this movie. It is well acted and the storyline is very good.<br /><br />Nothing can touch the following words of Matt to his wife:<br /><br />Goodbye Elizabeth. Goodbye my love. My friend. My pain. My joy. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye!</p></body></html>

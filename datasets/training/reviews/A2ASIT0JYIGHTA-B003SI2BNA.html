<meta name="summary" content="Better than the reviews here will have you believe"></head><body><p>This movie has received many bad reviews, but to be honest I really enjoyed it despite it being far from perfect.  The acting from Jennifer Connelly was brilliant as a mother who is trying to move forward with her life but there are things in the past and present which are preventing that. I felt truly sorry for her, which I think was the director's intention. Let's face it, a movie succeeds if you feel for the key characters.  The film is a remake of a Japanese film, and I look forward to seeing that version to compare one day.<br /><br />As a viewer, I was unsure of what was reality or fantasy at times, but that made the film all the more intriguing for me.  I thought the leaking roof was a brilliant storyline (particularly since I had experienced something similar in an apartment many years ago).  Overall, the creepiness of the apartment block was well conveyed.<br /><br />I recommend this movie for those who enjoy the odd creepy film, and for fine acting too.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A hopeful tale"></head><body><p>Winter's Bone, an adaptation of Daniel Woodrell's 2006 novel of the same name, is about the ravages of meth in rural communities of America. Although this is a very depressing subject, ultimately this is a movie about hope and strength, a story of a kid's transformation from a girl to a woman, when she has to fend for her siblings as their father abandons them. This is a good story and has been directed well but after a few days after having seen the movie, the performance of the lead Jennifer Lawrence lingers forever.</p></body></html>

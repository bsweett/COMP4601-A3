<meta name="summary" content="A stunning masterpiece!"></head><body><p>As applied to millions of others, I was deeply saddened at the passing of Ray Charles back in June of 2004. He was an amazing pianist and had among the most amazing talent that I have ever seen in my entire life.<br /><br /> The movie "Ray" is a brilliant and vivid intake into the first 30 to 40 years of his life from his childhood glaucoma that led to permanent blindness to the turbulent but ultimately triumphant rise to being the most beloved entertainer in the world up into the last days of his life.<br /><br /> Played by Jamie Foxx, I was absolutely amazed at how well Fox portrayed Ray Charles in this movie. Throughout the entire film I wasn't even aware that it was even Foxx who was playing Ray Charles himself because he looks so much like a younger adult Ray in this film.<br /><br /> I've always had a great respect for his music and how he played the piano so well without the use of his eyesight for the latter 66 years of his life (He was completely blind by age 7).<br /><br /> This is a highly recommended movie that you must pick up today ASAP.</p></body></html>

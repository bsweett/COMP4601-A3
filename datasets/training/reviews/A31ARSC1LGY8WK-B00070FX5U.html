<meta name="summary" content="A bleak view of the future where corporate greed rules"></head><body><p>Paul Verhoeven's bleak view of the future that was present in "Robocop" continues in "Total Recall". In this future corporations make their own rules and are indifferent to the suffering of anybody that stands in their way. One can see both films as devastating satires of Reagan-era America.<br /><br />As with "Robocop" Verhoeven indulges in gratuitous violence and grim humour that leaves one with a slightly bad taste in the mouth. Still "Total Recall" moves at lightening pace and the special effects are pretty good. There are also lots of nice humorous details included by Verhoeven and a superb score from Jerry Goldsmith.</p></body></html>

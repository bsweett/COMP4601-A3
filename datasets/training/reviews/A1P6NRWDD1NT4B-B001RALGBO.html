<meta name="summary" content="Lousy Title..Mediocre  Film"></head><body><p>There was a 1983 made-for-tv film called THE DAY AFTER about the nuclear holocaust. The "creative team" behind this current film decided to tack on '...TOMORROW' at the end. Thus, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is the name of the film almost in the same ballpark of humans on the verge of being destroyed by a disaster. The 1983 film, to reiterate, was about a pre and post nuclear attack brought on by other humans.  THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is about the onset of a new ice age out to destroy mankind which is a natural disaster. Nothing new here except that digital special effects can do anything in spectacular fashion. Therefore it allows the viewer to suspend disbelief and see if the characters of the film and the whole human race in general can survive this catastrophe.  This is a rehash of ARMAGEDDON, GODZILLA, INDEPENDENCE DAY, THE CORE,DEEP IMPACT, EARTHQUAKE with a slight new twist. THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is a pure popcorn summer action disaster movie. However, it is not very memorable story wise or character wise and the film will probably leave the viewer feeling empty and cold (no pun intended!). Lastly, the creators could have come out with a more inventive title. It sounds more closely to the recent inane James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) film titles (TOMORROW NEVER DIES, THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH, DIE ANOTHER DAY ...).</p></body></html>

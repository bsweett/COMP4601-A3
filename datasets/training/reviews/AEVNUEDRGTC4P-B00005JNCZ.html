<meta name="summary" content="Not Too Insightful Look At Che Guevara"></head><body><p>The  Motorcycle Diaries is an unusual biographical movie in that no real attempt is made to gain insight into the main character.  Why did Che Guevara go from being a young doctor into becoming a human killing machine?  While members of the medical profession did periodically join revolutionary units, it was almost always as soldiers serving in a medical role.  Medical student Guevara was unusual in that he became a leader instead of remaining a medic.<br /><br />Basically, The Motorcycle Diaries does not present a whole picture of Che Guevara's growth.  It is mainly a nice exhibition of countryside cinematography.  Its something of a buddies on the road picture.  It offers little insight into Guevara or why he would abandon medicine for killing people in the name of Marxist revolution.<br /><br />Basically, The Motorcycle Diaries is just cotton candy for the mind.  Watch it for fluff and simple relaxation only.</p></body></html>

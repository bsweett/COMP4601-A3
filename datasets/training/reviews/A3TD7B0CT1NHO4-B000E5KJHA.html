<meta name="summary" content="A Different Wonka!!!"></head><body><p>To be fair - this is not Gene Wilder's Wonka character, nor should it be confused with Wilder.  Neither should it be measured against that earlier version, and I've seen the Wilder version many times.  This is a very interesting film, and to the credit of Johnny Depp, he makes it his own.  There are some different twists to the movie and other reviewers have highlighted them, and this review will only share that it was an enjoyable film, with an upbeat score, and some twists on the plot.  Charlie still has his Grampa Joe, and his background as a former worker in the Chocolate Factory added some different drama to the film.<br /><br />If you're looking for something a little off the beaten path, but with some entertaining characters and music, you may want to check this film out.  Recommended!!!</p></body></html>

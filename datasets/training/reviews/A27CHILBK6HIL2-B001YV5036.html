<meta name="summary" content="A Great Film, Great Acting, But It's Formulaic"></head><body><p>MOVIE: Cinderella Man is the true story of James Braddock who watched is entire life wither away right in front of his eyes during The Great Depression.  Braddock held the reputation of never being knocked out and was at the top.  Then things began to go downhill, and the movie jumps right to that point in his life. He lives in a dark little apartment barely making ends meet.  Then things go from bad to worse when the boxing commission takes away his license after a string of bad performances and a broken hand that led one fight to be a draw. Braddock is now down at the docks where they only select 5 or 6 men to work on a dialy basis.  His house is without electricity, without heat, and his kids are getting sick.  There is a scene where his son steals a stick of salami from the butcher because he witnessed one of his friends being sent away due to the fact that his parents couldn't afford to feed their children.  In the scene after Braddock promises his son that no matter what happens, he would never send him away.  A few days later when he is out, his wife Mae does in fact send the children to her parents' house.  So now we have James Braddock as low as it gets, and this is where the movie picks up to hold true with its title.  Braddock's trainer, played to perfection by Paul Giammatti, confronts him with an offer.  After another fighter drops out, he is able to fill his shoes with Braddock for a one-time only fight for $250.  Suprisingly, Braddock knocks the wind right out of his opponent and the down hill roll becomes an uphill climb to the top.  Now Braddock must fight heavyweight champion Max Baer who has killed 2 men in the ring.  The film is very well made, Ron Howard adds a professional touch to the film and gives it an old fashioned feel.  The film does an excellent job of capturing post-depression 1930's.  There are some great transitions used that will catch your eye, and the boxing scenes are filmed with perfection.  The audience really gets into the movie, your hands and body will tense up and even your heart rate may rise because the boxing scenes are very intense.  Ron Howard made sure that the audience was not watching the boxing, but instead was part of the boxing.  The only problem with the movie that I had was that it was way too formulaic.  This movie is like any other inspirational sports story, but the fact that was made with careful precision rises the film to the top.  This movie could have been a bore, but Howard was able to really connect with the audience and that was the difference.<br /><br />ACTING: When you have a leading actor, actress, director, producer, and composer who have all won Academy Awards you know you can expect top notch filmmaking.  Russell Crowe and Renee Zellweger do a fine job with their roles, nothing to complain.  They are up to par with previous performances in their history.  However, it is Paul Giammatti who stands above the rest as usual.  Giammatti portrays Braddock's manager with perfection.  Some critics believe he is the greatest character actor of all time, and I have to agree.  This man deserves an Academy Award, but I don't think he'll get one here because he's done better work.  He really deserved it for Sideways, but what are you gonna do.  I hate people who say "oh, he deserves it, just give it to him."  If the AMPAS just handed out Oscars to those that deserve it then the Oscar ceremony would lose all credibility.  Scorsese deserves an Oscar, yes, but not for Gangs of New York or The Aviator.  He's done better work than that, you can't just give them out for the hell of it.  Sorry, I'm ranting.  Overall it has excellent acting, even the kids do a good job, but the story is very formulaic, so the characters end up being formulaic too.  Aging athlete once at the top, now at the bottom, must rise and overcome obstacles.  His wife and kids are the only things that matter.  Nobody believes in him, but he rises to the occassion and becomes a hero.  Sound familiar? Sure, but the movie is still great.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  Cinderella Man is fantastic even though you can follow the plot like a road map.  I just feel that the movie was only greenlit because boxing seems to be the "thing" right now.  Million Dollar Baby just took in a boat load of Oscars including Best Picture, and The Contender is a popular thing on TV. However, it's a movie that really gets the audience emotionally involved, and those are hard to find nowdays.  The audience I saw it with gave the film a round of applause at the end, so you can see that it is a croud pleaser.  One last thing I wanted to mention, the NBC advertising within the movie hurt it quite a bit.  As you know, Universal and NBC recently merged, and this is a Universal release.  Everytime there is a news conference, or a shot of the announcer ringside, the microphones they are speaking into all have "NBC" big and bold.  They picked a white font on a film with muted colors so it stood out quite a bit. Just thought it felt a bit intrusive, and you see it in about 10-15 shots of the film.</p></body></html>

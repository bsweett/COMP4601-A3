<meta name="summary" content="Not the best of scripts, but funny"></head><body><p>This is almost a live-action Dilbert movie.  This film takes a look at modern corporate culture and lampoons it.  If you have ever worked in a cubicle, this movie will strike a chord within you.  Whether you are seeing the consultants, or efficiency experts, interview people before the lay-off; listening to the sing-song voice of the customer service representative, or watching the employees get mad at the fax machine; this will all seem eerily familiar.<p>Quite a few of the scenes nod to other movies of popular culture, as well as sate our thirst for revenge against work.  This mixture makes from some memorable images.  The camera work used as the conspirators initiate their plan or "celebrate" their lay-off is hilarious.<p>My problem with the film is that it feels great as a series of short films, but as a whole movie, it doesn't hold up as well.  Although Mike Judge (who wrote, directed, and acted here) forecasts what would happen in the end, it still feels like "deus ex machina."  It feels like he couldn't think of how to end it, so he just threw this in.  It does take some suspension of disbelief.  The argument between Peter and his girlfriend also seems a little contrived.<p>All in all, this is a funny movie.  I would recommend seeing it.</p></body></html>

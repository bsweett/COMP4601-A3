<meta name="summary" content="JOHN FORD Film: Western, on DVD."></head><body><p>John Ford and John Wayne team up again to make another Western film, they also worked together on Stagecoach. This film also stars, Natalie Wood, and Vera Miles. A well made drama, with the old West as the backdrop, realistic looking, and good use of color and camera techniques, plus a lot of action.</p></body></html>

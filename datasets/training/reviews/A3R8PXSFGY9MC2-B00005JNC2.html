<meta name="summary" content="Great debut from Braff"></head><body><p>This is a great film, especially considering it's Braff's first attempt at writing and direction. It has a slightly melancholic undertone to it which tends to make the relationships and storyline that little bit more poignant. It also has some funny laugh out loud moments, so you get a good mix of emotions in the one film. What's more it has one of the best soundtracks I've heard in a film for ages. Well worth giving a go!<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

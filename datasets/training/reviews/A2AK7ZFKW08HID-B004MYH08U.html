I was very surprised that hardly anyone liked it. I almost didnt watch it myself because of the bad reviews, but my local library had it so I decided to give it a shot, and I am so glad I did. I ran out to Wal Mart right away and bought the 3D version. Give it a shot, you will be happy you did.</p></body></html>

I honestly was not expecting too much out of this movie, because most old television shows that are turned into movies, are really bad (i.e. Mod Squad).  Then I looked at who was directing this movie and who was staring in it and my hopes became higher.  This movie actually worked.<p>Ben Stiller plays Starsky, the by the rules cop, and Owen Wilson play "Hutch", the surfer dude type cop whom always tries to benefit from his busts.  The two actors have great chemistry together on screen.  Vince Vaughn plays the cocaine dealer, I forgot his name, and does what he normally does in his movies.  This movie had many funny parts and for some reason, I can't help laughing everytime that I see Stiller on the screen.  If you want a movie that will make you laugh, check out this movie.</p></body></html>

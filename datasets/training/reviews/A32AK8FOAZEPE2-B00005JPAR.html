<meta name="summary" content="too dark, too sad, too deseparate and hopeless"></head><body><p>switching back and present, part of sci-fi, part of real, life and death, cancer or tumor, eternal and everlasting love and romance, nebula or the 3rd world, after life and present suffering. this movie is so dark and so sorrowfully panned out. very good performances in a zigzagged screenplay. the world according to garp, existing or non-existing, cross over to after life, zen, meditation, slow burning devastate and desperate situation, cosmos, universe, nebula, dying star, reborn....but that's when you are alive and still could imagine that those things indeed exist and could happen, but once you're dead, nothing exists any more. paradise? anybody ever came back from there? is death just a gateway to another extension of being? you tell me, i really don't know and couldn't have cared less.</p></body></html>

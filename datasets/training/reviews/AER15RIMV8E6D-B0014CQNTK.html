<meta name="summary" content="Teen Pregnancy Has Never Been Funnier!!!"></head><body><p>Juno was actually better than I thought it would be. It had some pretty funny moments. I like how it started in Autumn around Halloween. I like how she starts a friendly relationship with Jennifer Garner's husband, Mark Loring, because he happens to like the same stuff Juno does. I like her dialogue and comebacks. One thing that was kinda wierd was the music they played throughout the film. (The soundtrack.) If you love comedy, and pregnant teenagers, you'll love JUNO!!!<br /><br />On a personal note: This movie reminds me of some of my friends a few years ago in high school that got pregnant and dropped out...I miss them! One of them actually danced with me 4 years ago at a dance.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Something Is Just "Off" About This Sequel"></head><body><p>"Silence of the Lambs", the movie from which "Hannibal" is spawned, was an exercise in  creepiness from beginning to end.  The scenes with Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are almost alive with tension, while the overall plot is well-executed and creepy enough to make you legitimately "weird-ed out" on more than one occasion.  Sadly, this sequel fails to live up to any of those previous benchmarks.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Hannibal" sees Clarice Starling (now played by Julianne Moore) as an under-appreciated F.B.I. agent.  Out of the blue, Starling is contacted by Mason Verger (Gary Oldman), an old victim of Dr. Lecter, who portends to have some new information regarding the whereabouts of Hannibal (Anthony Hopkins).<br /><br />Though difficult to pinpoint exactly what is wrong with what could have been a blockbuster sequel, I believe it is the combination of "little things" that really do this movie in.  For instance...<br /><br />-The tension in "Lambs" comes from the fact that one can never quite "figure out" Hannibal.  At times he seems like a civil genius, yet obviously he is also quite twisted psychologically.  This produces a sense of fear in the vein of "what will he do next".  This movie holds none of that intensity, with Hannibal being portrayed as an "old romantic" instead of a cutting-edge personality.<br /><br />-The lack of scenes involving both Hannibal & Clarice is also unforgivable.  That is where the first movie really succeeds, and here it comes both late and not enough.<br /><br />-Maybe it is the writing, but Foster's Clarice was much more interesting than Moore's doppelganger.  Whereas Foster was vulnerable and conflicted, Moore is just "straight arrow" with no compromises or shades of grey.  Either character would work in the context of the films, but it is the sudden shift between them that makes Moore's performance just seem wrong.<br /><br />-Finally, the "Buffalo Bill" main plotline of "Lambs" far outshines anything this film has to offer.  The visuals of the faceless Verger are striking, for sure, but his character is terribly developed.  He is built up to be the "primary villain", but I found myself not caring about him whatsoever.<br /><br />In essence, "Hannibal" (while not utter, 1-star type trash) is a failure due to the fact that it changes the formula so much from its predecessor.  The tension is gone, the interesting characters are gone, and what remains is a lot of police procedure and talking.  A shame, considering the potential that was wasted.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Extravagantly Whimsical and Sentimental Family Drama."></head><body><p>&quot;Big Fish&quot; has been adapted from the novel of the same name by Daniel Wallace and directed by Tim Burton. This whimsical tale of a strained parent-child relationship is Burton's most personal film to date. It's a story of a son returning to his childhood home, where his father is fatally ill, in hopes of discovering the man behind the myth that his father has always cultivated. &quot;Big Fish&quot; is in many ways a family drama with typical family themes, yet its otherworldly elements lend the film a distinct Burtonesque tone and appearance.<p>Edward Bloom has been a personable man and a great storyteller all his life. His fantastic tales have been loved by all, no matter how much truth or myth they may contain. But ever since his son, Will Bloom (Billy Crudup), was old enough to realize the stories couldn't be entirely true, he has resented his father's unwillingness to say things the way they are. Estranged as adults, Will visits his dying father (Albert Finney) in hopes of learning the truth behind the magnificent tales of Edward's youth and gaining an understanding of the man he has known only through elaborate myths.<p>Although &quot;Big Fish&quot; is telling us the story of Edward and Will's relationship, Edward, true to form, tells us his life's story in fantastic tales. So the film spends most of its time recounting Edward Bloom's life story as he tells it, with young Edward played with great charm by Ewan McGregor. These adventures are a visual feast and don't seem to compete with the film's present-tense father-son drama. The myth and the drama are blended seamlessly, much to Tim Burton's and screenwriter John August's credit. The faults I find with &quot;Big Fish&quot; are that some of its stories would have been more interesting told rather than seen, and the odd conglomeration of stories that constitute Edward's repertoire sometimes give the film  an uneven pace. It goes without saying that &quot;Big Fish&quot; is sentimental. It most closely resembles Burton's &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; in tone.<p>The DVD: Bonus features include two multi-part featurettes, which can also be viewed during the film by activating a feature called &quot;Fish Tales&quot;, a trivia quiz, and an audio commentary by director Tim Burton. When activated, &quot;Fish Tales&quot; displays an icon on your screen during the film's playback that will take you to the relevant featurette. The first featurette, &quot;The Character's Journey&quot; contains three parts, each focusing primarily on one of the film's characters: the young Edward Bloom, circus ringmaster Amos Callaway, and Will Bloom. The film's cast and director Tim Burton discuss the characters in interviews. The second featurette is &quot;The Filmmaker's Path&quot;, which has four parts. Tim Burton talks about the film's themes and inspirations. The production designer and effects coordinators discuss their role in expressing those themes. The fourth part, which is entitled &quot;The Author's Journey&quot; and features interviews with author Daniel Wallace and screenwriter John August, may be of interest to those who have read the book. &quot;The Fine Points: A Trivia Quiz&quot; is a game which allows you to view a short documentary about filming the circus scene if you answer the trivia questions. Tim Burton's audio commentary has an unusual format. It's an interview, so there is someone asking Burton specific questions as the subjects come up during the movie. This makes the commentary kind of low-key, but very informative. Burton talks about every aspect of the film, from its themes in relation to his own life to comments about the performances to technical details of filming. Subtitles are available in English and French. Dubbing is available in French. There are two unavoidable previews on the disc.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Dark, moody flawed thriller has strong moments and performances."></head><body><p>Filled with surreal imagery, supported by strong performances from Leonardo DiCaprio, Ben Kingsley, Mark Ruffalo, the marvelous Max Von Sydow and Jackie Early Haley "Shutter Island" has some magnificent moody movements and while it isn't great Scorsese it is very good indeed. A mystery thriller based on Dennis Lehane's (GONE BABY GONE)novel the moody mystery revolves around a patient that has simply vanished from an island for the criminally insane and the pair of federal marshals Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio)a troubled veteran of World War II still disturbed by the images he saw when he helped liberate a German concentration camp and his new partner Chuck Aule (Ruffalo) trying to determine why they are being stonewalled about her disappearance. It's clear from the beginning to Daniels that the staff at the isolated hospital seems to be hiding something the trouble is that everything seems to be hiding in plain sight. On the surface they get cooperation but it's also quite clear that there are members of the staff and even some of the patients that have been carefully rehearsed to hide something.<br /><br />While "Shutter Island" isn't among the best films that Scorsese has made it does demonstrate what a talented film director can do with good source material. At turns spooky and suspense "Shutter Island" probably could have been trimmed about 10 minutes. The main flaw of the film is that it doesn't pander to its audience by using rapid fire editing techniques to generate an artificial feeling of suspense and unease instead relying on craftsmanship and strong, intelligent performances by the performers in the film. Keep in mind that "Shutter Island" is an example of a slow, moody thriller and, in many respects, is a throwback to the type of thrillers we might have seen in the 70's (which isn't a surprise given that Scorsese came of age as a film director during that time). Don't expect the rapid fire editing of "Final Destination" or linear narrative of most contemporary films. "Shutter Island" has more in common with "Memento" or Chris Nolan's mixed genre thriller "The Prestige" than "The Bourne Identity". I'd also note that the film is a moody homage to Hitchcock's thrillers.<br /><br />Scorsese has never been a director that has focused on complex plots (although there are exceptions in his career but those exceptions have usually been when he's been paired with a strong writing collaborator) as much as complex characters. Perhaps that's the Achilles' heel of "Shutter Island" as the occasionally careens out of control as we watch Teddy dig deeper and deeper into the mystery that drives him to want to discover the evil at the heart of "Shutter Island". Working with the novel's strong more conventional narrative may have been too much a challenge for the director and his creative visuals. Nevertheless even if he does stumble the film manages to hold together fairly well and continues to be entertaining. Fans of the novel, suspenseful mystery thrillers, DiCaprio and Scorsese will still find much to admire and the last sequence in the film still cuts deeply.<br /><br />The conclusion of the film particularly the last dialogue exchange between DiCaprio and Ruffalo validates the film. Scorsese makes "Shutter Island" a suspenseful thriller that echoes some of Hitchcock's classic psychological thrillers (particularly "Vertigo" in its stylized look)producing a film that isn't afraid to look into the abyss of a lost soul in fear that the abyss might look back.</p></body></html>

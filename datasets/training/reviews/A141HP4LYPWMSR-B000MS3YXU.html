<meta name="summary" content=""Do You Feel An Awakening?"  ~  A Symbolist, Guardian, Guild And Healer Encounter The Blue World"></head><body><p>According to Story (Bryce Dallas Howard), the enchanting and mysterious sea nymph from the Blue World, "All beings have a purpose." She has come to the world of land dwellers at tremendous personal risk to awaken our world to this knowledge. However there are unseen evil forces lurking in the shadows that wish to prevent Story from accomplishing her mission. Only by revealing the Symbolist, the Guardian, the Guild and the Healer can Story be saved and the rest of mankind as well.<br /><br />`The Lady in the Water' ('06) is rather slow and surprisingly predictable but it also exudes an almost ethereal atmosphere that's unexplainably appealing. Coupled with a haunting soundtrack, the film succeeds in drawing the viewer inexorably into Shyamalan's mythical landscape. Bryce Dallas Howard is wonderfully enigmatic and Paul Giamatti once again proves himself to be one of the best actors on the scene today.<br /><br />My rating: 3 1/2 Stars</p></body></html>

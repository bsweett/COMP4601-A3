<meta name="summary" content="Pass on diner with the Firefly family"></head><body><p>The other night Sid started backwards by watching Devil's Rejects before it's predecessor House of 1000 Corpses. Thanks yet again to our on-demand station that made this one came available while all the characters were still fresh on the mind. Have to say despite a lot of the reviews this was one very creepy flick that takes place with a very uncomfortable situation. That situation would be getting stranded in some hick town to be welcomed in by a family that turns out to be serial killers also housing the local legend known as Dr. Satan. Yeah it was absolutely as crazy as it sounds, and Sid loved it.<br /><br />The movie starts out with 2 couples who are on the road looking to write a book about the countries strange roadside attractions. The first stop they hit is Captain Spauldings fried chicken and gasoline, that also has a funhouse type tour. While there they learn the legend of Dr. Satan and decide to take off in hopes of finding the tree he hung from. Once there car breaks down after piking up a hitchhiker named Daisy (Rob Zombies tasty wife) all the fun begins. We are introduced to the ultra-physcotic Firefly family that couple well with Leatherface's relatives. In addition they house Dr. Satan who performs experiments on people they catch while they're still alive. Some actual creepy moments, which is so rare in film.<br /><br />So very surprisingly House of 1000 Corpses was one of the better horror films Sid has seen in sometime. The way it was shot was very dark with hints black comedy and a lot of tripped out imagery. It almost seemed like certain scenes were made for those viewers kicking back stoned out of their minds. Oh yeah, oh yeah. Now obviously it is nearly impossible to be scared by a film, but this one had a lot of creepy elements especially toward the end. When they finally found the Dr, who looked like the crypt-keeper with an oxygen mask on, and his butler the giant axe maniac the scenes got very tense. Just the thought of coming across that would freak anyone out. So yes we really enjoyed and would have years back thanks to all the scares and Sheri Zombie nudity.</p></body></html>

It is a telling comment when an actor makes you forget that you are watching Leonardo DiCaprio or Djimon Hounsou and convinces you that you are watching an unscrupulous smuggler and a fisherman.  Probably the overwhelming number of films that I have seen will have a scene that stretches the truth, something less than credible that makes the story exciting but is beyond the realm of certainty.  Blood Diamond, on the other hand, comes over like a piece of good journalism and you feel as if you are watching events as they unfolded.<br /><br />The story of the film has been nicely summarized by other reviewers.  It is, indeed, a story that has several layers one of them being the misery of modern Africa with its unstable governments and extreme poverty.  We see the immense piles of garbage that are the playgrounds for children and the enslavement of children by militias that turn them into child soldiers who are devoid of the simple delights of being children.  Greed is the overriding motive for Danny Archer, Solomon Vandy and Colonel Coetzee and Captain Poison.  Archer sees the diamond as his ticket out of Africa and Arnold Vosloo (and Captain Poison as well) for its fabulous wealth.  The sympathetic choice is Solomon because he not only found the stone (made a slave by the rebels and forced to pan for diamonds) but he would make a better life for his impoverished family.  On the other side of the diamond trade is journalist Maddy Bowen (played by Jennifer Connelly) who wants to expose the misery that Africans are forced to endure searching for diamonds and the cartel turns a blind eye toward.  She begins a relationship with Archer and appears to slowly change his feelings toward the diamond corporation he smuggles for from one of complicity to a willingness to let her expose them.<br /><br />Director Edward Zwick (who also directed Glory and The Last Samurai) has produced another masterpiece of story telling.  The final scene is unforgettable as Solomon (the best performance I have seen Djimon Hounsou give), now reunited with his family in London, is about to tell his story before a commission investigating the diamond trade.  The film also makes a plea to us, the people who buy diamonds, to become responsible for discovering where the stone came from and if it could be a smuggled diamond.  This film will probably make you see diamonds in a new light and remind us that we can play a part to end the misery of how these gems are mined.</p></body></html>

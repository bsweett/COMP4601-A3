I mentioned this in my Voyage of the Dawn Treader review, so I won't rehash the same material. Let's just say Narnia has always been held in high regard in my household and I may let flaws that bother some slide because I love the material so much. C.S. Lewis' Narnia books are often compared to J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings given their similarities (living trees, created languages, rescues from towers by flying creatures, etc) and the fact that both men were members of the Inklings, a literary discussion group. I never got into Tolkien's literary works, but I prefer the Narnia films in comparison to the LOTR rings films. Despite the LOTR films being epic in their own right, they're a bit too long for casual viewing and I still feel burnt out on them eight years later whereas I feel like I can watch The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe pretty much any time it comes on television.<br /><br />The Narnia films seem to stray further and further from the source material each time a new sequel is released. Prince Caspian veered way off course while Dawn Treader felt like it was more action packed yet still went off and did its own thing at times. The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is probably the one true Narnia film we're going to get. A certain character was given a name that didn't have one in the book and certain things were left out, but the events that transpired all took place in the book and weren't added just to be added like a few of the sequences in Prince Caspian.<br /><br />While the cast is nearly impeccable and the story is practically parallel with the book, the special effects are where The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe deserves the most credit. WETA did an exceptional job bringing talking animals, both of the mythical and traditional varieties, to life. The black minotaur general looked really fantastic, but Aslan has to be the film's greatest computer generated accomplishment. He looks incredibly realistic, especially with his hair constantly blowing in the wind. These special effects bringing these spectacular creatures to life are practically the icing on the cake on making a Narnia film work. Without them, the film just wouldn't be the same and wouldn't do the source material justice.<br /><br />The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is something special. The cast is able to bring these beloved characters to life in the best of ways and the astounding special effects make talking animals look like something we should see on a day to day basis. The last few lines of the film give you goose bumps as several scenes in the film leave you with that warm, fuzzy feeling inside; that one that makes you feel so happy your eyes well up with tears of joy. Only a certain number of films can trigger that. This film is able to display the magic C.S. Lewis wrote seven glorious novels about as it captures your imagination and doesn't let it go until you see that lamppost for the last time. It's safe to say the The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is a defining family film of our generation.</p></body></html>

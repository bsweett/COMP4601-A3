<meta name="summary" content="Action adventure as good as it gets"></head><body><p>For a thrilling action adventure movie for all ages you can't get much better than this original Steven Spielberg classic.  For one of the first times, dinosaurs look real.  Mixing animatronics and CGI every carnivore is menacing as hell.  The opening sequence will definitely get your attention and once everyone reaches the island, the suspense is sustained.<br /><br />Adapted from Michael Crichton's bestselling novel, multi-millionaire John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) has created a theme park on an island near Costa Rica unlike any other.  He and his scientists have found a way to clone extinct plants and animal DNA using blood from mosquitoes captured in amber millions of years ago.  He brings dino-diggers Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) and mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to the island to help him convince his investors represented by attorney Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) that the idea is solid and that is successfully nearing completion.<br /><br />Several monkey-wrenches are thrown into the mix to put everyone at risk from the meat eaters.  To complicate matters further Hammond's 2 spunky grandchildren are along for the ride adding a different element of risk.<br /><br />For those who have a decent home theater, I would urge you to watch this on a Blu ray disc.  It is only available as of this writing as part of the "Ultimate Collection."  It will give the dinosaur's roar and foot stomps the proper treatment, not to mention a beautiful picture.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Charge!"></head><body><p>I went into this movie cold.  I had no idea who "The Rock" was (I'd read about him, but somehow did not connect him with this film) I did not know "The Scorpion King" was supposed to be a prequel of the Mummy movies, neither of which I had seen.  So me and my popcorn had a clear, unbiased mind.<p>The setting is long, long ago.  Gommorah is still in business and gunpowder has yet to be invented.  Arkkadian Assassin Mathayus (the Rock) has been hired to kill a sorcerer whose predictions are far too dependable. Mathayus' brother is tortured to death, and he vows revenge. When he discovers the sorcerer is a gorgeous young lady in a harem costume, he "liberates" her.  His steed is a camel, the odds against him are never less than 50 to 1, and he lays them out like dominoes. After 90 minutes of mayhem, the good guys win the kingdom, the castle and the babe.<p>Dwayne Johnson was a charmer in this potboiler.  He has almost too good a sense of humor (I thought he was going to crack up a few times over his ridiculous lines. Shades of Crosby and Hope in a "Road" picture!) His face is expressive, his movements agile, and he is definitely eye candy.  I wish him well in a movie career.  I think he would be a fine action hero.  I felt sorry for his sidekick, Philos (Bernard Hill).  The script was so bad that the feeble jokes he was forced to utter wouldn't get a giggle out of a pre-schooler.  With the exception of a few reprehensible villains and mighty Balthazar (Michael Clarke Duncan), the cast was uniformly beautiful right down to the starving children. <p>The action is non-stop, so time passes quickly and all in all, I had a good time. "The Scorpion King" makes a good non-think rental.  Laugh along with The Rock.<br />-sweetmolly-Amazon.com Reviewer</p></body></html>

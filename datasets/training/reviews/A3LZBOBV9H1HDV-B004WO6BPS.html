This is how the story goes: Harry, Ron and Hermione set out on their perilous mission to track down and destroy the secret to Voldemort's immortality and destruction -- the Horcruxes. On their own, without the guidance of their professors or the protection of Professor Dumbledore, the three friends must now rely on one another more than ever. But there are Dark Forces in their midst that threaten to tear them apart. Meanwhile, the wizarding world has become a dangerous place for all enemies of the Dark Lord. The long-feared war has begun and Voldemort's Death Eaters seize control of the Ministry of Magic and even Hogwarts, terrorizing and arresting anyone who might oppose them. But the one prize they still seek is the one most valuable to Voldemort: Harry Potter. The Chosen One has become the hunted one as the Death Eaters search for Harry with orders to bring him to Voldemort...alive. Harry's only hope is to find the Horcruxes before Voldemort finds him. But as he searches for clues, he uncovers an old and almost forgotten tale -- the legend of the Deathly Hallows. And if the legend turns out to be true, it could give Voldemort the ultimate power he seeks. Little does Harry know that his future has already been decided by his past when, on that fateful day, he became "the Boy Who Lived." No longer just a boy, Harry Potter is drawing ever closer to the task for which he has been preparing since the day he first stepped into Hogwarts: the ultimate battle with Voldemort.<br /><br />The cast led by Daniel Radcliffe (as Harry Potter), Rupert Grint (as Ron Weasley) & Emma Watson (as Hermione Granger) is excellent!

Rowling's novel) by Steve Kloves (who also did the screenplay to "Wonder Boys" (2000) & the screenplays to all, but one of, the Harry Potter films) is excellent!<br /><br />The music by Alexandre Desplat (who also did the music, recently to, "The Ghost Writer" (2010), "Tamara Drewe" (2010), "The King's Speech" (2010) & the upcoming "The Tree Of Life" (2011) is excellent!

Raimi has changed the rules a bit from the first film in this one, but kept Ash, leading to the viewer's almost constant confusion.<br /><br />In this episode, Ash and his girlfriend Linda (Denise Bixler) head up to the cabin that everyone (except, it seems, Ash) remembers from the original film. Ash discovers the book and the tape player, which again, everyone (except, it seems, Ash) will remember, and does exactly what he shouldn't do. With the expected consequences.<br /><br />Intercut with this are scenes of Annie (Sarah Berry, who would later surface in the lovely CHUD II), the daughter of the guy reading the passages aloud on the tape, who has a vapid boyfriend, a need to get to the cabin, and the other pages of the book, which (conveniently) contain the spell to send the evil back where it came from. Of course, we end up with everyone at the cabin, waiting to become zombie food.<br /><br />Dead By Dawn is by far the weakest of the three Evil Dead movies, but it's got its own charm; it's kind of The Evil Dead Meet the Three Stooges. It alternates between awful and hysterical. And it didn't have to be awful; it was immediately obvious from the first half-hour of The Evil Dead that Sam Raimi knew a camera lens from a plate of spaghetti, but either a good deal of the comedy here falls flat, or Raimi did portions of this film as a rush job (a quick skim of the list of goofs at IMDB gives the latter impression). It's also, obviously, meant as (perhaps its primary reason for being was) setup for Army of Darkness, a far superior film, and it has a great deal of archival value based on that. But as a standalone film, it's not all that great. ** ?</p></body></html>

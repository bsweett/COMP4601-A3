<meta name="summary" content="X-tremely Good Film"></head><body><p>The movie was a good one, with plenty of interesting characters based off the comics and lots of great action scenes. Some good one-liners as well, and it is an overall good film in its own right. I think that we will see a Star Trek- or Superman-like franchise before long though, with lots of films gradually declining in quality, but the first one was great anyway.</p></body></html>

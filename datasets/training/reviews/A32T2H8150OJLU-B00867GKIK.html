<meta name="summary" content="Pixar still at the top of its game!  UP is a 5-star film through and through"></head><body><p>I've seen this movie three times now, at intervals from the release last summer through last Tues night, and "UP" gets better every time I see it.  There are both overt and subtle funny bits galore!<br /><br />Pixar lives up to its amazingly high standards of quality of animation AND storytelling in this far-fetched, yet overwhelmingly fun film.<br /><br />If you are like me you don't often laugh out loud while you watch movies, but I did frequently during this show.  The devotion of the now cranky old man to his wife's memory and a promise he made her drives the storyline, while the "small mailman" (boy scoutish) child provides a solid helping of comic relief.<br /><br />You will come to love lines like: "SQUIRREL!", "I just met you and I love you!", "Oh, it's before!", and many more.<br /><br />If you are a fan of other Pixar films you will certainly enjoy this one too.  I'd say that it's as good as any of the other Pixar movies that have been released.  I think that the thing that makes them great is that the folks at Pixar are able to take the humor in everyday life and place it in incredibly unlikely situations.  Pixars stories also grasp our imaginations today the same way that movie serials and Buck Rogers did for members of previous generations.<br /><br />Thanks for another top-notch film.  May you continue doing so for decades to come!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="tim burtons take on washington irving loses its sizzle as it goes along"></head><body><p>while i thoroughly enjoyed the opening hour of this tim burton / johnny depp collaboration, it loses all its energy in its secind half. as always, its visually interesting but the plotline falls back upon the revenge destroys cliche. it will be interesting to see just what this director & frequent muse wreak upon their upcoming project, the ULTIMATE revenge meditation: sondheims "sweeney todd".</p></body></html>

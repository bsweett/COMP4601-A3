It was slow-moving, and after about an hour, it was established that this guy was having a tough time. One thing we noticed was the sensitivity and unconditional love for his son, and his very common sense approach to life at large without crippling the son's mind for life. The screenwriters are to be commended for adapting Chris  Gardner's auto-biography in a direct, matter-of-fact way. I thought the pairing of Mr. Smith and his son, Jaden, was fine (unlike others' opinions). I also thought that Thandie Newton played the wife with the utmost despair, a frustration that she simply couldn't deal with. I would like to know what ultimately happened to her, as well as the young son, now in his late 20's. The DVD had some good extras, especially about Mr. Gardner and his in-put during filming. My favorite element of the film is that it involved very little racism. Mr. Gardner never complained that his bad luck was due to "being Black", and instead used his wit, wisdom and intelligence to make a seemingly hopeless stuation work to his ultimate advantage. He's a fine role model for ALL people who think they're at the rope's end. It CAN be done, as Mr. Gardner proved, and there are valuable lessons here, for those who take the time to let them soak in. Indeed, the slow pace is deliberate, thanks to director Gabrielle Meccino. I think it was the bottom-line idea... watch, listen, learn, grow...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Did It Completely Suck?"></head><body><p>"Aeon Flux" could have been so much that the movie was not, but I wonder if the movie really sucked as bad as some would say. Was it a classic sci-fi in the league of "Star Wars", "The Matrix" or others? No. On the other hand, it was not that bad either, to be honest.<br /><br />The premise is that about 99% of all humanity has been wiped out in a great plague and that there is only one city left: Bregna. In Bregna, people live in a healthy, utopian dream and they never venture outside the walls. The city is ruled by one family, the Goodchilds, who rule in benevolent guidance and look after everyone. Or so it seems. The Monicans are the resistance to the Goodchilds and work acts of violence and destruction.<br /><br />This movie has some definite things going for it, besides Charlize Theron in some very revealing clothing. The action sequences are excellent, and they are of the highest quality. On this basis alone, "Aeon Flux" could hold its own against most other films with fight sequences in them. The action is also fairly high paced, with few periods of dry or dull monotony.<br /><br />The special effects are also excellently executed, and worth a look. The creativity of different weapons and gadgets would satisfy most Trekkies, I think. The advanced technology portrayed was not so different from our own time, with some recognisable items there. However, it was different enough to give you something of the unreal and dreamlike.<br /><br />The striking thing for this viewer was the contrast between the frenetic intensity of the Monicans with their drive to rebel, and the mindless acceptance of everything by the majority of the population. Later in the movie, even this contrast is shattered when Aeon Flux starts to question the mission that she is sent on by the Monican Handler. Black and white/Them and us start to take on a more blurred aspect, complicating a simple dichotomy of friend and foe. The movie succeeds in raising some issues for thought.<br /><br />I thought the ending was a bit simplistic and corny. If I had a criticism of the movie, that would be it. I was left feeling a little less than satisfied with the way that the movie resolved itself. However, taken overall, I would have to say that this is more than counterbalanced by the earlier parts of the movie.<br /><br />In short, be cautious if you are buying it, I would not watch it a lot of times, but it is worth a couple of viewings, at least. I would not be shy on the hiring side of it, and see what you think. It may not be your thing, but I definitely enjoyed it.</p></body></html>

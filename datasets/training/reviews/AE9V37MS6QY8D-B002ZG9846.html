Don't get me wrong, Iron Man 2 is a VERY close second, but "Kick-Ass" bests it simply because of its ability to be both serious and laugh at itself (not taking itself too seriously); in other words, what all Marvel movies try to do, but usually fail.<br /><br />In Alan Moore's masterpiece graphic novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401219268">Watchmen</a>, Hollis Mason (the original Nite Owl) stated that the reason people started dressing up as costumed crimefighters was because of the criminals dressing in themed costumes, hence the superhero was born. In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GZ6QEC">The Dark Knight (+ BD Live) [Blu-ray</a>] film, Heath Ledger's Joker menacingly taunts Batman, stating: "Those mob fools want you gone so they can get back to the way things were. But I know the truth: there's no going back. You've changed things... forever." And from there, we know that Batman has inspired this new cache of supervillains in his world. Well, it's with that same inspiration that a lonely teenager Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) asks, "How come nobody's ever tried to be a superhero?" From there begins a realistic, violent-yet-comic story of his attempt to become just that: a superhero called Kick-Ass.<br /><br />What starts off as "Kick-Ass" just trying to clean up the streets becomes a tale of a scared kid who's in above his head as he tries to avoid getting caught in the crosshairs of every hitman's gun under the orders of a mob boss (Mark Strong). Fumbling his way through his crimefighting career, Lizewski crosses paths with Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) and Hit-Girl (the EXCELLENT Chloe Moretz), other vigilante crimefighters who make him look like what he is: an amateur. Along the way, he also meets a friend (similar to James Franco's Harry Osborn in the Spider-Man films), Chris D'Amico (Superbad's Christopher Mintz-Plasse), and further develops his crush on Katie Deauxma (Lyndsy Fonseca).<br /><br />There's been plenty of criticism about the film since it's release having to do with the supposed insult of Lizewski's dad being afraid that his son was gay; because that would be such a bad thing for a father to have to face (and yes, I'm being sarcastic with that statement). And the idea of Chloe Moretz's Hit-Girl being seen as a sex symbol as some moviegoers repeat a statement one of the characters, seeing her in action, declares, "I think I'm in love with her!" The "gay controversy" was reported by Entertainment Weekly. First of all, let's get this straightened out, Lizewski's dad in the film is scared by the idea that his son was prostituting himself, stripped naked and robbed ... not the mere fact that he was gay. Second, there will be boys who find Hit-Girl's dominating action as a turn-on, and that is disturbing, given her age (11-years-old). But, being as I'm not someone who views that as "hot," but rather just as really cool, that aspect therefore doesn't enter my mind and doesn't affect the quality of the movie in the slightest. To all the naysayers, I say, "Lighten up." It's a film about a kid who poses as a superhero. It's to be taken with a grain of salt. Besides, would there be so much "controversy" if it were a boy who was kicking ass and shooting guns and cussing like a sailor? Also, in a world where there are very few young female crimefighters, Hit-Girl -- despite her age -- could be seen as a role model. She's tough, independent and completely confident. But more on her in a second.<br /><br />Nevertheless, there are true themes of morality that pepper the story of Kick-Ass. The ever-present theme of "With great power, comes great responsibility" is tackled in various incarnations throughout. Let's revisit Hit-Girl and her double life. Damon Macready/Big Daddy's (Cage) quest for revenge on the death of his wife and the pathologically violent path it's taken his daughter Mindy Macready (Moretz) down is explored with great depth, as is the hazard of posing as a crimefighter/policeman/detective/etc. in a job that is extremely dangerous. The violence is plentiful and stylized as much as it is brutal and unforgiving. The question of a little girl crimefighter/vigilante is not "Does she have the right?" but rather is, "Should a little girl of eleven-years-old be subjected to such violence?" Well, first of all, again, it's a movie based on a comic book so it's whatever the writers want it to be. Secondly, if this were the real world (and being a father of two daughters), then no, she shouldn't be raised in such a matter. And the end of the film comes up with a way to address this issue. Either way, with the movies Moretz has been involved with (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UV4XUQ">(500) Days of Summer [Blu-ray] with Digital Copy</a> and the upcoming U.S. remake of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MYIXAW">Let the Right One In [Blu-ray</a>] entitled "Let Me In"), she shows great potential as an actress.<br /><br />Overall, "Kick-Ass" is a fun film! It's got very adult situations (violence, language and a quicky sex scene thrown in for good measure), but from its dark humor beginning to its sequel-potential ending, Matthew Vaughn's adaptation of Mark Millar's (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1582404976">Wanted</a>) comic hits all the right chords. I was skeptical about Mintz-Plasse's portrayal of Red Mist, but he surprisingly played the part convincingly and believably. For fans of the comic who read the comic before seeing the movie (as I did), there are slight differences near the end -- that I can only think for the reason of satisfying the moviegoing masses -- that were changed. However, these changes don't greatly alter the quality of the story. It's been said there will already be a sequel based on Millar's second half of the comic series tentatively called "Balls to the Wall." Unfortunately, Millar won't be releasing that series for at least another year or so. Until then, the DVD release of "Kick-Ass" will have to suffice!</p></body></html>

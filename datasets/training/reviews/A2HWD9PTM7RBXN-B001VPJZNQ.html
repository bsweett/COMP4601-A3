The Rock(Dwayne Johnson) does add some charisma to the screen with his glib style.  Sean William Scott and Christopher Walken are fine in supporting roles.<p>However the story line is really nothing special.  It certainly lacks depth and basically was written as a vehicle for The Rock to show if his wrestling moves and stunt man abilities.  There are other action thrillers that succede on both levels(story and action).  Just check out anything by Denzel Washington or even Arnold Schwartzenegger.<p>The Rundown does feature some comedic moments and some good action scenes.  However, the story is middle of the road at best.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Could Have Been Much Better"></head><body><p>I enjoyed the other two films in this series to some extent, and I even liked this one quite a bit, but the dialogue and lack of plot were beyond bad. Milla was hot and fun to watch as always, but everyone else I could care less about. The storyline didn't really progress much and it looks like the fourth film in the series will be on its way in a couple of years. Not bad, but worth waiting to rent on DVD.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An excellent movie carried by an excellent performance"></head><body><p>Wow! What a movie! I was nervous about this movie, because I thought it might be too much for me. Well, I finally saw it. It was very disturbing and moving and is a masterpiece. The movie is excellent with powerful performances notably by Edward Norton. Where's his oscar? Why'd Roberto Benigni get it? Edward was robbed!<br /><br />The movie is very powerful and moving and has a very sad and tragic ending. The movie is so sad because it is depicting reality. The watcher sees these skinheads and how awful they are. But, then you think about some of Edward Norton's statements and how they're maybe true. This makes you think a lot. The movie is about the leader of the skinheads, Derek (Edward Norton) who is sent to jail for killing some black guys trying to steal his car. His brother Donny (Edward Furlong) is headed down the same path as Derek but once Derek is released, he is a changed man. He feels bad for what he has done and wants to change. But his brother is confused and the skinheads aern't happy with their ex leader. The movie is so powerful and moving and shows the remarquable transformation of a mean and angry man into a kind and caring man.<br /><br />This movie is one of my favorites ever and I recommend it to everyone. It's not for light hearted people but this needs to be seen. This is an amazing movie that EVERYONE should see. You'll cry, turn your head away in disgust and might even get 1 or 2 laughs.</p></body></html>

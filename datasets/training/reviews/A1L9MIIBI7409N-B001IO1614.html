<meta name="summary" content="SURPRISINGLY GOOD"></head><body><p>This was the first Bond movie I hadn't seen on the big screen (since watching Roger Moore as The Spy Who Loved Me back in the 70s).  I'd been disenchanted by the last two Bond outings: Tomorrow Never Dies and The World is Not Enough...<p>Pierce B was better than Tim Dalton but the scripts and direction were incredibly weak in previous films.  Not to mention boring bad guys.<p>Die Another Day is a return to form.  If it's going to be Brosnan's last turn as Bond, I'll miss him.  Great script, big sets, riveting action and good direction from Lee Tamahori.  This is the most interesting Bond film since Goldeneye.  <p>Worth watching and I haven't even seen the extras yet...</p></body></html>

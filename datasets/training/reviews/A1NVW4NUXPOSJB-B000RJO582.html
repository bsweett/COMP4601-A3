<meta name="summary" content="A good remake."></head><body><p>I was curious to see it. Texas Chainsaw Massacre the remake was a great surprise so why not? with the progress made in SFX nowadays, I was thinking, it'll be bloody! I confirm. Dawn Of the Dead the remake is a cool movie. The original version was my fave Zombie movie so I came with the eye of a critic. There's no big difference with the original, the story is quite the same except the end going further.<br />If I remember, the original end, was the two last survivors leaving the mall with an helicoptere. Here they leave on a different way but well, it's cool and well done.<br />The only negative points...<br />1/ The teenager girl who leaves the mall to drive a truck (Yes, she knows how to drive a truck...cool), and crushes hundred of zombies ( yes, she's not scared...cool) to save a dog (yes, she really loves animals to death...cool)<br />2/ When they get to the Marina, they know everything about the boat. They know how it looks and find it right away. Otherwise, they know how to navigate it. You'll understand what I mean.<br />3/ A pity there are not those bad Hell's angels coming over the mall and bring some more massacres..For those who saw the original, they will know what I'm talking about.<p>About the SFX and visual effects, of course they're bloody great. Of course the dialogue is sometimes a bit cheezy and some of the characters a bit ridiculous but well...<br />100 times or more better than the "28 days later" treating the same subject, Dawn of the dead is sick, bloody and I really enjoyed...I believe a sequel will come to light in the following years...when dead have no room left in Hell certainly.</p></body></html>

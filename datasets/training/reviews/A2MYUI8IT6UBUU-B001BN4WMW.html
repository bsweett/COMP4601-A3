<meta name="summary" content="Braveheart Movie Review"></head><body><p>A cinematic masterpiece of epic proportions, Mel Gibson's Braveheart easily competes with the classic historical epics of cinema including Ben-Hur and Spartacus, as well as recent blockbusters such as Gladiator. It is a film that encompasses all of the finest methods of filmmaking, and never fails to present a passionate and powerful story above its other movie-making feats. Awe-inspiring, brutal and action-packed, Braveheart makes no mistakes in its storytelling process and includes some of the most memorable and adrenaline-rushing sequences in recent memory.<br /><br />In 1280 Scotland, young William Wallace learns the hardships of life as reining King Edward the Longshanks claims the Scottish throne for himself and lays down a strict and merciless rule. When a group of noblemen go to negotiate with the local lords, they are slaughtered by order of the king, and William's father dies in the ensuing fight. Wallace (Mel Gibson) leaves for a time to study in neighboring countries and to gain skills in fighting, even though he hopes to come home to raise a family and crops. Upon his return, he secretly marries his childhood sweetheart Murron (Catherine McCormack); secrecy is needed due to the king's reinstatement of Prima Nocta, a law that allows the lord of the land to spend the first night with every newlywed bride. When Murron is attacked by English soldiers, Wallace assaults them, which leads to his wife being slain by the governing magistrate. In a fit of rage and revenge, he overthrows the English soldiers in his village, kills the magistrate, and begins gathering troops to take back control of Scotland.<br /><br />It comes as a shock to me that Mel Gibson wasn't even nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of William Wallace, which is a fantastic role, adding elements of Mad Max and Martin Riggs peeking through the believable Scottish accent. All of the roles are well developed and enjoyable, from the miserly King Edward to madman Stephen to Angus Macfadyen's Robert the Bruce. Powerful performances all around boost the epic feel and thrilling action in this historical tale of bravery and courage.<br /><br />The scene following Murron's early death is perhaps the finest of the film, showing such passion, excitement and white-knuckle thrills like few films of our time. Filmed nearly all in slow motion, with powerful glances and violent bravado, Wallace takes his revenge on the English lord and begins the campaign to free Scotland from England's tyranny. The action sequences that follow, including the colossal battle scenes, are bloody and grand, and Braveheart quickly became known for its large-scale realistic battles. Displaying plenty of blood and gore, the elephantine battles are breathtaking and complex, and foreshadow Gibson's steadily developing bloodthirstiness for authenticity. Braveheart's torture sequence near the conclusion is also masterfully executed, careful to show audiences just enough to leave the imagination to solve the rest.<br /><br />At its heart, Braveheart is an eternal love story, for Wallace is pushed to fight for revenge, and later continues to sacrifice and struggle for the moments in his dreams that he can be momentarily reunited with his true love. "Every man dies", he tells the Princess of Wales (Sophie Marceau), who sympathizes with his cause and admires his bravery. "Not every man really lives." Betrayal, retribution, crafty counterplay and untouchable courage all abound in this winner of five Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director for Mel Gibson. Braveheart is a masterpiece in storytelling and visuals and one of the greatest of all historical epics.<br /><br />- Mike Massie</p></body></html>

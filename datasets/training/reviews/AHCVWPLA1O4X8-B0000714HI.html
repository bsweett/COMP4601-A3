<meta name="summary" content="Austin Powers still has it (for the most part)"></head><body><p>This is the third installment in the Austin Powers series, and the first two were absolutely hilarious.  This one doesn't quite live up to its predecessors, but it's good nonetheless.  This movie finds Austin up against a new villian, Goldmember, and introduces several new characters, including Austin's father (a great performance by Michael Caine). <p>For the most part, this film is very funny.  If you like the crazy, unpredictable capers of the other two films you're bound to enjoy this one, too.  There are even a couple of twists in the plot to keep it interesting.<p>I really liked this movie, but there are two objections I had to it.  First, I don't like the character of Foxxy Cleopatra.  There just wasn't any chemistry there.  Second, I think some of the jokes are getting a little bit old (like Dr. Evil asking for ransom money and telling Scott to shut up).  Still, I think this movie is worthwhile, and would definitely recommend it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="More Fun than a Barrel of Horned-up Monkeys"></head><body><p>My review title somewhat summarizes the mentality of this film...note that I did enjoy "The Rundown" (halfway through I recalled having already seen it) and I could watch it again in the future. There's a lot of action and some really stunning jungle backdrops along with some incredible mountainous vistas...a fun movie for the entire [13yr+] family!<br /><br />The HD transfer looks excellent and the DD+ 5.1 audio "rocks"!<br /><br />I recommend "The Rundown" to anyone who would enjoy a little bit of toilet humor mixed in with some priceless artifact seeking adventure and a whole lot of explosions. Beck (The Rock) doesn't like guns, though...well you'll just have to see how that turns out.<br /><br />Great fun for almost anyone! Perhaps not so much for Mom...but you never know.</p></body></html>

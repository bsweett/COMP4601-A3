The film is dark and the action sequences are terribly frustrating as you can't see what's going on. I watched it with every light out in my living room and only my kitchen light as backlighting and it was torture. But I was determined to tough it out in order to witness the final battle between the Predator/Alien hybrid and the Predator warrior. I could barely see what was going on. Even the daylight scenes are strangely dark, like a filter was used. Other than that, the film is OK, but not terribly well written. The war vet heroine does a fair imitation of Sigourney Weaver. There are moments of homage to both the Alien and Predator films and the end of the movie is a rip-off of Terminator. The basic plot is that the Predator ship containing the hybrid and alot of facehuggers crashes on Earth, they all get loose and attack a small town. A Predator warrior comes to Earth to destroy them and spends most of his time pouring acid on their victims to eliminate all traces of the Aliens. The US government gets wind of all this and (spoiler alert) nukes the town. There's a lot of screaming in the dark. And that's about it. Oh, and there's an annoying cameo by the actor who plays the medical examiner in CSI-NY which is very distracting. This film is not recommended even for hardcore Alien and Predator fans.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An amazing, epic film!"></head><body><p>I came into "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" knowing it was a martial-arts fantasy (as if people actually could run up walls and skip among bamboo trees), and was not disappointed in the least.  The story itself was a little hard to explain to others who hadn't seen it, but as it breaks down, two warriors and close friends (the always cool Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh) hunt down a thief (Zhang Ziyi) who may be the student of one of their oldest enemies.  Suffice to say, things get complicated from there.  Although this is technically the middle story in the series of books from which it's based (hopefully, those rumors of a prequel will come to pass), I managed to follow the story easily and have to admit it had a lot more characterization than I came to expect in other martial-arts epics (not that I have a problem with films where I have to turn my brain off, mind you).  The action sequences in this film border on stunning (the woman-to-woman fight in the dojo definitely ranks up there as one of my favorite action scenes ever), and the photography (definitely worth winning an Oscar for) was nothing less than beautiful.  Even though the ending itself appears to be open to a lot of interpretation, I have to admit this is one of those epics that doesn't insult my intelligence (although I have to admit clich&eacute;d lines like "You will pay for my master's death" and so forth did give me a slight chuckle upon hearing them) and manages to be quite intoxicating.  This is truly a great dramatic opera, and like all great movies, is definitely worth revisiting again and again.</p></body></html>

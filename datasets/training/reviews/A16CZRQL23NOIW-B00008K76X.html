<meta name="summary" content="Watchable film!"></head><body><p>Tom Clancy best seller is well filmed with towering locations and a cast with peaks and lows .<br /><br />The script lacks of dramatic continuity and in more than once it tends to fall in common grounds .<br /><br />Watch for instance Seven days in May and you will know whayt I mean .<br /><br />The plot in question well deserved a deeper gaze for the multiple aspects considered .<br /><br />But nevertheless it is a worthable work even it will not become a masterpiece or a cult movie in the future .<br /><br />Affleck is charismatic and emerges as the substitute of Kevin Costner ten years ago and Keanu Reeves five years ago , but its performance lacks deepness, its role is too predictable and besides he is quite expressionless from beginning to end and the lines for his character certainly do not help him at all .</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the Best Western Films Ever Made"></head><body><p>"Unforgiven" took home 4 Acadmemy Awards back in 1992, is number 98 on The American Film Institute's Top 100, and is a milestone in western cinema. It's also directed by two-time Oscar Winner Clint Eastwood<br /><br />(Best Director, "Unforgiven" & "Million Dollar Baby"), who also stars.<br /><br />It also features two-time Oscar winner Gene Hackman (Best Actor, "The French Connection" and Best Supporting Actor, "Unforgiven") and<br /><br />Oscar winner Morgan Freeman (Best Supporting Actor, "Million Dollar Baby"). I've never been a big fan of westerns and never really had a desire to see this movie, until I got into the HBO show "Deadwood" which made me want to look back at some western films. Well, "Unforgiven" is a masterpiece on many levels...Not just as a western. As scripted by David Webb Peoples, "Unforgiven" opens as two men viciously cut a prostitute's face with a knife in the town of Big Whiskey. When the sheriff, Little Bill Dagget (Hackman) shows up he hands down their punishment. Give the owner of the house a few horses. Outraged, the prostitutes begin to offer men $1000 dollars to kill the men who did it. Jump over to Kansas and we meet Bill Munney (Eastwood, in one of his best performances), a former outlaw, who has changed his ways since getting married. But, now, his wife is dead and he's left with his two young children. One day, a kid (about 20) shows up at his house identifying himself as The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett). The Kid tells Bill about the prostitute's offer and asks Bill to be his partner; Bill quickly turns him down, but eventually changes his mind and rides out into the country to catch up with the Kid. Along the way, Bill stops at his old friend Ned's (Freeman) place and Ned joins him. The late Richard Harris co-stars as a killer-for-hire named English Bob, who's character pretty much could've been erased. Anyway, this movie is probably my third favorite film directed by Eastwood; It's right below Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby. This movie is entertaining, dramatic, and features Eastwood, Freeman, and Hackman giving some of the best performances of their careers. The chances of someone being disappointed with a film like this are very slim; this is just really one of the great movies of the last 20 years.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></body></html>

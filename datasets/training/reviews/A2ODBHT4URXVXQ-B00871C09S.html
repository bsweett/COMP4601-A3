<meta name="summary" content="A Hitchcock classic"></head><body><p>This old classic (with photographer James Stewart confined to his apartment with a cast on his leg and his girlfriend Grace Kelly providing legs for their sleuthing) never fails to satisfy. And it's really, really scary, especially the scene where the suspected murderer (Raymond Burr with menacing gaze and heavy brow) sees Kelly twiddling her finger behind her back, glances out the window and up, up, up to where Stewart is framed in his apartment window across the courtyard. Ridiculous, but even as I type this, I'm getting goosebumps.<br />The beauty of this film is the way it plays on the role of the voyeur. Stewart amuses himself by spying on his neighbors in the apartment buildings that surround his Greenwich Village courtyard - and we, the viewing audience, get to peek over his shoulder. It's incredibly titillating - until Burr's invalid wife goes missing.<br />Terrific cure for boredom, both Stewart's and ours, especially with the truly terrifying conclusion.</p></body></html>

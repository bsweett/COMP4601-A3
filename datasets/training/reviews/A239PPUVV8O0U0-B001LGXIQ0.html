<meta name="summary" content="The Old TV-To-Film Trick. Doesn't Work Every Time But It Did For This"></head><body><p>Yay! My 100th review. Now that that's done; I couldn't imagine Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway in an action film but they pulled it off well. Nobody can top what Adams, Feldon, Platt, Kopell, etc. did in the series and the actors in this don't rip off their interpretations or belittle what they had done. Carell plays Max with a deadpan wit, which I enjoy, compared to Adams' nasily voice which defined the character back in the 60s and it still does now. Hathaway is the accomplished agent who doesn't even tolerate Max until the end while Feldon immediately fell in love with him. Platt's Chief grew exasperated with Max's antics while Arkin's actually admired Max's talent. And Kopell (who makes a cameo) used a thick German accent while Terence Stamp is an English actor who plays Seigfreid with a bit more menace. The references to the series are excellent from Max's catchphrase to the shoe-phone. Even the three cars Adams drove in the opening credits are featured. The plot is a little cliched (drawing comparisons from how Steve Martin's Clouseau gets humiliated only to be redeemed in the end) and some twists aren't that surprising but it doesn't stop this from being funny and exciting. The gags and jokes are clever (this being one of few comedies I've seen in theatres and the whole audience was laughing) but the vomit joke was disgusting and not remotely funny. The action sequences were executed well, some scenes being homages to the Bond films (the original series being a spoof of them) such as the free fall fight sequence with Dalip (who reminds me a little of Richard Keil's Jaws and Kabir Bedi's Gobinda) from Moonraker. Trevor Rabin's score is excellent and I love the reorchestrated TV theme.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Fall Of The Penguins Is Also Entertaining"></head><body><p>Slipping and falling on the ice is a perennial, a gag that never fails. True for people, true for penguins.<br /><br />This is a stunning movie, the story and footage are almost beyond belief. But it would have been just as good, maybe better, with no editing and no narration. Penguins are cute beyond all reason, and instead of playing against this conception to reveal the drama, the film makers, and especially narrator, reinforce it.<br /><br />This is arguably the most G-Rated, sanitized presentation of Darwinian cruelty and suffering ever created; with the exception of a few brief revelations you might think these penguins were on a hayride in Vermont. Humanity's devastation of our planet is almost complete, there are few wild places left. An intimate visit to such a truly remote and inhospitable place is fascinating, and brilliantly executed here.<br /><br />However, in their effort to create a film that was "family-friendly" the film makers forgot to point out that they were documenting the process of evolution in its most bizarre and merciless incarnation.</p></body></html>

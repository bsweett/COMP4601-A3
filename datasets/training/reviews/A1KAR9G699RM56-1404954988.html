<meta name="summary" content="Mas o menos bien, more or less entertaining..."></head><body><p>Spanglish is about a life-shaping incident in the life of one Hispanic girl, where her mom goes to work, and temporarily lives with the American family.  The family that they are saying with though is rather dysfunctional though, and the narrator's mother's Hispanic heritage adds just another difficulty to this already hectic family life.<br /><br />Overall this movie was okay, and, for those readers, rather reminiscent of Sandra Cisnero's novels.  Overall, there is a touch of dysfunction, a touch of Hispanic American culture clash, and a touch of romance.<br /><br />The only reason this was not too pleasurable was that the sub-plots took too long to interconnect.  Whether it was Adam Sandler's (American dad) family or the Hispanic family the movie was about their troubles but there was nothing being accomplished.<br /><br />Like I said though, overall it was ok and Adam Sandler played a particularly strong role as the chef/father/nucleus of the hectic family unit.  Check it out for a simple yet slightly deep film, temporary amusement if nothing else.</p></body></html>

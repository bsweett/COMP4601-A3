<meta name="summary" content="Not bad"></head><body><p>I saw bits and pieces of this movie on HBO now and again. Couldn't wait to watch it from beginning till the end..... once I received it from Amazon. I watched it with my hubby. Neither one of us watched it from the beginning till the end before. All I can say about this movie is it is gross...lol. But that's not a bad thing to me. It kind if reminds me of Fright Night, because of the way the Vampires look when they transform. This movie is not for everyone. You might want to rent it first.</p></body></html>

I already commented on the film, but I got the DVD and wanted to give my opinion of it.<p>The new scenes are interesting, though it would have been better if they have been trasfered them into the movie smoothly, the loading thing is a bit odd. And scenes are repeated, I guess more thought could have gone into that whole option, ya know? But none the less, I prefer to see the movie normally. The secrets are neat  (Hint:Find a Rose and Dog Tag that will lead you to some goodies in the Art Gallery, And Trailer pages) <p> The trailers and tv spots are are good. Minus the very first tease trailer. (Poo!)  The movie looks great, the sound is great, and the animated menus are cool, but once again COULD have been cooler.<p>Ya can't complain, its a nice package. The cover art, and metallic case are fun to look at. <p>The features are neat, but the film is what will keep you turning this Disc in your player.</p></body></html>

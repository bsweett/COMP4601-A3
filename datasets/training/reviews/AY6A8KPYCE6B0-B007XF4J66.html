<meta name="summary" content="Here's Looking at Blu, Kid"></head><body><p>Perhaps not in all of cinema's history has there been a movie with such brilliant writing, scoring, acting, and numbers of emotional close ups.<br /><br />Casablanca is a legend of nearly 70 years, but thanks to Blu Ray technology it doesn't have to feel that way.  Watching this classic in 1080p is truly an experience, and I have to praise Warner for providing us with the absolutely best possible transfer this film has ever seen.  There's not a trace of grain or flicker or anything you'd expect from a film this old, and the result is stunning.  If you've seen the movie before, it's time to relive with this remarkable new technology.  If you've somehow missed it on TCM, get cultured and experience one of the greatest films in our history in a way no generation has ever been able to do.  Blu Ray.  It not only improves the viewing experience, but it invites the viewer right into the moment.  With clarity as perfect as this, you forget you're even watching a film and instead feel as though you've tapped into the memories of the characters portrayed.<br /><br />I don't feel the need to mention the movie's plot, as most I'm guessing have either already seen it before or can find that out elsewhere, so I want to end this review with what you are probably most wondering about anyway.  Is the Blu Ray transfer worth buying this for?  If I haven't made it clear enough already, YES.  I've seen some poor Blu Rays transfers, but this is not one of them.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say it's one of the best I've seen.  The extras, though I haven't experienced them yet, look interesting, including an audio commentary by movie critic Roger Ebert.  All in all I'd say that this release is definitely worth getting even if Casablanca isn't your favorite movie of all time.  It is a classic, and it is an experience, and with Blu Ray it's better than ever before.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Silicon Valley Exposed"></head><body><p>Office Space is one of those rare movies that aren't a big hit, but established itself as an instant cult classic simply by being `almost' a documentary.  I won't give away anything that you can't read in the Amazon Editorial, but the characters are so `clinically clich&eacute;' in a hilarious way.  You will recognize a person from your office in every scene and if you aren't seething with hate, you'll definitely be laughing hysterically.  The guys who scheme the money laundering are truly clever and the boss is truly an inspired piece of irritating nonsense.  Only the girlfriend lacks any comedic fashion other than the workplace she inhabits - a `Chili's' style restaurant nightmarishly funny in itself.  There are some fairly clever sight gags throughout the movie that just keep your interest on a constant level.  I won't say it's a fantastic film, but I sure as heck wasn't bored and found a lot of true, funny events to ponder.  If this film is worth anything at all, it's the character, "Milton", an overweight, coke-bottled glass wearing, wimpy do-nothing that cannot find his stapler.  He turns out to be the unlikeliest of heroes.<br /><br />The DVD extras are especially inspired pieces of humor and not at all wasteful like most.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not quite devilish enough"></head><body><p>"The Devil Wears Prada" is based on Lauren Weisberger's bestselling novel about a nice, ordinary young girl who experiences a drastic reality check when she takes a job with a large fashion magazine in New York City. Andrea Sachs (Anne Hathaway) always dreamed of becoming a writer, but the only job she manages to land is a position at Runway magazine working as the second assistant to the editor-in-chief. To say that Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) is an extremely difficult boss would be an understatement. She is cold, condescending, relentless, and impossibly demanding. Miranda can't understand why Andrea is unable to book her on a flight out of Miami even though the city is at the mercy of a hurricane and no flights are being allowed to take off. She also has no problem insisting that Andrea track down two copies of the new and UNPUBLISHED Harry Potter book...what's so hard about that?! Andrea soon learns that working for Miranda is a full-time job. Her phone is constantly ringing with Miranda-related emergencies, and Andrea's relationship with her boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier) begins to suffer as a result.<br /><br />Needless to say, working for Miranda turns Andrea's life upside down. Not only is she stuck working for the devil herself, but Andrea is completely out of place in the fashion world. Her wardrobe consists of baggy sweaters and scruffy ballet flats, but all the other girls at Runway show up to work in stiletto heels and Chanel dresses. Eventually, Andrea's coworker Nigel (Stanley Tucci) takes pity on her and helps her "dress the part" by providing her with designer samples from the magazine's clothing collection...but will a chic new look be enough to help Andrea survive in the evil fashion industry?<br /><br />Overall, I think this movie was a pretty good adaptation of Weisberger's novel. Some things were changed in order to trim down the script and provide additional comic relief, but it wasn't anything major. However, the one major difference between the book and the movie is that Miranda shows signs of compassion and weakness in the film. Granted, they are very BRIEF moments of compassion and weakness, but as a result the character loses some of the viciousness that she possesses in the book. I was also disappointed by the way Andrea's relationship with fashion playboy Christian (Simon Baker) was handled in the film and the way the big Paris confrontation scene between Andrea and Miranda was completely toned down. My guess is that the producers didn't want to use the "F" word in a PG-13 film, but COME ON! Fans of the book were completely robbed of that magical moment.<br /><br />Meryl Streep is by far the best thing about this movie...however, I think she's too good for this film. Nothing else about "The Devil Wears Prada" is a match for Streep's excellent performance. I thought that Anne Hathaway was okay as Andrea, but she kind of annoyed me...of course, Andrea's character is kind of annoying in general, so maybe that's all it is. Still, I was expecting more. (At least the clothes were great, though! WOW! But Andrea gave her Paris clothes to EMILY?! What's up with that?! And Emily gets hit by a CAR?! WHY?! Why did they make such silly changes like that?!)<br /><br />Overall, this movie is worth seeing if you enjoyed Weisberger's book. However, the best thing about the book is the character of Miranda, and I was disappointed that her nastiness was underplayed in the film (through no fault of Streep's...this is just a script issue).</p></body></html>

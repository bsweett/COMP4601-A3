The director of this tale is Mexican director Guillermo del Toro.<br /><br />(2) The film based is on the Dark Horse Comics work Hellboy: Seed of Destruction by Mike Mignola.<br /><br />(3) Released in 2004, it earned $60 million at the U.S. box office, and $100 million worldwide<br /><br />(4) Hellboy comes into existence when Russian mystic Grigori Rasputin along with aid of the Nazi's on the shores of Scotland opens a portal to the otherworld of Ogdru Jahad, evil entities. Rasputin wants to unleash them on the Earth so as to destroy the Earth. At the time of the opening, due to the ensuing confusion and going of of a grenade when the Americans attack the nazi's, Rasputing gets sucked into the otherworld and a little demon baby with horns with one hand of stone and one normal hand happens to zip from the otherworld to the real world. He is raised by  Professor Trevor Bruttenholm who becomes the head of the Bureau of Paranormal Research & Defense.  60 years forward, a grown fish boy only 20 something in demomn years , a fish-like being named Abe Sapien, who has very advanced psychic abilities, and Liz Sherman, a pyrokinetic who has yet to learn to control her pyrotechnic abilities and is implied to have unintentionally injured people when overly emotional team up against the re-emergence of Rasputin, and work to foil him plans of his unfinished task of unleashing the Ogdru Jahad from the other world. Incidentally the Ogdru Jahad can be unleashed only using the Stone hand of Helloboy which acts as the key to the lock.<br /><br />(5) There is a nice ligh moment in the movie featuring a potential love trianlge between John Myers, Liz Sherman and Hellboy. The scenes of Hellboy getting jealous over John trying to hit on Liz provide a nice comic relief.<br /><br />(6) Great Visuals. Outlandish and authentic comic book type production design. Great looking menacing creatures. This is not just a special effects super hero movie, its a superhero movie with large themes, well etched characters that you care for, and an epic comic book drama feel to it.<br /><br />...Guillermo del Toro got it just right. Waiting for Hellboy 2: The golden army.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></body></html>

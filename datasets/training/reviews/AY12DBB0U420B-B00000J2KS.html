<meta name="summary" content="Excellent DVD Adaptation of a Classic Movie."></head><body><p>In the late 60s and early 70s, I was very interested in artsy movies and I'd attend films at several of San Diego's art theaters. Most of the films were foreign. At that time a very-highly-acclaimed film was released to the major theaters and that was Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange" and it was X rated, amazingly  enough. The X rating was for the violence content not what you might be thinking. Well, it was a pretty violent film at the time but would be pretty mild by today's standards. I was really taken back by the film. It was quite unlike anything I'd seen up to that time and I was talking about it for several years thereafter. Well, I recently found a new "A Clockwork Orange" DVD on my favorite bargain rack and I snapped it up in an instant. The film is now just about 40 years old and has held up remarkably well.<br /><br />The basic story in "A Clockwork Orange" had to do with a small group of English hoodlums who got their kicks by savagely beating people up and other assorted violence. It was a random and very impersonal striking out and finally they were caught after the leader caused the death of one of his innocent victims and was sent off to prison for an extended period. While in prison, he became part of an experimental rehabilitation program to attempt to cure those with excessively violent tendencies. He was proclaimed cured and then released back into society. His cure proved to be quite a burden for him. It's an interesting story and can be endlessly argued from a wide variety of viewpoints. It's very well done and the DVD adaptation is excellent. I didn't enjoy it as much in viewing it as I did the first time, but it's a classic movie and is well worth anyone's viewing time, if they can stand the violence.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

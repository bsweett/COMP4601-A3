Some good CGI there, and up to usual standards in the web-slinging and -swinging.<br /><br />What's not: pretty much everythinng else. Dialog like "I like being bad," professional and amorous jealousies that an eight-grader would find puerile, and a positively painful attempt by Mr. Parker to act as the black glop recommends.<br /><br />I like comic book movies, some of them, and I liked the earlier Spiderman movies. I just don't like this.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

Eric Bana stars as mild mannered scientist Bruce Banner who is accidently hit by gamma rays, which triggers his anger, and he turns into  a guargation green skinned monster and superhero known as The Hulk with unstopable powers. I don't care if people didn't like it, this one was made for Marvel comic fans, Spider-Man 1&amp;2 was made for everybody. I'm a Marvel Comic fan. Oscar winner Jennifer Connoly stars as Betty Ross, the only person who knows that the Hulk isn't dangerous. Sam Elliott stars as Betty's dad General &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; Ross, the man who doing anything to stop the innocent beast and Nick Notle as Bruce's insane dad.

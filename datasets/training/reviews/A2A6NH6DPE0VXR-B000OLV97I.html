It skips a lot of character development to put the dragon in the hands of Eragon right in the very beginning of the movie. Heck it even has the dragon grow quickly and goes straight to Eragon training to be a dragon rider pretty quick. It's faithful to the book but with cutting out a lot of talking to mostly just have action. The best thing about the movie is the relationship between Eragon and the dragon. It's well done how they communicate by their minds and is faithful to the book. Jeromy Irons isn't bad either and is prety brave I must say. I mean he had the guts to do another dragon movie after Dungeons and Dragons...lol.<br /><br />  The direction is  kind of sloppy though since everything is just quickly thrown together with no real scenes of wonder. I don't think it's fair that it got bad reviews because everyone compares every fantasy that comes out to Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. Not every fantasy that comes out is gonna be that good. This is still a decent fantasy with nice looking effects and cool villians. But I'd be dishonest if I didn't admit that it was kind of a mess since it's too fast paced with everything thrown together kind of sloppy. The end makes it clear that there could be more but it's kind of cheesey and doesn't even make that much sense. Plus since this one wasn't that well received we might not even get a sequel that continues after the silly ending that shows that things won't remain happlily ever after. This is a bit of a spoiler but if the king had a dragon then why didn't he use it against Eragon and his in the first place ??</p></body></html>

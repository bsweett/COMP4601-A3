<meta name="summary" content="Dense and Intense"></head><body><p>This dense and intense classic is one of the great detective movies.  Sam Spade gets sucked in to a search for the Maltese Falcon.  Along the way he loses a partner, and navigates his way through friends, enemies and numerous double-crosses to solve the case.<br /><br />The movie is tightly packed - 100 minutes filled with what would take modern filmmakers 3 hours.  Pay attention, or you'll be left way behind!  No frills, no unrequired movements, no special effects - just drama.<br /><br />The Maltese Falcon certainly deserves all the acclaim it's received.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Tense & scary"></head><body><p>This is a good modern horror film that acknowledges its roots, but manages to be original enough to warrant merit in its own right. Psycho is the oldest influence, although this only becomes apparent in the latter part of the film. Clearly Halloween and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre have been an influence as well.<br /><br />Two young women go to visit one of their sets of parents at a remote farmhouse. Once night falls all hell breaks loose. There are one or two clues to the big twist that will occur later in the film, but I didn't spot them at the time and it was only after the film finished that I realised what they meant.<br /><br />The director of this film clearly understands how to build tension. I suspect that he has watched all of Hitchcocks finest movies. Given the freedom to use such explicit violence this is the sort of film that Hitchcock might have been making today if he had been born 40 years later. Except of course it would have been better.<br /><br />I watched this for the first time shortly after seeing Wolf Creek for the first time. For me Wolf Creek just gets the nod because its slightly less derivative. Nevertheless Switchblade Romance is well worth seeing, if you're not easily scared and films don't give you nightmares!</p></body></html>

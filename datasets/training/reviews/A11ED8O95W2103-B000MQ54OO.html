<meta name="summary" content="An objective look at a polar-izing movie."></head><body><p>South polar-izing in this case, but it's hard to miss the fact that some people really love this movie and some really...well...don't.<br /><br />I just saw this movie twice over the past three days, and here's my take on it, with the upsides and the downsides.<br /><br />The upsides were:<br /><br />The animation technology!  Some of the animation, especially the backgrounds, was drop dead gorgeous.  I don't even have HD, and I was mesmerized by how beautifully done some parts of this movie were.<br /><br />The misfit becomes a hero.  It hit sort of close to home for my wife and I because we have a special needs child and have often felt like Memphis and Norma Jean.  What went wrong?  We sigh a lot and wonder what will become of him.  I quietly hope he will develop some great talent some day.  We'll see.<br /><br />An environmental message that wasn't too heavy handed.  The humans are not presented as evil, just as being who didn't know what they were doing.  Once they discovered the penguins, they helped them out.  At least this movie didn't stoop to the now very tired "man is bad" cliche message.<br /><br />Interesting symbology.  The "Memphis" character was obviously Elvis, and Norma Jean was Marilyn Monroe?  The two icons of the 1950's give birth to a misfit who revolutionalizes music among a sort of authoritarian theocratic paternal oligarchy.  Is this supposed to be something like what happened when rock 'n roll took America by storm in the late 1950's and early 60's?  The fundamentalists preached against rock 'n roll, and the kids just wanted to have fun.<br /><br />The music itself.  I found it varied and rather enjoyable.  I've never liked that "Somebody to Love" song by Queen, but I genuinely enjoyed the way it was rendered by the penguin choir.<br /><br />Finally, extrapolating on the fact that penguin couples can identify each other out of the masses of penguins because each has a unique call.  This I assume was the inspiration for the idea that penguins mate when they find "their song".<br /><br />Now the downsides:<br /><br />I found the adult penguin characters to be designed in a way that didn't make them particularly endearing to look at.  I thought the penguins in Surf's Up (which anyone who likes this movie should see too; it's brilliant) were designed to look more fun and loveable.  The hint of breasts on the female penguins just made them look sort of weird.<br /><br />One dimensional stereotype characters.  There's the overbearing authoritarian fundamentalists, the holy roller preacher, the "five amigo" wise guys, the skua bird gang, etc.  There just wasn't much depth anywhere in the character department.<br /><br />Very little genuine humor.  A lot of what was supposed to be humor seemed forced, Disney Style.  I was entertained throughout the movie, but I only really laughed two or three times.<br /><br />And, one big helping of subliminal vulgarity.  I read it elsewhere and so out of curiosity I freeze framed through the sequence where Gloria and Happy Feet emerge from their first swim and tumble through the snow, and yes it lookes like they went through the catalogue of sexual positions.  That was crass, but then this movie is rated PG for a reason.  I mean, what parent would think that a fuzzy little cute baby penguin on all the artwork would mean that they should allow their young children see it?  Who would get that idea anyway?<br /><br />So, a solid three stars for a movie that pretends to be for the little ones but richly deserves a PG rating and perhaps PG-13.  Now, my happy keys gotta stop clickin'.  Tippity tippity tap tap click!</p></body></html>

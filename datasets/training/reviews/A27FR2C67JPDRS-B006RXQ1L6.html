<meta name="summary" content="Take a trip to Chicago!!!!!!!"></head><body><p>With the success of "Moulin Rouge", and now "Chicago", the public seems to be hungry for a genre in Hollywood that has been absent for far too long----the movie musical.  In recent years, it seems only animated films with musical numbers such as those from Disney, for example, succeeded.  Now "Chicago", following in the foot steps of "Moulin Rouge" is eager to buck the trend.  Stylish, well acted and well sung, this movie succeeds in all areas.  The choices of Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger, Richard Gere, Queen Latifah and John C. Reilly could not have been better.  The Golden Globes awarded Zellweger and Gere, the actress and actor trophies in comedy/musical and gave the film the nod for best comedy/musical.  It is well deserved.  The story moves along smoothy and the musical numbers melt into the plot perfectly. The choreography is flawless and the actors can actually belt out a tune!!  Hopefully, Hollywood and the public will take notice and make this movie the blockbuster it deserves to be.  This will definitely be a dvd I will add to my collection.  Check it out!!!!! You WILL NOT be disappointed!!!!</p></body></html>

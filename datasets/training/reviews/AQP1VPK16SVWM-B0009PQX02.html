Burned out hostage negotiator Jeff Talley (Bruce Willis) takes a job as the sheriff in a small town to escape the high pressure world of crime enforcement that destroyed his life. What he walks into is exactly what he left behind but on a more personal scale. When a trio of teen thugs stop in his town to eat and are given the finger by a young girl, they find out where she lives and break into her home taking the entire family hostage. Suddenly Talley must deal with the entire situation he walked away from but on a smaller more personal scale. What Talley walks into turns out to much larger than just a hostage situation<br /><br />A fun high octane thriller that captures Willis in top form, the "Hostage" could play like a variation on the "Die Hard" formula (which isn't a surprise given that writer Richardson penned "Die Hard 2").  The direction is sharp and although showy recalls John McTiernan's ("Die Hard", "Predator") best work. Kevin Pollack gives a nice performance as the beleaguered dad and Willis gives a nicely etched low key performance as Talley that does much more than play as a variation on his character from "Die Hard". Although it didn't pick up much of an audience when it was first released, "Hostage" has enough chills and thrills to keep the audience happy.<br /><br /> A very sharp nicely done transfer from Buena Vista, "Hostage" looks particularly good with sharp images, bright colors with a nice golden hue to many of the scenes. There are some minor edge enhancements but, on the whole, "Hostage" looks extremely good here. Both the 2.0 and 5.1<br /><br /> This edition comes with minimal extras but they're nicely done. We get deleted and extended scenes with optional commentary from director Siri. There's also a typical "Behind-the-Scenes" featurette. It's not bad it's just done by the numbers. Some of the comments by the actors are pretty intelligent and articulate but much more could have been done than scenes intercut of talking heads and scenes from the film to illustrate points. WE HAVE SEEN the film. What we need to see is something we haven't before.  This could be done by focusing on real life hostage negotiator or, perhaps, comments from the technical advisors about what they've faced in the real world. Anything that might have occurred in the film that they think might happen in real life.<br /><br /> A fine underrated thriller, "Hostage" was ignored when it was released and that's too bad; Willis gives a nice performance with a touch more humanity than we've seen before and a touch more vulnerability as well. The featurette is largely perfunctory and the commentary, while it has some nice moments, would have benefited from a tag team approach to make it more interesting.</p></body></html>

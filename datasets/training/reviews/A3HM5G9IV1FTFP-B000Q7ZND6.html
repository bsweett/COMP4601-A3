But I was intrigued by the previews, and have enjoyed some other titles of DC Comics' VERTIGO line, so I decided to give this movie a shot.<br /><br />Surprise! I liked it. In fact, it's probably the best supernatural thriller I've seen in a while. (Did anyone else try to sit through "The Order" or "Lost Souls"? Blech!) What I think helped make the film work for me was the dark comedy subtly weaved throughout the film, which kept it from taking itself too seriously. In terms of the special affects and CGI, I thought they worked well; I never felt like they overpowered the film or the actors the way they did in a film like "Van Helsing", so I never felt like I was watching a cartoon instead of a live action film.<br /><br />As for the acting, I think it's time someone took a stand for much-criticized Mr. Reeves. True, he's not a technically superior actor, but he does have a definite charisma, and I think a very good sense of both action and comedy. (I've seen Keanu give good, effective performances in a variety of films, including "Something's Gotta Give", "The Gift", "Parenthood", "Speed", and, of course, the "Matrix" trilogy. So give poor Keanu a break guys! It's not his fault he's so pretty!) Especially when paired with a more cerebral actress like Rachel Weisz, Keanu does just fine.<br /><br />For a popcorn flick, I found this movie to be well-written, well-directed, exciting and fun.

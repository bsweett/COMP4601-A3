This film's popularity made many American producers rich, and they were convinced they had founded the new age of Horror in the United States with this formula.  Since then, Hollywood has made three more attempts at reproducing this early success; first by importing and subtitling Ju-on, then remaking The Grudge and now Dark Water.  Dark water is by far the most boring of these three ghost story failures.<br /><br />Oooh, that's harsh you say?  Let's see, in order for a Horror film to be any good it has to be, at the very least, interesting enough to keep the viewer's attention.  The director seems to hope that heavily filtered, moody cinematography will do that job instead of good old-fashioned storytelling.  With a very slow pace and a forgettable story (which I won't bother with), Dark Water loses the audience quickly.  The "gotcha" moments, when they do arrive, lack that visceral impact which Horror fans live for.  About halfway through I just stopped caring for the characters' fates and wished the ghost would push them all into the river or something so that it would be over.<br /><br />Sadly, the crown jewel of Dark Water is the critically acclaimed actress Jennifer Connelly.  She is largely wasted here, although she does a fair job with the material she's been given to work with.  If you're madly in love with Jennifer, I should inform you now that she is shot though so much atmospheric filterage that her gorgeousness is dulled with a dark greenish cast.  And as for you lustful ones, she isn't revealing much skin in this flick, either.<br /><br /> Please, can this one be the last of this tired Horror subgenre?<br /><br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle</p></body></html>

But even if you hate it, you will appreciate the complexity of the dialogue and outstanding script as well as the razor sharp directing from Mike Nichols. You will probably appreciate the outstanding acting, especially from Natalie Portman. The film is about the complexity of relationships. Relationships and love in all its variations is extremely complex and therefore when folks don't know what they want and don't tell the truth, it is bound to become a big mess and this film shows just how messy it can get. The film shows how self deception leads to deception of others. It shows how every effort to avoid pain in relationships just leads to more vulnerability to pain. It also demonstrates that in general we are much better at talking about sexual intimacy than emotional intimacy. The character of Alice, played by Natalie Portman, was certainly my favorite and I found her to be the least emotionally damaged of all the characters. Her scene with Clive Owen in the strip bar was unforgettable. She is the least calculating and emotionally constricted of the 4 main characters. Jude Law plays Dan, a fellow who doesn't know what he wants and doesn't like what he gets and has an arrogance and distance that he seems to think will protect him from emotional hurt. Because he is so into himself, ensuring that he gets what he wants without much regard to others, he is not a likeable character and in the end I felt no sympathy for him. Julia Roberts plays Anna, a cool character if there ever was one. She is withdrawn and a bit listless. She hides behind her camera and is not enthusiastic about life. Her best scene is the wonderful scene where she meets Dr. Larry in the aquarium and he thinks she is the wild sex hungry uninhibited chick he has communicated with on-line. Here she shows humor and insight, which would have served her well in trying to manage her marriage to Larry. Clive Owen, as Dr. Larry, gets five of the best scenes in the film. The film seemed to translate well from the stage to the screen. Comparisons to "Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe" don't really hold for in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe" alcoholism and years of intimacy and keeping each other's secrets erupts. However in Closer, the anger and aggression comes not from too much intimacy but from too little intimacy, so that only sex and anger penetrate the carefully constructed veneers of three of the 4 main characters. The scene closest in intensity to the Taylor and Burton fight fests in "Who's Afraid" is the scene where Larry and Anna fully confront each other due to Larry's absolute insistence on hearing the worst and saying the worst. Clive Owen's performance is excellent and I empathized with him more than the other characters. Structurally the film seems to be about Anna and Dan with Alice and Larry on the edge, but the performances of Portman and Owen are so strong that the tables are turned and Roberts and Law are given a run for their money in the acting department. The dialogue is fast and sharp, so you may wish to watch it twice, if you can bear to watch human train wrecks.</p></body></html>

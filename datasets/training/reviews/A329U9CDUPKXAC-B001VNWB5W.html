I've never heard of the Watchmen before this movie so I had no idea what it was about. I thought the movie had an interesting story about super heroes being killed off but all the side stories with them covering their origins bored me to tears. That's my biggest problem with the movie. Most of it is boring. It's very long and very boring. I didn't care about any of the characters. They're all depressing. The movie didn't pick up until the last 20min and by then I was already half asleep.<br /><br />Watchmen fans probably enjoyed it more than I did. I'm a huge fan of super hero comic movies. But this one did nothing for me.</p></body></html>

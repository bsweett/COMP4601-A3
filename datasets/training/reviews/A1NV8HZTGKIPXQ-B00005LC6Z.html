<meta name="summary" content="Halloween 2 Is A Decent Film, But Nowhere Near The First"></head><body><p>John Carpenter's chilling 1978 classic "Halloween" was a true benchmark for terror. Anything following it would not stand a chance of being as good. While some 'Halloween' sequels were very good(4 and H20), some were also bad(3 and 6). This follow up to the original is in the 'good' category. The film, however, fails to capture the real terror of the original. It tries very hard. The story continues on the same night as the original. Laurie has been transfered to the Haddonfield hospital. Michael has survived(!)and overhears on a kid's radio that the victims have been taken to the hospital. The kid with the radio is the son of Dick Warlock who played Michael. There, Michael hacks his way thru the staff to get to Laurie. Dr. Loomis is hot on his trail. It is also in this film that we learn the truth behind Laurie and Michael's connection. So, in that regard, this movie is pivotal in the series' history. It is very eerily shot and looks good, but it doesn't hold a candle to the original. It comes close at times. Director Rick Rosenthal definitley went to the ' John Carpenter School ' when he set out to direct this movie. He got the angles and the mood down right. What he didn't get down right was the characters and the emotional pull of the first film. The writers of this film also turned the Laurie Strode character into a nothing role. You rooted for her in the original, but in this one you barely remember she's even in the darn thing!. It was almost as if the Laurie Strode character was an after thought until the final chase and showdown in the climax. Donald Pleasence was great, but Jamie Lee Curtis was given way less to do. She has a much smaller part in this one. Her part kicks in in the last half. This film plays more like a standard "Friday The 13th" slasher film than the bloodless, suspense filled original. It works most of the time. The other characters in the movie don't fare as well as the few in the original. There is no one in the movie, besides Laurie, that you would care about one way or the other if they died or not. Very undeveloped. They are all just typical knife fodder who would of been just as useless in a Jason movie. Dick Warlock, as Michael Myers, is a very good Michael. At least I think so. He has the creep factor and the walk down pat. The mask is a little altered from the original. I have mixed feelings on the mask. Still, it's a fun, entertaining chapter to the series. Don't expect anything close to the original masterpiece. This film, along with the original and H20 make for a teriffic trilogy of films. The others, while some are okay, don't matter as much. Halloween 2 is not great art, but it's a fun horror film. It had a tough job to do to follow the classic original. It tried it's best, and even though it didn't completely succeed, it came okay. I enjoy it and I think any fan would too.</p></body></html>

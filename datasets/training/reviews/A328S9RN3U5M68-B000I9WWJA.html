<meta name="summary" content="A Sleeper - Really...."></head><body><p>Everything about INSIDE MAN makes the viewer want to love this film: Spike Lee as director, a stunning cast, a good musical score that sounds a bit like Bollywood music, a theme that invites social comment.<br /><br />For this viewer the terrific ingredients do not add up to a unique suspense thriller of a film. The story is a variation of hundreds of other films (writer Russell Gewirtz somehow got away with just an outline of a script of holes) and the technique of telling the story - interspersing post incident interviews with the people involved in the caper - makes it thud along.<br /><br />Denzel Washington is his usual fine acting self, playing a cop with his own demons. Chiwetel Ejiofor is solid as his partner. Clive Owen spends the better part of the film behind a mask but continues his reputation for quiet and powerful characterizations as the bank robber. Christopher Plummer is convincing as the back president with secrets to hide, which Jodie Foster as a middle-woman manages to manipulate. Willem Defoe is fine as the cop in charge. They all perform well in roles they could do in their sleep.<br /><br />Clocking in at over two hours the film seems to dawdle over some inconsequential details in an attempt to camouflage the holes in the script. Spike Lee makes it work because of his style. But in the end the story isn't involving enough to hold our attention ('been there, done that') and this viewer, for one, fell asleep during portions when the film slowed for unknown reasons. Love the director and the actors, pass on the film. Grady Harp, August 06</p></body></html>

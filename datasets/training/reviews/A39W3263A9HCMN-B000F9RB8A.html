<meta name="summary" content="HILARIOUS!!!!"></head><body><p>I saw this movie and it was the best foreign movie I've ever seen! It's in Chinese with eng. subbies and It was hilarious!!! It stars Stephen Chow (who was in Shaolin Soccer) and it has a great cast!!!!! It has choppy (but amusing) s/fx, and the humor and action is the TOPS. But Storyline?? I really can't review that cuz I really didn't find it that amusing. But this was a great show.<br /><br />P.S. As cses44 said, Why is it rated R? I don't get that. But overall, It was a great movie.</p></body></html>

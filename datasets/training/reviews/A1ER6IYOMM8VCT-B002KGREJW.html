Excellent cast make this heads and shoulders above most films of this nature. I personally hate beauty contest and pre-pubescent ones are totally sick and should be banned! The little girl's seemingly outrageous performance at the end is priceless and it shows just how brainwashed and delusional these people participating in this garbage are! A bold and important statement in this film! Bravo!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This should be this election year's issue #1"></head><body><p>As presidential primaries are gaining their full speed and candidates are presenting their plan for the new America, they are talking about the issues of today.  Although most would want us to believe that this year's elections are about "the economy, stupid", I believe that this should be defining campaign year and presidential election for the very important issue of our nation which is health care.  As all Michael Moore documentaries, this one attacks the establishement about the widely pushed indoctrination to the masses that universal health care equals socialized medicine for the likes of Eastern Europe (i.e. read socialized medicine).  We see that countries like: France, UK and Canada have prospered by implementing nationalized health care.  Even Cuba takes care of their citizens, while our citizens get complimentary taxi drop off from the hospitals unwilling to treat patients who either do not have insurance, or can no longer afford their deductables.  I only wish this film re-emerges as the presidential elections reach November.  People need to be educated about how our current health system is really working for us as it is setup today.</p></body></html>

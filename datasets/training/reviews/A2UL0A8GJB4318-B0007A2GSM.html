Only about a year after "Finding Nemo" broke banks around the world, the animated wunderkinds unfurl "The Incredibles," another leap in computer animation and another golden example of how moves should tell a story.  Writer and Director Brad Bird finally gets the hit he should have gotten with the classic "The Iron Giant," but "The Incredibles" is not just Bird saying about time, he shows the same care to the story of a family of superheros as he did to the one about the huge metal man.  At one time, superheros were everywhere, saving people using their impressive powers.  But once civil lawsuits are filed at one superhero after another by people claiming they did not want to be saved, the supers go into hiding as normal averages joes.  This eventually grates on one superhero in particular Mr Incredible/AKA Bob Par (Craig T. Nelson) who wants to get back in his tights even with kids (who have their own superpowers) and a super-stretchy wife (Holly Hunter).  He gets himself duped into going to a remote island, not knowing that a new supervillian named Syndrome (Jason Lee) has his sights set on all superheros including the incredible family and their close friend Frozone (Samuel L. Jackson).<br /><br />The story may have a lengthy set-up, but it is worth it because it gets us to know the family, dysfunctions and all.  Writer Bird gets you in the head of this family of heros, making their eventual plight against syndrome all the more compelling, with the necessary detours of humor, with the funniest in the form of the short and out-spoken fashion designer Edna Mode (voiced by Bird).  But when the film does get going, does it ever rev up.  Spectacular explosions and action sequences provide pixar animators with a chane to show off their boundless prowess.  The animation is absolutely breath-taking.  Where "Finding Nemo" used bold and vivid colors to illuminate the sea, here the animators stretch for photo-realism, or as real as you can get with a computer animated cartoon.  But the jungle environment is eye-popping and the robotic death machine that Syndrome unleashes twitches with attitude.  With an eye-popping mix of heart, humor and animation, "The Incrdibles" is one of the best films of the year.</p></body></html>

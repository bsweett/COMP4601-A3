<meta name="summary" content="King Arthur"></head><body><p>Coming off of last year's "Pirates of the Caribbean", Disney's hopes had to be high for Jerry Bruckheimer's supposed factual retelling of the Arthur legend in "King Arthur".  Instead, they get something that is hit and miss, no doubt in part to a studio mandated editing that turned a n R-rated violent and bloody movie into a PG-13 family affair.<p>Arthur (Owen), is presented as Arturius, a commander for the Roman empire.  On the brink of gaining freedom for himself and his knights, he rescues Guenivere (Knightley), turns on Rome, and alighns with the Guenivere's people, the Woads.  Eventually, this turn will lead to him becoming the ruler of all the Britons.<p>This movie is filled with action and fighting, but as I mentioned earlier, it has been toned down and sometimes feels choppy.  Clive Owen does not have enough screen presence or noteriety to carry the role of Arthur.  Kiera Knightley is most likely the only recognizable name in the cast to Americans, and she does not show up until almost halfway through the film.  She also seems to be a little too small to be wielding the swords that she does, especially against some very large men.  I like the idea of Guenivere being a warrior, but perhaps they should have chosen someone that fits the part.<p>Perhaps I nitpick too much, but this movie for the most part did little for me.  That fault does not lie on any one person's head, and perhaps I will have a different opinion when the R-rated version comes out on DVD, probably this fall.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Thrilling, scary, gross, disturbing and unforgettable"></head><body><p>Acting that will blow you away  and characters that disgust you even though you're drawn to liking what little likeable part of them remains.<p>Depraved criminals that are racist, sadistic and keenly  intelligent are somehow very human and compassionate on one hand and  disturbingly evil on the other.<p>This movie is not for those with weak  stomachs.  Although the psychological element of fear is much stronger than  anything you actually see in this film, there are a couple of gory scenes  that will scar your memory forever once you see them... the type of  deliberate, up close &amp; personal cruelty to another human being that  surpasses the desensitizing we've been through by watching other violent  scenes on tv and movies. The isolation of the movie taking place almost  entirely in one room makes even the most tame scenes un-nerving and  uncomfortably intense.<p>Tim Roth's performance is definitely the most  piercing.  Michael Madsen, Harvey Keitel, Chris Penn and the rest of the  ensemble cast are also riveting.<p>You will never listen to the song  &quot;Stuck in the Middle With You&quot; by Stealers Wheel the same way  again.  A song I once really liked still gives me the willies each time I  hear it.</p></body></html>

WOW ...but ok"></head><body><p>Great movie falls shorts of my expectations<br /><br />This was a great movie don't get me wrong but the critics made it to be like the godfather (not many movies are). Never the less Tom Hanks and Paul Newman turn in class A performances but the films best perfomances are made by Jude Law as the Hitman/photographer and by Tyler Hoechlin as Tom Hank's son. The Cinematography was superb, they did a magneficent job recreating depression era Chicago. This is a great movie, even though it is no Godfather it is still a great accomplishment and well worth your viewing</p></body></html>

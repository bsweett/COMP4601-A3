Early on, there is a lot of spillover from the previous film and from "The Matrix". It looks like it will be another boring sequel, but turns out to be okay. I would have given two stars for the far-fetched explosions and probably one star for the incorrect display of fuel cells (they do not become nuclear weapons). The rest is good for factual filler (e.g., how SkyNet develops). Unfortunately, the final sequence leaves no doubt that there will be a Terminator 4.</p></body></html>

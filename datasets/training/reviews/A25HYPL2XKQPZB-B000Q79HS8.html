I read several reviews of this film and they all said the same things, the camera shots and the editing of the action scenes were disjointed and shaky and hard to follow.<br /><br />I believe it was Roger Ebert who said the action scenes were something you just had to wait through to get back to the good part of the movie.  Because most of the movie is great.  Damon is exciting as the mysterious Bourne who outmaneuvers the CIA that is trying to kill him because they believed he killed some of their agents.<br /><br />I enjoyed the spy aspects of this thriller as Bourne tries to find the traitor in the CIA that betrayed him.  But, this film has really few twists and turns and everything turns out to be straight forward.  I don't know how Damon knew who the CIA bad guy was, but he just shows up in his hotel room.  The Russian bad guys seem to be an afterthought, yet the final chase scene is with a Russia hitman.<br /><br />After that chase scene I settled back in to enjoy the rest of the movie, when with a sad shock I realized the movie was probably almost over and I had just witnessed the climax.<br /><br />The biggest dissappointment between the two films is the action scenes.  Bourne Identity thrilled with suspenseful scenes relevant to the plot that stood out because of their lack of computer generated effects.  Bourne 2 action scenes are choppy and disjointed and confusing, and that makes all the difference in the world.</p></body></html>

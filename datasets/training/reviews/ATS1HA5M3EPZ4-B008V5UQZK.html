With it's sweet and enduring lead character, Toula, many people can relate to the pressures of family and their demand for finding someone THEY, not you, find suitable.  Toula works in her families restaurant and as far as they know, she will be for the rest of her life.  They see her as an old maid and that she needs to get married soon or her life will be over.  She describes herself as 'Frumpgirl' and decides to finally do something about it when she is enamored by the handsome John Corbett, a nice (but non-Greek) guy who finds her just as appealing.  She cleans up her hair, gets contacts, looses weight...yada, yada.  When the two start dating later on, the doubt and frustration of knowing how her family will react starts to upset her.  But they move forward, defying her parents rejection and his parents ignorance.  The movie is very funny, very sweet and offers a lot of comfort in showing that many families in America, not just our own, are dealing with these cross culture issues and anti-old country behavior from their offspring.</p></body></html>

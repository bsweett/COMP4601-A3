<meta name="summary" content="Not as echanting as I expected it to be"></head><body><p>After all the rave reviews I expected this movie to be really extraordinary, and I was disappointed. I'm not saying that it's a BAD movie - it isn't - only that it fell short of my expectations. Why? For several reasons. First, the story was intentionally derivative of many other myths and movies.The idea of juxtaposing the ugly reality of Fascist Spain with a fantasy world was somewhat original, but overall the movie had a "been there, seen that" feel to it.  The acting is excellent, but production values verge on cheesy: grainy, dark, day-for-night shots, etc. A lot like the cheap movies Elvira used to host on the midnight movies of long ago.  And the first half of the movie moves VERY slowly. So, while I found "Pan's Labyrinth" interesting, I'd rank it as only slightly above average overall.</p></body></html>

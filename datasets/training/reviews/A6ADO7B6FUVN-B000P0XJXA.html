<meta name="summary" content="An Intense Military Jargoned Kidnapping Drama..."></head><body><p>A woman in a camouflage uniform dashes through a dense forest somewhere in the United States as a camouflaged man is pursuing her.  All of a sudden they are both stopped by a third camouflaged dressed man who asks the man who is pursuing the girl if he wants to quit by handing in his number.  The audience will be slightly bewildered at this set up as the audience is simply tossed into the story.  However, this is the mysterious magic that David Mamet brings to the audience as he depicts an intense military jargoned kidnapping drama.<br /><br />It is revealed for the audience that the third man who asked if the pursuing man in a camouflage uniform wanted to quit is named Scott (Val Kilmer) and he is a special operative for the CIA and United States military.  Scott is known to them as a methodical problem solver who always solves his problems.  This is essential as Scott is being called upon to recover a missing person who appears to have been kidnapped.  The missing person's identity is never fully revealed as they only refer to her as "the girl", but it is obvious that she is an important person as the CIA is willing to recover her at any cost.<br /><br />The Spartan is a journey into a world where decisions are made under gun point and a wrong decision could get one killed.  These decisions have to be made on a rapid succession as each decision has a consequence that will influence all parties involved.  The audience is lead into highly suspenseful cinematic experience through the meticulously written script by Mamet that depicts this intense atmosphere.  The cinematography combined with the careful direction of Mamet boosts the anticipation for what is to come, which enhances the suspense of the cinematic experience.</p></body></html>

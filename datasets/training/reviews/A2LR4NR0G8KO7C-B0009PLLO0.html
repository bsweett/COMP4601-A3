Who is still interested in the longforgotten battles of an ancient Macedonian army nowadays?<br />Colin Farell is horrible in this movie, but I didn't have a clue what Angelina Jolie was doing. Although everybody speaks English in a normal way, she is using a strange kind of<br />accent. Only the fighting scenes do pass the test, but that is the only aspect of the movie that does. Do not go and see this one if you like this genre. You are still better off watching Troy.<br />That one wasn't all that either, but at least that movie's cast isn't so bloody annoying.

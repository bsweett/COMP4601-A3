<meta name="summary" content=""Neither vampire nor lycan, but a hybrid." Blu-ray review!"></head><body><p>The rare sequel that surpasses the original. Selene and hybrid Michael are now hunted after the vampire and werewolf battle that saw the demise of Lucien and Viktor. What Selene does not know, is that she has important information that the last remaining elder, Marcus must get to free his Lycan brother William. What takes place is thrilling hunt that takes us deeper into the vampire and werewolf lore, to it's very origin.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: The best looking of the series. This one jumps out at you and is gorgeous. Demo potential. All special features are ported over. FINAL VERDICT: ABSOLUTELY UPGRADE.</p></body></html>

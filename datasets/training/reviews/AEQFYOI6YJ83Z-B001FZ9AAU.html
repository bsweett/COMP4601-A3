<meta name="summary" content="An ironclad action romp: a superhero film that's actually a good movie"></head><body><p>"Iron Man" is good.  Damn good.  I'm not sure if it's a good adaptation (I've never been much of a comic book guy), though from what I've heard from my comic-reading friends, it is.  But I can tell you this: It is a good movie.  A good movie that just so happens to be based upon a comic book character.<br /><br />Tony Stark is a billionaire playboy.  He's a womanizer and a partier, who has a soft spot for his personal assistant (who, predictably enough, has a soft spot for him in return).  His company (created by his father, co-run by Obediah Stane) provides high-tech weaponry to the Army, and so Stark's best friend is an Army officer in charge of the Special Weapons Division.  Life is good...until, on a promotional trip in Afghanistan, something goes wrong.  Stark's motorcade is ambushed...mortally wounded, Stark is taken captive kept alive through the use of a magnet that is keeping some shrapnel from entering his heart.  The magnet gives him an idea...an idea for a suit...<br /><br />I had my doubts when I heard Robert Downey Jr. was cast in the role.  Don't get me wrong--I am a huge fan of his, and was determined to see the movie.  I was just afraid it wouldn't work--that he would be too far above the material.  Thank God, everyone else involved in making the movie was on the same page (I've heard that Downey apparently had a lot of say in various aspects of the film, and there was a lot of improvised dialogue).  Downey pulls it off marvelously--it's hard to picture anybody else playing the wise-cracking, smart-alleck, yet deeply-troubled Tony Stark.  Jeff Bridges is a villanous wonder; aside from the fact that I was at first convinced he was William Hurt (sorry, Jeff), I was absolutely captivated by his performance.  (And no offense to William Hurt, either, who could have pulled off the role; and will, to an extent, in "The Incredible Hulk.")<br /><br />Terrence Howard and Gwyneth Paltrow round out the primary cast, each bringing three-dimensional life to their roles (and both actors were under-used).  The script is superb; the special-effects aren't anything we haven't seen, but are still top-notch (not ALL movies have to break new ground).  Both the beginning and the end are a bit of a let-down: the movie opens with AC/DC, and I sighed a little on my first viewing, thinking, "Really?  You couldn't have come up with something a little less-cliched?"  Fortunately, thirty seconds later, things picked up.  And the ending...there was a lot of build-up, and the ending just left me feeling disappointed.  Of course, as good as the first two-thirds of the movie is, it's hard to beat that.  And then there's the real ending, after the credits, which proves two things: one, that there will DEFINITELY be a sequel; and two, that Samuel L. Jackson really is in every movie ever made.<br /><br />So go see "Iron Man."  That's the gist of it.  There's definitely an anti-war point being made (from what I've heard, the comics did the same with the Vietnam War, so if anti-war stuff ain't your bag, blame the comic writers, not the filmmakers).  But overall, "Iron Man" is just a good time.  It's a good movie, filled with good special effects and great acting.  And Stan Lee gets to play a pimp.  I mean, really now.  You have to go see it for that, if nothing else.</p></body></html>

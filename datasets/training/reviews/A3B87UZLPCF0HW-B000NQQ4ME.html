<meta name="summary" content="A beautifully stunning film....."></head><body><p>Set during the Mayan Empire's decline, Apocalypto charts the story of Jaguar Paw (wonderfully played by Youngblood) who is torn from his idyllic life and pregnant wife and son. His village is plundered and the survivors are captured by a neighboring warring tribe and taken to the Mayan city. The imagery Gibson created of the Mayan civilization is spectacular. The virtual unknown indigenous South American cast with their daub, garb and piercing are fascinating viewing as are his visual creations of the city and temples. As with Gibson's previous film, The Passion of the Christ, this too is told through another practically dead language: Yucatan Maya dialect. Don't let this put you off though as it doesn't detract from the film and there's not much speaking anyway. Narrowly escaping being sacrificed in a ritual offering Jaguar Paw flees to the forest and with a survivors spirit attempts to return to his family. Hunted by the Mayan warriors, he uses his knowledge of the forest to out wit them and stay alive. The "second half" of the film is fast paced and entertaining action. I don't know how authentic Gibson's barbaric portrayal of the Mayan peoples is but Apocalypto effortlessly transports the viewer into that time and place and the running stream of love, determination and survival that runs through its core makes it a moving film.</p></body></html>

This is Brooks in his prime and that is indeed a wonderful sight to behold.  <p>Dr. Frederick Frankenstein (Gene Wilder) is the grandson of the notorious Victor Frankenstein.  After reviewing his grandfather's work, Frederick tries to recreate the famous reanimation experiment at his ancestral castle.  Frederick succeeds in bringing his own creation to life but as luck would have it, there is a problem with the brain implanted in the monster (Peter Boyle).  Soon, the monster is roaming the countryside and finding itself in one hilarious situation after another until Frederick catches up with him and promptly puts his tap-dancing talents to good use.  <p>&quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; is blessed with top quality comedic performances from start to finish.  Wilder and Boyle are pitch perfect as the doctor and his creation and the supporting cast of Marty Feldman, Madeline Kahn, Terri Garr, Cloris Leachman, and Gene Hackman all shine.  The production design also is top notch as the Frankenstein Castle's interiors and exteriors are faithfully recreated - with the help of some of the original props - in glorious black and white and literally look like holdover sets from Universal's &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1931) and &quot;The Bride of Frankenstein&quot; (1935).  You would never think that source material like Mary Shelley's original work could inspire such a funny film, but leave it to Brooks to prove it could be done.</p></body></html>

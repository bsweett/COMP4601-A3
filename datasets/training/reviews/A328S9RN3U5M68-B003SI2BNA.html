<meta name="summary" content="A Film Noir with Panache"></head><body><p>Walter Salles has proven himself a formidable director with his successes in 'Central Station', Behind the Sun', and The Motorcycle Diaries': he is an artist unafraid to approach unfamiliar terrain in his growth as a director, yet always proving that the most important element in making a good film is to explore the characters more than just the atmosphere.  Those who find faults with DARK WATER seem to be concentrating on critiques of special effects and manufactured terror machines. Where Salles succeeds in this adaptation of the original Japanese film by K?ji Suzuki (novel) and Hideo Nakata (director) is his concentration on developing interesting and strange people, characters with whom we can identify and thus whose encounters with the 'unknown' feel more intensely internal.<br /><br />The story has been related ad infinitum: Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) and her daughter Cecelia (Ariel Gade) move from Manhattan away from her recently estranged husband Kyle (Dougray Scott) to a creaky apartment building on Roosevelt Island to the benefit of real estate agent Mr. Murray (John C. Reilly) and under the suspicious eye of building super Veeck (Pete Postlethwaite).  The building and the constant rain are ominous from the start but soon strange events happen that suggest either mental decline of both Dahlia and Ceci or the presence of ghosts.  The title of the film describes not only the bleak atmospheric element that drives the story but also the netherworld that admixes surrealistic phenomena with psychosis. Characters enter the story naturally and comfortably: Jeff Platzer (Tim Roth) offers his legal defense of Dahlia in a manner that belies his mode of existence; Ceci's Teacher (Camryn Manheim) brings reality testing to the fuzzy world of imaginary friends; Alison Sealy-Smith as a supervisor where Dahlia seeks work is one of Dahlia's few kind encounters.<br /><br />Though the pacing seems slow it does march like the descent of a mind into the unknown and Salles manages that well. The film's cinematography by Affonso Beato maintains the grunge effect that intensifies the terror and Angelo Badalamenti has provided a musical score that bears just the right amount of supportive suspense.  But as with other Salles movies the work is supported by truly fine acting and once again Jennifer Connelly proves she can convey much with very little.  Give this film a chance, without comparisons to other films of the genre, and see what Walter Salles can do with a story. Grady Harp, December 05</p></body></html>

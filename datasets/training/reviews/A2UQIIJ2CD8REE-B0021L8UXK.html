<meta name="summary" content="One Of The Really Great Remakes!"></head><body><p>When seemingly random citizens of an Iowa farming community begin to go violently insane, the local sheriff, his wife, deputy, and a teenage friend attempt to escape the ensuing highly suspicious government quarantine. However, they soon find the disease is as hard to outrun as the soldiers, not to mention the murderous "crazies" that are around every corner.<br /><br />Breck Eisner's 2010 remake of George A. Romero's 1973 cult classic, also entitled "The Crazies", is a great example of how not all remakes are a bad thing. While there still is something I find a bit creepier about the insanity Romero's characters depict, Eisner's more sick-looking, yet generally more dangerous crazies are much more threatening. Granted, they take some edge off the military as the villainous focus in this newer version, but not completely. The "powers that be" are still the most dangerous heavy in the long run, and their presence and threat is constantly felt right up to the end. It's a highly exciting, suspenseful survival/action/horror flick, and for the most part a vast improvement on the original film. Starring Timothy Olyphant, Radha Mitchell, Joe Anderson, and the goddess Danielle Panabaker (I practically worship both her and her sister), "The Crazies" is a fantastic ride that maintains the bleak themes of Romero's original, but with a more engrossing narrative and fantastic visuals. Definitely one to own if you appreciate the genre or themes portrayed.<br /><br />The DVD is loaded with bonus features too. There is a director commentary that is highly informative, though perhaps too focused on the technical stuff (would have liked to hear the "how we did it" on the knife/hand scene though), some behind the scenes featurettes (including one on Romero's legacy of political statement horror, but sadly only using clips from the public domain "Night of the Living Dead"), a still gallery, trailers, and even two motion comics that give the untold infection stories of two crazies from the film. It lacks deleted scenes, but I'll still give a solid "A" for this nicely stocked DVD release of an excellent new entry into the horror-remake subgenre.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Emperor Has No Clothes."></head><body><p>"Michael Clayton" is a lawyer thriller in the vein of John Grisham, which first-time director and screen writer Tony Gilroy has dressed up as a weighty drama. Michael Clayton (George Clooney) has been a "fixer" for prestigious New York law firm for 17 years, content to stay in the shadows and do the dirty work without making partner. Senior partner Arthur Edens (Tom Wilkinson) has been working to defend UNorth, a company that manufactures agricultural chemicals, against a multi-billion dollar class action suit. When Arthur goes off of his medication for bipolar disorder and lands in jail in a guilt-ridden, manic state, Michael is sent to clean things up. Meanwhile, UNorth's senior council Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton) has begun to suspect that Arthur is planning to undermine their case.<br /><br />Tom Wilkinson is a great character actor, and he makes Arthur the only memorable piece of this film. The story is presented in a disjointed fashion that keeps the audience wondering what's going on for an hour. There are a good half hour's worth of inconsequential scenes and lingering, moody camerawork. The film tries to imply that it is character-driven, when in fact it is plot-driven. George Clooney is charismatic, but there is little for the actor to grab hold of in his character. We know next to nothing about Michael. Subplots involving his son and brother are superfluous and superficial. If any of this made "Michael Clayton" a better film, I wouldn't object. But it only makes a pretentious film out of a story that is a straightforward, unabashed popcorn movie at its core.<br /><br />Thumbs down on Tony Gilroy's directorial debut. "Michael Clayton" is a garden-variety thriller with a recycled plot and a good cast. It would be fine as such. Gilroy's attempt to create an illusion of substance by making the film long and confusing is not only transparent, but it put audiences off what might otherwise have been a commercial success. 'Nothing like killing your own screenplay with empty stylistic flourishes. "Michael Clayton" is intermittently entertaining but not as enjoyable as it should be and not for as large an audience as it should have. I'm also a little surprised that Tony Gilroy wrote something so hackneyed, as he did a superb job writing sophisticated thrillers for the Bourne trilogy.<br /><br />The DVD (Warner 2008): Bonus features are 3 additional scenes with optional commentary and an feature commentary. This is a casual but constant commentary by writer/director Tony Gilroy and his brother, editor John Gilroy, who talk about the genesis of the film, getting it made and cast, and provide scene-by-scene comments on the performances, experiences while filming, setting up shots, and more. English subtitles are available for the commentary. Subtitles are available for the film in English, English SDH, French, Spanish. Dubbing available in French, Spanish.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The devil is the plane"></head><body><p>A thriller of a rare intensity. Three lines of crime are connected together by one woman taken hostage by a high class hitman on her plane to Florida. Her father is one stake. She is the second. But most important of all an important person, probably in politics, is menaced with his whole family, if that woman cooperates to save her father's life. The killer will fail, the killing(s) will not happen, no one will get hurt except a couple of crooks, but Wes Craven builds such a suspense that you can hardly believe you are taken along such a demented adventure, that can happen - alas - everyday to nearly everyone.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Universit&eacute; Paris Dauphine, Universit&eacute; Paris I Panth&eacute;on Sorbonne</p></body></html>

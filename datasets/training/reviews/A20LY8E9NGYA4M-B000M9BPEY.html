<meta name="summary" content="TIM BURTON MADE ANOTHER FANTASTIC AND DELIGHTFUL MOVIE"></head><body><p>Tim Burton, one of the finest active directors, returns with another great movie, "Big Fish". The film is narrated in a very interesting way, it is divided in episodes, some of them show the current time, and some of them show the past of the characters. We are witnesses of the fantastic and supernatural adventures that Edward (the main character) lived in his youth.<br /><br />The young Edward, played by the charismatic Ewan McGregor, goes through the funniest situations, he meets a lovable giant, he goes through an enchanted forest, he arrives to a wacky town where everybody threw their shoes to the electric wires, he works in a circus packed with freaks, he meets a poet that has written only three lines in the past 12 years, he goes to the war and he meets the love of his live. And those are only half of his adventures.<br /><br />The cast of "Big Fish" is excellent, it's a combination between veteran actors (Albert Finney, Jessica Lange, Danny De Vito), remarkable actors (Ewan McGregor, Helena Bonham Carter, Steve Buscemi), and young talent (Alison Lohman, Billy Crudup).<br /><br />The technical aspect in "Big Fish" is another highlight of the film, the locations are very colorful, the visual effects aren't as pretentious and overwhelming as in other movies, but they are simple, realistic and effective and get the job done. The makeup and the costumes are also excellent. Finally, the music is outstanding, it combines classic tunes with the original score, written by Danny Elfman.<br /><br />It's a huge mystery why this film was so underrated and ignored by the Academy, it is much better than "Seabiscuit", for example. Anyway, "Big Fish" has it all: fantasy, drama, comedy, adventures, sad moments, tender moments, unforgettable characters, interesting situations, an all-star cast, in few words this is a little gem.<br /><br />The audio and picture in this DVD are crystal clear, and the DVD extras are amusing and informative, there are not too many extras, but there are really good. However, the DVD does include a valuable audio commentary, courtesy of Tim Burton. So if you like fantasy films, this is a very good one, "Big Fish" is a great addition to any DVD collection.</p></body></html>

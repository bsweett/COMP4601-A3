<meta name="summary" content="A glorious film for certain tastes.  Jack Black is great, but there is much more including stretchy pants and toast."></head><body><p>Even if you loved "Napoleon Dynamite" you might not love this movie even though it is by the same director, Jared Hess.  Personally, I found a lot to love in this movie.  The long stretches without much dialogue or narration might bother some, but the bits involving toast are quite wonderful as are the bits with the powered cart.<br /><br />There is no question that this film relies on Jack Black in a way that "Napoleon Dynamite" never relied on Jon Heder.  We get "Jack Black" brand stylings with the way he treats the powered cart as his motorcycle, his singing about Ramses at the party and about his true feelings for Sister Encarnacion.  He is also terrific about the food and around the orphans.  And he pulls off facial expressions like no one else.  Then there are the glorious wrestling scenes that are the whole point and purpose of the film.  The movie doesn't explain the Mexican style of wrestling or the importance of the masks to the wrestlers and the shame of being de-masked in the ring, however, you can learn all that from the web if you don't pick it up while watching the movie.  And you will never think of stretchy pants in the same way ever again.  But enough said, I don't want to take anything away from your enjoyment of this film.<br /><br />Just be warned that quite a number of people have expressed boredom, dislike, and even hatred of this movie.  I am not one of them.  For me, it was a delight from beginning to end, even though it is not the miracle that "Napoleon Dynamite" pulled off.</p></body></html>

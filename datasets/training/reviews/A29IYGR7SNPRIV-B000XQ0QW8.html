So now comes Unbreakable, with a premise that is wonderful. Our culture is bereft of Heroes and we're offered, in the best comic book tradition, a wary, unwilling, unwitting hero. Willis's performance in this film (as it was in The Sixth Sense) is just a splendidly controlled one; and Jackson, as always, is never less than completely watchable. As the ultimate &quot;breakable&quot; man, Jackson is angry, inscrutable, and brilliant.<p>The director has a wonderful feel for children, for their fears and sensitivities; and Spencer Treat Clark turns in a fine performance as Willis's son, as does Robin Wright Penn as his long-suffering wife.<p>Ninety percent of this film is highly compelling. The viewer anxiously, eagerly accompanies Willis along the path to recognition of his &quot;super&quot; powers, at the urging of cartoon connoisseur Jackson. We arrive at a satisfactory climax where our hero's powers get tested. It's a strong, chilling sequence. And then, splat, the whole thing falls to pieces with an entirely unbelievable ending. Sadly, it's all too obvious that the director, M. Night Shyamalan, just couldn't think of a viable resolution for the tale he'd constructed. And that's a pity, because this could have been a great film but ends up as a misfire. None the less, the film is worth seeing for its intriguing and unique premise and for the fine performances of everyone involved.</p></body></html>

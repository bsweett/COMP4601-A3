This one deals with psychology, philosophy, and the seven deadly sins (Gluttony, Greed, Wrath, Lust, Sloth, Pride, and Envy). This one shakes you to the bone (it really works as a top-rate thriller). The acting, the cinematography, the minimal music, and the urban setting are amazing. And you'll be rightfully shocked at what happens in the end. ****1/2 out of *****.</p></body></html>

I happen to be a fan of dark futures in science fiction, either on the printed page or on the big screen.  The fact that ideas and emotions are dangerous to men is nothing new.  The fact that this movie took an almost Buddhism goal, to control feelings, to the point where this future society is out to destroy those who feel emotions is, in itself, fascinating.  The balance between plot and characters, between action and story, is almost perfect.  Christian Bale, Taye Diggs, Emily Watson and even Sean Bean are all great in the parts they were given.  I can't see any other actors doing those characters.  The commentaries, one by the director and one by both the director and the producer, really are interesting.  Beginning film makers would more likely get more out of the commentaries than I did.<br /><br />The idea that by destroying emotions you could better the world is, once again, not new.  In WE the Benefactor's goal, with the help of the Office of Guardians, was to destroy feelings and replace it with Reason (people didn't even have names).  To control emotions with drugs and brainwashing, such as in Brave New World and 1984 with its idea of Hate Crime and Thought Police, is well used in many films and books.  Burning the books, artwork, toys and music comes right out of Fahrenheit 451.  Even in Fahrenheit 451 there is many forms of brainwashing.<br /><br />But this movie is not trying to steal from these sources.  Any more than the reason for writing 1984 was to steal from WE (which is did).  The movie's goal was to tell us how important being HUMAN is.  Some people might say that idea is old yet we still don't seem to understand the need for staying human.  The warning will always need to be there.  And with such a delivery system as this film it can't fail to be passed on to the viewers.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It is as it was"></head><body><p>On America's darkest day, terrorist cells commandeered four commercial airplanes and aimed them at iconic symbols of American Democracy and Capitalism.  Three planes found their targets.  "United 93" is the story of the fourth.<br /><br />The film covers the entire morning of September 11, with the closest thing to a "lead" being FAA Director of Operations Ben Sliney, whose portrays himself on his first day on the job with a remarkable performance for a neophyte actor.  Several other officials and military personal re-create their roles on that faithful day.<br /><br />Selecting a number of people to play themselves was the first step writer/director Peter Greengrass made to present the events in the film as they truly happened.  Greengrass allows the drama to build itself, steering clear of manufactured moments of melodrama many would expect from a movie about a doomed aircraft.<br /><br />The film also refuses to use hindsight in determining which facts to emphasize and has total ambivalence for the cultural impact of some people/events.  No special significance if given to Beamer's "let's roll" direction that became a rallying cry for America and no reference is made to the group being lead by a hulkish homosexual who helped redefine the image of effeminate gays in a pre-Brokeback world.  Even though those have been two important stories to come from Flight 93, nobody on the flight that day knew it...so the film doesn`t revise reality to acknowledge them.<br /><br />The brilliance of a film like this can be understood by comparing it to the film many would have made instead.  A lesser film would have Brad Pitt or Eric Bana playing Mark Bingham and Matt Damon or Tom Cruise playing Todd Beamer.  The action would have slowed for the characters to capture the focus of the audience and build cliched subplots about lifelong struggles to overcome adversity.  Their final rush to glory would have been a moment of catharsis, as they were able to overcome some fault that haunted them for years.<br /><br />Thankfully, "United 93" is not that film.  It is an unflinching, unromanticized account of the events of 9/11.  Free from conspiracy speculation or total disdain for our enemies (they are confused, naive men; not mustache twirling villains), the film offers little or no politics/values.  Michael Moore fans will most likely not enjoy this movie because it doesn't take aim directly at our government and doesn't spend time blaming America and claiming we created a world where 9/11 was inevitable.<br /><br />People will come away with different ideas about how the morning unfolded.  Some will unfairly say the FAA, NORAD and the military were too slow in reacting to the initial hijackings.  But I believe by showing the events in real time, audiences see how fast everything unfolded, giving little chance of preventing the terrorists from carrying out their first three missions.  The only thing standing in the way of the last were the people aboard United 93.  And on the worst day in America's history, one group of normal citizens banded together to show the resolve and bravery that continues to move a grateful nation and will forever earn them the title of "heroes".</p></body></html>

Its inspirational tale has all the trappings of a Hollywood fairy-tale but none of the sappy oversentimentality that often causes unintended nausea in filmgoers.<br /><br />Jim Braddock (Russell Crowe) is a former heavyweight boxer who experiences hard times during the Great Depression.  He finds work as a longshoreman but does not earn enough to keep the electricity on at home.  An opportunity to improve his current situation arrives when Braddock's former manager, Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti), offers him a chance to fight in a heavyweight bout.  If Braddock wins the fight then a title shot against champion Max Baer (Craig Bierko) would be in his future.<br /><br />There is nothing in "Cinderella Man" that you have not seen in similar underdog stories.  What makes this film special is the solid directing and the talented cast.  Howard continuously keeps the story moving at a steady pace while Crowe and Ren&eacute;e Zellweger are excellent as the fallen boxer and his loyal and loving wife.  Special recognition also goes out to Giamatti who is the energetic sparkplug of "Cinderella Man."  He steals practically every scene he is in and shows through his character how important it is for human beings to have compassion for one another.  To sum things up succinctly, "Cinderella Man" is one of those special films that truly inspires while it entertains.</p></body></html>

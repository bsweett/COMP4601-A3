<meta name="summary" content="(3.5 STARS) Nothing New (Actually This Is a Remake) But Entertaining"></head><body><p>Some may say "The Crazies" (remake of a 1973 George A. Romero film) is a zombie film without zombies. The genre's basic rules are there, with slight differences as to the details of the story. If you have seen such films as "28 Days Later..." and its sequel (and of course Romero's masterpieces), you know what is going to happen in this entertaining but routine film from Breck Eisner, director of the 2005 adventure action "Sahara."<br /><br />David Dutten (Timothy Olyphant) is a happily married sheriff of the fictional town of Ogden March, Iowa. After a disturbing incident at the baseball ground that shocks the townspeople, David realizes that something strange and sinister is going on in this sleepy town, slowly turning the residents into "The Crazies."<br /><br />As in his previous film "Sahara," Breck Eisner has created effective set-pieces without relying on graphic violence, even though his techniques employed here are mostly familiar, even clich&eacute;d ones with hackneyed jump scares you have seen countless times elsewhere (like peeping through a keyhole). Characters are rather stock types, but acting from the leads including Timothy Olyphant, Radha Mitchell and Joe Anderson make up for that.<br /><br />"The Crazies" is a good example of successful modern-day remake: slick narrative, bigger budget (though still modest by the standard of Hollywood), and less social commentaries. Nothing new exactly, but still it works.</p></body></html>

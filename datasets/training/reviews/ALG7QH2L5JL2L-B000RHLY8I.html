<meta name="summary" content="Some seriously messed-up people"></head><body><p>Only Nick Cage could pass this off: a guy without a smidgen of conscience that you don't end up loathing, who deals in weapons with the same ease that others go from door to door selling accident insurance for CICA.<br /><br />Why? Because he's good at it, and because there will always be a market for things that'll kill people. Ethics doesn't come into it; at best there's a little squeamishness when he's asked to pull the trigger himself.<br /><br />A product of our times, or the child of a dysfunctional society? I doubt it. People without conscience come in all shapes and sizes. Some end up as serial killers, some as arms dealers, some as business tycoons. Take your pick. It's the variety and range of human expression and human 'nature'.<br /><br />Grounds for despair about the species? Your choice. As for me I think there are enough good people to make continuance worthwhile. But where there is a market for death and brutality, someone will take advantage of it.<br /><br />It's a grim flick, but a good one. It makes you think; leaves you wondering what exactly to become upset about, because there are so many things; from the world at large to this bunch of messed-up people, ranging from Yuri to parents to trophy wife. Or you could get upset about everything, of course, but be warned, because if you're of that inclination, you're going to come out of this movie with a very dark mindset indeed.<br /><br />So, beware.<br /><br />It it worth having been made? You bet.<br /><br />Till Noever, owlglass.com, Author: KEAEN, CONTINUITY SLIP, SELADIENNA</p></body></html>

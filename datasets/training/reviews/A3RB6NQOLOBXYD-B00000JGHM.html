<meta name="summary" content="The Last Great Fillm for Al Pacino and Robert De Niro. Period."></head><body><p>I might of made a bold statement with my title but I fully stand by it and will defends it's position.<br />I have revisited this film multiple times and in different age brackets as well. As I get older though, I can't help but to extol this film more and more. It is not so often that a film can offer a stellar cast, a satisfying plot, powerful acting, realistic character interactions, and excellent cinematography.<br /><br />Michael Mann's Heat which went unnoticed somewhat in 1995 has finally garnered enough attention to warrant an anniversary edition (15th) which will be heading into it's 20th year shortly. (hard to believe) At any rate, this film is proving time and time again why it's receieving the attention it finally deserves.<br /><br />Lt. Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) heads the homocide division of the LAPD and confronts the work of a highly skilled and methodical antagonist, Neil McCauley, (Robert De Niro) after a armored truck heist. Like Neil, Vincent is a master of his craft; dedicated, committed, passionate and just downright professional. It borderlines the point of obsession, or as wife succinctly puts it, "It is the only thing he is committed to doing." The only problem for Vincent is managing this demanding career and at the sametime reconciling the needs of his father/husband role at home. His emotionally disturbed step daughter, Lauren, (Natalie Portman) is quite the handful. Her emotional outbursts and not to mention a half way successful attempt at suicide is troubling indeed. Vincent's 3rd wife, Justine (Diane Venora) painstakingly and miserably fails to have her husband, and previous husband participate in Lauren's life.<br /><br />Neil McCauley (Robert De Niro) is a lone wolf; introverted, organized and very professional. He is a dedicated criminal and trusts his fellow crew members: Chris Shiherlis (Val Kilmer) Nate (Jon Voight) Michael Cherrito (Tom Seizmore) Trejo (Danny Trejo) Waingro (Kevin Gage). During an armored heist, Waingro (a new crew member) is informed by Neil not to kill any of the guards in the truck as this is already established with the other crew members. Unfortunately, Waingro cannot handle the heat (No pun intended) during the operation and intentionally kills one of the guards before leaving the scene. Although the robbery is a success, an unnceccesary dead man is left behind for Vincent to start analyzing and fitting in the pieces of evidence.<br /><br />At a local diner, Neil and the crew know what must be done in terms of punishment for Waingro's misconduct during the heist. During their departure from the diner, Neil attempts to kill Waingro in the parking lot but is abruptly delayed from a local police officer patrolling nearby. As a result, Waingro escapes undetected but not entirely unscathed either. This sets up the 2nd chase between these two men. Waingro is not only a killer on the loose but a rapist too as we see later in the film.<br /><br />The chases between these characters are so well choreographed that the three hour run time seems like a 25 minute sit com episode. Michael Mann is successful at making the characters so real in their world. Moreover, he makes their interactions real and invokes such a genuine sense of familiarity with them. He invites you into their crime life, their family life, and their social life. No character in this film is belittled or made to seem less important when acting side by side with the main characters. Michael Mann treats every character with such equality; and, in effect, their emotional impact is significant and powerfully lasting.<br /><br />For example, Donald Breedan who plays a small role in this film (Dennis Haysbert) is a friend of Neils that just served time and is on parole working as a grill man in a local diner. Although his onscreen time is probably less than five minutes his interactions are so carefully crafted that his subsequent death as Neil's personal driver during a bank heist is quite sad, especially when we see his girlfriend's reaction to his death when shown on the television nightly news. In retrospect, Michael Mann creates realism to his environments. He familiarizes his audience with the characters, the landscape (Streets of LA) and everything in between. Nothing is left unscathed, Michael Mann is professional just like Neil and Vincent are.<br /><br />Some may not agree with me, but I would be more than happy to defend my statement above because I really haven't seen a film with Al Pacino or Robert De Niro that fulfills these aspects. But enlighten me, I am open to hearing differing opionions.</p></body></html>

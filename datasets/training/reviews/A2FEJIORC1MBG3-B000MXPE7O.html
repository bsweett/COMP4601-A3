Matt Damon stars as Edward Wilson, whose career as an agency spook begins with his enlistment into the OSS during WW 2 and continues through that organization's metamorphosis into the CIA.<br /><br />The film opens in 1961, at the time of the Bay of Pigs invasion. When we are first introduced to Wilson, it is quickly established that he is an officious and inscrutable, yet loyally dedicated Company man. As the story begins to jump back and forth in time (a la "Godfather II") we begin to get glimpses of what lies beneath Wilson's seemingly impenetrable veneer.<br /><br />We witness a (relatively) looser and more outgoing Wilson during his college days at Yale in 1939, as he is inducted into the infamous Skull and Bones society. As part of the initiation ritual, he is directed to regale his fellow Bonesmen with the deepest, darkest secret from his past. The club members get more than they bargain for as Wilson relates a harrowing childhood memory of bearing witness to his father's suicide. Moments before taking his own life, his father hands down a credo about "trust", which becomes the key to unlocking Wilson's inner workings for the remainder of the film.<br /><br />Therein lies the problem with "The Good Shepherd". There is an awful lot of internalizing going on (for 2 hours and 47 minutes). De Niro's plus as a director (not surprisingly) is his willingness to give his actors plenty of room to breathe and inhabit their characters. His minus as a director is his willingness to give his actors plenty of room to breathe and inhabit their characters, if you catch my drift. There are some pacing issues with the film. Not that I was expecting car chases and stuff blowing up real good. After all, the reality of espionage does not necessarily lend itself to flash cuts and pop music montage. It's generally a somewhat somber, mundane and unpleasant business.<br /><br />Eric Roth's script has its moments, but gets murky when it comes to the intrigue. It is tough to keep track of who is doing what to whom, and why (and at times, for whose "side"?). Granted, perhaps that is part of the point; torture is torture and murder is murder, no matter how one attempts to rationalize (a point that Steven Spielberg more than sufficiently bludgeoned us over the head with in "Munich") but I GET it,already.<br /><br />Perhaps the most fatal flaw in the film is Matt Damon's unconvincing "aging". There is not much discernable physical transformation between Wilson's collegiate years and middle age. (Maybe some better prosthetic work could have helped?). At any rate, I just wasn't buying it, and found it to be a major distraction. Damon is a fine actor, but I think he may have been slightly miscast here. History buffs may still find the film worth a look.</p></body></html>

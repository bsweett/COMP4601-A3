<meta name="summary" content="Fantasy Book Brought to the Big Screen"></head><body><p>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a fantasy film based on the popular children's novel written by Roald Dahl. This movie stars Johnny Depp in the lead role, joined by a cast that includes some old and new names in Hollywood.<br /><br />What I enjoyed most about this movie was the visual effects. The scene with the squirrels checking the nuts; the scene with the young girl transforming into a blueberry; etc. are creative and fun. In addition to the visuals, there is plenty of music to keep viewers entertained, with a full soundtrack of songs written by Danny Elfman.<br /><br />Depp is great as the eccentric yet friendly Willy Wonka, and he exhibits a certain degree of charm that makes his character intriguing. The kids are also very good, and each one of the five children (the ones who win the right to tour the factory) has his/her own unique personality that is brought to his/her respective roles. The older people in the movie are ok, but not necessarily anything spectacular. Depp and the five children command most of the screen throughout the film, so you don't really notice the older people very much.<br /><br />This film is similar to the plot taken by the novel it is based on, but there are a few changes, like one would expect. One change that I didn't particularly care for was the subplot where Mr. Wonka has flashbacks to his childhood and later tries to patch up his relationship with his dad. I think the film would have been better if this was left out.<br /><br />Most people will think of this as an immature movie, but I liked it more and more as I watched. The fast pace, the cast, the music, and, most importantly, the visual effects make this a movie for everyone to see.</p></body></html>

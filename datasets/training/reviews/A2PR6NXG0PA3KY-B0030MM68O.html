Hard as it is to discount the evidence of your senses when bombarded with skillful and costly cinematography, the 'gritty realism' of this film is totally unrealistic, full-bore Hollywood. Yeah, there may be scenes of mayhem similar to the scenes in the film at times, but not with such convenient regularity, not even in Baghdad in 2004. And there were innumerable other implausible or outright false details; just look at the one-star reviews here and not how many are written by military veterans.<br /><br />So, is "the Hurt Locker" an anti-military film? Hmm. It didn't strike me that way. Is it an anti-war film? Well, it doesn't glorify war, that's obvious, but it doesn't precisely get tough and analytical about the futility of war either. We all know , whether first hand or not, that war is dangerous to living things, soldiers or kids or old ladies at market. The Hurt Locker DOES depict the absolute futility of America's military occupation of Iraq, but that analysis seems almost tangential to the core of the film, which is the portrayal of Sgt. James, the genuine "wild man" who defuses bombs with his bare hands and whose maverick heroism gets several of his comrades gravely wounded, probably unnecessarily. Are we supposed to admire the maverick, or at least to empathize with him? That has to be what the film is asking of us. But the man is an ACTOR, friends! He's good-looking, witty, and he gets soft-hearted about an Iraqi boy with a big smile. The real Sgt James (who wouldn't be allowed such maverick-space in the real army) would not be so appealing. He's a pathological dude, amigos! He's a runaway train you wouldn't want on your tracks. I'm not sure you'd want him coming home to your community, either, even with combat ribbons. The real Sgt Jameses, and there are a few, bring home more trouble than the whole army protected you from. The psych clinics and emergency rooms of America are familiar with Sgt James and his battered wife.<br /><br />Apparently lots of people were impressed with Jeremy Renner's performance as Sgt James. Me, I thought it was shallow. Anthony Mackie, as the second man on the bomb squad, delivered a more convincing characterization. Can a film this bloody and ugly be bland? It was for me. I sat through it without any emotional or intellectual engagement whatsoever.</p></body></html>

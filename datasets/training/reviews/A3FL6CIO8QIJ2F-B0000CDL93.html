"JFK" dramatizes the events that led up to Kennedy's death on that fateful day in Dallas on November 22, 1963 and the subsequent days and months that Americans will never forget. The story is told through the eyes of a former New Orleans district attorney, Jim Garrison, played beautifully by Kevin Costner, and his belief that Lee Harvey Oswald did not murder the President and his opinion that the assassination was the result of a conspiracy by the U.S. government and other individuals.<br /><br /> Oliver Stone directed and co-wrote "JFK" and based his work on two books that dealt with Kennedy's death. The movie went on to become one of the biggest films of the 1990's and was subsequently nominated for an amazing eight Academy Awards, including one for Best Picture, ultimately winning two for Best Editing and Cinematography. The film was also a financial giant grossing over $200,000,000 worldwide.<br /><br /> This excellent two-disc set comes with an impressive array of bonus features including 54 minutes of deleted scenes, audio commentary by Oliver Stone, and a documentary entitled "Beyond JFK: The Question of Conspriracy".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Resident Evil: Extinction"></head><body><p>Since the last "Resident Evil" movie, the zombie-making virus has spread across the entire planet.  The world is a wasteland, but the Umbrella Corporation still exists underground.  Alice (Jovovich) teams up with a group of survivors, led by Claire (Larter), who are heading to Alaska.  Rumor has it that the infection hasn't reached there yet.  Soon, the Umbrella Corporation is targeting Alice and messing up the group's plans.<br /><br />"Resident Evil 3" is better than "2", but not as good as the original.  This time around, things seem more tame, with less blood and gore.  That will upset some die hard fans.  There is plenty of action though.  Milla Jovovich seems to be enjoying herself as alice, and although she has said that this is the last film in the series, the ending opens up infinite possible sequels.  This film is for fans of the series only.</p></body></html>

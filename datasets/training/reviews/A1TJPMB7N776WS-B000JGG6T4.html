<meta name="summary" content="Wounded"></head><body><p>Brooding, Bloody, Beautifully photographed, Tony Scott's "Man on Fire" is probably too stylishly conceived for its own good: too many jump cuts, too many double, triple images on the screen at one time. And yet, "Man on Fire" definitely has visceral punch and emotional impact.<br />In a ferocious and fascinating performance, Denzel Washington (Creasy) plays a wounded, sad, conflicted man with a suspect history who is hired to bodyguard the young daughter (Dakota Fanning) of a wealthy Mexico City couple (Mark Anthony and Radha Mitchell).<br />We have not seen a Denzel quite like this before, even though some of  his "Training Day" stuff remains. This is an older, bloated from liquor Denzel: a man who's external<br />body is a physical manifestation of his battle-torn, wounded psychological make-up.<br />We are in the redemptive powers of Love arena here: there is no mistaking Scott's message. All the snazzy visuals cannot hide the fact that "Man on Fire" is a big muscle bound jock of a movie with a big, bloody, sincere and caring heart deep at its center.</p></body></html>

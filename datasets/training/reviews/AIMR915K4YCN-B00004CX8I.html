He's just gotten himself committed to the nuthouse in order to escape work detail at the prison. McMurphy figures he's hit the jackpot! He believes he's fooled everyone, and will simply coast out his remaining term. Then he meets nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher), the jagged rocks upon which McMurphy's freedom boat will crash. Nurse Ratched is a pompous, manipulative, poker-faced witch. She hides a seething evil behind her blank expression. McMurphy takes her on, thinking he can defeat her with his sarcasm and wit. All he wants is to let the other &quot;nuts&quot; have a little fun in their otherwise dull, suffocatingly controlled lives. He breaks out and takes them all on a fishing trip at sea. He gets the guys to play blackjack, and acts out the play-by-play of an imaginary ballgame when nurse Ratched foils his plans to watch the world series on TV. Finally, McMurphy sneeks booze and babes into the ward. Nurse Ratched is NOT amused! She must show McMurphy who is truly in command. OFOTCN is a tale of institutional terror. Should anyone, regardless of mental state, be treated like children? Should they be controlled / medicated in a way that turns them into vegetables? Can &quot;professionals&quot; be trusted with the care of those they are supposed to help? Or will they just warehouse them, treating them like animals in captivity? What if the doctors or nurses themselves are secretly, silently harmful? This movie explores some of the darkest recesses of humanity, leaving us with lots of questions and a lump in our throat. Ultimately, OFOTCN is about freedom in the face of tyranny. Highest recommendation...</p></body></html>

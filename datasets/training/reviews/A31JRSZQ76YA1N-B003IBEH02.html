<meta name="summary" content="SALMON?  STILL STINKS ON ICE."></head><body><p>DREAMCAST?  Dakota Fanning, Liam Neesen, Vanessa Redgrave, Chalize Theron, Jim Carey ..... or maybe for kink Drew Carey?<br /><br />YOU have the double disk set or are in the mood to get the double disk - DO NOT WATCH "The Making Of" BEFORE YOU'VE SEEN THIS dreadful [what is it???] version?<br /><br />THE PRODUCT really makes one wonder about the talent from DOWN UNDAH .... take away the spfx "expertise" and what is left?  Really very little ...<br /><br />THE MOVIE'S MAIN PROBLEM IS THE DREADFUL MISCASTING???  Rachel W. and Marqui Marquez are far too young and just don't mesh as a valid couple?  RACH - no matter what - stick to comedy - you really are much better in that field.  WHAT were they - Flower Children?  Mark W. was wearing a wigge?  Now that ruined it all for us.  The Daughters - Girls could easily pass for wives ....  kind of a Mormon interpretation.  SUSAN SARANDON's charm is ruined by the "making of" disc - going forward she is the absolutely "bitch on set" ... naaaaasty.  THEN showing us the amateurish "how to get into character or mood" the stars use before each take?  Really - Whatever happened to good old acting?  It's that great line Olivier sprouted at Hoffman during the making of "Marathon Man" ... Hoffman :  "I stayed up all night to get ready for this scene" [something like that] - after Olivier aptly incinerated the diminutive Hoffchild with a glance the following words were uttered by the Immortal : "NEXT TIME - try ACTING dear child, try ACTING" ..... makes sense.<br /><br />Then we have the East Indian [?] boyfriend?  Really? In all white 1970 something rural USA???<br /><br />Stanley's Tushie?  Pillsbury Doeboi gone wong ...... UGH!  AND this deserved an Oscar Nom?  Granted - this is a "Mr. Rogers gone horribly wrong" and interesting that we never quite see what he does to the little tykes... just the rather messy aftermath in his bathtub .....  FAR superior in "Julie and Julia" and "Devil Wears Pravda".<br /><br />ACTUALLY JIM CAREY  or STEVE CARREL would have been more interesting in this role - but it probebly would have killed their flagging little careers totally.<br /><br />Overall - kind of a compantion piece to FRIGHTENERS/HEAVENLY CREATURES.  Jackson's Crew?  Shuddering thought about being on set with that pretentious crowd ... and just where are the ABBOS?  Nary an ABBO in site?  Mr. Jackson  do you discriminate against the locals?  HIS weight loss?  Poor dude looks like a wrinkled deflated blimp .... which is what he probably is???<br /><br />THEN the "Royal Nod" from Stephen S. on set .... Geeze if it wasn't for Verna "Jaws" Fields - and the "other" S.S. he would still be out there directing in sitcom land ........ WHAT IS the Big Deal???<br /><br />SORRY KIDS, all of this crap contributes to the failure of the movie especially the rather milquetoasist lead with that dreadful Catholic School accent ..... another UGH!  Kind of Estelle Winwood if she were still around.<br /><br />WHY is there such a "rave" about the lead?  EXTREMELY mundane ~ nothing unique .... poor child - in for such a disappointment down the line .... and honey - drop the fake accent please or check into RADA if you have the $$$</p></body></html>

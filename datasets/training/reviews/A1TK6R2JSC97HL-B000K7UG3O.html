He doesn't even have to worry about the things that should bother him - like the fact that he lives with his parents.  (In our society, we can "contextualize" mobsters into family men, drug dealers into businessmen and terrorists into freedom fighters, but there's no getting around the fact that you live with your parents.)  Though they love him, Tripp's parent (Terry Bradshaw & Kathy Bates) would like nothing more than to get rid of him, so they hire Paula (Parker) to steal his heart without breaking it and then drag it out of the house.  Paula has her rules, but Tripp proves to be more than an open and shut case of "failure to launch", and soon she finds he's become her case as much as he has become hers.<br /><br />Did you ever watch a movie for the first time and manage to able to guess exactly what a character would say, or what would happen next?  "Failure" has a bunch of moments like that - mostly involving Paula's death-Goth roommate Kit (Zooey Descahnel from "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy") or Tripp's fellow man-child friends, or his father's obsession with nudity, or various acts of cruelty against (or perpetrated by) animals.  "Failure" has many of those moments, yet it's still an endearing comedy.  Never flat-out funny, "Failure" still manages to bring a smile to your face.  It's a movie that should fail - but the cast makes a game go of it, keeping things light enough to get things launched by the story's end.</p></body></html>

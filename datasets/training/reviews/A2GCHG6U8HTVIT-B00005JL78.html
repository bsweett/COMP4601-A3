<meta name="summary" content="There's A Better Movie Lurking In The Story"></head><body><p>I started watching again Minority Report on cable this evening. I've seen it before and have the DVD. My opinion of the movie has gone downhill since seeing it for the first time shortly after it came out on DVD. As a great popcorn flick with pretensions of warnings about power, I suppose it's okay. I've just become very irritated by it because it could have been a first rate film. The whole idea of pre-cogs and pre-crimes is fascinating and scary (thanks to Philip K. Dick), but the execution is just Hollywood. Spielberg's and Cruise's film in my view suffers from three major flaws. The film has an overblown production design. The action sequences are pure Hollywood pandering to the target audience. And Tom Cruise again gives a swaggering, "intense" and essentially meaningless performance. Even with this said, Max von Sydow gives a strong, complex performance and Samantha Morton as the pre-cog Agatha is little short of amazing.<br /><br />There is a first-rate, disturbing and subtle movie lurking within the story, but this version is something of a disappointment.</p></body></html>

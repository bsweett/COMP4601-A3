If you are someone who loves action films you will NOT be disappointed with I, Robot.  Will Smith as the main character is pretty good in the action man "save the world" type roles, and fortunately he continues to impress me here.<br /><br />Some very good special effects further convince me that this is truly a wonderful film.  Wonderful to look at *and* provides a solid storyline.  Just the thought of robots taking over the world only for one robot to be a "bad bot" is a great set-up for an interesting story, and it works.<br /><br />You don't have to worry about having to put up with any kind of robotic talk or whatever, because the story makes sense.  The robots in the film  try to act and talk human-like, which  makes it easier for us, the viewers, to understand what's going on.<br /><br />The storyline mainly focuses on the humans interacting with each other and trying to figure out where the bad robots are located instead of, what I initially feared, a really weird and hard-to-follow sci-fi story that only makes sense to a select few viewers.  That's NOT the case.  ANYONE can get into I, Robot.  Even if you have ZERO interest in robots, you will understand what's happening and won't ever feel confused.  When the humans interact with the robots, it will all make sense.<br /><br />In other words, the storyline in this film is laid out easily and understandably for all the people who normally don't have much interest in robots.  This is a good thing.<br /><br />The only problem I have is that, whenever I hear the name of this movie or see the pictures of the robots, the Alan Parsons Project immediately comes to mind.  Gee, I wonder why that is. :)</p></body></html>

Surrealism is as Spanish as Salvador Dali. Here, there is art, death, and surrealism, set in the war that begat Picasso's Guernica (surrealism, art, and death again).<br /><br />This is a fairy tale of the old kind, the ones that Lang's colored fairy tale books wouldn't tell, at least not in the original form. Everyone has death in them, or murder. "I've gutted pigs before" isn't a threat, so much as a daily fact of life. Even a little girl, all knees and elbows, makes her own choice about who will die, or maybe just a choice about who won't.<br /><br />Behind the horrors of war, though, there's another world. Beings of vast power populate it, and bestow bits of their power where they will. Every action in that world beyond has some special portent. Somehow, though, the menace of that other-world is always something that little Ofelia can manage, even master. The real horrors are out here.<br /><br />It would have been too easy to turn this into a flat out effects-fest. Effects in this movie are good, but subordinate to the story in "Labyrinth of the Faun" (the Spanish title). Instead it's the actors, and especially the actresses behind Ofelia and Mercedes that really carry this movie.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

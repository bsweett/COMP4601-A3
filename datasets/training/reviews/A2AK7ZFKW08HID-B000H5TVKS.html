<meta name="summary" content="Great follow up to the original!"></head><body><p>I like this one more than the original, cause unlike saw where after you watch out the first time it loses its suspense, this one after you watch it, you can watch it again and  again even though you know what's going to happen and it will still make you cringe. The needle pit it the one that really got to me. If you are a fan of horror movies you have to check this one out.</p></body></html>

Joe (Tony Curtis) and Jerry (Jack Lemmon) are two jazz musicians who witness a Valentine's Day massacre.  One of the hoods responsible for this blood bath, "Spats" Colombo (George Raft) knows that the guys witnessed what went on and is out to knock them off before they squeal to the cops.  These two guys need to get out of town--fast.  What better way to do so but to join a travelling band?  There's just one catch.  It's an ALL WOMEN'S jazz band.  Details, details.  And, in the words of one of the characters, "Nobody's perfect."  The two don wigs, girdles, skirts, and heels, and promptly apply for work with Sugar Kane (Marilyn Monroe) and her ensemble.  This is only the beginning of a series of hilarious, outrageous and wildly entertaining events.  What's more, just to make matters more complicated, Joe falls for Sugar and must adopt a second alter ego, apart from his role as her bandmate, and acquires a spot-on Cary Grant accent to go along with that persona.<br /><br />This film is remarkably progressive and timeless.  It's amazing to think that SOME LIKE IT HOT was made in the 1950s.  Marilyn Monroe absolutely sizzles in her role as Sugar Kane and sings one of her most memorable songs, "I Want To Be Loved By You."  She truly is the epitome of sexiness.  Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are hilarious and Joe E. Brown plays a smitten millionaire who promptly falls in love with Lemmon's female alter ego on the spot.  I won't divulge more plot twists, but, I will say that this film puts contemporary screwball comedies to shame.  This is completely incomparable.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Dark Knight Returns"></head><body><p>"He's out there, right now & I've got to go work." - Bruce Wayne gives up some much needed booty lovin' with Vicki Vale to go and take down the Joker, as his alter ego "Batman"<br /><br />Michael Keaton, Jack Nicholson, and Kim Basinger head an all star cast in Tim Burton's dark, gothic, and brooding "Batman".<br /><br />After witnessing the murder of his parents at a young age, Bruce Wayne decides to protect the citizens of Gotham City, striking fear into the hearts & minds of evildoers as Batman, ridding the city streets of Gotham of its crime and protecting the innocent. But, when The Joker, once a hitman turned ass-clown due to a chemical accident, wants to destroy Gotham City by way of a chemical gas known as Smilex (you literally die laughing) & seeking revenge against the mobsters who set him up, its up to Batman to get the last laugh and rid the city of this original insane clown and his posse.<br /><br />After the rise & fall of the 60's T.V. show with a successfull 1966 film released by 20th Century Fox, it seemed Batman would be forever grounded to the pages of his DC Comic (in the 70's if you wanted a Batman T.V. fix it was either watching reruns of the 60's show or tuning in to ABC on Saturday mornings to watch "The Super Friends").<br /><br />In the late 80's with "Warner Bros." owning the publication rights to all DC Comics, the company decided to take a stab at bringing Batman once again to the big screen. But the tone of the comic had changed since the 60's.<br /><br />The Joker went from becoming a dangerous thief to an extermely insane psycho-sociopath killing on a whim & a laugh with goulish devices such as a flower brouch pin filled with corosive acid and his now trademark Smilex gas that can bring a smile to ones face only a coroner could love.<br /><br />Batman also had changed, going from the example setting, lesson teaching hero to the dark, brooding, detective obsessed with keeping evil off the streets of Gotham City & turning into a hero's anti-hero. With Frank Miller's comic mini-series "The Dark Knight Returns" released in 1986, it was only a matter of time before Batman returned to theaters.<br /><br />Die-hard fans were protective of who was to star in the film, however & when, comic actor, Michael Keaton was chosen to star as Batman, fans were pissed, to say the least. Only when the film "Clean & Sober" was released in theaters, 7 and 1/2 mths. before the release of "Batman", did some bat-fans relax. The film starred Keaton as a recovering alcoholic facing his demons in rehab. It was one of Keaton's first dramatic roles, and it worked.<br /><br />Fans gave 2 big thumbs for Jack Nicholson as The Joker, but fans approached cautiously when Tim Burton signed on to direct (his only other credit, at the time, was the comedy "Beetlejuice").<br /><br />The film is great, but, falls just shy of hitting the bullseye.<br /><br />Nicholson steals the show as the over the top Joker, hitting all the right notes of insanity. Keaton is good as Bruce Wayne, but doesn't say too much as Batman. Kim Basinger is hot as Vicki Vale. Screen vets Michael Gough & Pat Hingle are great in their roles Alfred Penneyworth and Commissioner Gorden.<br /><br />The sets are monsterous. "Star Wars" veteran, Billy Dee Williams who plays District Attorney, Harvey Dent in the film has said that the sets for "Batman" are as big, if not a bit bigger, than the sets used for "Empire" and "Jedi". The film, I think, got an Oscar nod for best set design.<br /><br />Danny Elfman gives a memorable score to the film that should have gotten him an Oscar nomination.<br /><br />The DVD itself is a bare bones affair with the film both in the widescreen & full screen versions with 5.1 Dolby Digital and no special features. I hope "Warner" smartens up and releases a Special Edition to this film as well as the other "Bat" installments (well, we could do without "Batman & Robin").<br /><br />Don't hold your breath, though.</p></body></html>

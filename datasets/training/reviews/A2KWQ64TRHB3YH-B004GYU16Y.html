Angelina Jolie, known as Evelyn Salt in the film, is freed from a North Korean prison after being continually tortured in the prison while the North Korean soldiers try unsuccesfully to get her to admit that she is an American spy. When she is released, we are told that she has been working as a top agent for the CIA. We are also told that had a certain man not caused a lot of publicity about her capture, the CIA would not have tried to get her released. She hears this from her CIA boss.<br /><br />Two years later, when she is married to the man who helped get her released, a top Russian agent comes to the CIA claiming that he wants to defect. He reveals that Russians want to kill the Russian president while he is visiting the US and participating in the funeral service for the American Vice President. He says that Salt is the Russian agent assigned to do the murder. Government agents try to arrest her, but she escapes. We begin to see that she has many skills. She tries to locate her husband who does not answer any of her calls. We see a long and exciting chase by government agents after Salt.<br /><br />The film raises the questions: What happened to Salt's husband? Is the defector telling the truth? If yes, how did she become a Russian agent? If not, what is going on? Will the Russian president be shot and, if so, by whom? Why did the defector identify her as the murderer?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant"></head><body><p>From the mind of screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation), Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a stunningly original film that features possibly career best performances from Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet as doomed couple Joel and Clementine.  When Joel learns that Clementine that undergone a proceedure to erase her memories of him, Joel strikes back by undertaking the same treatment.  However, as the proceedure gets underway, Joel realizes that throughout their tumultuous relationship, he has and will always love her, and he fights to save his memories.  As you can tell by the plot synopsis and previous reviews, Eternal Sunshine is not a film for everyone and it's not something that is instantly likeable.  What Eternal Sunshine is however, is a brilliant and original love story for a new age, excellently handled by visionary director Michel Gondry.  The rest of the cast, including Kirsten Dunst, Elijah Wood, Mark Ruffalo, Tom Wilkinson, and David Cross, do great work.  There should be more films like this; Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a surprising emotional tour de force that bombards all your senses at once, and once you take it all in the first time, you'll be longing for another trip.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="All sympathy is fleeting?"></head><body><p>The movie opens with Gerard Butler beaten and tied watching his wife being raped and murdered, and a (thankfully behind closed doors) insinuation that his young daughter has met a similar fate after a home invasion by two thugs.Roll the clock forward to see the broken Butler witness the ADA (Jamie Foxx) cut a deal to virtually free one of the assailants for evidence to bury the other, and explain to the grief stricken Butler, that some justice is better than none.<br />You've seen the trailers, and probably professional reviews, and this looks like a straightforward revenge movie, and it pretty much is, only while trying to be more, and make more social comment, it quickly goes awry.<br />Any sympathy I felt for Butler's character vanished half way through the movie when he begins systematically killing anyone and everyone he can to get back at ADA Foxx, and bring down the flawed legal system. Your initial horror and sympathy begins to wane when you watch him tie up and torture someone to death, the end result making him as psychotic and unbalanced as the men who killed his family. And who knows, maybe that's the message of the movie, that grief and revenge can tip you over the edge? Or is the message that the legal system doesn't work? Whichever it is, it would have been better to channel those ideas into just making a movie, and not being a "clever" director by telling us what's wrong with the World. Most of us already know thanks.<br />At least most of the movie is feasible, even if it's unlikely. 10 years have passed since the trial, time enough for Butler to set his master-plan into action. The situations and schemes are believable, especially when we find out (of course) that Butler was a former CIA/FBI agency whatever, whose specialty was making people dead, even unreachable people.<br />It's a pretty good taut thriller, predictable, but very watchable with some top notch acting all round. Perhaps 3 stars is a little mean, it just could have been better.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Ambiguity and the Real World"></head><body><p>"Munich" is a thoroughly engrossing film.  It is a thoughtful production with great performances by Eric Bana in the lead role as Avner, Geoffrey Rush as his handler, Efraim, and Lynne Cohen as Golda Meir.  Bana's effort alone is worthy of an Oscar.<br /><br />Yet what distinguishes this film from the usual thriller is its ambiguities.  Killing the bad guy is more than just a few gun shots and the matter is solved.  Avner leads a team killers seeking retribution from the brains of the Munich tragedy.  He is determined to fulfil his task but this doesn't stop him from having doubts.  In short, the man has scruples.<br /><br />In the US, many have criticised this ambiguity.  However, rather than seeing it as a weakness, I regard it as part of the film's strength.  All killings must involve doubt.  It is a particularly ruthless person who could behave otherwise.  Steven Spielberg has done the world a service by showing that events are rarely black and white.  Shades of grey are inevitable.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A fascinating and touching film!"></head><body><p>I couldn't imagine sitting through a three-hour film, but Magnolia's fascinating plot and eccentric characters captured me. It is the story of  various people and the errors that have haunted their lives. Tom Cruise  plays a cold-hearted sex guru whose secrets are exposed during an  interview. He is angry with his father (played by Jason Robards) for having  abandoned his family. Julianne Moore plays Robards's trophy wife, a  tormented woman who lives with the guilt of having married him for his  money. The old man's last wish is to find his wayward son and apologize for  his wrongdoing. There are other stories in the film. TV game show host  Jimmy Gator (Phillip Baker Hall) is dying of cancer and wants to reconcile  with his cokehead daughter (Melora Walters). Also, a whiz kid from Gator's  game show (Jeremy Blackman) is tired of his father's high expectations.  There are other stories and other characters, all of which are somehow  connected. This is a rather touching film that should have gotten more  recognition. But why is it titled Magnolia? I still can't figure it out. I  know it's symbolic, but symbolic to what? Anyway, don't let the length of  the film discourage you. Believe me, it's worth it.</p></body></html>

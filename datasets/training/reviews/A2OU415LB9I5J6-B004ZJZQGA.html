<meta name="summary" content="In Bruges"></head><body><p>Nominated for the Best Original Screenplay in 2009, In Bruges deals with a couple of hit men, Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) who are sent to Bruges, Belgium to hide out. While there, they are told to hide out and take in the scenery of the very traditionally gothic village. Ray prefers the big city, while Ken wants to take in the sights. While there, Ray and Ken get their last assignment from their boss Harry Walters (Ralph Fiennes), an assignment neither of them may want to take on.<br /><br />Martin McDonagh won the Oscar in 2004 for Best Live Action Short for Six Shooter. In the short film, a man, Donnelly, visits the hospital where his wife is sick only to find out that she died. During the morning hours he leaves on a train, and sits across from a man with a possible screw loose and his crew. Throughout their conversing they realize that they've all had someone close to them die a the night before, and the man and his crew present Donnelly with a gift that they believe could ease his pain. With In Bruges McDonagh made another bid for an Oscar in the Best Original Screenplay race.<br /><br />In Bruges is a brilliant story. It works on several different levels. On one level you have a man dealing with his past and a terrible thing he's done, something that makes him suicidal and keeps him trying to occupy his mind. On another level it works as something of a buddy comedy for at least the first half of the movie as Ray and Ken differ in their opinions of Bruges and how they should go about their "vacation". And then, on yet another level, Bruges is purgatory, and this is the last judgment of our main characters. At first the movie seems like a travelogue of Bruges, but when you delve deeper into the movie you realize that the scenery and the shots work as symbolism to the last level of the movie. That's one of the great strengths of McDonagh's work, he's a master at telling a story that is entertaining and has deeper meaning as well.<br /><br />The performances in this movie are outstanding. And what else would you expect from Irish and British theater vets Brendan Gleeson and Ralph Fiennes. They're battle over the soul of Colin Farrell's character is equally well written, but performed by these two heavyweights it truly feels like a war between God and Satan for a man's soul as he dwells in purgatory looking for redemption. But while their performances are great, the best performance belongs to Colin Farrell. Behind the tabloids, it's often hard to remember that Farrell is a great actor first and foremost. But here, he shows great emotional range from party boy to mourning the biggest mistake of his life, as purgatory takes through all ranges of his emotion from the best to the worst.<br /><br />I can't honestly find anything wrong with this movie. If you're a big fan of the films across the water that were directed by Matthew Vaughn and Guy Ritchie you may find this boring at times, but at the end of the day this is a great movie. I highly recommend this even to those of you who are fans of the more fast paced in your face action movies. The major thing about this movie to me is that it has depth, as well as action and entertainment.<br /><br />4.5/5</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Loved the action scenes"></head><body><p>A world where women are no longer giving birth. A world in turmoil. A world that will end for mankind in less than 80 years.<br /><br />A lot of war still going on in the world in this movie and it's sad. You'd think at the end of times, man would come together to figure out a cure for what is wrong. Or maybe just not die mad, but peaceful. That part was kinda sad for me. You can just look at most of the people and just see in their faces that the end is near. Why people were even working anymore was a surprise to me.<br /><br />Theo (Clive Owen) unexpectedy gets mixed up in a series of events starting off with a lost love that ends up with him meeting a pregnant girl that he will soon have to get out of the place that he lives to a more peaceful area of the world, and hopefully save mankind.<br /><br />I thought the whole story was pretty well done in the movie. It definitely kept my attention throughout the movie. The pace of the movie seemed very fast once the action starts to pick up.<br /><br />The camera work in the movie was phenomenal. The action scenes were so well choreographed it seemed real. The best part about the movie in my opion was the action scenes. Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n (the director) made every action scene without taking one cut which made it all look so damn real. The last big action scene had to be about 15-20 minutes long with no cuts. I was just in awe with how well it was done.<br /><br />My biggest gripe about the movie was the ending, and it wasnt even that bad, it was just not how I would've ended it. Also some parts of the story seemed to have been thrown in for filler. Other than that though...great movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The romantic movie that wasn't"></head><body><p>"Atonement" appears to be this season's must-see love story. My local art-house theater scheduled an unusual 2-week showing that takes it over Valentine's Day, suggesting that the film's romantic elements make it appropriate for a lover's night out. But for all this positioning and promise, "Atonement" turns out to be a gaily-wrapped Valentine chocolate with a hollow center.<br /><br />The basics of the tale can be gleaned well enough from the trailers. At a sumptuous English estate between the wars, Robbie (James McAvoy), the son of the estate's serving staff, and the owner' beautiful daughter Cecilia (Keira Knightley) are falling in love. They are caught in an indiscretion by C's 13-year old writer sister Briony. A series of unfortunate events unfolds that allows Briony to accuse Robie of heinous crime, and he is carted of to jail, and eventually to war. Later, after Briony has grown up a bit, she tries to undo the damage she has done, hence the film's title.<br /><br />The potential for the story is terrific and the first half of the film has some wonderful moments. Briony is played by three actresses, the most vibrant of whom is the youngest, Saoirse Ronan, who plays Briony at as an emerging woman with all the narrow view, outraged morality and petulant jealousy of childhood. The visuals in this portion of the movie (and throughout as well) are extraordinary. A scene at a fountain, in which Cecilia retrieves a  pottery piece broken by Robie is stunning. And the film's signature scene, in which Robie and Cecilia express their love, ensures that the viewers will never look at a wall of books in quite the same way ever again. But in spite of these moments, the film sputters along on half-power, perhaps assuming that the smoldering emotions between the characters will burst into flame in the viewer's mind. Alas, in spite of the terrific eye-candy provided by Knightly and McAvoy, it does not. Whether due to inept direction or the actors' restricted range, neither lead manages to convey more than one emotion at a time, and that not well. Peripheral actors (notably Patrick Kennedy as the child-loving scoundrel Leon Tallis) managed to convey complete characters, in their few moments of screen, in ways that Knightley and McAvoy cannot. Endless lighting of cigarettes does not an actor make.<br /><br />I found the war sequences particularly puzzling. McAvoy, along with a couple of companions, spend at least a half hour wanding around an enemy-infested French countryside with no more sense of menace than a Sunday stroll in the park. They end up at Dunkirk, where they spend another 15 minutes of film time wandering aimlessly around the tens of thousands of soldiers waiting to be evacuated. This particular shot will impress cinematography fans (it seems to have be one of  those one-shot wonders) but it says very little about Dunkirk (suggesting perhaps that it was just a jolly holiday to be pinned down by Germans with one's back to the sea) and does absolutely nothing to advance the plot. A beached ship in this section of the film serves perhaps as a metaphor for the impotence of the men awaiting rescue, but it serves also to represent the film itself -- gorgeous, fully a-sail, stuck in the mire. As the film returns to 18-year old Briony (played by Romola Garai), it pretty much loses its moorings. Garai spends much time wandering around hospital corridors looking vaguely sad. Gory war wounds replace real emotionality. It's just more screen time that says nothing about the characters or advances the plot.<br /><br />"Atonement" is a baffling disappointment, and ends up being a boring exercise in which actors mime emotional depth by standing about in period costume. It is an example of what happens when filmmakers focus on making pretty images, but forget to tell a story.</p></body></html>

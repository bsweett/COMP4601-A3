In fact, I never even bothered to see it until it came to DVD.<br /><br />And I will happily say that this is a movie worth keeping around, assuming you are one of those people that love a good fluffy adventure every now and then.  I know I do, and the wild special effects and insane plot twists are enough to keep me happy.  Warning or not, it's fun, fairly mindless entertainment that just looks freaking cool.</p></body></html>

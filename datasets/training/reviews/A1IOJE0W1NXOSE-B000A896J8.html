<meta name="summary" content="The Crusades, as fought on the wide screen"></head><body><p>Orlando Bloom plays a blacksmith who has tragically lost his family and then is persuaded to fight in the Crusades by his father, who is played by Liam Neeson.  Unfortunately, after Neeson dies, the quality of the acting goes down throughout the film.  The "holy" war is fought with the usual bloody battle scenes, and the characters neatly divided into good and evil (some on both sides) for which Hollywood is famous.  The film has action, a love interest, fairly accurate history, but unfortunately not much heart.  The leading characters are never engaging enough to cause the viewer to really care about the outcome, and thus the movie becomes lots of sound and fury.  The one point that it does make is that nothing much has changed in 1000 years--Christians and Muslims are still fighting over control of the Holy Land.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Scotland forever!"></head><body><p>"Braveheart" (1995) was the second attempt of Mel Gibson as film Director and a huge box office success. It also won five Oscar awards including Best Director and Best Film.<br /><br />The story is based on Randall Wallace's book of the same title. It follows the life of legendary Scottish hero, William Wallace, from his boyhood till his death.<br />As frequently happens, Hero's life is not easy. His father is murdered by the treacherous King Edward I, the Longshanks, forcing him into exile. Wallace returns to his homeland, as grown up man and married Murron, only to loose her, murdered by the English rulers. This tragic event launches Wallace into a personal revenge that evolves into popular upraising against the foreign rulers.<br />From here on the film takes an epic tone, growing up as Wallace's ascendant grow over the Scotts, leading them from one battle to the next, from one feat to the next to attain their Freedom.<br /><br />Gibson proves his talent as film director and actor.<br />The battles shown on the movie are one of the most realistic and bloodiest ever filmed! Showing the audience what sort of carnage a confrontation on that historical period was.<br />All the cast performs remarkably well, with high points in Mel Gibson's charismatic and convincing Wallace; Catherine McCormack as the unfortunate Murron; a beautiful and expressive Sophie Marceau as Princess Isabelle; Patrick McGoohan as wicked King Edward; Brendan Gleeson as Hamish Campbell (Wallace's side kick)  and many other to long to detail here.<br />John Toll cinematography is full of subtleties and was awarded with one of the Oscar.<br /><br />A great movie for a variety of audiences: history buffs, action movie's fan, romance fans. The only caution is the extreme violence of some scenes for young and/or impressionable spectators.<br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></body></html>

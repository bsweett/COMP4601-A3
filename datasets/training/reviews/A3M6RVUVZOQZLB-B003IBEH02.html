<meta name="summary" content="The way of death...."></head><body><p>I've been waiting for "The Lovely Bones" as an offering on my satellite service. It came last night! I read the beautiful, but very sad book--its basis-- when it was first published. How can a movie depict ethereal, esoteric, other-worldly even adequately? Peter Jackson, director extraordinaire, could do it! He did it!<br /><br />His ethereal success--there is no way to do justice to a review of this movie without spilling spoilers,the biggest being Susie's murder early in the story and by a  neighbor. When the movie first came to theaters, several actors appeared as guests on "The David Letterman Show" to promote the film. Letterman was appalled at the subject matter--the death of a child and could not recommend such a subject. Now that he has his own child, Letterman sees the world through the lens of a father and could not imagine the horror Mark Wahlberg went through as Susie's father. His stunned facial features gave no false impression of this movie!<br /><br />You see, that is the success of Jackson's directorial powers--making viewers feel sick at the loss of life of this sweet little girl (14 and looking forward to her first kiss). The actress is a darling and the audience comes to love her during her sojourn in the afterlife before going forward. Everyone is stuck at the time of Susie's disappearance--father, mother, sister, brother, a boyfriend in the making, grandmother. Even the murderer is stuck in that he lives and relives and relives the murder (much blood was lost, according to the detective on the case).<br /><br />The strange, eerie sequences that show life after death, at least for Susie, will puzzle the viewer. These do not jibe with standard religious motifs. Just go with the flow here. Alice Sebold wrote the novel this way. She is the creator of this world--beautiful, pure, ethereal, but, I found, also vaguely terrifying. My personal taste is that the director keep to the author's world and not create his own. A beloved book made into a film is expected to be faithfully rendered from the word to the screen. Jackson does this. Thank you.<br /><br />This may be a small point from the movie as a whole, but the single most disturbing incident is the destruction of the underground chamber. He took great pains to create a cozy spot, then tore it up, like a spider's nest. Kill the victim, then destroy the nest. Such detail, such effort for one murder. Ah, wow, little girl, what a prize you were. (I'm intending this to sound sick because the man is very disturbed. As the family comes unraveled, so does the neighbor, until he, too, is flicked off the spider web.<br /><br />Knowing in advance that this film is not fast-paced, but rather delivers through characterization, nuances of plot development, and esoteric, ethereal episodes, you will be prepared. This is a film you will love and appreciate for its artistic and faithful details or dislike for its slow and confusing passages.</p></body></html>

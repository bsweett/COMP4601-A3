Memento ends as it begins, and the ending you see, before the credits roll, is chronologically the middle point of the story you watch unfold before you on screen. Confused? Well it is being shown to you in 5-10min. segments, progressing...or digressing I should say, from the end to the beginning. You are completely wrapped up in the life of Leonard Shelby, a man that suffers from short-term memory loss, and lives his life by following the photos and messages he has made for himself.<br /><br />The script is based on a short story by Johnatan Nolan. Christopher Nolan, his brother, wrote the script and directed the film, this being his second feature. It is difficult for me to go on about the plot, because it truly is an experience to walk in there not knowing anything. This was not the case for me. I read a few reviews, many better than the one you are reading now. I knew what to expect about the backwards storytelling, as well as a few key points about the main characters, but nothing that was really crucial. There is really nothing that can prepare you for this film.<br /><br />If you liked movies like Se7en, and Usual Suspects, than I definitely recommend the film. The similarities Memento has to those films are mostly in the overall tone, and that it is without a doubt a part of the Detective/Crime thriller genre. Leonard Shelby (played by Guy Pearce to a "T", he is Leonard Shelby!!), becomes the ultimate hard-boiled detective. He's got drive, that being to find the man that murdered his wife, and he's got his short term memory loss which makes his task go from difficult to near impossible. But, unlike those other films, Memento shocks you at the beginning of every segment, where you are once again left to figure out where you are and whats going on, to the point where you may eventually lose track. By the time you reach the climax ending, you will probably be frustrated having tried so hard to outsmart the film. Memento succeeds on many levels. It is among the greatest noir films ever made. It's got guns, cars, black humor, red herrings, and a femme fatale. It outshines Psycho in engaging the audience on a subliminal basis. Indeed, as a thriller, it ranks with Hitchcock's best. Best of all, it poses a number of profound BIG questions concerning the nature of man, his morality, and the basis for his civilizations and religions in such a subtle way that it almost seems an afterthought. Yes, this movie will really make you think. And it will make you want to talk to others about it. For people who love to see movies with excellent scripts, psychologic effects and complicated plots, this movie shouldn't be missed.</p></body></html>

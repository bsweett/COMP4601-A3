<meta name="summary" content=""It's An Okay Film""></head><body><p>Riddick(Vin Diesel), is a very original character, he's a enigmatic piece of work. He talks trash, he's an anti hero, and a monster that reminds me of the boogie man. This film has no plot or even character developement, there's nothing to this film. It's also very boring, but if you want to see the first installment of "The Chronicles Of Riddick", and if your a Vin Diesel fan, than this is the film for you.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Watch The Original"></head><body><p>I have watched several versions of this story and in my opinion the original version is still the best.<p>This modern version is hyped up with sexy teenagers and definitely more obvious gore....like legs getting severed and bodies hung up like meat. Those aspects were also in the original but your mind was what presented the gore more than actual special effects. <p>The actors are all pretty lame, stupid and witless. But who else would stay around in such a crazy town? The "chainsaw" family are all pretty disgusting, inbred and wicked. The scenery is trashy, dirty and littered with pieces of old dead bodies and rusty cars. Of course it is always dark and rainy, a must for bad horror films!<p>The only thing that makes this film at all interesting is the way that the filmakers present clips at the beginning and end leading one to believe this story might actually have taken place in some small creepy town right in our own backyards. That in itself is enough to creep you out. Don't watch it alone but don't miss the original either.</p></body></html>

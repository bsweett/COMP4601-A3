<meta name="summary" content="Life, death and transcendence"></head><body><p>A tsunami rushes in on an island resort where Marie (C&eacute;cile De France) and Didier (Thierry Neuvic) are staying.  Both survive, but Marie almost drowns and has a near-death experience, with ghostly light and indistinct figures...George Lonergan (Matt Damon), an apparently psychic American in San Francisco, is pushed into giving a reading for Christos (Richard Kind), a business associate of his brother Billy (Jay Mohr); George resents doing it, claiming that his "gift" is really a curse...in London, twin brothers Marcus and Jason (Frankie and George McLaren) struggle to help their drug-addict mother (Lyndsey Marshal) keep it together enough so that they don't get taken away by the social services - but fate has tragedy in store for them.  Three stories, linked by death, gradually coming together, gradually influencing each other.<br /><br />The bulk of HEREAFTER is about coping; George copes with his unwanted abilities, feeling isolated from his brother and even from the attractive and interested young woman (Bryce Dallas Howard) that he meets at a cooking class.  When she thrusts herself on him and pushes him into making dinner at his place with her, she finds out a bit of his guarded past, and the results aren't what either of them desire.  Marie finds both her relationship with Didier and her job as a television journalist faltering, as she decides to write her dream book about a late French politician but can't forget her near-death experiences; and Marcus struggles with loss and even comprehension as a child who feels his life cut in two.  Very gradually, all of them are drawn in similar directions, emotionally and eventually physically.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood's 31st film as director is, like a large percentage of his work, concerned with death.  Strangely enough though this film marks an inversion or reworking of many of his previous concerns, in that death begins the film, is at the very heart of the lives of most of the main characters - and yet, ultimately, is less oppressive and less a tragedy or even endpoint than it is in most of his previous films.  In almost every way, the film starts out in major keys and works its way towards the minor chords, from loudness to quiet, from tragedy to possibility.  It's a film very much imbued with the literary and musical worlds - strands of opera impinge periodically on Eastwood's fine low-key score, and De France's character is a writer and journalist while Damon's is obsessed with Charles Dickens.  Cinematically, it works out as a very un-dramatic drama, and even the coming together of the three plot strands seems inevitable and preordained as a literary device rather than the movie-thriller that the misleading advertising promises.<br /><br />The film is going to irk a lot of people because of its slow pacing, and its refusal to come to anything definite in regards to the questions posed throughout.  And there are going to be people who are serious skeptics and cynics who won't like the hints of the extraordinary throughout the film - which remain, for the most part, just hints.  But this is not a film trying to come up with any answers to life's ultimate questions - Eastwood and screenwriter Peter Morgan aren't interested in such simple pieties, and they are wise enough to know offering such bones for the audience wouldn't let their characters off the hook.  These are people that have to live with the facts of death and what it means to those who survive - even knowing what comes afterward, if anything, wouldn't necessarily make the daily business of getting on with things any better.  And all of them begin to realize this over the course of the film; if there's a definite message here, it's that while the conversation about death and it's meaning is a worthwhile one, it's this business of living and overcoming our dark obsessions with the afterlife that is important, and that makes our lives in the here and now worth anything.<br /><br />HEREAFTER is put together with Eastwood's habitual economy and grace; as has been said many times about his work, it's a film with nearly invisible direction.  This might not always be a compliment, but in this case it very much is; apart from the big CGI tsunami at the beginning and a couple of other important scenes that I don't want to spoil, the camerawork is never ostentatious, never gets in the way of the characters or feelings, which are just about all the film is concerned with.  The focus then is on the actors, and they do not disappoint.  This is the best piece of large-ensemble acting that I've seen in a while and it may be the best cast Clint has ever put together.  Bryce Dallas Howard is extraordinarily charming and winsome in an ultimately unfulfilled role; C&eacute;cile de France is luminous and conveys a careworn look that seems to age her a decade from her first scene to the rest of the film; the British cast members are all terrific and I'd especially like to cite Lyndsey Marshal for a small but powerfully moving portrayal of a woman on the brink.  Matt Damon, though, is working on a level that echoes his director's work, disappearing into his role so completely that he had me completely feeling for him from the beginning.  He is ultimately the engine that drives the resolution of the plot, and yet as a very passive and introverted character it's a challenge to make it believable that he would be able to push himself as he does in the last scenes in the film; somehow Damon conveys that inner power and specialness with an ordinary - deliberately ordinary - exterior in a way that is riveting.  I've rarely seen an "average Joe" who is so compelling.<br /><br />And it's the reality imbued in these special-yet-ordinary characters that makes the last few scenes, aiming for a magic and transcendence that I'm not sure I've ever seen Clint Eastwood attempt - and that few directors in Hollywood today are capable of or interested in attemptin - work.  If you weren't pulled in, put on the edge of your seat by this slow, somber but intense film, you'll probably find the ending stupid.  If like me you really feel like all this contemplation of death, and the futility of really understanding it, has made the small fantasies and artifices in the film fade away and left you with some kind of higher truth - however indistinct, like C&eacute;cile's blurry deathly visions - you may well be enraptured, as I was.<br /><br />It's unfortunate that the trailer for this film seems to promise something like this summer's hit INCEPTION; and given that more people know Matt Damon for the "Bourne" films than anything else, a lot of people will be expecting a thriller, something with sci-fi or fantasy overtones, excitement, effects... They're not going to get it.  If there's a model to compare HEREAFTER to, I'd suggest the last few films from the great Japanese director Akira Kurosawa, who like Clint Eastwood made his name with films dealing in violence and action, but ended his career on a quiet, reflective and humanistic note.  It's a tribute to how great a filmmaker Eastwood has become that he can stand in such company.<br /><br />One of Eastwood's best films, and my favorite film of 2010 so far.</p></body></html>

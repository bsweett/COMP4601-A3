<meta name="summary" content="From Hell"></head><body><p>Johnny Depp comes through again as a detective for the London police. His character is multi-faceted and fascinating. The investigations into the murders of Jack the Ripper, lead us to believe we know the actual murderer for a change. That isn't to say it is clear cut at first, no pun intended, but his following the case gives us an in depth look at police work for the times and conditions in hospitals are very graphic. This is not for young children. This is an adult movie in the respect of the horrible way women are murdered. Although I enjoyed this movie immensely, I personally would not buy it because of the dark and graphic nature of it. It shows us what truly must be Hell. Excellent quality DVD with fair replayability. If you enjoyed this, catch "Sleepy Hollow" and "Time After Time". - C. Luster</p></body></html>

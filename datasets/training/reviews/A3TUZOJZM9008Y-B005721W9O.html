So, I had an opportunity to see one of the original drafts... "Captain Starshine".<p>I was wary when they cast Tim  Allen. I laughed when they cast Sigourney Weaver. I cheered when they cast Alan Rickman. And after the years of waiting for this movie, it was all  worth it. The cast and director brought together a movie with heart, spirit and a lot of laughs. Tony Shaloub and Sam Rockwell nearly steal the show from their better-known co-stars.<p>A great comedy classic. Yes, a Trekkie/Trekker will probably get more out of it. But that is not a pre-requisite to enjoying this film.</p></body></html>

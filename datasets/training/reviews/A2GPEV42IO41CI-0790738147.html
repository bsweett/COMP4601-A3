<meta name="summary" content="Good old-fashioned police story with all-star cast"></head><body><p>"L.A. Confidential" is the story of three Los Angeles police officers who work in a rather corrupt department in 1953.  Bud White (Russell Crowe) has a violent temper and is not above beating up a suspect to get answers.  Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) loves the spotlight; he's the technical consultant for a TV show and takes bribes from a gossip columnist.  Exley (Guy Pearce) is a young, straight-arrow cop who wants to live up to his late father's reputation.  Together, they investigate some murders that may involve a high-priced call-girl (Oscar-winner Kim Basinger).<br /><br />This movie is often described as a "film noir," and that kept me from seeing the movie for a long time.  But I do like the movie a lot; the actors are all wonderful and there are several twists to the story.  It is an ensemble piece; the four stars give exciting, yet understated performances, and James Cromwell, as the police captain, and Danny De Vito, as the tabloid writer, are also outstanding.  This is a trip back to days of "Dragnet," with interesting characters, some violence, and lots of suspense.  Heartily recommended.</p></body></html>

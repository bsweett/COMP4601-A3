<meta name="summary" content="Weak film that is carried by Theron's peformance"></head><body><p>The film follows the life Aileen Wuornos( Charlize Theron), a female prostitute, who in the 1980's and the 1990's, kills 7 different men over the course of months. It also shows a relationship she had at the time with a woman (Christina Ricci) and how the murders tore their relationship apart.<br /><br />Depressing. That is the first word that went into my head after I got up and left the cinema when I went to see this back in 2003. I also felt digust and had a sense of being dirty. In the car, I didn't speak about it to my companion that was feeling the same thing that I was. The film hits the mark dead on with the feelings and the emotions and the acting. When you are done with this movie, you walk out of it feeling "Why did I see that?" because it is one of the darkest stories I have ever seen told on the screen. It makes you feel bad. It just makes your skin crawl over. There is not a single bone in my body that was creeped out by what I had seen in that.<br /><br />Patty Jenkins, for a first time director, introduces nothing new to the film world. She has so-so direction that is highlighted by Theron's amazing transformation into Wuornos. The only way that a person can say they got something out of the film was to look at Theron's performance and say "that is the only good thing, her performance." The reason why the film was critically acclaimed was by her performance, and performance only. The performance was what set the film. You weren't watching the other actors take their turn. You were watching Theron in awe as she displays the sickening life of the murder that she was ask to portray. The writing itself was mediocre and was all over the place, it took Theron's character and developed her the most while leaving other characters with little or no development at all. Like I said, it was a star making vehicle for Charlize Theron like Risky Business was for Tom Cruise or The Hustler was for Paul Newman. The film focuses mostly on Theron and never lets up.<br /><br />Theron's performance was amazing, in a word. She takes the character and develops the mannerisms of the person and the personality also. She makes you hate and feel for her at the same time the development of the character shows towards the end of the film when Aileen looks back in desperation of getting a last glimpse of her lover.<br /><br />Overall, the film make me depressed, but I was in awe of Charlize's performance and was glad that she won the Oscar for it, because before this, she really hadn't impressed me with her other films as they hadn't any challenging roles that she could free herself in as a actress. Decent film, amazing performance.</p></body></html>

But since elegantly civilized entertainments are in short supply these days, I won't be too hard on it. With the magnificent help of cinematographer Dick Pope and production designer Ondrej Nekvasil, Burger crafts a somber, rich and romantic mystery based on Steven Millhauser's short story about Eisenheim, a brilliant magician in 1900 Vienna, who tries to reclaim Sophie, his aristocratic, long-lost love. However, the treacherous Crown Prince Leopold wants Sophie as his consort, and orders the assiduous Chief Inspector Uhl to rid the empire of Eisenheim, by any means possible. What follows is a compelling cat-and-mouse game that touches on the eternal mysteries of existence, and at its best leaves the audience truly breathless with its artful legerdemain. Unfortunately, the story's denouement, while clever, is more prosaic than what Burger led us to expect. But the film's sheer craftsmanship makes it more than worth seeing, particularly since the stars are Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti, two actors who improve any film simply by virtue of appearing in it. Norton, an actor whose eyes reflect unplumbed depths in every role he plays, is the perfect choice for Eisenheim. Giamatti, famous for playing neurotics and boy-men, here plays a character of cool, cerebral intelligence, and does so with commanding presence and voice. Their face-offs are the best part of the movie, and they play them like fencing masters, with elegance and flourish. As Sophie, Jessica Biel is sensuously lovely and dewy-fresh, which is exactly what she needs to be. As Crown Prince Leopold, Rufus Sewell smolders with dark menace, a worthy inheritor of the mantle of the late Oliver Reed. Fans of historical romance and supernatural mystery will find "The Illusionist" a memorable, if not quite unforgettable, example of both genres.</p></body></html>

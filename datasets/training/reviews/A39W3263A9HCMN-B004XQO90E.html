<meta name="summary" content="Better than I expected, but still cheesy and predictable as hell-"></head><body><p>I'll admit I went in to Source Code with zero expectations at all- it didn't look very appealing from the trailer. However, I'll admit I did like a few parts. There are a couple scenes of gorgeously shot, tear-jerkingly beautiful brilliance. That, and the cinematography is worth noting- It is very slick and tone-setting. But the way this movie plays out, it's almost like a parody of the intellectial science fiction thriller.<br /><br />The story has been done before- a computer program where you are allowed to enter someone's body. The Matrix did it, and to a lesser extent but not in the form of a computer program- Being John Malkovich, that movie where a portal was opened in an office building and you could enter John Malkovich's mind for a few minutes. Except here, the program is so that Jake Gyllenhaal can find the bomber of a train.<br /><br />The acting is unbelievably bad. I felt like I was watching a cheaply made TV movie. Gyllenhaal was acted off the screen by that ridiculous hairpiece of his. The plot is so deathly slow, dull, and takes nearly forever to get going, and one of the worst endings EVER absolutely ruins what could have been a good action thriller to begin with. Overall, avoid.<br /><br />OVERALL: 2/10<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Gorgeously shot<br />-Nice special effects<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Pretty much everything else<br />-One of the worst scripts of 2011, almost this year's "Salt"<br />-Boring buildup to a total non-conclusion<br />-Some of the worst acting this side of Community Theatre</p></body></html>

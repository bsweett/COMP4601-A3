Gaspard Ulliel is paticularly good as young Lecter, and all the villians are worthy of being snuffed off; The method of tracking them was dumbed down a little from the book(now that's hard to believe...), but they all provided some nice grisly moments in this often grisly film. The war stuff is actually impressive, esp. the scene within the first 10 or so minutes; There is def. a good look to this movie, esp. some of the forest shots; There is some beautiful photography/scenery surrounding 2 deaths(1 w/a rope, 1 involing a guy who cuts meat and likes to fish...). The director is confident, and although there could have been done on his behalf(like w/Ratner and 'Red Dragon'), we should really be counting our blessings. I thought the cat-and-mouse between Lecter and the Detective in France was well done.  Die-hard horror fans won't get enough horror probably, but there is some; I guess it's just a little tame after 'Hostel'. But you know, I can't wait to watch this again. Everyone is complaining they could have done more with this story; True; But it doesn't make it any less of a movie to me...</p></body></html>

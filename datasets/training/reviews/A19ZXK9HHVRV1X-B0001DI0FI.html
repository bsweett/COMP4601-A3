O'Brian has certainly given writer John Collee and writer/director Peter Weir plenty to work with here, starting with an Ahab-type main character named Jack Aubrey, a British sea captain in 1805 who becomes obsessed with overtaking and attacking a much larger French man-of-war ship that defeated his vessel in battle off the coast of South America.  Aubrey, albeit a man of sensibility and compassion, often endangers the lives of his men in an effort to complete his "mission," even though he is routinely challenged by cooler heads on the ship to acknowledge the fruitlessness of the endeavor and to set sail for home an honorably defeated man.<p>Aubrey is nowhere near as neurotic and delusional as Ahab, and that perhaps is the biggest problem with the film.  Aubrey, for all his bluster, is really not all that interesting a character.  Although we can see where the filmmakers are trying to take us, they never seem able to crack open Aubrey's mind to help us get inside and learn what really makes him tick.  One thing about Ahab is that we always knew why the stakes were so personal for him.  With Aubrey we don't really understand why he is so single-mindedly set on getting his target.  Perhaps the confrontations he has with his crewmen are just a trifle too low-keyed and underplayed to reveal very much about his character.  "Master and Commander" may be a more realistic yarn than "Moby Dick" but, in this case at least, subtlety comes with a hefty price.  An adventure film set on the high seas needs to hit more dramatic high points than "Master and Commander" is eventually able to muster. <p>Having said all that, it seems a bit perverse and paradoxical to now point out that "Master and Commander" also draws its greatest strength from the fact that it doesn't rely on cheap melodramatics to achieve its power.  Thanks to outstanding direction, set design and special effects, we really feel as if we are on one of those early 19th Century sailing vessels, a feeling that is enhanced even more in the battle scenes which are executed with a stunning eye for believability and detail.  And there are many moments of silent intensity particularly between Aubrey and Dr. Stephen Maturin, the ship's surgeon and resident naturalist, obviously modeled on Charles Darwin (though 30 years earlier than Darwin), who can't understand why Aubrey has to go off fighting Bonaparte's forces when all Maturin wants is to be able to go traipsing all over the Galapagos Islands in search of new and fascinating faunal specimens (at least Darwin didn't have to contend with some pesky war when he was off developing his Theory of Evolution).  The subtle interplay between these two characters provides for some of the most gripping moments in the film.  Russell Crowe manages to convey both authority and compassion in his role of Aubrey, and Paul Bettany creates a compelling foil for him in Maturnin.  Aubrey is also up against the superstitious nature of his disgruntled crew who attribute much of their troubled journey to the curse laid upon them by a vindictive god (vide "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner").  The filmmakers also do an effective job exploring the internal decision-making process a person in authority often has to go through in weighing the good of the group against the good of the individual.  The fact that Aubrey isn't a raving lunatic (like Ahab) lessens the drama but heightens the verisimilitude of the piece.<p>"Master and Commander" is a bit of a close call for me, but taken as a whole, its virtues ultimately outweigh its flaws.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Fans of the comic, no need to worry about a disappointment!"></head><body><p>The thing about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0930289234">Watchmen</a> is that it's a book about costumed heroes (the only "superhero" of the lot is Dr. Manhattan) and some may rule it off as "just another comic book." But it should be given some merit for the single fact that Time magazine named it one of the 100 best novels (not graphic or comics, just novels) of all time. Most were worried that such an intense story was unfilmable. A lot of directors and studio execs had tried to bring it to the screen but their efforts fell short before production even began. Then came director Zach Snyder (fresh off just adapting Frank Miller's graphic novel <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LF2WCC">300: The Complete Experience (Blu-ray Book + Digital Copy and BD-Live) [Blu-ray</a>]), and all fell into place. Now, the movie is out and I can't rave enough about it!<br /><br />A quick synopsis of the story, by legendary writer Alan Moore and artist<br />Dave Gibbons, is that, in an alternate 1985 where Richard M. Nixon is<br />still President of the U.S. and when masked heroes have been outlawed,<br />a long-time costumed hero/government agent, Edward Blake, is murdered<br />and another costumed hero/vigilante, Rorschach, suspects that there is<br />a serial killer picking off costumed heroes. Through the overall plot,<br />each main character's backstory is explored (think TV's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0021L8FR6">Lost: The Complete Seasons 1-5 [Blu-ray</a>], which co-creators Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse admit to Watchmen being a major influence) as five major ex-costumed heroes try to bring the killer to justice. The story isn't just full of action, violence, nudity and cussing -- although, it's got that. But it's also about the deep psychology and philosophy rooted in superhero mythology; i.e., separation from one's own humanity and dealing with all the drama and mess that comes with life; living an impotent life when not doing what you feel destined to do; being an uncompromising force in a world that needs compromise; giving in to a lie that you believe will help billions of others; and not facing up to a past of lies that you swore your life by. Each character confronts their own inner demons (most of which made them get into the costumed hero business in the first place), while trying to solve the overall mystery of the killer's motive.<br /><br />I'm a fan of the graphic novel (albeit not one of those diehard fans) and thoroughly enjoyed the film adaptation. I wouldn't compare it to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GZ6QEC">The Dark Knight (+ Digital Copy and BD Live) [Blu-ray</a>] per se because the two movies are different in the sense that "Knight" portrays a character that has many stories to choose from, while "Watchmen" is a compacted story with a beginning and an ending. Whereas Batman is allowed to have a sequel because there are several stories to tell, "Watchmen" has one single story and it's told in all its brilliance. And the movie perfectly captures it all. BTW, just the thought of a sequel to "Watchmen" makes me shudder in disgust.<br /><br />I had heard that some content would be cut from the film, but what was cut was small and didn't make a major difference to the quality of the film. And the ending that Snyder and co. did change made the film better IMHO. One of my favorite aspects ofthe film is that it shows in many ways how screwed up in the head that masked heroes would have to be to do what they do. One of the best scenes is a small scene where Dan/Nite Owl II and Laurie/Silk Spectre II are talking at dinner about an old foe of theirs who dressed up and did crime just so he could be beaten for sexual gratification. When asking what happened to the foe, Dan tells Laurie that he tried it with tough guy Rorschach and the vigilante dropped him down an elevator shaft. After hearing the news, Laurie abrupts in hysterical laughter to which Dan shortly follows suit (in the book, they laugh a lot harder); and I think that the fact that they find it funny proves how twisted they are. A well-played and well-written scene among many.<br /><br />I won't lie that there is extreme violence in the film and it's not for<br />the faint of heart, but the overall story is magnificent, nonetheless.<br />The use of music was brilliant and the fact that Snyder used classic<br />songs (Bob Dylan's "The Times They Are-A Changing," Nat King Cole's<br />"Unforgettable," Simon and Garfunkel's "Sounds of Silence," Leonard<br />Cohen's "Hallelujah," just to name a few) was compellingly appropriate<br />seeing how they accompany a comic adaptation that many consider the<br />classic of all comic stories. Not since the use of Jimi Hendrix's "Hey<br />Joe" in "Forrest Gump" have songs been so perfectly matched to a scene!<br /><br />I commend Snyder and company for their adaptation to a graphic novel that<br />everyone said was unfilmable. I thought the movie was superb! I just<br />can't say enough good things about it. I could go on more about this<br />film but then I'd have to get into talking about specific scenes that<br />might spoil the movie and its plot, so I'll digress. If you're a fan of<br />ANY superhero/costumed hero comic book movie or comic books in general,<br />just see the movie. Of course, it's always better to read the book. And<br />most diehard fans are going to notice the differences but I know that<br />what works in a book (as well as its length) might not always work in a<br />movie. If Snyder didn't put enough in, people would complain about<br />that. But if he puts too much in, people (critics) complain about that.<br />I thought he put in the perfect amount, which was nearly everything.<br />This will definitely be one of the best, most epic comic book movies<br />ever ... if not the greatest. See. This. Movie!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Oh, what has happened to a once great cinematic icon?!?!?!"></head><body><p>I was a tender lad of 8 when I saw the original "Alien" at the theater (it was the first R-rated film I was ever allowed to see). What I saw affected me (in terms of movie-going experiences) for the rest of my life. Science fiction was being treated as an "adult" genre instead of the light-hearted fanatasy treatment geared toward kids and teens that it's usually given (no offense, Lucas. I loved the Star Wars films).<br /><br />Instead of bright colors, flashy laser guns and lovable robots, we were given a stark vision of a functional, dirty, backstabbing and morally bankrupt future; and what's worse, there is a creature out there that is darker than any nightmare you could ever envision. This creature was a cold, cunning, ruthless killer without conscience or remorse. It forever changed the way we viewed science fiction (many films have tried to copy it, but NONE have ever even come close).<br /><br />Seven years later, James Cameron came along and created the PERFECT sequel with "Aliens". "Aliens" was more of a sci-fi/action film rather that a sci-fi/horror film like "Alien", but Cameron still held the alien mythology in high regards and integrated it into his story.<br /><br />The original "Predator" was more of an action vehicle for the then red-hot "Ah-nold" Schwarzennegger. The film was pretty good and had some very cool scenes, but not nearly as good as the first 2 "Alien" films. "Predator 2" was OK, but really fell short of the potential that this franchise could have had.<br /><br />"Alien 3" and "Alien Ressurection" were two progressively worse films in the series that pretty much ruined the whole franchise for me. Things couldn't get any worse after "Ressurection".<br /><br />WRONG!<br /><br />2004 brought us "Aliens vs. Predator" which I thought was just a slight step above "Ressurection". It was sort of enjoyable, but it added very little to the Alien mythology.<br /><br />Well, "Requiem" brings absolutely NOTHING to the Alien or Predator franchises at all. These two iconic screen creatures have been reduced to nothing more than "slasher" villains like Jason, Michael Meyers, or Freddy.<br /><br />How sad.<br /><br />The plot of this film is mindless and pointless. The creatures are no longer scary and have been reduced to "tools" used to get a box-office draw (and even THAT didn't save this movie - it was a financial bomb).<br /><br />Thank God I only rented this.<br /><br />I think I'll pop in the original "Alien" and "Predator" in the DVD player and remember what it was like when movies were fresh, original, scary, exciting, and fun.<br /><br />Hollywood.....you suck.</p></body></html>

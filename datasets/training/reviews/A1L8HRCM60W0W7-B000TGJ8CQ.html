<meta name="summary" content="SCI-FI THROWAWAY CANDY TOO LUDICROUS FOR ITS OWN PANTS, BUT A FROLIC NONETHELESS"></head><body><p>This is your Swiss-cheese thriller for the summer of 2007. You know, with so many holes that they're almost par for the course, but the overall experience is one of momentary delight anyway. You savor it, then you go on your merry way. Suspend disbelief for best results.<br /><br />The whole crux of the movie is the FBI's frenetic hunt for a bunch of handsome European miscreants (sporting a bouquet of dialects) who're about to detonate a nuclear warhead in or around LA. The reason? Not sure. Perhaps to make a big bada boom. Perhaps to look real scary. We will never know, nor, I suspect, would the FBI team from the film. But that's not to stop them from acting all pensive and thriller-like. It showers much of the spotlight on light humor involving the protagonist and his love interest instead. He's a magician with a special skill that you should find out for yourself, and she's, well, magical. Some liberal scatter-shot editing follows, but it's a fun ride. The visuals of the Grand Canyon (that's what they were I presume?) are breathtaking. The ending credits roll does justice to the theme, and may get a final round of laughter.<br /><br />There is no way this film merits a serious review, but I will take the time to report one serious gripe: the hairstyles! Tom Hanks may have done an enormous disfavor to the cinematic community by sporting his little rumpled tuft in Da Vinci Code, which seems to have taken off -- Jim Carrie in 23, and now Nicholas Cage here. Time for some scissors, Hollywood! As for Julianne Moore, she's an actress in such fine form that although she's evidently in the middle of something goofy she brings to it the kind of pizazz one would expect from an actual blockbuster.<br /><br />Don't confuse the film with Michael Crichton's novel of the same name, be prepared for a pastime flick at the intellectual caliber of National Treasure, get your Coke and choco-chip icecream, and buckle up to enjoy a basically senseless ride.</p></body></html>

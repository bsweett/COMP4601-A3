Harrison Ford makes a triumphant return to his defining role as the fedora wearing, whip wielding adventurer; who is coerced by a young greaser named Mutt (Shia LaBeouf) into taking a trip to Peru to rescue his mother (Raiders of the Lost Ark love interest Karen Allen) and friend (John Hurt) who knows the secrets of the fabled Crystal Skull.  With a team of Soviets (led by Cate Blanchett) hot on his tail as well, the aging Indy certainly has his hands full.  The biggest flaw of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is that it is ever so predictable.  Any of the big twists, revelations, or surprises you will see coming a mile away; and the biggest plot element of all is so weakly inserted here that you'll wonder just what it's doing in an Indiana Jones movie.  Still though, there's just something about the film that still makes it worth seeing regardless, with spectacular stunt work and action sequences, and the fact that Ford still stands tall as one of the best screen heroes in all of cinema history.  All in all, despite its many flaws, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is an enjoyable romp that many will no doubt be split on, but in the end, seeing Indy back in action is reason enough to celebrate.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Burton's Take on the Legend: Visually Stunning, Action Packed, and Funny"></head><body><p>"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" is one of my favorite short stories of all-time.  There is something about this American folk tale that captivates my mind and imagination.  I can remember watching the Disney animated version of the tale as a kid around Halloween time.  It was pure magic.  And later, while studying English literature in college, I returned to the stories of Washington Irving with an "adult" and critical eye.  Yet, despite the deadlines of college and the sheer mass of reading to accomplish, I always took special time out to enjoy Irving's work.  It can make you a kid again.<br /><br />SLEEPY HOLLOW delivered on all of my high expectations for the film.  While I am normally upset by films that depart from the stories they purport to represent, Burton has managed to capture the feel and appeal of the legend, while at the same time churning out an entertaining Hollywood picture.  In my opinion, almost no one does this better than Tim Burton and he deserves much credit for it.  Of course, true fans of the legend will be disappointed by Burton's take, but I think that once viewers have allowed themselves to live in Burton's world for a while (and not Irving's), SLEEPY HOLLOW can be a great deal of fun.<br /><br />SLEEPY HOLLOW is, from a visual perspective, absolutely stunning.  Burton transports us to early-American New England, complete with haunted mysts and plenty of gore.  The action sequences with the Headless Horseman are marvelous and rank among some of the finest action sequences I've seen lately.  Another thing that SLEEPY HOLLOW nails is its comedic sensibility.  Burton's films are usually quite good at maintaining a level of "fun" throughout their length and this picture is no exception.  There is plenty of comedy to lighten the mood of the picture and allow it to take itself less seriously.<br /><br />Overall, SLEEPY HOLLOW is just a great horror/macabre picture, the kind that only Burton is capable of pulling off.  So if you find a deal, buy this picture, make yourself a bowl of popcorn, and just let yourself go.</p></body></html>

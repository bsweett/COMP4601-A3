Both play shady type people who are tarnished by the rough environment they grew up in...on the wrong side of the tracks in Boston.  I found myself feeling very sorry for the characters and the deep holes they are digging for themselves in their lives.  The films underlying message, I think, is that no human life is unimportant, no matter how messed up that life happens to be.  Another message, sometimes things go terribly wrong and there is little anyone can do to change what fate has in store.  A scary movie, but well dome by Clint Eastwood!!!</p></body></html>

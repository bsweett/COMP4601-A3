I like explosions and robot fights just as much as the next guy.  Throwing in Megan Fox certainly helps to keep my interest.  The problem is that the movie is all eye candy.  It was okay to sit through once to see the great visuals, but there is not meat to the story.  Everything was a set up to get to the next battle, the next explosion.  I enjoyed some of the new robots, but the two ghetto bots grew increasing (jar jar binks) annoying as the movie went on.  My son loved the movie, and I am sure most other 10 year old boys will too.  As for adults, I think you can skip this one.</p></body></html>

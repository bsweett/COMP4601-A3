Amsterdam returns to his neighborhood, the Five Points, in the year 1863 during the peak of the Civil War when masses from Europe are immigrating into the US.  Amsterdam is seeking revenge on the killer of his father, William &quot;The Butcher&quot; Cutting, however, he is approaching cautiously.  Despite Amsterdam's lack of interest in political issues, he is drawn into them anyway through his fathers murderer who is highly engaged in such issues.  Gangs of New York offers a brilliant cinematic experience through the supreme mise-en-scene, the exceptional cast who performs very well together, and the complex story telling that will engage the mind.</p></body></html>

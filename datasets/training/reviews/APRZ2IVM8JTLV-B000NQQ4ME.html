Score by<br />James Horner.<br /><br />  A ho hum film about life in the Mayan empire before Christian<br />civilzation put an end to barbarism and human sacrifice. Numbingly<br />violent and gory with a final half stolen from THE NAKED PREY, this<br />Gibson film is done in by its own blood soaked excess which constantly<br />removes and dulls the viewer to what is a nothing special story in any<br />case. J. Lee Thompson's film KINGS OF THE SUN is a far superior take on<br />the same material in every way.<br /><br />  Hardly a bad film and not more violent from anything from the<br />SAW films to DONNIE BRASCO, anti-Christian bigots set to hate this film<br />because of Gibson being a Catholic take note that you are plunging into<br />an intellectual cul de sac. This is a modern film in nearly every<br />respect---which is to say it is for you.</p></body></html>

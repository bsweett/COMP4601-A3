I wasn't even particularly a fan.  I must admit that I enjoyed this film, though.  The most impressive factor to me (as a recording engineer and producer) was Joaquin Phoenix's ability to emulate the vocal characteristics of Johnny Cash.  He came just about as close as an actor could be expected to come.  Reese Witherspoon also does a very respectable job of carrying a tune in this movie.<br /><br />The life being chronicled in this movie is certainly an interesting one, yet it is certainly not a story we haven't seen before.  It bears countless similarities to other "rock star" movies we've all seen in the past.  They come from humble beginnings, take a chance and make it big, crumble under the pressure of the fame, turn to drugs and become dependant - and eventually get cleaned up by the few people who give a damn.  Sometimes this kind of story doesn't have a happy ending.  Luckliy for Johnny Cash and all of his fans, this one did.<br /><br />The movie is engaging.  Phoenix and Witherspoon are wonderful together.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Indelible Tale of Revenge and Deceit"></head><body><p>This film is inevitably going to gain a word-of-mouth cult following.  My interest in this film was piqued when "Entertainment Weekly" listed it as one of the year's ten best DVDs.  They were not wrong.  It would be a disservice for me to say too much about this intricate tale of a man mysteriously imprisoned for 15 years who upon release is torn between vengeance and curiousity about the identity and reason for his captivity.  The best I can offer about this Korean import is that it can honestly compared to such latter day classics such as "Chinatown", "The Usual Suspects", "L.A. Confidential", and "Memento".</p></body></html>

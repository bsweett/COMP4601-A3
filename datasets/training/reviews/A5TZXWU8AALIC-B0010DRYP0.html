<meta name="summary" content="One of the Great Mob Films of All Time"></head><body><p>Finally! I've never bought GOODFELLAS on DVD because a film this great deserved far more than just throwing the film on a disc to get it out there. I'm thrilled to see it on a 2-disc set.<br /><br /> The three great Mafia movies are THE GODFATHER, GODFATHER II and GOODFELLAS. They make up a trilogy that covers the mob from its beginnings in America up to the 1980's when, fulfilling Vito Corleone's prophecy, &quot;this drug business will be the end of us.&quot;<br /><br /> Are there other good Mafia movies? Sure.<br /><br /> But these three are firing on every single piston.<br /><br /> Pure classics.</p></body></html>

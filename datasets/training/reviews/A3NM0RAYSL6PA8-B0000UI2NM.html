The script may not be supremely dreadful, but it tries.  Let's just say that Underworld gives Tim Burton's remake of  Planet of the Apes a run for its money in the "Just Plain Awful" department.<p>Where to begin?  The worst part of the movie is the acting.  With the exception of Kate Beckinsale, who makes the most of a character as thinly drawn as a Saran wrap, the acting is gag-out-loud atrocious.  Worst of the lot is the actor who portrayed Kraven (yes, that's really his name), a guy named Shane Brolly whose career, we can only hope, is over.  To say that he's the worst of this sad lot means he needs to be run out of the business with a pointed stick.<p>God, I don't want to waste anymore time writing a review of this trash.  The music is loud--and bad.  The writing is cliched--and bad.  The cinematography is dark blue--and bad.  And there are so many ripoffs from other films, including spare costumes from the Matrix, that you wish that audiences could file a class action lawsuit for paying good money for this cheap rip-off.<p>Don't go.</p></body></html>

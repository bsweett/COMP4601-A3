<meta name="summary" content="An interesting story, but too derivative to be really enjoyable."></head><body><p>A biological weapon that turns people into homicidal maniacs before it kills them is accidentally released in the small town of Ogden Marsh, Iowa. A small group of survivors manages to elude soldiers and the infected long enough to make it to the edge of town, but they're a long way from safety. The Crazies follows the themes of Carriers and 28 Days Later, examining how people and politics cope with apocalyptic situations; too closely, really, to add anything new to this fascinating theme.</p></body></html>

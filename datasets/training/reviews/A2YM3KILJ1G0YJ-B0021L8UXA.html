Romero's original movie, and produced a contemporary version of The Crazies that feels like the worst parts of Outbreak and 28 Days Later combined.  Better in every single way, terrifying at every turn, this is a nail-biter, an updated horror film that does not disappoint.<br /><br />When a quiet, elder gentleman interrupts a high school baseball game by walking into centerfield toting a shotgun, the town of Ogden Marsh, Iowa is irrevocably changed.  With residents suddenly plagued by a mysterious sickness that turns them into psychopaths, the military springs into action, quarantining the entire town and attempting to stifle the outbreak by removing and immobilizing the sick.  Meanwhile, sheriff David Dutton (Olyphant), his wife (Mitchell), the town deputy, and one other fight for survival<br /><br />Despite the fact that nothing is terribly original, the movie avoids being too predictable.  Scares jump off the screen from beginning to end, and the tone of the movie is believable enough to be ominous throughout.  Some of the scenarios in which the sick bound out after our heroes are completely unexpected.  The special effects are creative enough to add well to the thrust of the film without being Michael Bay level ostentatious.  The makeup and gore are top-notch as well, with blood, brain, and viscera splattering multiple times, accompanied by my approving applause.<br /><br />Horror fans will love this movie, and I view it as redemption for an underwhelming predecessor.  I loved it from setup to explosive ending.  Be on the lookout for the pitchfork scene!  YIKES!<br /><br />Jason Elin</p></body></html>

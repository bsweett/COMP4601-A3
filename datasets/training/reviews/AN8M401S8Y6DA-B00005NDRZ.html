<meta name="summary" content="Some dvds are like people: some shine and some don't.  This hd dvd shines.  Hd dvd special features below"></head><body><p>I personally wouldn't re buy every film that comes out on Hd-dvd especially seeing as how the prices haven't really come down.  That said a film like this is an exception, I believe horror fans are some of the most die hard film fans out there, and should and will pick this one up.<br />For Audiophiles there is a new 5.1 track as opposed to the mono you got on the previous release.  The beginning score when Jack is driving to the Overlook hotel is amazing cranked up with a Dolby digital plus track in 5.1.<br />The transfer on this is beautiful.<br />The Shining is the greatest Stephen King film adapation and is one, if not the greatest of all horror films.  Also one of the greatest films for any genre and right in time for Halloween you can't go wrong.<br /><br />Special features<br /><br />- Audio commentary by Steadicam inventor Garrett Brown and Kubrick biographer John Baxter<br />- The Making of The Shining, with optional commentary by Vivian Kubrick (from the previous DVD)<br />- New View from The Overlook: Crafting The Shining featurette<br />- New The Visions of Stanley Kubrick featurette<br />- New Wendy Carlos, Composer featurette<br />-Theatrical Trailer - This was one of the most effectives and eeriest trailers I've ever seen and it was so simple.<br /><br />I'll go more in depth of the special features as I watch them.<br /><br />Technical Specs:<br />- Aspect Ratio: 1080p HD 16X9 1:85:1<br />- Audio: Dolby true HD:  English 5.1 Dolby digital plus</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="World War X"></head><body><p>In X1 there was the attempt by Magneto (played superbly by Ian McKellan) to convert humans to mutants. In X2 it was a plot by a corrupt Fed to kill all the mutants using Xavier (Patrick Stewart). In X3 a "cure" is found that makes all mutants human.<br /><br />Cure indeed. Who said the mutants were sick? Such  is the view of the mutant self proclaimed leader Magneto. Magneto fears that the "cure" will be forced upon the mutant population and wages war against the source of the cure with the aim to destroy it and anything that gets in his and his loyal followers way.<br /><br />The movie is suspenseful and exciting. No bathroom break urges in this one. New mutants are hatched and some of our favorite mutants are dispatched (quite early on in the movie). Special effects are 5-star.<br /><br />There is no need to see X1 or X2 in order to fully understand and be thoroughly entertained by X3. Hugh Jackman is back in the tough-guy roll as Wolverine (we like you better as a tough guy, Hugh); Halle Berry (Storm), Anna Paquin (Rogue), James Marsden (Cyclops) and Rebecca Romijn (Mystique) are all back too. And Famke Janssen is back as Phoenix as you've never seen her.<br /><br />Beast is in this one too actually played by (to my surprise in the rolling credits)...Kelsey Grammer! Now there's a real mutation!<br /><br />All in all a very entertaining hour and 45 minutes. X fans won't miss it. You shouldn't either if you're into the action genre.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Oh, dear."></head><body><p>This is not a good movie.<br /><br />Forget it's a remake, forget the original, forget that the concept of Hell-On-Earth has been done to death already in movies like 'The Exorcist', 'Rosemary's Baby', 'Silent Hill', and so forth. And, without all of those things to measure this effort against, 'Omen 666' still manages to be a dismal, overblown tack-fest of enormous proportions.<br /><br />The movie opens with some flashy, glitzy documentary-style shots of actual, real disasters, like 9/11 and the New Orleans flooding. Far from underlining the proposed message at the beginning of the movie - that man is contributing to his own downfall - these shots are a cheap, tawdry attempt to pull the viewer in to gain some sort of empathy with what the (it must be said) not-terribly-worried-looking Vatican Cardinals are foreseeing. I don't know about you but I'd prefer to show these disasters a little respect, not dress them up and gloss them over to serve the bland ends of movies like this one.<br /><br />The glossy, overawed sense of self-importance continues with some of the more pivotal scenes in the movie - the decapitation scene, the first time we're supposed to wonder what Damien's power is actually capable of, looks here, thanks to some Arnold-Schwarzenegger-Versus-Steven-Segal style direction, like something from a bad action flick. Damien's birthday party, the zoo sequence and the death of Father Brennan all suffer from the same waaaay over-the-top flashiness, and this simply removes all the dramatic worth of the scene, because we've seen all this done so, so many times before.<br /><br />Performance-wise there's not much on offer: Julia Stiles is a good actress, but she's out of her depth here. She doesn't seem capable of generating either the sympathy or the humanity needed for her character. Pete Postlethwaite stinks (really, REALLY stinks - I was very disappointed: he sounds like a drunken St. Patrick's Day reveller instead of a priest who knows Armageddon is at hand) and David Thewlis just looks bored. Ditto Mia Farrow: a great casting choice to play the malevolent Mrs. Blayloch, Farrow's lack of screen time and the inclusion of her 'campier' moments turn Mrs. Blayloch into something of a Light Relief. Liev Schreiber does a pretty good job as Robert Thorn, but the subtleties of his performance are lost to a less-than-average supporting cast and some truly boring, boring direction. The same can be said for Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick, who, while initially doing a good job in the role of Damien, proceeds to slap a constipated expression on his face for the latter two-thirds of the picture, and winds up eventually at Not Very Scary At All.<br /><br />This movie is not even recommended for a DVD rental, being so wholly unoriginal and over-the-top. The mawkish quality of the visuals and the frankly substandard direction are thrown into relief by the fact that director John Moore clearly thought he could add some visual frills to the style and pacing of the original movie and come up with something decent. He hasn't, and what we're left with in 'Omen 666' is a pretty feeble rendition of a potentially gripping story.<br /><br />Avoid.</p></body></html>

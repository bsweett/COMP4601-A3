<meta name="summary" content="Borat: Tasteful, Understated and Boring--NOT!"></head><body><p>Most film adaptations of TV skits seem pretty thin, being that a 10-minute idea is being stretched to 90 or more minutes.  I've never seen Sasha Baron Cohen's "Ali-G" Show on HBO, but his "Borat" character from the show did just fine in his own feature-length movie.  Much of the tale of Borat's (a Kazakh journalist's cultural adventures in the US) was unscripted, as Americans he encountered were led to believe that Borat was a legitimate journalist. Their reactions are understandable in some cases (as when Borat tries to kiss male strangers in the "traditional" Kazakh way in the subway), and just plain scary in others (as when the gun dealer recommends "a gun to kill Jews with").  The result is almost non-stop hilarity, from the Running of the Jews in Borat's hometown in Kazakhstan, to his rendition of the Kazakh national anthem ("oh glorious exporter of potassium") at a Virginia rodeo.  The movie features a lot of bathroom humor (much of it very graphic), sex humor (all talk) and hairy male body humor (much of it just gross), but you never know what's coming next--somehow it's all both direct and subtle enough to keep you both grossed out and guessing.  I wondered if Pamela Anderson knew what was coming as Borat finally catches up to the fantasy love object he sees an episode of Baywatch on his hotel TV (the word is that she did).  Borat is the funniest movie I've seen this year, and ranks with "The Meaning of Life" on my list of funniest bad taste movies of all time.</p></body></html>

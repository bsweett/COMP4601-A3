This film is an adaptation of a story by Pulitzer Prize winning author Steven Millhauser.  The excellent cinematography of Dick Pope was nominated for an Oscar, a similar award which he won from the San Diego Film Critics.  Philip Glass' score was recognized with an award by the New York Film Critics Online.  I enjoyed the acting in the film.  Edward Norton was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for "Primal Fear" in 1996 and as Best Actor in 1998 for "American History X."  His film "The Painted Veil" was touching and excellent.  As Eisenheim, Norton's performance is highly controlled, internal.  We are unable to tell if anything is reaching him, but see his desire for Sophie.  In the DVD extras, it took me a moment to recognize him without his beard.  Jessica Biel has been in two very interesting film projects, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EU1Q7M">London</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0792842189">Ulee's Gold</a>.  In the DVD extras, she says that Sophie von Teschen was a part she actively sought & was delighted to play.  Within the same week, I had purchased and watched the DVD <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VNMMQG">Amazing Grace</a>.  Rufus Sewell plays the slave reformer Clarkson with flowing long hair and totes a bag full of manacles for most of the film.  When I looked at the box for this film, I was so surprised to see the same actor.  As Crown Prince Leopold, Sewell delivers a tightly knit performance, threatening to be lethal to any around him.  The moment when he strikes Sophie almost made my blood chill.  Sophie looks at him with cold eyes and merely says, "Goodbye."  It's an excellent moment.  Paul Giamatti won a Best Actor award from the Toronto Film Critics for his breakout role in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007TKOAA">Sideways (Widescreen Edition)</a>.  He was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for "Cinderella Man" in 2005, and won a similar award that year from Screen Actors Guild.  As Chief Inspector Uhl, he will not let go of this case & is committed to following the truth, no matter where it leads.  I found the story of this film to be riveting.  It spiraled into the unknown at every turn for me.  From the almost supernatural illusions of the "ghosts" to the orange tree that mysteriously grows, I found each new performance of Eisenheim to be an adventure.  Neil Burger kept the pace moving swiftly.  The romantic childhood relationship that seems to bloom into destined lovers captured my imagination.  I enjoyed this film immensely in the theatre and have looked for an affordable used copy for awhile.  I found it!  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

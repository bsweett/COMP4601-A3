<meta name="summary" content="District 9...."></head><body><p>District 9 is a 2009 South African science fiction thriller film directed by Neill Blomkamp. It was written by Blomkamp and Terri Tatchell, and produced by Peter Jackson and Carolynne Cunningham. The film stars Sharlto Copley, Jason Cope, and David James. The story, adapted from Alive in Joburg, is a 2005 short film directed by Blomkamp and produced by Sharlto Copley and Simon Hansen.<br /><br />The story, itself, is about a large alien aircraft that stops above Johannesburg, South Africa in 1982. When an investigative team enters the ship, they find lifeforms on board starving and malnourished.  The aliens, often referred to as "prawns", are confined to District 9(a government camp just underneath the ship). Unrest occurs between the aliens and the locals which pushes the South African government to hire Multinational United (MNU), a private military company, to relocate the aliens to a new internment camp. Wikus van de Merwe is appointed to lead the camp relocation by serving the aliens with eviction notices. Meanwhile, alien Christopher Johnson, his son, and an alien friend search for alien technology from which they distill a mysterious fluid, storing it in a small canister. While raiding the shack of Christopher's friend, Wikus discovers and seizes the container, which sprays the fluid onto his face. Unfortunately, it slowly begins mutating Wikus into a prawn. This is where the real story begins.<br /><br />I have to admit, this isn't your typical sci-fi movie about aliens. What I liked most about the movie is the fact that it dealt with very real situations. My only dislike about the film is that it mostly was marred by mindless explosions and whatnot that seemed to take away from the real story beneath it all. Even though it seemed more like a political movie, it wasn't by any means. It did have its' flaws. For the most part, however, District 9 is a decent film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Unique crime film with top-notch dialogue and atmosphere."></head><body><p>There's not much left to say in praise of this film -- Gabriel Byrne and Kevin Spacey are sublime, Pete Postlethwaite a deliciously eloquent villain, Christopher McQuarrie's script an energetic, imaginative maze of  twists and conflicts, and Bryan Singer's direction rock-steady, making this  one of the most stylish films of the '90s but still packing it with enough  substance and character to back up the flair.<p>It was nice to see a crime  film that didn't ape Pulp Fiction, instead carving out its own niche as a  cerebral, eloquent film about betrayal, deception, fear, redemption (or the  impossibility of redemption), and identity.  One of the grandest tricks in  The Usual Suspects is to create a thoroughly winning hero, yet forcing you  to applaud the ingenuity of the victorious villains at the end.<p>A high  point in '90s cinema.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Mama Mia is right!"></head><body><p>I know this review will be an unpopular one, so I am prepared for the many "not helpful" votes this will get.  Take your best shot.  That being said ...<br /><br />Yikes.  I have always been a Streep fan, but I have never seen anything like this.  I don't know what they did to her, but throughout most of this film - I will blame the director, choreographer and editors - she is so manically jubilant and expressive and hyper-active that I was afraid the poor woman had developed an addiction to chrystal meth!<br /><br />In fact, most of the cast fairs poorly.  Only Julie Walters seems to realize that she is in the midst of one enormous joke.  For all the mania and energy forced upon these people, their dealiest flaw is that they seem to be taking this whole story seriously.<br /><br />The term "Greek Chorus" has never been so horrifyingly real.  Words cannot express.<br /><br />Two stars though because I can see a future rainy Sunday with tequila shots lined up on the coffee table, a double feature of Mama Mia! and Can't Stop the Music, and a really big headache afterward. Now that's fun!.</p></body></html>

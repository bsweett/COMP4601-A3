Even knowing that it's based on a true story -- built from accounts, according to Spielberg, which could not be discredited -- I half-expected a James Bond over-the-top action/adventure.  I should have known that Spielberg would not stoop to cheap gimmicks and corny action cliches.<br /><br />More than the action is the drama.  The characters have to confront the evil that was done in Munich in 1972.  The are forced to reflect on whether they're right in their response to that evil.  Without melodrama, Spielberg brings these issues to the surface, plays them out through credible interaction between the various characters.<br /><br />The lone drawback of this movie is that it tends to drag at the end. It never gets boring, but it seems like some fat could possibly have been trimmed out somewhere.  This is a minor point as there's nothing in the movie that obviously does not fit.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It's not so complicated"></head><body><p>The plot is much simpler than anything I've read in the reviews.  A woman is dying of cancer so she writes a book about death being the necessary step to a new birth.  She wants the love of her life, her scientist husband, to understand what she has learned while researching history and the cultural and religious perspectives of life, death, and the journey beyond.  To ensure he reaches her goal for him, she gives him the manuscript and a task, a task he is reminded about constantly throughout the film.  Her perspective was the past.  His perspective is the future and a completely different cultural, religious frame of reference.  Does he complete the task?  Watch the movie and the answer is obvious.<br /><br />The magic in the movie is the way the story of her book and his attempt to complete the task is interwoven into the reality of their life.  It's not so mysterious; it is beautifully expressed and it will touch all those who know the power of two loves evolving over time into an inseparable oneness.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Terrific Revenge Film"></head><body><p>Denzel Washington plays a terrific redemption role as bodyguard Creasy in this revenge thriller: Man on Fire.<br /><br />With a nose for the truth and killer instincts only somewhat deadened by alcohol, Creasy fulfills his responsiblities to guard a precocious young girl, Peta. When he is crossed and double-crossed, he prepares to do his worst: interrogation and revenge on a large scale.<br /><br />The ending provides twists and turns but the strength of this film lies in its unabashed primary motive: revenge. And it is dastardly, effective, and sweet.</p></body></html>

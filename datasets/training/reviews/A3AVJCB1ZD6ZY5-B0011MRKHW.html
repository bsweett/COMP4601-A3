<meta name="summary" content="One of the most beautifully filmed movies I've ever seen"></head><body><p>The sets, the costumes, the sheer beauty of the landscape is enough to earn this film a 5 star rating.  Parts of this film were so gloriously done they inspired the awe I feel looking at an illuminated text with the gorgeous gold leaf border and kid smooth binding.<br /><br />Cate Blancett was stellar as an aging Queen Elizabeth, coping with the decline of her fertility while she still had to play the game of trying to find a suitable man to sit beside her on the throne.  Her wit dealing with Sir Walter Raleigh had everyone in the theatre laughing at one particular line regarding Raleigh's proposed name for his colony.  Her quandary over dealing with Mary, Queen of Scots was touching--what should she have done with a kinswoman and Queen.  Her leadership during war was inspiring.<br /><br />I do not have sufficient scholarship in English history to comment on the verity of the romantic storyline with Sir Walter Raleigh. The general accounts are true, whether they were over-stated for film purposes or not should be determined by someone with more knowledge than I.<br /><br />I will say the film was very worth attending and I'm glad to have seen it full screen in a theatre.  While modern home technology does do a fine job of rendering films--there's nothing to compare with a large-scale screen for the more gorgeously filmed movies.<br /><br />I'm predicting at least a nomination for Blancett as Elizabeth as well as for the costumers, set designers and cinematographers.  This may well be a movie to buy when it comes out--particularly if you have the capability to really showcase this gorgeous film.</p></body></html>

It takes place seven years after the first film and a horribly disfigured man and his aid are interrogating a man who was an employee at the asylum where Hannibal Lecter was kept. The disfigured and crippled man is a wealthy man who in his younger days was a child molester.  Hannibal ( Anthony Hopkins) was appointed as his court appointed therapist and Hannibal left him disfigured and wheel chair bound.<br /><br />The disfigured man is Mason Verger (Gary Oldman) and he is trying to find out all he can about Hannibal and Agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore).  At the end of the interview the asylum worker offers to sell Mason a piece of Hannibal Lecter memorabilia and he sells Hannibal's face mask for $250,000.<br /><br />Agent Starling is managing a huge bust of a drug ring and the apprehension of a female habitual criminal.  When the woman walks out of the warehouse she is guarded by three men and carrying a baby in a shoulder harness.  Starling calls off the bust but one of the local cops draws his gun and a street war breaks out.  The entire operation looks bad as Starling is shown carrying away a baby covered in blood and 5 people are killed.  Since she was in charge she takes the blame for the embarrassment to the FBI and other federal agencies involved in the bust that has gone bad.<br /><br />Mason Verger uses his wealth and influence at the justice department to get Starling reassigned to the recapture Hannibal Lecter.  His goal is to capture and kill Lecter as revenge for his torture, disfigurement and his being crippled......<br /><br />This is a very good movie for many reasons but unfortunately it is a sequel to a super top rated Silence of the Lambs film and it was not rated as highly as it should have been because of that.  This movie is well filmed and the cinematography is just spectacular from the scenes outside of the Verger mansion to the scenes shot in Italy.  It is also a detailed and macabre story and may be too intense for some people.<br /><br />The acting in this film is top notch and Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling did a wonderful job of replacing Jodie Foster in this role.  Every actor in this movie plays their role to perfection and this is what made this movie first class.<br /><br />I enjoyed this story and the movie for many reasons.  It is really a good film and worth watching.  I recommend it to you.  Just be aware it is gruesome and has several horrific scenes in it.  It is not for the weak of heart.</p></body></html>

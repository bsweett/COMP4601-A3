<meta name="summary" content="4 ? Stars: Arguably Dario Argento's Best Film; the Opening Chapter in the "3 Mothers" Trilogy..."></head><body><p>The Italian maestro of horror, Dario Argento's first installment of his "Three Mothers" trilogy begins with "SUSPIRIA" (1977); arguably the most beloved of his films in the 1970s. There has always been debate among his fan base whether this film or "Deep Red" is his masterpiece. Some say it should be "Tenebre". For me, I am still somewhat undecided. I like his psychological "giallos" as much a his occult films. Whatever you prefer, "Susperia" is a dark fairy tale that will forever be remembered in the journals of horror films.<br /><br />One dark, dank and stormy night, an American ballet dancer named Susie Banyon (Jessica Harper) arrives in a ballet school in Freiburg. This European ballet school is ran by a mysterious woman named Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett) and Miss Tanner (Alida Valli). A number of mysterious deaths and horrific crimes begin to occur in the school shortly after her arrival. Apparently, they are linked to the school itself; while the area on which the school stands on has a relation to a certain "Black Queen", a practitioner of the dark arts of the occult and witchcraft.<br /><br />The film's plot is quite light when compared to "Deep Red" or even "Tenebre", but this fact doesn't make this film any less eerie or suspenseful. From the opening act the film exudes a dark and moody feel, Argento's magnificent eye for visuals are at its best. It took me at least two viewings to truly appreciate "Suspiria". The use of vibrant colors I've read became a revolutionary palette for the horror maestro, and to think that he used obsolete Technicolor film rolls to shoot his film.<br /><br />The first act of the film remains as one of the most memorable sequences in horror. The opening act's death scene is truly violent and very "artsy"; that it grabs the viewer by the throat just to let him know what he is in for. This is a familiar formula for Dario Argento, as displayed in "Tenebre" and "Deep Red". Most of his films display a shocking murder and/or death sequence as "shock value". The director really does know how to get under one's skin with an unnerving sensation. It is quite curious that Argento (with co-writer Daria Nicolodi) owes his inspiration for "Suspiria" from a Disney animation--"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs". I've read that the film was originally intended to use a children's school as its backdrop but for reasons unknown to me, that idea was abandoned. (perhaps it would generate too much controversy?)<br /><br />"Suspiria" has a decent share of ominous atmosphere. Argento uses vibrant colors, intimidating and spooky architecture, the use of shadows, combined with Goblin's ominous music all contribute to the film's effectively creepy screenplay. The film also applies some lore from witchcraft and the occult as it takes a look at the mythology about witchcraft. Food does spoil a lot faster when it is within the confines of witches, at least according to legend. I do think the director has a certain curiosity about witches that led him to create one, if not the most involving tales about the subject. The scientific definition of the occult is also defined which adds to the film's credibility. Daria Nicolodi is to be credited for some of the film's creative inputs as she supposedly told Argento about her grandmother who had a similar experience in a school that practiced black magic. Whether this is fact or a rumor I would not know.<br /><br />The performances by the cast is quite decent but not entirely flawless. Jessica Harper does give a decent performance but I rather thought that she lacked some chemistry with Stefania Casini. Nonetheless, Argento is able to make this a very minor setback as he bombards the screen with his signature ingenious camerawork along with cinematographer Luciano Tovoli. I was in awe as to how the death of the blind piano player was set up. It was suspenseful and freaky, with great use of pans, reverse zooms, close-ups and moving shadows. Aside from the opening's death scene, this would be my favorite sequence in the film. Argento is a master of simple visual manipulation. I was a little disappointed that this installment had no nudity but I supposed it fit the film's pace. There are quite a few gruesome scenes carefully placed in the film's proceedings.  "Suspiria" has definite Giallo influences in its opening marks just before it goes into overdrive.<br /><br />Dario Argento may have more style in his supernatural films. His Giallos and his occult films are like apples and oranges, they`re both good but can`t be compared. Regardless, however you may feel about "Suspiria", whether this is your first Argento film or you're a big fan; the creative death sequences, the maggot attack (or shower), the dog mauling are stuff that are truly noteworthy in the film. For a film made in 1977, it is way ahead of its time. The use of colors, manipulation of the senses and very creepy atmosphere make this film one of Dario Argento's most celebrated works, and it still holds up to this present time.<br />Highly Recommended! [4 ? Stars]<br /><br />The 2-disc 25th Anniversary Dvd by Blue Underground has a THX-Certified re-mastered picture and the sound mix has both 5.1 Dolby Digital and 5.1 DTS. For a film made in 1977, it looks real pretty.</p></body></html>

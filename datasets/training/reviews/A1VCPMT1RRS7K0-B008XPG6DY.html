Jennifer Anniston, who I am not into, looked a bit better than usual in this particular movie. This is really the first time I've seen her play a "big girl" role.  She's not quite leading-lady material, but she holds her own.<br /><br />The story/plot is taken directly from police file stories of real scams run on unsuspecting men and women.  It is interesting to see it played out on-screen, especially since I wasn't expecting it.  I really though Anniston's character was into Clive Owen's character.<br /><br />This is a decent movie.  There is nothing too memorable about it, but it is worth seeing once.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Totally unexpected ending"></head><body><p>When watching a movie by Quentin Tarantino there are certain things one comes to expect.  This movie provides most of them.<br /><br />1.  Large amounts of blood and violence.  This movie is very violent.  If you want to see people brained with batch, scalped and slashed to a point where it attempts to desensitize you then this is the picture for you.<br /><br />2.  Interesting Villains:  Tarantino's film got a lot of good press in Germany, mostly because it portrays Germans and Nazi in a much more sympathetic way then we have seen.  We see men conflicted by killing, unwilling to save their own lives to compromise others.  As for the primary villain although his own evil is established early he is portrayed more as a German Holmens than a simple Nazi slaying Jews.<br /><br />3.  Violent Heroes:  The Americans in this movie are very violent as are their allies, they are Jews getting revenge and they aren't shy about getting it.<br /><br />4.  Offbeat comedy:  A lot of what happens is presented in a comical fashion.  You will find yourself laughing at times that will surprise you.<br /><br />If these elements are not to your liking, you won't care for the film, if they are you will enjoy it.<br /><br />and might I add the ending totally surprised me.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Die Another Day Best Bond Ever?"></head><body><p>The highly-anticipated entry into the James Bond franchise, appropriatly titled DIE ANOTHER DAY, is being touted by many as the best James Bond film ever. Film-goers are perhaps setting their expectations a bit too high, but there is little doubt that the 20th outing of the debonair British secret agent will clean up at the box office come November 22. Pierce Brosnan returns for the fourth time as 007, along with returning cast members Judi Dench as M, John Cleese (Q) and Samantha Bond as Moneypenny. From the previews and trailers, it looks set to be a great action ride filled with homages to earlier Bond films (Halle Berry as the seductive villian Jinx is very similar to Ursula Andress in DR NO). After the overly-glossy THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH, one hopes that this entry will match the very high bar set by 1995's GOLDENEYE. Director Lee Tamahori (Along Came A Spider, TV's Sopranos) is an excellent choice for such a fast-paced and exciting action film. But action alone won't make this a sure-fire winner. Since the film-makers ran out of Ian Flemming books to base the movies on, things have been somewhat shaky, especially with TOMORROW NEVER DIES. Goldeneye, TND and TWINE have all had impressive action, but lack the charm and wit of earlier films (Bond gets wet from a female water-skier, she says "I've got you all wet" and Bond's sly retort is "Yes, but my martini's still dry"). It's classic lines and oft-quoted innuendos that make a great Bond film great. And of course, the man himself, Mr Brosnan, who, depsite being involved in the last two so-so entries, has hardened his performance and he's looking great in this one, which many people are getting very excited about. Plus more good news, 007 is ditching the Bema for the classic Aston Martin! And David Arnold returns to compose the film's score (Brilliant!). But specultion aside, we can only hope that it will be as exciting and cool as the classic Bond films of the 60s. Like many fans, I am waiting with great anticipation...</p></body></html>

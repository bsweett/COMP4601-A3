The book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307454541">The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</a>, is on my reading list, but I was talked into watching this movie so I could go with family to see the next movie in this series.  Since books tend to be even better, I have something to look forward to.<br /><br />Journalist Mikael Blomkvist takes an assignment with a wealthy capitalist to solve a 40 year old mystery... who killed the capitalist's niece?  Through a totally believable series of events, Blomkvist pairs up with the strange young woman, Lisbeth Salander.  Salander is an extraordinarily unique individual.  They uncover human monsters and unravel an extraordinary mystery.<br /><br />I can't wait to see that next movie.  And I've still got the books to read!<br /><br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

It's definately not a "who dunnit" film; you know Costner is a serial killer. It's more of a character study. MB is clever with subtle (and dark) humor. There were aspects of the plot that seemed a bit disjointed but it holds together reasonably well. I think they cheesed the ending a little bit, however.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

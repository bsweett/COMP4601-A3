<meta name="summary" content="A very good job of personifying the penguins, helped by"></head><body><p>Morgan Freeman's narration. It is a year in the life of Emperor Penguins. Their life, like all animals is dictated by their environment. Antartica does have distinct seasons & during their summer, it can be quite habitable. But not winter with it's eternal darkness. The penguins endure. There must be quite a few of them since we are told that only 10% of the chicks survive. They fall victim to cold, starvation, predators & loss of either one of thier parents. A more nuturing father in the animal kingdom you may never see. All march from their feeding area to their breeding area maybe up to 70 miles. Shortly after  mating the mother lays one single egg she transfers it to the  father. This in itself is a pains-<br />takingly slow process & many eggs crack & perish. Once sucessful,the father sits on the eggs for several months in the dead of winter while mom leaves to feed. Dad is unable to feed all this time. In several months the mothers that have survived their own ordeals return, fat with full bellies to feed their chicks. They grow fast & soon all trek back to the feeding grounds. At this point, the families break up, never to reunite. The adults return to the sea. The chicks are left & of course eventually they go for their first swim. The sea is, after all the penguins natural habitat. The young penguins will stay for 4-5 years, at which time they too will pursue a life cycle of marches.</p></body></html>

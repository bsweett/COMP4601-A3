<meta name="summary" content="Constantine"></head><body><p>Yet another comic book movie graces the big screen in the adaptation of DC Comics's "Constantine".  John Constantine (Reeves) is cursed with the ability to see angels and demons in the world around us.  And they are everywhere.  As a child, he tried to kill himself rather than deal with what he saw.  He was unsuccessful, and now he is trying to atone for his suicide and win God's favor so that he may enter heaven upon his death.  Constantine does not really have faith though, and he finds himself tormented to one degree or another by the angel Gabriel (Swinton) and the demon Balthazar (Rossdale).  Oh yeah, and he has terminal lung cancer.  If that is not enough of a downer, Satan's son is trying to enter the "real world" and mess everything up.  With the help of Angela Dodson (Weisz), a Los Angeles cop, he just might be able to stop him, but it will not be easy.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves is still in "Matrix" mode, and Constantine is not too different from Neo, the character he played three times.  Unfortunately, that character is growing tiresome.  Reeves definately needs a more upbeat movie to work on next.  Swinton does a good job as the androgenyous angel Gabriel, helping and tormenting poor Constantine at the same time.  The real scene stealer is Peter Stormare as Satan himself.  Played with creepy glee, one wishes that he had more screen time.  "Constantine" also does not feel like it is playing fair at times, bending the rules that it has set up for the supernatural forces.  My suggestion is to wait for the DVD.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Worth seeing with some caveats!"></head><body><p>First of all, I have to confess I'll see nearly  ANY movie with John Cusack in it. I'm not sure what it is about him as an actor that holds my attention but after seeing him in a wide range of films, I find his versatiliy, his ability to play a broad spectrum of characters and to keep  pushing the envelope and explore new territory to be intriguing. Don't get me wrong - I don't have a crush on him. He's an actor. I'm a reviewer - don't know the guy.<br /><br />Now, ABOUT THIS MOVIE. I read the short story in King's collection and have to say that the movie takes lots of creative liberties but that's fine by me. It holds true to the essence of the story. I happen to like this in book form better but that is because it's taut and doesn't waste words. Besides, it is easier to linger on a certain passage, until it is seared into the imagination.<br /><br />  Still, the movie has its fine points as well. As mentioned before, there is John Cusack, who definitely comes across as a skeptical writer who becomes genuinely spooked by his experiences in Room 1408. His acting is as interesting as usual, pulling out all the stops, with those quirky facial movements that can suggest so much about a character without saying a word.<br /><br />I found the special effects to be less impressive and the movie seemed to go on forever. But that's my main problem with adaptations of King books to screen. Sometimes they work beautifully and other times they fall flat. I think this one is somewhere in the middle.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Grindhouse" Returns!"></head><body><p>SOME SPOILERS<br /><br />Some years back, Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez decided to create an homage to the low-budget, high-absurdity midnight cinema, a project they called GRINDHOUSE, after the dirty, popcorn-and-candy-bar-wrapper-strewn, soda-sticky floored, torn screen movie theaters known by that name. Grindhouses usually showed 86 minute double features with names like PELVIS and THE CARS THAT EAT PEOPLE. They sustained themselves with showings of THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW and THE GRATEFUL DEAD MOVIE, ignoring the pungent smells of marijuana and "locker room" that permeated the seating area, along with cheap wine and beer and vomit---Yes, you can tell, I was there, I admit it. The films grindhouses showed had badly scratched blobby prints that hummed and jumped their sprockets. The third reel sometimes came in the middle, depending on the relative sobriety of the projectionist.<br /><br />Tarantino and Rodriguez's homage included a double feature, PLANET TERROR and DEATH PROOF, and a number of Coming Attractions, among which was MACHETE, a movie simply rip-roaring with silly stereotypes, cartoonish violence, and an absurd plotline.<br /><br />MACHETE's star, Danny Trejo, is an American success story. After completing a now-long ago prison stint, Trejo began acting, at first staring in Andy Sidaris movies. His stone-cold scarred visage has graced many action films since.<br /><br />MACHETE is the story of a former Mexican Federale, nicknamed after his favorite weapon, whose family is killed by a drug kingpin, Mr. Torrez (played by Steven Seagal). Swearing eventual vengeance, Machete manages to escape by swimming the Rio Grande, taking up residence in Texas as an undocumented alien working as a gardener---What else???<br /><br />He is approached by a businessman, Booth (Jeff Fahey), who hires him to kill the ultra-conservative Texas Senator McLaughlin (played like a rabid LBJ by Robert DeNiro), who enjoys hunting down and shooting border crossers in company with Von (Don Johnson), the head of a self-appointed vigilante Border Guard unit (the bad guys in MACHETE are all played by Norteamericanos).<br /><br />Machete takes the upfront money he gets for shooting the Senator, and donates it to "The Network" a shadowy organization founded by the mysterious She, that aids undocumented aliens and others in need. "We help everybody" says Luz (the blazingly hot Michelle Rodriguez), who runs The Network from the back of a taco truck, providing money, health care, and lessons in self-defense to the disenfranchised people whom she protects. The idea of class warfare runs like a raging torrent through MACHETE.<br /><br />Although Machete never shoots the Senator, someone else does (in the leg), and Machete is blamed for the assassination attempt (in the wake of Tucson, the whole "shoot the Senator" subplot has become eerie). Now a hunted man, Machete vows to find out why and by whom he is being framed. He quicky allies himself with Luz, and with FBI Agent Rivera (Jessica Alba). He sleeps with both of them. He also sleeps with Booth's wife and drunken, drug-addled daughter (played by Lindsay Lohan, who was hardly acting) at the same time. Lohan ends the film wearing a nun's habit---talk about over the top!!!.<br /><br />Machete discovers that the whole shooting incident was carefully orchestrated by Booth, McLaughlin, Von and Torrez, who want to reduce the number of illegals in the U.S. in order to drive up drug demand, agricultural prices and service costs, and hence profits, in the companies they own. They can't find Machete, but they kill his brother, a Father played by Cheech Marin, by nastily crucifying him in his own church.<br /><br />Machete goes on a rampage, slashing and chopping his way through the rich mens' minions. The blood flies, often spattering the camera lenses. He escapes capture by cutting open a killer's belly, grabbing a handful of the guy's small intestines, and using it like an escape rope. In his gardener's role, he weed-whacks a few bad guys to death, impales a few more, and basically spreads gore like Christmas cheer.<br /><br />While doing so, he raises an army of Latino farm workers who attack the Booth-McLauglin-Von-Torrez forces in low-riders with blaring radios and bouncy suspensions, fruit trucks, and landscapers' pickups. In the end, the real supporters of American democracy win.<br /><br />It's simply hyperbolic, but, despite its clownishness, MACHETE does say something meaningful to the audience.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED</p></body></html>

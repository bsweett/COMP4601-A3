The scene where Denzel's Lucas burns the $50,000 Chinchilla coat said it all for me.  See what happen's when you show off?  You draw unwanted attention to  yourself!  Lucas was on top of the world and still ended up in jail, his family in ruins.  Great film (and object lesson) for the interested.<br /><br />I rate this movie: 5 stars!</p></body></html>

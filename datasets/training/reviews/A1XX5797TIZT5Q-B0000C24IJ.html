<meta name="summary" content="Ordinary, slow-moving.  Unworthy of Eliza Dushku's talents."></head><body><p>Wrong Turn gets a semi-favorable assessment in my view because director Rob Schmidt isn't quite as desperate to show off camera trickery as most of his modern-horror peers, like William Malone.<p>That doesn't make Wrong Turn a good horror movie.  As a chase/adventure movie it fares okay, but you won't feel any of the gut-wrenching sense of doom that you'll get from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Night of the Living Dead.  For one thing, the characters talk too much, as if constantly afraid that we won't know what they're trying to do.  Their exploration of the cannibals' house is obviously ripped off from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but it contains none of the freakish horror of that horror classic because of the characters' running commentary.  They are also not an interesting bunch to watch because of their complete lack of back story.  Not even the enormous charisma of Eliza Dushku can rescue this one, because aside from the fact that she's on the rebound, we know nothing about her character Jessie other than that she's capable of feeling fear and can fight back if she needs to.  Hardly the stuff of complex, engaging characterization.  The other characters fare no better.  Lead Desmond Harrington is colourless and uninteresting, and Emmanuelle Chriqui as Carly is especially irritating, just begging to be killed off but unfortunately keeps on surviving.<p>The worst part about the film, though, is the makeup.  The cannibals in this film look more goofy than horrifying.  One glimpse at Texas Chainsaw Massacre's Leatherface and there's no comparison.  Makeup whiz Stan Winston scored poorly this time, and he isn't helped by Schmidt's crafting of these characters into grunting, giggling, monkey-like boys who just don't command respect.  They can kill three dozen more people in this film and we still wouldn't be that scared, not in the same way as we're scared by The Shape, Leatherface, or Damien.<p>A semi-adequate horror film, free of the ridiculous bells and whistles of its contemporaries, but still missing the mark.</p></body></html>

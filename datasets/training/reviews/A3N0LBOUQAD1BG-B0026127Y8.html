<meta name="summary" content="An extreme take over..."></head><body><p>Possible spoilers<br /><br />Action films when done right can be a great form of escapism, (The "Die Hard" Films, "Face/Off") however some are just plain bad, ("Wanted" anyone?).<br /><br />"Taken" is a very and I mean very bare bones action flick that stars Liam Neeson ("Les Miserables" "Batman Begins") as Bryan Mills a retired government agent who goes to look for the men who took his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace, "The Fog" and T.V.'s "Lost") while she and a friend were on a trip in Paris.<br /><br />Mills finds out from a longtime friend of his that these men take young traveling girls and sell them as prositutes on the black market. So with this information and a ticking clock off Mills goes.<br /><br />After the first 30-35 minutes, the film is mainly one action sequence after another as Mills' search for his daughter takes him all over Paris and other parts of France, I'm guessing at least since a lot of loactions were never fully specified.<br /><br />There's a really cool chase scene throughout a construction site where some men are holding some of the girls. Almost every action portion involves Mills using skills he learned over the years (basically how to kill) to get information and take down people to get his daughter back.<br /><br />The action is great, fast paced and of course mostly ridiculous. The rest of the cast is made up of mostly throwaway characters and stereotypical bad guys, though Famke Janssen has a small role as Mills ex-wife and of course is Kim's mother.<br /><br />Personally as silly and goofy as the film can be and is, it's a ton of fun and flies by quickly though given the 85 minutes running time it's not suprising. If you want non-stop bare bones action pick up "Taken" and enjoy. 3.5 out of 4 stars.</p></body></html>

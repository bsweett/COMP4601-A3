<meta name="summary" content="Duel Of The Titans, At Last!"></head><body><p>For the first time we get to witness the two finest actors in cinematic history in the same exact film. Even though both Pacino and De Niro had stared in the same film, Godfather Part 2, they were never in the same scenes. Here in Michael Mann's Electrifying Film "Heat" we get the honor of having them both together...though only for 10 min. Still there is so much more to the movie that will want you to revisit this film again and again.<br /><br />In Heat Pacino plays a cop, one that is so devoted to his work, that he barely has time for his wife and stepdaughter. The issue between his family is so grave that it's sinking him personally. To make matters worse, a professional thief (De Niro) has established a team to steal bearer bonds from a bank, and re sell them at a certain percentage, promising the bank that they will have a high investment. Pacino's character is so into this thief that he will do the impossible to take him down.  But wait, there is more, De Niro will prepare a smart maneuver to prepare what to me is the best heist in a movie.<br /><br />Heat is magnificently directed by Michael Mann, this is by far his best movie. the cinematography is so realistic and in your face. The action is choreographed and presented with out any flaws whatsoever. The Plot is crafted intelligently and by the book, with slick dialogue and clever editing.<br /><br />Unfortunately Heat is not without flaws, the movie has a double edge sword. The movie's pace can be at times very slow. I sometimes was eagerly awaiting for something to blow up...still that is what makes the picture so amazing, the pace...you need to listen and pay attention to the lines...its written so you can re-view the film and appreciate it more. The best part aside from the heist is the meeting between Pacino and De Niro at a restaurant. The dialogue is so well written. The best line by Pacino is "if I'm there and I gotta put you away, I won't like it. But I tell you, if it's between you and some poor bastard whose wife you're gonna turn into a widow, brother, you are going down."<br /><br />This is definitely a movie to own by all means. The only thing I advice is to pay attention and to have patience with it. It can be slow, but the action is sure there, and it delivers, to the max.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 5 OUT OF 5</p></body></html>

It is based on a video game of the same name and it has really become a cult type of zombie film.  A beautiful woman named Alice wakes up in a large mansion and doesn't know who she is or where she is.  She is really an guard for the Umbrella Corporation which is the largest company in the USA.  They are also a company deeply involved in military technology and viral weaponry.<br /><br />A deadly mutating virus has been released and the massive hidden facility below the ground is being shut down with all of the employees trapped inside. It is located under the mansion where Alice is. Alice is a guard who was living in the mansion which really is the entrance to the facility called the Hive.  As she wanders about trying to recognize where she is at as a group of commandos break into the mansion.....<br /><br />This movie is just constant action and suspense.  The commandos and Alice try to reenter the Hive to see what has happened only to find out that the mutating T-Virus has escaped and the Hive's employees are infected.  In addition, several of the Hives experimental creatures have escaped. Alice and the commandos are now trapped in the hive with no way to escape and they are being attacked by the creatures and Hive's employees who are now zombies.  This movie is filled with high tech special effects and it is an excellent horror story with zombies and monsters galore.  If you like scary movies with a high tech theme then this is a good film for you.  I enjoyed and I recommend it to you.</p></body></html>

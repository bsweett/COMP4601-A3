Born in a moment when the gates between this world and a dimension of evil stood open, his intended purpose was evil. But one of those strange chances from which action films are made catapults the newborn demon into the arms of Professor Trevor Bruttenholm (John Hurt). A candy bar later, Hellboy (Ron Perlman) is a convert to the side of good.<br /><br />Too grotesque to fit into society, massively strong and completely impulsive, Hellboy becomes a demon hunter. But he continually skirts the edge of exposure, and his brash and extreme attitude are a trial to his foster father and the agents who fund and support the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense.<br /><br />When Grigori Rasputin (Karl Roden) returns to the living with the single purpose of once more forcing open the gates to evil, Hellboy joins fish man Abe Sapiens in an effort to track the evil down to its source, and, with a massive display of special effects, turn back the dark.<br /><br />The love interest (there has to be one) is Liz Sherman (Selma Blair). Like Hellboy and Abe, Liz is special. If she loses control of herself explosive fires happen - buildings burn down. Hellboy loves her, but is acutely aware of his limitations. Liz, is afraid of the power of love, fearful of what she might do in a moment of passion. Hellboy (who is inflammable) would seem to be a perfect fit, but there is a tender dysfunctionality to their relationship.<br /><br />The effects are spectacular with wild creature chases, subway chases, mortuary chases, transformations and an entire collection of onderful sets. But the film really has much more to offer than its eye-candy. The script, which could easily have become a string of banalities, has real meat to it, and the central characters may be impossible, but they are entirely believable. Director Guillermo del Toro has found the heart of an action film and created an inadvertant classic.<br /><br />Make a point of seeing this. You will find countless goodies on the side, including extended commentaries.</p></body></html>

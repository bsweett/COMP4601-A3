Bruce Campbell (The Evil Dead) plays Elvis, who switched places with an Elvis impersonator, intending to reclaim the throne after he'd had a breath of fresh air, but the impersonator topped himself. Ossie Davis (no introduction necessary) is John F. Kennedy, forced into obscurity by a government plot and dyed black to stop anyone from recognizing him. The two of them have to stop a thousands-year-old mummy who's taken up residence at their rest home in order to feed on the energy of the dying. Based on a story by Joe R. Lansdale (The Two-Bear Mambo, Act of Love, etc.) and written and directed by Don Coscarelli (only his third big-screen offering outside the Phantasm dynasty in the past twenty-five years). I mean, you can't go wrong.<p>Not to say the movie doesn't have problems. The more surreal the script, the better Coscarelli works with it (witness the brilliance of the original Phantasm, one of the finest horror movies of all time); conversely, the more "real" a script is, well, the less it ends up working. (Phantasm III, for example, with its long, slow stretches of exposition.) Coscarelli has gotten better at same over the years; what the movie is really about is Elvis and JFK, and how two guys who are both certifiable bond in the face of a crisis. There's still loads of exposition, but it moves by more quickly than usual with Coscarelli. Campbell and Davis seem to work well together, though the two of them don't really have the chemistry to make the bond believable.<p>That can be overlooked with the acting talent in here. Aside from Davis and Campbell, there are wonderful minor roles offered up by Ella Joyce (of Roc fame), Reggie Bannister (Phantasm), Heidi Marnhout (Phantasm IV), Daniel Roebuck (who may do many things, but will always be remembered as the murderer in River's Edge), and Bob Ivy as The Beaver... erm, Bubba Ho-Tep (continuing the "let's cast a stuntman as the monster" phase in horror films). The dialogue is quick, witty, and just this side of completely off the wall (as is to be expected from Mr. Lansdale). It's got all the hallmarks of really good low-budget horror.<p>But the real treat here is in the DVD extras. Loads of commentary, a couple of mini-docos, the "Brian Tyler plays everything" music video (Tyler, a new wunderkind whose credits include Darkness Falls, Frailty, and Vampires: Los Muertos, about which the music was the only decent thing, looks startlingly enough like Lansdale I thought he was the one playing the instruments), Joe Lansdale reading a piece of the original story (with the accompanying bits of film relevant), and more. A lovely treatment that more films should get. *** ?</p></body></html>

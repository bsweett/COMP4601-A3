<meta name="summary" content="Sahara"></head><body><p>Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt finally comes back to the big screen in the form of Matthew McConaughey.  He is a treasure hunter of sorts, working for the National Underwater and Marine Agency, and aided by good friend Al Giordino (Zahn).  Dirk has been looking for a lost Civil War boat -- in Africa -- for a while.  His boss, Admiral Sandecker (Macy) and Al both think he is crazy, but still he presses on.<br /><br />Eva Rojas (Cruz) is a doctor for the World Health Organization, looking for the source of a new plague in Africa.  Pitt show up in time to save her life, and since they are working in the same area, they decide to team up.  Of course, things are more than they initially seem, and soon Pitt finds himself in the position of having to save the world.<br /><br />"Sahara" stretches the boundaries of believeability, but that is not the movie's fault so much as the source material's.  Clive Cussler novels have a tendency for over the top story lines, but that is part of their charm -- much like James Bond movies.  "Sahara" the movie is a little lighter in tone than the novel, and perhaps that is why the story seems far-fetched at times.<br /><br />McConaughey and Zahn convincingly portray life long friends and adventurers, even if they would not seem like the best choice to fill Cussler's characters.  Their relationship is the centerpiece of the movie, and it is very funny at times.  Cruz is bland as the love interest, and adds little to the movie.  Macy is his usual great self as the grumbling Sandecker.  "Sahara" is a surprisingly entertaining movie.  I had some worries after seeing the trailers, given that I have read all the books, but director Breck Eisner pulls it off.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the chances for a sequel are slim to none despite the amount of material available from Clive Cussler.  During the production of the movie, the producers and Cussler had a falling out over the direction the film was heading and there are lawsuits pending.  My recommendation is to enjoy this Dirk Pitt adventure, because it might be the last for a while.</p></body></html>

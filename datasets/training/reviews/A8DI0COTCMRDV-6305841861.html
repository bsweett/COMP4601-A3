<meta name="summary" content="A PERFECT BALANCE OF COMEDY & HORROR !"></head><body><p>Sam Raimi's 2nd installment to the EVIL DEAD series is absolutely out of control! This is truely one of the best horror comedies ever made by far! Simpley because the SCARY parts are very very scary & the FUNNY parts are very very funny & Sam Raimi once again goes nuts with the camera. This is one of my all time favorites!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Impressive, Dark Sci-Fi Thriller"></head><body><p>If you're into the darker side of sci-fi, you will probably enjoy this foray into pseudo-reality.  Directed by Alex Proyas (The Crow), this was somewhat of a sleeper film that encouraged viewers to question their reality a full year before Matrix-mania hit the silver screen. <p>Although the film lacks the action or pizzaz of The Matrix, certain parallels between the two films are inevitable due to the aspect of humans being controlled by an outside force (in this case, a race of aliens inhabiting the bodies of deceased humans) and not even being aware of it.  The visual feel of the film is totally different from the Matrix, however, as Proyas takes chooses a low-key, seedy art-deco look for his film as opposed to the Matrix's brighter, monochromatic post-modern aura.<p>Some relatively big names participate in the cast, although curiously, not in the lead role.  Relative unknown Rufus Sewell plays the lead role effectively although not spectacularly, while William Hurt, a pre-Beautiful Mind Jennifer Connelly, and a pre-24 Kiefer Sutherland round out the cast in this well-written and directed feature.  <p>Although the situations are about as far removed from reality as one can get, the viewer empathizes with the main character's confusion and rejoices in the revelation that he has the ability to liberate captive humanity from its oppressors.  A fine film, and one worth a repeat viewing now and again.</p></body></html>

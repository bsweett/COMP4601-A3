<meta name="summary" content="Not very Elektrafying"></head><body><p>O.K....so the movie starts off pretty good, but about 30-40 minutes into it, Elektra takes a wrong turn and becomes some sort of teenage girl super hero fantasy.<br /><br />Elektra (Jennifer Garner) was killed in the movie "Daredevil", but apparently was brought back to life by some kind of Zen master using a mystical force called "Kimagure", which allows her to see in the future for a limited amount of time. She works as an assassin, going from one mission to another.<br /><br />She is sent to a lake house to kill father/daughter Mark (Goran Visnjic) and Abby (Kirsten Prout) Miller. Not knowing they are her victims at first, the young Abby begins to bond with Elektra. After a Christmas dinner against her will with both father and daughter, Elektra begins to come out of her shell. She learns that Mark is a widower, and that his wife was previously killed by a drunk driver. Of course she relates to Abby, after losing her mother at an early age also.<br /><br />Afterwards, Elektra finds out that Mark and Abby are her next assignment, and that a group of highly skilled and mystical vigilantes called "The Order of the Hand" are the ones who put the hit on the Millers. Elektra tries to kill the Millers, but alas, she just can't seem to do it.<br /><br />So she does the next best thing: she joins forces with them and decides to fight against the "Hand", whose members all have special abilities of there own (which for the most part are pretty cool)<br /><br />Along the way "Elektra" realizes that the Millers' aren't exactly who they claim to be. This reviewer won't disclose who the Millers' are but will say that once they are revealed, that is when the movie "Elektra" really becomes some sort of Spy Kids/Wonder Woman/Wonder Girl kind of soap opera.<br /><br />All in all Elektra isn't a horrible movie; it's just not a great one either. It suffers from some pretty long stretches throughout. It also fluctuates on being a film made for adults and then for kids; but never really finds it's footing with either audience. Essentially, the film ends up feeling as though it was made for teenage girls.<br /><br />Having never read the Elektra comic book character, I am not sure how closely the comic interpretation of Elektra matches the film. The one thing I am positive of is that Jennifer Garner looks better than ever in the red costume she wears, and she can definitely hold a film together; especially when there's not much of anything else to grab on to.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The most boring war/military movie I've ever seen"></head><body><p>Jarhead follows Jake Gyllenhall through marine bootcamp, through training as a sniper and being sent to Kuwait in the first Gulf War. We watch him get chewed out, worry about his girlfriend cheating on him, fight and party with his marine brothers, go crazy with boredom in the desert and finally get to go on a mission.<br /><br />If all that sounds boring, it is. Nothing interesting happens in this movie. It's 70 minutes into it before the war even begins and then, still nothing happens. Even when he finally gets a mission, it's dull. The scope of this movie tries to be a Full Metal Jacket for the Gulf War generation but fails in the sheer pointlessness of the story.</p></body></html>

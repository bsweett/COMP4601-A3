He escapes from the authorities and instead of fleeing and hiding he sets out to prove his innocence and find the people responsible for his wife's death.  He knows that a one armed man was involved and killed his wife; the only problem is how to find him.<br /><br />Everyone thinks Kimble is guilty and all the evidence points to him trying to collect on insurance money. He escapes when other prisoners try to escape.  He has no choice as he is convicted to death row.  Something is strange about Kimble as when he is escaping he saves the life of one of the guards of the prison bus.  True criminals don't behave that way.<br /><br />US Marshalls are called in to capture the escaped prisoners and Marshall Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) is the head man in the effort to find Kimble....<br /><br />This is an outstanding movie featuring and all-star cast.  This remake of a television series was a smash hit and it is really worth the time and effort to get a copy and watch.  Tommy Lee Jones and Harrison Ford just make this movie something special.  I really enjoyed the movie and I recommend it to you.  It features a great script, excellent actors and the movie is well directed.  You can't ask for a more suspenseful movie that is very entertaining.</p></body></html>

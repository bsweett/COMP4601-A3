<meta name="summary" content="Jason, when he was scary"></head><body><p>I have always been a fan of Part 3 aka 3D! Jason is still just a man, not some zombie killing machine. Being that the early films are still somewhat grounded in reality, it made it all the more frightening to me as a child. Jason also has that scary retarded face, too. That really scared the bejesus out of me when I was a wee thing watching this late at night with my granparents! Kudos the awesome disco/electronica theme song! Jason cuts through the teen campers, drug addicts, and even a biker gang heade by a chick who looks like a young Phylicia Rashad! One guy gets his head crsuhed til his eyeballs pop out while another girls gets skewered by a hot poker iron. Fun for a Saturday late night  viewing!</p></body></html>

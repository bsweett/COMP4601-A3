<meta name="summary" content="An Average Comedy"></head><body><p>Wedding Crashers is a comedy that is arguably the biggest hit of it's kind this year. I'm sure there are some better films available out there but this is the kind that gets all the media's attention. Comedy is a genre that lacks depth. Mixing Will Ferrel towards the end of the film was a clever move. Although his short appearance doesnt make you go bonkers with laughter, it was mildly amusing. Wedding Crashers has some great humor and Owne Wilson's stand out performance astonished me. For some reason, this is the best Comedy performance he has given.<br /><br />Do not even look for any "real" chemistry between Rachel McAdams(Goodness,she's beautiful) and Owen Wilson's character. The grandmother in the film plays a funny role in being honest. I thought they overdid the slot of the teenage gay artist. Vince Vaughn gives a role worth being acknowledged. It's his fast, unbrash, unabrasive yet loud side that made the crowd roar.<br /><br />Although there is nothing in this film that I disliked, Wedding Crashers is at best, one of the finer three star grade movies you will see. It is definitely funnier than Meet The Fockers which was rather sleep inducing. I wish directors could make more films that are more character oriented and a specific theme to it.<br /><br />2005 had many comedies,most of which fall flat on it's face. Check out "Waiting" to see the best comedy of the year with just the right edge of direction,acting and casting. Below 16 stay out(like you'll listen :P )<br /><br />Cheers</p></body></html>

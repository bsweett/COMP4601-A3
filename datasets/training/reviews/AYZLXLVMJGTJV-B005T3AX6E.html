This film has really great characters who just come across with dialog that doesnt so much ring with wit but with imagination. The film uses actors who just turn their roles into scene stealers again and again. It is about gangsters who work for the big boss Maurice. Maurice doesnt show up too much except for a cat and mouse run that turns into a trial of shame and pain for this heavyweight criminal. Willis doesnt say  too much, but he reflects his nonverbal as stoic until he turns into a baby talker with his uniquely attractive french girlfriend with a very round apple face. The two main thugs are Fishburne and Travolta, they both do a good job. I like the way Fishburne uses his speech and articulates so eloquently, he finally feels his bible verse during a murder raid, which will change his life. He decides to become a savior to another mixed up couple during a coffee shop burgler gone wrong. Travolta and Thurman are the most inventive and I loved when they share an intimate outing with drugs overtaking the real connection. They do the twist at a rock a billy diner with the old caddy cars as booths for the lucky few. Keitel plays an organized yuppie sweeper almost seen as godlike by his fame of handling dirty jobs so perfectly. He has a short take but its another creme de le creme character. The things I liked were the cool connection of the Travolta and Thurman, the twist and the fun of showing off their style. I liked Thurmans camera director meeting with him. She displays this air of creativity and in the moment fun even though on a high. Filming is fun, I liked to do little short character takes or shooting your friends like an interview. It was different. I liked the coffee shop. I liked the motel with the anonimity and intimacy they shared, with the overcast skies. I liked the thought of a big breakfast with blueberry pancakes and sausages with lots of maple syrup. I liked that they could go anywhere and experience great adventures like Bora Bora. I liked that Willis went back to help the oppressor out of so much degradation. I liked the way Fishburne wanted to walk the planet, meeting others sharing moments and being open to life. A must see flick.</p></body></html>

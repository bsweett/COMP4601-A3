<meta name="summary" content="The Dark Side of  "Our Miss Brooks""></head><body><p>I don't know why this movie didn't make more of a splash in the theaters. It's a very good psychological thriller with some superb acting.<br /><br />As an alter-ego or imaginary "friend," William Hurt beams his counsel, like dangerous moonlight, over the shoulder, into the ear of Kevin Costner. He is the undermining Iago of this drama. But at the same time, his whispered warnings are amazingly astute, always right on target. Except for the fact that he often urges giving vent to homicidal impulses, that he plies Costner with justifications and permissions to proceed into psychopathology - he might be the ideal imaginary playmate carried over into adulthood. He would be the sort of conjured companion we'd all like to have.<br /><br />Danielle Panabaker is similarly brilliant as Costner's daughter. The exchanges of subtle, knowing looks between Costner and Hurt, between Costner and his daughter, make for chilling preludes, almost more frightening than the actual murders. This movie might in fact be all prelude, because in the DVD commentary, it's mentioned that some of the actors were specifically chosen based on their likely availability for a sequel.<br /><br />As absorbing as this movie is though, it does suffer from some serious lapses in logic. For one thing, it is strongly suggested that Costner comes by his nearly uncontrollable urge to commit murder - as a result of genetics. Well, that sort of theory of specific inheritance went out a long time ago. A number of otherwise good movies made in the 30s now look laughable and dated because their tragic drama revolved around the tendency to inherit "madness." Leading ladies were consigned to spinsterhood more than once because there was insanity in their families. Most doctors would now dismiss such determinism as an absurdity. However the producer and director of this movie still maintain this kind of inheritance as a definite possibility.<br /><br />Then it doesn't seem likely that a serial killer could, in reality, lead such a compartmentalized life - a sincerely loving soccer-Dad by day - an orgiastic killer by night. It's true that many serial killers might appear to the outside world to be normal, devoted husbands and fathers. But somehow, their wives must almost always suspect, their wives who are privy to the sorts of pornography their husbands revel in, the sorts of midnight indulgences they solicit. Mr. Brooks so successfully becomes another person in his workaday life though, that his wife, well-played by Marg Helgenberger, could have no inkling. I don't think so.<br /><br />But who knows? For all the CSI serial killers that we've been awash in over recent years, there are still precious few episodes that truly illuminate the motives of a serial killer, that truly put us in the mind, in the shoes of a serial killer. Mr. Brooks takes a good stab at doing just that - eerily, evilly, imaginatively.</p></body></html>

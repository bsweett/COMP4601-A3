<meta name="summary" content="Great directorial debut for Rob Zombie"></head><body><p>I was really taken off-guard by this energetic and original movie!<br /><br />When we "meet the meat," as Lyz Kingsley would say, the two guys actually have personalities and become characters with at least some depth.  As per usual, the girls get shortchanged in this category.  And then we meet the crazy Spaulding family.  Even though they're psychos, each of them gets at least some degree of personality and character as well.  As a result, "House of 1000 Corpses" is much more interesting than the run-of-the-mill horror film.  You may think you know where this movie is going once you're 30 minutes into it, but trust me, you don't, and I'm not going to ruin the ending for you.<br /><br />There are some funny, funny moments in the movie, which come directly out of the characters.  Refreshingly, the horror and the comedy don't get mixed.  Zombie pulls no punches in the horror department, and doesn't cheat by cutting away in the conventional places.  The Spauldings don't issue cheap one-liners after some mayhem.  The juxtaposition of short moments of horror between other scenes having different tones keeps you off balance and makes the horror more effective.<br /><br />As for the DVD itself, it is loaded with special features, and has the funniest menus you will ever see.  Each menu features a different character talking to (or berating) you, the viewer.  When you first insert the disc, Captain Spaulding will abuse you for minutes on end.  And it's funny!  You'll wait 10 minutes before you press play just to listen to him.<br /><br />This disc is worth at least a rent.  Now I can't wait to see "The Devil's Rejects"!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bruce Willis Tour de Force"></head><body><p>Bruce Willis first big screen staring role was quite a jolt to fans considering its very different tone from his star making vehicle, the TV series "Moonlighting".<br /><br />In Moonlighting, Willis was perfect romantic comedy material, but his ability to perform deeds of heroism was very much in doubt.<br /><br />The cocky attitude came thru from the TV role, but added to it was a capacity to direct action and violence that was entirely lacking his previous performance.<br /><br />Often actors take a while to find the vehicle that best defines their movie career. Willis was lucky (or unlucky) to hit the mark on his very first try. Although he has branched into other types of roles in the decades since Die Hard, his subsequent roles are always measured against this one.<br /><br />The movie itself is an action delight. It was very unique when made, but spawned the myriad "heros who never give up and defy all pain and obstacles" movies that have been made since. It has been copied so many times and by so many major stars that the list is too long to even begin.<br /><br />Die Hard also gave us the most profane "best remembered line" in the history of movies.

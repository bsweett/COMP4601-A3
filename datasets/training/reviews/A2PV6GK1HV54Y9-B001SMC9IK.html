The reviews for this film were pretty harsh and of course everyone is comparing this one to the original so it's hard to give an accurate criticism. I am not a fan of Jaden Smith, that kid just ruined this movie for me. Connelly is the only actor worth watching, her performance is honest and intriguing. The special effects are cool but the writing is somewhat contrived. It's a mixed bag for me.</p></body></html>

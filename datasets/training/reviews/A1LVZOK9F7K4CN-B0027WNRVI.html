Perhaps the reason I liked this movie is that my expectations were so low - I'd been hearing negative feedback for weeks.  But what sold me is this movie is a love letter to Classic Age of Universal Monster Movies.  The plot of this film is no more silly than that of Frankenstein vs. the Wolf Man, say.  <p>Frankly, I think Sommers has ONLY seen those movies - everything in this film is reminiscent of them: Frankenstein in the windmill, Dracula's Bela Lugosi accent.  The main character is named Gabriel Van Helsing - either to distinguish him from Bram Stoker's Abraham Van Helsing, or Sommers just didn't know what his first name really was.  In actuality, this is an "alternate universe" story - the Frankenstein and Dracula have nothing to do with Mary Shelley or Bram Stoker...or history, for that matter.<p>This is essentially a James Bond film.  Van Helsing works for the Catholic Secret Service, going around the world, killing monsters.  The funny thing is, Hugh Jackman is basically playing Wolverine from X-Men all over again: he is an immortal super-hero who can't remember his past.  Sound familiar?  Watch the movie, the comparisons grow.<p>I enjoyed this movie for the art direction and the atmosphere.  Let's face it, no matter how many times filmmakers want to take us inside Castle Dracula, I'll be there to go with them.  The story is pure shlock, but that doesn't matter.  The whole film seems to be a promo for the Van Helsing Ride coming to a Universal Theme Park near you!  However, I mind mindless action movies less lately.  Screenplay writing is a dead art and if I'm going to sit through a banal script, I better be watching something visually interesting.</p></body></html>

Much-awaited, action-packed "Live Free or Die Hard" (also known as "Die Hard 4.0") lives up to our expectation with non-stop action sequences and snappy dialogues. But the most impressive is of course Bruce Willis and his character, NYPD detective John McClane, whose latest job "to just pick up a kid in New Jersey and drive him down to D.C." turns out a much more difficult one than he thinks.<br /><br />The film's nice idea is to pit a veteran NYPD cop against a group of cyber terrorists. Maybe I should not reveal too much here, but the fourth "Die Hard" film has something to do with the worst scenario of cyber terrorism in USA. If one man can stop that, it must be McClane, whose job is to save the good and kill the bad. The tough cop has to survive the attacks not only from a helicopter but from a military jet fighter and high-kicking kung-fu fighter. This sounds like a bad joke, but it really works.<br /><br />In fact, I was pleasantly surprised to see the great action sequences by director Len Wiseman, who avoids his MTV-like, heavily stylistic photography he used for "Underworld," but he instead shows more orthodox action storytelling that reminds us of John McTiernan who helmed the first and third "Die Hard" films. Moreover, those actins come with a healthy dose of humor, the same kind that made his character very popular and likable in the previous films.<br /><br />Bruce Willis may not be the most skillful or versatile actor in Hollywood, but he surely has charisma, and his commanding presence as John McClane, a nice, tough guy,  makes up for the numerous plot holes and preposterous episodes. Also impressive is the supporting cast, which includes Justin Long, Timothy Oliphant, Cliff Curtis, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Maggie Q, who is much better than in "MI3" with her martial arts skills. Kevin Smith appears as "Warlock" with several amusing references to "Star Wars."<br /><br />In short John McClane comes back. Slick and fast-paced "Live Free or Die Hard" is a thrilling and exciting action film, great 130 minute roller coaster ride.</p></body></html>

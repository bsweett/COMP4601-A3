<meta name="summary" content="Realistic dystopian vision, but lacks focus"></head><body><p>At first, this film seemed to be a sci-fi film noire in the mold of Blade Runner. It portrays a dystopian society in which women lack fertility. Indeed, unlike a lot of sci-fi films nowadays, "Children of Men" does not shy away from making dystopia realistic and grisly. Key characters are killed suddenly, the color palate is mainly grey, and all of the key characters have traits that make them less than admirable. In one chilling scene, an important character is last shown being taken away by troops with a hood over her head, which is the last we see of her.<br /><br />The film could have really been a sci-fi hit had it not been so pointless. It lacks focus and the plot never really grabs the viewer's interest. A lot of important relationships and plot twists are left unexplained. We never learn why women become infertile or why immigrants are treated so badly, except perhaps that this is a dystopia. Unlike Blade Runner, the movie had no insightful moment or moral revelation. Rather than provoking thought, the film's end seems too hollywood for the genre.<br /><br />I like the style of dystopia, the basic idea by P.D. James, and the cinematography, but the plot (which should be the heart of the film) is just not strong enough. I found myself bored during the film and frankly not caring about the characters or the outcome. I would give the director another shot at a sci-fi dystopia, but with a tighter story-line.</p></body></html>

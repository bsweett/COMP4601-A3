<meta name="summary" content="What was Dame Judi thinking???"></head><body><p>I bought The Chronicles of Riddick on DVD for my brother for Christmas, but due to a mix-up he already had it, and I never achieved a chance to return it upon my return from Canada. So, I finally pulled it out and watched it yesterday evening. Here are my thoughts.<br /><br />Dame Judi: You're an Oscar-winner, your talents were wasted here.<br /><br />Vin Diesel: Perhaps you should have insisted on a more thoughtful plot? The plot in this movie tried to portray itself as clever, but with exchanges like "How did you know that's what they did?" "Because that was my plan." you can't expect me to take the plot seriously, can you? Vin, it's a space opera, they're all about timing, and this movie had none, and tried to cover it up with "cleverness". Next time, check out Star Trek II for timing lessons and a more appropriate mix of action, contemplation, big ideas, and personal sacrifice.<br /><br />Thandie Newton: Finally, I am convinced that you can act. Well, your tongue can, at least, in a non-speaking role.<br /><br />Karl Urban: My comment is similar to that for Judi. After The Lord of the Rings, I expected better, at least in terms of movie selections.<br /><br />Nice special effects were wasted on a poorly scripted and directed movie about a man who brings down a galactic jihad. This DVD is going out for resale.</p></body></html>

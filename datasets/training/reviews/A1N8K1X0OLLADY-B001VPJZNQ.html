<meta name="summary" content="The lovely Rosario Dawson is the only highlight"></head><body><p>Rosario Dawson, who was the hot chick in Men in Black 2, is a co-star in The Rundown. She is the only reason why you should see this movie. Everybody else sucked.<br /><br />The action scenes are very watered-down. And Rock's fight scenes looked as fake as wrestling.<br /><br />This is a nice rental since it's better than the Scorpion King, but it is not worth buying to own.</p></body></html>

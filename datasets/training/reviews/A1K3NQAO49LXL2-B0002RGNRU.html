<meta name="summary" content="Life is about your relationship with your inner demons"></head><body><p>A strange movie about memory. Jim Carry is an unlovable schmuck, but for some reason he meets this wacky, gorgeous girl who's also quite horny. Slowly we get to see him interact with this girl, slowly we realize that there's much more behind their relationship. Why? Because it's a film from a Charlie Kaufmann script, where anything can happen. The couple has tender, happy moments that are very memorable (or memory-like) in an iconic kind of way. These are devices we refer back to, they make the movie feel like it is warm, comfortable, and we root for the heroes who struggle against what they are doing to themselves. Do they know that they were destined to be together? Things get weird - once we figure out what is going on, we get some back story. And then that back story gets back story. And then that back story also gets back story. And then the back story becomes the only story that there ever was. Because it's destiny. Complaints? None, really, although Kirstin Dunst acting horny is a bit awkward - she doesn't do horny well. Elijah Wood is good and creepy. And Jim Carrey - well, he can act... like a dork. I sometimes wonder how many people out there have so much time for resolving their inner demons that they don't really need to do regular things like work, cook, watch TV...</p></body></html>

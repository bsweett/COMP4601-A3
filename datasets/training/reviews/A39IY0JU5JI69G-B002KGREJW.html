It's supposed to be an Indie film, though, and won raves at Sundance.  This surprised me; I would have expected it to have been made at Disney.  The story is nothing special although there are some genuinely funny moments.<br /><br />What saves it and earns my four stars here is the excellent cast.  Greg Kinnear is always terrific, in my book.  Alan Arkin gives the performance only an old master can do.  Abigail Breslin is truly Little Miss Sunshine;it's great to see a child's performance that isn't overly adorable.  Steve Carrell is very good in what had to be a difficult role, rising from his suicidal despair to life before our eyes. Paul Dano is good too as the suffering teenager.  I am not a big fan of Toni Collette.  Somehow she is too good at playing disagreeable, to make me warm up to her character.  But she does sweeten up a bit in the end.<br /><br />As other reviewers have mentioned there are some things that are too improbable for us to take the film seriously, such as the fact that no one but grandpa has bothered to see the child's act.  I think that what bothered me the most was the stereotyped way of presenting most of the characters. We are clearly shown who the good guys and the bad guys are, in the eyes of the writers, and personally I find that annoying.  We're supposed to love the long suffering mom but I found her to be a dismal crank who has nothing but ridicule for her husband.  We're supposed to hate the dad but he is the one who by sheer force of will, pulls the family through all of the set-backs.<br /><br />More cliches:  the stupid cop, the superficial folks at the beauty pagent, the cold hearted "bereavement counselor" etc.  Yeah, there's some truth in all of that, I suppose, but it detracts from the overall value of the film for me.  If this were just a screwball farce, then fine, but we are asked to take it seriously and the heavy handedness of the writers in telling us who we're supposed to cheer and who to boo, leaves me a bit disgusted.  However, that's Hollywood, and as I said above, if you don't take it too seriously, it's an entertaining two hours.<br /><br />I have not seen the alternative endings but if I were to make one, it would feature Dad dumping Mom as soon as they get back to Albuquerque.<br /> :-)</p></body></html>

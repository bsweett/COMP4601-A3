<meta name="summary" content="A Haunting Documentary About a Man Who Lived Amongst Bears and Died a Grisly Death"></head><body><p>Grizzly Man is Werner Herzog's 2005 documentary about Timothy Treadwell, a man who spent 13 summers in a National Preserve in Alaska living amongst grizzly bears. At the end of his 13th summer in 2003, Timothy and his girlfriend were killed by a bear. Whether you like Treadwell or not, Herzog has crafted a fascinating documentary about the man who filmed his exploits over the course of his thirteen summers at the preserve. Herzog blends over 100 hours of Treadwell's footage in with interviews of people who knew him or knew of him. This is a Herzog film, so some of these people (notably the coroner) stand out as being a little quirky but you might not notice then when seeing footage of Treadwell.<br /><br />Clearly Treadwell's passion and disregard for the dangers involved are what attracted Herzog to this project, as Herzog is known to be a very passionate man who disregards things that stand in his way. Through this footage and interviews with his close friends, we can deduce that Treadwell was a troubled man-child, slightly delusional but very passionate about the bears that he lived amongst. Deep down he was a good person, but a flawed one. When not at the preserve, Treadwell would tour schools and (free of charge) share his interaction with grizzly bears with schoolchildren. My own personal opinion of Treadwell is one of mixed feelings. It's hard to defend the sanity of someone who gets excited over bear excrement, but I admire his dedication (no matter how flawed it was) and in a way I find him an inspiring figure. Treadwell, in his footage, speaks frequently of death and how living amongst grizzly bears could lead to him dying but he seems okay with that. Although not on the DVD edition, but in the film at one point, Treadwell was interviewed by David Letterman who asked him if we would go on to read an article about how he'd been eaten by bears, a question he took with denial and good-humor. Love him or hate him, Treadwell died doing something he loved and was passionate about. How many people can you say that about? Unfortunately, Treadwell's girlfriend also perished in this mishap and, while this film does little to enlighten us about her story, she seemed more passionate about Timothy's passion than she did about bears making her seem even more tragic.<br /><br />The film is narrated by Herzog is his wonderful German-accented dialect and emotionless delivery. Herzog has never been a conventional filmmaker and while his narration serves to inform us of the background of several scenes, he also uses it to give us his own perception of Treadwell. What no one can deny no matter what their thoughts are on Treadwell and his cause is that the man obtained some beautiful, ethereal footage. As Herzog puts it (and I'm paraphrasing) `No studio director could hope to capture images as beautiful as Timothy did.' Scenes such as a fox trotting up to Timothy unannounced in the middle of his monologue and a scene of two bears fighting achieve a very rough, real beauty that you can't find in even the most stylized, high-budgeted nature documentary.<br /><br />Herzog's Grizzly Man is a great achievement in documentary filmmaking and one of the most accessible documentaries I've seen. Herzog takes Treadwell's footage and makes something exquisite out of it that I doubt Treadwell ever envisioned possible. While Treadwell reached a tragic and (no pun intended) grisly end, Grizzly Man is a very humorous documentary that treats its subject with both skepticism and respect. It's ultimately a haunting film and many images will likely remain with you. In the last bit of footage shot mere hours before his death, Herzog helpfully points out that Treadwell "seems hesitant to leave the frame of his own film" and watching the scene, I saw no reason to argue with him. Anyone expecting to see a video of Treadwell's death will be disappointed, as only audio exists and Herzog declines to use it in the film. While people are naturally fascinated by the morbid, we are told what happens on the tape so many times that Herzog's reaction to listening to it on-screen is effective enough to get the point across. While people may question the authenticity of the interview segments due to the strange, eccentricities of the people interviewed, my simple response would be: That's a Herzog film for you. Overall, it's a documentary that's not to be missed as it's a poignant, haunting, funny, and depressing film about a delightfully weird man who did what he loved to do and whether or not he was wrong or right to do so, he's a fascinating person that deserved this great documentary about him.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Lycanthropy"></head><body><p>Lycanthropy is 'in folklore, the magical ability to assume the form and characteristics of a wolf: it also describes a delusion that one has become or assumed the characteristics of a wolf or other animal'.  What makes this remake of the original screenplay circa 1941 by Curt Siodmak is the apparent respect for the 'delusional' aspect of the subject matter.  The setting for the film is Blackmoor England 1891 and the screen is filled with imagery so dark and dependent on candlelight that the underlying terror of the story is well set.  The story is known to everyone: Sir John Talbot (Sir Anthony Hopkins in a mesmerizingly  dissociative role) has a past that includes the loss of his wife by 'suicide' and the loss of his one son Lawrence (Benecio Del Toro, miscast here) to the land of America where he became an actor, never communicating with his family - the family now being solely his father and his brother Ben (Simon Merrels) along with Ben's affianced Gwen (Emily Blunt).  While Lawrence is playing 'Hamlet' in London, Gwen comes to Lawrence's dressing room to seek his help in investigating the recent murder of Ben.  Lawrence acquiesces and returns to the Blackmoor manor, much to the surprise of his strange father. As Lawrence  begins his search he is attacked by a werewolf and thus, by definition, he becomes cursed and is destined to live out his days as an occult monster who breaks into the werewolf mode at the full moon.  The story from there needs to be viewed instead of reviewed as what little story there is lies in the conclusion of this strange family.<br /><br />The cast is strong - Hopkins is his usual master of acting, Blunt manages to create a credible character with the little material given her, Hugo Weaving turns in probably the best performance as an Inspector with insight about lycanthropy, and even Geraldine Chaplin glows a bit as the gypsy Maleva.  The cinematography by Shelly Johnson captures all the gory details of carnivorism and the stench of an insane asylum and Danny Elfman's musical score enhances the moods.  THE WOLFMAN is not a great movie, but it is a good period piece and a reminder of the original film that started the now overabundance of film on werewolves and vampires.

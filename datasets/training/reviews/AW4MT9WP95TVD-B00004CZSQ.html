The plot is laughably lifted from many other films and held together by, well, nothing. It's no wonder Jessica Harper has disappeared. And Joan Bennet's performance makes her turn on Dark Shadows look award-worthy. Really!<p>Visually, it's wild to look at ... kind of like a whorehouse in Querelle or a Ken Russell daydream. Otherwise it does not have much going for it. The soundtrack is effectively creepy - but if you have a home theater system, be warned: it is LOUD. <p>And scary ... Not At All. The only frightening thing is the bizarre adoration some people have for this movie.<p>Artsy for those who haven't seen any real art films.</p></body></html>

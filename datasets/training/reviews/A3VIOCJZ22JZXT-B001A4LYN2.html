<meta name="summary" content="Dark visions of American capitalism and evangelism"></head><body><p>This is an exceptional film that explores America's unique obsessions with driving ambitious industry and evangelical religion. Loosely based on Upton Sinclair's 1927 novel, Oil, the film is a stand alone excellent product that is independent of the novel. The complex subject matter can be explored because of the film's narrative structure that is chronological and straight forward story telling as well as the exceptional acting demonstrated by all the main characters. The film may be interpreted as fascinating character study and it may also be interpreted as an exploration of the darker side of capitalism encountering the darker side of evangelism.<br /><br />The film begins in 1898 with scenes of Daniel Plainview, a silver miner, discovering silver and simultaneously breaking his leg through a nasty fall down a mine shaft. We see this man literally crawl to stake his claim before he discovers oil in his second attempt at exploration. Gradually this man hires a crew and begins a series of discoveries of oil until in 1902 an accident kills a driller and Daniel informally adopts the orphaned child HW as his son. In 1911 Plainview and his business associate are approached by a California sheep herder, Paul Sunday, who reveals for a small payment where oil can be found on his family farm. Daniel and his adopted son act like hunters and visit the Sunday farm and find the claims are true. From this point a struggle begins between Daniel Plainview and Eli Sunday, the charismatic evangelical preaching son in the Sunday family. This tension builds as the Sunday family is pushed into the sidelines as Plainview's wealth and dominance builds. Multiple dramatic episodes unfold as a derrick explosion and fire leave young HW deaf. A long lost younger brother of Daniel appears only to eventually be revealed to be less than he promises. Eli Sunday establishes the Church of the Third Revelation and becomes a force that Daniel must compromise with to maintain control of property rights and workers.<br /><br />As character study, the film is exceptional. We see Daniel as a man of amazing drive and determination. He is ambitious and crafty. These characteristics lead to outstanding industry and internal corruption. He moves from a speculator who strategizes to get oil out of the ground to a man obsessed with control of the land rights of the oil fields and the maneuvers needed to outwit his competition and maintain power.  He cares for the orphan HW but his parenting skills and priorities are out of order. HW is rendered deaf in a derrick explosion and eventually Daniel is able to get him into a school for the deaf where he learns sign language allowing him to communicate. Daniel also opens up when he thinks his long lost younger brother, Henry, joins him and wishes to work in the oil field. In conversation with Henry we hear Daniel's philosophy with such comments as: "I have a competition in me. I want no one else to succeed."  He also states: "I hate most people." Later he says: "I look at people and I see nothing worth liking."  Prophetically he says:"I want to make enough money to get away from everyone."  It is with Eli Sunday that we see revealed the most amazing sides of Daniel's personality. Daniel relishes in humiliating the evangelist and his family until through the Church of the Third Revelation, Eli gains power over the local landowners and Daniel must become `saved' and part of the congregation to gain access to their land-rights. Daniel must undergo the trial of acting like his soul has been saved by Jesus so as to gain financial advantage. This humiliation further buries his soul under his unresolved inner demons and pain, twisting him further from human experience and compassion. Daniel Day-Lewis plays this role with attention to every small detail of expression which paints a frightening portrait of fierce heartless greed and lust for power driven by some inner absence of recognition of his fellowman's dignity.<br /><br />The character of Eli Sunday, played by Paul Dano, is only a bit less complex.  This young man gains power through evangelical fundamentalism and after several years of humiliation and beating from Daniel, seeks his revenge is forcing Daniel to become saved by Jesus to gain property rights. But Eli knows that Daniel is not really saved, for Eli also is prideful and uses his church as a theater to degrade and belittle Daniel when he knows Daniel is desperate for the land rights to take his oil to the Pacific Ocean.<br /><br />In addition to an astute character study, the film is also a study in American capitalism and American evangelism. We see the dark under belly of both and we see the results when the two forces clash. This is a thoughtful and exceptional film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Movie Worth Watching Over and Over"></head><body><p>"The Queen" (2006) is a wonderful, fascinating movie with a great script, superior cinematography, and great acting by Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II and by Michael Sheen as a toothy Tony Blair. It's all about the death of Prince Diana, the royals' reaction and behavior after her death and the way the public in an outpouring of grief turned their wrath against the royal family believing them to be indifferent to her death.<br />Looking back, the paroxysms of grief that were displayed by the public now seem excessive. Viewing the movie now, I think viewers may be slightly more sympathetic toward the Queen.<br />The movie portrays the royal family with Prince Philip, Elizabeth's husband (expertly played by actor James Cromwell) as a mean-spirited and nasty man who always has to put his oar in. The Queen Mum (in a brilliant piece of casting played by Sylvia Syms) is cold-hearted. Prince Charles is ineffectual, weak, and bungling. The Queen shows her disdain for him and has some nasty cracks to make about her playgirl sister Margaret.<br />All of this, of course, involves guesswork and supposition by the screenwriter since few were privy to what went on in the royal establishment. When Diana died, the royals were ensconced in Balmoral Castle in Scotland. Callous Prince Philip took the boys (Prince William and Hall, not portrayed in the movie) out hunting for a stag during the mourning period.<br />The Queen and royals remained in Balmoral while the public seethed. The movie shows the newly elected Blair benefiting from the furor and shows him imploring the Queen to show some consideration for her subjects who wanted her to be almost mourner-in-chief. Finally Blair convinces the Queen that the media is after her head, and the public is turning against the monarchy.<br />Through all of this Helen Mirren does a masterful job of making the Queen a flawed but real and human person.<br />Newsreel footage is used with great skill. It's an engrossing look at the royals. Elizabeth drives herself around the huge Balmoral estate, and she sees a beautiful stag. The symbolism of the stag is not completely clear, whether it shows Elizabeth's reaction to her predicament, whether it's Diana, or whether it shows that she values animals above human beings.</p></body></html>

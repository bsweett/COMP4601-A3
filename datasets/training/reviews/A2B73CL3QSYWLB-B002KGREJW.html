The Hoovers are flawed individuals yet somehow cohere as a loving family unit.  "Little Miss Sunshine" is a celebration of the differences that exist in pretty much all families but are afraid to admit it.  The film also succeeds as an indictment of the beauty pageant mentality that perpetuates the Jonbenet Ramsey syndrome that unfortunately exists in our society.  No film has skewered the beauty pageant culture so expertly since Michael Ritchie's "Smile" in 1975.  The cast is uniformly excellent but special citations should go to Alan Arkin and Abigail Breslin.  Arkin, whose star rose in the sixties but has kind of waned in recent years, gives a cliche free performance as the drugtaking grandpa.  Breslin, as Olive, has the formidable chore of being the optimistic glue that holds the Hoover clan together.  The tender scene between Arkin and Breslin prior to the pageant is heart-rending.  I cite Arkin and Breslin only because that of the cast members they should not be forgotten come Oscar time.  For that matter the film shouldn't be forgotten by the Academy members either.</p></body></html>

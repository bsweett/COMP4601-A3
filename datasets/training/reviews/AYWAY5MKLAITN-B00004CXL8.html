There's only one thing that stands in his way of being a nice guy: Himself. He's an obessive-compulsive, superstitious, dog-hating, wise-talking, mean-spirited, germaphobic, angry, cranky, vindictive, clean freak, taunter, politcally incorrect, psycho, nut, ego maniac who just can't get over himself. He eats at the same resturant every day where his favorite waitress will come and put up with him. There is also is neigbhor who gets mocked and made fun of by melvin almost everyday. Until the day when his neighbhor gets beaten up and his waitress is at home taking care of her sick boy. Now he's got nobody to make fun of and no one that'll take his crap. His whole glorious world of being miserable is falling apart.<br /><br />Not only does he have to help his neighbor but he also has to hire a doctor to get the waitress's boy fixed up. And all the while trying to be mean about it which is, of course, impossible. Or so we think. After all . . .it's Melvin . . .a guy that locks his doors five times and that will wash his hands with scolding hot water and twenty bars of soap.<br /><br />Now, he's out to make things right . . .or at least make it halfway there. The waitress, played by helen hunt, is extremely grateful but extremly confused by melvin. Could there be love in store for melvin?<br /><br />Filled with heartwarming moments, funny snappy dialogue, comedic moments, and good old jack nicholson atittude.<br /><br />This is one story that answers the all time question:<br /><br />"What if this is as good as it gets?"<br /><br />Well, as a movie buff, I sure hope so.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I had a family once"></head><body><p>I had a life.<br /><br />Now all I have is a mission<br /><br />The year is 2415; it has been seven generations since the industrial plague whipped out 99% of the people. The few remaining survivors are all huddled into one city with walls protecting them from what ever is outside. It is an ideal city of Bregna ran by Trevor Goodchild (Marton Csokas) and a council. And as with any such city there will always be rebels that thinks something is wrong with lack of freedom and mysterious disappearances. Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) belongs to such an organization. Her mission as the most ept agent is to dispatch the so called benevolent ruler. Can she do this or will circumstances and chance encounters change the situation?<br /><br />The film does not boast of any thing really extraordinary except maybe an exceptionally rich architectural back drop. Shot mostly in Berlin we see many popular places that for some reason they though would not be that familiar to the audience. Evidently they must not know how popular Berlin is, especially key locations. The original location on their wish list was Brasilia because of its 1050's futuristic look; however that proved to be economically unfeasible. See if you recognize Sans Souci, Potsdam built in 1745 by Frederick the Great, one of the world best know orangeries.<br /><br />Although this movie had nothing extraordinary it is a perfect example of the genre and will hold your attention as you anticipate where they are going with the story. Only someone that anticipates that it will stick to the animated series may be disappointed.<br /><br />The DVD rendering adds some background commentaries that make rewatching the film more enjoyable.</p></body></html>

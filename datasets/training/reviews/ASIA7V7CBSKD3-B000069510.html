<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly Good"></head><body><p>I'm not really a fan of the comic book or video game based movies, however, "Resident Evil" is one thrilling movie.  The story line is well put together and original for the most part (ok, so there are zombies, past that though...)<br /><br />The sequel to "Resident Evil" I think makes this movie even better and you should definately watch both, in order.  While Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodrigues might be type-cast, they certainly deliever when it counts.<br /><br />Those who play and know the video game I'm sure will like the movie even more then the uniniated such as myself, but do not let that stop you from see this surprisingly good movie.</p></body></html>

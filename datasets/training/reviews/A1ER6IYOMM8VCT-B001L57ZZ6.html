<meta name="summary" content="FACED PACED SCI FI THRILLER! 4 1/2 STARS!"></head><body><p>I know, I know! This film is implausible, it could have had a better actor (Shia LaBeouf) in the lead, but growing up loving the sci-fi genre of yesteryear, I had to think about my rating on those terms. In the old days of sci-fi films(50's, 60's and 70's) we didn't always get the best actors or special FX and the plots were certainly a bit of a stretch to say the least. So if you compare this film to some of those old lovable and laughable classics; this film is really quite interesting and very well done. Sure there are many moments where everything works out too conveniently, but it's a sci-fi fantasy and I can forgive that because it's a well executed story with an intriguing plot.<br /><br />I really liked this film and I think those of you who go into this film with the right frame of mind will truly enjoy it despite its minor shortcomings. Of course this film is considered sci-fi now, but who knows if it's not reality in a few years!</p></body></html>

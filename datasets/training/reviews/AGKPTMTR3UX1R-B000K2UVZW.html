A Big Puddle."></head><body><p>Based on the true story of the gruesome murder of Elizabeth Short in 1947, THE BLACK DAHLIA is no homage to the young lady. It isn't even historically accurate.<br /><br />Film noir really should be restricted to black and white. Director Brian DePalma (who has created a very uneven body of work over the years)  knows this, and so he tries to create atmospherics in THE BLACK DAHLIA by switching between B & W and color. It doesn't help.<br /><br />Baby-faced Josh Hartnett, who still looks like he should be doing teen fare, is hideously miscast as a cop in 1940s LA who is trying to unravel the truth behind the gruesome murder-mutilation of the young would-be starlet. Hartnett's role cries out for granite-faced grit and toughness (think Sam Spade) but instead we get Mr. John Q. Sensitivity. Aaron Eckert, who plays his partner, is similarly fresh-faced. Neither of these guys even has stubble on their chins. I doubt they shave, even in real life.<br /><br />Scarlett Johanssen plays their shared girlfriend. Johanssen, who usually gives it her all onscreen, starts out strong, but, realizing this film is a turkey, decides to save her energy for a better day.<br /><br />The best performance of the film belongs to Hilary Swank, who is lush, lustful and convincing, not to mention Ava Gardner gorgeous, in her uninhibited role as a sex kitten. But even the presence of the two-time Oscar winner does not redeem this film which meanders unevenly and oft-times pointlessly through its dim, confused storyline, which includes outre sex, drugs, murder, family scandal, money, multiple betrayals, and not one character worth saving.<br /><br />While all of the above are de riguer for film noir, merely flinging all these elements together in a heap and adding a few fedoras for flavor does not a movie make. Motive is missing, as is real tension, hence the real darkness that makes a film truly noir. Without a clear-cut story, and with just too many subplots, THE BLACK DAHLIA becomes a waste of time. In the end, you just don't give a damn whodunit.</p></body></html>

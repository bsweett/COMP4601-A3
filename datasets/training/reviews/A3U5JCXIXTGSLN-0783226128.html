<meta name="summary" content="The World Is Yours!"></head><body><p>&quot;Scarface&quot; is an incredible film about the rise and fall of a Cuban refugee in Miami, FL in the early 1980s.<p>This film revolves around Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee who came to this country when Fidel Castro expelled many of this citizens (and criminals) to the United States in 1980. Tony and his friends soon discover the world of cocaine and begin selling it. Tony builds an empire out of this business and eventually becomes a very powerful man. However, all of the power soon comes to an end when a hit is placed on him. The climactic scene at the end (containing the now famous line, &quot;say hello to my little friend!&quot; will leave you in awe!<p>Al Pacino gives what I believe is an Oscar-worthy performance as Tony Montana, while the very young Michelle Pfeiffer portrays his cocaine-addicted wife. The film can quite violent at times and very strong language is used often, so you might want to put the kids to bed before watching this one.<p>The second disc containing all of the special features is a gem within itself. It contains deleted scenes, how the film came to fruition, and a short documentary about how &quot;Scarface&quot; has influenced many of the hip-hop artists today.<p>Overall, I would give this film and its special features 10 stars. Even though Tony chose to go into the business of cocaine, it shows how a person coming from virtually nothing can become one of the most power people in the country if his or her drive is strong enough. Like the movie says, &quot;The world is yours!&quot; I would highly recommend this film to anyone with a DVD player. It's a film that I think everyone should see at least once in their lives, whether you're into gangster films or not. You will not be disappointed at all!!! Watch this film!!!!!</p></body></html>

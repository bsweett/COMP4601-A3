All African Americans should watch this film.  Here is the depiction of an African American hero who refuses to give up, even when the odds are hopelessly against him.  All those who are facing major life setbacks should also watch this film.  This film offers more than entertainment.  This film offers encouragement to carry on.  All those who struggle with family relationships should see this film.  This film shows a love between a father and son that weathers the storms of life.  This film encourages family members to hold on a little longer.  Anyone not yet mentioned should see this film.  This film is one of those rare works of art that has the potential to improve society.  Will Smith does an excellent job in his role as Chris Gardner.<br /><br />NEGATIVES:  I only gave this film four stars because it begins to get a little slow about 2/3 of the way through and the conclusion is predictable.  The film's media publicity probably brought a few more people to the film, but gave away too much of the plot.</p></body></html>

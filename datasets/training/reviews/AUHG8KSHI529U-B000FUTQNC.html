<meta name="summary" content="A solid entertainment and Harrison Ford Thriller.  Just don't expect an airtight plot or too much reality."></head><body><p>This is a pretty good Harrison Ford action flick.  He plays Jack Stanfield who is a pretty talented VP of security for a smallish bank that is in the middle of a takeover by a huge bank that is planning on getting, well, huger.  Our hero is none too pleased about the takeover and is vocal about it.  We see over the opening titles that Jack is being watched, but by whom?  The new boss of security in the new parent bank is Gary Mitchell (played very effectively by Robert Patrick).  He comes across that he will stop at nothing to get what he wants.  Is he behind this?  What about the sudden amazingly good offer from entrepreneur Bill Cox (played with the right presence by Paul Bettany)?  Why that offer and why now?  It seems to make sense now that Jack's senior position is going away.  Wouldn't he rather be his own boss rather than a step lower in a bigger machine?<br /><br />The always wonderful Virginia Madsen plays Jack's wife.  She is a talented architect who even designed the house they live in.  The indifferent put upon teenage daughter who hasn't a clue how great a life she has, Sarah, is played to perfection by Carly Schroeder.  Andy is the young son with a peanut allergy and played with the right amount of boyish curiosity and too much friendliness is played by Jimmy Bennet.  They become the lever that is used against Jack, but I won't reveal how or why.  That unfolding is the whole point and pleasure of the movie.<br /><br />As things unfold, I like the way they keep Jack struggling.  He is not a superhero.  He is slow to climb over things and doesn't run so well.  When he jumps down something, he stumbles and knocks over a chair.  When the fighting happens, he is more passionate than skilled.  This is a computer jock after all, not a member of the CIA or the Delta Force.  Heck, he probably has never even taken a martial arts class.<br /><br />Mary Lynn Rajskub is great as Jack's admin, Janet Stone.  She does her best, but gets put upon.  Is she in on the plot or not?  What about the big boss of the bank being bought, Arlin Forester (I really enjoy seeing Alan Arkin as often as I can)?  Is he watching Jack so the merger isn't derailed?  What!?<br /><br />Really, once things get underway, the plot isn't a big mystery.  Nor are the things that happen to Jack and his family things we haven't seen before.  Still, the movie works in its own way, especially if you don't think about it too quickly.  Like most thrillers, you have to suspend your understanding of reality and think sloooowly so you don't get ahead of things.  But it works well as a solid entertainment.</p></body></html>

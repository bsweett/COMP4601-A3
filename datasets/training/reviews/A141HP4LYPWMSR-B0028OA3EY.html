<meta name="summary" content=""The World Doesn't Need A Savior And Neither Do I" ~ Needed Or Not, Superman Returns"></head><body><p>"Look up in the sky! It's a bird, it's a plane, no it's Christopher Ree... I mean it's Brandon Routh!"<br /><br />The '06 release of `Superman Returns' is both a nostalgic tribute to the `70's `Superman' films starring the late Christopher Reeve with its incorporation of composer the John Williams original theme and a promising introduction to a new Superman series of adventures tailor made for the 21st century audience.<br /><br />Director Bryan Singer masterful combination of both old and new elements of the Superman Mythos was a stroke of genius, creating for the "Old School" Superman fan a comforting sense of continuity with the earlier films. I openly admit to experiencing an increased heart rate and a childish sense of wonder and excitement the instant I heard that familiar John Williams' theme as part of the new musical score.<br /><br />Along with incredible special effects `Superman Returns' delivers a great new soundtrack and a strong script. Add to the mix a well chosen new superhero played by Brandon Routh and a top notch performance by Kevin Spacey as the villainous Lex Luther and we've got a new cult classic to enjoy over and over again. Now if I could only find that old cape of mine!</p></body></html>

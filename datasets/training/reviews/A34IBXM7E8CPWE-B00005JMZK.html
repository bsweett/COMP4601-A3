<meta name="summary" content="Should Have Been So Much More!!"></head><body><p>After reading several other reviews that state how much footage was cut from the film, I was going to be more forgiving of AVP...but I can't. There may be hundreds of excuses as to why we are stuck with this version of the finished film...but to be honest, no excuse can justify AVP as presented. What was great about "Freddy vs. Jason" was that the film had the appeal of both series. "Freddy vs Jason" felt at times like a "Friday the 13th" film, and at others a "Nightmare on Elm Street" film, and the result was a really fun movie that took away nothing from either of the title characters. With "AVP" both the Alien creature and the Predator came out looking worse for wear, with humans looking stronger than both??!! The Alien creature, who terrorized humans for at least the first 3 films of that series, are treated as though they really didn't pose much threat to humans or Predators. The killing-machine-like Predator from the original film has evolved into a sympathetic creature, that actually allies itself with it's "cattle and prey"...humans? I think what also really hurt this movie was removing both creatures from their element. The Alien's should have remained in space, sometime in a distant future...not here on Earth in the present time. One of the key ingrediants of the Predator series, was the focus on heat and warm climate, the jungle in the first film, the heat-wave in the second. Suddenly the Predators are running around the Arctic? Too much was changed from both series backstories. Why suddenly throw in the "every 100 years" rule for the Predators? Why change the time-line regarding the Alien egg hatching and chest busting? It seems like this was just really lazy film making, and thrown together just to get this out for a Summer release. I mean really if this film represents the 45th script re-write...maybe they should have waited for number 46. I really wanted to like this movie....but I just can't recommend this one to anyone.</p></body></html>

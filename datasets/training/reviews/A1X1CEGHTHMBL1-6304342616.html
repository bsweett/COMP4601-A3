<meta name="summary" content="An ok Sci-Fi movie with some laughs built in!"></head><body><p>A massive alien spacecraft has fallen into orbit around the earth and communications channels are disrupted around the globe. David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) who is a communications expert sees a hidden transmission in the TV signals overriding the communication satellites. He tries to tell his ex-wife who works for the President of the United States but she blows him off thinking he doesn't really know what is going on. Suddenly dozens of large flying saucer shaped craft the size of a large city drop out of the mother ship and hover over the major cities of the world.<br /><br />Meanwhile Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith) is a military pilot on leave and gets up out of bed to see a flying Saucer as large as downtown Los Angeles hovering over the city. He leaves his girlfriend to return to the military base as he is recalled for immediate action and security....<br /><br />What follows is a pretty good Sci-Fi movie with some laughs built in. You have to take some of the movie with a grain of salt as parts are really far stretched but what good Hollywood movie isn't these days. The special effects are pretty good and the story line is not bad if you take out the alcoholic crop duster that can fly an F 18 Hornet with no flight training since the Vietnam War.<br /><br />There is a lot of action, special effects and some decent plot lines within the movie. If you just look at it as 2 hours of entertainment you will enjoy it. It shows mankind rising up in the face of total destruction at the hands of aliens who want our planet. The collection of miscellaneous personalities overcomes a superior force and technology to win the day. It is worth watching and you will have fun enjoying it.</p></body></html>

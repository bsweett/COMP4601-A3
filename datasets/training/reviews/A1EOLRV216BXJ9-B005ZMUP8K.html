Compared with the Curse of the Black Pearl, the plot may not be that alluring. Yet the movie should be credited for daring to be different from the first. Instead of monsters under moonlight and treasure hunt, here we have sea battles in daylight, leviathan and cannibals on a beautiful island. Moreover, Keira Knightley has a bigger role here - more adventurous, sophisticated and she looks charming. So does Bill Nighy (Davy Jones) in his own way.  It is interesting to see some mutual attraction between Elizabeth and Captain Sparrow. To be frank, Johnny Depp is still the one to watch. Without this Captain Sparrow, the movie will be just another big budget summer movie.</p></body></html>

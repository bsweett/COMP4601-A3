<meta name="summary" content="Ugly Betty with Some Sense"></head><body><p>This movie is miles better than the silly Ugly Betty program that is a big hit on tv which has a lot of similarities.  Ana, who dreams of being a journalist takes a job out of desperation with Runway Magazine.  Runway is the leading fashion magazine that is the leader in deciding which designers will have successful lines.  The magazine is run by Miranda (Meryl Streep in a vastly different role than the friendly psychologist in the recent Prime) who controls everything about the magazine and whose pursed lips expression can sink a whole fashion line.  Ana interviews with Miranda to be her assistant and has no clue as to who Miranda is (she even tells her so).  What's more Ana appears to have absolutely no clue for fashion (a la Betty) though she does have good looks.<br /><br />Miranda relegates Ana to running errands with virtually no explanation as to what she wants.  Also, she is plainly told she is the #2 assistant by Emily, who keeps telling Ana not to mess up because she will ruin Emily's chance to go to the big fashion show in Paris (Emily's entire life revolves around being able to go to the show and get all the clothes).  Ana, totally frustrated wants to quit, with great encouragement from her boyfriend.  She is on the verge when she is reluctantly helped out by Miranda's main fashion advisor.  He helps her to make over he look and right away things start to slowly go Ana's way and less Emily's way.<br /><br />The more Ana starts to suceed, the more she moves further away from her boyfriend, friends, and what she believed in and she starts becoming more like the type of person she always despised.<br /><br />The movie is highly entertaining and Streep is amazing in her role (way more ruthless than Glenn Close was in 101 Dalmations).  I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p></body></html>

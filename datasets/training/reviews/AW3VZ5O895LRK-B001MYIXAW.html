<meta name="summary" content="Swedish Vampire Movie"></head><body><p>Tomas Alfredson's directs this film from the novel and screenplay by John Ajvide Lindqvist's.  The film is in Swedish language with English subtitles.  The leads are a pre-teen boy and girl.  The boy is not a vampire.  He is having a terrible time in school holding his own against bullies. He lives alone with his single mother and doesn't have much of a life other than attending school, which is a nightmare for him.  Suddenly though, help is at hand.  A girl his age moves into his building and he slowly becomes aware that not only is she strange but she is also probably a vampire. Things begin to turn around for him as the vampire comes to his aid with the problems in his life.<br /><br />This film is ambiguous enough that you are not sure if this is a real vampire story or an imaginary vampire story.  Perhaps she exists in his own mind.  How do we know that he is not in his bed dreaming this or that his personality has split and part of it has wandered off? There is a dream like quality to this entire film. The way it moves and looks is very like a dream. This is just a possibility and I think its even being a small possibility adds to the film rather than subtracts from it. There is also the very Jungian notion that we each have an animus and anima part of our personalities (both male and female).  (We saw this notion of animus and anima in the two titular characters of Ingmar Bergmann's FANNY & ALEXANDER.)  So that there are two preteens in a vampire dream like atmosphere may be a dream itself is interesting. Or maybe it is just a boy, whose problems are solved by a vampire coming into his life.<br /><br />It is the style though of this film that catches one's interest.  It is so European and proceeds so unlike an American vampire tale.  I found one viewing of this film engrossing and interesting.  Its visual style is what I admired the most.  The novel has been a huge success but I have not read it so cannot compare it with the film.</p></body></html>

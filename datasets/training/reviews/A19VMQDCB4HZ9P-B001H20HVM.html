<meta name="summary" content="One of the rare sequels that actually improves on the original"></head><body><p>In 2004 actor-writer Leigh Whannel and firsttime director James Wan released a low-budget horror-thriller called Saw. The film made decent box-office and soon a sequel was greenlighted to take advantage of the new franchise while horror movies were hot. This time around Whannel has a different newcomer to direct Saw II. Darren Lynn Bousman was tapped to make sense of Leigh Whannel's script for the sequel. Once again, Whannel's talent in writing credible and non-cheesy dialogue is average at best and pretty so-so most of the time. The acting was serviceable and pretty decent for a horror flick. Most of the time acting's usually not the highest of priorities in such films. As long as the actors show a decent amount of talent on the screen then everything else they do is gravy.<br /><br />Once more the film takes the premise of a sort of demented gamemaster calling himself Jigsaw (again Tobin Bell plays the role with relish and aplomb) who takes individuals he's deemed as not worthy of the lives their leading and puts them in complex and demented games where there's only two options: live or die and the choice is up always up to the contestant. This time around Jigsaw has chosen eight people who at first has nothing in common with each other but as the story moves forward one thing ties them all together. A slow-acting nerve gas has been seeping into their boarded up room and they have two hours to solve puzzles that will give them acess to the antidote needed to counteract the nerve-agent. The twist this time around is that each puzzle also has a trap attached to it and sometimes solving the puzzle means having to shed blood. Blood that is either the participants or a bystander's. The gruesome traps range from hidden blades in glass boxes, an industrial furnace, a pit of used needles, etc... The pit of needles still give chills whenever I think about it.<br /><br />To add to this maze of traps and puzzles, Jigsaw also involves an outside character played by Donnie Wahlberg. Wahlberg's character is a burnt-out cop who has everything to lose if he doesn't play Jigsaw's game and his choice on how to play the game results in a twist at the end that wasn't easily seen and predicted. The twist in the end of Saw II was cleverly pulled off and added more to the demented genius that the Jigsaw character gives off. This character is fast joining the classic ranks of horror villains like Hannibal Lecter, Freddie, Michael Myers and Jason. I actually think he's one-upped the character of John Doe from Fincher's Seven. It helps that Tobin Bell has again put in another chilling performance as Jigsaw.<br /><br />Saw II delivers on everything that the first film had and improves on it with better pacing and tighter direction from Darren Lynn Bousman. With a bigger budget and more space to work with (an entire two story house instead of a single showerroom), Saw II added more action in addition to ramping up the disturbing scens of gore and deaths. Each death doesn't have the carnival glee that the Final Destination films have. Instead each death is meant to disturb and induce cringes and winces from its audience. The clever ending leaves for a second sequel to be made and I for one wouldn't mind visiting with Jigsaw and company one more time.</p></body></html>

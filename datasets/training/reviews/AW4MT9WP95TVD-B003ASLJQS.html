<meta name="summary" content="An Actors Film"></head><body><p>Beautiful performances from the cast make this one the worthwhile film that is. I enjoyed watching really good actors flex their muscles with strong tragic material, I guessed at the mystery and stayed glued to it until the end.  BUT, I never felt really involved.  A big part of me felt removed from the story so the dramatic and emotional impact was severely lessened.</p></body></html>

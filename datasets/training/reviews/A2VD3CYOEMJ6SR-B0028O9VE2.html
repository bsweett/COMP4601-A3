<meta name="summary" content="characters not believable"></head><body><p>This was a comedy with a pretty good plot and would otherwise deserve at least 4 stars. My problem is, however, that some of the characters are not believable in their roles. Tea Leoni, who plays Deborah Clasky,the wealthy wife of a highly successful chef and restaurant owner, played by Adam Sandler, is fabulous as a nuerotic Southern Californian. However, Sandler, who plays his role as a good natured type that you would expect him to play, is just not believable as the restaurant owner who becomes fabulously wealthy from the restaurant. He is not convincing as a world class chef who is also a businessman adept enough to make his restaurant into a multimillion dollar business.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a housekeeper named Flor, hire by Deborah, played by Paz Vega. She has a daughter, the same age as the Clasky's daughter, and as the housekeeper, her daughter, Christina, is well treated by the Clasky's. Flor has certain problems with the Clasky's largess since she is very proud. It could be a compelling plot but, Vega is almost as unconvincing in her role as Sandler is in his. She plays a Mexican who moved to Los Angeles and while living there, never left the barrio until landing her job with the Clasky's. However, she looks assimilated into Southern California culture. Even though she is initially unable to speak English, she nontheless has the look and mannerisms of a well coiffed, reasonably fashionably dressed Southern Californian. Given the nature of her role, she would be expected to come across as much more provincial.<br /><br />The movie had potential. The Clasky's daughter was overweight and ungainly and needed love which Flor tried to provide. Meanwhile, Christina was the daughter of an immigrant mother who, for the first time, was obtaining many of the finer things in life, including private schooling. The parents of each girl, at times, bristled at the interference of the other. The characters have to click, however, and although some do (most notably, the girls), some key characters do not. Therefore, my recommendation is only lukewarm.</p></body></html>

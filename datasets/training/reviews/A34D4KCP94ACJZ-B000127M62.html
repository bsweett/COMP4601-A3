<meta name="summary" content="A True Celebration of the Slasher Icons"></head><body><p>I hated Friday the 13th part IX: Jason Goes to Hell and the idea of making a film about Freddy and Jason squaring off was horrible but inevitable after we see Freddy bring Jason's hockey mask to hell with him. Well, I can admit I was somewhat wrong.  You see I was under the impression that the inept creators who made these later films would create this one too, but Freddy vs. Jason was in decent or at least very disturbed hands. The film hand picks the truly memorable elements about both stories and touches on all of them.  The parts that make them scary and somewhat convincing and the parts that reinforce the characters as legends and horror icons.  Freddy vs. Jason celebrates the mythology in an undeniably clever and tongue-in-cheek fashion.<br /><br />Freddy's legend is brought to an iconic status as we see girls jumping rope singing those Freddy rhymes and him getting burned by the vengeful parents of the Elm street children, they even gave us glimpses of Freddy's greatest moments. He consistently breaks out his puns and bad one-liners in vintage Freddy bravado and in many ways he is the lead character of the film.  The movie is actually from his perspective from the start. Jason's legend on the other hand is touched on only half way until later on when the two meet for the first time. We see images of his mother, her head, Jason drowning as a boy and children picking on him mercilessly.  We even get a short reference to Jason's potato sack wearing days in Friday the 13th part 2.<br /><br />Freddy's strength is the fear of the children on Elm Street and to fear him they must know who he is. I don't remember Nancy and Johnny Depp having to know who Freddy is to fear him but where would one of these films be without a plot-hole? So Freddy needs to get something going in reality (cause Freddy exists in dreams). He summons another dark force to bring chaos and fear to the real world Elm Street so the legend of Freddy is hyped-up all over again and he is allowed to flourish in all of the children's fear. Enter Jason Voorhees. But when Jason shows up he spoils all of Freddy's fun by killing everyone he can...and I mean everyone. Freddy can't stand it because everyone on Elm Street now fears Jason just as much as him but Freddy has gained enough power to make a comeback.  The stage is set for the modern day King Kong vs. Godzilla. Both opponents are worthy of the other and they do not disappoint in the least.<br /><br />What really makes the film entertaining is the violence and if you're a fan of these characters. Otherwise you're going to see some brutal deaths that will scare you because most fans are twisted enough to laugh at it and you won't understand why. Freddy vs. Jason contains perhaps more blood than any mainstream film I have ever seen (obviously it can't top Peter Jackson's Dead Alive). Still, the film has blood shooting to and fro in just about every direction in just about every death, and we see a lot of the death. It gets even bloodier when they finally meet in the real world at Camp Crystal Lake for the classic showdown. Freddy's Kung Fu and his wits seem to be the perfect match for Jason's brawn and complete invulnerability to any type of pain or dismemberment.<br /><br />Anyway, the film has plenty of laughs besides the usually amusing murder sequence. Consider this line after Jason marches through a cornfield toward a small rave party as he is engulfed in flames and kills a handful of people, "Dude that goalie was pissed about something".  Rumors still circulate that Michael Myers or Ash (from Evil Dead 2) might get into the mix but nothing has come out of it.  Slasher movie fans are a patient lot with lower standards than most but perhaps enough is enough.</p></body></html>

Redgrave adds Weight to the proceedings: something sorely lacking in this "Epic" love story.<br />With that being said, I found "Atonement" a very beautiful and stunningly produced film. For once, the shifting between time periods and between the lives of Briony (as a child, as a young woman and as an elderly woman), Cecelia (Keira Knightley) and Robbie (James McAvoy: finally coming into his own with this subtle, heartfelt performance) is not a problem, does not confuse but instead adds texture, friction and verisimilitude: this is a film of remembrance after all...of events, reactions and situations recalled by Briony at various stages of her life: a life seemingly dedicated to righting a wrong from her young life.<br />In fact, "Atonement" is a film of penance. A film about a Mistake, a Misinterpretation, a film about a child's misplaced, unwanted and unwarranted love gone awry. Director Joe Wright ("Pride and Prejudice") carefully even reverentially directs this material which in several ways reminds me of Lillian Hellman's "The Children's Hour" in that a child is at the center of a controversy and her words literally cause big problems for an adult. Oddly enough Briony and Mary in "TCH" are both of a so-called "elevated" social class while the object of their invective is not. Wright should have mined this conflict between classes a lot more than he does. As it is, it is dropped and instead "Atonement" becomes less than what it could have been.<br />McAvoy's Robbie, though from simple beginnings, is obviously meant for great things. His mentor is Cecelia's father and he is off to Cambridge very soon after the film begins. McAvoy plays him with just the right amount of bragadaccio and humility: he knows he's smart, he knows that he is a star yet he knows his place...at least for the time being. Knightley's performance is more problematic. Her reactions sometimes smack of something akin to that of an American high school cheerleader in their lack of depth and feeling.<br />But, no one can deny the sexual heat that she and McAvoy produce in their terrific scenes together. You truly believe that these two could/can/would bed each other: the penultimate scene of Cecelia and Robbie in the Tallis estate library both clawing at each other like two cats in heat... reeks of musk, bristling stiff starched clothing and silk underwear.<br />"Atonement" then is not a complete success but instead is an example of lost opportunities on the one hand and of a director adhering too close to the source material on the other. Despite all of this, this is a film of uncommon physical beauty. If only the thought processes behind this film could have matched or surpassed the physical concerns we would have had a major triumph here. As it is, "Atonement" is merely a good not a great film.</p></body></html>

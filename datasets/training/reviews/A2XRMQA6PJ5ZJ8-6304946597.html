<meta name="summary" content="One of the great ones!  An American warrior soldier."></head><body><p>"Patton" is an epic saga of one of the greatest generals of all time, a total American, and an imperfect but nonetheless great man.  George C. Scott as General George S. Patton is one of the greatest and best casting decisions of all time.  Scott becomes the general, and the role will forever define Scott, just as Scott's portrayal of General Patton will forever define the General in the minds of most Americans.<br /><br />This is a wonderful movie about a flawed but great man.  Like many or most American generals, Patton waited the better part of his career for a terrible war to occur, which would call forth all of the years of training and preparation, but mostly waiting, that go into the career of a professional soldier who happens to serve a basically peace-loving country.  Patton believed that he was born to lead great armies in a desperate battle, and this he did.  The film's depiction of Patton when he took over the Vth Corps in North Africa shortly after it took a shellacking from Rommel at Kassarine Pass was absolutely masterful.  Patton took a despirited, green American army there, and shortly, in his words, turned them into "razors ... fanatics!"  The American Expeditionary Force in North Africa never lost another battle after the brush at Kassarine, and Patton was established in the American mind as a great war general.<br /><br />The infamous "slapping incident" was portrayed painfully but, in the end, according to most historians, accurately.  Patton here is shown to have exercised misjudgment, but even here the discerning viewer will see that this was a misguided attempt by the general to inspirit a flagging soldier.  Scott handled this particular scene perfectly, as indeed he did the entire three hour film.<br /><br />Perhaps my favorite part of the film is when Patton leads the Third Army's relief of the 101st Airborne at Bastogne.  The British and other allied forces were paralyzed--Patton, having anticipated the possibility of a surprise German winter attack, wheeled several divisions 90 degrees, disengaged from the front, and attacked the advancing Germans in force, which broke the back of the German spearhead and won the Battle of the Bulge for the Americans.  The scene in this film where Scott/Patton "orders" an Army Chaplain to "pray to the Almighty for good weather...I want a good weather prayer..." is one wonderful scene, juxtaposed against horrendous scenes of combat as the Americans, tired but battle-hardened, advanced.<br /><br />Patton's difficulties with the press are well done in this film, and one wonders, with today's media the way it is, whether a great general like Patton could survive in our politicized times.  Lord help us when the day comes, as it will, when America needs another Patton.<br /><br />Scott's portrayal of Patton is one of the greatest character roles ever, and this is a great war film and character study of a great American general.<br /><br />The musical score by Jerry Goldsmith is a classic, and is one of those scores that greatly adds to the viewing experience of the film.  The DVD is an excellent reproduction of the film, and the sound is recreated/remastered into pretty good Dolby 5.1, which sounded great on my home theater system, if not quite as awesome as some modern films.  This is a great film and the DVD is a great value.</p></body></html>

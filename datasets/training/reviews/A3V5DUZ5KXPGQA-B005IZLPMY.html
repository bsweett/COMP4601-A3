In fact, of all the Avenger movies, this one is my favorite so far (though I DO love all of them). For those that like storylines, I would recommend watching this film first, then Iron-Man, then Incredible Hulk, then Iron-Man 2, then Thor. This film makes those other four make more sense as there are clues and elements (and character links) that show up in those movies that are shown here.<br /><br />On the film itself, I found it to be dramatic fun! The 3D effects in it I found satisfactory as well as the bonus features. I loved this film in the movies and I like it here. Would recommend the film itself no matter the format!</p></body></html>

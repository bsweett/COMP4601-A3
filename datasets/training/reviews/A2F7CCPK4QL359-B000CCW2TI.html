<meta name="summary" content="Close and Tight Thriller"></head><body><p>Ever been on a plane flight with a seat mate you wish would exit the plane while in midair?<br /><br />Red Eye is a thriller in the classic sense. Most  of lt takes place on a closed plane area...Think Lifeboat in a plane! It is psychological melodrama with a twist of political thriller. Under the  skilled direction of Wes Craven, this thriller ride takes flight. Craven  seem to take a page or two from the playbook from the Master of Thrillers, Alfred Hitchcock with a twist or two of  his own added in.<br /><br />Cillian Murphy (Scarecrow from Batman  Begins) is extra  creepy here as he sits next to Lisa (played by Wedding Crasher's Rachel McAdams). Murphy threats Lisa in his soft cooing voice with her father's death if she doesn't move a poltico pemarked for death  into a  special hotel suite. He does his threats  in such a way that anyone would be scared of him.The film is scary and supensiful due to Murphy's quiet anger. The political thriller angle  seem slightly taken  from the film "Nick of Time" with  Johnny Depp<br /><br />Craven is a master of fear and he shows it here. His audio commentary on the dvd is amazing disection of movies and thrillers in general. It is a mini film course in less than 9o minutes<br /><br />DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM WHEN YOU FLY!<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD</p></body></html>

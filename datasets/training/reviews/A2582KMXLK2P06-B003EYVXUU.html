The description didn't seem particularly enticing because it didn't reveal very much, but none of that matters now.  I made the decision to watch the movie anyway and it paid off wonderfully.  It's about a little kid around 12 who gets picked on by bullies at school and after school when it's dark and cold outside, he frequently meets up with (and eventually befriends) a demon girl his own age who has a craving for blood unbeknownst to the boy.  They hit off a friendship that's one of the more unusual ways to develop one, haha.<br /><br />What makes Let Me In work so well is how it perfectly blends sad emotions with just the right touch of orchestration in the soundtrack, and combines these feelings with the surprise and gruesome factor of the horror genre with tons of bloody, violent and unpredictable murders thanks to the demon girls neverending pursuit for blood.  Seems like a bad combination on paper doesn't it?  Well somehow, I loved it.  It's an odd combination, and at first I wasn't sure it'd even work but after watching the entire thing, I'm left to believe the writing is top-notch, intelligent and compelling.  The storyline flows with such ease that the only time you're really lost is right after the boy meets the demon girl and the girl ventures on her own for a little while.  However, everything eventually falls into place and makes sense.<br /><br />The bullies are exceptionally vicious and unforgiving, but that just makes the ending even better.  That basically covers what the film is about.  Might have to turn the volume up high however, because there's tons of whispering between the boy and girl.  It's really amazing just how much of a connection the two of them have.  I highly recommend Let Me In.</p></body></html>

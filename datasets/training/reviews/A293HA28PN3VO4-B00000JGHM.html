<meta name="summary" content="One of the best films of all time-stellar visuals, and performances!"></head><body><p>This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Al Pacino and Robert Dinero absolutely SIZZLE in this film. Michael Mann adds his brand of visual seduction, as the film's "blue" look and atmospheric music and scenes add a spectacular feel to this film. The "cat and mouse" game is complicated by the fact that we learn about the personal lives of all lead characters, and it truly allows you to "cheer for the bad guy". The movie, minute by minute, is one of the best crime sagas ever created. Fanastic cinema, highly recommended!</p></body></html>

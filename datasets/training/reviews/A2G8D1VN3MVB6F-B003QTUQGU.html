It had all the potential to be a great version of this wonderful movie, but instead it becomes very tiring. It is just a collection of Burton's past accomplishments wrapped up in the dressing of a classic. It just has many of the same old tired tricks that go no where quick. He could have innovated somewhere, as the book provides ample opportunity, but it never comes. Worth a redbox rental, but not worth buying.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Thought-provoking film, outstanding acting from Norton and Furlong"></head><body><p>This is a powerful movie that deserves all the respect it has gained.  It does not present a simple tale of right vs. wrong, but rather puts you in the shoes of people to see how skinhead ideals (or any racist ideals) can take over, and become all-consuming, and shape your life forever.  It's not at all a preachy story of a changed man, rather it is an intense portrait of a family hit by race issues, and the stuggles of each family member to come to terms with reality and find their own personal belief system.<br /><br />The story is told in flashbacks--it opens with Edward Norton's skinhead character getting out of jail for killing a black man.  Slowly, we learn the backstory of how he got to be the skinhead leader he was, and what happend to him in prison to make him look at the world differently.  I had tears in my eyes during the prison flashback segments.<br /><br />The Norton character gives many eye-opening monologues on his skinhead ideals.  There's just enough truth in what he says to make him dangerous.  It's very easy to see how disaffected youth, bullied by gangs, could turn to the skinhead ideals as a safe haven.<br /><br />This is an amazing movie about racist ideals and family ties.  Check it out if you can handle the realism and want to be blown away by some powerful messages.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Wow... what a hairy mess."></head><body><p>One of the biggest issues that I have with this film is the fact that it's a vanity project for Benicio Del Toro and it barely feels like Del Toro is barely there in the film. He has no opportunity to showcase his vast talents as an actor here, especially as an actor playing an actor (the "Alas, poor Yorick" scene from HAMLET that is showcased in the film is cringe-worthy... is Talbot supposed to be a bad actor?).<br /><br />While listening to the commentary track for SIN CITY, Directors Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller discuss Benicio's desire to play The Wolfman in a remake, and that is the proof in the pudding about where I got "vanity project" from. So that can end that debate.<br /><br />But the plot, at least to begin with, is identical to the Universal classic (it even has the old-school Universal logo at the opening). Lawrence Talbot, who had left his ancestral home in England for success in America as an actor. He comes back to his home after learning of the horrible death of his brother by what could be a maniac or some huge animal. He is greeted by his father, Sir John Talbot (played by Anthony Hopkins, channelling Hannibal Lecter AGAIN...), a famous big-game hunter who greets the "prodigal son" with the warmth of the English winters. He is also confronted by his deceased brother's fiancee, Gwen (played by Emily Blunt, who's performance is relegated to nothing more than a plot necessity), who quickly warms up to Lawrence... a lot more quickly than what one might expect from a grieving fiancee. Lawrence is also a man with a mission: to hunt the beast (or maniac) that killed him. He finds that his brother had some dealings with Gypsies that have put up camp nearby, and they are suspect because of their outsider status. He visits the Gypsy camp and the beast appears, and instead of exacting his vengeance, he is bitten by the beast. And the games then begin. Soon after the attack, an inspector from Scotland Yard comes to investigate: Inspector Mark Abberline (played with the barest vitality by Hugo Weaving), who is, in reality, one of the inspectors of the Jack the Ripper case, and there is a fleeting allusion to that in this film, but it is fleeting.<br /><br />This is pretty much where the similarities end. Aside from a little easter egg moment with Max Von Sydow giving Del Toro a silver-headed cane (that houses a hidden blade), the best of moments of this film come in the various animal attacks filled with gore, evisceration, beheadings and more... and some of the moments of the sparse character development.<br /><br />The biggest problem with this film is the fact that many of the people involved in the making of this film are extremely talented in their own right, but that talent is barely present throughout. As I stated, Del Toro is barely there. He plays some of the tortured elements of his character well, but that's about it. Hopkins plays to his specialty, which is chewing the scenery to nothing. Blunt is pretty much a ghost in this film. Her presence is barely there, and that's not her fault. She's been written into a corner that she has no way out of. Weaving is still channeling some of his Agent Smith persona (and can we have the line "God help us..." put on indefinite moratorium? Please?).<br /><br />Then there are the behind-the-camera people. Director Joe Johnston is someone who can make a really good film (OCTOBER SKY, THE ROCKETEER), but he's still a director that is so incredibly reliant on CG effects, as he learned in films like JUMANJI and JURASSIC PARK III, that he's forgotten the joy that can be seen and felt in practical effects. There are SO MANY composite shots in this film that you honestly feel like every exterior shot is somehow off-kilter, even if it is natural. And the CG feels INCREDIBLY rushed. If it worked better, I might think better of this film.<br /><br />Writers Andrew Kevin Walker and David Self do what they can to give more depth to the film as opposed to the simplicity of the original. In many areas, it doesn't work, sadly. Both of them have written terrific films in their career. Walker rocketed to instant acclaim with his amazing script for David Fincher's masterpiece SE7EN and did some polishing on Fincher's other masterpiece FIGHT CLUB. Self wrote ROAD TO PERDITION and THIRTEEN DAYS, both very underrated films. But here, they don't bring anything that really shines or haunts, which is what a great horror film should do. You should leave still feeling scared but exhilarated.<br /><br />The greatest tragedy of this film though sadly lies on the shoulders of SFX innovator Rick Baker, who is no stranger to werewolf films. He designed, created and reinvented the werewolf transformation in John Landis' AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, which treats you to the most agonizing and amazing transformation from human to wolf that has ever been committed to film. And the miracle of that was it was all done with PRACTICAL effects. There was no CG. It's still state of the art now, and that was fron 1982. And now with all the innovations in technology over the last 28 years, the design and the CG transformation for the Werewolves in this film are so incredibly fake that nothing is convincing. Not even the movement looks real for a moment. Think about that for a moment. Rick Baker has been given the opportunity and the technology to do something even more convincing than the pinnacle of his technical achievement than something he did 28 YEARS AGO, and it looks like a cheap UNDERWORLD knockoff.<br /><br />So yes, this film is a barely 2-star film because it does hold some interest for the viewer, but once you get to the end, you realize that you've just wasted more time than you would want to.</p></body></html>

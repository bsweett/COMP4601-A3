<meta name="summary" content="Johnny Cash Emerges as a Star as Rock 'n' Roll Emerges from Its Roots."></head><body><p>"Walk the Line" follows the life of country/rock star Johnny Cash (Joaquin Phoenix) from the genesis of his career in the mid-1950s until his marriage to June Carter (Reese Witherspoon) in 1968, as Cash develops his sound, struggles with his own frailties, and rock'n'roll emerges in Memphis against a bland landscape of American music. The film focuses on Cash's personal life and how his music expressed his conflicted personality, but we also see the legendary musicians of Sun Studios under producer Sam Philips: Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison, Elvis Presley, with whom Johnny Cash and Tennessee Three, as well as June Carter, toured the nation. Glimpses of the those musicians evoke the a lifestyle in the early days of touring, when there were no buses, no roadies, and no sleep. I didn't find the film especially sympathetic to Cash's first wife Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), but it is sensitive to June Carter's delicate position as a divorced woman very much in the public eye when divorce was not always acceptable.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon couldn't be better as off-and-on-again lovers Cash and Carter. Phoenix conveys Johnny Cash's eternal struggle to live up his ideals, his darkness, his love of music, and love for June Carter. Reese Witherspoon expresses Carter's commitment to working hard and pleasing her fans, sometimes through difficult circumstances and personal pain. Phoenix and Witherspoon did all of their own singing, having trained for 3 months under the tutelage of music producer T-Bone Burnett, and they sound great. Musician roles in the film were cast with musicians, which lends some welcome authenticity. Writer and director James Mangold, along with co-writer Gill Dennis, have done a great job of packing a lot of material from the most turbulent period in Johnny Cash's life -and one of the most exciting times in American music- into an entertaining and insightful film. The events of the film are based on Johnny Cash's 2 autobiographies, and he and June Carter had the opportunity to approve the actors who portray them before they passed away in 2003.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006 single disc): Bonus features include 10 deleted scenes with optional director's commentary, a theatrical trailer, a soundtrack promotional spot, and an audio commentary by director and co-writer James Mangold. Mangold's commentary is both personal and informative. He provides tidbits of additional historical information, talks about preparing for the film, details of filming, and the film's structure, as well as his conversations with Johnny Cash, his intentions and inspirations, and the film's themes as they reflect Cash's life and personality. Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish. Dubbing is available in French and Spanish.</p></body></html>

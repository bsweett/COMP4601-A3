<meta name="summary" content="Amazing Stunts and Funny Quips"></head><body><p>The stunts are amazing. Destruction and mayhem are in the extreme. The bad guys are intelligent and tough. The relationship between Willis and the young hacker played by Olyphant is entertaining. Using the daughter as the damsel in distress is a good idea. The original Die Hard is better, but this one is good and very exciting. I found myself saying aloud, "Wow!" at some of the stunts.<br /><br />The bad aspects are pretty minor for a movie like this. Multiple systems are hacked with less keystrokes than it would take to log onto most systems. There are highly improbably incidents that defy the imagination. Willis intentionally hits a flying helicopter with a car. No ramp or incline visible. A toy falls off a shelf and hits the delete key on a computer that is rigged to detonate a bomb at a very good moment for the good guys. I could go on, but I'll stop.<br /><br />The movie overwhelming strengths make up for the weaknesses. The Die Hard series have been remarkably consistent and "Live Free" is a good addition.</p></body></html>

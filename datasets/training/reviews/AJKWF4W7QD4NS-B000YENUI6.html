<meta name="summary" content="A spectacular thriller from David Cronenberg"></head><body><p>Though David Cronenberg has calmed down a bit from his "King of Venerial Horror" days of Videodrome, Shivers, Scanners, The Fly, Naked Lunch, and the like; he's still managed to craft his best film in years with Eastern Promises.  Re-uniting with his A History of Violence star Viggo Mortensen (in a much deserved Oscar nominated role), Eastern Promises tells the story of a mid-wife named Anna (Naomi Watts) who finds the journal of a Russian teenager who died during childbirth.  Soon enough, Anna learns that the girl had ties to a Russian mob family, headed by an old-school boss (Armin Mueller-Stahl).  Her search for the truth leads her to the boss' volitale son (Vincent Cassel) and his associate Nikolai (Mortensen), who appears to both warn and help Anna at the same time.  Frequently compelling and occasionally blood-curdlingly violent, Eastern Promises is one of those oh so rare films that actually manages to stay with you after the credits roll, and actually surprise you when something unexpected occurs.  Mortensen is spectacular in a finely nuanced performance that is undoubtedly the best of his career.  Even the smaller details, from his body full of tattoos, to his accent, to his sheer physical nature, are superbly detailed and authentic.  As for Cronenberg, he seems to have transcended from being regarded as a master of the horror genre to a master of the thriller, and his brilliantly orchestrated bath house knife fight is brilliant film making.  All in all, you won't see many films, mainstream or not, of the past couple years that are better than Eastern Promises, and here's hoping that this isn't the last collaboration between Mortensen and Cronenberg.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another great sports movie"></head><body><p>This is a comedy and a drama and another great sports movie.  If you want to see my list of great sports movie check out my review of Friday Night Lights.  Lots of laugh but there is some drama.  Its another great Sandler movie.  Spanglish and Punch Drunk Love saw parts of both of them and couldnt get into either of them so I didnt finish watching them.  Anyway The Longest Yard is a good movie.  And the music in it is good to.  Cortney Cox is hot and she shows her cleavage and wow.</p></body></html>

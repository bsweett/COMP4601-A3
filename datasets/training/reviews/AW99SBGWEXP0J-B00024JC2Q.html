<meta name="summary" content="Starsky & Hutch"></head><body><p>tarsky & Hutch is the latest 70's television show to receive an upgrade to the movie screen.  Was this necessary?  Probably not, but the result is a really funny movie.  Taking the "Brady Bunch" approach, and placing their tongues firmly in cheek, Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson assume the roles made popular on the small screen so many years ago.  Ben Stiller is the somewhat anal Starsky and Owen Wilson is the laid back Hutch.  And while there is a plot somewhere in there, the movie's focus is the relationship between the two.  After being teamed together, they are out to bust a drug dealer, played by Vince Vaughn, who has developed cocain that cannot be detected by narcotics dogs.  The plot allows them to go undercover, get some girls, and have some action scenes.  I firmly believe that there will be a sequel to this, especially if the film does well (which I think it will).  Stiller and Wilson have a comroderie that has worked well in previous movies, and is even more evident here.  If you are looking for a laugh, check out Starsky & Hutch.</p></body></html>

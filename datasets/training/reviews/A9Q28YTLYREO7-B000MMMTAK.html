I don't find Cohen that funny on a whole. all the stereotype situations gets tired real fast. I watched his Ali G show and truth be told he pretty much does the same thing over&over on a whole.  had he truly challenged himself this might have been worth seeing instead of being predictable.</p></body></html>

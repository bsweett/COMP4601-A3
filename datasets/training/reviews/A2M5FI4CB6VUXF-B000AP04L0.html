The acting and story line take back stage to outrageous laughs and gags that never fail to deliver.<br /><br />It's honestly the most unreal story in the world, but it's a way that the common man can live vicariously through the actors. Who hasn't wanted to really just sluff off at work? Who hasn't felt underappreciated? Who hasn't thought that the office itself would fall apart if they left?<br /><br />One word of caution to take from this, however. Don't steal your co-worker's stapler!</p></body></html>

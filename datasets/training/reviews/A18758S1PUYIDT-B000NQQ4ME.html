However....it is extremely gruesome at times for no good reason (leave it to Mel Gibson--he doesn't want you to use your imagination; he has to make you look at the cruelty and the sacrifice and so on; after all, he made TPOTC), and the end leaves you wondering if there was any point or purpose at all.  And what became of the orphaned group of kids?  Well, Mel?</p></body></html>

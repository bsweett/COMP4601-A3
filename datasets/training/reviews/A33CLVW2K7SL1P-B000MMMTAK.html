Like Trey Parker and Matt Stone, co-creators of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00023P49C">South Park</a>, in "Borat...", many of the laughs fall into the category of toilet humor. This movie is my main exposure to Cohen. I saw a few episodes of his TV show prior to the movie, but just like watching a few episodes of South Park couldn't possibly prepare me for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000022TSW">South Park - Bigger, Longer & Uncut</a>, I had no idea what I was in for.<br /><br />While Cohen isn't concerned about a "message", we see one immediately when he arrives in New York. His overeager attempts to greet New Yorkers with kisses are met with hysterical results. One man quite literally runs into and down the street to escape him; others threaten him with great bodily harm.<br /><br />Borat is supposedly in the "U.S. and A" to film a documentary for his country, Kazakhstan. While in his hotel room, he sees an episode of Baywatch, and falls in love with C.J. During a meeting with feminists - hysterical - he finds that she lives in Malibu, CA, and so decides to travel cross-country and ask Pamela Anderson to marry him.<br /><br />I won't go through the so-called plot, because the fun is in the spontaneity of the humor, but there is one incident I'd like to address.<br /><br />On the way to California, he schedules various stops to learn more about American culture. One such stop is at a rodeo in Roanoke, VA, where he angles his way into singing the national anthem - but he chooses to sing it with the words of his country's own anthem supplanting ours. Before singing, he espoused great support for the war on terror, and hoped that George Bush would drink the blood of every single [Iraqi]. This was met with thunderous applause. But then he started to sing, and asserted that Kazakhstan was the greatest country in the world. What struck me as odd here was that nobody started to boo until he declared that Kazakhstan was the #1 exporter of potassium, and that their potassium was the best. Honestly, I don't think anybody knew what they were booing about, other than someone was saying that a country other than theirs was #1. Again, Cohen wasn't going for a message, just a reaction, but we got one loud and clear. It was even clearer in the extras, where news coverage for that event was shown and the newscaster declared that Borat was "bashing" everything from the war to the Bush administration, which was a flat-out lie.<br /><br />Borat's trip took him through the South, and as one reviewer indicated, the South has been picked on considerably, and it would have been interesting to inspect the reactions of his radical behavior when applied to Midwesterners. I agree. That would have been an interesting approach. My gut tells me, though, that it wouldn't have been as funny.<br /><br />Borat's fear and hatred of the Jew was, to me, humorous, mainly because they were shown, during one of his "interviews," to be ill-founded and silly. Indeed, that particular scene, where he rented a room from an elderly Jewish couple, spoke loudly to the tumult in the Middle East, and the pointlessness of the hatred that is there so deeply ingrained.<br /><br />The Bonus Features weren't all I hoped them to be. Other than the enlightening Roanoke news broadcast, nothing that had been "censored" was as funny or pointed as what was in the film, so those were judicious cuts.<br /><br />Also, the extras were neither subtitled nor closed captioned. I don't understand why, when the movie grossed almost fifteen times what it cost to make (this virtually guaranteeing that the DVD will be successful), they couldn't spend the extra money and subtitle and/or caption the extras, as they did for the film itself. More and more producers of DVDs are doing this now, and for those of us who are hearing impaired, it makes a difference - the difference being that we might not buy a DVD if we don't think the special features/extras will be accessible to us.<br /><br />4? out of 5.</p></body></html>

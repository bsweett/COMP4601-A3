<meta name="summary" content="A Singular Experience--Not A Modern War Epic"></head><body><p>I knew from the start that "Jarhead" had the potential to be a polarizing film. Any time you address a contemporary and controversial political topic--you end up with reviews at both ends of that political spectrum. In other words, it's generally a love it or hate it proposition. It's either genius or its crap. After the film received decidedly mixed reviews upon its release, it's not something I rushed out to see. However, to my amazement, the film is surprisingly apolitical. It's a simple tale with a few observations about the nature of modern warfare, but no real message.<br /><br />I see most of the negative reviews posted here disparage the film because it's not a war film. True enough, but that doesn't complete negate the movie either. I do think that the film works as a character study, a slice of life. It was interesting to me how the expectations of what the experience would be like were thwarted with what this team actually encountered. The boredom, insecurity and need to feel a part of something important are a valid statement. After all, this was basically one guy's experience. And "Jarhead" is successful enough at showcasing that one element.<br /><br />Now, I will admit the talent associated with the film led me to believe that this would be an "important" film. It doesn't have the flair and audacity of "Three Kings," for example. It's a more mundane story that shows a different aspect of battle, or lack thereof. It may not be what you're expecting--but that doesn't always make it bad. And it's definitely a well made picture with some amusing moments and some good performances.<br /><br />"Jarhead" is a compelling study of a disaffected youth in a profession he questions. The story is not uncommon. In this case, though, the backdrop just happens to be Iraq. KGHarris, 10/06.</p></body></html>

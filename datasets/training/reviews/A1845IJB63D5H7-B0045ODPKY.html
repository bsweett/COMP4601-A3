<meta name="summary" content="Well done. Will keep you engaged from start to end."></head><body><p>After watching "The A-Team", I was left with deep contempt to action moviemakers. "Salt" restored my confidence that an action movie could be educational, entertaining, and spiritually uplifting.<br /><br />From the start to the end, the scenario appeared logical, smart, and ingenious. From North Korea, to Washington DC, to New York, and Moscow, you get a sense of reaching around the globe in a matter of minutes. The severe torture of a woman by the North Koreans will leave you traumatized until the next and more painful episode ensues. In those brief and intense moments, my mind was split between the agony and sacrifices of a women involved in acting as a way of living and the parallel lifestyle of real official government spies. Either way you look at it, the insult outweighed the gain.<br /><br />The tortured and patriotic American spy is transformed in a snap into a traitor and fugitive  while the viewer was still recovering from her gruesome torture scenes. The apparently ruthless and calculated spy possessed a soft spot for building and guarding her love nest. The escape of the accused traitor and the chase by the feds occupied very good part of the action and never appeared boring or excessive. Without a single bone broken from jumping from the roof to the top of a moving truck, followed by another, and a third, the viewer will still be left gripped with dilemma facing an apparently innocent woman.<br /><br />The third episode of sneaking and disrupting a high level security funeral blended very well with the previous two episodes. You could easily forgive the moviemakers for exaggeration by making a lone and weak woman to cause such upheaval in such heavily secured settings.<br /><br />Then, in the wolves den, the weak and lone woman managed to take revenge for her lost love by eliminating those who did him and her harm. The scene of the Russian rebels in the Brooklyn harbor was as impressive as it could be. Dancing with wolves and getting out alive sounded within reach with smart planning.<br /><br />The questionable double spy or traitor will soon unveil other spies in her next assignment to steal the nuclear arsenal of America. In the White House, the long sleeper spy reveals his ugly face during a critical moment of nuclear survival.<br /><br />Putting a feeble yet determined woman at the center of action made the "A-Team" look miserably poor. The movie was filled with action, plotting, and twists of human nature that made is a real piece of art. Doctors should envy the neural scan that performed brain imaging without cumbersome magnets, specialized hospital rooms, or IV dyes.</p></body></html>

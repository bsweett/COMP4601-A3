<meta name="summary" content="Realistic Look at Odessa Texas Football Heroes"></head><body><p>Friday Night Lights depicts the 1988 Season of the Permian Panthers from Odessa Texas.  The film makes clear that Odessa is one of those West Texas towns where high school football is more than the community religion.  Nothing in Odessa matters other than winning the state football championship.  I wonder how the next Einstein or Condoleeza Rice or Colin Powell would react to being raised in such a community. All individual and community self-esteem is tied up in this single-minded goal.  Former Permian players parade around town proudly displaying THEIR state championship rings, and there seems to be no other source of community pride.  There is no sense of the Olympic ideal "the essential thing is not to have conquered, but to have fought well".  The well-fought fight is not appreciated in Odessa and the film is filled with scenes where Head Coach Gaines (in a wonderful performance by Billy Bob Thornton) is reminded over and over by community leaders that anything less than a state championship is unacceptable.<br /><br />I always wonder about individuals and groups who tie so much of their own happiness to the outcome of sporting events.  Thornton gives us brief glimpses at the idea that Coach Gaines recognizes that even the State Championship Game is, after all, only a game.<br /><br />A group of barely-known actors make up the team.  We recognize the more grownup Lucas Black (the kid from "Sling Blade") once again paired with Billy Bob, this time as the quarterback filled with self-doubts, even as he leads the Panthers to the State play-offs.  Derek Luke brings his chiseled body to the part of Boobie Miles, the star running back who is on the fast track to the NFL - until he tears his knee up with a mixture of bad luck and bravado.  Grover Coulson is terrific as Boobie's Uncle L.V., who took over raising the young man after Boobie's parents were out of the picture.  L.V. clearly wants what's best for Boobie, but you can also see that he knows Boobie is so close to the NFL and it's riches that he can taste it. The most heartbreaking scene in the film comes after Boobie is evaluated by an out of town Orthopedist who tells Boobie that his ACL is torn and he won't be able to cut any more, then Boobie and L.V. get together to mislead Coach Gaines into thinking that Boobie will be able to play.<br /><br />Garrett Hedlund stars as the other running back with a tendency to drop the ball and with an abusive alcoholic father who flashes his own State Championship Ring between drunken fits of child abuse.  Tim McGraw continues the Billy Bob connection by having another well-known country singer playing a scumbag.  (Following Sling Blades' Dwight Yoakum.) The DVD includes a documentary about the "real" Panthers and suggests that the "real" Charles Billingsley was only intense rather than an abusive drunk.<br /><br />The film is shot like a documentary, and it was about 15 minutes into the movie before it started feeling like a movie at all.  This adds to the "realism", but also creates a little shakiness to the viewing experience as hand-held camera shots wiggle the main characters through the frame.<br /><br />I knew nothing about the "real" story before seeing the film, but it is clear that you are moving toward a State Championship Game - and early on you see that the opponents are going to be a team from Dallas made up of players that look like they outweight the Panthers by about 50 pounds per player.  The Panther's trip to the big game hits a few speed bumps while the team from Dallas looks like an unbeatable behemoth.<br /><br />By the end of the film I had the reassuring sense that as a result of this season the community of Odessa had a better appreciation for the "well fought fight".  You'll see what I mean.</p></body></html>

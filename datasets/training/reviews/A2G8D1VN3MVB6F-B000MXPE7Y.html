It was boring, so boring I would rather have watched a cia agent pick their nose for three hours. the story was slow, some of the facts fictionalized, and the filming shakey. The skull and bones stuff is somewhat on target with the founding, i would argue, but the rest of it is just bad. There were too many possible storylines that could have been followed, but were not. They just hung there for a little bit and were ignored. simply very, very bad.</p></body></html>

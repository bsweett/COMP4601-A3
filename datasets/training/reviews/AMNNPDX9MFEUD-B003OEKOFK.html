<meta name="summary" content="Raunchy and over-the-top good time"></head><body><p>Yeah, I know it's a movie that could be easily torn to shreds but the previews were enough to spark my interest and so I saw it on a lark with some friends at a discount showing and we were all three laughing throughout. Just to be sure it wasn't a fluke; I saw it again just now on dvd and it was still funny.<br />Look, I fully understand that the world needs another movie that celebrates the stupid like we need another religion, but for whatever reason, this movie made me laugh and I had a great time.<br />The in-jokes are rampant, all the way down to the Karate Kid reference topped by a cameo from the villain from said series. There is an excess of pointless nudity, f-bombs galore, and a plot as thin as the lines of coke drawn on the mirror in the many drug scenes. Even though this is not a movie you watch to point out the flaws, the 80s version of me demands I point one out: the total cognizance of John Cusack an hour or so after downing `shrooms, coke, pot, and a ton of booze. Somehow he is still John Cusack, i.e. a dronish bore of an actor with a very limited emotional range. To those who claim his career has taken a down slide, I have to ask from where? He's never been that great but he does seem to be fairly ubiquitous, so someone likes to see him in movies. Then again, he plays the same character he always plays - the self-obsessed navel-gazer - so maybe that's the joke. Fortunately he doesn't have to carry the movie. That task is handled joyfully by Rob Corddry, the man who makes this movie work.<br />If you are easily offended and/or don't like the content I've outlined, you will hate this movie. If you like raunchy yet wink-wink clever, you'll find this a very good time.</p></body></html>

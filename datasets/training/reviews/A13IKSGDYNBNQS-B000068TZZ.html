<meta name="summary" content="Tarantino arrives"></head><body><p>Quentin Tarantinos debut film is a heist movie, where you only see the aftermath of the heist and not the heist itself. Somehow, in his first film, Tarantino arrives as the complete filmmaker; as both a writer and director he delivers.<br /><br />The film opens with a wonderful scene in a coffee bar, where the gang are meeting. This is a classic Tarantino moment. Essentially nothing happens except for an argument about a tip, but thats the whole point, its very real, and it is marvellously well written. And its in this scene that you realise that you may be about to watch something special:<br /><br />Harvey Keital, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi & Lawrence Tierney - its a fabulous cast.<br /><br />After the Coffee bar scene the opening credits role and Tarantinos trademark use of music hits you. I don't know how he does it but rather like Scorcese, Tarantino finds what you might think would be a completely inappropriate piece of music and fits it to the most odd situations. Remember 'Goodfellas' when the outro to 'Layla' is playing and the bodies are discovered in the car. Its that sort of thing, and somehow Tarantino makes it work.<br /><br />After the heist the gangsters arrive at a warehouse. How they got there is shown in flashback. This is an extremly violent film, and in its day was very controversial for one scene where Mr Blonde tortures a policeman. The given names (Blonde White Orange etc) for the gangsters are a reference to the film 'The Taking of Pelham 123'. The bulk of the film takes place in the warehouse. The gangsters arrive one by one and it becomes apparent that one of them is a Policeman undercover. Essentially thats it, telling you more would spoil it.<br /><br />Worth mentioning that the late Chris Penn appears in the film as 'Nice Guy Eddie', and there is one scene where he is in a car on a mobile phone. So what you might say - but remember this was filmed 16 years so the mobile phone is the size of a brick!<br /><br />This is a great film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="&quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; takes flight"></head><body><p>A very interesting thriller that explores many of the same themes as the recent remake of &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, in &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; Ashton Kutcher finds that he has the ability to travel back in time by essentially reliving his memories based on his journals. The problem is that whenever he makes any changes, there are always disasterous and unpredictable consequences of his alteration of the past (hence the relationship to &quot;chaos theory&quot; and the term &quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot;, i.e., a butterfly taking flight can have a dynamic effect on weather conditions making complete prediction impossible). <p>The film's dark vision doesn't make this light entertainment. Still, it's a very interesting and well made film that challenges the viewer's preconceptions. The kids cast in the film give strong, convincing performances. Ashton Kutcher does a solid job in his role as Evan &quot;the time traveler&quot; but he doesn't always have the dramatic depth to communicate everything he could. Still, he does an exceptional job with the skills he has to work with. He's proven that he can carry more than a comedy picture.  Amy Smart, in particularly, plays a variation on the same character many, many times with major differences depending upon how the timeline was altered. <p>I personally preferred the original theatrical ending. Why? Because creating hope out of hopelessness is an essential part of our humanity. The nilistic director's cut doesn't add anything and makes the character's sense of discovery worthless if there's no dramatic payoff that the audience can buy into. <p>The infinifilm features on the DVD allow you to watch short commentaries,a breakdown of visual effects, alternate takes,storyboards, deleted scenes with and without commentary then return immediately to the film. While it doesn't provide as much depth as a series of featurettes (or director's commentaries), it provides a thumbnail sketch of how the film took shape. <p>I'd be curious to hear the writers/directors take on the original ending vs. the theatrical cut. I won't say anything about the two except that one is more hopeful while the other is very, very dark. The latter ending made the film less pleasant for me. Sometimes the audience is right about the film and the artist wrong. In this case, I'd have to argue for watching the theatrical cut first and using the infinifilm feature to view the alternate, original ending of the film. It's the best way to gage them and compare them. <p>The DVD picture quality is pretty good overall on this dual sided single layer disc. The sound quality was a bit problematic at times as the version I purchased had some problems with distortion (which has become more and more of a problem with DVDs now that more of them are being pressed). My only complaint (a minor one at that) is that there isn't a director's commentary track. <p>&quot;The Butterfly Effect&quot; isn't a perfect thriller but it doesn't need to be; the questions it raises and the genuine suspense created by not knowing the outcome of each change in the past makes it an enjoyable film to watch. Yes, there's a lot of dark stuff that happens shaping the events in the lives of these kids but it that is the essence good drama.</p></body></html>

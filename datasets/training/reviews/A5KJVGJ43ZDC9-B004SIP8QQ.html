As a film ignoramus, I was not equipped to figure out just what films Tarantino is flashing to, but I could tell that he was doing just that consistently throughout this movie(I think I caught one particular Shaw Bros reference, but I can't remember the name of the flick for the life of me). Anyway, be prepared for a considerably lower body count than Vol.1-The Bride basically finishes off her list after being shot with rock salt, buried alive, and drugged. Watching her put down the miscast Daryl Hannah(she can't do mean) is definitely eye candy. That was a very bad pun, by the way, as you will find out should you see this. And you should.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Still quite entertaining, but easily the weakest of the Three Shrek films"></head><body><p>My wife and I recently watched Shrek the Third on HD DVD. On HD DVD viewers should be impressed with the beautiful picture, nice bright colors and excellent detail on the animation and this disc doesn't disappoint at all. Prince Charming's hair flows in various directions, shadows and lighting throughout show great attention to detail by the animators/rendering team, etc.<br /><br />Story wise this was, as most critics seemed to point out, probably the weakest of the 3 movies, but not bad. If the first two movies hadn't set the bar so high, this one would have been better received, but a lot of the sight gags and inside jokes have been done in the first two movies, so you aren't as shocked and don't react as well this time.  (Note that there is one great sequence with the Gingerbread man {Gingy} that is almost worth the price of the disc by itself.)  Be aware that this film is also somewhat darker at longer periods of time (story wise) than in the first two movies.<br /><br />I have some questions about the extras that are available for this movie, as I'm curious if the web enabled updates will (as they should) add content over time for this title.  For example, my wife was looking for a segment of the Puss-in-boots dance similar to the Donkey dance segment that is available in the extras/web content.  If that sort of content is made available later, then the web enabled updates features will prove to be quite valuable for a movie like this.<br /><br />Worth the purchase price to me, but I suspect this one is more likely a rental for many viewers. I would love to see it packaged up as the Shrek Trilogy so that I could get the first two movies in HD (I have both on DVD, first movie on two disc DVD I think). If that is done, I hope they don't cheap out on the extras and include as much as they can in the set.</p></body></html>

Tommy Lee Jones's character, Agent K, likens it to the exile world of &quot;Casablanca&quot;, and it's a apt comparison. But the worst problem facing the poor exiles of &quot;Casablanca&quot; was Louis Renault's arbitrary gendarme; certainly, giant intergalactic bugs that suck the guts out of humans and wear their skins as a disguise never made an appearance at Rick's Cafe Americain.<p>And where is this sci-fi &quot;Casablanca&quot;? New York, of course.<p>&quot;Men In Black&quot; veers wildly from sly comedy to slapstick and fairly standard sci-fi action. There are the requisite sci-fi trappings, like ray guns, flying saucers, a fancy high-tech headquarters, and cool gadgets. But &quot;Men In Black&quot; takes these kinds of sci-fi conventions and turns them on their ear; Agent J (Will Smith) is issued his ray gun sidearm, it's a tiny affair called the &quot;Noisy Cricket&quot;. But as it turns out, the Noisy Cricket is roughly as powerful as a rocket launcher. The Men In Black's requisite high tech headquarters doubles as a kind of intergalactic customs office where aliens man the communications console AND the coffee maker, and like to smoke Marlboros. <p>This sort of &quot;anything goes&quot; tone works well for &quot;Men In Black&quot;, at least for its first half. Agent K even instructs J in the fine art of finding aliens. Does he use some kind of super-advanced technology to do it? Nope. He reads the National Enquirer.<p>Jones is all seriousness as Agent K, a man who's literally been there and done that, and listened to Elvis while it was happening; Smith is at his streetwise best as K's partner J, who has an affinity for chasing down aliens and smack talking 50-foot-high giant bugs that have 70 million children (as the bug stares J down, he crushes a cockroach and asks 'Was that your auntie?').<p>I won't even begin to describe the over-the-top plot, but suffice it to say that the film's villain (Vincent D'Onofrio) is an intergalactic bug who inhabits the skin of a redneck farmer (Vincent D'Onofrio) and isn't real fond of humans, especially ones that hurt bugs. <p>That kind of irreverent, 'anything goes' tone works well for &quot;Men In Black&quot;, but unfortunately, the movie bogs down when it goes for standard summer action fare about halfway through. It's also a shame that director Barry Sonnenfeld couldn't find more for the excellent Linda Fiorentino to do in this film.<p>Still, even when &quot;Men In Black&quot; resorts to standard action-flick conventions (the street chase, for example), the tongue-in-cheek attitude remains, and that's the film's biggest strength.<p>It bears noting that the DVD has any number of excellent features that make it a nice buy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Some Good, Some Bad"></head><body><p>With the cast, and hype of this film at the time of its release, I expected something more, something akin to "Saving Private Ryan".....but it wasn't to be.....although this DVD wouldn't be part of my collection if I didn't like it. Also, I hear the Blu-Ray version is excellent so that's tempting to buy.<br /><br />"We Were Soldiers" had things I appreciated that are rare in today's action films: 1 - a pro-military film concerning a Viet Nam war battle; 2- fairly tame language. This is not pro-Viet Nam War.  Hollywood would never do that, but at least it shows the soldiers in a solid, valiant light. It's also refreshing to see good references to God and prayer.<br /><br />It's  this film that I thought the violence was overdone, not "Saving Private Ryan."  The action here doesn't start for 40 minutes, but when it does it loud, it's heavy and it's continuous over most of the next 95 minutes.Shorter periods of the violent scenes would have made this much better, maybe even an "excellent" film.<br /><br />Madeline Stowe had a memorable scene delivering message of war deaths to their spouses. That was touching stuff. But, mostly, this is an action film and the battle scenes are gruesome at times, particularly near the end of the film.</p></body></html>

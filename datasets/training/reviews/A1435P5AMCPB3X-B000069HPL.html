This was Mike Judge's live action directoral debut, and he hit this out of the ballpark.  Known for bevis and butt head and King of the Hill, Judge placed together and excellent cast to bring out the best humor that many of us can relate to in a close quareters office based setting. From the Fax Machine to the Memo's, to The overall dissatisfaction and unfulfillinness of the job.  The there is Milton...just an awsome character.  Laugh until it hurts.  Buy this movie, you will watch it over and over, worth the investment</p></body></html>

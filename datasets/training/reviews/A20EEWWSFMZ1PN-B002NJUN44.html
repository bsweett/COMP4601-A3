<meta name="summary" content="Formula "coming of age hero" series type pilot"></head><body><p>We see the prehistory of the present day and cut to Eragon (Ed Speleers) before he realizes his destiny, hunting; he come across the standard virgin (Sienna Guillory) and a unique stone.  Eragon meets the standard characters as his soon to be mentor Brom (a dirty faced Jeremy Irons).  Soon circumstance will force this farmer's nephew, Eragon to have to blossom into the prototype hero. He is joined by a dragon, Saphira (voice of Rachel Weisz) that imprints on coming out.<br />Will he rise above his fears and save the princes?<br /><br />I cannot help but feel that the characters are just walking through their parts. On course if you are young and impressionable and have not seen this standard story before it may not be noticed. I used to watch "The Cisco Kid" and was impressed as a child.<br /><br />Naturally, there is nothing one can say to the reader of books except that many times, as with this example, the transition to the big screen will lose a lot of the story. However, the screenwriter did not have to tell his own story, even if it is needed to keep up the momentum. The movie does look like a pilot so maybe more will come in a sequel or a TV show.<br /><br />See the story much better done as "Star Wars" (1977) the farmer's nephew must become a hero after his uncle was burnt to a crisp. Only the mentor is Obi-wan and Saphira, our dragon is two robots and a Chewbacca.<br /><br />This film can be fun but there is nothing exceptional. Reading Joseph Campbell ahead of time can add a richer dimension to the story.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EN71DG">Star Wars Trilogy</a></p></body></html>

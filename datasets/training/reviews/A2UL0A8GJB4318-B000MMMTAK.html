<meta name="summary" content=""Borat" Has More on His Mind Than Comedy"></head><body><p>"Borat," the twisted comedic gem from the brilliant, alert mind of Sacha Baron Cohen has one thing on its mind: exposing the ugly bigotry still festering just beneath America's seemingly welcoming, cosmopolitan society.  Cohen's antics as clueless and helplessly hateful Kazack reporter filming a documentary about America and searching to wed Pamela Anderson provide different Americans with an assumededly safe launching point to talk freely about their own prejudices.  Cohen also gets in a naked man-fight, rides around with a protective bear, makes out with his sister and pokes fun at the mentally challenged and the Jews, but that is all beside the point.  Cohen's real mission is to make America stare into it's own still prejudiced heart.  A rodeo cowboy in Georgia generalizes all Muslims as terrorists and admits he would want to see every single homosexual hanged, and the rodeo crowd cheers when Cohen says that George Bush should drink the blood of every man woman and child in Iraq.  A bunch of drunk frat boys casually admit slaves in America would be a good thing and that women are dumb, weak and should be subserviant to men, to say nothing of their attitudes toward the Jews.  These exchanges are funny, but in an almost frightening way.  America should have exorcised these flaws long ago, but they still stick around, waiting to rear their ugly head, if they are given the right catalyst of course.  Cohen's strategy does not always work, as some scenes (the dinner in a southern mansion, humor lessons with an Amerian instructor) sacrifice the social satire for more routine laughs about cultural divide.  But when the commentary kicks in, the implications for American society, now and in the future, are hard to ignore.</p></body></html>

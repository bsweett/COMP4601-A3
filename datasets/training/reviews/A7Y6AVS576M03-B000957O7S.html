The trailers did not do this film justice. Will Smith is HITCH the "Date Doctor" for males who just want to get the girl of their dreams as is the case with Kevin James. Others clients are not so noble of heart. In the mean time HITCH is also trying to get the girl of his dreams. I liked this film immensely because the script is well thought out and the bottom line here is that these guys envision the girl of their dreams as someone they want to be with and love for the rest of their lives. HITCH's intentions are based on good old fashioned notions of what it means for a man to love a women and the commitment that goes with that.</p></body></html>

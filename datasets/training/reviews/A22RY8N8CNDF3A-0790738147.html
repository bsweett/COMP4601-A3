Police Department, beautiful mysterious movie look-alikes, a quirky dirt magazine reporter, smart quick dialogue,perfect ensemble, and unexpected traps in every corner.<br /><br />Director Curtis Hanson does a fantastic job showing the two-faces of Los Angeles.  His view of the city and the perfect tone of the dark, exciting story grab you at the start.  The city of dreams is caught as well as the dark side.  The beginning is narrated by Danny DeVito who elaborates on L.A. glamour, sun and fun, ritzy homes and Hollywood celebrities and hopefuls.  Danny plays a reporter for "Hush-Hush" magazine so he also shows the duplicity of L.A. with its high-class hookers, murders, and corrupt cops.<br /><br />L.A. Confidential shows how hard it is to know who you can trust, who is watching your back or the criminals.  There are three detectives (Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kevin Spacey) who are smart and clever in their own unique ways.  They are investigating a coffee-shop mass murder and as each thread of evidence unravels, they discover more and more corruption in the Police Department.<br /><br />The three detectives use their own unique personalities and tactics to delve into the investigation of a mass murder at a small coffee shop.  The tenor and quality of the movie holds up throughout.  The pacing is quick and the viewer needs to give each scene total attention as the threads of evidence and relationships are tightly and well woven.<br /><br />Kim Basinger is fantastic as the Veronica Lake look-alike prostitute.  She knows how to deliver and it gives the film a integrity that is hard to replicate.<br /><br />All the actors do a top notch job - Basinger, Crowe, Cromwell, DeVito, Strathairn, Spacey, Crowe and Pearce.<br /><br />A standing ovation for the perfect screen version masterpiece mystery!</p></body></html>

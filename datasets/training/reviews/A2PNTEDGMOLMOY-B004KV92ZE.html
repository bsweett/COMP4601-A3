<meta name="summary" content="Jack Back finds his animal doppelganger with Po the Panda"></head><body><p>"Kung Fu Panda" is one of the more pleasant surprises to come out of the Hollywood animated film machine these days.  While the Pixar movies are virtual locks for greatness, the rest of the genre has become rather tired, with big name stars lining up for movies designed for max box office appeal rather than great storytelling.<br /><br />So the non-Pixar test these days is, are we watching something more akin to "Shrek," or closer to "Shrek the Third"?<br /><br />"KFP" is, thank goodness, right up there with "Shrek" in the pantheon of enjoyable animated films not produced by Pixar.  Jack Black is the perfect choice to play Po, the panda seemingly consigned by fate and fat to sell noodles the rest of his life.  But Po's destiny is to be something else- the Dragon Warrior, who shall bring peace to all.<br /><br />Black's comedic timing is on display as he gets virtually all the great lines in this movie, although Dustin Hoffman does yeoman's work as his kung fu mentor, Master Shifu.  This movie essentially wastes other big names who were cast for no apparent reason, as they lend very little to the story:  Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogan, Lucy Liu, David Cross and Jackie Chan lend their voices to the Furious Five (a collection of kung fu warriors), but none of these fine actors does anything significant.  Ian MacShane plays the villain as only he can, but in large part this is Black's and Hoffman's show.<br /><br />Very family friendly, with more than a few "fat jokes" thrown in (but these are more funny than caustic).  Excellent animation and solid storytelling throughout - this is a very good family film.</p></body></html>

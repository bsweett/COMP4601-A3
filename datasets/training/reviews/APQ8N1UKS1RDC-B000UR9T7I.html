<meta name="summary" content="CAN EVERY BODY SEE THAT IT'S ME?"></head><body><p>This movie is SAD! I mean first off Tobey gets a extension on his<br />contract and more $$$ and he looks fat as hell! Did you notice<br />that the camera shows him from the breast up when he does not<br />have his shirt on! Tobey looking a lil chunkie, not taking the role<br />serious enough, thank god for CGI though Spider Man looks very fit.<br />Now lets get with the villans. With the exception of Sandman the<br />badguys are suppose to wear mask's am I right? I think so. So than<br />why is it that we get the Goblin wearing his god awful paintball mask<br />for Oh 2min and Venom for 30 sec. It seems to me Sam Raimi got hell<br />from the actors of BUT THE PUBLIC WONT GET TO SEE MY FAAACCEE.I mean<br />really people while watching it you can see the actors thinking Can<br />they see me? My public must be able to see my FACE!!! Even spiderman<br />has a long battle without his mask??? And I will not start on Mary<br />jane watson(Sorry Kresten I feel you are a good actress just so miscast<br />as MARY JANE you look nothing like her. But you seem to have stoled the<br />movie. I mean could she have had anymore screen time??? The title<br />should be called SPIDER-MAN 3 The Mary Jane Story! Any way if you<br />love this movie than you love Police Academy 11 for this is Dribble<br />and I gave it 2 stars for I love Sam the man Raimi and of course SPIDEY<br />but this could have been better MUCH BETTER! I wish Sam could have made<br />Spider-Man in 1991 with C. Thomas Howell from the Hitcher and The<br />Outsiders. NOW THATS PETER PARKER! Can everybody see it's me? Can<br />everybody see my FAAACCCEEE?????????? Hi I'm looking for a Tobey<br />Maguire I have his footlong sub woof sandwich with triple cheese.<br />Looking fat there Tobey, not taking the role serious enough.<br />You are so lucky C. Thomas Howell is too old for the role.</p></body></html>

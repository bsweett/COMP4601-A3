Viggo plays Nikolai well and the character is interesting. The character is a lost soul, but with a purpose. He does not for a second doubt his path, but he does have small regrets. The violence is intense and comes in small spurts so it is very effective. The movie develops the characters well and the plot is very tight. There is very little wasted effort. Every character has a side to him that you don't expect when the character is first introduced. Every scene unfolds the story. Because of the violence and because the viewer often knows something very bad is going to happen to certain characters, the suspense is kept at a fairly high throughout the movie. The humor is very low key and it comes through Viggo's character. How the russian mob works and it's philosophy was interesting. The story about the tatoos was fascinating as well. The Russian mobster's tatoos reveal his life.<br /><br />My only minor complaint is that the russian accents are a bit hard to understand at times.<br /><br />In summary, if you can tolerate Viggo fighting totally nude and some gruesome violence, the movie is very entertaining.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="THE ROAD TO OBLIVION"></head><body><p>Dark, moody and tragic, ROAD TO PERDITION is a masterfully made and engrossing film.  Its most powerful scene is when Tom Hanks as the hitman Michael Sullivan takes out Paul Newman's hitmen on a raindrenched street; there is no dialogue, no accompanying soundtrack, just slowmotion of the shootings and the knowledge Newman has of what lies in store. It's ultimately chilling and fascinating in its execution.<br />Tyler Hoechlin shines as Michael's young son who witnesses his father at work in the execution of a member of Newman's brood.  Ciaran Hinds (so good in &quot;Veronica Guerin&quot; and &quot;Sum of all Fears&quot;) is the victim; the killer is Newman's spoiled son, played well by Daniel Craig.  When Craig has Hanks' wife and youngest son murdered, this tale of vengeance spins into its ultimately tragic denouement.<br />Jude Law is frighteningly chilling in his portrayal of a photographer who loves to photograph the dead, and is hired to take out Hanks.  Stanley Tucci is superb as Frank Nitti, Al Capone's henchman.<br />Tom Hanks is excellent, too, as a father who hasn't taken the time to know his son, and whose life of killing catches up with him.  Watching him grow in his love for his son makes for some emotionally devastating scenes, and the ending is powerful.<br />ROAD TO PERDITION is first-class film making, beautifully filmed and scored.  I found it to be very moving.</p></body></html>

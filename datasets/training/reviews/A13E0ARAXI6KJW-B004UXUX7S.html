<meta name="summary" content="Family Angst and Mid-Life Crises in Paradise Anchored by Clooney's Sterling Work"></head><body><p>There's a great line in this 2011 dramedy spoken in a voiceover by the protagonist: "Give your children enough money to do something but not so much that they do nothing." I'm not sure if that came from author Kaui Hart Hemmings' source novel or from director/co-screenwriter Alexander Payne's pen. Regardless, it's hard to believe Payne hasn't directed a full-length feature since the acclaimed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007TKOAA">Sideways</a> in 2004, as this 2011 dramedy most definitely bears his signature approach in focusing on a core set of flawed characters with a deft seriocomic hand. Although the movie is not quite at the level of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007TKOAA">Sideways</a> in shaggily mixing humor with pathos, it does boast a strong performance from George Clooney as Matt King, a wealthy O'ahu-based lawyer with Hawaiian blood, who finds himself in the enviable position of being the sole trustee of 25,000 acres of untouched land on Kaua'i. Dictated by state law, he is just about to get his extended family of cousins to reach consensus on selling the land to a native developer when tragedy strikes.<br /><br />Co-written by Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash, the main narrative revolves around a boating accident that puts Matt's wife Elizabeth into a coma. This tragedy highlights the fact that King, a workaholic by nature, has distanced himself from his two daughters, ten-year-old Scottie and 17-year-old Alex. Suddenly, he discovers he needs to step forward and confront Scottie's bullying at school and Alex's rebellious hostility. When it becomes clear to him that Elizabeth will never recover, he tells Alex they need to visit family members to give them an opportunity to say goodbye. The strenuously resistant Alex surprises him by sharing that she caught her mother having an affair before the accident. This starts a family journey that gives way to revelations and confrontations which allow him to acknowledge his own failures and make peace with what the future will bring. On the surface, the story sounds like it will turn into a straight-ahead tearjerker, but thanks to Payne's discretion, the emotions the characters express and the situations they face are far more disheveled than that and consequently more compelling.<br /><br />It's not that Clooney does anything that takes him that far away from his usual screen persona here. Rather, he backseats his trademark coolness to convey a deeper level of vulnerability and confusion as a man unprepared for single parenthood. As Alex, Shailene Woodley gives a terrifically nuanced performance traversing easily between unbridled insolence and supportive nurturing. Amara Miller provides the right level of precocious honesty in her moments as Scottie. The rest of the cast makes less of an impression, for instance, Robert Forster as Matt's highly coiled father-in-law and Judy Greer as the unsuspecting wife of the realtor who had the affair with Elizabeth. The one fly in the ointment is Nick Krause, who appears to serve purely as a comic plot device as Alex's stoner-dude pal Sid. This character is the one major misstep in Payne's treatment. On the upside, cinematographer Phedon Papamichael captures the Hawaiian locations with greater variety than you would expect, and the soundtrack uses purely Hawaiian music to great effect. This is worthwhile viewing mostly for Clooney's work.</p></body></html>

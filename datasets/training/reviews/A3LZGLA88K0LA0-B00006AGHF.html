<meta name="summary" content="THE RIGHT THING TO DO"></head><body><p>Ben Affleck as Gavin is introduced by giving a eulogized speech on a recently deceased millionaire who has donated money to charities in great amounts.  Affleck is an attorney who is facing charges that the will stipulating that his law firm handle this charitable donation is not valid.<br />Samuel L. Jackson is Doyle Gipson, an alcoholic attending AA classes shephereded by William Hurt.  He is also in a brutal custody battle for his two children, and has applied for a loan to buy a house to keep his wife from taking his boys to Oregon.<br />Both men are on their way to the courthouse when inattention on both drivers' parts results in a fender-bender.  Affleck offers a blank check to Jackson for the damages, but Jackson wants to do it the right way, refusing the check.  Affleck blows him off as he must get to the courtroom to present his documentation.  He leaves Jackson stranded, along with the document of assignment that he dropped out of his briefcase.  Jackson finds the document and takes off with it to court.  Ironically, both men were going to the same courthouse and had Affleck offered Jackson a ride, fate would have turned out differently.<br />From this point on, it is a desperate game of payback and lies as Affleck tries to get the document back.  He arranges for a computer geek to &quot;bankrupt&quot; Jackson and Jackson loses everything; it also appears that Affleck may lose it all, too.<br />CHANGING LANES is a dark, yet ultimately, rewarding experience. Jackson plays against type; Ben Affleck shows a lot of maturity in his performance, and they have a strong supporting cast in Richard Jenkins, Sydney Pollack and Toni Collette.<br />CHANGING LANES shows how a quick, irresponsible action can make a drastic change in one's life.<br />Compelling and well done.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Too much of a good thing"></head><body><p>I first saw Star Wars on HBO when I was 5 years old.  I then bought it on VHS, and rented the DVD's when they came out.  The first couple of times I saw the movie, I was amazed and astounded each time.  But after watching the updated version at the theaters and now on DVD, the movie has lost some of its magic and shine.  Here is why.<br /><br />First, of all the re-releases, Lucas tweaked A New Hope the most.  Some scenes were added that should have been left out.  The scene with Jabba in the hangar on Tatooine is a good case in point.  Jappa looks way too small, and not quite as brown as he looks in Return of the Jedi.  Also, one of the great things about the original trilogy is the fact that each character has minimal introduction before they appear on screen.  We expected Yoda to be a tall and majestic warrior when Obi-Wan first tells Luke about it, not a midget with long ears.  Likewise, Jabba and his court made a great introduction for Return of the Jedi.  Now that is all spoiled by his appearance in A New Hope.<br /><br />Second, the special effects of the original A New Hope actually was the most realistic.  They were subtle and helped the movie, but did not carry it.  The special effects of the revised version looked a little too shiny in some places, and somewhat detracts from the supposed "feel" of the Star Wars world; used and rusty.<br /><br />Third, there were some parts of the movie that could have been expanded on to make the storyline more believable, but were not.  My example of this is at the end when the X-wing fighters take on the Death Star.  A space station of that size would surely have hundreds of tie fighters that it could launch into space.  The movie shows about two dozen.  One of the attractions of this movie when it first came out was the space shoot-out scenes, and the last one in this movie could have been greatly improved upon.  Also, why didn't the X-wings try attacking the big planet-destroying gun on the Death Star.  It was clearly visible as a big dish on the surface of the Death Star, and the strafing runs by the X-wings proved the Death Star did not have any energy shielding device.  Why not damage the gun first to buy them some time, and then try and destroy the battle station.<br /><br />Last, with the release of Episodes I, II, and III, Lucas should have used the opportunity to make the storylines of all six movies flow together better.  Specifically, why does Vader sense the force in Luke but not in Leia, especially given the fact that he is in closer proximity to Leia than to Luke.  Or does Vader's force sense become stronger in battle?  Not sure, but would have liked to know.<br /><br />Overall, this re-release was not worth it for me.  Stuff was added that should not have been, and stuff that should have been added were not.  If you've already bought one copy of A New Hope, I would not bother with this one.  If not, then this would be a good buy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Pardon the pun, but this is a hack job."></head><body><p>Silly, by-the-numbers slasher flick concerning a bunch of teen counselors who are pursued by a crazed killer at camp Crystal Lake. Lots of gore and a high body count, but not an ounce of suspense or tension. It also spawned countless sequels that aren't much better than this mess. This DVD gets an extra star for its camp value and because it evokes memories of those glorious 1980s. Otherwise, this hack job (no pun intended) is totally negligible.</p></body></html>

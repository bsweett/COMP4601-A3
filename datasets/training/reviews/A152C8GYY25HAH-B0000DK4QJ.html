<meta name="summary" content="One of Spielberg's best sci-fi efforts"></head><body><p>"Minority Report" is Steven Spielberg's second foray into Sci-fi in a row, following last year's "A.I." The famed director made his mark in this genre with "ET" and "Close Encounters of the Third Kind". Today we have a more mature Spielberg, albeit one still obsessed with gadgets. The themes are darker, more complex, more ambiguous. The wonder the younger, rather naive Spielberg held for technology has turned to suspicion. The earlier films were more accessible and certainly drew larger audiences, but his current work does more to cement his reputation as a master filmmaker, as well as a master of the technology he now cautions us about.<p>"Minority Report" takes place half a century from now. A genetic experiment has created 'precogs', a small group of people who can see a murder before it happens. Computers can read their thoughts, and by using these, the government has been able to establish its Pre Crime division. In Washington DC, the murder rate has fallen to virtually zero, and there is a big push to use this program nationwide. Pre Crime's chief detective, John Anderton [Tom Cruise] believes the 'precogs' are infallible until the day they give his name as the soon-to-be murderer of a man he's never heard of. What ensues is a thrilling story of a man on the run who is caught up in a web of mystery and deception.<p>There are some flaws in the movie. These include a couple of rather large plot holes, some improbable escapes, and the tendency to have the computer generated special effects make the hero jump higher and fall further than is humanly possible. What a master like Spielberg is able to do it to succeed despite the problems inherent in a project. He is able to add layers which distract, intrigue and challenge us. He can take a present day phenomenon, such as the explosion in media technology, and imagine where it might take us in the future. He can take an ordinary, familiar action hero type and make him memorable. He can make us think while also entertaining us.</p></body></html>

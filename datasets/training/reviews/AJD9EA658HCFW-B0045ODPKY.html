<meta name="summary" content="Angelina shines"></head><body><p>"Salt" is a film that was bashed by film critics, because it's an action film. Once again however, this action film is not as bad as the critics say it is.<br /><br />The basic plot for "Salt" is focused on character Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) who is a CIA agent. One day while interrogating a Russian defector, he tells her that a person by the name of Salt is going to assassinate the Russian president. In hearing this, the CIA decides to keep Salt in the interrogation room, to ask her some questions. She decides to run away which begs the question, is she a spy?<br /><br />Angelina Jolie is the kind of actor where if she has a good script to follow like "Changeling" directed by Clint Eastwood, she is very good. "Salt" has a good plot, in which Angelina shines.</p></body></html>

It's a black comedy at heart, with an eye cast to the implications of paternity and an increasingly weird series of long-extinguished romances, but there's no joy in Murray's role as the dry, lonely playboy on a mission. The ever-changing cast, whose major players never last long enough to settle down and get comfortable, makes it an act with several faces but no identity. Worth a few awkward snickers at its most daring, on the large it's terribly bleak and morose, and ultimately runs kicking and screaming from the answers to its one major question.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="MARVELous"></head><body><p>This is a comic book brought to life.  This means that you must set aside your rational understanding of physics and science and just relax and enjoy what is a marvelous adventure. Everyone knows that Robert Downey Jr. has some serious character flaws but if there was ever any doubt regarding his acting ability this film should put that to rest. There is no doubt but that Downey is one of the best actors around today -- maybe even the best.  This screenplay in the hands of less capable actors could have been campy or dull but Bridges, Downey, and Paltrow turn it into a really excellent film.  In fact the acting is so good thoroughout that Paltrow's performance is easily overlooked but she is marvelous at showing her love for Downey while he is totally oblivious to her or to his unrecognized love for her.<br /><br />To some this may appear to be an anti-war film or a film with some sort of moral message and maybe they are right -- I really don't know all I know is that this was a really enjoyable film and Downey's performance made it all worth while.<br /><br />I did stay through the seemingly endless credits to see the 30 sec tag scene that foreshadows the sequel.  All I can say in the way of a hint is "what happened to the reconstructed prototype suit?"<br /><br />I gave this film 5 stars and I thought it deserved everyone of them.</p></body></html>

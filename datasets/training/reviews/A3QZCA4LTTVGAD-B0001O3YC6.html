<meta name="summary" content="A solid sci-fi/horror flick"></head><body><p>&quot;Pitch Black,&quot; about a stranded group of space travelers threatened by voracious alien monsters, is an entertaining thriller. True, it's not the most original film: elements of this story are reminiscent of such past films as &quot;Aliens.&quot; But solid direction, performances, and special effects make this an above-average film of its genre. The ominous, threatening atmosphere is greatly enhanced by some outstanding cinematography. And Vin Diesel delivers a memorable performance as a criminal who is stranded with the rest. If you like sci-fi thrillers, I recommend &quot;Pitch Black.&quot;</p></body></html>

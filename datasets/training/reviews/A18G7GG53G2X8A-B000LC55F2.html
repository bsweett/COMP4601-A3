Much like a real magic show, it's filled with enough twists and turns to render even the most astute observer completely powerless. It's almost as if the film is daring the audience to guess the outcome, knowing full well that they won't even come close. It's manipulation to the extreme, and it makes the film's main question, "Are you watching closely?" all the more absorbing. How interesting that I allowed myself to fall for such trickery, especially since I usually don't like to be tricked. I can't recall the last time I enjoyed being this manipulated by a story; even the well-crafted "The Illusionist" didn't lure me in as deeply.<br /><br />Maybe that's because "The Prestige" takes the illusory aspects one step further, first by telling the story out of sequence, second by including an intense rivalry. Taking place in London between the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the plot concerns two magicians: the sly Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and the consumed American Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman). They follow a three-act formula used by all magicians. As described by the illusion technician Cutter (Michael Caine), they are as follows: act one is The Pledge, in which a magician displays an everyday object; act two is The Turn, in which that everyday object is made to do something extraordinary, such as disappear; and act three is The Prestige, in which the object reappears, dazzling an audience too afraid to applaud at the end of act two.<br /><br />The problem is that they follow this formula even when they're offstage, with one relying on his showmanship skills to outdo the other. As the film progresses, their antics get increasingly ugly, especially in Angier's case. How did such hostility come into being? It directly relates to Angier's wife, Julia (Piper Perabo), who died as the result of a failed magic trick. Both Angier and Borden were initially employed as audience plants for a magic show, one that included Julia as the magician's assistant. The finale involved her being dropped into a locked water tank with her wrists and ankles tied. The tank was then covered for a short length of time. When the illusion was working successfully, she could slip out of the ropes and free herself. For the audience's perspective, it looked as if she magically transported out of the tank.<br /><br />Her safety depended on the rope itself; in order to escape, a special knot had to be tied, one that would allow for easy loosening. After a while, Borden found that tying the same knot was too predictable; he wanted to tie a knot that looked more complex, as if to say to the crowd that she wouldn't be able to escape as easily. Only he and Julia thought the idea was worth a try, and because of that, we don't know for sure whether or not it was actually attempted. All we do know is that one night something went horribly wrong, and ultimately, Julia drowned in the tank. Even Cutter--who always waited offstage with an axe in case of such an emergency--was too late to save her (too bad CPR didn't exist in those days; there might have been a chance for her).<br /><br />After the accident, the two men go their separate ways and star in their own magic shows. But for Angier, this doesn't mean that he's gotten over the whole mess; from his point of view, Borden is directly responsible for Julia's death. What's worse, Borden has a wife named Sarah (Rebecca Hall) and a daughter named Jess (Samantha Mahurin). Why does he deserve the family that Angier will never have? This ignites a vindictiveness Angier had never known before, a seething, white-hot vindictiveness that drives him into obsession. He's determined to ruin Borden's reputation, first by discovering the secrets to his greatest illusions, then by making them better. The trouble is that Borden refuses to give any of his secrets away; being a magician, he's committed to preserving the mysterious nature of an illusion. This goes double for The Prestige, which is always the most impressive act of a magic show.<br /><br />A series of payback attempts are set into motion, most of which involve one man disguising as a spectator and volunteering during the other man's show. Several tricks are ruined, some people get hurt, and everyone comes away feeling humiliated. Cutter involves himself purely as an effects wizard and manager, rigging Angier up with the latest and greatest magic-making gizmos. But when he appoints a new assistant for Angier--Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson)--the stakes are raised even higher. After an initially harmonious relationship, Angier shows his true nature by ordering her to become Borden's assistant; hopefully, earning the enemy's trust will give her access to valuable information. But it soon becomes clear that she has her own agenda, specifically when it comes to her affair with Borden.<br /><br />And this brings to light a fairly intricate subplot. While Sarah has yet to discover the truth of her husband's infidelity, she's known right from the start that he often behaves differently, despite his constant professions of love. "There are days when you mean it," she says, insinuating that on other days, he's more in love with his magic tricks. It seems that with Borden, it's one evasion after another, with any attempt at personal discussion met with silence and vagueness. "Secrets are my life," he says simply; it's a line that initially seems forgettable but ultimately takes on a wealth of significance. By the end of the film, the audience will come to understand just how important this subplot is.<br /><br />They will also come to understand how deep a hole Angier is digging himself into. He's become aware a new illusion called The Transported Man; the magician enters a door on one side of the stage and immediately exits through another door on the other side of the stage. Borden has been praised for performing this trick, and because of that, Angier just has to learn the secret. And it seems as if he will; Because of Olivia, he now has possession of Borden's coded diary, one that can only be deciphered with a specific keyword (incidentally, Angier is also keeping a diary). This keyword leads Angier back to America, specifically to Colorado. In a remote mountain area, he meets the reclusive Nikola Tesla (David Bowie) and his assistant, Alley (Andy Serkis), both of whom are working on a top-secret electric device.<br /><br />This device may be the key to upstaging Borden and his Transported Man trick. I'm afraid I can't say how. I'm also afraid I can't say what the device actually does. I can say this: watching it work is both awesome and frightening. A central metal sphere shoots lightening bolts in all directions, all of which gain in intensity when an object is placed in the machine's center. It's both respected and feared, like all new inventions are. But the role it ultimately plays is too important for me to describe, especially since it's part of a trial subplot that's woven throughout the film.<br /><br />How does it all come together? What of Angier, Borden, and Cutter? I shouldn't even be hinting at these questions, for I fear that I've already said too much. Like a live magic show, "The Prestige" depends on secrecy in order to be completely effective. It also depends on your willingness to be fooled; many times I thought I had things figured out, and many times I was proven wrong. Almost every plot point in this film is turned on its head, and they go in directions I never expected them to go in. Maybe the loose structure is partially responsible; if the story does in fact follow the magician's three-act formula, then each act is probably not where it should be. The Prestige may be at the beginning. Then again, it may not be. Are you watching closely?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Whatever you think of the movie, this is a nice DVD edition"></head><body><p>We have gotten to the point with DVDs where we really need to be able to rating both the film AND the packaging (similar to what we get to do with the THREE rating categories for toys), because whatever you might think about &quot;Hannibal&quot; as a film this is an excellent 2-disc DVD package.  Director Ridley Scott's commentary is first rate, although there are more lengthy pauses in the last act of the film (and I cannot get the subtitles to work during the commentary, which is how I prefer to do it).  The best of the extras is probably the bit on the Fish Market shootout that allows you to look simultaneously at the multi-camera angles used to film the scenes.  The &quot;making of&quot; featurette is okay, the cast bios above average, and the dozens of discarded examples of posters for the film are fascinating.  <p>I think we are all pretty much in agreement that the shortcomings with the film version of &quot;Hannibal&quot; are inherent in Thomas Harris's novel.  The main problem is that when Hannibal is &quot;out&quot; he is simply not as powerful a figure.  The potency of the character in &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; is that even when he was thrown in a dungeon cell or masked and harnessed to a dolly he was still in psychological control of the situation.  The idea of Hannibal getting Meigs to swallow his tongue was more horrific than what happened to Pazzi or Krendler in this film.  I am sure the ending of the film has to be more satisfying to fans than that of the novel, although I do want to point out that in the book Lecter used drugs and psychological conditioning to reprogram Clarice into not his lover but rather his consort, which is closer to Frankenstein than Pygmalion. <p>Watching &quot;Hannibal&quot; on DVD confirmed the two strengths I found in the film when I first saw it in the theater.  First, screenwriters David Mamet and Steven Zaillian did a marvelous job of concocting scenes between Hannibal and Clarice.  In the novel the two are never together until the very end, while in the screenplay we have Clarice listening to tapes of their previous conversations and talking on the telephone in a couple of interesting situations.  Without these creative additions &quot;Hannibal&quot; becomes just like &quot;Sleepless in Seattle.&quot;  Second, the best performance in the film is turned in by Julianne Moore.  We have no trouble believing this is Clarice Starling ten years down the road.  Of course this is particularly impressive since the actress is following in the footsteps of Jodie Foster's Oscar winning performance.  I even think you can clearly see echoes of Foster's original characterization in Moore's work.  As for Anthony Hopkins, he is certainly presenting a different, more mellow side to Hannibal, which I suppose is justified by the intervening years.  Still, as the ending amply proves, this is not the same old Hannibal Lecter.  <p>Anyhow, whether you have already seen &quot;Hannibal&quot; or not, as long as you have seen &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; you should check out the DVD version and make up your mind about all these nonsense.  You have to admit the author and the film give you plenty to think about.</p></body></html>

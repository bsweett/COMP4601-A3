It stars Scout Taylour Compton as Laurie Strode Malcom McDowell as Dr. Loomis Sheri Moon Zombie is in this for the sake of being Rob's wife Daeg Fearch plays young Michael Myers Tyler Mane plays adult Michael Myers Danielle Harris make plays Annie Brad Douriff plays Lee Brackett. The story is young Michael Myers grows up in your cliche Rob Zombie white trash family who is abused by his step father & you get the F  in every sentence don't tell me I use language cause this is Rob Zombie writing this & he is a terrible writer he can't make good dialog. We learn Michael likes to kill animals I hear "Oh it's realism" those kinds of plots have been done over & over. They work for The Hannibal films not Halloween. So no it's not original it's cliche. Ok Michael is bullied at school Michael kills him in the woods he moves on to his sister & step father & becuse his sister won't take him trick or treating & you get love hurts a scene that I laughed at it is corny. I know it's Rob Zombie's Halloween but G*d D**n Michael isn't suppose to be a tragic character. He's doing it to protect his younger sister. By this point the mystery is gone we get pointless sessions between Michael Myers & Loomis then there's this scene that made me laugh Dr. Loomis & Michael's Mom leave the room & this Nurse looks at a picture & says "Pretty baby couldn't be related to you." she turns her back & you might as well as had a sign that said victim. Michael goes from average sized kid to almost 7 foot. Michael's escape is so retarted in the unrated version & this was suppose to be "realistic." Were introduced to Laurie Strode & her annoying friends Scout Taylor Compton has the acting ability of a porn star. After that we get a shorter poorer made version of the original. Michael is like Jason & not like The Shape  Tyler Mane has 2 maybe 3 ok scenes but he'd be a better Jason. Like I said stand alone movie it's maybe half way watchable but since Rob wanted the money he went & remade Halloween. Just becuse Michael is HUGH it's got a lot of blood I can watch Halloween II the good 1 & it's a lot better. If written right anybody can play Michael Myers but Rob Zombie can't write. & no this is not better than JC Halloween. I'd rather watch Halloween Resurrection it knew what it wanted to be it was ment to be funny this was trying to be serious & came off as laughable.</p></body></html>

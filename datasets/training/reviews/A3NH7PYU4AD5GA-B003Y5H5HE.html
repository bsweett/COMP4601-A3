<meta name="summary" content="Some more on Paris"></head><body><p>If I get a vote in this year's Oscar, I will vote for either of the two Paris films that are nominated. Either Midnight in Paris by Woody Allen, or this charming kids story about an orphan boy living in a Paris railway station attending to it's clocks. He encounters a gruff toy shop owner who turns out to be a forgotten master of the movie industry. Beautiful work by Scorsese with a good cast. Special mention is earned by Sasha Baron Cohen as station cop with a lame leg, a doberman, and a soft spot for the flower sales girl.<br />P.S. The awards are out now. Hugo collected 5 minor oscars, better than nothing. I can't say that the winner didn't deserve to win, but I will keep rooting for Hugo. There is a lot more to be said for the film than I have done here.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Will go down as a classic"></head><body><p>But not because it is a great script.  It's not really.  An amusement park ride from hell-is all that's on paper.  What will make this a Classic is the ground-breaking Computer graphic animation.  When I first saw this film in the theater, I was completely blown away.  Some think that this particular art as been approved upon--I don't hold that same opinion.  I see too many movies where you can tell what is real and what is fake.  This movie--everything looks REAL and for this film-there lies the horror.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

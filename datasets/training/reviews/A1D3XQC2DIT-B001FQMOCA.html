Before it was released in theaters, I knew almost nothing at all. I had heard some of his songs and was more than familiar with his name, but I had no concept of the impact he had on music and on so many lives.<br /><br />The movie touches briefly on Johnny Cash's childhood, enough to paint the picture of a few events and relationships that would shape his life forever. The film next follows Johnny on tour, at the beginning of his career, as he played shows with Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, and a young Miss June Carter. They travel from city to city delighting audiences, playing shows, having a good time, and for some of them, maybe even falling in love.<br /><br />Johnny Cash had more talent than he knew what to do with. But he also had skeletons in his closet and without June Carter, his story would have been one of what could have been, rather than what actually was, one of the greatest careers music has produced. June Carter, despite being the object of Johhny's affection for many years prior to their marriage, played a very valuable role in his life. Among so many other things, June Carter was Johnny Cash's guardian angel. She saved him from his own demons and inspired him to continue his greatness.<br /><br />Before I even begin to comment on the acting, I need to mention something important. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon did their own "stunt work," if you will. They sang each song featured in the movie. It is truly an impressive thing they did in lending their singing voices and not just their faces to Johnny Cash and June Carter. I have read that Reese Witherspoon was not a very good match vocally to June Carter, but that should not take away from what she did. Joaquin Phoenix's voice was incredible. I thought he did an amazing job sounding like Mr. Cash.<br /><br />From an acting standpoint I feel that there were two breakthrough performances in Walk the Line. I will start with Reese Witherspoon, whose career has been full of light comedies and naive characters. I have not brought myself to watch many of her earlier movies because they do not appeal to me. I hope that is about to change. Your secret is no longer safe, Reese; we now know that you are an impressive presence on screen. She is not just another pretty face, though she certainly is that. Her performance, which earned her an Academy Award, was full of strength and passion. She did humor, drama, and love and she did each one well.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix and I have had many creative differences in the past. Well, I do not know him personally and have never actually met the man, but I refer to the roles he has played. From seeing him as male support during the majority of his career, if you had asked me if I ever thought he could play lead, I would have said no. And I would have been wrong. Joaquin Phoenix played the lead, nay, he owned the lead in Walk the Line. He still showed signs of the actor I have not liked in the past, but managed to still captivate me. Maybe it was his likeness to Johnny Cash's voice as he sang that overshadowed the rest of the performance, but I doubt it. I think he has come a long way. I am sure he has worked very hard to get to where he is now, with one Academy Award nomination under his belt. It has paid off.<br /><br />Walk the Line is a movie with two great performances about two great performers. And I can tell you that you will not be the first to rush out and buy Johnny Cash albums after seeing the movie, or even the soundtrack which features the performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon.<br /><br />For another movie with great vocal performances by the actors see The Commitments.</p></body></html>

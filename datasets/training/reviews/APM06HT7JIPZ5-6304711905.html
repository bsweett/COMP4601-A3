The action/shoot-out scenes are terrific, exciting and very well-staged.  The set design, costumes, sets, and everything else truly takes you back to the old days of the Wild West.  And the acting! WOWWEEE!  Kurt Russell gives the greatest performance of his entire career as the legendary Wyatt Earp; he adds so much depth to the figure with a past/reputation that he would give anything to leave behind, but he knows that he can't.....and to put it in his own words, "And that's the damnable misery of it."  He is both very human and a "wouldn't-hurt-a-fly" kind of guy, but also the baddest dude this side of the Rio Grande!  This is one guy you do not want to piss off!  But Val Kilmer absolutely steals the show as the gamblin' gun-totin' "Doc" Holiday; his mere screen appearence can brighten up the scene.  He has the best lines (except for the one above, which is given to Kurt Russell), and presents them in a way that is bound to make you laugh/cry/do whatever it is that you're meant to do.  Everyone else does great, too.  Love backstories in westerns aren't usually all that great, but the one in here is very well-done.  This is a must-own for any western or action fan!!! 5 STARS!!!!!<br /><br />VISTA SERIES DVD<br /><br />I was really hyped up about this new two-disc set, because I heard it was great.  Well, not that I'm saying it's a bad DVD (FAR FROM IT!), but it fails to live up to its reputation, both in the "all-new, never before seen Director's Cut" and the Extras on Disc 2.<br /><br />First of all, there's hardly any thing added in here!  Four minutes at the most.  In the end, you come off wishing for much more to be added in.  And what makes it even more disappointing, is that if you watch the Theatrical Trailer, you will see TONS of footage not shown in the movie!!  That pissed me and my dad off A LOT!!  But, oh well.  What can ya do?  What is added in is very good.  Every scene adds more character development or drama to the story, as well as make more sense to the plot/story.  And the picture and sound quality is nearly flawless; just some grain here and there, but BARELY!<br /><br />The Extras are nothin' to get excited about.  The 3-part Making-of documentary is very entertaining, but unfortuanately it isn't very long (a little less than half an hour).  It does have great interviews with the cast & crew, and it's very informative.  It makes you realize how much went into making this magnificent western, and you come off respecting the film even more.  Also, the cast members offer little insights on their characters, and those are very interesting!  The "Tombstone Epitaph" is pointless unless you get right up to the screen; otherwise, you can't read a darn thing!  Besides that, there isn't much besides some trailers and story boards (boooorrriiiing!!!), although I have not yet tried the DVD-Rom card game that is featured.  That looks fun!  But, ironically, the best special feature is the really neat case and cover art it comes in!<br /><br />In Conclusion:  This DVD, while not among the best DVD's I own, is a great buy.  The film is presented in a format that is perfect!  Well, nearly.  Poor special features or not, at least it has special features!  The original DVD didn't have diddly.  The Vista Series DVD is a somewhat disappointment.  But, then again, every DVD seems like a somewhat disappointment after owning and viewing the Special Extended DVD Edition of "TLOTR"!  But what the Vista Series is focused on is the actual film, and in that case, it succeeded beautifully.  They sould've either done  A)  Inserted all that footage shown in the trailer, or  B)  Not included the trailer at all!  Then we wouldn't have any complaints and wouldn't know about it at all!<br /><br />Overall, a great DVD to add to your collection.<br /><br />Film:  5 Stars<br /><br />DVD:  4 Stars<br />Overall:  4.5 Stars</p></body></html>

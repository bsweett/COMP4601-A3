Because of several human errors, themselves simple, no one is on board to stop the train, and "dead man's switch" is of no use. As Rosario Dawson's yardmaster says, the worst scenario is "a missile the size of the Chrysler Building." The only hope to evade the catastrophe is a veteran driver Frank Barnes (Denzel Washington) and a newly-hired guard Will Colson (Chris Pine).<br /><br />The story, inspired by the real-life event in 2001 Ohio, is simple, and it works. This is a non-stop ride of action from start to finish. Tony Scott's trademark fast-cut visual style and fast-paced narrative captures the deadly power and speed of the rushing train, greatly supported by the impressive stunt work. To create tension, the film does not rely on CGI effects overused these days. The film shows what it is being "unstoppable."<br /><br />"Unstoppable" is not without flaws. For all the strong acting from the leading actors, characters (especially those who make wrong decisions) tend to be stereotypical. Action set-pieces are gripping, but I for one prefer less hectic camera work.<br /><br />Still this is a hugely entertaining film, plenty of action and speed that goes faster and faster as the film's story unfolds. Highly recommended.<br /><br />(Not to be confused with the 2004 Wesley Snipes film of the same name.)</p></body></html>

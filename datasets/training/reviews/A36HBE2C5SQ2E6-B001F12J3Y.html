<meta name="summary" content="way better than the book. takes us on a journey."></head><body><p>listen before you critize this review. This is a great movie, mainly, because of its breathtaking and mersmerizing animation. it is a techinque that hasn't been done before.Robert Zemckis took a real risk and it payed off because this film is excellent. The only problem I had with this movie was that Tom Hanks did too many voices. They could've branched out and could've had some other actors to do the other voices. \<br /><br />The film is about a boy whose name is not said, is in bed on christmas eve and he rubs off off of us as a non-beliver of Santa. He, all the sudden, feels a rumbling and see lights, and he gets his robe on and goes out to look, it is The Polar Express, with Tom Hanks as The Conductor waiting to take him and a large amount of kids to the North Pole. He goes on the journey to the north pole and along the way He meets a ghost hobo, a boy afraid of christmas, a boy that is a smarty pants, and a girl that becomes his friend for the film and helps him make it through the movie. The movie is literally a roller coster ride, there are so many twist and turns on the way that you feel that you are riding along with them. This movie stays so true to the book, you won't belive it. Most movies base itself on the books! The ending made me tearful to know that Hero Boy now belived in Santa. That got me.<br /><br />Robert has a great movie on his hands. Yet another great collaberation with Tom Hanks, that is full of Christmas cheer, imagination, and fun. Go see this movie a lot, and see it near Christmas time if it is still in movie theathers. I loved it, my mom loved it, and the rest of the family loved it.<br /><br />Go see it right now!</p></body></html>

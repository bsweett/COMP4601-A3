<meta name="summary" content="a southern tale of prj-u-dis"></head><body><p>this was a best seller on paperback by harper lee.it is considered a classic both on paper and in film.theres these 2 kids scout and gem who are growing up in the south long ago.there neighbor was boo radley who was crazy and never came outside.they say he killed someone with scissors.one summer,a black guy was accused of raping this chick.now at this time,blacks werent considered to be any better than in 1870.to make matters worse,there father was a lawyer and got the undesirable job of defending him.this sends the small racist town into an uproar.problem is,the black guy is crippled as one arm is fully one foot or more shorter than the other.but,they were going to hang him anyway.id better stop here before i take it too far!the writers did an excellent job mastering this enchanting tale which is a true classic!if not for the rape element,this would be an excellent show for kids.i think this is one of those rare movies that is likeable by everyone.its good beginning to end also.they should make a new version.the rape victim is the closest thing to pretty here and shes a clueless inbred hick.it is actualy very much consistent with the book,with only very minor differences.the important message is dont drink too much and reason can win over terror if properly applied.the trial is pretty intense and the closing scenes too.a great great great GREAT movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!![just buy it,damn!]</p></body></html>

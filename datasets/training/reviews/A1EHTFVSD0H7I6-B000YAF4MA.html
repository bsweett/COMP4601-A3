<meta name="summary" content="Seeing it Again Won't Make it On My Bucket List"></head><body><p>I should have loved this film. I really like Nicholson and Freeman. I also enjoy a good dramedy, even those about death -- one of my all-time favorites is Better Off Dead. It must be very difficult to pull off funny when the subject is death, so to do so is impressive. The Bucket List tries, and sometimes gets very close... but I didn't love this film. It was okay. I don't regret the time invested, but, I'm not adding it to my library.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />There was a manipulative feel to it, at times too much emotion, and others a lack that seemed extreme even when taking the grieving process into account. And I really didn't like the characters. The actors did a great job with the material. But there were moments where I ended up scratching my head and wondering where the inappropriate emotion was coming from, or how in the world that choice was made. I will admit that I just lost a near dear one to lung cancer and the hospital scenes were tough to watch. But I don't think that affected my feelings about the characters.<br /><br />Freeman plays a hard-working, responsible family man, Carter. He's sacrificed his whole life for his family. Nicholson plays the part of a rich playboy, Edward. Edward owns the hospital where Carter is living during cancer treatment. Edward is diagnosed with cancer and ends up as Carter's roommate because Edward is infamous for publicly stating from his soapbox that "there are no private rooms etc.etc." Predictably, they hate sharing and each other until treatment and struggles bring them together in a brotherhood of the suffering and dying. They begin a bucket list..."things to do before I kick the bucket." Actually, Carter does and the items on the list are evidence of his life of responsibility and service. But then Edward and his deep pockets get involved and the adventure is on.<br /><br />I struggled with Carter's embracing of some of Edward's foolishness. I didn't like Carter's wife which was probably the goal otherwise Carter would have just looked selfish for taking off on the mad adventure around the world. Maybe I've been wrong about things. I always thought that I'd look back and feel that my life made a difference in others' lives because of relationship, not because of my experiences and exploits. Ultimately, that is kind of the end message. But it takes a long, twisted road to get there.</p></body></html>

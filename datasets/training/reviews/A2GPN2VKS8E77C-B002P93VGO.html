<meta name="summary" content="In X-Men, We Knew His Name: Logan Also Known As Wolverine. Now, The Story Begins..."></head><body><p>In "X-Men," we were introduced to a man known only as Logan, aka The Wolverine. Now, the story behind Wolverine is revealed...<br /><br />Hugh Jackman stars in the explosive, action-packed prequel to "X-MEN." Liev Schreiber joins the cast as Victor Creed, Logan's brother with a dark secret. And the fun is just beginning...To say any more would spoil the pleasure. Ryan Reynolds co-stars as Wade Wilson (shame his screen time was so short). Danny Huston (the HBO miniseries "John Adams") also stars as William Stryker, a mysterious figure with ulterior motives. The movie is fun from hair-raising beginning to the exciting bitter end. Rated PG-13, but should have been rated PG.</p></body></html>

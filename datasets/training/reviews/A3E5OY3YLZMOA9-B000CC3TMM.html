The thing that was different about Transporter is the star to me was a surprise and from there I thought the film to probably be bad and was I wrong. Jason Statham nailed the role and made it a better film. The fighting scenes are so realistic you can almost feel the pain. The camera angles fit perfectly letting you see every angle of the car chases and fight scenes to add to the excitement. The story is pretty mediocre with a slight twist but because of Statham's fantastic performance in the first film you really watch this to see him recover what has been taken and destroy the man who took it. This film is not a regular one it's an action film that any action addicted fan must see. They make the film look as realistic as possible and I think it deserves more than 3 stars. Before you watch this get ready to see a movie with a lot of things you've never seen.</p></body></html>

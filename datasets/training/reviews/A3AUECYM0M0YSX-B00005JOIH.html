<meta name="summary" content="A little too cautious"></head><body><p>I wrestled with this one for a while. I should start by saying I have no strong opinions for or against either side here. But that probably won't stop some people from accusing me of bias this way or that. I also don't care if and whether Spielberg took some liberties with history to forge an allegory. Artists have been doing this since the beginning of time. You want a documentary on the events of Munich, go rent a documentary.<br /><br />I moderately enjoyed much of the film, even though I found the second half too long and too plodding. The opening is kinetic, the scenes of how the "gang" is formed is very engaging, and the first couple bombing sequences well done. In one of the most literal applications of a famous director's mantra I've ever seen applied to the screen, Spielberg has a bomb *nearly* go off with an innocent--a little girl--inside the apartment. The fact that it *doesn't* explode, at least right then, is the embodiment of Hitchcock's famous lesson about thrillers: "There's a bomb in the room and it goes off--that is shock; there's a bomb in the room and it doesn't go off--that is suspense."<br /><br />Yet, at the same time, that scene subliminally pricked in me a realization of exactly what is wrong with Munich. Hitch has a similar bomb scene--similar not in terms of plot but technique--in his Saboteur (1942), and here it is more effective. Why? Maybe it's because with Hitch we eat our cake and have it too. His bomb does go off, yet not in the way intended, and the result is even more shocking because of this. Spielberg treats his moment far more literally, and to me it consequently falls flat.<br /><br />And that, I realize more and more, was my biggest problem with Munich. Spielberg is too cautious, too earnest. This movie has that "I-Am-Aware-I-Am-Telling-An-Important-Story" quality to it. It's not a *bad* film, but it's not what it could have been. It's also, to me, not worth 2 hours and 45 minutes. A lot of incidents in the central section could have been cut or combined. There are some brilliant scenes--an assassin on a balcony sharing pleasantries with his victim moments before the kill, a mix-up where the Israeli commandoes and PLO hit men wind up book into the same safe-haven, a trip to a French country estate to meet the once-patriotic and now-disillusioned profiteers of the conflict--but mixed with these are moments that would be too banal to be in any routine caper: too many scenes explaining how bombs are made and planted, too many scenes of the main character wringing his moral hands, an uber-predictable change of heart after his wife gives birth to their child. (In any movie where the main character's wife gives birth while her husband is on a morally-challenging mission, you can bet either he's not coming back alive or he'll come back, but with a change of heart as he stares into the kid's eyes. Since this is a Spielberg movie I knew the former wasn't going to happen.)<br /><br />Maybe if the main character had started out hesitant in his task but had grown into a ruthless killer, or vice versa, or his wife and he were thinking of having a baby and in the end decided not to because of the horror, or decided they must because of the horror, to make a brighter tomorrow. Maybe he could have been an idealist thrown into a group of cold immoral killers and changed his mind through his relationship with his peers. Maybe he could have befriended one of the PLO guys they bumped into in the safe home and seen the other side...in short, anything except the conventional procession of events we got. It was rather pat, pretending to ask profound questions and settling for stock answers.<br /><br />Also, I think Spielberg (and other people, for that matter) are suggesting the cure for the wrong disease. Being reasonable and rational won't work with terrorists. Terrorism by definition is not reasonable and rational, nor do terrorists want to be reasoned with--they'd prefer death. That's their "thing. "  Maybe the film could have dealt with that realization--started the main character where he is at the end of the film--can't we all just get along?--and then had him realize terrorists don't WANT to. Any of these, I feel, would have been a better movie than what we got.<br /><br />But because of the conventional journey we get here, I'm afraid I arrived at the ending before our protagonist did. Not much of a catharsis for me, but rather a feeling of "I knew this is where we were headed--what took you so long?"<br /><br />Transfer to DVD is excellent, as would be expected, since Spiels is in total control. There is a second disk of featurettes on the making of the movie. It's interesting viewing, but not essential--again we get just what we'd expect, with EP Kathleen Kennedy praising her boss to the skies and all the actors talking about what a joy it is to work with Spielberg. The most interesting part was when the Jewish actors discussed how it was both difficult and cathartic to work with the Arab actors playing Palestinians, and how they bonded in real life.  That touched me more than anything in the movie itself.</p></body></html>

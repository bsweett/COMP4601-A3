<meta name="summary" content="Science Fiction Meets the Human Condtion"></head><body><p>This is not an essential Halloween movie, but it is really great. It's a science fiction movie that shows us aspects of the human condition.<br /><br />Elliot (12 or so) is basically an outsider. His older brother and friends are not exactly cruel to him, but they do make him feel like they are doing him a favor by allowing him to participate in their activities. Later, Elliot runs into E.T. Basically, because Elliot is an outsider, he is more receptive to accepting someone else who is an outsider.<br /><br />To make a long story short, Elliot gradually convinces his older brother (Mike) and his younger sister (Gertie) to help get E.T. home. (He was accidentally left behind by his friends.) It is interesting how in their compassion for E.T., the civil disputes between Elliot, Michael, and Gertie seem to disappear.<br /><br />If we want to get really technical, there is a moment in the classroom where we see that Elliot and E.T. have a link. And in science class, Elliot frees all the frogs that were going to be cut up for study. (Later, we will see that this has relevance to the climax.)<br /><br />Moving on, there is the Halloween moment of the show. E.T. hopes to call his people to get him home, and Halloween is the one night where he could easily be mistaken for just a kid trick or treating. But this is when trouble starts.<br /><br />There are other people who are interested in E.T. for possibly less than kind reasons. But this leads to a climactic and comical chase to get E.T. home.<br /><br />Overall it's a great movie science fiction movie that shows us about the acceptance of outsiders.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: I'm one of the few people who felt that the Atari 2600 game "E.T." really wasn't so bad.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="GOOD OLD-STYLE ACTION MOVIE !"></head><body><p>In the better style since Errol FLynn and Harrison Ford, this is first rate adventure movie, with humour, action, suspense and romance!  The cast is inspired (Brendan Frase is the absolute underrated  star, he can play  any role and be convincent). But it's not a movie to watch more than one  time!</p></body></html>

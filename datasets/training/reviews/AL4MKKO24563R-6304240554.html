<meta name="summary" content="A worthy sequel"></head><body><p>I just saw Dawn of the Dead for the first time. I actually saw the remake first, which I liked. And, of course, I've seen the terrifying Night of the Living Dead many, many times and will probably see it again this Halloween. So going in, Dawn of the Dead was a little behind the eight ball, so to speak. But considering the large number of preconceived notions I had regarding the film, I did enjoy it and would recommend it. A con and a pro:<br /><br />CON: I truly believe that the greatest horror films are black and white. Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy, Diabolique, Psycho and, of course, Night of the Living Dead, to me, are masterpieces that just wouldn't be the same if shot in color. The shadows are darker, deeper and more sinister. Danger and menace seem to lurk around every corner. And night seems to fall over the proceedings like a shroud, waiting to swallow up everything. Perhaps it was part of director George Romero's satire of the consumer culture that prompted him to shoot the film in bright colors. However, I kept thinking of the spooky quality of the grainy black and white photography of the first film and Dawn of the Dead suffered a little bit in comparison. The color was especially jarring when blood was shown. Romero wanted a bright, unrealistic quality to the blood -- sort of like a comic book. However, the effect of this is to make the blood look like a spilled raspberry smoothie. The film is very scary, but might have been more so had Romero shot it in black and white.<br /><br />However, Romero wisely stuck to the philosophy of the original when it came to casting. Probably because of budgetary constraints, he cast unknowns from the Pittsburgh area in the film. The remake of Dawn of the Dead released in 2003 was good, but it was a big studio film with recognizable actors like Ving Rhames. When the actors are people the audience knows, there is a separation that takes place. I thought several times during the remake, for example, that there was no way Ving Rhames could be killed off early in the film as he was the most recognizable star (I was right). Part of what made Night of the Living Dead so terrifying was that we didn't know the actors. Anyone could be killed at any time. Nothing was sacred (Johnny gets killed off immediately, Tom and Judy burn to death and become zombie food, Karen dies and kills her mother, etc.). Romero continues this tradition in Dawn of the Dead. We have no history with these actors, so it becomes easier to think of them as their characters. Most of us have no safety net of knowing the actors from previous work, so we have no idea who is going to live and who is going to die. It adds a level to the horror that is missing in the remake.<br /><br />Overall, Dawn of the Dead is a worthy follow-up to Night of the Living Dead. Like most sequels, it doesn't quite match up, but unlike most sequels, the drop-off isn't that much. Romero has jazzed up the formula with satire and dark humor, but he still manages to scare the hell out of the audience.</p></body></html>

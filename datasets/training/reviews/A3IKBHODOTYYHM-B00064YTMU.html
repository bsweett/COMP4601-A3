<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining, but like many other action films"></head><body><p>One of the major problems I have with many action movies is that they seemingly attempt to suspend your logic to the point of insulting your intelligence-it really gets to be like a proverbial slap in the face after awhile. This movie, like many of its predecessors, follows some of the action film clich&eacute;'s: ordinary guy getting involved in an event over his head, somehow protagonist must save girl from danger, big car chases where many red lights are run and luckily no innocent citizens are run over, explosions, sharpshooters that somehow miss easy targets but hit difficult ones, the over-drawn chase and fight scenes, etc. For what it is worth, this is an entertaining film. It certainly held my interest for the most part, but it began to wane as the movie progressed. I found the first half of the movie was far more enjoyable than the latter half, and, as the second half unfolded, and with each new chase and each new murder by Cruise, I found myself rolling my eyes more and more at the preposterousness of it all.<br /><br />For instance, are we actually to believe that sharpshooters from the LAPD and FBI units, as well as security guards are all going to fail to hit Vincent (Cruise's character) in the nightclub?  Equally implausible is the dancing that continues to go on as weapons are drawn, shots are fired, and commands such as "Put your hands in the air" and "This is the FBI" are being screamed at the club. Some liken Tom Cruise to a human, malevolent Terminator in this movie, and in this segment he plays out this machine-like quality to perfection, as he stoically and unemotionally beats down innocent by-standers and, well, calmly shoots innocent by-standers that happen to be anywhere near Max (Jamie Foxx).<br /><br />Perhaps a bigger illusion is the ridiculously implausible ending. I don't want to give too much away, but let's just say it involves a car crash, a woman alone in a building, a chase, and two injured people with guns aboard a subway. It really is a let down when a movie tries to go so far over-the-top at the climax and conclusion, and Mann (director) does so at the point after the taxi crash to the extent where many of the "positives" of the movie are easily forgotten.<br /><br />Still, on a lighter note, an aspect of the movie that is rewarding is the acting in itself. Tom Cruise plays his rare role as a bad guy, a hit man, to perfection, and Jamie Foxx does an equally commendable job playing the easy-going cab driver with bigger goals in life. They seem to know their characters well, and it is Max, Foxx's character that shifts from the early part of the movie to the latter part. However, one problem about Foxx's character that was slightly an annoyance was the occasional muttering and mumbling that made his lines indiscernible.<br /><br />Overall, it was a decent film, but nothing meriting the 5 stars. It is a fun movie and it will be better if you can stretch your imagination and not be bothered by the usual clich&eacute;s in action films.</p></body></html>

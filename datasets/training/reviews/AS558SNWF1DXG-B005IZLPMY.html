"Cap" is "The Rocketeer" completely drained of its essence. The structure is uncertain, the pacing sloppy, the action dull, the logic constantly questionable.<br /><br />This is a movie just going through the motions, but at the same time it feels like a four-hour film trimmed down to two. Motivations are unclear, questions go unanswered, introductions are set up and then never made. For example: Why have The Howling Commandos appear at all if you're not going to identify them as a unit?<br /><br />Probably the biggest missed opportunity is the handling of Steve Rogers, who -- thanks to a super-serum and some "Vita-Ray" exposure -- goes from 96 pound F-4 weakling to a strapping, totally cut uber-soldier. His "before" version is whiny, passive aggressive and seems a bit of a masochist (taking brutal beatings from bullies, diving onto runaway grenades); his "after" version never really seems the least bit disoriented, conflicted or even very excited by his transformation. And most importantly we never learn exactly why Rogers was so gung ho to fight in the first place, even though there are countless opportunities for a quick monologue that might explain his passion.<br /><br />In an effort to seem important, "Captain America" clutters itself with World War II-era iconography, but its "chase-fight-chase-fight-repeat" train of thought comes from a cut-rate videogame.</p></body></html>

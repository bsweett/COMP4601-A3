<meta name="summary" content="Some Solid Performances, But Inconsistencies Abound!!"></head><body><p>I went out and bought this film  on 2-disc DVD over all the<br />hoopla at the Oscars over it, and I must say that it just<br />left me feeling like it was "Just, Okay"!!--That's all!<br />Daniel Day-Lewis does get deep into his roles and is totally believable<br />in his role as the ruthless, scheming, maniacal lead character!<br />The boy who plays his adopted son is great too.<br />But there is much inconsistency and uneveness in the story-telling.<br />The so-called rivalry between Daniel Day-Lewis's character and<br />the bible-thumping young religious zealot boy who stands up<br />to him is not illustrated well..(only a few uneven scenes here<br />and there, which makes me think that some of the better<br />scenes are on the cutting room floor!)<br />Don't get me wrong, there are some great moments too!<br />But in the big scheme...Ehhh, not so much!<br />I agree with one of the reviewers who said that the second disc<br />sucks as far as special features go!</p></body></html>

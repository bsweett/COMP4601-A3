Both `The Sixth Sense' and `Unbreakable' are masterworks of suspense and intellect; smart reimaginings of commonly treaded genres that often breed inferior replicas of previous works.  I really though back in the early aughts that Shyamalan was going to reinvent the common thriller/horror film and make it something unique and inspired.  I also really thought that he was going to win an Oscar shortly after he lost to Sam Mendez back in 1999.  By now though, his swift embrace by the Academy over the surprise hit that was `The Sixth Sense' seems premature and almost foolish.  He's dropped his ball so far I fear that bending over to pick it up may cause him to hit his head and die.<br /><br />`The Happening' is retarded.<br /><br />The mere premise of this film is actually somewhat inspired.  I mean, the idea that the plants, in an effort to protect themselves from the threat of humanity, have adapted to producing a toxin that causes humans to go temporarily insane and then commit suicide is kind of genius.  From the outset, it would feel like Shyamalan is finding his niche again.  Sadly, the buck stops there and the rest of the `ingredients' are so awfully concocted that the film becomes a massive joke.<br /><br />Completely LOL at Wahlberg talking to a plastic plant.<br /><br />The dialog is ridiculous (hotdogs, really), the acting is horrendous (I love you Zooey, but your comedic approach to this material is distracting) and the plot development is too sporadic for its own good.  Seriously, who is going to believe Wahlberg as a teacher?  I mean, it's honestly distracting.  My dreams of Shyamalan regaining his momentum initially garnered back in 1999 have been abolished over the past few years.  I mean, what is wrong with him?  I will say this; he can direct a chilling sequence (that scene in the creepy house with that nut-job old woman was effectively intense) but he can't write to save his life.  He needs to let someone else write his work from now on.</p></body></html>

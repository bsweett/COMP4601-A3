<meta name="summary" content="A Bruce Campbell classic in the making"></head><body><p>Bubba Ho-Tep by Director Don Coscarelli (Phantasm and Beastmaster) is one of those films that has cult favorite placed on it right off the bat. The film sure deserves all the praise it has been getting. I saw the film again on dvd and I have to admit that I liked it even more this second time around.<br /><br /> The film stars Bruce &quot;God&quot; Campbell as a 70 year-old Elvis Presley who is now stuck in an East Texas nursing home. He and an aging black man who thinks he is JFK (just the explanation of why both leads think they are who they are is worth watching the film) must find and destroy a 4,000 year-old cowboy hat and boot wearing Egyptian mummy who has been terrorizing their nursing home.<br /><br /> Bubba Ho-Tep has the low-budget look to it, but its excellence is in its wry, witty dialogue and the sentimentality that comes off the script by Coscarelli off of a Joe Lansdale short story of the same title. This film also has to be Campbell's best work to date --- yes even better than his turn as Ash in the Evil Dead trilogy. His performance as an aging Elvis could've been phoned in and be so hammy and still be ok, but he takes the role seriously with just enough of the King's mannerisms without going into the territory of mocking. Ossie Davis as JFK is also excellent. These two actors hold the film together in-between shots of the mummy where all they do is talk.<br /><br /> For fans of Bruce Campbell, this is a must-see film and for those who just like fine filmmaking then I would suggest they find this film and check it out.</p></body></html>

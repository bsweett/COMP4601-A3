<meta name="summary" content="The devil's bounty hunter"></head><body><p>This is a 2-Disc extended cut version with over 2 hours of special features, in widescreen version at approximately 123 minutes, or a hair over 2 hours.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage plays Johnny, the son of an Evil Keneval type guy.  As a matter of fact, both father and son do the stunt motorcycle jumps for a carney type act.  When young Johnny finds out daddy has severe cancer, he sort of accidentally makes a deal with the devil.  He sells his soul to extend daddy's life. That kind of puts a halt to his future love life with girlfriend Rachel.  The good news is, Johnny gets to stay alive and wait until the devil needs him to perform a special task.  Johnny gets to be the devil's bounty hunter (The Ghost Rider) when the time is right.  He goes after the bad guys and collects their souls for the devil, he also gets to try to hunt down and battle Blackheart (the devil's son) over a list of souls from a long time ago.  This time, Peter Fonda does NOT ride the cycle.  He plays the devil.<br /><br />It's the story about a good guy who makes a mistake trying to help his father and winds up fighting evil.  The story line is good and the computer graphic imaging is outstanding!  They do some awesome effects when Johnny changes into the Ghost Rider, I mean it is some really wild effects with fire and stuff.<br /><br />Disc 1<br />Never before-seen footage-(extended cut)<br />Commentary with producer<br />Commentary with Writer/Director<br />And visual Effects Supervisor<br />Disc 2<br />3 Making of documentaries<br />Featurettes Chroniciling<br />Ghost Rider Comic Book History<br />Animatics<br /><br />I really enjoyed the show and I don't watch a lot of movies anymore.</p></body></html>

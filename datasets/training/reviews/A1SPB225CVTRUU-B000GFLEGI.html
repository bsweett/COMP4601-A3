<meta name="summary" content="It's Zombie Time Again!"></head><body><p>This film didn't quite impress me on a grand scale, because the story and the performances were mediocre. I must give credit for the special effects and makeup team, because this film is visually engrossing and gorey consistently, and it goes beyond the level Dawn of the Dead and 28 Days Later has achieved. Though I find that this film got a bit tiring for me after seeing so many repetitious gun shots at zombies and zombies eating humans. It's not a scary experience, but it's more gruesome. I enjoyed Dawn of the Dead more, because I loved Sarah Polley. With this film, John Leguizamo is more outstanding,  and Dennis Hopper is rather low-key for a villian. Anyways, if you want to see lots of bloody killing and explosions, then this is going satisfy your craving, and it might even lessen your appetite if you were eating during this film.</p></body></html>

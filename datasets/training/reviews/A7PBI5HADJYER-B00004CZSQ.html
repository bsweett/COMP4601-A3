<meta name="summary" content="Stylish and superbly edited, but it's hardly great."></head><body><p>Strange events are occurring at a German dance school and new American student Jessica Harper suspects they have something to do with the teachers. Dario Argento's proclaimed masterpiece leaves me feeling indifferent. Stylish, atmospheric, with a memorable score by Goblin, but ultimately, there's very little story, which becomes a major hindrance when the bloody murders and the suspenseful build-up to them aren't present. Acting's subpar, too, but it seems a bit frivolous to mention that. Only recommended to horror fans seeking a stylish, but not particularly frightening affair.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great Film"></head><body><p>This is definitely one of the most powerful films I've ever seen. The story is basically a remake of a classic foreign film, where a detective is trying to solve a murder case in a small town that never gets dark. After having trouble sleeping for days, the detective soon finds himself caught in a world of confusion and lies. Al Pacino and Robin Williams deliver very captivating performances in this film, so it's no wonder why this film did so well. This film is probably one of the deepest films ever made going over powerful themes like lust or love, justice or injustice, truth or perception that are often questioned throughout the film. And it somehow works, to where the film manages to blur the perception of right or wrong to the point where the audience can't tell the difference. Overall, this is definitely another great film by two of Hollywood's finest actors.</p></body></html>

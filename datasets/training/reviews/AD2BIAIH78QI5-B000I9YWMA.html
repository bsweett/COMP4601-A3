<meta name="summary" content="Return to Whitechapel"></head><body><p>This started as another of my "let me just see whatever is playing today" excursions to the movie theatre. Most of the other movies had started already, and then I saw that "From Hell" hadn't yet; all I could remember about it was that it was a period piece, so off I went.<p>Well! It was a Jack the Ripper movie!<p>Now, I used to be rather interested in that case as a lilGal, having read different accounts of the Whitechapel murders and seen a few Ripper movies. One criticism I do have to make is that as things were going along, I had a strange feeling of deja-vu: uh oh, wasn't this sort of lifted from "Murder by Decree"? Yeah, it was, although no reviewer has commented on that yet. That was when Christopher Plummer's Sherlock Holmes had a go at it, with James Mason as Watson.  <p>This time, a Holmes-like Cockney detective played by Johnny Depp is the master sleuth in charge of things. I liked his portrayal a lot. I also liked seeing old vet Ian Holm as a proper Victorian doctor whom Depp consults about certain "technicalities".<p>There was, however, a most improbable moment when Detective Depp brings the rather outlandishly dressed prostitute Heather Graham to the Royal Portrait Gallery or some such to make the equivalent of an ID from a mug shot, a full-length portrait of "you know who" if you have read enough about this case before. But wouldn't other people have been surprised to see this REALLY shockingly dressed trollop strolling around the museum? Maybe it's just me.<p>Still and all, I got my money's worth this time and enjoyed this version of the most famous unsolved murders of the 19th century.</p></body></html>

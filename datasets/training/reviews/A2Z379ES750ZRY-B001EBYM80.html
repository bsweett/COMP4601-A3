I was surprised when I found out the movie was just over 3 hours long!<p>The Green Mile has a similar tone and rhythm of Shawshank Redemption with a hint of the "Saving Private Ryan-esque" flashback and ofcourse a pinch of the supernatural of Stephen King.  There is even a Forrest Gump/Apollo 13 reunion of Tom Hanks and Gary Sinese!</p></body></html>

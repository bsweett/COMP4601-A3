<meta name="summary" content="Darker than the 1971 movie"></head><body><p>This 2005 movie features Johnny Depp playing Willy Wonka. Weird. A very weird portrayal of Wonka. I think Johnny Depp is one of the great actors out there, but I really didn't care for how he played the role of Wonka. Those sunglasses, the pale skin, the smile, it all makes him resemble Michael Jackson in a way. His personality seems low-key and quiet.  No spunk.  In contrast, Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka in Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory (1971) was much more energetic and enthusiastic.  I realize this 2005 movie follows the book, but I prefer Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka.  Sometimes changing a character's personality in contrast to the book works out for the better.<br /><br />I must say that the blueberry scene in this movie was overdone. It seems that everything was overdone and had lots of CGI.<br /><br />The kids in this movie weren't as memorable as they were in the 1971 movie. Some of them have the really snotty attitude, but not quite reaching the same level as in the 1971 movie.<br /><br />The Oompas weren't nearly as good as they were in the 1971 movie.  The Oompa song from '71 was great.  The songs in this 2005 movie were fair to pretty good at best.  The musical score by Danny Elfman, however, was good.<br /><br />To sum up, it's a pretty good movie, but I still prefer Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory.</p></body></html>

Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall both give excellent character studies of a vanishing breed of men who seem to outlived their usefulness or so they think. This is another one of just a handful of great Westerns where good and bad, black and white cross lines. The pace of this film is slow and methodical but it builds to an outstanding climax full of bravado and emotion. I really loved it.</p></body></html>

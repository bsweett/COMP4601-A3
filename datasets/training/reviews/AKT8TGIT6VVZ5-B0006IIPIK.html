<meta name="summary" content="May Be The Best Cinematic Action Adventure Since "Star Wars""></head><body><p>Unlike some of those who have already submitted reviews here at Amazon.com I have not yet seen the film, but having seen gushing commentary from Harry Knowles, the film and internet geek in charge of the "Ain't It Cool" website, I am starting to believe all the hype, since this film looks to be a spectacular achievement in both CGI and storytelling. It could be the most exciting fast-paced action adventure film since "Star Wars IV: A New Hope" or the original "Raiders of the Lost Ark", and these are apt comparisons, not mere hyperbole, since Kerry Conron's film is also, like "Star Wars" and "Raiders", an homage to the great "B" action adventure flicks from the 1930's with more than a passing nod to Errol Flynn's swashbuckling characters, in the form of the heroic Sky Captain, portayed by Jude Law, and of course to Harrison Ford's Han Solo and Indiana Jones.<br /><br />Set on the eve of World War II in an alternate reality version of the 1930's, "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" chronicles the exploits of daring New York journalist Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) as she uncovers clues and a trail pointing to those responsible for the disappearances of leading scientists worldwide. One of these clues lets her unexpectedly to cross paths with her ex-boyfriend, ace aviator Sky Captain, and together they join forces to solve these disappearances, defeat an army of gigantic robots bent on destroying New York City, and save the world from the evil Dr. Totenkopf. They are aided in their quest by a 1930's versions of William Gibson's cyberspace "console jockeys", Dax Dearborn (Giovanni Ribisi) and they also received asssitance Franky Cook (Angelina Jolie), yet another  former girlfirend of Sk Captain, now stationed as the comamnder of  a Britsh royal air force squadron in Nepal. And yes, judging from the lush style and gripping narrative of this film, it is probably not too much a stretch to make some comparisons of it with the classic cyberpunk film "Blade Runner" too. The film's lush romantic score pays homage to 1930's swashbuckler film scores and the work of film composers such as Korngold and Newman.<br /><br />Without a doubt, I am looking forward to seeing it when it does arrive on the big screen later this week. Kerry Conron's film may stand alongside Peter Jackson's "The Lords of The Rings" cinematic trilogy, as yet another of the great films of this decade so far, and maybe, of all time.</p></body></html>

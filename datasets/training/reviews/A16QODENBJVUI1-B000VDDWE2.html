<meta name="summary" content="Seriously, it is really not all that bad"></head><body><p>THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW has widely been ridiculed as one of the silliest movies of recent years and was the recipient of utterly awful reviews when it was released.  Having heard all of this, I was hardly tempted to watch it for some time.  But recently I was in the mood for a disaster movie, and having recently watched the Val Guest British classic THE DAY THE EARTH CAUGHT FIRE, I was interested in seeing it destroyed by ice as well.  Although this is one of the most thoroughly panned films of recent years by critics, I thought it was, in fact, a very entertaining film.<br /><br />Yes, the plot is silly.  Rather, it is impossible precisely as presented.  I am not an authority on the subject, but I have read that the central scenario is not impossible, but that it would take place over a much longer time frame than seen in the film.  An ecological disaster is not impossible, but it won't occur in a week.<br /><br />The film has a decent cast, but honestly, who cares?  A film like this is not driven by the cast but by the special effects.  The effects found in this film are among the most memorable one will find, with one exception.  The exception is the CGI for the wolves that attack Jake Gyllenhaal and his friends.  They look absurdly artificial and computer generated, which is made worse by the fact that so many other things in the movie look so great.  There is a great deal of silliness:  the ship that floats up Fifth Avenue and comes to a halt in front of the New York Public Library.  It is absolutely impossible to plot a feasible path for a ship to take to reach the library.<br /><br />Still, once one gets past the silliness, the film is unquestionably quite entertaining.  The tornadoes hitting Los Angeles are amazingly well done and fun to watch while one scene after another is a delight to watch.  We all enjoy movies in which the world comes to an end or at least comes to an end as we know it.  As a kid I loved reading J. G. Ballard's novels that imaginatively bring the world to a close in one way or another, whether by wind, drought, or water.<br /><br />Unless you are completely unable to get past an initial absurd premise, I definitely thing most people will enjoy this.  Besides, much has occurred the past two years to make the idea of ecological disaster more plausible.  Numerous books detailing global warming have appeared, an official in the Bush administration has finally acknowledged that global warming is real, there have been numerous fractures in the Religious Right over global warming, and even Pat Robertson has stated that he was wrong on global warming and now acknowledges that it is caused by humans and requires that we dramatically reduce greenhouse emissions.  And Al Gore released his superb documentary.  So while we won't get any ecological disasters precisely as found in this film, it isn't as unthinkable as it used to be.</p></body></html>

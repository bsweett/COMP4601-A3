<meta name="summary" content="Unforgettable"></head><body><p>MYSTIC RIVER is an excellent movie which deserved the ton of praise it received at the time it was released in 2003. The plot centers around the tragedy that unfolds as one of three boyhood friends is abducted by two pedophiles while playing on the street in a tough working class neighborhood in Boston. By the time the three former pals reach adulthood they are no longer friends, but the murder of a daughter of one of the men brings them back in contact with each other. This is definitely not a feel-good film but it is certainly unforgettable.<br /><br />The leading roles are played by Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon and Marcia Gay Harden. The director is Clint Eastwood and the movie is based on a novel by Dennis Lehane.</p></body></html>

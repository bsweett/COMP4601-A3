<meta name="summary" content="Will Smith continues to amaze me (3.5 stars)"></head><body><p>The story begins with one of humanity's greatest hopes seemingly fulfilled. Dr. Alice Krippen (Emma Thompson) has discovered the cure for cancer. This cure is a virus that is a subset of measles. Paraphrasing her words: the virus is a fast car.  Measles is like putting a criminal at the wheel.  What she did was "replace that criminal with a cop."<br /><br />At the time of the announcement, clinical trials had taken place with 10,900 subjects.  All were cancer-free.  Something clearly went very wrong between the clinical trials and the introduction of Krippen Virus (KV) into the population.<br /><br />At the time KV was introduced into the population, there were 6 billion people on earth. The virus killed 90% of those. The remaining 9% became rabid and photophobic, running in hives only at night and killing whatever they came in contact with.<br /><br />Dr. Robert Neville is one of the 1% of the population immune to KV--and survived. At onset, he was a US Army Colonel and virologist living in New York City.<br /><br />Even three years later, Neville hasn't given up.  He takes his motto from his hero, Bob Marley:<br /><br />"The people, who were trying to make this world worse... are not taking a day off. How can I? Light up the darkness."<br /><br />By day, he and his faithful dog, Sam, travel the city looking for other survivors.  He daily broadcasts a message over all AM frequencies, asking anyone alive and uninfected to come to the South Street Seaport at mid-day offering to provide food, shelter and safety.<br /><br />By night, he hides in his heavily fortified home, preparing food and urging Sam to "eat your vegetables." He watches one movie per night, which he takes from a nearby video store--apparently viewing in alphabetical order.  He's now up to "G". In his basement, he's gathered a fully equipped medical laboratory and he's still working on a cure.  He still has hope, although his psyche is beginning to show cracks.<br /><br />Through flashbacks, we see Neville evacuating his wife and daughter from the city and the frantic efforts to prevent the spread of the disease.<br /><br />Probably the best aspect of this film is Will Smith. He does an impressive job of playing a physician keeping lone vigil over the city that was his charge--and holding on to his own waning hope and sanity. Sam the dog is the only character who can upstage him.<br /><br />I also loved the tributes to Bob Marley.  Like Anna (Alice Braga) in the film, so many of our current generation don't know the man's music or his story.  I'm glad to see both revisited in a popular format. And yes--I agree--Marley was one of the greatest musicians ever.<br /><br />What I found impossible to believe was the 'science.' Inconceivable that 10,900 people in the initial clinical trials showed no signs of the rabid KV virus?  Further, if the virus is also contagious to animals, wouldn't the rabidity, etc. have shown up in the animal testing which occurs prior to the human. I realize a good part of movie viewing is the 'suspension of disbelief' but I not only had to 'suspend,' I had to kick everything I know about the drug discovery process right out of my head. I honestly believe they could have come up with something far more plausible than this backstory.<br /><br />There are some warnings here:<br /><br />1.  While the movie ends with hope, you're going to be going through a lot of depressing material to get there.  Don't go if you're looking for a holiday escape 'pick me up film.'  This isn't it.<br />2.  If you are intolerant of suspense, reconsider going.  My husband had to leave the theatre because he just couldn't handle parts of the film.<br />3.  If scientific accuracy is your bag, you are going to hate this film for the reason I stated above (and more).<br />4.  If you are a devotee of the original Richard Matheson book, you may well disapprove of the redux.<br /><br />All that being said, I still enjoyed much of the film. "I am Legend" will be a one-time view for me, but still worth the distraction on a quiet Christmas Eve morning.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Resident Evil: Apocalypse" is great!"></head><body><p>"Resident Evil: Apocalypse" is great! Better than the original, more action, more style. Stylish, superb, and dynamic. This is the second zombie picture this year after "Dawn Of The Dead" (2004) & fourth zombie picture of 2002-2004. Included in that list is "28 Days Later" (2003) & the original "Resident Evil" (2002). It is the third best zombie picture of 2002-2004, behind "28 Days Later" (2003) & "Dawn Of The Dead" (2004). Milla Jovovich returns as Alice, one of the two survivors of Umbrella Corp's elite Special Tactics and Rescue Services (S.T.A.R.S.), send to check something that went wrong in the hive hidden underneath Raccoon City, who is now trying to find a way to escape the city. Jovovich's performance is excellent, an improvement on her original performance for "Resident Evil" (2002). The cast is very promising. Sienna Guillory as Jill Valentine, a rogue member of Umbrella Corp's elite Special Tactics and Rescue Services (S.T.A.R.S.), looking for a way to get out of the city, as well. Oded Fehr as Carlos Olivera, one of three soldiers trapped in the city. Thomas Kretschmann as Major Cain, the commander of the command center in the safe zone and one of the two people responsible for creating Nemesis. Sophie Vavasseur as Angie Ashford, daughter of Dr. Charles Ashford, a doctor whose research was used for biological weaponry, who is missing somewhere in the city. Razaaq Adoti as Peyton Wells, a friend of Jill's and a member of Umbrella Corp's elite Special Tactics and Rescue Services (S.T.A.R.S). Jared Harris as Dr. Ashford, the doctor of whose research was used for biological weaponry and whose daughter is missing somewhere in the city. Mike Epps as L.J., a man whose in the right place at the wrong time. Sandrine Holt as Terri Morales, a reporter lost in the city looking for her big break. Matthew G. Taylor as Nemesis, the second survivor of Alice's elite group, whose real name is Matt Addison, who was transformed into Umbrella Corp's new creation. Zack Ward as Nicholai Sokolov, the second of the three soldiers trapped in the city and Olivera's right-hand man. Iain Glen as Dr. Isaacs, second of the two people responsible for creating Nemesis. This is an excellent zombie pic in between "Dawn Of The Dead" (2004) & "Resident Evil" (2002). The directing by Alexander Witt (who was the cinematographer for "Hollywood Homicide" (2002), whose taking over for Paul W.S. Anderson, who produced and wrote the story and screenplay for this one, is excellent. The story and screenplay by Paul W.S. Anderson (who wrote, produced, & directed the original "Resident Evil" (2002), and who also directed "Mortal Kombat" (1995), "Event Horizon" (1997) & "Soldier" (1998), who recently wrote and directed "Alien Vs. Predator" (2004) is excellent. The music by Jeff Danna (who also did the music to "O" (2001), with additional music by Elia Cmiral (who also did the music for "Ronin" (1998) & "Stigmata" (1999), "Wrong Turn" (2003), "They" (2002) "Bones" (2001) and also orchestrated the score to "Bones" (2001), is excellent. The cinematography by Derek Rogers & Christian Sebaldt is excellent. The film editing by Eddie Hamilton is excellent. Casting by Tina Gerussi (who did the casting for "Chicago" (2002), "Good Will Hunting" (1997) "Dracula 2000" (2000) & Robyn Ray (who did the casting for the original "Resident Evil" (2002), "She's All That" (1999), "Dracula 2000" (2000), & "Searching For Bobby Fischer" (1993) is excellent. The production design by Paul D. Austerberry (who production designed "Exit Wounds" (2001), "The Tuxedo" (2002), recently, "Highwaymen" (2004) & upcoming, "Assault On Precinct 13" (2005) and was also the art director of "X-Men" (2000) & "The Corruptor" (1999) is excellent. The art direction by Nigel Churcher (who was the assistant art director for "Frequency" (2000), second assistant art director, graphics, for "The Virgin Suicides" (1999) & assistant art director for "Bait" (2000) & third assistant art director for "Romeo & Juliet" (1996) & also directed the art for "Driven" (2001), "The Tuxedo" (2002), recently, "Highwaymen" (2004) & upcoming, "Assault On Precinct 13" (2005) is excellent. The set decoration by Steven Essam (who set decorated "Honey" (2003), "Paid In Full" (2002) & the upcoming "Assault On Precinct 13" (2005) is excellent. The costume design by Mary E. McLeod (who costume designed "Porky's" (1982), "Porky's II: The Next Day" (1983), "A Christmas Story" (1983), "3000 Miles To Graceland" (2001) & "Driven" (2001) & Adam Smith, who did the costuming to Nemesis, is excellent. The make-up effects on Nemesis and the rest of the zombies are excellent. A good sequel to its original movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Anti-Hero and Guilty Pleasure from a So-so Action Flick"></head><body><p>In spite of the fact that 'The Punisher' is based on Marvel Comic character, it is nothing like 'Spider-man.'  The hero of 'The Punisher' is no superhero; he has no superpower to rely on during the fighting, and it is his dark background that distingushed him from others.<br /><br />The hero is Frank Castle. an FBI man who wants to retire.  Because of one botched job, however, a son of shady Florida businessman got killed, and his father (John Travolta) and his wife (Laura Harring) vow revenge.  Actually, it is the wife who orders that Frank and his family should be all murdered (and convieniently, they are having a home party.  Don't complain, for the director Jonathan Hensleigh is the writer of 'Die Hard 3'and 'Armageddon').<br /><br />So, Frank, the sole survivor of the carnage, starts to his own vendetta while he gradually comes to know the timid neighbors in his apartment (as is shown in the original comics).  While secretly making his own plans for revenge (and very unusual ones), Frank is attacked by many curious killers; one guy from Memphis plays guitar before his job, and the unique fight with 'The Russian' is one of the highlights of the film.<br /><br />'The Punisher' often suggests violence, but refuses to show it on the screen, so the results might not be satisfactory to some viewers, being too tame, or too nasty.  But the action sequences, which include more bone-crunching sort of fihting than other Marvel comic films, are effectively shot, and Thomas Jane (credited as Tom Jane) has the convincing presence as the anti-hero, partly thanks to his pumped-up torso.<br /><br />As to Travola, he is not as irritating as in 'Swordfish' -- he is not that bad, but still I think he lacks the charisma he had shown in 'Vincent' of 'Pulp Fiction.'  And though Will Patton steals the scene as the assistant of Travolta, the guests are not particularly great, including Roy Scheider, and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos.  And it is painful to see Samantha Mathis doing a very thankless job clearly for paycheck -- she was so good in the early 90s, and what is she doing here?<br /><br />'The Punisher' is just another standard Hollywood action film with no new thing to add to the genre.  Good for killing time, like watching 'Con Air' or the like.</p></body></html>

Director Kevin Macdonald does what only great directors can; he takes you to another place and time and lets you inhabit it.<br /><br />Watching the film I was reminded of Caligula, whose descent into madness bathed Rome in blood and cruelty.  But Caligula was never charming.  The first half of this movie shows a charismatic Idi Amin, larger than life, riding high on the love of his people.  (This was before he slaughtered 300,000 of his countrymen and fed his ex-wives to crocodiles.)  We are swept up into his force of personality just as our protagonist, Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, is swept up in it.  That works, although it must be pointed out that despite a terrific performance by James McAvoy as Garrigan, he is dreadfully miscast.  Despite all that happens to him, he never looks older than 19, which compounds his already maddening innocence.  Next to Amin, Whitaker, he looks 12.<br /><br />Whitaker's performance has been justifiably praised; it's a performance of a lifetime for him.  However, that sleepy eye of his is really getting tiresome, especially when playing a historical figure whose face is well known.  Also, there is a weight to Whitaker's persona that is distracting, one gets the sense that he is so profoundly miserable, nothing could ever make him even slightly happy.  This gloom is highly evident in interviews.  Though he is clearly of the "method" school, this ponderous quality does make it difficult for him to disappear into parts, often he wears them.<br /><br />One quick aside regarding Gillian Anderson who plays Sarah, wife of Dr. David Merritt.  Ever noticed that when Brits venture forth into the most God-forsaken remains of the empire to live on beetles and grubs and do good in a general sort of way for no particular reason, they invariably look like ex-runway models?  Ms. Anderson is breathtaking, and the alleged romantic encounter with Dr. Garrigan, still shaving with a rubber razor, is beyond ludicrous.<br /><br />The film concerns two men, Amin and Garrigan, both losing their souls in parallel.  Garrigan is a clueless twit high on a sense of adventure.  Amin is more duplicitous, and as Garrigan grows foul with corruption, Amin grows horrific in his madness.  The most memorable exchange of the movie comes when Garrigan tells Amin that he is a child, and that is why he is so terrifying.  That's quite true.  On the world stage, Amin was always a joke, a sort of revolting, embarrassing joke that made you ashamed to be a human being.  Director Macdonald took on a hard topic with The Last King Of Scotland, and he truly did it justice.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

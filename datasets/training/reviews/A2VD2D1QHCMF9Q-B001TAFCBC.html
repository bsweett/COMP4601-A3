<meta name="summary" content="Defining Love!"></head><body><p>Despite what one hears in the press, particularly with politicians . . that if I had it to do over I would do the same thing . . . this movie gives us a more legitimate, more honest take on the concept.  Of course, there are things that we would have liked to do differently.  And in addition, what is it that defines love of one another.  What is love, and is it something integral in ones personality . . the love of one other individual . . that can not be erased.  This picture deals with these questions, and with these concepts, in a clever, if non-conventional manner.  There is something very special about true love, and it can not be taken away.  The trimmings may not be neat and pretty, but deep down there is love, or sunshine, and in that one spot in the mind there is something spotless.</p></body></html>

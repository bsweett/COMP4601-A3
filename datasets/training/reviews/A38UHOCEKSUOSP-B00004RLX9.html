The movie was a visual feast (for its time) and was a success at the box office.  But when it came down to it, it lacked a certain punch and was labeled as "just boring and too long".  Plans continued for a sequal, and director Nicholas Meyer was brought on board for Star Trek II:The Wrath of Khan.  He was one of the many who agreed that The Motion Picture was lacking and was boring.  He had a new vision, and created a very different Star Trek movie.  The Wrath of Khan worked off a much smaller budget, but in return, gambled the Trek franchise with a very dark approach and cetainly a strong punch.<br /><br />One of the great things about The Wrath of Khan is that its a story that continues from an early TOS episode titled "Space Seed", where a gentically engineered superhuman from the 1990's named Khan failed in attempt to capture the Enterprise.  He and his men were sent to a planet known as Ceti Alpha V to begin their own desired life.  In the Wrath of Khan, we learn that the planet has nearly been destroyed, and Khan's people barely survived.  Khan blames Captin Kirk for not checking on their progress, and has a heart filled with hatred and revenge for the good Captain.  Certainly, seeing Space Seed will allow this move to make more sense, but honestly I saw this first as a kid and I still loved it.<br /><br />Khan is the main villain and the center of the plot, but there are various subplots in the film that keep the interest at high levels throughout the story.  There is a device known as Genesis that can practically create life onto dead planets.  A controversial matter is the least to worry about, since Khan is interested in obtaining this device - in addition to obtaining the life of Captain Kirk.  There is another subplot of the character development of Kirk.  He is an admiral, and is uncomfortable with the position.  It makes him feel old and worn out.  Kirk is looking for something to give him refeshment again.  Then there's Spock, who claims the good of the many outweighs the good of the one, and folows up on that with action in the film's conclusion that is shocking and moving.<br /><br />Wrath of Khan is different than the Motion Picture in every way possible.  Overall, the film has a dark tone, and that is justified with lighting and camera work.  Even the uniforms and bridge have obtained a more refined look.  There is actually some violence this time, and a creepy scene with critters known as Ceti-Eels driving themselves into human ears.  The Enterprise gets blasted like never before in spectacular space battles throughout the film against the USS Reliant (which Khan and crew have taken over).<br /><br />Just when the franchise was in trouble, a risk was taken with the production of this film, and it was a tremendous success.  Obviously, since another 8 movies have folled (and another one in production today) and another 4 television series.  Wrath of Khan shows a darker side of Trek, yet still keeping the classic feel there in the mix.  And in the end, Khan is arguably one of the finest Star Trek villains ever to hit the screen, with a must see performance by the extremely underrated Ricardo Montalban.<br /><br />This director's cut includes deleted/extended/redone scenes that were not included in the original.  Trek fans will want to makes sure they own a copy of this for the distinct differences.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 5<br />Characters - 5<br />Story - 5<br />Overall - 5</p></body></html>

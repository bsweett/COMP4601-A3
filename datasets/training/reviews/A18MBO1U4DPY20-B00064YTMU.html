<meta name="summary" content="COLLATERAL"></head><body><p>I just read a long review on Amazon by a reviewer who said some pretty intelligent things about Michael Mann's direction.It made for an interestin read really.Sadly,I havent followed his films but he does manage to raise an important point. The Audioslave track does indeed not match the pace of the film and the time it was played.There was substantial few precious seconds devouted to it though.<br /><br />To deny this film from what it deserves would be criminal.I can safely say Tom Cruise proves himself time and again as one of the best actors time has seen.He will be remembered by someone in the 22nd century as a man of great devoution to what he was good at.Jamie Foxx's character on the other hand was what be a mixture of morality and individuality.There wasnt much of a proportion between the two but he turned into a righteous individualist in the film when it mattered.<br /><br />I must add it's not easy to make such precise paced flicks.There's nothing predictable to me.I quite liked the discussion of reality checks between Foxx and Cruise which made one of them go crazy.Also the discussion of Miles Davis in a jazz bar was more interesting than what I can possibly try and comprehend.<br /><br />All in all,this film would go down in my memory lane as one of the best directed action/thriller films I have seen in a long time.It's not easy to make a film about just one night and spread out in a chain of events leading to one another and making it all look terrificly well done.<br /><br />What I disliked about the film was its limited outlook.No,dont get me wrong because even if I try I couldnt find a flaw in the film that would make me stomp my foot hard.It's just that it perfectly fits the four star grade.<br /><br />And oh yes,Tom Cruise's suit fits him like silver skin.He's a bit of a Terminator 2 villain in this film and I'm sure a lot of people would love to watch this side of the man.<br /><br />Jesus,he even buys flowers...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="POWER TOOLS FOR A NEW GENERATION"></head><body><p>For over 29 years horror fans have rallied about a small, low budget film that when released scared the hell out of any viewer brave enough to watch it. Of course I am talking about the original TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. Director Tobe Hooper took the story of ghoul/cannibal/murderer Ed Gein and moved him from Michigan to Texas, adding a family and a few other idiosyncrasies along the way.<br /><br />The movie spawned three sequels and several documentaries on the making of the film. It launched a more graphic approach to horror than had been witnessed before. And it created a now legendary horror icon, Leatherface, that has plagued the nightmare land of movie viewers since he first hit the screen in 1974. And now a new generation has their own version of this terrifying tale.<br /><br />Director Marcus Nispel and screenplay author Scott Kosar have decided not to remake the same film seen before so much as retool it for a new set of viewers. Yes, Leatherface is there as well as a weird family. But these folks are not the same ones we saw oh those many years ago.<br /><br />The film opens in the late 70's with a group of friends coming back from a trip to Mexico, heading to a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert. Along the way, they nearly run down a young woman walking alongside the road. Giving her a lift, they sit in stunned silence as she talks of everyone being dead, of there being no escape. And then she pulls a pistol out from between her legs and shoots herself in the head.<br /><br />The friends are stunned and pull off the road. When they set out again, they stop in a local gas station and contact the sheriff who tells them he will meet them near his current location. When they arrive at this destination, they find more than the bargained for.<br /><br />Once tired of waiting, they head out to find a phone and do so in an old house. Dealing with a cantankerous old man there, they get hold of the Sheriff and head back to wait. Circumstances lead to their returning to the house later on and that's when Leatherface pops up to make his first, brain busting appearance.<br /><br />As in most horror films of this type, the movie moves forward as one by one the teens are picked off by the bad guys. The fact that Leatherface doesn't act on his own makes the story even creepier. But it's those scenes of him swinging the chainsaw high and low, the sound of the gas powered engine revving at high speeds that makes it unnerving.<br /><br />The movie offers plenty of scares and jump scenes that catch you off guard. The character of Leatherface is once more one of the most horrific images you can imagine. The pace of the film, the dialogue, the acting, the directing all go hand in hand to create one of the scariest movies this season.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest difference between this movie and the original is the gore factor. I can remember so many people telling me about all of the gore that they witnessed in the original. In going back and watching it now, I am amazed at how little there actually was. Instead, director Tobe Hooper did a fantastic job of making you THINK you saw more than you really did. This time around though, the gore is there, from sledgehammers slammed into head to chainsaws ripping through flesh.<br /><br />While some movies are meant to be seen on a small television screen, this one is not. Does the size of the picture make a difference? No. But...sitting in a darkened theater with 300 strangers watching and waiting for the inevitable to happen makes this movie scarier than even those making it could have hoped for. Next time don't wait for the DVD&lt; head out to a darkened theater near you. In the meantime, give this one a watch if you're a horror fan. If you like scary films, then you won't want to miss this one.</p></body></html>

The real man this film is based on was an ITALIAN from ITALY.  His story had absolutely nothing to do with the United States.  Oh, and our troops did not leave piles of working M-16 Rifles abandoned in Grenada or anywhere else for that matter.  Absolutely unreal how Hollywood will do anything to turn the facts into fiction in order to trance the masses.  Michael Moore would have been proud, but at least Moore does try to apply some balance and facts.  This thing was nothing more than a fictional story.  It also left out the fact that the three countries who are thick in arms deal ings seem to not have "USA" applied on them anywhere.  I could go on and on about it, but hey, at least now you know so you are not like so many who are saying "yeah, this is TRUTH!!"  So be sure to do your research, and don't believe everything you hear even though you really, really want to.</p></body></html>

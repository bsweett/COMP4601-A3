Environmentalist preaching is conspicuously and annoyingly included.  Yes, this is all true.  And you know what?  I DIDN'T CARE!  All you have to do is sit back and RELAX to enjoy Roland Emmerich's rip-roaringly fun and exciting "The Day After Tomorrow".<p>The "genius" of this film is its ability to draw the audience into the story and make you feel as if you are there and that all of this chaos is actually occurring right outside the movie theater.  Now, of course, in a utopian society people wouldn't enjoy watching disaster and destruction to such a great extent, but we humans have an odd fascination with disaster and therefore this film satisfies our craving.  <p>"The Day After Tomorrow" also has an uncanny ability to convince us (at least up until we leave the theater) that this whole scenario is plausible and scientifically justified (Dennis Quaid's scientist character gives several convincing, if not preachy, global warming speeches).  Upon leaving the theater, you do reflect back on the film and realize how ludicrous the scientific reasoning is, but it does manage to convince you temporarily and add to the realism and level of audience involvement throughout.<p>The dynamite cast of Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal (yum!), Ian Holm, Sela Ward, and Emmy Rossum do a spectacular job.  Though they are often forced to utter some of the most outlandish dialogue I've heard in ages, they do manage to retain their dignity and credibility as actors.<p>"The Day After Tomorrow" is a fantastically entertaining and engaging film; the perfect summer blockbuster, that delivers the goods as long as you don't take it too seriously.</p></body></html>

Based on true story of mobster turned snitch, Henry Hill, the movie moves from Henry's teenage years as a fledgling to his rise in ranks to his ultimate downfall.  Shot at a frenetic pace and mixing violence and a weird sense of humor, the film takes us on a roller coaster ride.  Ray Liotta play Henry and he narrates the film along with his wife Karen, played by Lorraine Bracco.  Mr. Liotta plays Henry as guy whom simply loves the life he leads.  What could be better than being in the mob, the money, the women, the drugs, the respect.  He can't understand how anyone could work in a boring 9-5 job.  Ms. Bracco is annoyingly good as the nagging wife from a Jewish family who is thrown into the Italian culture.  Joe Pesci plays Tommy DeVito who is another hood.  Tommy is basically a psychotic killer and Mr. Pesci plays him with a manic humor.  Robert De Niro is Jimmy Burke, who as Henry says, just loves to steal.  He ends up becoming paranoid after committing the biggest heist in history.  Paul Sorvino is Paulie, the family's leader and he plays him with the attitude and walk of a man who is worthy of the immense respect he gets. No movie has ever incorporated music into scenes as well as Mr. Scorcese does here. Whether it's Donovan's &quot;Atlantis&quot; playing during the beating of a man or the piano coda from &quot;Layla&quot; played when bodies of people Jimmy had knocked off are found, the music truly sets the scene.  Again, as it did ten years prior, the Academy gave the best director award to an actor turned first-time director.  This time Kevin Coster won for the overbearing Dances With Wolves and Mr. Scorcese was deprived of an award he so richly deserved.</p></body></html>

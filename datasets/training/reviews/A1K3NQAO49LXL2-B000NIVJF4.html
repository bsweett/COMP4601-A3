Stupid and characterless Scotsman goes to Uganda, is charmed by Idi Amin, lives his life in a dream, and then gets rescued - he does nothing, and is only a burden on the people around him. Great lines, though - "Welcome to the president's car." "Me and Bobby McGee" sung by Ugandan singer, sounds great. "We are not a game, we are real. I think that your death will be the first real thing that has happened to you." Getting beaten in a duty-free shop before a fluke saving. But the story wasn't real at all, nothing is real.</p></body></html>

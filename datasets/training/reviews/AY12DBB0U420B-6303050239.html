But here with "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly" separating the two becomes almost impossible since there's three and they all have temporary fleeting alliances in the greedy search for gold coinage at about the time of the civil war. Anything goes. It makes for an interesting story and fascinating character study, if you like your stories punctuated with a lot of assorted violence and gunfire. So be it. Director Sergio Leone does a masterful job of telling said tail in a stark dreary, wild-west environment. As with most Clint Eastwood movies, everyone gets beat to a pulp but manages to come back to deliver revenge and put bullet holes through an astonishing number of people. It's action packed and rather fun to watch. Rated R for violence, and it earned it.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

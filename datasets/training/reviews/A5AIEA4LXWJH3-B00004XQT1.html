<meta name="summary" content="Great Video and Audio Quality"></head><body><p>Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />I must have a different Blu-Ray version than others, because I thought the video quality was excellent.  Only one short, dark scene was bad.  The rest of it was great.  Some of the faces looked like plastic though, but that could have been the makeup.  Most of the movie looked very high-def.<br /><br />The audio soundtracks were a little outdated.  I had the choice of "English 6.1 DTS ES" (High Resolution), and "English Dolby Digital 5.1 EX".  I selected the DTS, and it was very good, although the movie didn't have a whole lot of surround sound.</p></body></html>

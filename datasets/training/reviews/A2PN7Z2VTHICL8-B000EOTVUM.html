<meta name="summary" content="This movie couldn't scare a flea off a dog"></head><body><p>If you want to watch a tiresome dialogue between three young adults before and after climbing into a car to do some camp traveling, then by all means grab this movie.  But when forty-five minutes pass and there has not been one drop of blood or any evidence of upcoming chills, its time to eject and chalk it off to wishful thinking.<br /><br />After waiting far too long for something scary or gory to happen, along comes an Australian Outback Redneck with a tow truck to drive our boring camp party to their deaths.  The movie was based on a true story where a group of kids disappear without a trace in the Outback.  I can see the writer's scratching the bald spots on their heads, flakes of dandruff fluttering down around the crumpled papers on their desk, asking each other, "So what happened to them?"  "Well, let's just keep the lead-in going until we figure something out."<br /><br />There is no suspense, boring dialogue, no feeling of creeping dread, a lot of driving and/or running about at night, very little blood or gore (with the exception a finger-chopping), and no surprises.  The characterizations were too obvious, even the redneck was far too typical to feel like a threat.  The only shivers I got from 'Wolf Creek' were the mounting feelings of dread stemming from the fact that I had actually paid to rent it.<br /><br />To the performer's credit, the acting, while far from spectacular, was okay.  There is also one very good line in the movie, "Head On A Stick."  This is referring to one of the girls when her spinal cord is severed (shown abstractly, not graphically -- the finger scene was worse).  The writer that came up with that line should be the only one to get paid for this piece of cinematic tripe.<br /><br />My recommendation: if you are curious, use a free coupon to rent it.  Don't pay any money to watch this movie.</p></body></html>

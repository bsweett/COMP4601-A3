<meta name="summary" content="Style and substance find a common ground in &quot;Memento.&quot;"></head><body><p>The state of confusion I am left in after watching &quot;Memento&quot; is one that is as thought-provoking as it is maddening. The plot twists and surprises that director Christopher Nolan employs in his energetic, frenetic script are intelligent to a fault, ones that tease the mind for hours after the film has ended. And while I was still left with questions about certain plot points and character relations, I was nonetheless enthralled by the experience. <p>At the center of this frenzy is Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), a former insurance investigator in search of the man responsible for the rape and murder of his wife. His search is complicated by the fact that, due to his inability to create new memories, his short-term memory is of no help. He quickly forgets the beginnings of conversations with those he comes in contact with; his only way of staying on track are small notes on paper, Polaroids of those he meets and their names, and homemade tattoos that cover his chest and left thigh. <p>And here's a surprising twist: the film is told from the end to the beginning, starting out with what should be the film's climax and taking things from there to the very beginning of Leonard's search. This is little more than a device, though it tends to make us ponder the film's many machinations on a much more intricate level of thought. There is more to keep up with, which makes it even more interesting. <p>As we progress into the film, we are introduced to characters that Leonard has already interacted with at some earlier point in the reversed story. By the movie's midpoint, many of the puzzle pieces are in place: Leonard has been receiving help from Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), who is out for revenge against someone who took the life of her own love. At the same time, Leonard interacts with the man we see him killing in the beginning, Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), who offers him information we automatically assume is bogus. <p>Or is it? The movie keeps this a secret even after its ending, inviting us to think on the subject, to ponder on the film's many turns and spins. There are so many questions that come to mind: who is really responsible for the murder of his wife? Who is the real ringmaster behind all of the mayhem that goes on throughout the film? Who is the mastermind? By the time we finish thinking about it, we're more concerned with who is on top rather than who killed Mrs. Shelby. <p>And that is precisely what makes this such a fascinating film. It will turn many off for its lack of a final resolution that is blatantly obvious to everyone, but those in the mood for some deep thought will not pass this up. The ending provides no answers, no easy solution to its complex formula of mystery, leaving we, the viewers, to ponder the final conclusion in our own minds, and decipher what has just come to pass in front of our eyes. <p>The film has its share of effective performances that range from subtle mysterious to all-out masterful. Guy Pearce brings a hushed fervor to his character, embodying Leonard with an inner willpower that keeps the film at a fever pitch. Carrie-Anne Moss is eerily mysterious as Natalie, whose intentions play a bigger role than you would first consider. Joe Pantoliano gives his character just the right appearance, that which instills a great sense of suspicion for his character, Teddy, who uses Leonard's memory loss to his advantage. <p>My advice to anyone who sees &quot;Memento&quot; is simply this: don't give up on it. Appearances can be deceiving, and this is a fine example of that. Nolan's reversal device enhances rather than diminishes the movie's effects, perhaps because it allows us the chance to give serious thought to the events going on. I entered into this realm of filmmaking not knowing what to expect; I came out with a thought-produced headache of pure satisfaction.</p></body></html>

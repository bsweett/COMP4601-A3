Suffice it to say that it is the very first full length animated feature film ever made, that the gamble taken by Walt Disney paid off handsomely and the film in most respects was the catalyst for the expansion of his company into one of the biggest entertainment conglomerates in the world. The film spawned a whole new genre that has to a very large extent been the exclusive domain of the Walt Disney Company since 1937, and you only have to wander through the names of the memorable animated features that they have created to understand the impact they have had on family entertainment for the last sixty four years. Pinocchio, Bambi, Cinderella, Peter Pan, The Jungle Book, The Little Mermaid, Beauty And The Beast and The Lion King just to name a few of the many gems in their catalogue. And it all begin with Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs. Somewhat pretentiously, the Walt Disney Company have always afforded the film the appellation of "masterpiece" for its infrequent theatrical and video releases, but if there is one film in their catalogue that does live up to that pretentious appellation then it is Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs.<br /><br />Like just about every reviewer in the world, I am not going to provide a plot synopsis, for the story is so well-known that there seems little point in rehashing it again. Suffice it to say that anyone of any age, other than those born since its last theatrical incarnation in 1993 and video release in 1994, is unlikely not to have seen the film or at the very least heard of the story. In our modern world, the story is incredibly simple and to some extent quite quaintly naive, but simplicity is often a wondrous thing, for it is that simplicity that keeps the crowds flocking back to see the film on its occasional theatrical releases and to add the video to the collection on its infrequent video releases.<br /><br />Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs is a landmark film in every respect and is one of the true classics. Nothing more needs to be said other than to ask the question: has the DVD release done justice to the film? After eighteen hours of watching, listening and typing over six days, let me assure you that you are going to be buying one of the very best DVD packages we have ever seen, period.</p></body></html>

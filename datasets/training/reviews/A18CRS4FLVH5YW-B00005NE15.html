<meta name="summary" content="John Carpenter and company release this on DVD NOW!"></head><body><p>This movie is ripe ripe ripe for DVD release!  In a time when movies are all but drown in CGI special effects and shed only mere crumbs of atmosphere in comparison to this flick, it's time for "The Fog," to come "rolling" in on DVD.  The comment made about this being a "great film for film students," could not be anymore true!  John Carpenter was the master at creating creepy visuals without using a lot of sound effects.  Many of the sound effects you do here in John Carpenters earlier works are simple, short and spooky as hell!  Unfortunately, by today's Hollywood standards lots of blood and unnecessary dialogue is necessary and effective to convolute a second rate story. (Joke)  The horror genre is far from dead but it's gonna take someone to learn a thing or two from movies like "The Fog," to bring those attributes to life.  Amazon.com and the powers that be, bring this movie to DVD NOW!!!  It's time for a new generation of viewers to take notice of this brilliant and highly effective horror film!</p></body></html>

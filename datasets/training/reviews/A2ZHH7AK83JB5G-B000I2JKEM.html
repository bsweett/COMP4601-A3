The animation is unique and well done as Tim Burton does a superb job of creating the bleak upstairs world of the living and the colorful much more jolly downstairs of the well - not living.  The storyline actually has some important universal themes which is not surprising when you consider that this is based on an old folk tale.  The movie is often darkly funny and the Danny Elfman music is perfect as always.  While this is probably not appropriate for most kids under ten or so it is great choice for the tween age crowd. I think I might like Burton's other dark tinged animated film THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS a bit better but this is also a very worthy effort.</p></body></html>

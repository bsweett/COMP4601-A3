There was a time when not all movies were sequels. Kevin Costner knows this. He may be punished for it at the box office, but his "Open Range" is a film that does not pander to 20-year-old boys who consider stupidity a reason to see a movie.<p>"Open Range" is not boring at all. It is involving. It has an actual screenplay with a beginning, middle and end. It pays homage to Western traditions without wallowing in them. It has movements and themes, and does not set up a single situation without resolving it. It is beautifully shot and skillfully directed by a man who understands and cares about the epic style. It is funny, dramatic and philosophical. You know, all those things that "The Hulk" wasn't.<p>There are no special effects in this movie, not on a "Matrix"/"Star Wars" level. Perhaps that baffles some people. Here is a movie that depends on characters and mood. I loved every minute of "Open Range;" it was everything I'd been hoping it would be. The sold-out audience I saw it with also seemed deeply appreciative of Costner's willingness to tell a story without the usual bells and whistles.<p>The movie also depends on acting. Duvall deserves an Oscar nod, and Costner and Bening were also outstanding (Costner, especially). People say the romance felt forced; I felt it was integral to the Costner character's essential dilemma.<p>Look, Costner has been in some bad movies. He made a real stinker back in 1997. Show me a movie star who doesn't have a bomb on his resume. "Open Range" is a terrific movie and I look forward to the DVD release.</p></body></html>

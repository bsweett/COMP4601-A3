<meta name="summary" content="Exciting yesterday and still exciting today...."></head><body><p>Indiana Jones is a character that is timeless. He makes treasure hunting look soooo easy! His vast knowledge keeps him one step ahead of the bad guys or curses (which ever one is in the way) and he always gets the girl even if he doesn't want her!<br /><br />Raiders of the Lost Ark - Keeps you hopping through the jungle to the desert with lots of action along the way.<br /><br />Temple of Doom - Gives new meaning to sacrifices and just who gets to be the sacrifice!<br /><br />Last Crusade- Brings Sean Connery in as dad and there is no better combination of father and son. The camaraderie between these two will keep you in stitches and the action gives you plenty of excitement.<br /><br />There are a few intense scenes and language so I can't recommend this set for all ages.</p></body></html>

Sort of"></head><body><p>It is just absolutely amazing to see how suddenly Jack Black has emerged into the public eye despite a relatively lengthy career in films. It was his hysterical performance opposite Colin Hanks, Tom Hank's son, in Orange County that brought him fully into the mainstream spectrum but amazingly his feature film hasn't been confined to the comedy genre. Since his first appearance on screen in 1992, Black has appeared in such solemn features such as Waterworld, Dead Man Walking, and Enemy of the State. Hollywood soon became aware of the inspiring comedian when starred in the Farrelly Brothers comedy, Shallow Hal, and then the irreverent comedy, Saving Silverman. Now Jack Black's future is bigger and better then ever before with superior roles in three films in 2004: Envy, Shark Tale, and Anchorman. Not only that but Black's metal parody band, Tenacious D, has the potential to be another successful vehicle for the rising star, as his leading role in The School of Rock shows he has the enthusiasm and the look of a real rocker.<p>The story follows an out of work rocker who takes a substitute teacher position at a preppy grade school to get back at his former band members who dumped him from the band. Dewey Finn knows everything there is to know about the history of rock n' roll. He knows every band, every instrument, and every chord ... Rock n' roll is in his blood. The only thing he doesn't know is when to act mature. During a major band performance, Dewey goes off on a twenty guitar solo and acts in a way that not only embarrasses the band but himself as well. Dewey's fellow band members are fed up and, without any other choice, decide to vote him out of the band. With the pressure of his buddy's girlfriend to pay his share of the rent, the fledgling rocker impersonates a substitute teacher and takes a position at an uptight private school. Upon discovering the musical talents of the fourth graders he is placed to educate, Dewey decides to enter the group into a battle of the bands contest that pits the youngsters against his former band mates. Through his senseless antics and irreverent attitude, the children soon learn to break out of their shells and be who they want to be. The story for the School of Rock is decently played out but for the most part the plot is pretty predictable which takes away some of the emotional feelings you might have for the situation and/or the characters. In a film that preaches the message of breaking away from the conventional, School of Rock contradicts itself pretty easily.<p>The cast is pretty minuscule but that doesn't matter too much as the feature relies solely on the energetic performance of Jack Black, which is all that truly matters for this film. If you are not a fan of the work of Jack Black then you are going to have a hard time tolerating this film but even if you are non-partisan in the matter, you aren't exactly going to be rolling in the aisles laughing either. It's not that Black's performance isn't funny, it is, in parts, but for the most part his crazy antics come off as being more annoying then anything else. Joan Cusack is greatly under used in this film and it was rather disappointing to see the filmmakers not exploring the relationship more between her character and Black's.<p>Overall, The School of Rock reforms the school of thought on the conventional family film but not so much so that it will spark a new trend in Hollywood. It's not that the feature isn't entertaining, it is. The problem is that it is nothing more then that. The feeling this film leaves you with is hard to describe, so here's the best way one can put it: If you are at a buddy's house for a night with your best friends and the School of Rock is the film of choice, you won't exactly try to weasel everyone out of watching it but you wouldn't exactly be jumping for joy either. Despite a decent performance from Black, delightful performances from the children, and a rockin' song selection, the entire feature film, in the end, just feels flat. The message of the film also seems a bit lost as it preaches a break away from the conventional but at the same advocates children to fight against "the man" or authority, which is definitely a wrong message to send to the young children of America. There are enough problems out there with children disrespecting their parents, school administrators, etc. without this film sermonizing the message of deviance of authority. This may not be the exact way the filmmakers may have intended but it does come off that way. Bottom-line is that School of Rock will do as an entertaining diversion but nothing you essentially need to see before more worthy features like Lost in Translation or Matchstick Men.</p></body></html>

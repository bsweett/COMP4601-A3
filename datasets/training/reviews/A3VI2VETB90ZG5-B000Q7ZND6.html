<meta name="summary" content="Touchy-Feely Demon Movie"></head><body><p>If you're going to watch this movie, you've really got to watch it in HD! This "Constantine" HD DVD exhibits some of the most outstanding visual sequences you'll find in a demon movie, or otherwise - way cool stuff! The transfer is very clean and top-notch.<br /><br />The Dolby TrueHD soundtrack is a great feature to enhance this otherwise thematic audio track: the dialog is as if spoken in the public library, and all of the demon encounters are as if you're smack in the middle of the action. That's just the style though, but this "quiet dialog" style is the sort of thing which makes me want to get it over with or go to sleep - one of the two...overall the movie does sound great.<br /><br />The whole demon movie genre doesn't do much for me...never really did. The chanting, the touching, and the controversial symbols that bring out the people who like to make a big to-do about anything controversial - it's all too much for me. These are typical features which lend themselves to predictability, but if these elements aren't there, then it isn't a demon movie anymore - a catch 22. Does this mean that once you've seen this kind of movie you've seen 'em all? I think it does [for me].<br /><br />The good news here is that "Constantine" is very modern, it's extremely huge in production value, and it has some awesome visual appeal that's fresh enough to make this movie quite an entertaining film.<br /><br />There's tons of features form behind the story, to additional footage (deleted scenes), a music video, two feature commentaries by two groups of two of four different people, teaser and theatrical trailers, and an IME with Director Francis Lawrence.<br /><br />I recommend "Constantine" (mostly for the special effects).</p></body></html>

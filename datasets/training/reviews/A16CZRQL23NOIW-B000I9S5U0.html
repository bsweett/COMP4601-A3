Victim of the Great Depression, Braddock possessed a true steel frame of mind. He knew about his personal gifts and believed in himself as nobody else, to recover not only the World Heavy Weight Championship but his whole self stem.<br /><br />In the Thirties there were two admirable sport feats: the most famous was obviously this one and the another was the impressive triumph of Jose Capablanca in Chess.<br /><br />Ron Howard was wonderful around this dazzling handle camera. Crowe made an towering performance specially with that premonitory gaze when he saw Baer with Primo Carnera. Special applauses to Rene Zellweger and Grimanti who looked very fresh and engaging with that role.<br /><br />A winner film under any perspective you look at.</p></body></html>

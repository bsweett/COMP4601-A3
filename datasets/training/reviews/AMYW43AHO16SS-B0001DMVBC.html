<meta name="summary" content="Beautifully photographed and well acted drama!"></head><body><p>Oscar winners Jennifer Connelly and Ben Kingsley give solid performances as rivals who both want the same house to call their own.  I enjoyed the way this film was photographed.  This movie was based on the book by Andre Dubus III.  Faithful readers will notice the difference as the film takes on a different perspective, concentrating on both rivals, rather than the family as a whole.  Take a star away for that reason.  Overall, its still a powerful movie to watch.</p></body></html>

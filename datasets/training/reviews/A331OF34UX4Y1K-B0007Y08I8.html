Theproducers really made theirbest with the puppets.<br /><br />This movie is plain fun. A lot of jokes are good. Of course, coming from Trey Parker and Matt Stone, there are the usual flatulence jokes, vomit jokes, sex jokes. But they are much more restrained and well placed than the South Park feature lenght movie.<br /><br />The soundtrack is clever, simple and right to the point. In truthe (as you can see in teh special features) this is a joke about Jerry Bruckenheimer movies. I enjoyed the whole movie, no weak spots here.</p></body></html>

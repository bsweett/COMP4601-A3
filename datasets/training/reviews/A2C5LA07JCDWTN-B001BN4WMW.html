It speaks volumes too about the war that we have been forced to wage recently. Anyway, Braveheart is nothing short of spectacular. The battle sequences are breathtaking, epic, and completely convincing. Mel Gibson does an excellent job directing such a large scale project and Braveheart succeeds on multiple levels. The character development is excellent and the viewer comes to deeply care about the Wallace character and his motley crew. At it's core, Braveheart is a love story. The tale of a man forced to wage a war that he had no intention of fighting. Avenging the death of his slain love, William Wallace besieges the English colonizers  and liberates Scotland in the name of freedom. This film is an inspirational call to arms and is truly American down to it's very core. Funny that this would come from an Aussie, eh? I can honestly say that Braveheart is one of the best films I have ever seen, no DVD collection will be complete without it. Highest Recommendation.</p></body></html>

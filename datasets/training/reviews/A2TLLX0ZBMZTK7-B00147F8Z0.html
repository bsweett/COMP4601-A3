The characters weren't developed hardly at all, and it was way too dark to see anything that was going on. I mean seriously, every time an alien attacked I kept moving around, trying to find any angle where I could actually see what was happening. Alas, I found no angle. So yeah, bad characters, awful lighting, and the story wasn't even halfway decent. I wouldn't look into this... -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare</p></body></html>

We never tire of watching it and it feels like England, a thing I prize above all in English film. (And I do not restrict this feeling to British film.)<br /><br />-The performances here are so dazzling that one forgets that in the film, Diana, her brother, and several others "play" themselves thanks to the stunning genius of Stephen Frears.<br /><br />-The soundtrack by Andre Desplat, which I have reviewed, is haunting and superior to most soundtracks I've heard in my life.<br /><br />-Helen Mirren does a frighteningly wonderful job portraying Her Majesty. I was in total commiseration with her throughout the entire film. It was PM Blair who sort of angered me. Lucky they took so many liberties with the truth (which we shall never know in full).<br /><br />-Before hitting Sylvia Sims too harshly for her portrayal of the Queen Mother, bear in mind Frears had begged Joan Plowright to take the role. I think Plowright was too busy filming some crappy film. What a difference it would have made, but Sims does her job!<br /><br />-The scenes at what is supposed to be Balmoral are airy and beautiful. It conveys perfectly what life can be like there, even though no one was anywhere near Balmoral, Cowes, or anywhere like that.<br /><br />If you don't already own and cherish this movie, you are a prize lunk-head!</p></body></html>

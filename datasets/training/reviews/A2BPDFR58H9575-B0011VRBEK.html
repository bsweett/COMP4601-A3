<meta name="summary" content="Who are you, Mr. Vengeance?"></head><body><p>You can learn a few things from this ultra violent, darker than dark Drama / Mystery / Thriller with the occasional elements of humor: you will learn the new meaning of words Fresh Sea Food, you will never be able to listen to Vivaldi's "Four Seasons" the same way again, you will think twice before going to your Dentist's office. Be careful of what you say about anyone - you never know how your words can (and will) affect their (and what is most important your) life. And the last but not the least, revenge is the dish better served cold, 15 years cold. Without spoiling anything, no matter how far and how fast we try to get away from our destiny, each step would bring us closer to it until the inevitable and shocking "Appointment in Samarra".<br /><br />I have mixed feelings for the movie. It is very impressive, and trying to take the story in its second hour to Sophocles's realm was a clever twist but something stops me from pronouncing it great. The more I think the less I like it and the reasons are incoherent plotting, very ambiguous moral equation, and technical sloppiness that insult my intelligence.<br /><br />Threre are two things that impressed me the most - fascinating performance by an octopus (sadly, it was its one and only performance) and the story of a guy with a little dog that we never heard. I'd love to hear his story.<br /><br />5.5/10</p></body></html>

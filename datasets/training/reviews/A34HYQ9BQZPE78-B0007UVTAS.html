<meta name="summary" content="Undoubtedly a seminal horror film and a landmark for zombie movies everywhere!"></head><body><p>With time running out before Halloween and remembering my promise to myself to write 31 horror movie reviews by the time of the 31st, I felt as though I were running low, considering how in the past I've already reviews plenty of horror movies. Then I thought, "Hhmm...I haven't done a review for Night of the Living Dead yet!". So here it is, a review of what is considered probably the most important and influential zombie movie of all time.<br /><br />Although it's not the first movie in the zombie-horror subgenre, ("White Zombie" beat it, being made in 1932) "Night of the Living Dead" is without a doubt, the most infleuntial zombie movie of all time, and probably the greatest one, too. Although it lacks the gore of later Romero classics such as "Dawn of the Dead" or "Day of the Dead", "Night of the Living Dead" is still a revolutionary horror film for several huge reasons.<br /><br />First off, having a black guy as a hero was a big step at the time, considering this movie was made in the late '60s. Romero wanted to show that with the changing times, there was no racial boundaries on who gets to be the hero in a movie. And although I'm a white guy, I like his decision a lot, because it showcases a call to revolution.<br /><br />Also, the movie itself is a social and political statement, about the new society, in this case, literally devouring the old one. Had the new society's devourment of the old society only been for the better this day and age...it's tough for me to be young and growing up in our culture these days! But Romero definitely had a brilliant idea with that underlying message in mind.<br /><br />Now, we're on to the zombies. Combining the claustrophobic atmosphere of the house and the overpowering feeling of fear and doom caused by the start of the zombie apocalypse, "Night of the Living Dead" gets everything right. Although fast zombies were to be later featured in more recent horror films, the zombies in "Night of the Living Dead" are the epitome of classic, death-paced, flesh-eating horrid fiends.<br /><br />I saw the movie online so I know nothing about the different DVD versions but I hear that the Millennium Edition is the best to get, so getting that one is probably the best thing. However, I did read that when purchasing any version of "Night of the Living Dead", none of the money will go to George A. Romero or any of the makers, so watching it online might be a good alternative. Any way you watch it, this is a zombie movie classic! Thanks for the time, and peace.</p></body></html>

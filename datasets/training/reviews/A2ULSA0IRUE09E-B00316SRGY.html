Only an institution as archaic and delusional as the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences could neglect this work of art during awards season, and like "Changeling", this too was shut out in all major categories (and sadly, even from the minor categories). What this says about the members' cinematic tastes one can only speculate upon, but chances are they haven't properly understood the depth and brilliance contained within this concise motion picture.<br /><br />As one reviewer aptly stated, this film is not about the car (1972 was a good year for Ford), but the car does come to represent the very essence of the lead character. He plays a mean-spirited old man who is racist, conservative, rude and anti-social, but at the heart of it he seems to be the very opposite of all these things. The film casts him as the sole white resident of an increasingly ethnically diverse lower-income neighborhood, and his attitudes (as vintage as his car) seem to reflect a dying America that seems unable to cope with the diversity brought about by immigration.<br /><br />The film also pays homage to the Hmong people, a true group of Eastern people who were displaced early on, and who have found pockets of solace within America. Even within Eastern societies, this particular group of people have been looked upon as overly conservative and traditional, a fact that the film lovingly pays tribute to, without hitting you over the head with it. Many mainstream publications seem to indicate that this film is about tackling racism and overcoming color lines. Well, that is but part of it, and in many ways not even. Race becomes a very secondary issue here, and by the end of the film you find yourself unable to find the issue relevant at all.<br /><br />Ultimately, the story is about a widower who finds he has no purpose in life, but he also has a difficult past, having been in the military at one point. There are thousands of such veterans all over the world, and this could be their story. Whats incredible is that even though most of our lives are far removed from the lead characters', you will find yourself empathizing with the character, and his racist attitudes seem almost humorous (it also seems that he is less racist than he is territorial).<br /><br />"Gran Torino" is not a thriller or a fast-paced action film as its' misleading cover might indicate. Hardly. There are a few scenes of violence and one unnerving segment featuring a female lead (a great acting job by Eastwood here), but other than that, this is largely dialog driven. Its' most affecting segments come when Eastwood tries to integrate with his Eastern neighbors - largely humorous, but you'll find yourself relating to these scenes in ways you hadn't imagined. The standout performance is by the young lad who plays Thao, who plays the second lead - its an innocent, camera-friendly performance that relies more on fortitude than actual acting, but he does a commendable job.<br /><br />This is also clearly not a film for everybody. Some may find it heavy-handed and unbelievable, but the end of the film is so moving and apt, that it should get to the most jaded viewer. Prime bits of trivia also litter the films sets, and more educated audiences will have fun trying to pick up on them. For the record, this also marks the debut of Clint Eastwoods' youngest child, a 21 year old actor. Try to find out where he features - its one of the standouts of the entire film for many reasons.<br /><br />Four and a Half Stars. A beautiful work of cinema, and testament to the fact that Clint gets better with age.</p></body></html>

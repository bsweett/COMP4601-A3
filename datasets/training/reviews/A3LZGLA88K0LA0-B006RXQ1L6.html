<meta name="summary" content="DISAPPOINTING BUT WELL DONE"></head><body><p>CHICAGO won the best picture oscar a couple of years ago, and at the time, I had not seen it, but being a fan of movie musicals over the years, I was happy for its success.  Also, one can't fault a movie with a cast like this one.  However, after finally seeing it, I am disappointed.  Several reasons:  the show has no real showstopping, hummable songs---even ALL THAT JAZZ doesn't carry the movie like DON'T RAIN ON MY PARADE, OH WHAT  BEAUTIFUL MORNING and HELLO DOLLY.  The deleted "Class" is an awful, foul-mouthed attempt at humor, but it certainly showcased the vocal abilities of Catherine Zeta Jones and Queen Latifah.  Also, the leading ladies were murderesses:  how could one want either of them to be successful?  Latifah, though Oscar nominated, is playing the same shtick she does in any of her movies, and in my opinion, didn't deserve an Oscar nomination.  The revelations, of course, were Zeta Jones, Renee Zellwegger, Richard Gere and John C. Reilly's vocal deliveries.  Gere truly took a chance as a singing, dancing Billy Flynn, but he is marvelous and he DID deserve an Oscar nod.  Reilly too is revealing in his CELLOPHANE MAN number; he has a richly nuanced voice and it's one of the best numbers in the film.  Zeta-Jones also had much more pizzazz and energy than Zellwegger.  I've read where the transfer to film brought Roxie's character to the front, and minimized Velma's.  Who knows how great it would have been if Velma and Zeta-Jones had more screen time.  I do think Catherine deserved her Oscar, though.  This beautiful actress is talented and has shown diversity in her many roles.  Zellwegger always seems to be playing the same Nurse Betty and Cold Mountain characters in all of her films.<br /><br />CHICAGO is big, blustery and well conceived, but it's just not fun nor moving, and if a movie musical is neither of those, then why add music at all?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A female serial killer through the eyes of liberal Hollywood"></head><body><p>Monster tells the story of Aileen Wuornos , a vagabond prostitute and one of America's first female serial killers. The film picks up just before she begins the killing spree that claimed the lives of nine men, many clients of the enterprising lady-of-the-night, murdered in cars or deep in the woods where they were to partake in her services.<br /><br />The director of the film (Patty Jenkins) uses the life of Wournos to comment on what she sees as the evils of contemporary society. But the target of Jenkins's film is not the killer, but rather a society that the film suggests led Wuornos to commit her crimes. The true villains of the world (according to Jenkins) are not serial killers, but rather capitalism, patriarchy and homophobia. These are the true "monsters" of the film, as they are the real reason nine men died at the hands of our hero.<br /><br />OK, maybe calling her the film's "hero" is a bit of a stretch, but the film does work very hard trying to add humanity to a woman who (let me say this again) murdered nine men. Her childhood is sad, her dreams are shattered, and she can't get a real job because her only previous employment consisted of wanking winkies. Therefore, the only thing left for her to do is...start killing people.<br /><br />What I see as dangerous about this movie is that it is indeed based on a real woman and nearly all the facts in the film are true. But this film shows how a write/director can use facts to produce a thesis that doesn't necessarily grow naturally from the story itself. Many people will walk away from this film buying the ideas that drive the film, because (they will say) it is based on fact and must be true.<br /><br />In the hands of a less "enlightened" director, the film would portray a very different Aileen Wuornos. Rather than pointing criticism out at the world around her, a more responsible filmmaker would force the criticism to point back at the star of the film, the monstrous Aileen Wuornos.</p></body></html>

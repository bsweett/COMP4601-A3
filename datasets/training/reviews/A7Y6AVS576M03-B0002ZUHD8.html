There a lot of bloody good killing going on if that's your taste. I found no real substance to the film. The plot was very thin. It was photographed well and there was one very good and innovative scene of a confrontation which takes place on a large frozen span of ice and snow. There are some good bits  strewn throughout but not enough to make this film anything more than just average.</p></body></html>

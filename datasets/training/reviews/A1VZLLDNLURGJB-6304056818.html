I never saw this film in the theaters but have been told that it was quite a sight to behold on the wide screen in glorious color. I watched this recent DVD on a 50" wide screen plasma HDTV and the wide screen screen color presentation lived up to the reputation of the film.  The transfer quality was excellent!  Many wonderful extras included with the DVD (see other reviews).</p></body></html>

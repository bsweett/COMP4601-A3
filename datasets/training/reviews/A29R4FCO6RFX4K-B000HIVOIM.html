<meta name="summary" content="One of Verhoven's best"></head><body><p>Paul Verhoven's sci fi thriller Total Recall is one of his best films and also one of his most unashamedly ultra-violent. Verhoven's penchant for violence, strong female charcters and the obligatory nudity are all present and correct. In what would be one of Schwarzenegger's last good action films of late, the big man goes to Mars on a mission. Or does he? And this is what raises the film above standard sci fi fare, the 'is he or isn't he?' twists are clever and make the viewer actually use his/her brain! Shocker!  <p>Plot twists aside, the gore-factor sometimes goes too far, making this a very uneasy watch, and the film does tend to get formulaic at the ending. But it's Verhoven firing off all cylinders here with amazing action, astounding landscapes on Mars, some great one-liners, impressive FX and Arnie pulling a golf ball- sized tracking device out his nose! What more could you want? Extras, you say? Well this DVD has plenty for all the devotees, including a commentary from crazy Verhoven and Arnie going back and forth, 'making of's and tons of production material. A great movie, an equally great disc.</p></body></html>

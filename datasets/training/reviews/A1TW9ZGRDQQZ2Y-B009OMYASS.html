<meta name="summary" content="I'll Be Buying This DVD"></head><body><p>I was in the minority by kinda liking Eli Roth's first film, Cabin Fever, but at least I don't feel alone in liking Hostel. Yes, some reviews here bash the film, but it was a truly hardcore horror film. If you don't like it, go back and watch your overplayed copy of Ring 2. I will be buying this DVD the day it comes out. Bring on Hostel 2!</p></body></html>

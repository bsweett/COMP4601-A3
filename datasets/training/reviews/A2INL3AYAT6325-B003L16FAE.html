<meta name="summary" content="Good action film, OK DVD package"></head><body><p>I have always liked this film.<br /><br />FAVORITE BIT.  JESSE VENTURA & THAT GUN HIS CHARACTER USED!!  Just loved that.<br /><br />Good action film.<br /><br />Script however.  TO THIS DAY I STILL CAN NOT FIGURE OUT IF I HEARD CORRECTLY 1 LINE ARNOLD'S CHARACTER DUTCH SAYS.  MAKES NO SENSE AT ALL.  When, he, Carl Weathers & his men attack the camp the hostages are in.  He yells at one of his men & MAKES NO SENSE.<br /><br />BEFORE we learn Carl's character sent them there for a different reason FOR NO REASON all of Arnold's men treated him like garbage, with an attitude.  What did the character do BEFORE we learn about the REAL MISSION to deserve that?<br /><br />Kind of a tacky DVD package.  Thin card board.  Mine is hard to get closed up.<br /><br />Ok, regular, normal extras.<br /><br />A passable, OK DVD package.</p></body></html>

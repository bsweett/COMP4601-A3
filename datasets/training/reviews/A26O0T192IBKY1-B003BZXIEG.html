Although Cyclops is only "presumed" dead since they didn't find a body, even though he's hardly had any airtime in the last movie either accept for being brainwashed or wussying on about Jean being "presumedly" dead. As for Prof. X's bit at the end, since his body was destroyed, he must've downloaded his consciousness into a comatose body in the facility where Dr. MacTaggert was working at. Jean could of course probably come back too since she's been resurrected more times than Jason, Freddy Kreuger, and Jesus combined!<br /><br />They did a pretty good deal with the extended mutant cast. Although they didn't explain how Beast was in human form in X2, and now he's fully-furry. Callisto got way too many powers from her comic counterpart. Psylocke was dumbed down alot as far as her powers too. Nice to see Multiple Man. Shadowcat finally gets some decent airtime, although it would've been cool to see Jubilee too. Angel was fair, even if he is one of the more boring X-Men. And Juggernaut just rocked! Don't care if he's not really a mutant, that was just gold! It would've been nice if they bothered saying whether Toad or Sabertooth were still alive or not from the first flick, or where the hell Nightcrawler was.<br /><br />For the original cast, they brought this whole darker side to Prof. X that actually made Magneto's side look like the fair one. Magneto was a cold prick though after what happened to Mystique("That's my slave name!"), and him being turned human would've been an act worse than death for him, which might've only been temporary on high-class mutants. Iceman finally ices up, although I don't remember his clothes being visible before when he did that. Rouge pretty much wussed out at the last minute, which I don't know why she's at the Xavier Institute since she's human now. Cyclops just was a whiney bitch as usual. They just couldn't write anything interesting for him after the first movie. Jean's version of the Phoenix's is more like something out of a Stephen King novel. I half-expected to see the 666 sign on her forehead. And...Mystique's a brunette? Say what?<br /><br />Even though alot of reports had come in claiming that this is the last X-flick, they left a big enough room for more. I saw in an interview with the director Brett Ratner about why he doesn't want to do an X4. He said "because there's never been a good Part 4 of a movie franchise". Uh...hello. Star Wars: Episode Iv-A New Hope ring any bells? Plus, Star Trek 4 which was the best of the classic Trek movies. Hell, even Rocky IV wasn't too bad!</p></body></html>

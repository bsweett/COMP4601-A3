<meta name="summary" content=""Office Space" is a necessary comedy in EVERY collection and is great on blu-ray!"></head><body><p>1 Blu-ray disc, released February 2009<br /><br />Some comedy classics stay fresh forever. This one still wins after eleven years.<br /><br />"Office Space" is a Mike Judge comedy about the cubicle life. There are so many memorable characters! Lumbergh played by Gary Cole who drags out all his sentences and Milton played by Stephen Root who is the squirrelly guy with management issues and a red Swingline stapler.<br /><br />It embodies a fantasy of what many office workers feel their life is like and what they would love to do about it working up to the beat down of the fax machine.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />There is a new trivia track called "Post-It Pandemonium" where post-its appear on the screen in random places with facts you probably didn't know or ever need to know necessarily...I thought it would be cool but after a while it gets a little annoying since they cover up faces and other stuff on the screen.<br /><br />If you like games, this has a bunch. You can play Grab the Stapler, Printer Beat-Down, Whack-a-Drone, and Jump to Conclusions 2.0. The "Out of the Office" Office Space Retrospective with Writer/Director Mike Judge allows you to see the animation and voices in the cartoon where Milton and Lumbergh originated. It goes over the casting process of how they found each actor and how that actor interpreted their characters and motivations. There are also eight deleted scenes where Peter is being caught in a lie about his whereabouts, Happy hour at the restaurant where Peter talks about the hypothetical no job scenario, Peter goes off on Nina, Peter grandstanding about life and revelations which doesn't make a lot of sense at that moment in his new carefree zen state, etc. As with almost all deleted scenes, the movie is better without them.</p></body></html>

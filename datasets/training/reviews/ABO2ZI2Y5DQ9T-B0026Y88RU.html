<meta name="summary" content="Great Cast with a Script Too Clever for Its Own Good"></head><body><p>Josh Hartnett plays an unlucky, mild-mannered young guy with a broken nose, arriving at his friend Nick's deserted flat in New York City. There he meets some odd people who think he is Nick: one is a kooky and charming neighbor Lindsay (Lucy Liu) asking him for sugar and starts chatting with him; the other is two gangsters ordering him to come with them to a tightly-guarded room where their Boss (Morgan Freeman) lives a secluded life.<br /><br />But director Paul MaGuigan is not content with this premise which I find is already interesting enough to make a good crime thriller. The film actually begins with another set of stories apparently unrelated to each other, and the body counts rise very fast in the opening 15 minutes. That's even before you meet Josh Hartnett's character.<br /><br />In the second half of the story, the film ties up its loose ends, putting the pieces into the right places. I kept guessing the truths, but I was not impressed or thrilled with the outcome because each piece of the film presented in the opening is not emotionally involving, related in the flashbacks and fast-cut episodic scenes. Someone gets killed suddenly, then another someone, and then ... you will see the truths behind these apparently random killings, but you have to wait for more than one hour.<br /><br />`Lucky Number Slevin' has a potentially intriguing story with a great cast every producer would dream of, including Ben Kingsley, Bruce Willis and Stanley Tucci plus cameo of Danny Aiello and Robert Forster. For all its solid acting and dead-pan humor from some characters, I didn't find the film interesting as other people think because the film tries to explain too much or to include twists and turns more than necessary.</p></body></html>

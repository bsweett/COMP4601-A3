<meta name="summary" content="A Professional, Engrossing Thriller"></head><body><p>I thought this was a solid, adult suspense thriller, heavy on police procedure and light on romantic cliches. Silvia Broone (Nicole Kidman) is an interpreter at the U.N. Her speciality is African languages. One night, when she's in her booth alone overlooking the dark, empty General Assembly, she hears a brief whisper from a wall speaker that suggests a visiting African head of state, a man who has turned into an aged, bloody dictator, will be assassinated. (The opening of the movie establishes the kind of murderous reign he has instituted and is very effective.) Assigned to investigate is Tobin Keller (Sean Penn), a member of the Secret Service section that protects visiting dignitaries. Both have tragedies they're dealing with. Most of Broome's family was killed when the dictator repressed everyone who threatened his rule. Keller's wife has just died in a car accident.<br /><br />Sydney Pollack takes us through the development of these two people's characters and lays out the bones of the plot. The race to find the assassins builds upon methodical police investigation, which is complicated by Broome's own ambivalence. There also are one or two red herrings. The settings add a lot of atmosphere and energy to the movie. Much was shot inside the U.N. building and a great deal was shot on New York City streets.<br /><br />There are one or two times when coincidence seems to play a role, but the action happens fast enough that you don't notice this until the movie's over. The only unsatisfying part for me was the conclusion of the assassination plot. There were a few minutes of heavy melodrama involving Broome, Penn and the aged dictator which seemed to me was designed primarily to show that Kidman and Penn were "actors." That aside, I thought this was a fast-paced, professional film that was fun to watch. And there were some fine performances in the secondary roles, especially Catherine Keener as Keller's Secret Service partner and Jesper Christensen as the dictator's head of security.</p></body></html>

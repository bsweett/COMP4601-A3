This true story was wonderfully written and directed By Stephen Soderborgh.  He has his unique styles in displicting certain important scenes so the audience can understand the deeper atmosphere that these characters are in.  Julia Roberts was well-deserving of her Oscar for Best Actress for the portrayal of this feisty, strong-willed woman.  Her emotional and financial struggles prove that there is always hope for a brighter future.  The real-life Brockovich isn't a bad actress as performed in her small role as a waitress.  The screenplay has many creative words giving it a broader emotional edge.  Some are funny.  This will force the audience to listen closer to what every character says, especially Brockovich.<p>I've owned this movie for two years, and I still find new and better reasons to love it everytime I watch it.  I'm sure you'll think the same.</p></body></html>

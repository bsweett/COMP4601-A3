<meta name="summary" content="Very honest biopic..."></head><body><p>...which doesn't try to cover over Ray Charles' darker side, namely his heroin addiction and serial adultery.  Usually most biopics either gloss over or moralize about such things, this film mercifully just tells it like it is.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx most certainly deserved his Oscar for this performance, and he's backed by a strong cast.  Of course the music is sensational, and it was usually very hard to tell when Foxx was lip-syncing.<br /><br />My only disappointment was that this film seems to suggest that Charles simply up and quit heroin once and for all---which if true would be extremely remarkable since heroin is the type of drug that usually takes years and years of falling off the wagon and getting back on, before you finally break free.</p></body></html>

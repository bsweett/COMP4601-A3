<meta name="summary" content="Solid and Moving Dramatic Thriller"></head><body><p>I went into this film expecting "The International" meets "Minority Report." Instead, the film plays out more like "28 Days Later" meets "Saving Private Ryan." Either way, it's a solid piece of filmmaking that stands out due to it's emotional stance and amazing performances. I was genuinely impressed at the calculated tension the film delivered (the scene with the stalling car nearly stopped my heart!) I rate this movie as a solid 4, and it could have been a 5 if the ending were a little better. (As it stands, it's a sort of sad/abstract ending. Hope is coming, but there's no REAL climax.)<br /><br />Highly recommended work of art!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Talk about a bad case of Empty Nest"></head><body><p>Claire Spencer's (Michelle Pfieffer) daughter Caitlin is heading off to college.  The retired cellist has nothing to do but enjoy her beautiful Vermont home and her delectible husband, Norman Spencer (Harrison Ford).<br /><br />Empty Nest Syndrome is hard, but nobody ever told Claire she'd become obsessed with her fighting neighbors and see the face of a dead girl underwater...Plus, she's facing the anniversary of an auto crash.<br /><br />The first part builds suspense like only Hitchcock could.  I swear Claire hurts herself so often, she's a walking Band-Aid commercial.  She keeps getting startled by the phone, her husband walking up behind her.<br /><br />When Norman has had enough, he urges Claire to seek professional help.  The psychiatrist suggests Claire get in touch with the ghost.  She and her friend Jodi get an Oija board and have seances to summon the neighbor's wife...<br /><br />And the rest keeps you glued to your seat with the hairs standing up on the back of your neck. "What Lies Beneath" goes further than being an homage to Hitchcock and stands on its own as a classic of the horror genre.  I had to watch in a well-lit room -- and my poor cat couldn't even stay on my lap.</p></body></html>

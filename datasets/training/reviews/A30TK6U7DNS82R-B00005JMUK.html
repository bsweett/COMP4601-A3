Some of the extras show her in different stages of makeup, and also researching with the director the very places the real life Aileen Wuornos used to frequent, down in Florida on the ugly side.  I thought Scott Wilson also deserved a nomination, he had also a very resonant part as the last man Aileen managed to kill, the one who tried to help her, who was a family man, thus showing that Aileen had become addicted to murder and that her excuses for murdering these men ("they tried to molest me") had grown paper thin with repetition, even though the first one really did try to murder her and raped her in an ugly way, and yet when the audience watches Scott Wilson die for apparently no reason at all, we're brought back to our memories of him as a handsome young man playing one of the heartless killers in Richard Brooks' IN COLD BLOOD, and we feel that Movie Karma has played a part in deciding his fate.<br /><br />Christina Ricci was pretty good too, though I wonder what the real-life person she's playing had to say about Ricci's portrayal of her as a user, a whiner, a sloth, a slut, and one who would sell out the only person who ever cared for her in the world.<br /><br />Now that the movie OPEN WATER has come out, with its leading actress Blanchard Ryan who is an exact duplicate of the "pretty" Charlize Theron, will we ever see that one again or will we always be seeing the grim one with the Lon Chaney makeup?  That would be a loss because Theron was so alluring in THREE DAYS IN THE VALLEY and THE ITALIAN JOB etc.</p></body></html>

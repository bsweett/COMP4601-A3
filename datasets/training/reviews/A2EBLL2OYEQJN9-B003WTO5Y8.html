<meta name="summary" content="Proves that extreme gore is not necessary for bone-chilling creepiness in a psychological thriller"></head><body><p>Jonathan Demme achieved movie perfection with his adaptation of Thomas J. Harris's novel about  brilliant, pathological, cannibalistic serial killer Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) who is interviewed by FBI agent-in-training Clarice Starling (Jodi Foster) in an attempt to find information about another serial killer currently terrorizing a multi-state region.  The critics obviously agreed, as this was the third movie in history to sweep all five of the top Oscar categories.  The true brilliance of the film lies in its ability to chill the viewer without the use of gore or special effects.  Hearing Dr. Lecter say, "Clarice" will always send chills up my spine.  His demand to get information about Clarice's personal history, in exchange for his help in the serial killer hunt, makes Dr. Lecter all the scarier as a villian.  He has some unforgettable lines in the movie (and Anthony Hopkins only required a mere cumulative 16 minutes of screen time to earn his Best Actor award for this role).  The viewer can't help but ask themselves why we (and Clarice) are all attracted to this charming man who eats people for fun.<br /><br />This movie has a well-deserved place in history, and it chills the viewer well, even a decade after its original release.</p></body></html>

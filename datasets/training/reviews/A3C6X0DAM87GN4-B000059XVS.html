In fact there's no need at all to make that statement. I'm not telling you anything you don't already know. Actually there's nothing I could say about this movie that hasn't been said 100 times before. I can't offer anything new or insightful. I can merely join the hopefully (?) hundreds and upon hundreds of people who love this movie.<p> Released in 1962 and directed by David Lean, the man many people think of as the master of the epic through such films as "Doctor Zhivago" and "Bridge on the River Kwai" (Which also won "Best Picture") "Lawrence of Arabia" is perhaps Lean's most popular and influential film. It is a piece of great story telling. And to think this was one of Peter O' Toole's first roles (In the credits it states "introducing" which usualy means an actor\actress first film. But if you go on IMDB.com it states it was his third movie.). It is a tour-de-force performance. Truly amazing and it honestly should have gotten him the Oscar. It's a shame he's never won, except for the special Oscar that he was awarded.<p> "Lawrence of Arabia" is based on actually writings of T.E. Lawrence. The screenplay by Robert Bolt abd Michael Wilson does in fact remain truthful too many moments. Which is unusualy for a Hollywood movie.<p> Also part of this all-star cast is Alec Guinnes, Anthony Quinn, Omar Sharif, Jose Ferrer, & Claude Rains.<p> Like I said before I really can't offer anything new to say but, just please make an attempt too see this film if you haven't. It will turn out to be a worthwhile experience. This is one of the greatest films of all-time. Nominated for 10 Academy Awards the movie won 7.<p> Bottom-line: One of the greatest films of all-time. And one of many masterpieces to come from director David Lean.</p></body></html>

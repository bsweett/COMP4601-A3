<meta name="summary" content="Not amazing, but worthy of the name: Indiana Jones!"></head><body><p>Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull brings to the screen Hollywood's most well known archaeologist in his latest adventure.<br />Twenty years after his legendary run-ins with the Germans while on archaeological digs, things have changed quite a bit with WWII coming and going, and the Soviets having made their appearance. So it is during the Cold War era that Indiana Jones embarks on a journey to Peru, South America in an effort to uncover the secret of a mysterious crystal skull which legend has it holds the secret to unprecedented power.<br />Harrison Ford, Cate Blanchett, John Hurt, Karen Allen, and the rest of the cast, have carried out their performances very well, though, Shia LaBeouf was a poor choice for the role of Mutt Williams (just as he had been in Transformers).<br />Regarding the specifics, Harrison Ford's age really shows and naturally enough he is rather frail compared to his old self which is difficult to swallow. Moreover, it is not that easy to adjust to a post-WWII setting without the Germans around and with 1950's fashion and Rock and Roll all about. Finally, laying the foundation for a younger adventurer to replace Indy is a good thing in keeping the saga going and quite sad for seeing the end of an era approaching.<br />The acting, the setting, the plot, the special effects, and the music are all wonderful and along with the mystery that accompanies this film will keep you on your toes throughout the entire movie.<br />In short, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is a movie definitely worth watching as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment, though it will probably produce a lot of nostalgia for the younger, more sturdy, Indiana Jones that we have grown to know and love, and the years gone by. 4.5 Stars</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An invigorating movie not easily forgotten"></head><body><p>This was my weekend for non-linear movies, as I saw both this film and "The Grudge" on DVD.  The latter film was pretty good, but "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" really stood out for me.  It had the usual Charlie Kaufman cleverless (actually, this is probably his MOST clever screenplay to date), but that trademark cleverness was- more so than ever before- acting in the service of some very human, emotional themes.  By the way, a concise little 11-minute "making of"/cast & crew interview piece (one of the DVD extras) nicely sums up those themes for those who don't easily get their arms around offbeat, non-linear fare like this.  But honestly, the movie isn't all that hard to follow and understand, so don't let it scare you off.</p></body></html>

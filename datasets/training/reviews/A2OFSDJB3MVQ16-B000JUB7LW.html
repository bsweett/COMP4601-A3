<meta name="summary" content="Cruise and co anchor this "Samurai""></head><body><p>Many of the reviewers liken this movie to "Dances With Wolves" but though there are some similiarites, the main difference is in the main character played by Tom Cruise. I'm not always an avid fan of him and that has nothing to do with his Scientology views but this ranks as one of his best performances as a damaged Civil War vet who regains a sense of self when he encounters the Japanese culture--in particular, bushido.  Ken Watanabe is also excellent in his first starring English role and I think he was nominated for an Oscar if I'm not mistaken.  Being Asian I was entranced by Zwick's sensitive direction and also by the stunning photography.  If you can get this in Hi-Def (HD-DVD or Blu-ray), I would recommend it particularly since the HD DVD price is below $10!!</p></body></html>

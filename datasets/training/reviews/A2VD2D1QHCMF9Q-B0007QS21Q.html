<meta name="summary" content="Nonsense!"></head><body><p>This movie could have been more than it was.  The evolution of robots into laborers appears to be within the grasp of modern technology, and robots beginning to take control of the humans who made them is already here . . like in space travel or microsurgery where people are unable to take manual control of the process  . . .  This concept goes back to RUR, the Czech play of decades ago, but, in any case, this version dissolved into a juvenile shoot-em-up.  Instead of a thoughtful presentation of robots and their potential dangerous side effects, an examination of the advantages and disadvantages of these mechanical workers, it becomes a trivialized and stereotypical piece of nonsense, with the nasty corporate leader, the pretty but skeptical female scientist, the crusty and unbelieving police captain, and the hero, who survives in spite of himself.</p></body></html>

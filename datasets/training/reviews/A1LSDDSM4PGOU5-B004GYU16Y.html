<meta name="summary" content="wall to wall action (4.5/5)"></head><body><p>my friend and i thoroughly enjoyed Salt from the get go.it's basically wall to wall action.yes there are no doubt plot holes,and logic gaps,but it's all about the action here.and it's so much fun.plus it's so fast paced,you don't really have time to think about logic or plot,unless you really want to.we just went with it and had a blast.and actually the story is generally well written and has some very clever sequences.if you can just turn your brain off for the allotted run time,you should really enjoy yourself.but if you need you movies to have a high degree of logic and realism,this likely isn't your cup of tea.for me, though,i loved it. 4.5/5</p></body></html>

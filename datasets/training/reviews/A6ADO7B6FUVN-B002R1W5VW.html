<meta name="summary" content="Obsessive Compulsive Nicholas Cage in Terrific Con-Drama"></head><body><p>Ridley Scott has directed several block buster films such as Alien (1979), Blade Runner (1982), and Black Hawk Down (2002). Scott displays his talent for creating real characters in his films, which he refined in Thelma and Louise (1991). In Matchstick Men Scott pushes himself even further into the human psyche as the main character, Roy Waller (Nicholas Cage), is dealing with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).<br /><br />The con-artist Roy Waller suffers from OCD as he goes about his daily business swindling innocent people with his partner Frank Mercer (Sam Rockwell). Accidentally Roy drops his medication in the sink and goes into a cleaning frenzy as his OCD begins to run amok. Frank begins to worry about Roy and connects him with a psychiatrist. Through therapy Roy improves and soon he finds out that he has a daughter from a previous marriage. Roy is forced to deal with his OCD as he is about to confront his 14-year-old daughter he has never seen, and simultaneously pulls off the biggest con of his life before early retirement.<p>The story of Matchstick Men has been told before, but here is retold with a new twist. The new twist circulates around the psychological disorder that Nicholas Cage presents through wonderful acting. In addition, the cinematography projects a visual abstraction of the psychological disorder of Nicholas Cage's character, which enhances the visual experience. Scott also displays clues and hints of what is to come through detailed mise-en-scene. In the end, Matchstick Men offers a good, but not unique cinematic experience.</p></body></html>

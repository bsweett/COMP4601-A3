<meta name="summary" content="The Sound of Heaven"></head><body><p>The Sound of Music, as far as I am concerned, is a most perfectly-written, acted, scored and crafted film of all time. It is a gem, a jewel, a diadem in the crown of musical cinema.<br /><br />This wonderful movie, beloved and familiar to so many, comes with a series of extra features that deepen one's appreciation for this excellent film. The making of TSOM is told through interviews with the film's stars, its director Robert Wise, and others intimate with the film's development. It was fun watching these Hollywood pros dance around the evident awfulness of the stage version of the movie; fascinating to see how Christopher Plummer brought humanity to the otherwise uni-dimensional role of Captain von Trapp; horrifying to imagine the misplacement of songs in the stage play ("Raindrops on Roses" sung by Mother Superior?) and heavenly to realize their perfect placement in the film. The very 1960s filmlet, starring Charmian Carr (Liesl) as a young ing&eacute;nue in Strausburg, was eye-rollingly innocent and a neat behind-the-scenes view of the filming.<br /><br />TSOM is cloyingly sweet and schmaltzy to some, and a deliriously joyful extravaganza to others. To those who love it for its spirit, for its exuberant and uplifting music or for its cinematic excellence, this DVD will provide many happy viewings.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Stephen King is wrong: this movie is great"></head><body><p>Is there a creepier movie than The Shining? This much is true: You won't ever want to stay in the real-life hotels again! The Stanley in Estes Park, Colorado, which inspired King while he was here in Colorado, or Timberline Lodge on Mt. Hood, Oregon, which provided the exterior shots.<br /><br />In Mick Martin's movie guide, this is one of the few for which "his" review (admittedly, many of the reviews in the book are compiled from trusted reviewers) disagrees with my own in a big way. Specifically, he alleges that Nicholson's performance "approaches high camp" and that the movie itself is slow.<br /><br />I, on the other hand, appreciate the slow burn and feel it gives us time to watch Jack Torrance slip (back?) into insanity. I've never been a huge fan of Shelley Duvall but each time I watch this I appreciate how she nailed the helpless wife/mother. Scatman Crothers (head chef and fellow "Shiner") is great.<br /><br />Taking one star away for the deplorable lack of extras, although I imagine they've corrected that on the newer (Blu-ray?) release.</p></body></html>

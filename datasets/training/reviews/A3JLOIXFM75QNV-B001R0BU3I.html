You can't really discuss this film without giving anything away-and there are some confusing aspects about it in general but overall it was a pretty cool suspence/action film.  Don Cheadle gives a decent performance as a devoutly religious man who it seems has taken up with terrorists in the Middle East. The film actually takes you across the world to different countries where events take place that all lead up to the interesting climax. I can't really say it was that predictable but it wasn't completely inventive either. I think it's better if you don't know too much going into it-I'm glad I didn't since it all seemed that more mysterious.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good Introduction to the Franchise"></head><body><p>The original terminator would not say is the greatest sci-fi movie ever but nonetheless a decent introduction to the franchise.  It is pretty interesting and the sci-fi effects are good but of course nothing like T-2.  I know that the sci-fi movie business was just getting going in the mid 80's so I am not criticizing the movie on behalf of that.  If your a fan of the terminator movies and have not seen it be sure to do so but otherwise look towards T-2, or T-3 for a more impressive sci-fi viewing experience.<br /><br />Peter J.

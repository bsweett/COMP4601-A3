<meta name="summary" content="Possibly Eastwood's finest work to date"></head><body><p>Clint Eastwood's companion piece to "Flags of Our Fathers" may be the director's finest work to date. In telling the story of the battle of Iwo Jima from the point of view of the Japanese, Eastwood is sympathetic to the soldiers whose attempt to defend the island is doomed, but with the exception of one scene, does so without vilifying the American troops who succeeded where the Japanese failed.<br /><br />The film succeeds by personalizing the war for the men who fought it. Whatever one thinks of their cause, these men are motivated by the same patriotic forces as the Americans, and are simply doing what they believe is just. After all, wars are planned and manipulated by men who never set foot on the battlefield. Even the most heroic soldiers, regardless of the country from which they hail, fight in service to interests that benefit the business community more than their country.<br /><br />Eastwood's one false and manipulative move is a scene in which two Japanese deserters are cold-bloodly gunned down by Americans. This is in stark contrast to an earlier moment when an American held hostage by the opposition is treated respectfully by his captors. The latter scene is an admirable attempt to humanize the enemy but is unnecessary since the film has already successfully countered the smirking and monstrous stereotypes of the Japanese that were promoted by Hollywood during and shortly after World War II. The barbarism we witness from the Americans, however, whether accurate or not, seems like sop meant to appeal to the anti-American sentiments expressed as a result of our invasion of Iraq.<br /><br />Technically, "Letters from Iwo Jima" is faultless. Tom Stern's cinematography is appropriately murky, and the imagery striking. The performances are all superb, especially from Ken Watanabe as General Kuribayashi, Kazunari Nonomiya as Saigo, and Tsuyoshi Ihara as Baron Nishi. The screenplay by Iris Yamahita and Paul Haggis is compact, and nicely interweaves scenes of the men's earlier civilian life with their dreary existence awaiting certain death. The music score by Kyle Eastwood and Michael Stevens is haunting and subtle<br /><br />The extras are a little skimpy but include some interesting behind-the-scenes information, some footage from the premiere at Budokan, and a press conference featuring Eastwood and his exceptional cast. The latter provides an opportunity to learn more about players who, with the exception of Watanabe, are unknown in the U.S.<br /><br />Brian W. Fairbanks</p></body></html>

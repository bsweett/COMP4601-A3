<meta name="summary" content="Another arsty fartsy film based on unbelievable characters."></head><body><p>I've noticed a lot of these "dramas" that everyone raves over as being such a great answer to soulless, Hollywood, action and special effects movies are really just dull, pretentious, artsy fartsy nonsense.  The thing that reveals this movie to be another example of this is the fact that the characters in it just don't behave in a remotely believable fashion.  Julia Roberts' character hooks up first with a man who she learns went to an aquarium to meet her after having cybersex with someone he thought was her the night before (what kind of women are attracted to desperate perverts?).  She then dumps him for a stalker whose followed her around for a year.  Then she dumps the stalker and gets back with Mr. Cybersex after he grovels for her.  What man ever won a woman by grovelling?  What woman ever did anything but hold a man in contempt after he grovelled?  I may not be the world's foremost expert on women, but I do know that women are just plain not attracted to men they don't respect.  And what person respects a grovelling beggar?  Begging and grovelling KILLS attraction.  This character's behavior is so contrary to reality it just kills suspension of belief stone dead.<br /><br />Clive Owen's character grovels and begs for this woman after he learns that she was seeing someone else when he married her, and is now throwing him over for this man.  In other words, the evident fact that she never really loved him, and has been deceiving him over an extended period doesn't seem to upset him all that much.<br /><br />Jude Law's character Grovels in turn for both Julia Roberts' and Natalie Portmans' character, though more realistically he ultimately loses them both.<br /><br />And Natalie Portman can apparently forgive Jude Law for cheating on her, lying to her, and dumping her for another woman, crawling back only after he's lost the other woman.  That's not too much for her.  But apparently she can't forgive him for asking her if she had sex with Clive Owen's character.<br /><br />Excuse me?<br /><br />Do real people act like this?  Not in the world I've lived in all my life they don't.  So how is it good drama to portray people so unbelievably?  I'm sorry, I just can't see what critics find so enchanting about films like this.  The only thing this movie has going for it are first rate actors, and that's not enough to save it.</p></body></html>

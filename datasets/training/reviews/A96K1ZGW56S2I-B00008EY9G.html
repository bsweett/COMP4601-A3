However, as one begins watching the film, you are swept up into the movie's engaging plot.  As a thriller, it's great and as a thriller with a twist it's one of the most original to come around in a long time.  IDENTITY revolves around 10 people who all become stranded at the same creepy motel on a dark and story night. Somehow contected to all of this is the hearing concerning a bald-headed mass murderer. This hearing doesn't come into play much, but has a very important connection to the rest of the movie.  Anyway, back at the ranch, I mean, hotel.  One by one the people at the hotel start dieing. Everyone becomes suspicious of everyone else until no one has a clue to what's going on.  Things get wierder and wierder until the film's climax and all the loose ends are tied up.  However, even then things aren't what they seem to be.  IDENTITY is an interesting movie.  It was a bit better than I thought it was going to be, and the fine performance of the cast (especially John Cusack) and the great freshly-original screenplay made the film better.  It's a nice movie to watch with someone on a rainy night.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Interpreter  (2005)"></head><body><p>Director:  Sydney Pollack<br /><br />Cast:  Nicole Kidman, Sean Penn, Catherine Keener, Jesper Christensen, Yvan Attal, Earl Cameron, George Harris, Michael Wright.<br /><br />Running Time:  129 minutes<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for language and some violence.<br /><br />Who knew Sydney Pollack still had it in him? Pollack, the veteran director behind "Out of Africa," returns to the thriller genre that served him so well with hits like "Three Days of the Condor" and "The Firm." In recent years, Pollack's output has repeatedly flatlined ("Random Hearts"), but that changes with "The Interpreter," a relatively, smartly mounted thriller.  A 71 year-old man in what has unfortunately become a young person's business, Pollack uses his years of patience and respect for the audience to help maintain his picture's pace and reluctance to spell things out; "Interpreter" isn't some gaudy, ridiculously half-baked piece of pop film-making. While it clearly relishes its thrills, the picture is a much more restrained experience that leans heavily on character exploration and tension than on goofball money shots.<br /><br />One late night while retrieving some personal items, United Nations African interpreter Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman) accidentally overhears an assassination plot involving a controversial African dignitary in town for a visit. Calling for protection, Silvia meets F.B.I. Agent Tobin Keller (Sean Penn), who initially sees Silvia as a threat, but quickly comprehends that there is more to this story than she's letting on. Fearful for her own life, yet reluctant to give Keller all the facts, Silvia finds herself in a hurricane of intrigue as the days count down to the dignitary's volatile appearance.  As Keller gets closer and closer to the truth behind Silvia's estranged past and the essence of her involvement in the U.N., he must also determine the best course of action to keep Silvia alive and ensure the safety of the United Nations all at once.<br /><br />Kidman has one of the best opportunities in her distinguished career to shine; shifting from being a possessed, driven woman who wants to ensure the safety of the U.N. and a paranoid schizophrenic whose prime concern is her own personal wellbeing.  Sean Penn, on the other hand, plays a Keller a man suffering from insomnia. He gives a mannered reading to this man that can't accept what fate has dealt him and appears to be sleep walking in most of his scenes. While being not one of Penn's most felicitous appearances in front of the camera, one wonders if it was because of problems with the director, or just a lapse in Mr. Pollack's judgment about this character.  The international cast put together responds well to the director. One casualty is the enormously talented Catherine Keener, who has little to do. Jesper Christensen, Yvan Attal, Earl Cameron and George Harris are seen in minor roles.  Pollack has always constructed films beautifully and "The Interpreter" is no exception; however, the film lags frequently and the innuendo between Silvia and Keller seems fairly redundant and below the standard of such a fine director.  A good, yet not great film from a director the film industry is glad to have back on board.</p></body></html>

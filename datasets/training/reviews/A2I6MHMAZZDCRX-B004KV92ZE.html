<meta name="summary" content="The Panda of Destiny?"></head><body><p>Our story centers around Po the Panda (voiced by Jack Black).  He is a Kung Fu legend.  Evildoers fear him and the people adore him.  The Fearsome Five long to fight with him.  And everything...hold on, maybe that isn't the way it really is.<br /><br />In reality, Po works in his father's noodle restaurant waiting tables.  He's way overweight and out of shape.  But he dreams about Kung Fu and idolizes the Fearsome Five, Monkey (Jackie Chan), Crane (David Cross), Tigress (Angelina Jolie) Viper (Lucy Liu), and Mantis (Seth Rogen).  That's why, when it is announced that the legendary Dragon Warrior will soon be chosen, Po leaves everything behind and joins the rest of the village high up the mountain.<br /><br />Through a series of events, Po winds up being named the Dragon Warrior, much to the dismay of the Fearsome Five and Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) who must train the rookie.  Po doesn't think he can do it, but he doesn't want to quit.  Shifu and the Five want to make him quit.  But they'd better figure things out soon because an old foe is about to return to the village intent on destroying it.  Can Po save the day?<br /><br />Since I'm not a fan of Jack Black or Dreamworks Animation, I almost skip this flick.  And that would have been a huge mistake.  This is a fun movie for all ages.<br /><br />So let's get the obvious and the only negative out of the way right now, shall we?  We've seen this plot many, many times before.  But the movie does a great job of making the familiar ride enjoyable.<br /><br />Part of that is through the humor.  There are lots of great one liners and slap stick scenes.  It's not side splitting funny, but I laughed plenty of times.  And some of the gags were completely unexpected.  Yet the more serious and tender moments don't feel forced in the slightest.  And the story is fast paced with an ending that made me smile.<br /><br />The first few minutes are hand drawn animation, but the rest of the movie is computer animated.  It looked amazing with plenty of beautiful settings and small details.  They even managed to do a good job with the Kung Fu fight scenes.  Heck, they were easier to follow than fight scenes in many of the live action movies made these days.<br /><br />I always worry when I hear that a movie has a voice cast made up of famous people, but here they did a good job becoming the characters.  I wasn't left picturing the actor recording the voice.  Instead, I bought the characters and got lost in the story.<br /><br />Okay, so this movie isn't highly original.  It's still incredibly fun.  And that's all that matters.  I'm glad I gave the movie a chance.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Funny Because... it's true..."></head><body><p>Dr. Strangelove, like most black comedy, finds its humor in the fact that there is really very little humor to be found in the situation it presents.<br /><br />Mankind, in trying to secure peace (through Mutally Assured Destruction-type nuclear deterrence), manages to completely bungle every step, accidentally dropping a hydrogen bomb and causing the triggering of a Doomsday Device which will force us to live in caves for a hundred years.<br /><br />What's funny about that? Nothing. And, of course, everything.<br /><br />The funny thing about it is that it's so true--humanity really is that inept and bumbling; we really could "oops" our way into a nuclear winter--and we're left with the options of laugh about it or give up in despair. Movies like Dr. Strangelove allow us to see the ridiculousness that we continually create and "find the funny" rather than anguish.<br /><br />Specifically, we're shown the hyper-paranoid mentality of the Cold War, with all of its suffocating rules and fail-safes (with the eventual result that no one is able to call back the planes sent to bomb Russia, because no one has the proper authorization). Hilariously, though, we're shown that the paranoia has a *basis*, as the Russian Ambassador snaps spy-photos of "the Big Board" when the Doomsday Device has already been triggered and surely such espionage has lost all meaning. We're shown how our well-meaning public officials (represented by the President) are at the mercy of testosterone-fueled, cereberally-challenged Generals and insane scientists culled from Hitler's government (with the Nazi inside always threatening to come out).<br /><br />Dr. Strangelove, amidst the backdrop of the Cold War and nuclear arms race, shows how humanity, in everything it does or tries to do, always manages to muck things up in the most hideously, and appropriately, ironic of ways. ("Peace Is Our Profession" read the signs of the Air Force Base, as the gunfire rings out and the bombers fly towards their targets.) Dr. Strangelove tells us to accept all of this, smile, and "stop worrying."<br /><br />Beyond the general purpose of black comedy, and Dr. Strangelove's particular topic, this is a wonderful film. Brilliantly acted, brilliantly directed. Peter Sellers is, as you think he might be, a stand-out, wonderful in all three of his roles (and the first two times I watched this movie, I couldn't even tell that all three were the same man), and so is George C. Scott and the rest of the supporting cast.<br /><br />This is my favorite of Kubrick's collection and my favorite black comedy.<br /><br />As one final note for this five-star comedy, I wonder if Dr. Strangelove will, over time, lose its appeal to the newer generations. They will not have grown up during the Cold War, and they will have missed out on that era's particular fear of and obsession with The Bomb. Perhaps, if Dr. Strangelove loses its relevance and appeal to succeeding generations, that will be a good thing and signal progress? We can only hope for the best.</p></body></html>

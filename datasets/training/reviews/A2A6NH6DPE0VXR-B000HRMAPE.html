The 2nd film was just a Tom Cruise show where we watch him show off by doing spin kicks and do cartoonish stunts. Although J.J Abrams directs this film like he's doing an episode of Alias, he still knows how to do a Mission Impossible film better than John Woo. He at least lets Tom give one of his better recent performances on top of having some really great stunts in the film. While MI 2 was mostly just one big stunt show. This film at least has a story and some edge of seat suspense. Although I liked part 2, I can't say that watching Tom ride a motcycle while blowing up cars with a hand gun in part 2 was that exciting. That was more of a look at me I'm Tom Cruise film.<br /><br />  This film is so much more than just a look at me I'm Tom Cruise film. He at least has a team that gets some action and get to actually shine a little. For once Ving Rhames even gets more to do and developed more than he was in the other films. Here he helps out Ethan and gets more lines. Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Maggie Q are also good as two members of Ethan's team. I also liked seeing Simon Pegg from Shaun of the Dead in a role. Although his character is way too much like Marshal in Alias. The whole building where Ethan works even looks  like somewhere Sydney Bristow would work. I almost even expected either Sydney or Jack Bristow to walk in the building.<br /><br />  The whole way the film is put together is like an Alias episode too. In the beginning we see Ethan and his wife tied up and being threatened by Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman). He threatens to kill her if Ethan doesn't tell him where something called "the Rabbits foot" is. Anyway then the film shows everything that lead up to that point. It's like the first episode of Alias where she's tied up and a torturer is threatening to pull out all her teeth. Then it it flashes back to everything that lead up to it. I don't really mind him directing the film as if he is doing an episode of Alias though since I always found Alias to be a fun Mission Impossible rip-off anyway. Plus he's more fitting to do the movies than John Woo. Don't get me wrong, I like Woo but Mission Impossible isn't meant to be all brainless action.<br /><br />  I also love the fact that we also actually see them make a mask of someone elses face. In the other films we just see Ethan pretend to be someone else and just pull the face off to reveil it to be him. So at least now we know they just don't carry spare faces around lol. I just loved this movie and couldn't keep my eyes off it and it totally brings the series back after the 2nd one let so many people down.<br /><br />  The only thing I don't like about it is the overly happy ending after the rest of the film was so gripping and violent it doesn't really work. Plus the film centers so much around Ethan getting married and doing the job too when I doubt he'll even be married in the 4th film. While Tom and Ving talk a lot about marriage in this one, I already picture them talking about divorces in the 4th film lol. I mean he was supposed to love Thandie Newton's character so much in the 2nd one and here he doesn't even mention her once.</p></body></html>

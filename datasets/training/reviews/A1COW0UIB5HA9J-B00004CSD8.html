<meta name="summary" content="Poor carbon copy"></head><body><p>US politician Robert Thorn (Liv Sieber) and his wife Katherine (Julia Stiles) just had their baby while visiting Italy but it turns out their baby just died so in turn a Catholic priest named Father Spiletto (Giovanni Lombardo Radice) gave them an orphaned baby who's mom died in birth. 5 years later in London where their adopted son Damien (Seamus Davey-Fritzpatrick) lives with them and they hire a nanny named Mrs. Blaylock (Mia Farrow) to watch over him sometimes but it turns out some strange and bizarre things have occured over the last 4 days, it turns out that their adopted child could be the son of the Devil.<br /><br />A pointless and dumb remake of a 70s classic! it's preciously the same movie with an few small changes like the monkey-house at the zoo but mainly it's a shot-to-shot script-by-script carbon copy much like that horrible Psycho remake from 1998. The acting feels flat exception being Mia Farrow and Giovanni Lombardo Radice (aka John Morghen of Italian horror explotation fame) and there's nothing scary about it like the original. It just feels like one epic fail here as i should say that some movies like the original and Psycho just don't need improving upon and if their plan of attack is to remake an already successful original by using a shot-to-shot script-by-script carbon copy clone remake then don't be surprise when they fail miserably, if we wanted to see the original movie we'd watch it. Plain and simple.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray contains very good picture and sound with extras being featuretes, a BD exclusive known as "Devil Tracks", commentary and trailers.</p></body></html>

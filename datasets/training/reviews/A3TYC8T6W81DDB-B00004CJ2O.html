<meta name="summary" content="The Legend Begins Here"></head><body><p>In 1980, Steve Christy has decided to re-open Camp Crystal Lake, otherwise known as Camp Blood. A young boy drowned in '57 and a double murder followed the year after.  They have about two weeks before camp starts, so all of his counselors are beginning to show up to help get the camp ready. But when the counselors begin getting picked off one by one, it seems as though the same fate that cursed Camp Blood over twenty years ago still plagues the camp to this very day.<br /><br />I don't like this film as much as other Friday the 13th fans seem to. I realize it's the original and it started the franchise, but I feel like something is missing. As much of a Jason fan that I am, I always viewed this one as the one in the franchise missing the key ingredient. That has always kinda made me overlook this film until I'm finally sitting down and watching it.  The uncut version is a bit of a tease as I think with the uncut scenes we get an extra eight to ten seconds of extended footage of a few of the kills. It's nice to see the best parts of the film the way they were meant to be seen, but it won't make me rush out and buy the new DVD at full price. I'll wait for the price to go down or find a used copy at a more reasonable price. I'm not taking anything away from this film though. It's still a lot of fun and I enjoy it. I'm just a sucker for Jason, I guess.<br /><br />Rating - 6.5/10</p></body></html>

I bought the DVD the day it came out without having seen it before for I felt that this would be a good movie! my kind of movie! and it truly was. I love this movie!! Two friends, Marie and Alexa go home to Alexa's home for a little getaway. That night, a sadistic killer knocks on the door. Alexa's father opens the door and the horror begins. The madman kills Alexa's father and mother ( Cool death scenes!! ) and then takes Alexa hostage. Meanwhile, Marie is witness to all this madness and the killer does not realize that he left one victim behind as Marie was hiding from him and wasn't found. She then follows his van to try to save her friend and the thrills and suspense begin. If you are a gore fan, you will love this movie. Plenty of blood and gore!! Well acted, well written and well directed. For gore fans, you are in for a treat with the circular saw scene! ( which is my favorite scene in the movie ). Cool Cool scene. Although the ending to this film is confusing, it does not take away from the great horror film that this is. I sure hope there is a High Tension 2 in the works!!!! A must see for horror movie fans!!!!!!! Loved it!</p></body></html>

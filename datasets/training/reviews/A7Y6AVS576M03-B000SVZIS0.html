<meta name="summary" content="Ape Lincoln"></head><body><p>Looking at this film objectively and trying not to make any comparisons to the original I found it to be just run of the mill science fiction filmmaking. The story and character development is very minimal. Since we have all become such sophisticated filmgoers over the years, the denouement is predictable and is somewhat just unimpressive. Mark Wahlberg as astronaut Davidson is convincing and likeable. Tim Roth as the brutal adversarial ape Thade is convincing and dislikeable. The real culprits here are uninspired Tim Burton's direction and a very bland script by Mark Rosenthal, Lawrence Konner and William Broyles Jr. Composer Danny Elfman's score is nondescript. One standout element is Philippe Rousselot's artistically alluring yet gritty cinematography.</p></body></html>

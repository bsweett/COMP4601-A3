<meta name="summary" content="Good Matador, great Brosnan"></head><body><p>After watching "The Matador," I couldn't help but feel that Pierce Brosnan must feel some relief. No doubt he enjoyed his days - and paychecks, as James Bond.  But as an actor he must of felt at times as if he were encased in amber.  What the "Matador" illustrates, without doubt, is that Brosnan has some serious acting chops.  With his world weary wrinkles, salt and pepper hair, Brosnan is no longer the super precise and super neat Remington Steele. What you have instead, due to all this natural seasoning, is a very convincing - in a black comedy way--performance as the burned out assassin Julian Noble.  (One has to think the Coen brothers might soon be giving Brosnan a call.)  Perverse, a bit kooky, drunk, lonely, and funny as hell, Noble is all of the above, but he will kill you - for a price.<br /><br />But where "The Matador" succeeds as a showcase for one actor's fine performance, it somewhat limps along as far as a story goes. The first half, which takes place in Mexico, is superb.  The weakest part of the story is the Greg Kinnear/Hope Davis portion of the movie, which comes to dominate the last half of the film.  The script goes to great lengths to establish a foundation for what is to come in the second half of the movie between Kinnear (as businessman Danny Wright (get it?), and Noble.  But for some reason this never really takes off.  If anything, Kinnear's sporting of a newly grown mustache (in imitation of his assassin friend?) has me recalling a wide-eyed Michael J. Fox.  And Hope Davis going potty mouthed upon meeting Noble, didn't seem to serve much purpose.  Maybe this is just a case of an overwhelming performance swamping the intended script.  But the script does demand a level of balance between Wright and Noble, but what the movie shows is that Brosnan is truly the lone wolf in this bunch.  Everything else seems simply tacked on</p></body></html>

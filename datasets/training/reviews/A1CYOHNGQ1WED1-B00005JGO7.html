<meta name="summary" content="A wild ride through London's underworld"></head><body><p>The plot of Snatch is hard to explain, but while you're watching the movie it's not hard to follow. There are two story lines that eventually cross each other. Two low-level boxing promoters, Turkish and Tommy, get in trouble with a nasty mobster called Brick Top who likes to feed people to his pigs. Brad Pitt plays an incomprehensible Irish gypsy bare knuckle fighter who boxes for Turkish after putting Turkish's boxer in the hospital. His one problem is that instead of taking a dive as instructed, he knocks his opponent out with one punch.<br /><br />In the other story, Benicio del Toro steals an 86 carat diamond in Belgium, then comes to London to give it to a man named Doug whose American cousin, played by Dennis Farina, is waiting for it.  However, there is a Russian named Boris the Blade who hires two pawn shop owners to steal it for him. Dennis Farina has to leave the states and come to London to find his diamond with the help of a man named Bullet Toothed Tony. The diamond changes hands several times and then there's the cute little dog who eats a squeak toy so he squeaks every time he barks.<br /><br />Eventually the two story lines cross several times and it all makes sense in the end. Snatch is a fast paced movie with a fair amount of violence and humor. The overall story is clever and the characters are wild and varied. If you enjoy movies like Pulp Fiction, you'd probably like Snatch.</p></body></html>

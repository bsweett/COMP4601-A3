When it originally aired on NBC-TV between 1966 and 1969, it did no better than No. 35 in the Nielsen ratings, and was cancelled by NBC at the end of the '68-'69 season. But then a funny thing happened in the 1970s: Syndication. It was syndication that bought "Star Trek" a renewed following, making it a massive cult favorite whose followers came to be known as "Trekkies." It was only a matter of time before the series made the leap from the small screen to the big screen. That happened in December 1979. <p>William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, Nichelle Nichols, James Doohan, and Walter Koenig were reunited for what turned out to be the first of many successful "Star Trek" movies. And while this initial entry is somewhat imperfect, it nevertheless shows a fair amount of style.<p>The film focuses on the crew of a now-redesigned U.S.S. Enterprise, once more commanded by James Kirk (Shatner), heading out to confront a vast alien cloud making its way towards Earth on a mission of destruction. Shatner this time also runs into conflict with the new "Enterprise" commander (Stephen Collins) over his usurping of authority. But for the most part, the differences are put aside to confront this hideous threat to Earth's population. The alien force, which calls itself "V'ger", has taken over the body of one of the "Enterprise"'s medical officers (Persis Khambatta). As the crew learns, "V'ger" is in actuality an ancient "Voyager" space probe launched from Earth three centuries ago. It now makes what is obviously quite an impossible demand to meet: either it reunites with its "Creator", or it wipes out the "Creator"'s planet--Earth.<p>Originally budgeted at five million dollars by Paramount Pictures when production started in mid-1977, the size and scope of STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE grew very fast; and as a result, so too did the budget until it came out to a then nearly-unheard-of forty million. Much of that budget, not surprisingly, was spent on production design and the wide array of special effects. On that score, STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE certainly looks every bit like it. And having a veteran director like Robert Wise, who made films like WEST SIDE STORY, THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, THE HAUNTING, and THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN didn't hurt either. But the slow, leisurely pace of the film did turn off many filmgoers, even some Trekkies; in that sense, it closely resembles 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY more than it does, say, STAR WARS, let alone the original TV series. But even that can be a plus, because the series was not merely concerned with fancy visuals; it was concerned with deep human issues, and the movie itself concerns itself with an issue as old as humanity itself--God, or, The Creator.<p>The ultra-familiar cast was one of the reasons that STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE was a box office smash, despite its flaws. Another reason, of course, was the superb visual effects work supervised by Douglas Trumbull, John Dykstra and Richard Yuricich, which got nominated for an Oscar. The other high point of the film is Jerry Goldsmith's magnificent music score, with echoes of Debussy's "Nocturnes" and parts of Holst's "The Planets"; it is easily one of the greatest music scores produced in Hollywood during the last four decades that John Williams did NOT compose, and it too was recognized with an Oscar nomination.<p>Despite its extreme length (at 144 minutes) and somewhat slow pace, STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE is still eminently watchable on all counts, and comes highly recommended for all science fiction film fans, even those who are not necessarily Trekkies.</p></body></html>

They were about to shoot him and he didn't bat an eye."<br /><br />"Well I suppose if you were about to be shot, there isn't a great deal you can do is there?"<br /><br />The Film<br /><br />The prison film genre is full of cliche.  We know there will be resistance, there will be punishment and comradery. Its been done to death at this point.  Many of those cliches came from Bridge on the River Kwai.  Even The Great Escape owes more than a few tricks to the David Lean Classic of 1957.  Heck even Star Trek VI stole Saito's opening speech for the Klingon Gulag scene.  We know the story:  Alec Guiness, the consummate professional officer gives not an inch to Japanese commander Saito.  Lazy American Holden makes a hero of sorts by the end for the "rescue."  Calling this or the Great Escape on "historical accuracy" is like calling "Predator" a comment on America's involvement in Latin America.  Nope, this is a prison film.  And this prison movie goes the extra mile from latter replicas in the "accurate" story of war it all amounts to.  In a Hemingway-esque turn, they all die in one way or another for a stupid wooden bridge.  Sad and trivial, but epic nonetheless.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray<br /><br />Upgrading from the previous DVD box release is worth it.  Colors are bold without being crushed.  Skin tones are accurate. Blues and greens of the jungle are vibrant and inviting.  Delineation of the jungle light from shade to sun is just beautiful.  There are no crushed blacks here. Early scenes on the train as we enter the jungle are thick with grain, likely from push processing the negative a couple stops or, more likely, the result of optical compositing for the opening credits.  Fear not, the emulsion settles, quickly into a consistent and uniform image.  Lens distortions are easily visible, something I never noticed as much on the DVD and detail is surprisingly good for a 50+ year-old film.  The Bridge on the River Kwai Is a tasty preface to what will hopefully be an equally impressive Blu-Ray for Lean's Lawrence of Arabia.<br /><br />The Film.  5/5<br />The Blu-Ray  4/5</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A cute and tender comedy"></head><body><p>Comedies are not my thing. And anything labeled a romantic comedy has me cringing. But the cast of this film had me curious. Its all actors I admire. And I must say, its a unique type of movie. Its not overly funny and its not really angsty. But it deals with so many different emotions and events, its just great to sit back and enjoy it as a whole. I know this will be one of those Christmas classics that people watch every year.</p></body></html>

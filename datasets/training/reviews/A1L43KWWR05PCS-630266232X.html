From the stark, stylized  chiaroscuro cinematography, which won it an Academy Award in 1944,  to its stellar performances, deft direction, and  intelligent screenplay, it is simply a marvelous film. It was adapted from the novel of the same name by Vera Caspary. To add icing to the cake, there is a haunting musical score that will stay with the viewer long after the final credits have scrolled away.<br /><br />This classic, old-fashioned  murder mystery features a stunning Gene Tierney in the title role and old time favorite Dana Andrews as Detective Lt. Mark McPherson, the hardboiled, virile gumshoe who finds himself smitten the minute he sees the portrait of Laura Hunt at the scene of the crime. He is determined to bring the murderer of this lovely young woman to justice. As have all the men in Laura's life, McPherson, too, becomes obsessed with her.<br /><br />When a major, mind-boggling twist in the plot casts a new light on the evidence,  McPherson goes full speed ahead, as new developments point the finger of suspicion from the least likely to the most likely suspect. Could it be Laura's jealous aunt, Ann Treadwell (Dame Judith Anderson), who seems to be hot to trot with Laura's fiance, Shelby Carpenter (Vincent Price), despite the differences in their respective ages? Could it be Laura's playboy fiance? After all, he has a shady past and a penchant for money and other women, especially those who could keep him in the style to which he would like to become accustomed. Could it even be Laura's long time friend, mentor,  and spurned would be suitor, the acerbic writer and self-styled cynic,  Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb)?<br /><br />Gene Tierney gives a luminous performance as Laura Hunt, the beautiful, intelligent, independent businesswoman who is somewhat of a cipher. She is someone to whom men are drawn, often obsessively so. Dana Andrews is perfect in the role of Detective McPherson. His no nonsense, street smart, hunky detective is a great counterpoint and foil to the more effete and prissy Waldo Lydecker. Clifton Webb is positively brilliant in the role of Waldo Lydecker and steals the show from under the noses of his co-stars. This is no mean feat given the enormous talent of the film's stellar cast. Webb's droll, spot on delivery of the wonderful lines that he was given are memorable.<br /><br />Vincent Price is excellent in the role of Shelby Carpenter, Laura's Callow fiance and erstwhile gigolo. At first, however, he took a little getting used to, as I was used to seeing Vincent Price in roles associated with gothic horror. Still, he acquits himself admirably. Dame Judith Anderson is memorable in the small role of Laura's desperate aunt, Ann Treadwell,  who knows what she wants and will pay whatever price is necessary to get it. Of course, Otto Preminger deserves kudos for his deft direction, as does Samuel Hoffenstein for writing a screenplay infused with such great dialogue. Kudos also go to David Raskin, as his memorable score will forever be loved and remembered by those who enjoy this film.<br /><br />As for the DVD, since I paid what seemed to be a rock bottom price for it, I assumed that it would be problematic in terms of quality. Instead, I got a wonderful DVD with an excellent print transfer, as both the visuals and the audio were clear and of good quality. The DVD is also loaded with extras that are unheard of in a DVD of this price. There are two worthwhile commentaries provided. There are also two versions of  the film to view. One is an extended version that contains an alternate opening scene. The DVD also contains two great A & E  biographies. One is of Gene Tierney, and  that other is of Vincent Price. Both will be of interest to all film buffs. This DVD has got to be one of the best values to be found on Amazon, and the film is certainly one that is worthy of a place in one's personal film collection.</p></body></html>

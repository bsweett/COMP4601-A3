<meta name="summary" content="Hilarious!"></head><body><p>Having attended some of the conventions for old television series (Star Trek, Dark Shadows), I could really relate to this movie.  The atmosphere and the attitude of the fans at some of these conventions are captured exactly by the director.<br /><br />In this movie, the actors from on old television series very much like Star Trek, attend a convention.  They are harangued by the fans and peppered with questions about the science in some of the more obscure episodes.  Tim Allen is the William Shatner like character of the series and he meets some weird "fans" that ask him for help.  Tim laughingly agrees.  What he doesn't realize is that these are not fans but in actuality real aliens that think Allen is his persona in the TV series.  On their planet they do not know what a lie or acting is so they accept Allen's "offer" of help and whisk him to a spaceship in another part of the solar system.<br /><br />Allen then has to convince his co-stars to help the aliens and they agree not realizing what they are up against.  They must battle an alien warlord who is ruthless as Star Trek's Khan.<br /><br />There are some hilarious scenes in this movie that literally had me splitting my sides, especially with the actor who plays the ship's engineer (he is the same actor from the Monk tv series).<br /><br />Much funnier and better conceived than Spaceballs!</p></body></html>

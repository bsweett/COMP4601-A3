<meta name="summary" content="Yes it's really that great"></head><body><p>I only own the old trek movies, none of The Next Generation Movies. The great thing about this movie, is they took a great villain from the old T.V show. And Brought him into the present, I've always thought this movie was the best in the entire series. We get to see Kirk find out he has a son, and briefly reunite with his ex. Plus Spock's sacrafice at the end to save the ship, now I know the next generation tried to recapture this magic in "Nemesis". But failed to recognize, what this movie does. There was history between Khan and Kirk, Kahn was marooned by Kirk on a planet, after he tried to take over the enterprise. But was defeated by Kirk, years later. A scientific expadition, finds Kahn and what's left of his group. He steals the ship, and heads out for revenge. Ending in a head on battle with Kirk, not just once, but twice. And both times being outsmarted by Kirk, a very awsome movie</p></body></html>

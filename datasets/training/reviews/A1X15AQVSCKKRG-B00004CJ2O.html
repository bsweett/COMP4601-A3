<meta name="summary" content="The original and still  the best"></head><body><p>Paramount's Friday the 13th series are weak and underrated,<br /><br />contemplatig the success of the original Paramount decided<br /><br />to use the franchise for all it's worth.<br /><br />One can see with a comedy like Freddy vs. Jason that the<br /><br />mystique was over a long time ago.<br /><br />Of course the original still stands on it's own.<br /><br />Featuring a cast of nobodies like Betsy Palmer, Kevin<br /><br />Bacon and others Sean S. Cunninghma who worked with Wes<br /><br />Craven on Last House on the Left has created<br /><br />a cult classic.<br /><br />Though the idea of a slasher in a teenage camp chopping<br /><br />of sex starved perverts is not original or funny the<br /><br />execution was  there.<br /><br />Of course we have the twists in this movie about Jason<br /><br />Vorhee's mom as a murderer and of couse we Jason<br /><br />Vorheeds before he adopted his trademark hockey mask.<br /><br />This is a still pretty good chilling movie.</p></body></html>

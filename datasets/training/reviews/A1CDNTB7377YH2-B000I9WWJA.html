<meta name="summary" content="Not Your Ordinary Hostage Drama!"></head><body><p>This is a very different hostage/bank robbery drama.  A group of bad guys led by Clive Owen take over a bank in lower Manhattan.  Instead of taking the money and running, Owen's band take all the people in the bank hostages and make them all wear the same uniform and masks that they are wearing (so the cops can't tell the good guys from the bad guys and neither can the hostages too as a matter of fact).  They then make it clear to the police that arrive on the scene outside that they have a hostage situation in the bank.<br /><br />Denzel Washington is called in to be the hostage negotiator for the police.  Washington was recently involved in a scandal that prevented him from getting a promotion.  In the meantime the Bank's CEO (Christopher Plummer) is meeting with Jodie Foster.  Apparently there is something in one of the bank's safe deposit boxes that Plummer wants protected.  This causes Foster to call in some favors (with the mayor and others) so she can be let into the bank without interference from Washington and talk to the bad guys directly.<br /><br />I keep saying this movie is very different.  Firstly you are never too sure what the bad guys want but you suspect it has to do with what Plummer doesn't want them to have.  Also the movie has some interesting directing and story telling which seems to go back and forth between the hostage standoff and interviews with people that were in the bank after everything was resolved.<br /><br />Washington and Owen both give brilliant performances and Willem DaFoe is excellent in a supporting role.  It is a well conceived and brilliantly executed movie.  The only drawback to me is that it was never quite clear how Owen learned what he did about what was in the bank.</p></body></html>

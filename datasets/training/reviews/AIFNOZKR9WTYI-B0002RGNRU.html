<meta name="summary" content="Shotgun entertainment"></head><body><p>This movie seems to want to throw everything at you but the kitchen sink... actually staring at the kitchen sink would have been more entertaining ... and call it entertainment.  The movie had an interesting premise which was clouded and ruined by being over-eventful and consisting of a relationship between a shy man and a woman who clearly has a personality disorder, probably Borderline Personality Disorder.  If this relationship were examined in a more straightforward manner, without all the gags and tricks and minor characters trying to steal the show every second, the raw and bittersweet facts of such a relationship might have been affecting.  I once dated a woman with a similar personality disorder and so I found myself remembering how superficially charming and how difficult to disengage oneself from such people can be.  THIS is an interesting premise.  But it was as if the film-makers did not trust in their own premise enough to leave it to stand on its own feet and instead had to dance around it in such dizzying circles that it was entirely obscured.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A few comments"></head><body><p>I just had a few miscellaneous comments on this very unusual film. I'm usually easily entertained when it comes to movies, because I don't usually expect very much of them (at least the stuff that normally comes out of Hollywood as compared to various independent directors). It's rare that I really rave about a film, but I have to admit I was impressed with how original and unusual this film was. A lot of films are pretty predictable, but this one isn't, and the film had me wondering what kind of wacky and funny hijinx or scene would come up next. But they did just that for the next two hours. The film also playfully explores some pretty profound questions relating to identity, consciousness, the afterlife, and so on. And on top of that there's a kinky scene or two that are pretty over the top just by themselves.<br /><br />Given all the above, I would have to count this as one of the more intelligent, unusual, and funny movies to come out in recent memory. I was a little surprised it had even been produced and come out of Hollywood rather than by an independent director, but shortly after I'd seen the film I heard a brief interview on PBS with the scriptwriter and he said the same thing, that he was surprised when the script was picked up and the studio actually decided to make the film.<br /><br />Also, it's great to see Orson Bean is still working, and actually, I thought he looked pretty good for his age in the movie. I remember from the old days when he appeared on the Johnny Carson show and he called himself a "humorist" rather than a comedian. Well, I'm not sure really what the difference is between humor and comedy, but this movie certainly has them both in spades and it was very obvious he had a lot of fun making the movie too.<br /><br />I very rarely rent movies that I've seen in the theater and see them twice, but I plan on renting this one and watching it again soon, since I haven't seen it since it first came out five years ago. Overall, a very unusual, outrageous, and entertaining film that I suspect will become a cult classic.</p></body></html>

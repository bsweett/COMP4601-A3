Just imagine...those great Alex Raymond-drawn Flash Gordon strips of the forties and thirties come to life in full art deco regalia, aesthetics absolutely perfectly replicated in 3 dimensions, with the perfect casting of Gwyneth Paltrow as a Lois Lane-type reporter, Giovannia Ribisi as Mr. Gadgets and Mr. Matinee Idol himself, Jude Law, as the hero, and you have "Sky Captain & The World of Tomorrow"...a film I KNEW was going to be groundbreaking when it was in the promo stage.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie that is a perfect marriage of major league visuals and suitable acting, and, "Gladiator" aside, is the one film that makes PERFECT use of CGI technology! The entire film was done against a bluescreen, with very few real-world props! There have been other reviews of this film decrying the wooden acting of those involved, but you have to remember that 1) Acting WITH real-world references isn't easy, and 2) These actors were doing their thing WITHOUT real-world references, something I've always appreciated about a good sci-fi or fantasy movie...<br /><br />The story concerns the classic megalomaniacal villain scenario of a mad, but brilliant scientist who has misused his gift to satisfy his own outsized paranoia. Laurence Olivier is digitally resurrected to play the computer generated persona of this man, a Dr. "Totenkopf", (done VERY "Wizard of Oz",) who has gone about sending his mechanical minions to sap energy from large cities whilst destroying same to build an ark that will preserve life and humanity offworld as the Earth descends into mayhem that he is at least partially responsible for.<br /><br />To say that the visuals are mind-boggling would be an understatement....the visuals are easily the equal of any of the earlier "Star Wars" films and the last fifteen minutes of the film are worth the price of admission. Jude Law is a capable hero as Sky Captain Joe Sullivan, but it's Gwyneth Paltrow as Polly Perkins, a blonde xeroxing of good old Lois Lane, that steals the movie from him! She makes all the mistakes a normal person would make in the movie...inadvertently giving away their presence when they try to stealthily sabotage Totenkopf's lair; not having enough film to capture some of the most incredible, newsworthy tableau a journalist has ever laid eyes on, and doing some of the worst backseat driving since Lucille Ball! The banter between her and Sullivan is straight out of a Bogart and Bacall movie.<br /><br />Some of the actors in the film that portray the scientists that Totenkopf is either killing off or forcing to work for him from the grave, (he managed to infuse his persona in his vast array of computer and broadcasting circuits at his lair,) are truly convincing as meek, put-upon scientists running for their lives from a supposedly dead madman. However, they seem to be very self-involved about it, not really caring that the world at large is in danger as well.<br /><br />Complex and entertaining, "Sky Captain" was perhaps the most underrated film of 2004, and the only one I saw fit to see in the theater. You better believe I had to have it on DVD....!<br /><br />The ending is very cute, btw.<br /><br />By all means, GET IT!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Eastern Sleeper"></head><body><p>Who says you need guns in a movie to make it exciting and successful? Certainly not Eastern Promises Director David Cronenberg. Not a pistol or shot fired in this movie.<br /><br />Cronenberg is on a roll. In 2005 Cronenberg did the awesome <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CQLZ0Q">A History of Violence</a> (with Vigo Mortensen, and Mortensen is the leading man in Eastern Promises too), and A History of Violence was Cronenberg's best since Dead Ringers back in 1988. Strangely, Both A History of Violence and Eastern Promises were not big box office hits. But don't let that fool you. If you missed A History of Violence, don't miss Eastern Promises...then go rent the former.<br /><br />Eastern Promises is an episode in the life of a London chapter of the Russian mob and how an unsuspecting midwife at a local hospital gets mixed up with them. Now that may not sound too compelling, but let me tell you...you get a thoroughly entertaining film here complete with a hard R for brutal, bloody violence.<br /><br />The team of Cronenberg and Mortensen have done it again with Eastern Promises...another fast paced, engrossing film. The movie includes twists that you never see coming, and leaves an opening for Cronenberg to do something he's never done: direct a sequel to one of his films.<br /><br />Check it out.</p></body></html>

Dushku's allure to those males familiar with this actress needs little elaboration. Rob Schmidt directed &quot;Crime + Punishment in Suburbia&quot; a few years ago, a movie I saw a several months ago and enjoyed immensely. And Stan Winston, well, he is the guy behind the special effects in a slew of big budget films which, if not exactly intellectual masterpieces, nonetheless are enormously entertaining movies worth watching. Winston helmed the effects work in the recent &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot; as well as that movie's predecessor. He also does an occasional turn as a producer, as he did with &quot;Wrong Turn&quot; when he wasn't putting together the gooey effects. Even if these three people provide little incentive to potential viewers, the idea of a gang of inbred, cannibalistic hillbillies running amok in backwoods West Virginia ought to bring out the hardcore horror hounds in force. &quot;Wrong Turn&quot; has its share of problems, of that there is no doubt, but the picture moves beyond its shortcomings and creates a memorable movie experience. In a day when low budget, straight to video (DVD?) horror productions appear on store shelves like pustules on a plague victim, it is nice to see something stand a little taller. &quot;Wrong Turn&quot; is one of those movies.<p>We learn within a matter of minutes something sinister is going on in the backwoods of West Virginia. A man and woman have a nasty, fatal encounter with some local residents during a rock-climbing excursion. As it turns out, these two unfortunate souls are only the latest victims in a spate of mysterious disappearances stretching back through the years, unsolved disappearances involving hikers, young children, and any other assortment of individuals unlucky enough to pass through this rugged region. When Chris Finn (Desmond Harrington) zips through the area on his way to an important job interview, he has no idea he will eventually discover the reason for these disturbing disappearances. After learning an accident on the highway will hold him up for hours, he backtracks and drives down a dirt road that promises to get him to his destination on time. Yeah, right. Finn takes his eyes off the road for a second and promptly plows into a broken down vehicle on the road belonging to a quintet of young people. The wreck does not injure anyone, not seriously, but it means both automobiles are down for the count. Finn meets his fellow travelers in distress: mouthy Jesse Burlingame (Dushku), high strung Carly (Emmanuelle Chriqui), laid back Scott (Jeremy Sisto), and two stoners who die almost immediately.<p>After awkward introductions, Finn, Carly, Jesse, and Scott beat their feet down the road in an effort to reach a telephone. The two stoners stay behind and promptly retire from the scene in especially graphic ways. The four survivors, though they don't realize they are in trouble yet, discover what appears to be an abandoned farmhouse tucked away in a little valley. They go inside and realize whomever lives in this place probably rents a room at the local asylum. The place is a nightmare, with all types of gooey, mysterious substances in jars scattered about and some more vaguely unpleasant containers in the refrigerator. Even worse, the homeowners show up while the kiddies are poking around in the house. With no time to flee, our gang hides under beds and in closets as the residents bring some fresh meat in the front door. And whaddya know? Dinner consists of one of the freshly slaughtered stoners killed after our heroes headed down the road. Thus begins the lengthy stalk and slash sequences we horror fans know and love so much. Some will not survive the endurance test that lies ahead, will not last through a chase scene that involves fleeing through forests, climbing into a fire tower, or diving from that tower into some tall trees to continue the chase some seventy or so feet above the ground. All we know is that good will face down evil in the end and win. Or will it?<p>I enjoyed &quot;Wrong Turn&quot; because I like Eliza Dushku. That wasn't always the case, however. I remember first seeing this actress in the obnoxious and cloying film &quot;Bye Bye, Love&quot; back in the early '90s and despised her whiny character in that movie. Since then young Dushku grew up, put on a skintight white tank top, and developed a rich, husky voice that melts the heart. She has a lot to do with the allure of this film, but the excellent gore effects from Winston certainly didn't hurt, either. We get a fancy, on the half shell decapitation (watch and see what I mean), a grotesque garroting, and a few other sickening scenes. Moreover, you have the mutated hicks to contend with, gruesome looking brutes with a taste for human flesh and a love for the hunt. Lots of good stuff here, but a few problems reared their ugly heads from time to time. The overall idea of the film isn't original and I didn't buy the idea of deformed hillbillies possessing superhuman strength. Still, &quot;Wrong Turn&quot; is entertaining enough.<p>The DVD overflows with extras. You get fullscreen and widescreen options, featurettes about Dushku, Winston's special effects, and a behind the scenes documentary. There is also a commentary from Dushku, Harrington, and Schmidt, some trailers, and deleted scenes. Good stuff, especially the look at Winston's lengthy career in the biz. This guy's been involved in so many big movies it simply boggles the mind. If you are a horror fan, you will want to check out &quot;Wrong Turn&quot; soon. I wouldn't be surprised at all to see a sequel arriving at a theater in the next year or so.</p></body></html>

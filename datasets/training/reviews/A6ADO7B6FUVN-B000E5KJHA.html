<meta name="summary" content="A Sweet Tale with Breathtaking Imagery..."></head><body><p>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is the second time Tim Burton approaches Roald Dahl's creations, but it is his first time as a director.  Despite being the first time, as a director, there is something strikingly similar between Burton and Dahl if one looks away from the fact that one is a filmmaker and the other an author, and it is their unique way of telling a tale.  Dahl's many stories are mysterious, clever, and have valuable lessons, as do Burton's films.  Both storytellers convey moral lessons for any individual regardless of age, gender, and ethnicity.  This time Burton directs Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with the full approval of Felicity, Dahl's widow, and he captures the same puzzling world that Dahl once created through a grand adventure containing sweets and moral lessons.<br /><br />Freddie Highmore plays the main character, Charlie Bucket, a boy from a poverty stricken family where the parents nurture all four bedridden grandparents.  Charlie is polite, honorable, and noble, qualities that he most likely has acquired from his loving parents and guiding grandparents.  Nothing seems to touch the family, as they always see the glass as half full.  The Bucket family recognizes that money, possessions, and power do not grant them happiness.  The only thing that makes them truly happy is the love that they have for each other. It is announced to the world that Willy Wonka, the refined and enigmatic chocolatier, will invite five children that find five golden tickets to his factory.  These golden tickets can be found in his chocolate bars and they will provide entrance to his secretive chocolate factory to which no human has entered for years.  When Charlie hears about this he cannot help but dream of entering the factory up the street, and his birthday is just around the corner, which means that he will get a Wonka chocolate bar.<br /><br />In the meantime, Charlie and the folks in the small and raggedy Bucket residence will learn about who and how others have gained access to Wonka's chocolate factory.  Each of the lucky ticket winners brings up different notions of disrespectfulness, which further seems to stem from the seven deadly sins: pride, envy, gluttony, lust, anger, greed, and sloth.  These children are obvious in their character, as they might overtly express two or three of the deadly sins.  However, a younger audience will most likely not recognize the seven deadly sins, but it is nonetheless clear that these ticket winners are rude and have very bad manners.  The film even goes as far as openly suggesting the source, poor parenting.<br /><br />After an extensive introduction of the other characters, which is essential, as the film deals with what is right and wrong in the light of the consequences of being good, or bad, comes the biggest surprise, or maybe not as Charlie discovers the fifth and final ticket.  Together with Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) Charlie gladly leads into the legendary chocolate factory, as the other four children walk ahead of their parents into an adventure that will separate the good from the bad.  It is here, a good chunk into the film, where Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) appears for the first time.<br /><br />Willy Wonka displays an overtly bizarre appearance with a large white smile and eccentric mannerisms that continue throughout the film.  Depp does an extraordinary job in bringing out an aloof and awkward character that frequently seems to drift off to some unknown time and place while standing among his newly arrived guests.  Those viewers who have seen Depp in other films will not identify this character from any of his previous performances.  It is also clear that Burton and Depp have a special relationship, as this is their fourth film and soon the public can see their fifth upcoming puppet film, Corpse Bride (2005).  Depp simply elevates the story far beyond mediocrity into the bizarre fantasy world where Burton seems to be most comfortable where the audience can relinquish it's thoughts completely to the filmmakers performances and storytelling.<br /><br />In 1971 Mel Stuart made Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory based on the same book, which for many has gained a status close to immortality in the world of cinema history.  Despite the notion of remaking an already good film, Burton forcefully delivers his version of the story with the help of a tremendous cast and spectacular cinematography that delivers a fantastic tale.  The film succeeds in reaching the level of the previous film from 1971 and with ease passes the former film based on Dahl's story of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  This film should certainly gain a nod in the Oscars for the best writing and screenplay based on material previously produced or published.  Burton's film grasps the issues in an easily understandable manner which can be understood by both young and old, which does not leave anyone behind.  Yet, Burton leaves a little extra for the adult audience to ponder while also considering the youth by offering them several thoughtful lessons.  In the end, Burton's film delivers a tale that Dahl would have approved of, as it has all the genuine tangibles of both storytellers.</p></body></html>

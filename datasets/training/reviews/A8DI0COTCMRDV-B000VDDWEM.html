<meta name="summary" content="Very Effective Sequel !"></head><body><p>"28 WEEKS LATER" is not only an excellent follow up to the original but speaking for myself, in many ways (especially the end) it's even better than part one. It has a couple of plot holes but nowhere near enough to harm the final outcome. Although I love everything else about part one I never was a big fan of the dull ending...but I really think the way "28 weeks" begins helps to make the dull ending of the original much easier to swallow. All & all I really enjoyed this one and can't wait for another sequel or prequel...wich ever they decide to do. There is potential for either or.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Sideways"></head><body><p>A funny, troubling, and warmly engaging road movie about the twin horrors of aging and regret, Payne's romantic comedy would be an altogether different movie without the shlubby presence of Giamatti, brilliant as the cranky, self-hating wine snob who bonds with Madsen over their love of Pinot Noir. Miles, of course, is too dismayed by hopelessness to receive Maya's good vibrations, while the painfully immature Jack (hilariously played by "Wings" veteran Church) has his hands full with feisty beauty Stephanie, clueless that he's soon due to walk down the aisle. Oscar winner Payne has a sure hand in "Sideways," and a unique way of blending comedy and poignant storytelling.</p></body></html>

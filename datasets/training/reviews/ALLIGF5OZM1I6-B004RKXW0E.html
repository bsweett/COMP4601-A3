It changed the face of animation forever and graced us with some of the warmest characters we've ever known. Toy Story 3 brings all those fond memories and adventures back home for us, once more.<br /><br />Woody (Tom Hanks) and Buzz (Time Allen) are still the personal toys of their beloved child, Andy. But Andy is all grown up, and off to college. Whatever is to happen to Woody and the gang? Only a select group of the toys we met in the original film remain in Andy's long forgotten toy box, which is brilliantly realistic, and they are all begging to be played with.<br /><br />When a final excruciatingly, disappointing attempt to gain Andy's attention and affection fails them; the toys begin to accept that they are no longer needed, and this crushes their spirits. It soon becomes blindingly obvious that their near future will be coursed down one of only three lonely and unfamiliar roads: leading them either to the attic, the garbage, or as donations to a daycare.<br /><br />Much to everyone's surprise, including Woody's - Woody finds himself the only toy in which Andy has chosen to take to college. The rest of them wind up by mistake, in a box designated the `daycare' box, by Andy's mom. Woody adds himself to this donation parcel, in hopes of springing everyone free from the no doubt horrible daycare, first chance he gets.<br /><br />Everyone but Woody seems pretty fond of the idea of daycare. And why shouldn't they? None of them were selected to go to college with Andy. The idea of new children in tempered with their youth wanting to play with all of them, is as good as paradise. So Woody leaves them behind to go with Andy.<br /><br />Ned Beatty joins the franchise as the voice of Lotso; a bright pink Teddy Bear at the day care, who's child abandoned him. Lotso is head of a gang of toys new to us, to include a Ken doll voiced by none other, than Michael Keaton!<br /><br />Somehow, Disney and Pixar have taken their divine talents in animation to yet another level here, and Toy Story 3 is neck and neck with Despicable Me for my pick for best animated feature of the year. I was expecting to have fun this time around, but feared the formula would become tiresome and the jokes would be recycled from the first two installments. This is not the case. From the hilarious action-packed opening, to the tear jerking finale, Toy Story 3 was one of the best cinematic adventures of the year!<br /><br />At one point Buzz has his voice-pack changed to a Spanish setting and at another Mrs. Potato-Head is able to see with her missing eye left while it's left back in Andy's room. Oh, and Mr. Potato Head has to improvise by using leftover lunch items to substitute for his plastic body when it's otherwise indisposed! These are just a few of the many hilarious moments the movie offers.<br /><br />Toy Story 3 is a treat for kids, no doubt. But it will offer them some insight on their feelings about life, and their relationships with the people in their lives, in addition to just entertaining them. It's a cartoon, sure - but it's written very well and it's gushing with moral substance; enough for kids and adults to both indulge in. You won't find that in too many children's films. And let's not forget the amazingly talented cast this franchise has in tow.<br /><br />What I appreciated most about Toy Story 3, that the first two lacked, was the amount of emotion we spill for these characters. We were getting to know them the first two times around, but as I mentioned early on; now - much like Andy, we've grown up with them.  Seeing them left behind by Andy, and the brilliant ending - ripped me apart. We really care about these characters by the end of the film, and we've enjoyed the hours we've shared with them over the years. But in due time, I suppose we all have to put away childish things. It's a shame, though.</p></body></html>

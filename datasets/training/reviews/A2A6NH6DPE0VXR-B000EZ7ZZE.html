The first one ends with her and another survivor being taking in and genitcally altered. Which makes Jovovich a hell of a lot quicker and stronger. The plot in the sequel has her and other survivors stuck in Racoon city with zombies all over the place. A scientist says he can get them out of the city if they find his lost daugher there.<br /><br />  There's tons of action in the movie and Jovovich is in great action form. The movie isn't anywhere near as being a good of a zombie movie as 28 Days Later, Dawn of the Dead or even....Shaun of the Dead. It's still fun though and even better than the first. I think critics such as Ebert & Roeper were way too hard on the movie. It ends making it obvious that a part 3 will be coming soon. Although I liked it, Dawn of the Dead ended making me wanna see more. Resident Evil Apocalypse's ending didn't really make me care whether there's another one or not. Then again part one's ending didn't make me wanna see more either...</p></body></html>

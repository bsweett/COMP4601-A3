This is Eastwood's flip-side companion piece to the earlier "Flags of Our Fathers," which told the story of the Battle of Iwo Jima from the American point of view. For this film, Eastwood has shrunk his canvas considerably, populating it with fewer familiar faces and restricting the action almost entirely to the island itself. Indeed, it is this very air of claustrophobia that makes "Letters from Iwo Jima" a more cohesive, personal and meaningful work than the earlier fine film.<br /><br />As the movie begins, the Japanese army is preparing for an American assault on the island. The film focuses on two main characters, one from the upper echelons of the military and one from the grunt class. The former is Tadamichi Kuribayashi, a Lieutenant General who is sent to the site to take command of the forces for the battle to come. Kuribayashi is a compassionate pragmatist who has to deal not only with the enemy battering away at the island with the relentless fury of heavy artillery but the suicidal tendencies of his own men, many of whom subscribe to the belief that it is more honorable to commit hara-kiri than to endure the ignominy of defeat or surrender. The common soldier's eye view is provided by Saigo, a private reluctantly drafted into the army, who would much rather be back at home with his wife and baby daughter than digging trenches on some godforsaken rock in the middle of nowhere, and who feels less eager than his compatriots to sacrifice his life in service of his country.<br /><br />By limiting their scope, Eastwood and screenwriter Iris Yamashita - working from the actual letters Kuribayashi and others sent home from the island - show us the horrors of war on a more personal scale than we generally find in films of this type. We come to identify with the desperation felt by 20,000 soldiers trying to fend off a force of 100,000 without benefit of naval or air support, virtually assured that none of them would ever make it off the island alive. The superb actor Ken Watanabe invests Kuribayashi with a confidence and compassion that makes us understand why the men under his command respect and follow him, and Kazunari Ninomiya perfectly embodies the contradictory nature of the everyman soldier. Torn between duty to self and duty to country, Saigo does what is asked of him yet evinces a much stronger commitment to self-preservation than do many of his buddies who seem all too eager to fall on the sword (or, the modern equivalent, a grenade) to avoid humiliation at the hands of the enemy. Ninomiya, with his openhearted demeanor and impish expression of boyish innocence, provides the emotional center the film needs to connect with the audience.<br /><br />As with "Flags of Our Fathers," cinematographer Tom Stern has bled so much of the color out of the picture that we seem almost to be watching a black-and-white movie, a technique that greatly enhances the bleakness of both the setting and the situation.<br /><br />"Letters from Iwo Jima" is not a film designed to appeal to the yahoos in the audience; it is, rather, a stripped-down, thoughtful and artful consideration of the horrors of war as seen through the eyes of "the enemy."</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Completely original and flat out amazing"></head><body><p>This might be one of the most intensely bizarre movies I have ever seen. Completely original and flat out amazing.<br /><br />The screenplay is difficult to review without giving away the entire plot. I haven't read all the submissions, so I can only presume some spoiling jackass has already done so. And what a tragedy for anyone who hasn't yet seen this powerful film.<br /><br />If you're lucky enough to be free from any spoilers as I was: Old Boy is completely original (how many times can you honestly say that about a film?), independently creative, performed meticulously and is deliciously twisted.<br /><br />Top marks in every category that I can think of - and well worth the full purchase price. Don't even blink if a clean used copy is available - buy it.<br /><br />One important note: Absolutely do not get the dubbed version. So much emotion, so much power is felt thru the original Korean dialogue.<br /><br />A full five stars with no qualifiers. One of the best dramas I have ever seen.</p></body></html>

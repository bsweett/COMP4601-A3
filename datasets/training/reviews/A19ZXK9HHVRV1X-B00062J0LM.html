For this new version, the Cold War has been replaced by the War on Terror as the menacing background against which the story unfolds, but, apart from that, the major plot points in both films are virtually the same.  Both involve a group of soldiers who are brainwashed into believing that one of them, Sergeant Raymond Shaw, is a hero whose unquestioning bravery and quick thinking on the battlefield saved the lives of most of the men in that squadron.  (The original's Korean War setting has been updated to the Gulf War's Desert Storm).  In fact, upon his return, Shaw is awarded the Medal of Honor, a tribute he eventually parlays into a career as a United States congressman.  After several of the men in the squadron begin having the same recurring nightmare in which they are being subjected to murderous hypnotic suggestions, one of them, Captain/Major Bennett Marco, comes to suspect that they may all be the victims of some nefarious scheme to implant them with microchips to get them to believe something that is not true.  One of the few key differences between the new version and the old version is that the "Manchurian" of the title no longer refers to the Communists who do the brainwashing but rather to a mega-corporation (called Manchurian Global) that has positioned itself as the master puppeteer pulling the strings of government behind the scenes.  And in its scathing vision of modern day politics, the film asks just how much of our freedom and civil liberties we are willing to sacrifice in exchange for "security" and "safety."  No theme could be more timely.<br /><br />It would be a disservice to "The Manchurian Candidate" to reveal too much about its ingeniously contrived plot, which is chock full of intrigue, suspense and larger-than-life events and people.  The dominating figure in the nightmare scenario is Eleanor Shaw, an uber-powerful senator and the ultimate Machiavellian matriarch, whose unrelenting and nefarious effort to get her craven, mediocre Congressman son elected Vice President, serves as the engine that pulls the story forward.  Thus, while Marco spends his time trying to piece together some semblance of the truth out of the fabricated memories and distorted half-truths spinning around in his jumbled memory and mind, Eleanor works her way to the ultimate position of power.<br /><br />This new "Candidate" gleans its topicality and its contemporary significance by zeroing in on the nexus that exists between politics and the corrupt military-industrial complex - a connection made even more frightening when the latter, working in a moral vacuum, is able to employ the latest in technological advancements to further its cause.<br /><br />Although the surrealistic elements are probably less shocking today than they were in 1962, the film still does an amazing job replicating the dislocation and fragmentation of Marco's mind, establishing a beautiful balance between the world of "real" reality and the world of virtual reality, a concept that seems far less incredible in this day and age of ubiquitous computer technology.<br /><br />Denzel Washington takes over the role of Marco, originally played by Frank Sinatra, and Live Schreiber replaces Laurence Harvey as the mother-dominated Shaw.  Both actors are superb.  But it is Meryl Streep, stepping in for Angela Lansbury as the Big Bad Mama Supreme, who walks off with the film.  Her portrayal of a ruthless and icy Lady MacBeth who will stop at nothing to get what she wants is bone-chilling and unforgettable.<br /><br />In an age in which most thrillers are formulaic, empty exercises in high-tech wizardry and flash, perhaps it was necessary to reach back 42 years to find a work of power and substance to remind us of just how dangerous it is to allow modern technology to fall into the hands of the power-hungry and the ruthless.  Indeed, what this gripping tale of an attempted coup against the United States government manages to do is to remind us that, even in this age of international terrorism, the greatest threat to our unity as a nation and our safety as a people may actually come from within.</p></body></html>

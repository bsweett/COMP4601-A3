<meta name="summary" content="Twisted film from masterminds Tarentino and Rodriguez..."></head><body><p>The first half of this hardcore action flick has George Clooney and Quentin Tarentino hijacking a mobile home to get across the border into Mexico. The second half is our heroes fighting off vampires in a strip club. The two don't come together very well, but both halves are executed perfectly with a cutting edge and some very cool dialogue. This film is all about blood, violence, and gore mixed with some T&A, making this a young man's dream movie. Constantly exciting and always taut, "From Dusk till Dawn" is the perfect movie for parties or just hangin out with the guys. The special effects are cool, the direction is slick and the acting is [excellent].</p></body></html>

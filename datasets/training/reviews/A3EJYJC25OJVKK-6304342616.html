<meta name="summary" content="Awesome movie!"></head><body><p>I still remember very vividly when my mom yelled &quot;Oh My God!&quot; when we watched the preview trailers for this movie around the time it was released. <p>Upon seeing it, I have to say that &quot;Independence Day&quot; is one of the greatest sci-fi action movies that I have ever seen. Seven years later (At the time of this review), this movie still packs a big punch. The story is of when a large and vicious alien race invade the earth through city-sized spacecraft and wage war against Earth's humanity and now the humans all stop fighting each other and join forces to destroy the alien ships and the aliens themselves before they destroy every major city on earth, suck out all of it's resources and move on to the next planet. <p>This is a truly magnificent movie. One of the best of 1996.</p></body></html>

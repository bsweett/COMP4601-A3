<meta name="summary" content="Not quite the book..."></head><body><p>This was a good book that was kind of slow in the beginning but picked up pace after the "event" happened.  It was another book that I stayed up to finish because I couldn't put it down.  The movie had the same feel to it in that regard because it was kind of slow in the beginning but picked up after the "event".<br />That being said, it would have been much nicer had they would have followed the book much closer.  First glaring mistake, in the book the terrorists were Arabs and it made more sense than some secret Right Wing European organization.  I realize that Arab terrorist is a stereotype, but it works.  Nazis make good enemies, but given the circumstances around the event, Arabs made more sense.  Second glaring mistake, Jack Ryan in the book was a much higher level in the CIA but there were some issues surrounding him that made some folks not listen to him.  It finally took a contact on the inside that he knew fairly well to get both sides to stand down.<br />That being said, I thought it was good movie but it would have been much better if it had followed the book.  I thought the scenes at the end showing the escalation were great.  Not quite to Failsafe or Dr. Strangelove levels of tension, but not too bad.  The portrayal of the nuclear blast was the best though.  It was very jarring and that's when the movie picked up.  I especially liked the filmmakers take on what would happen in such an event.  I just hope we never see a real one.</p></body></html>

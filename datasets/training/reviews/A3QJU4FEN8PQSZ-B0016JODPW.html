<meta name="summary" content="Terrible, slow, tedious, bleak"></head><body><p>Warning! THIS IS NOT A "THRILLER"! It's an incredibly slow, depressing, tedious "acting showcase" with no point.<br /><br />I write this in the hope that some will be saved. Take heed!<br /><br />It's sad that, like the sermonette "Lions for Lambs", they felt they had to market it as a "thriller".<br /><br />There are NO "twists" or "turns", unless you can't see three feet in front of you. Did I mention it's SLOOOOOOOW? Absolutely horrible. And "bleak" doesn't even begin to describe how thoroughly depressing this movie is.<br /><br />As for all the comments about the acting, I really don't see what the big deal is. There's nothing done here that couldn't be done by, say, Tom Cruise.<br /><br />Don't say you weren't warned.<br /><br />UPDATE: A friend of mine took no heed and ... watched it. He lamented his folly afterward, to no consolation. I'm not kidding here, folks! It's absolutely slow, bleak, plodding, and otherwise horrible.</p></body></html>

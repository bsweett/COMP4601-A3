Strong performances highlight this story, with Crowe a standout in his role as captain.  This collector's edition is a bit pricey, but it does contain some of the best extras I have ever seen in a dvd.  From the featurettes to the 28 page booklet, this is for the serious collector who really loves this movie.  Also included are 20 minutes of deleted scenes that really don't add much to the story.  Overall this is a fantastic story, and a rousing adventure epic.</p></body></html>

It's too childish and slow for most adults and it's too sad for kids, especially younger ones. The storyline and ending are a huge downer. There isn't really anything cute, funny or witty about this movie. It is also billed as a "fantasy" which as other reviwers mentioned is false advertising. This is a DRAMA, not a fantasy movie. Any fantasy scenes are short, probably not even 10 minutes out of the whole movie.<br /><br />The story seems like a ripoff of the movie "My Girl" only the genders of the kids are reversed and there are a few unimpressive fantasy scenes thrown in which do nothing for the plot other than drag it out. The one big difference here= The movie "My Girl" had a plot, had better acting, better character development and it had some humor and realism to balance out the sad ending. I don't mind a sad ending if the story was worth it. The Bridge to Terriblebithia isn't worth it. It is a tragedy of a movie with an equally tragic ending!</p></body></html>

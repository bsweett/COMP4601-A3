<meta name="summary" content="Okay..."></head><body><p>Being an Elektra fan, I was eager to seer this film. However, I must say that I am disappointed. This movie is not as faithful to its source material as it should be. Now of course, I know that movies are never exactly the same, and found myself satisfied with such films as Dune and The Color Purple, but this movie just didn't cut it.<br /><br />Nothing personal against Jennifer Garner, but I did not feel her appropriate for this role. She is not a bad actress per se, but this role was very unsuited for her, and the story itself isn't as much about Elektra as one would think. Overall, I can only give it 3/5 stars at best.</p></body></html>

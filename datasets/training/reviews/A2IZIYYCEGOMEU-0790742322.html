Alec Baldwin, and Geena Davis do a credible job in their roles as newly departed homeowners caught up in underworld bureaucracy, and Wynona Ryder is delightful as the morbidly-inclined daughter of the 'bio' invaders of the home Baldwin, and Davis don't want to move on from. There are very few dark farces as comically twisted as this delightful romp through the afterlife, and none with a more hilarious lead anywhere. I haven't grown tired of watching this macabre laugh-riot in twenty years, and unless you're missing a funny bone, you won't either.</p></body></html>

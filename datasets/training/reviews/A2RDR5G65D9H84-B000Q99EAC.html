After a very disappointing Rocky V, I decided that I was just going to watch this final film for the sake of completeness, but I expected it to be a bad, or at best a neutral, experience. To my surprise, the end of the saga is really good, with a nicely built story, and a movie which provides the whole journey with an elegant symmetry.<br /><br />Adrian has died, victim to cancer, and Rocky owns a restaurant that is successful only by virtue of the fame of its owner. Patrons visit the establishment looking for a first-hand story, or a picture, or an autograph. Meanwhile, Rocky's son is trying to make it in the corporate world, but is having a tough time dealing with being a celebrity's son. This in turn puts a strain in the relationship with his father that takes a big toll on Rocky. When a computer simulated fight between the current heavyweight champion and the old hero takes place on Sportscenter, with a controversial result, the door opens for the return of the people's champion.<br /><br />I am extremely glad I was wrong about this film, since this provides a classy ending to one of the best collection of sports movies of all time. Stallone delivers a much better performance than I expected after watching him being a guest in Monday Night Football. He has some restrictions in terms of facial expressions, but this does works well with the character, and he provides the needed level of passion and energy. Milo Ventimiglia, who plays Robert Jr., also adds to the quality of this movie, since he is right on target with his performance, portraying the inner conflicts of his character masterfully. The final fight might not be the best we have seen in this series of movies, but it is definitely adequate.<br /><br />Anyone that has been following the Rocky movies needs to watch this final installment. And please, if you were discouraged by the dreadful Rocky V, do not be afraid, this new movie will definitely make it up to you.</p></body></html>

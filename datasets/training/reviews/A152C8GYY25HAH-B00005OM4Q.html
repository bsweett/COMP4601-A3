<meta name="summary" content="Best Movie About Rock and Roll I've Ever Seen"></head><body><p>Sometimes a film comes along, and it enchants and excites you. It makes you believe in movie magic again. This may happen infrequently, but when it does, it reminds you of what made you fall in love with the movies to begin with. Of course, even the best movie triggers these feelings in only part of its audience. For me, Almost Famous is one of those pictures. Since the print media and the visual media are so different, I doubt this review can tell you if the film has the same in store for you. <p>Writer and director Cameron Crowe has had a charmed life, and he knows it, as can be seen in this partly autobiographical and partly fictionalized tale. When he was just fifteen years old, he got the first of several writing assignment from Rolling Stone magazine. Almost Famous is the story of a kid on the road with a rock and roll band in the early 1970s.<p>Young William Miller [Patrick Fugit] has come to the attention of Rolling Stone because of some articles he wrote for Creem magazine. The assignment comes via telephone, and the editors are unaware that they are hiring a teenager. William doesn't have much luck hooking up the band Stillwater until he gets a little help from a groupie called Penny Lane [Kate Hudson]. Penny is in love with Stillwater's lead guitarist, Russell [Billy Crudup]. Since he has a girlfriend back in New York, she tries to pretend she's just a friend, but everyone sees right through her. William's mother, Elaine [Frances McDormand], who has already alienated her daughter, Anita [Zooey Deschanel], is reluctant to let William go. She gives in when he promises to be back in time for high school graduation and swears he won't do drugs. He keeps his word on the drugs, but the tour and the group mesmerize the kid. He winds up on the road with them for weeks. It is, to say the least, an interesting trip. <p>This is perhaps the best coming of age movie I have ever seen. It ranks arguably at the top of movies about rock and roll, and it certainly feels like the most authentic. The songs performed by Stillwater were written for the movie by Crowe and others, and they fit in seamlessly with the vintage rock and roll tunes played throughout the film. The look and the feel of the 70s is captured perfectly. It was a very different time for music. It was a period when talent and idealism ruled the scene. It would not be long until all pop music was all confiscated by vast corporations. You see the beginnings of this process in the movie when a creep from the record company comes in to replace the band's long time manager and friend. <p>The acting is all world-class. Francis McDormand and Kate Hudson were deservedly nominated for Academy awards, but the whole cast is uniformly excellent. <p>This movie has a lot of drama in it, but it also has a lot of laughs. It remains upbeat more often than not. It has heart, something that is lacking in many films, but it is never sappy or sentimental. it touches you without making you feel manipulated. It is, I suspect, the best movie of last year. <p>Rated R for language, drug content and brief nudity. [I disagree with the MPAA on this one. I think Almost Famous is perfect for teens. Did they expect it to be historically inaccurate just because what was cool then isn't cool now?}</p></body></html>

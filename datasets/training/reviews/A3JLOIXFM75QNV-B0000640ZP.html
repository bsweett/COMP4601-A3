<meta name="summary" content="A surprisingly effective ghost story"></head><body><p>There is a difference between being scared and being creeped out. The Others is in no way a horror film. But it will give you constant chills. Its superbly acted and effective atmosphere make it one of the best ghost type films out there. This is more than a 'huge creepy house' type mystery. And there is mystery. There is suspence. But there is a great sadness to this film too and Nicole Kidman perfectly accomplishes this by acting as she has never acted before. Its no wonder she got nominated for this role. Its so subtle but you really have to be able to pull it off. The scenery is just so perfectly morose you really get into it. This movie does not dissapoint.</p></body></html>

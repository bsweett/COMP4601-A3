Just like Lost in Translation, Murray plays to the hilt the role of a rich, jaded, washed-up, older ladies' man. The only problem is that he's boring to watch. This could have been a decent movie if the character of Don Johnston actually had a spark of mischievous life left in him, and I know just the actor who could have pulled it off brilliantly: Jack Nicholson. Sure, Jack's fat, ugly, and middle-aged, but he still effuses like crazy his "bad boy" pheromones. Murray's deadpan demeanor might play better in the role of a corpse in a wake.<br /><br />As for the story, I did not like the inconclusive ending - it seemed pretentiously avant-garde. A decent conclusion might have redeemed the plodding plot. And why did all of Don's exes have to be messed up in one way or another? Is it asking too much for just one of them to be happy and normal? Wait, I get it! All those beautiful, delicate, messed up women are the broken flowers, and our Don Johnston, aka Don Juan, is the cad who broke them, right? But the movie never shows us how these ladies were broken, and it never shows Don as a cad. Don is boring, depressed, rude, and unwilling to make a commitment - just like that other middle-aged twit in Shopgirl, and just like the real-life Don Johnson, come to think of it - but he seems harmless enough.<br /><br />And just how did Don remember the names of five women he had brief affairs with from twenty years ago? And within one day his neighbor could find the current addresses of all five from a quick search on the internet? Wow, I'd like to learn that trick. And of course all of the ladies happened to be home whenever he came unexpectedly knocking on their doors. Oh, and give me a break with the oh-so-highbrow literate humor when the half-dressed nymphet teenage daughter of one of Don's amours introduces herself as "Lola, but my friends call me Lo, but my real name is Lolita." (And she hasn't got a clue about the book or movie of her infamous namesake) That's just too funny - and it makes me feel so smart that I got it. Even more highbrow humor could be found with numerous people mixing up Don Johnston with Don Johnson. Did Johnson pay to have his name repeated, like the embedded ads for Ford Taurus and MapQuest in this film?<br /><br />More seriously, Don is a poor communicator and he never seems to feel empathy for anyone. That explains why he's alone, but it doesn't explain how he continues to attract an endless stream of beautiful, younger women. Since he leaves Sharon Stone with a very satisfied smile after a sleepover tryst, I guess we're supposed to assume that Don is a great lover. Don may appear to be bored, depressed, and rude, but he's red hot in bed! Some of Don's remarks are insensitive and border on cruel. The best scene in the film is when an oafish biker punches him in the eye for being rude. I wanted to punch him, too.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="HIS BEST CHASER..."></head><body><p>It seems 2 me that Hitchcock sort of stole many elements from his pre-chaser-films and said: &quot;Good-eeeeevening..... You think you have seen my best efforts, but I must unfortunately dissappoint you.....!&quot;<p>Indeed this is a neurotic and clastraphobic chaser and suspenser - maybe the BEST EVER - thanks 2 the talents of Ernest Lehman, Hitchcock himself, his crew and the entire cast. There are numerous highlights from this film; I prefer NOT 2 single out any of them in favour of others.  This film belongs IN EVERY HOME:-)</p></body></html>

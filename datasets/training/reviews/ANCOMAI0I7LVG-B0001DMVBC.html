<meta name="summary" content="Frustration may very well be my Achilles heal..."></head><body><p>To be honest, I like depressing.  Seriously, I relish in it; I mean I practically bathe myself in depressing.  I don't know why, label me weird all you want, but there is something about the cinematic representation of that whole `all is lost' that just really moves me in ways that most other cinema cannot.  That said; Andre Dubus III's novel `House of Sand and Fog' was one of the most dreadfully depressing, ultimately frustrating novels I have ever read.  This is coming from a guy who likes depressing (frustrating, now that is another story).<br /><br />The film fares better than the novel for me (which also suffered from being far too long and overwrought) but to be honest, it never manages to lift itself high enough to become brilliant.  I believe the potential was there, but I just don't think the film got everything right.<br /><br />For those of you unfamiliar, `House of Sand and Fog' tells the story of Kathy Nicolo, a young and slightly immature woman who lives in a house once belonging to her father.  When she disregards notes regarding a tax she is unfairly charged she winds up being evicted from her home, even though the tax should have never been administered to her.  Before the damage can be reversed her house if put up for auction and purchased by Iranian former military officer Behrani.  Behrani is desperately trying to give his family the stature they once possessed and he sees the purchase of this home and an opportunity to do just that.  His stubbornness, as well as that of Kathy, lead to some very compromising situations, all of which could have been avoided had either of them acted like adults.<br /><br />Like I said, this story is very frustrating.<br /><br />That is my biggest complaint really.  I remember reading the book and getting all sorts of anxious because I could not foresee any sort of redemption in these characters.  I wanted to slap them all and force them to objectively look at their situation.  Watching the movie is almost as difficult for me, because they do the same stupid things; it only fares better because you don't dwell on the situation for weeks on end, it only takes two hours this time.<br /><br />The film does have some very high points as well though.  The acting on almost every front is superb.  Ben Kingsley and Shohreh Aghgashloo were both Oscar nominated for their performances, and deservedly so.  Kingsley is a force as the confrontational Behrani, but it is Aghdashloo's blessedly restrained portrayal of his wife Nadi that steals the entire film (she should have won the Oscar, hands down).  Jennifer Connelly is also very effective, but she takes a back seat to the commanding strengths of her co-stars.  Ron Eldard is the films weak link, and while he is not entirely to blame (his character repulses me) he doesn't do much to make up for the lack of emotional connection his character possesses.<br /><br />The direction by Vadim Perelman is well done.  It captures the ominous tone of the film.  Like I said, this does fare better than the novel, for it is not as deeply unsettling (although the ending is definitely heartbreaking) so one can actually `take' this one, but know that this is not for the faint of heart.  If emotional distress is something that leaves you with any sort of lasting discomfort then stay away from this film, and please avoid the novel at all cost.<br /><br />Yes, I love a good depressing film, but when depressing mixes heavily with unwarranted frustration I get overworked and overwhelmed.  That said; I cannot deny the fact that this is still a very well constructed film that hits its mark on just about every level.  The character of Lester really ruins a lot for me (I hate individuals that are `that' destructively stupid) but as a whole the film is very good, if not nightmarishly effective.</p></body></html>

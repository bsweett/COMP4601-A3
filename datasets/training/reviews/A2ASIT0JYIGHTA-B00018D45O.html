TCM 2003 has done that!  It is so much better than the original, but to be fair, it isn't really a remake.  It is quite different from the original, but that is a very good thing!  Where the original was extremely slow moving and about 40% scary, the 2003 film creates a totally different atmosphere. It is very eeery from the word go.  To top it off, the redneck hillbillies are much more scarier, as are the corrupt police.<p>I was reluctant at first to see this film because I found the orginal so overhyped and boring - but this film is in a class of its own in the horror genre.  Excellent effort by all concerned.<p>Highly recommended to all horror fans.</p></body></html>

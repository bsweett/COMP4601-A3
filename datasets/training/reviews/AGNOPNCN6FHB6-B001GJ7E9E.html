<meta name="summary" content="ahhh the memories....."></head><body><p>any married couple watching this might closely relate to this action packed comedy... i.e. the super steamy start, the unfolding ennui, the forced emotion, constant lies, the hatred, the death wish, and the deux-ex machina, the therapist!!  loved this film... intrigue, suspense, humor, and a cathartic conclusion... thought the dept store shootout was overly protracted but the makeup scene was well worth the wait, this is one muy caliente (sp) team that sizzles in every scene and the crazy violence only enhances the instincts...Brad n Angie have a lovely tribute to their on screen nadir which will provide intense excitement for both sexes...thanks for this gift of entertainment! high recommend</p></body></html>

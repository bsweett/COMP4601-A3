<meta name="summary" content="I Wanted To Like It. 15 out of 100."></head><body><p>I wanted to like this movie. Looking for sci-fi flicks I have yet to watch on NetFlix, I read stunning reviews regarding Dark City. I eagerly dropped it into the queue, and in two days it landed on my doorstep. Unfortunately, after 30 minutes, I punted the movie, and sent it back.<br /><br />Good actors, but horrible material to work with. The villains were hokey, and Kiefer Sutherland was horrible as the mad scientist. He kept breathing like a goofball between every word, as if his breathing technique would make up for a lack of creating a convincing character.<br /><br />Yes, the world was dark, and gritty, and all that. The story was plausible, but the screen play was cheesy. In the end, I was left saying: what a waste! What a waste of acting talent. The world moved on, and so did I. If you have friends who say this is better than the Matrix, should should call your local phone company ASAP and have their number blocked.<br /><br />Check it out. You might like it. Me? I took a bathroom break after 30 minutes and decided to take a nap rather than finishing this stunningly cheese-puff yawner.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 15<br /><br />7 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.<br />2 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?<br />1 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?<br />3 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace. Is the movie forgettable, or something you will talk about and remember for weeks? Years?<br />2 (out of 10). Must see. Is this movie worth seeing/renting?<br />0 (out of 10). Must buy. Is this movie a must buy/purchase?</p></body></html>

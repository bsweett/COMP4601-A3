<meta name="summary" content="The best thriller of 2004"></head><body><p>"Collateral" isn't just one of the best thrillers of the year, it's one of the best American movies of the year. Admittedly, 2004 has been a fairly weak one for exceptional films, but "Collateral' could hold it's own in any recent year. It becomes more than a little implausible towards the end, but, as in a lot of great movies, you don't really think about this until after long after the final credits have rolled.<br /><br />"Collateral" reaffirms my belief that a great action film isn't just about great action, it's also about great characters, which comes from great screenwriting and great acting. "Collateral" takes the time to define the main characters, Vincent [Tom Cruise] and Max [Jamie Foxx], and allows the actors to actually act.<br /><br />Max is a Los Angeles cab driver. He has conned himself into believing that, even though he's been a taxi driver for twelve years, some day soon he'll realize his dream of operating a limo service in some island paradise. One night he picks up a fare, Vincent, who offers him $600 to drive him to five stops over the course of the night. What Max doesn't know is that Vincent is a contract killer. The five stops are to eliminate five witness from a gang-related Federal trial. In a perfect world, Max might have been none the wiser. Vincent would have gotten out of the cab and quietly done his business. As luck would have it, though, the first victim falls out of a third story window and lands right on the unsuspecting Max's waiting cab. The rest of the night turns into chaos.<br /><br />Between each `hit'. Vincent and Max get to know each other a little better, and the audience gets to know the characters better, thus allowing a greater involvement in this deadly cat and mouse game.<br /><br />In a way, "Collateral" is an `homage' to the great Alfred Hitchcock, whose persistent theme was that of an innocent man's being caught up in a web woven by a villain. Director Michael Mann, though, takes the genre and creates something uniquely his own - a masterful thriller in its own right.</p></body></html>

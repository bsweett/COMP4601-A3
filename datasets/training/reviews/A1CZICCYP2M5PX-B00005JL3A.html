<meta name="summary" content="Flawed but Entertaining, at times-Scary, Horror/Action Flick"></head><body><p>When a Dangerous Virus that got Broken in a Giant Corporation and turning the Virus loose and it has Scaped in a Secret Facility, which is called-The Hive. Killing, all the People from not letting the Virus Escaping. Then all the Dead Workers and Dogs from the Umbrella Corporation becomes Zombies and they were Studying-in the Isolated Place of Raccoon City. When a young woman wakes Up without remebering nothing-Alice (Milla Jovovich) is taked by a Group of Soldiers, telling Her, who is really is and aksed to Help the Team to Shut Down, an Super-Intelligent Company and an Dangerous Virus before it's goes out into the Entire World.<p>Written and Directed by Paul W.S. Anderson (Mortal Kombat, Event Horizon, Soldier) made a Strong, Entertaining, Sci-Fi/Horror/Action-Thriller, Based on a Popular Video Game. Originally George A. Romero was the Writer and Director for this Movie but he left from Creative Differences (Although Anderson does some Tribute to Romero in this Flick). This Movie plays like it's Dawn of the Dead meets Aliens, which surprisingly works well but It's does have Some Weakness and also has some unintentional laughs coming from the Dialogue. Anderson brings a stylish Edge to the Film and Even when the Zombies are Scary. Jovovich looks good in this Flick, also Michelle Rodriguez and Eric Mabius gives Good Performances. The ending isn't great but it's a set-up for a Sequel. Resident Evil wasn't a Huge Hit in Theaters, since there's a sequel in the works. We will see, if that second part of the film-would be better than the first film. Director:Paul W.S. Anderson pulls this off well. Don't miss, this Underrated flick. DVD's has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an terrific Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an commentary track by Director-Anderson, Producer-Bolt and Actors-Jovovich and Rodriguez and a few nice extras. Rumor that Anderson is working a 2-Disc Collector's Edition on the film-Including his original NC-17 Cut before he recut it for an R and it seems to have a different ending also. Grade:B+.</p></body></html>

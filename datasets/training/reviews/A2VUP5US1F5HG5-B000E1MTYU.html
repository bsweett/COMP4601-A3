Whether or not it's as good or better than its predecessors, "Rise of the Machines" stands perfectly well on its own merits.  Schwarzenegger is his unimitable self, reprising the heroic role he assumed for T2 with an obvious gusto that shines undimmed through his killer cyborg's facade.  Nick Stahl is convincing as the enigmatic John Connor, and Claire Danes is appealing as his unexpected soul mate (aren't they always?).  And of course there's Kristanna Loken, the ice-cold Terminatrix who gives Schwarzenegger all he can handle, and then some.  The stunts are spectacular, the action literally non-stop, and the tone eerie and somber despite all the truly glorious comic relief.  No, this is not a James Cameron film, but that's not all bad. It *IS* a Schwarzenegger film, and a damn good one. But behind all its action and adrenaline, "Terminator 3" does have a brain, and is arguably more thoughtful than either of the previous chapters. Is Judgment Day inevitable?  Is there no fate but what we make, or is Destiny immutable?  Only time--and the next Terminator--will tell.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Too Clever by Half..."></head><body><p>The 2006 movie "Inside Man" would appear to have a lot going for it: a tense plot built around a hostage situation in a New York City bank, a handful of first rate actors, and an accomplished director with a real feel for his native city.  However, this movie might be too clever for its own good.<br /><br />The movie opens with a bank heist that gets interrupted by the police, turning into a hostage situation.  NYPD Detective Frazer (Denzel Washington) gets tagged to be the on-scene negotiator, and runs into trouble dealing with a senior uniformed cop (Willem Dafoe), the leader of the heist crew (Clive Owen), and a high-level New York City fixer (Jodie Foster in serious high heels) dispatched by the bank's owner (Christopher Plummer).  Frazer patiently works the hostage problem while increasingly becoming aware that he is being played.<br /><br />This movie is strongest in its presentation of "how things get done" in NYC, with overtones of racial prejudice, official corruption, and deal-making everywhere.  Every principal character is potentially flawed in his or her motivations.  Meanwhile, the tension builds relentlessly toward a crisis point in the hostage negotiations.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie undermines its own suspense by telling the story backwards and forwards; the audience knows early on who survives.  The secret at the heart of an admittedly clever heist plot is poorly handled, leading to an ending without much fizz.  The movie's moral punch line is muddied by all the deal-making, including by the supposed good guys.  "Inside Man" isn't a bad movie; it just isn't all it could have been.</p></body></html>

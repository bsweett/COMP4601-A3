<meta name="summary" content="Intense"></head><body><p>"North by Northwest" is an in tense film made in the concept of the wrong man at the wrong time, just like in "The Man that Knew Too Much".  Hitchcock is  amaster ofdirection and he has chosen a brilliant cast to go with an equally briniant plot.  The characters delelop well and Cary Grant offers an amazing perfomance of an innocent man chased all over the US in order to save his life and proove his innocence.  Meanwhile romance is thrown in the plot with a mystirious but gorgeous Eva Marie Saint.<br /><br />A great addition to your collection.</p></body></html>

To see a director make a film just to may some sort of a tribute to his own profession, film - making, is just not that overwhelming. I like dramas based on the human emotion, it seems this is specifically based on creating magic out of nothing. THE ILLUSIONIST and PRESTIGE are films based in similar era's that tower over HUGO. Hugo is a primeval film about machines and man at the dawn of the cinema era. I don't blame myself entirely for not curbing my apathy towards this film. It is not a bad film - it is just ordinary and hardly moving.<br /><br />Watch this if you don't mind watching a two hour long film based in early 20th century about an orphan.<br /><br />I have a sinking feeling that M.S thinks he nailed crime/drama films after THE DEPARTED and won't be making a film with that bent again. He is starting doing these tributes to film making - SHUTTER ISLAND for instance, what was that all about?! Yet, that is a much better, more laconic film than Hugo (Which I doubt will figure in my top 15 of last year)</p></body></html>

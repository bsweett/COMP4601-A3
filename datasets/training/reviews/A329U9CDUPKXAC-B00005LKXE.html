I think this movie perfectly followed up the first story with the exception of the new Clarice. The story in this movie is extremely good. Hannibal's victim using Clarice to seek revenge on him. Clarice saving the man she fears only to be stuck at a dinner table and watching Hannibal feed a man his own brain? That scene was very sickening and hard to watch but I just couldn't tear my eyes away. The only let down is that this movie doesn't let you get to know Hannibal more. I'd like to know the first time he ate somebody. Maybe there will be a third one but I doubt it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Indiana Jones style archeology without the ick factor"></head><body><p>Egyptian priest Imhotep was mummified alive and cursed after killing Pharaoh Seti and sleeping with his intended fiancee. In 1923, treasure hunters Rick O'Connell (Fraser), Evelyn Carnahan (Weisz), and Jonathan Carnahan (Hannah) accidentally set him free.  It's up to the intrepid trio -- with a little help from their friends -- to set things right before the Mummy destroys the world.  You've got a good deal of action and adventure with some serious romance thrown in, too.<br /><br />If you don't mind the slash and burn style archeology from "Indiana Jones" with a lower ick factor and a bit more comedy, you'll enjoy "The Mummy."<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, August 2008</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Very violent and (surprisingly) suspenseful. VERY EFFECTIVE. An improvement over the 1st film."></head><body><p>Horror sequels usually fail do add anything interesting to the film(s) that came before simply because studios insist on the mere delivering of the same. It is like if they could isolate the things that worked and started reproducing it over and over. That's nothing new with that and any FRIDAY THE 13TH fan (like me) knows about that.<br /><br />But Hostel 2 did a better job than most sequels usually do and it's a pity the film did not perform at the box office as expected... because this film actually very good.<br /><br />After a brief intro starting exactly where the first film ended (where we see what happens with the guy who survived after he comes back home) there we go again to Europe where we meet three new will-be-victims (this time girls) as they fall into the same scheme.<br /><br />Until then, nothing new.<br /><br />But then... the narrative splits and we start to follow a secondary set of characters: the clients who paid for them. That is a very interesting change. And that is just the start of a great horror screenplay with a couple of really genuine well written twists. In products like this film, that level of quality is rare.<br /><br />Now... I found it as violent as the first film. Meaning that the make-up and prosthetics are (as usual) made to shock. All other elements are equally fine.<br /><br />This is one of the best sequels out there.<br />And it is worth a look.</p></body></html>

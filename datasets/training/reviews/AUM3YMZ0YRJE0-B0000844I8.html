<meta name="summary" content="mediocre sci-fi melodrama"></head><body><p>I just watched this for the first time since I saw it in 1994, and I must say that with the exception of a few scenes, this is a boring forwula-driven film.  While Jaye Davidson is a very interesting RA - "I created your culture, now I will destroy it" - and Spader and Russell are exceptional actors, they cannot make up for the silly themes of oppressed people uprising, the establishment of a "team spirit" among the hapless military who took the trip, etc.  It just doesn't hang together all that well and there is very little originiality.  If you are a fan of hard scifi, don't bother with this one.  It is just barely a cut above junk.</p></body></html>

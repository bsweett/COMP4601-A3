Yea, you know exactly what I mean, when you simply have to satisfy the desire for that 'special' fast food item on your mind. There's only one thing you can do, ROAD TRIP!!<br /><br />Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) are feeling the need for their favorite White Castle hamburgers and the only 24 hour location is miles away across town. This film chronicles the madcap happenings while on their incredible journey to satisfy their gastronomic appetite. The scenes with Neil Patrick Harris as Stoner Neil Patrick Harris are a scream!<br /><br />Sometimes Hilarious, Sometimes Silly, Overall Satisfying.</p></body></html>

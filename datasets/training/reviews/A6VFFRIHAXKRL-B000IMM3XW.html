<meta name="summary" content="A movie with a good cast & new talent 7.5/10part 2 on X Men Blu Ray reviews"></head><body><p>I used to watch The X Men animated show back in the early to late 90's I always wondered what a live action movie would be like in 2000 we found out it stared Hugh Jackman as Wolverine Patrick Stewart as Professor X Ian McKellen as Magneto & Tyler Mane as Sabertooth which was 1 of Mane's 1st big roles. On with the story Magneto wants to start a Human Mutant war he wants to infect humans with a plague that can mutate & kill them they also used it on Senator Robert Kelly & he died. He also finds out about this girl named Rouge who has bonded with Wolverine he's like a father to her when Wolverine is sleeping he is having flashbacks of a war he can't rember his past Rouge is checking on him & he accidentally sticks a claw into her side she uses her power & steals Wolverine's instant healing ability. Mystique a shape shifter & 1 of Magneto's people that she isn't wanted she feels responsible & runs away. Wolverine joins the X Men there going to stop Magneto & save Rouge.</p></body></html>

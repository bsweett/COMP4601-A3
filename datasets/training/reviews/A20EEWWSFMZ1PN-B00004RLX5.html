<meta name="summary" content="Do you think Spock should change his mind?"></head><body><p>A space probe is approaching earth. Its requests are causing great havoc. They can not be answered. That is unless Kirk and his crew can go back in time to fetch the intended parties.<br /><br />Of all of the post series original movies, this one captures the essence of the series best. Yes it carries an important message, as that is the purpose of sci-fi. The technology is consistent with the series. And the charters conform to type.<br /><br />But what makes this movie stand out is the character interaction. You have seen it many times in episodes like [Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 28: "The City on the Edge of Forever" (1966).] Oh, you say that was history but it was also love, not humor. O.K. how about "Spocko" and Kirk trying to drive in the twenties [Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 49: "A Piece of the Action" (1966).] Yes you say there are exceptions but it would never happen on the enterprise. What little you know. [Star Trek - The Original Series, Episode 42: "The Trouble with Tribbles" (1966)] and there are quite a few more examples.<br /><br />I will not bring up all the fun scenes as it is more fun to watch them unfold. There is a lot of trivia that make this film interesting. What I found interesting was the scenes at the Institute in Alameda, because I was there and it is really the Monterey aquarium.<br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Now as with all major and a few minor films, we have the Blu-ray high definition revolution. By the time, you read this review Blu-ray is the norm so I will not regurgitate the technical details.<br /><br />However, you can see all kinds of details as the differences in Kirk's hair firm top to bottom, and someone wearing shoulder pads that are indicative of the 80's.</p></body></html>

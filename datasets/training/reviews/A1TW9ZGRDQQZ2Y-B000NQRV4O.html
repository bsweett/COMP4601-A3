Most of the film is just four characters talking to each other throughout the 1 hour and 40 minute running time. I thought this kind of film would bore me to tears, but thankfully most of the dialogue was clever and the acting really made this film shine. Jude Law and Julia Roberts were pretty good, but innocent looking Natalie Portman was great in her first mature performance. Clive Owen is what made this movie for me. He is probably best know for his recent film "King Arthur" and will be seen in "Sin City" coming out this Friday. He deserved the Oscar he was nominated for in my opinion (but I'm glad Morgan Freeman finally got one). I like the way he just takes apart Jude Law at the end, reducing him to tears and leaving in defeat. Didn't think I would like this one, but I am happy to say that it is worthy of a rental next time you are in the mood for a relationship/betrayal drama.</p></body></html>

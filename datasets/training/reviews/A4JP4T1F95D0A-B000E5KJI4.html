Pitt did a very credible job, and I though Bana was excellent.  Overall, I would say the acting was well above par, and the battles were fantastic.  While the story does deviate a little from the written work, it stays fairly true to the Homer epic.  The extras are also very interesting, so they are certainly worth a watch.</p></body></html>

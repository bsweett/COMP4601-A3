<meta name="summary" content="Tense and complicated story of a female vigilante"></head><body><p>I didn't expect much from this 2007 film.  But Jodie Forster was in it and she's such a fine actor that I love seeing her work on the screen.  She's cast as a vigilante who takes out revenge on all the bad guys who come her way.  The acting is so good, however, that I soon forgot that this was a formula film.  Jodie Forster seems to actually live the psychological terror and helplessness that befall her after her fiance is brutally beaten to death as they walk their dog in Central Park.  Yes, the bad guys are all stereotyped.  I expected that.  And it reflects a scary New York of random violence that existed about 15 years ago and which is different today.  But it didn't take me long to relate to her and, to the director's credit, he kept the scenes short so they didn't weigh down the film.  Terrance Howard, cast as an understanding cop, is someone I admire too.  As the bad guys start dropping he soon becomes suspicious and his relationship with Forster is tense and complicated.<br /><br />Even though I knew the general outline of the plot, I was never bored for a minute.  This is not a great film,  but has great acting and a fast paced plot. I certainly recommend it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A WORLD WITHOUT BABIES"></head><body><p>Alfonso Cuaron's treatment of P.D. James futuristic novel is a stylish exercise, a cautionary tale filmed with professional care and finesse, but it's also a dark, violent story with no resolve or emotional satisfaction.<br /><br />It's 2027 in England, in a world where a child hasn't been born in twenty years...why we're never told, but it is a world replete with revolutionary uprisings and unflinching bias.<br /><br />Clive Owen plays Theo, a young man who is approached by a former lover, who is now a "terrorist" (Julianne Moore in a very surprisingly brief appearance) to help her smuggle a young pregnant girl to safety.  Double crosses and tragedy ensue.  Michael Caine steals his scenes as a kind of "hippie" friend who aids and abets.  While visually stunning and well acted, the movie isn't as satisfying as one would expect and it's grim outlook is rather unsettling although provocative.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Love This Movie."></head><body><p>I really do love this movie.  I think Starship Troopers is a great action packed movie.  I thought the movie had an interesting idea instead of blowing up a major city such as London or New York, they picked Buenos Aires. The storyline was interesting it was about a bug race trying to eliminate us. This movie released in 1997 grossed 54 million dollars and it cost 95 million to make.  This is a violent film and has sexuality in it.  It is not recommended for children.  The DVD is good but it should be a lot better.</p></body></html>

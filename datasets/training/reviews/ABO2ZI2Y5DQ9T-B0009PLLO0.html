Oliver Stone should have done it much earlier, and then this film could have a chance at the box-office.<br /><br />Oliver Stone's cherished idea of bringing the life of Alexander onto the screen has finally realized.  Very aptly, the film runs almost 3 hours.  And it cost estimated $150,000,000, or more.  And, look! the ominous figures on the box-office records, that tell you the film only collected $34,000,000 at the time of writing.  It seems as if audiences sensed something terrible before the thaatres, and run away from there.<br /><br />[IS THIS THAT BAD?] That's eaxctly what you want to know.  I find the film is not that bad.  There are a few thing that I can recommend about the film, but still it is awfully self-indulgent and extremely verbose.  Let me point out these things one by one.<br /><br />[GOOD THINGS] are the spectacular battle scenes and beautifully recreated costumes.  Everyone would agree with the opinion that the film's highest point is the thrilling sequences about The Battle of Gaugamela, in which the troops of Alexander see the bloody fight against the Perusian armies.  These scenes are well-crafted, and the sweeping camera gives you the extraordinary vision, overlooking the battlefield.<br /><br />[BUT SOME THINGS] are ... well, really, embarrassingly, awful.  First, acting.  Colin Farrell as Alexander shows the limitation of his skills, especially in the latter half of the film, where the king gradually gets more and more obsessed with his dream.  In this film, 'obssessed' means a wide-eyed face and the constantly yelling voice, which are both irritatinig.  No wonder the soldiers lost faith, and wanted to go home.<br /><br />[WORST PRIZE], however, goes to super-campy Angelia Jolie, whose career seems keeping on a constant downward trip since two 'Tomb Raider's.  Now, Angelina plays the mother of Alexander, whose idea of reincarnation leads to her eccentric  belief -- and equally eccentric acting -- holding a snake before the terrified boy, teaching the dangers of the real life.  Instead of being convinced, the little boy must have been busy surpressing laughs before her.  (Sorry folks, but I laughed.)  And her phoney accent is a misguided idea.<br /><br />There are more bad things about the film, but they have already been pointed out by other reviewers, so I only say that I agree with them whole-heartedly.  Overlength, pointlessness, meandering story, too much talking, and very dull Anthony Hopkins whose character actually try to 'teach' us.  Supports from Jared Leto, Christopher Plummer, Rosalio Dawson, and Val Kilmer are all nothing.<br /><br />My advice: read books instead.</p></body></html>

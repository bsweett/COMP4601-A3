<meta name="summary" content="agonizingly brilliant"></head><body><p>This is very full portrait of the end of Hitler's regime.  Ganz (who is half-Jewish) is completely convincing as the declining, self-deluding, vicious Hitler.  You watch him as he loses touch with reality, first in ignoring reports that are not to his liking, then in placing ridiculous hopes in gambles and deus ex machina scenarios.  He seems quite human until he orders meaningless executions of the disloyal, who know the end is coming.<br /><br />Most interesting, however, are the characters around him.  The story is told from the point of view of one of his secretaries, who states, perhaps disingenuously, that she was not a committed Nazi, but came to almost love Hitler the man - he earns her loyalty through kindness.  THere are also the Goebbels, whose wife and children come off as rather sympathetic, symbolic in many ways of the self-destructiveness of the German elite.  Deep in the bunker, they live in a kind of parallel universe, a mythological kingdom in which everything still seems possible.  Eva Brown works hard to keep everyone's spirits up in ironically frivolous dances while the guards are drinking themselves senseless.  Meanwhile, the Soviets are pressing closer and closer.<br /><br />This is excellent historical drama, stimulating the viewer to want to discover more.  Warmly recommended.</p></body></html>

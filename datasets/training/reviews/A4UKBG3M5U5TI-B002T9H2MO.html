<meta name="summary" content="Space Oddity"></head><body><p>"Moon" stars Sam Rockwell as Sam Bell, an employee of a moon-based energy company called Lunar.  Sam lives in an isolated base that controls three massive "harvesters," which travel across the surface of the moon to collect rocks containing Helium-3.  His only companion is a large robot named Gerty (voiced by Kevin Spacey) who looks like a copy machine suspended from the ceiling.  Gerty also has a screen that displays emoticons to express his feelings.  With his three-year contract nearly up, Sam is preparing to return to earth and the loving arms of his wife and new-born daughter, both of whom we see in video calls.  However, Sam has an accident while trying to attend to one of the harvesters, and he wakes up confused in the infirmary.  Gerty tells him that he was unconscious for only a short time; however, Gerty is acting rather oddly (his emoticon's eyes do that darting back forth thing that cartoon characters do when they lie).  Is he lying?<br /><br />First time director Duncan Jones (AKA Zowie Bowie - the son of David Bowie) helmed this indie sci-fi flick with a meager $5 million dollar budget, or roughly the amount "Avatar" spent on bagels for the craft services table.  Nevertheless, the film's look and effects are quite believable.  Scenes on the moon were filmed with models overlayed with CGI, which gives them a fairly realistic look.  Written by Jones with Nathan Parker, The plot has some predictable elements (a meddling evil company, a lying robot).  However, the story manages to hold some surprises and intelligently explores Rockwell's predicament.  To borrow a line from his father's first hit single, Jones "really made the grade" with his debut.<br /><br />Jones wrote the movie for Sam Rockwell.  I'm not a fan of Rockwell's work but he definitely brings something different to the role as a twitchy astronaut who (to borrow from another song) finds that "it's lonely out in space."  [Actually, now that I think about it, Elton John's "Rocket Man" is much better description of "Moon" than is "Space Oddity."]  One of my favorite parts of sci-fi films is the robots, and I loved Gerty and his emoticon face.  Spacey's vocals strike the perfect balance between a human-sounding robot and still sounding vaguely ominous (apparently his vocals were altered slightly).  Another major strength is the haunting score by Clint Mansell, which manages to highlight and elevate key scenes without being the least bit intrusive.  I enjoyed "Moon" and was happy to read that Jones is planning a follow-up of sorts called "Mute," which will explore another story set in this timeline.<br /><br />The DVD is packed with extras including two commentaries with the director (one with the writer/producer and another with members of the technical crew) and several behind the scenes making of flicks.</p></body></html>

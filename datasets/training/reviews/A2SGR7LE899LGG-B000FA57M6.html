The overall ambience is very, very dark (literally) and it tends to drag slightly somewhere in the middle. Also, there are many sequences that borrow heavily from the 1986 movie -ALIENS-, but nevertheless I was pleased with the overall rendition (the first person shooting sequence is very intriguing). Overall: DECENT to GOOD! (more like 3.5 stars)</p></body></html>

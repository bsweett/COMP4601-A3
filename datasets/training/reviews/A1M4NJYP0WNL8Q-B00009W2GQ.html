After watching this it's easy to see that the seams dividing the three films are primarily there to provide logical breaks between the movies, not because they are needed.  This is really one very long film and several of the themes only come to fruition here.  It is time for the rebels to hunker down for the last defense of Zion and for Neo to quest for a solution that doesn't involve ending life entirely.<br /><br />Simple things first.  This film is a masterpiece of CGI, choreography, and stagecraft.  Not simply because there are a lot of detailed evil critters running around waving tentacles, but because the animators have taken great care to make sure that the critters work together flawlessly.  Battle scenes such as the defense of Zion are remarkable because of their vastness and the cruel beauty of the conflict.  And the fight work, especially the final grand conflict between Neo and Smith is equally compelling.  In the previous episode, I found the fighting a bit repetitious, but here everything is so under control that it appears effortless and natural.<br /><br />Another thing the Wachowski's do very well here is shift between realities so well that by the end one isn't quite sure which events are happening in what layer of perception.  Our only hints are when Neo starts talking to Trinity about The Light.  This affirms there is something beneath the surface, even if we aren't sure what it is.  It isn't really the machines on the other side of this struggle, it's Agent Smith who has become Neo's alter ego as bringer of the dark.  All of this forces the viewer to accept everything as real, which is exactly the right state for viewing.<br /><br />One of the layers of symbolism I found lurking in this film, unlike the pseudo-symbolism built up by the choices of names, is the steady, low-key series of Arthurian references.  Much like the story of the Once and Future King this the story of hope broken and then rebuilt on the bones of failure and tragedy.  It isn't until the ending sequences that Wachowski's take their gloves of and hit you over the head with Arthur/Neo, but it works quite well in context.<br /><br />Obviously I liked this film much better than Matrix Reloaded.  I'm not going to pretend that the film is a literary masterpiece, but it does a great job of demonstrating that action/adventure can be a lot more than brain numbing hack, kick, and slash.  Two hours of total escapism.  Yippee!</p></body></html>

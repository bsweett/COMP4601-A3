<meta name="summary" content="Great mystery, very good film, but the book's tone is superior"></head><body><p>A supernatural thriller seen through a Federal Marshall's perspective, "Shutter Island" is a suspenseful edge-of-the-seat movie. A brisk pace helps heighten the tension, as U. S. Marshals Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Ruffalo) are sent to Shutter Island, an Alcatraz Island for the criminally insane, to investigate the mysterious - and seemingly impossible - disappearance/escape of a beautiful female patient, Rachel Solando (Mortimer) from Ashcliffe Hospital. As the two uncover further clues and interview the physicians and staff, they quickly realize Shutter Island has skeletons in the closet, a possible background of illegal and experimental treatments on patients, and the misleading facts about the facility are hindered by hospital medical personal who are not telling the whole truth.<br /><br />Parallels can be drawn to various other suspense thrillers - most notably <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BRZ5J2">The Sixth Sense</a> - but they're not so obvious as to belie the paranoia or to minimize the success of the intricately twisted psychological storyline. Determining the villains and truths is the primary enjoyment while watching Scorsese's interpretation of Dennis Lehane's novel.  The plot and lack of action causes the movie to drag at times, and the ominous feeling desired by Scorsese is somewhat lacking.<br /><br />The acting, however, is top notch except for a few characters.  While DiCaprio is as intense as ever - and further displaying why he might be the best young actor of his generation - and Ruffalo is adept as his partner, the staff at Shutter Island, with the exception of Ben Kingsley as a caring, competent psychiatrist, are simply not enjoyable.  Ted Levin, someone I usually appreciate, is insignificant as the warden; John Carroll Lynch is just as bland as the Deputy Warden.  And Max von Sydow may as well have looked into the camera and whispered, "I'm cashing this one in."  There are two bright spots, however, and they are Jackie Earle Haley as patient/prisoner George Noyce, and Elias Koteas as Laeddis.  While Koteas is scary, and his makeup job memorable, it's Haley who deserves recognition.  Just like his performance as Rorschach in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FB55H6">Watchmen</a>, he steals the show when he's on screen.  Seen in a dark, filthy cell, he delivers a chilling warning with the passion of someone who actually might be crazy.  Mesmerizing performance.<br /><br />There are a few minor differences from the book that can't be held against anyone involved with the movie.  Even though I really wanted a specific scene with an armed ferry to be included.  Overall, however, something else is definitely lacking.  I don't know if the hospital staff needs to be more evil, or the story needs to be more foreboding.  Either way, it didn't feel as terrifying as I expected it to be, despite the overall impressive quality of the film.  Accolades for cinematographer Robert Richardson (Inglourious Basterds, Aviator, Kill Bill 1 & 2, Casino) are deserved.  While the actors don't necessarily deliver consistently throughout the entire movie, the island itself stars in Richardson's capable hands.<br /><br />Overall, a very good movie, definitely worth seeing at the theater, but missing that je ne sais quoi.<br /><br />Jason Elin</p></body></html>

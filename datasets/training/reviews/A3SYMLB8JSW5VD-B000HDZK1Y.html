<meta name="summary" content="Lame Libre"></head><body><p>I like Jack Black as a actor. But Nacho Libre is as dull as dull can be. I wish I saw this at the movie. Never in a million would have purchased the DVD movie. The gags are lame and plot is stale. Pass over this zero and purchase a hero like School of Rock.</p></body></html>

Films to make you laugh, films well written, well acted, well edited, with great special effects and all star casts...<p>...but lets forget about them and talk about Monty Python and the Holy Grail.  There are simply not enough adjatives to adaquately describe this film.  It is thinking humor, it is slapstick humor, it is political humor, it is irrevant humor, it parodies Arthurian Legends (with a jab at ancient greece as well) documentaries, spectacles, and itself all in one package.  <p>  It does all of this on a shoestring budget and a cast basically consisting of the six pythons, and a few extras thrown on here and there for speciality scenes.<p>  This movie isn't so much watched as experienced.  For maximum viewing pleasure don't let anyone tell you about the film.  Let them sit you down, turn on the VCR and be amazed.<p>  Like A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO THE FORUM you will miss funny things if you don't watch it multiple times; Unlike FORUM it is not due to editing but do to little backround things that are easy to miss.  I think three viewings minimum are necessary to catch all of the backround stuff.  Of course if you are not Leonard Malton then you will watch this movie three times out of sheer pleasure.  If you haven't bought it yet, shame on you! Don't you know that people are starving in the BBC residuals department!</p></body></html>

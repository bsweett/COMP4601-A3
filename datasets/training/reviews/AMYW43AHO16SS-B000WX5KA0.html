<meta name="summary" content="DeNiro's finest performance!!"></head><body><p>I can go back to all the performances Robert DeNiro has made over the years, but I can honestly say that this was the best movie he ever worked in.  Yes, DeNiro as Jake Lamotta in &quot;Raging Bull&quot; was his shinning path to greatness, his portrayal of Travis Bickle was one that still leaves me with such chills.  Taxi Driver was one of Martin Scorsese's best movies.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Go on to see this underappreciated movie"></head><body><p>I hadn't seen this movie until a friend brought it over during our very impromptu 'girls night off'. It was so much more than I had expected and so much better too!<br /><br />Impatient to grow up in 1987, 13 year old Jenna Rink (Jennifer Garner) ultimately gets her wish. She then wakes up to discover that she is THE Jenna Rink---rich and connected magazine editor of 'Poise' magazine.<br /><br />In addition to being the same magazine that she had poured over as a kid, Jenna goes wild to learn that she is personal friend with Madonna of all people and owns a super cool loft packed with awesome clothes and has a very hunky professional athlete boyfriend! She's convinced that life cannot get any better.<br /><br />Upon further examination however, Jenna discovers material riches don't cover for emotional absence. Her successes came at the cost of abandoning family and friends The people who are around Jenna regularly tell her what they think she wants to hear and aren't actually her friends.<br /><br />Garner does a good job with the scripting material that she had to work with--the scripting holes are not her own fault. However, people at the magazine...etc don't seem to question why this allegedly high-powered and together power player is suddenly so spacey. If New York's publishing environment remains very cutthroat and the fictional magazine in this film was well-established, the company should have noticed something.<br /><br />The most solid character is the 'adult' Matt Flamhaff  (Mark Ruffalo) Jenna's childhood friend who is no where near as financially rich, but is emotionally happier having never forgot who he was or what he believed in.<br /><br />According to the film back story, Matt and Jenna had been friends, but drifted away. However (in one of the alternate realities ala 'Back to the Future') there is a very happy ending for the both of them.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Tour de Force performance from Hanks"></head><body><p>Max Allan Collins, the former writer of the Dick Tracy Comic Strip wrote the graphic novel this story was based on.  It this one Hank's character plays a hitman.  His son follows him one day with tragic results.  I don't want to give away too much. However it's a film that can be viewed more than once.  It doesn't lose any of it's impact.  I would like to read the graphic novel it's based on and the sequel.  I have to wonder if the sequel matches the power of the first story.<br /><br />If you are a Hanks fan or any type of film buff, this is one you'll never forget!</p></body></html>

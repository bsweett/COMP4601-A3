<meta name="summary" content="A Fresh and Fun Retelling of Paris During World War II"></head><body><p>Tarrentino brings World War II Paris to life in a new fashion.  A young Jewish girl escapes a search of a farmhouse by Nazis and makes her way to Paris.  Somehow she gets the identity of Emanuelle, an owner of one of the top Paris movie houses.  One day she is changing the titles on the marquee when she is approached by a young German soldier.  He becomes smitten with her but she tries being cold back to him to no avail.  It turns out he is somewhat of a big hero in Germany because he single handedly killed many enemy soldiers while being a sniper in a bell tower over a three day period.  Goebbels has made a propaganda movie starring the soldier as himself.  Later on the soldier comes up with the idea of showing the movie in Emanuelle's theater.<br /><br />The movie also focuses on a group of Jewish soldiers headed by a Tennessee leader (Brad Pitt) who infiltrate Nazi controlled areas and kill Nazis by either scalping them or leaving them to the Jew Bear with the bat (one of Pitt's men), also referred to as the Golem.  When Pitt's group ambushes Nazis he likes to always leave one man alive to tell the story of what happens.  The one left alive is not so lucky because Pitt will use a huge machete like knife to carve a swastika in the surviving German's forehead, to forever mark him as a Nazi.<br /><br />Tarrentino uses the "chapter" method used successfully in his Kill Bill films.  Along with that the ending of the film definately has the feel of a Tarrentino film.  Tarrentino does a remarkable job of shooting each chapter almost as a separate tale but each chapter converges by the end of the film.  Tarrentino does change history quite a bit but the movie is so good that the audience can forgive him and go along with how the movie turns out.<br /><br />A fresh and fun new telling of WW II.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Different but lacking- spoilerish review"></head><body><p>I saw this film purely on great buzz. It made many 'top 10' lists in 2008 and I was curious about this film that I'd never heard of. I never saw a trailer and all I had to go on was a couple of wonderful reviews and a small blurb of a synopsis.<br /><br />I am very open-minded when it comes to film. I love the horror genre as well as anything to do with vampires. And I usually like foreign horror. But I admit I was entirely dissapointed in Let The Right One In. It starts out promising but after that I felt nothing for the film, nor its characters.<br /><br />This is not a horror film and should not be labeled as such. I'm not even talking about shock and gore. I'm talking about atmosphere. It was lacking. There was no sense of foreboding, no real mystery, nothing that made your spine tingle.<br /><br />Yes, it is a romance of sorts and while it may be interesting in that regard, it still felt lacking. The main problem is that there is no backstory to the character of Eli. She is a vampire and she is 12 and has been for quite a while. That's all we know. I did some research after the film and found out from people that read the actual book what exactly happens to her. Her backstory sounded more heartbreaking than this entire film.<br />Without it, Eli was just a mysterious little vampire with an ambiguous past.<br /><br />The acting was pretty good and I thought the actors who portrayed Eli and the bullied Oskar did a great job in that regard. When Eli very briefly reveals something pretty darn important about her past, it is not questioned by Oskar for even a second. Not even the fact that she is a vampire deters him or makes him blink. Some would call that sweet and romantic. I would call it unrealstic in any case.<br /><br />I appreciate what the director was trying to accomplish, and maybe the actual book is very good, but as a movie, it feels very lacking and the ending leaves much to be desired. I swear Oskar's fate will be just like Eli's other caretaker/father/whatever he was supposed to be. And that is hardly what I would call a love story.<br /><br />Update: Apparently, in the US version of the dvd, the subtitles get dumbed down big time. I just read this article and while I am not buying this dvd, I think it's important to get this info out for those interested:<br /><br />http://iconsoffright.com/news/2009/03/let_the_wrong_subtitles_in_to.html</p></body></html>

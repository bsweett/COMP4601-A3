Richard Curtis has put together a fine film, showing the foibles of human nature, and the characters' reactions. I laughed often, reflected softly, and ultimately thought it is a treasure among those films that talk about "love". The stellar cast handles the material well, especially Bill Nighy, the over-the-hill rock singer. Liam Neeson, Hugh Grant, Laura Linney, Emma Thompson, and Colin Firth are all excellent.  It's very episodic, and the episodes with Mr. Firth are especially sweet. "Love Actually" won many awards, worldwide, but was ignored by the Academy. I laughed often, reflected quite a bit, and was allowed to put myself in touch with these wonderful characters. ALL love, or infatuation, is an enigma, and the "porn" couple really put it in perspective. I loved those two. Also, Neeson's son (I don't know his name) is one of the best kid-actors I've seen in a long time. It's a good ride, and loads of fun. Check it out!</p></body></html>

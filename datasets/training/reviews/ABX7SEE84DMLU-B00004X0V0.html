<meta name="summary" content="Ruthlessly Original"></head><body><p>I love this film.<br /><br />This movie has more satirical content than any other sci-fi parody I'd ever seen before.<br /><br />It's great to see the interplay between Wil Smith and Tommy Lee Jones here.  What a great pairing - such mutual respect and high regard.<br /><br />Make sure to look out for the "near cameo" appearance of Tony Shaloub near the beginning of the film.  Was growing a new head the reason for Monk's OCD?<br /><br />The sequel was nowhere near this original.  Enjoy it, even if you're not a big sci-fi fan!</p></body></html>

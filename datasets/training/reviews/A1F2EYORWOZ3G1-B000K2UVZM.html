<meta name="summary" content="Not what I had hoped for"></head><body><p>I've read the other reviews and they are right.<br /><br />I was greatly disappointed in this movie. Mostly because I expect so much more from De Palma. He has turned out such classics in the genre as 'Dressed to Kill', 'Body Double' and 'Snake Eye' that I was eager to see how he handled the case of the Black Dahlia.<br /><br />In the end he does pull it all together and packages it up for you. However, this movie meanders and actually avoids the subject of the murder. It became so far from the point that I was actually considering turning it off. But I kept going out of curiosity.<br /><br />The plot of this movie grows so many branches it becomes difficult to track so you need to pay very close attention .... even during the boring parts.<br /><br />This movie is based in the true story of Betty Short. Therefore liberties are limited. It would appear that works of fiction play out better for De Palma.</p></body></html>

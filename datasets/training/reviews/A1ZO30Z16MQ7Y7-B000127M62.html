<meta name="summary" content="Great film."></head><body><p>This was a really cool film with a sweet fight at the end. The only problem is that they ignored some things about the chrarctor of Jason. It said in Jason goes to hell that Jason was really a worm demon thing. In this it say's he kill's people because everyone picked on him. Besides that, Freddy vs Jason was one of the best film's of the year. I liked Jason X and New Nightmare better than this. Worth your money.</p></body></html>

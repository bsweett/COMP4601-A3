<meta name="summary" content="Real life drama"></head><body><p>A young woman has to locate her father after he has skipped out on his bail. She, her mother, and her siblings are in danger of being evicted from their home. A realistic look at the hardscrabble life of those living in the dirt poor Appalachian region, where drug labs are common, and the locals struggle to get by. No significant dramatic turns, or action sequences, but a powerful look at the difficulty faced by a girl who is trying to keep her family together in spite of the problems presented by her absent father.</p></body></html>

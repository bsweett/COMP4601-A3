<meta name="summary" content="one of the best films ever made"></head><body><p>Casablanca currently ranks 3 or 4 on my list of best films ever made. The performances are flawless. Curtiz's direction is flawless. The story is great. Max Steiner's score is great. There is almost nothing bad that can be said about this film. And most of the world will agree that this movie belongs in the top five films ever made. <p>That being said, why isn't there a special edition dvd? This contains a documentary 'You Must Remember This' hosted by Lauren Bacall. But why isn't there a dvd like Citizen Kane's Special editions, with all kinds of documentaries, featurettes, essays, and commentary by film historians? A definite hindsite by Warne Brothers. One I hope they rectify.</p></body></html>

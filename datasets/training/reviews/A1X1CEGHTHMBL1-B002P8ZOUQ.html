<meta name="summary" content="As a fan of X-Men, I love this movie!"></head><body><p>I have been an X-Men fan since I was a child. Wolverine was always the toughest one around and he carried an attitude to match. Hugh Jackman plays the role to perfection and this movie is a great synopsis of the origins of one of the X-Men and one of my personal favorite characters.<br /><br />Wolverine and his brother are invincible warriors and their amazing healing powers make these mutants able to heal quickly, stay in the fight and maybe even immortal! The US government uses them and modifies them to enhance their fighting capabilities and the result is scary. Wolverine is out for vengeance and no one had better stand in his way.<br /><br />Wolverine's brother is played by Liev Schreiber who does a wonderful job fulfilling the role as a real bad dude without many moral ethics of doing whatever he wants to win. He makes a good villain to Wolverine's vision quest to regain his lost past. In the end Sabertooth, (Liev Schreiber) does just enough to help his brother against a common foe!<br /><br />I love this movie for the storyline and the great special effects. It helps you to understand Wolverine's personality, special skills and his amnesia about his past. I hope the X-Men saga continues in more movie releases. They are great!</p></body></html>

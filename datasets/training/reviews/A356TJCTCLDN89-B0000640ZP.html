<meta name="summary" content="brilliant"></head><body><p>The Others is a remarkable film. There is no crazed axe murderer. The are no car chases. There are no naked ladies and no lame jokes. In short, it's one of the few movies for grown folks that hit the theaters last year. <p>Nicole Kidman gives a performance as Grace, the mother, that will stop people from saying, "Oh yeah, Tom Cruise's ex wife," once and for all. Kidman shows that she's an A-list actress and not just a gorgeous face. <p>The character, Grace is a complicated woman. It's obvious from the first moment we see her that she's just barely hanging on. Her children have a life threatening condition and can not be exposed to sun light. Her daughter is angry with her. Her estate is lonely and no one ever comes to visit. Her husband is at war. Her nerves are shot and it's just a matter of time before she cracks. And then weird things start happening...Is someone trying to scare Grace or is she imagining all this?<br />The ending, which I won't give away completely shocked me. It's the last thing you'd expect and explains everything that's gone on in the film perfectly.<br />If you like your horror to be in the Shirley Jackson mode  or if you're just a Kidman fan this movie is for you.</p></body></html>

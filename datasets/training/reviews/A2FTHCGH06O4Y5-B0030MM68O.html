Notice how as things are getting tenser, the cuts become quicker?<br /><br />Seems to capture what I imagine to be a characteristic of life in an EOD team, and in war generally:  nail-biting tension as you think something's going to happen, then nothing happens.  Then, no tension, then something unexpected happens.  Rarely do expectation and reality seem to converge.<br /><br />After watching this, danged if you don't feel like you were embedded in a sapper group in Iraq for a couple of weeks!<br /><br />UPDATE:  I was stunned last night to see this movie receive at least two major Oscars:  directing and picture.  Holy cow!  What a shame:  though no big fan of the anti-American "Avatar," that film was a lot better than this.  This one had forgettable characters and what little plot there was was confusing.  It was an underdog at the Oscars.  But the thing often forgotten about underdogs is that they're underdogs for a reason:  they're usually correctly perceived as inferior.  This is a movie I would never dream of seeing again, yet it won those Oscars!?  Reminds me a bit of 1977:  "Annie Hall" won for Best Picture, but that movie is forgotten now.  "Star Wars," like "Avatar," went home with only a couple of technical Oscars.</p></body></html>

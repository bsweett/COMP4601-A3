<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing"></head><body><p>I expect better from a movie starring Harrison Ford. He is forced to steal from the bank he works for because a high tech criminal has kidnapped his family. It doesn't go smoothly because recent changes has been made so Ford has to think quick on his feet. As expected, Ford saves his family due to a fortunate circumstance.<br /><br />I found the plot trite and there was only a couple of mildly exciting scenes. I suggest skipping this dud.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="No frills, but the best way to watch this movie yet"></head><body><p>...If all you want is to watch the movie.<br /><br />(Note: This is a review of the SUPERBIT version of this movie, though Amazon, in their infinite stupidity, will probably cross-post it to EVERY version of Lawrence and confuse the hell out of everybody.)<br /><br />Back in the days of watching movies squeezed onto squareish TV screens, watching Lawrence of Arabia always represented a compromise.  In fact, after an attempt or two I declared it unwatchable in that format and had to wait for theater revivals and eventually the large wide-screen TV and advent of DVD.  But now that I have those items I still have to compromise and keep two versions of Lawrence on my shelf--the standard two-disc set for all the featurettes, commentaries, and other goodies, and this two-disc Superbit edition for the movie itself.  For this version represents the clearest picture you are going to get, outside of Blu-ray or a 70mm cinema print.  There are no extras here because every inch of space on the discs is devoted to the picture and sound, which is the point.  So if you both love this movie and love all the annotation that goes with it, you have to own two version of this film.  It's as simple as that.<br /><br />The picture here is sharper than the standard DVD, and the colors are slightly more natural, not as saturated, with more definition in the hues.  But it's the *sound* where I heard the biggest improvement.  It's much fuller than the standard DVD, far less "tinny," and I probably don't need to tell you how vital Maurice Jarre and the London Philharmonic Orchestra are to the film.  (Bit of trivia: despite what the credits say, Adrian Boult did not conduct one bar of the film.  He had to always be credited as the conductor of the LPO for contractual reasons, but in fact Jarre conducted the score in the film.  If you knew anything about how Boult conducted, you'd know the poor chap couldn't in a million years master the techniques required for film music.)<br /><br />I'm not going to review the story, acting, cinematography, etc., here, save to say they're all extraordinary and make this film easily one of the greatest of all time.  But of course, if you're looking at this more expensive Superbit presentation you surely already know that.  The question on your minds is, do you need this version if you already have the standard-version DVD.  The answer for me is definitely yes, especially if you're watching Lawrence, as you should, on a large-screen TV with a good sound system.  Few films deserve *and* truly require the white glove treatment as much as this.  Next to it, Kubrick's 2001 A Space Odyssey, made just a few years later and undoubtedly influenced to some extent by Lean's epic, seems like an intimate short.</p></body></html>

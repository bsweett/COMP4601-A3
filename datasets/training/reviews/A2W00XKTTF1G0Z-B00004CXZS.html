<meta name="summary" content="Kahn Rules - Or Tries Too..."></head><body><p>After the disappointing release of Star Trek:The Motion Picture, "The Wrath Of Kahn" was a great delight to see.<p>Filled with action, adventure and darma. All perfomances, even William Statner's were incredible. Spock and McCoy were finally Spock and McCoy. The Enterprise finally had color and lights and the unforms were more space fairing then the pajamas in the first one.<p>Nicholas Meyer, who I met shortly after this production in the 80's, described this as an adventure will characters moving the story and drama not the special effects. There's energy, humor, drama and even death.<p>The Genesis Device proves to be an icon for the whole underling story. And, as far as special effects go, in 1982 - they were the best. Visual candy for the eye.<p>Cudos to the supporting cast (espeically Deforest "McCoy" Kelly and James "Scotty" Doohan) and of corse Ricardo "Kahn" Mauntalban - there's an actors, actor. Even the Goodbye scene for Shatner and Nimoy (Spock) was heartfelt and real.<p>This is my second favorite of the Star Trek features. (USed to be the first until Star Trek IV:The Voyage Home!) Warp speed this one into your collection! (The original trailers are fun to watch too!)</p></body></html>

The acting is very good, and I love the realism that each actor shows, making Alien a terrifying film to watch. I wouldn't go far to say that one of them stood out the most as I thought all of the players did equally well. One wonderful aspect about Alien is its cinematography, and it's visually pleasant. The biggest problem of Alien is its pacing which can be slow and boring at times. I know it's attributable to the suspense factor, but it's an area that requires a masterful skill. Considering the films Ridley Scott had made over the years, Alien is the best work of his career, and it's worthy of any top ten list when it comes to science fiction and horror movies. Some scenes are quite scary but not in macabre or grotesque way...just real terror. It's a rare accomplishment though. One more thing that I found problematic in Alien is the overuse of flashing lights. That was needlessly too much and overdone. If that was reduced while some fixing up of the pace, Alien would have earned a `10' in my book. Looking at the underlying aspects of Alien, I loved how the feminism is played out, especially when Sigourney Weaver's character is asserting the need of adherence to militarism protocol to ensure safety of everyone on the ship. Of course, when that was ignored, Alien the movie began. The way everybody acted is right on the money and is perfect; when I think of the crew members of Jason X and of Alien, there is a superb chasm of difference what makes a movie great. Alien is 2001: A Space Odyssey meets Invasion of the Body Snatchers in And Then There Were None fashion with a different kind of a creature thrown in. Before there was The Thing and before there was Predator, Alien appeared. The idea of a female hero is unique when Alien was made, and it's a turning point. All in all, Alien is a must-see sci-fic horror classic that is almost a masterpiece and is stunning in all accounts. The rating of `9' stays the same.</p></body></html>

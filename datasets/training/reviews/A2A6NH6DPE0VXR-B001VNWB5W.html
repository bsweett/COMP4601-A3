<meta name="summary" content="It's not for everyone, but I loved it"></head><body><p>An ex-group of heroes find themselves back together after one of their own is killed. They teamed up in the 60's but now it's the 80's and super heroes are outlawed by President Nixon.<br /><br />  Now Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) is out to bring them back together. While Dr. Manhattan, the only one with actual powers isn't even sure whether he wants to give up on humans or not. His girlfriend Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) is his only link to humanity.<br /><br />  However since Dr. Manhattan's so obsessed with his work, he's pushing Spectre into the arms of Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson of Lakeview Terrace). But it's a bad time for Manhattan to give up on humans since bombs are about to drop and he's the only chance in stopping them.<br /><br />  The movie is often brutally violent and disturbing even. It's far darker than Sin City and the Dark Knight. So don't expect a totally fun super hero adventure. Just expect a complicated but entertaining movie. It has it's share of fun action but some might find that it doesn't have enough action. I still found it fascinating though with some great visuals.<br /><br />  I didn't really care that there was a lot of talk. I loved the characters and the performances. Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Supernatural season 1, Grey's Anatomy), gives a star making performance like many reviews have said. However, I think Patrick Wilson is also surprisingly excellent as a former hero who won't admit that he misses doing it. While he has excellent chemistry with Malin Akerman.<br /><br />  Jackie Earle Haley's performance is a little under-rated as well, some critics didn't like it anyway. Yes, he sounds a lot like Christian Bale's Batman when he talks. Yet, he still probably gives the most engaging performance in the movie next to Billy Crudup. He totally owned the character as well.</p></body></html>

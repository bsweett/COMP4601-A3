I would have made the problem with U North clear and a bit more direct so it would have more of an impact on the viewer;<br />2.  remove part of the beginning which actually shows much of the ending. This device works well in some films, but not so much in this one.<br />3.  perhaps spent less time or no time at all on Clayton's son and brother; their side stories don't have all that much relevance and take up time unnecessarily.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is a solid legal thriller, with Clooney and, in particular, Tom Wilkinson giving some great performances amidst all the intrigue.  The scenes of Wilkinson being ambushed and drugged, and those showing Clooney being pursued and nearly blown up are quite harrowing.  Producer and director Sydney Pollack has become an excellent actor in his own right, as well.</p></body></html>

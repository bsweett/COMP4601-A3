I asked my friends, "How on earth can you screw up making a Godzilla movie?"<br /><br />But they did.<br /><br />I was asking the same question when I saw THE HULK.  But the answer came a little easier: the filmmakers wanted to make MORE of the story than there was.  Get into the Hulk's inner child and psychology.  Blah, blah, psycho-blah.<br /><br />We want to see the Hulk throw more tanks.<br /><br />We want to see him foil villians who try to use him for their own nefarious purposes.<br /><br />You've got hundreds of comic books and dozens of TV shows to cobble a cool plot from.<br /><br />You blew it.<br /><br />And...that...just...makes me...ANGRY!<br /><br />You killed a movie franchise faster than Joel Schummacher.</p></body></html>

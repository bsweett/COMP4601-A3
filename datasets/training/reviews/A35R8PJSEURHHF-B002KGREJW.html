<meta name="summary" content="Wow, epic, not"></head><body><p>Is this a remake of the Griswalds vacation to Wally World?  Hello, it's the same thing, family takes road trip; there is mom and dad, grandfather, son, and daughter in a dysfunctional family.  The grandfather dies on the way.  Notice any similarities yet?  Vehicle breaks down...etc.......could go on.<br /><br />with that aside, it's not a bad movie, it's just that it's not that great.  Characters were annoying and unbelievable.  A goth son wanting to fly jets? wierd, whatever. I don't see this movie breaking any new ground in what it is presenting.</p></body></html>

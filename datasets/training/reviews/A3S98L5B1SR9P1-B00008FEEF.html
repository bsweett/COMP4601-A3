<meta name="summary" content="Halloween II"></head><body><p>I've always read that Halloween 4 is thought to be the best sequel. HARDLY (in my opinion).<br /><br />This film picks right up where the first one left off. If you thought the first one was good, this one is amazing. After he is shot by Dr. Loomis at the end of Halloween, Michael Meyers disappears and part two follows the search for him through the neighborhood and to the local hospital. There, he stalks and kills the staff on his way to Laurie, who is a patient there due to her wounds in the first Halloween. If you liked the first Halloween, you'll love Halloween II. If you're planning on going to see the latest Halloween film, do yourself a favor and go rent part II and stay at home.</p></body></html>

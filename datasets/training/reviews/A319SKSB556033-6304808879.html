<meta name="summary" content="Raise some hell on Blu Ray"></head><body><p>Of the many horror franchises that endured through the 80s and 90s Hellraiser, surely, has the most sequels (I think we're up to part 10 now). The mythology, and point, may have been lost on the long line of successive filmmakers who took up the reigns after Clive Barker's departure, but the original film remains a true, hardcore, nose-to-the-grindstone horror that is completely unafraid to do whatever it wants.<br /><br />The story has Larry Cotton and his wife Julia move into the old family home (in what seems to be England, but no one is speaking with an English accent) where his wayward brother Frank appeared to have been staying before mysteriously taking off. Little do they know that Frank's soul is imprinted on the walls of the attic and brought back to life, in a skeletal, barely human capacity, when Larry spills his blood on the floor. Frank and Julia rekindle a fling they once had as he begs her to help him restore his human body, by luring naive wannabe lovers, for him to feed on before the Cenobites discover he's escaped their dimension of eternal pain/pleasure.<br /><br />What impresses me most with Hellraiser is that everything is done before the camera. All the blood and make-up effects are cheap but utterly convincing. If it were made today it would be nothing more than a CGI-crapfest that would horrify no one, but the raw, ugly visuals and unfiltered cinematography elevate Hellraiser far, far above the trash that passes itself for horror these days.<br /><br />Chris Young also provides a glorious score, which may well be the best horror film score of all time. It's absolutely amazing stuff and I highly recommend that you check out the Hellraiser score CD. It gives the film an extra edge and a touch of timeless class. Despite being made in the 80s, Hellraiser has barely dated and looks much better than modern horror films with 50 times the budget.<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks and sounds great with a 1.85:1 1080p picture and Dolby TrueHD 5.1. A decent amount of extras are included.</p></body></html>

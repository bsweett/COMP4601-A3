I was looking forward to that movie so much and I was let down SOOOO much by the sloppy construction, poor visuals, ridiculous scripting and overall messy structure.  The reason I was looking forward to it was because, as many have already stated (critics alike), `Spider-Man 2' is probably the best superhero movie EVER!<br /><br />Plot holes or not, I still slightly prefer `The Dark Knight' (I love my superheroes to have a little grit on them).<br /><br />Where `Spider-Man' was a nicely constructed origin story, `Spider-Man 2' becomes a brilliantly orchestrated expansion on that origin, complete with a profound moral structure that elevates the film from a mere `comic book movie'.  With a solid script that really gets to the heart of the characters and makes them real and relatable, `Spider-Man 2' is an outstanding film, no matter what genre you place it in.  It has layer upon layer of interesting and memorable development.<br /><br />The film is, in a word, very complex (but that is a good thing).<br /><br />Picking up where the first film left off, Peter Parker is struggling to accept who he has become.  He still suffers from guilt, but he has masked that guilt with a newfound responsibility.  That responsibility is making it very difficult for Peter to strike a needed balance between his personal life and that of being Spider-Man.  This is making his budding romance with Mary Jane Watson more aggravating than it should be.  His past actions (involving a certain flying villain) have posed a threat to Peter's relationship with his best friend Harry, who has vowed to avenge his father's death.  When you add to that a brilliant man controlled by his own genius (a marvelous Alfred Molina), you have a recipe for some exciting and provoking entertainment.<br /><br />And that is JUST what `Spider-Man 2' proves to be.<br /><br />Sam Raimi is at his very best here.  What I admire so much about this film is that, while Raimi definitely `goes there' in the visual department, he never goes so far that the film appears fake.  That was one of my biggest issues with that Spider-Mess of a third film.  Everything was SOOOO computer animated that it came off like a really bad video game.  Not so here.  Sure, there is a lot going on, but everything maintains a crisp, slickness to it that establishes a sense of realism.  Yes, I know that it is improbable that a tentacle clad man is ever going to scale buildings and wreck havoc in the streets, but Raimi made me wholly believe that it is not impossible.  His attention to detail here is impeccable.  I love the way that Raimi captured what it felt like to read a Spider-Man comic book as a boy.  The film has this light and airy (colorful) feel to it, yet it is laced with that suspense that only comes from truly engrossing yourself in this character and his purpose.<br /><br />Bravo.<br /><br />And yet still, the most impressive facet of `Spider-Man 2' is the fact that it has a real heart.  It is less the story of a superhero and more the story of a complex and conflicted young man, trying desperately to juggle his life in a way that makes the most sense; paying his dues where they belong while still developing a life that will satisfy and complete him.<br /><br />We are all Peter Parker, minus the superpowers.<br /><br />I still firmly believe that Toby Maguire was BORN to play this part, and it is still the only role I've ever really believed him in.  He is not my favorite actor, but this is one of my favorite characters, and my heart is welled up in this man because of what Maguire does here.<br /><br />So, best superhero movie of all time?</p></body></html>

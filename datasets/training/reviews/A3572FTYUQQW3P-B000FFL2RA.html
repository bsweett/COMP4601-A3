<meta name="summary" content="Bloom does the Crusades"></head><body><p>I am a student of history and have read extensively in this period so I was looking forward to this film.  Unfortunately this is a terribly flawed film and this begins with Orlando Bloom who is terribly miscast. Dirt and grit does not make you either masculine or heroic.  Bloom is alleged to be a "blacksmith" but he is probably about 50 pounds too light to be convincing in that role.  We are expected to believe that in a matter of hours / days he becomes a skilled warrior capable of ending off some well armed and mounted men-at-arms.  Mastering the broadsword requires a great deal more practice.<br /><br />The villains in the film are based on actual characters and come across pretty much like I think they were.  The Muslims are portrayed in a rather sympathetic light which isn't too far from the historical record.  I thought the film was relatively slow, Bloom was miscast, but the photography was good as were the costumes.  I thought the storyline was a little too politically correct and the ending was simply not believable.  A little more action might have helped.  Overall a so-so film but one that could have been better.</p></body></html>

There are many memorable characters, from the smarmy boss to the mumbling paper shuffler to the beer-swilling neighbor of Peter, the main character.  This is a hilarious fantasy-come-true about three guys who stick it to the company by creating a virus which will funnel company money into an account in their names.  Jennifer Aniston plays Peter's girlfriend but her role is pretty minor compared to the more interesting characters described above.  When you're in the mood for a laugh, this movie would be a good choice.</p></body></html>

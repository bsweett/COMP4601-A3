The movie here focuses on the aftermath of the rage virus, pikcing up the pieces where 28 days left of. The movie starts 28 Weeks later when around 1000 odd english citizens are allowed to return back to London but they are confined to stay in a military guarded and protected block of the city called sector 1. The story develops as one of the infected from outside the sector is brought into the sector as the subject does not show sypmtoms of rage virus but it is later found that the subject is immune to the virus but is neverthless a carrier of the virus. Unlike the previous one by Danny Boyle which aimed at more of a cult clasic or film noir style and pretty much focused on 5 characters against an army of zombies, this one is more centered on the emass infection of people  and we also get to see the role of the army as a overseeing body which protects the people and also kills those very people without compassion following strict military orders when there is a chance that they have been infected. The zombies are portrayed with greater movement and agility and ferociousness than in 28 days.There is also more blood and gore. The direction is spot on keeping the tempo up and the tension pulsating. The Soundtrack follows the same grunge metal theme which acts as the coda for the diseased and hopeless london.The movie sustains interest because it paints this grand canvas of large scale infection seen and experienced through the eyes of a family. Robert Carlyle is the father of this family and it is about him and his two daughters and his wife and what happens to them along the way.  I won't give away more than that. The spanish director of this film is really good and this is his first movie in the English language. This guy is going to make a lot of good movies. He is that good. He's a made a sequel that stands up to the predecessor.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></body></html>

I liked the Vatican and the majesty of its architecture and its clergy. I would like to go there one day and tell my story. I love Italy. I loved Robert's quick mind, he is so intelligent and can put things together faster than a computer. It would be fun to put together clues and find the treasure or answer at the end or throughout. I recommend the Da Vinchi Code over this film yet it has a similiar thread just not as much of a find at the end, not as mysterious of a quest and not as rich with character development.</p></body></html>

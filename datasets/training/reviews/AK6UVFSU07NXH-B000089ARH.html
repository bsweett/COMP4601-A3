<meta name="summary" content="A movie to Crowe about."></head><body><p>Cameron Crowe wrote and directed &quot;Almost Famous&quot;, which is fitting since it is largely about his own beginnings. Cameron was the youngest writer for Rolling Stone magazine and, as a teenage journalist, he followed numerous bands as they went on tour. In this film, these bands are rolled up into a four-man group called Stillwater. These guys get my vote for the best band that never was. Since I was just out of kindergarten when the story was set, you should forgive me for thinking, after my first viewing, that Stillwater was an authentic recreation of some famous group from the early 70's. The realism is that perfect! <p>But this movie is not about a band, at least not predominantly. It is a  coming of age story. A young man raised in an unusual household, with an unusual mother, is taking his first steps to adulthood. The interesting thing is that his first steps are so large as to stretch past most people's entire careers. Through a combination of talent, luck and timing, young William Miller, played perfectly by Patrick Fugit, is recruited by Rolling Stone magazine to write an article on Stillwater. This strange occurrence actually makes sense when you watch the film despite sounding ridiculous as I write it. <p>If William goes through dramatic changes in a short time, his mother is a rock of stability. Elaine Miller is able to &quot;freak out&quot; most people, with a few choice words but to her son, she is home, safety, love and in a way... imprisonment. She is very intense but caring and it is this combination which drives her eighteen year old daughter to a life of airline stewardship. We can see Elaine's true courage however, when she agrees to let the fifteen year old William go &quot;on the road&quot; with a drug taking,  womanizing rock band. This, after we have seen her characterize Simon and Garfuncle as &quot;stoned&quot; and forbidden their music from her house. <p>One of the most important people William comes into contact with, on his journey, is Penny Lane. She is a beautiful, glowing, perfectly permed young dryad who follows the bands and has a following of her own. Adamant that she is not a groupie, Penny has created a concept called &quot;Band Aids.&quot; Her subscribers refrain from sex with the performers in an effort to more truly embrace the pure experience. She talks a good game but in the end, she's just a young woman in love. The object of her affection is Russell Hammond, the lead guitarist and Zen-master for Stillwater. Her situation is complicated after William falls in love with her, at first sight. <p>Thus Alice enters Wonderland and many an adventure is had. Despite William's best intentions and the good advice of his mentor, Lester Bangs, the band manages to seduce him. His plan, to get in and out before missing a test, is soon discarded in the face of a larger than life rock and roll experience. There is one truly touching scene where the band, (and company), is riding their bus to the next gig and singing along to &quot;Tiny Dancer.&quot; William leans over to Penny and says, &quot;I have to go home!&quot; To which she replies, with a magical pass of her hand, &quot;You are home.&quot; That says it all. <p>There are several contrasting character changes happening during the film.  One stands out more than most. William starts his professional career as a fan, loving the band, the music and the whole lifestyle. As the tour progresses and his eyes are opened, he becomes, not jaded but more worldly, professional and wise. Conversely, Penny Lane is introduced to us as the epitome of sophistication. She is young but knowing, and handles William as an older sister might. As the film progresses we discover that Penny is not so all knowing as she seemed. She is just as fragile and naively hopeful as any other girl her age. In the end, it is William that has to send her a reality check. <p>Everything about this film is fascinating. The music is just wonderful, with Billy Crudup and Jason Lee bringing authenticity to every performance. The band's interpersonal dynamic is almost a character of its own. This climaxes during the famous plane crash scare, when each confesses their deepest secrets to the unrestrained laughter of the audience. William, his Mother and Penny are all unforgettable creations. Crowe is a wonderful writer, so good in fact, that I am disappointed he didn't turn this story into a book. Watching the movie will just have to be enough, for now.</p></body></html>

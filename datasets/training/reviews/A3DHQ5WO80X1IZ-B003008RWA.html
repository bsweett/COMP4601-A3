Like most of his movies, I think he's too one-sided, thus negating his overall argument. But this isn't as biased as Fahrenheit 911, where his 10% over-the-top allowed critics to attack the whole movie. You just know that things aren't quite as bad in US health system as he makes out, and not as perfect in the other countries as he makes out. (I'm sure you can find people in Canada, England, France and Cuba that have their own horror stories as well.) That being said, it's still a powerful and persuasive movie that genuinely asks the question - "Is this really the best we can do?"</p></body></html>

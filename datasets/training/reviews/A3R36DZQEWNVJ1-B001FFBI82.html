<meta name="summary" content="JarHead gets an OO-RAH!"></head><body><p>Jaky Gyllenhaal (Brokeback Mountain, Highway) stars as Anthony Swoffard who is in the deserts of Saudi Arabia where he is being trained by Sgt. Sykes played by Jamie Foxx (Ray, Collateral), to get ready for the on coming war. Swofford becomes a sniper and his spotter is Troy, played by Peter Sarsgaard (Skeleton Key, Shattered Glass). Darkly funny and some scenes with power make JarHead interesting and the direction is amazing, be it explosions or soldiers walking along burnt cars or oil fields at night on fire with is scary and beautiful at the same time. Also starring Chris Cooper (Capote, October Sky), Jacob Vargas (Nexy Friday, Traffic), Lucas Black (Crazy In Alabama, Sling Blade) and Dennis Haysbert (Tv's 24, Absolute Power) They got refrences from The Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now and Giant with James Dean. Gyllenhaal gives one of his best performances so far, Sarsgaard is explosive and Jamie Foxx digs out of the BOMB pit that was the movie Stealth. "Welcome to the Suck!"</p></body></html>

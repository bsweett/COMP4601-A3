I mean sure, Transporter 2 isnt an epic three hour movie, no Oscar winning acting and dialouge, and no big stars. So whats the appeal to this? Its just a fun, action packed movie. The movie packs mostly everything you can think of within 90 minutes. The action is awesome, and Jason Statham does an amazing job as Frank. They set up a part three, and I'm excited to see what happens. Highly recommend this movie if you like a good action flick, you wont be disappointed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not quite the movie..."></head><body><p>...I expected, and not anywhere near being the classic "The Sixth Sence" is -but all in all an indeed entertaining and watchable supernatural thriller. A bit fast-forward story, at least I experienced "The Skeleton Key" this way, and you can very soon tell where it's going -but the ending might surprise you anyway, just don't expect it to be too clever nor interesting.<br /><br />The acting is good, John Hurt perhaps in a bit wasted role -but hey, someone had to play it, and he does well with what he has to work with.<br /><br />I expected more from the surround, you might as well watch in in stereo. Picture-quality as with todays' standard.<br /><br />"The Skeleton Key" as a horror-movie being it was written by the man behind "The Ring";<br /><br />This is not a very scary movie, in fact I didn't jump in my seat once. A few minor tense minutes there at the end of it, but nothing remembarable. Not a must-see, but no waste of time either. An ok thriller, promising perhaps a little too much..?</p></body></html>

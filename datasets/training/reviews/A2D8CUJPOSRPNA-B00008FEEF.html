<meta name="summary" content="This film may have been necessary...but was the gore?!"></head><body><p>HALLOWEEN 2 is a unique film in many ways, because it picks up the chain of events of the original HALLOWEEN basically right at the end of that film and continues them.  Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance are back, with the masked figure known as Michael Myers still stalking the streets of Haddonfield.  This time, much of the murderous mayhem is centered around the local clinic where Curtis has been hospitalized...and here it is revealed exactly why the madman is targeting her.<p>Because Michael Myers couldn't even be stopped by Pleasance's gun at the end of HALLOWEEN 1, this sequel may actually have been necessary.  And certainly for the most part, director Rick Rosenthal, helped by ace cinematographer Dean Cundey (who later shot JURASSIC PARK and APOLLO 13), keeps his focus on suspense, in the tradition of the original.<p>But something sure went wrong when it was finished.  Reportedly, feeling that this suspenseful emphasis might make HALLOWEEN 2 look old-fashioned in light of such HALLOWEEN-inspired imitators such as FRIDAY THE 13TH, Carpenter (who was only co-producer/co-writer this time, along with Debra Hill) went back in (without Rosenthal's knowledge) and shot some graphically gory murder inserts.  This is really a shame!  The sequel may have been necessary, but the explicit violence and gore weren't!<p>This makes HALLOWEEN 2, for me, a curiously disappointing film.  Had Carpenter not tinkered with Rosenthal's methods by trying to liven up things with a bunch of unnecessarily gory murders, this could have equalled the original.  Instead, it's not much better than HALLOWEEN's many imitators.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not as good as 24"></head><body><p>The Sentinel brings to the screen the story of a Secret Service agent who is framed for allegedly plotting to kill the President.<br /><br />Michael Douglas and Kiefer Sutherland (!!!) carry out their performances well, though Eva Longoria, who is otherwise wonderful in Desperate Housewives, not to mention gorgeous, does not really "belong" in this movie.<br /><br />The acting and the music are pretty good, while the plot and the dialogues by being unoriginal and rather uninteresting are average and sometimes below average (been there done that...).<br /><br />In a nutshell, The Sentinel is like a mediocre episode of 24, therefore, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment.  3.5 Stars</p></body></html>

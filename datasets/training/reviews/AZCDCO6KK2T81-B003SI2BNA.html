The supporting cast is perfect and believable.  The direction is clever and well-paced, but not heavy-handed for this genre.  The scriptwriters created terrific characters and believable plot twists in this very suspenseful and eerie film.<br /><br />This is another well-adapted and even improved version of the original Japanese horror flick, but it isn't in the same vein as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006SGYL0">The Grudge</a> although it is influenced by it.  It is much more subdued and darker than that film and is more character driven.  Some may not like this slower, more deliberately paced chiller, but that is what gives it momentum and suspense.  I think it's very well-paced for the genre it falls into which is the traditional haunted house kind of film.<br /><br />This film is worth owning, but not having seen the film in the theaters, I have no clue what was added to this "unrated" edition of the original PG-13 theatrical release.  I can say that I found nothing objectionable in it as sometimes happens with these "unrated" releases.  Less shocking and intense than other Asian horror imports or influenced films, but that made this a fun popcorn film for me and my family as there is no bloodshed, violence, sex, or nudity in this film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of my favorite movies in my collection"></head><body><p>Dogma to me is one of my favorites in my movie collection.  I am Catholic but this movie made me laugh so hard in so many scenes, I was not even offended by any of the movie.  Also if anyone ask me I tell them the truth like the front of the dvd cover "Faith is a funny thing."  That is actually true in so many ways,  I am forever a Kevin Smith fan after this movie.  So like I say typically if you need a good laugh and unwind from hard days work and unwind from life then pick this dvd up and laugh your butt off scene after scene.</p></body></html>

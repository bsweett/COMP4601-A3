<meta name="summary" content="The Director's Edition"></head><body><p>Similar to what the recent remastering of the original series has done, this is updated as well, but in a lesser degree. A lot of care was put into touching up and completing Robert Wise's original vision for the film. Using modern technology, new scenes that were in the original storyboard art but never used are finally brought to life. It's not so much new scenes, but the original vision for already existing scenes that could be done when the film was originally made. There aren't big changes, but small ones that you probably wouldn't really notice unless you were very familiar with the original film. That's how natural the updated film feels and stays a loyal as possible to the original movie.<br /><br />Some scenes that have been added are just beautiful. One scene in particular is the first time you see Spock on Vulcan. They have finally been able to make a realistic looking Vulcan planet and give it atmosphere. Unlike in the original film when he is blinded by the sunlight, but the sky is black and no sun to be seen. Overall, this updated "Director's Edition" just makes the film more enjoyable to watch and even more "sci-fi" than it previously was.<br /><br />It will not convert you if you don't like the original film, because it is very much the same and it is just as interesting. So, if you thought this film was boring, you still will. But, if you like this movie, it just enhances the experience.</p></body></html>

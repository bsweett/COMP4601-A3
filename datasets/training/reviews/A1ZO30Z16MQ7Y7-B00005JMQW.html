<meta name="summary" content="HE DID NOT LIKE IT! KILL HIM!!!!!!!!"></head><body><p>Before everyone goes all crazy on me because I did not like this movie, just know that I really tried and wanted to like it. Okay now, on to the review. I'm a big fan of the 50's cartoons( I so want that new box set!). It had a very good taste to it. As the years went by and the cartoon series got older( around the end of the 80's), it began to lose it's touch. I was hoping Sony would make this movie more like the 50's cartoons instead of the first one but it looks like they went there own way. What's the problem? Tobey Maguire can't act, the villain is laughable(wach the ending), you don't care about Maguire and Dunst relationship, not enough Spidey action, and you spend half the film laughing at Tobey Maguire facial exspressions(wach the train seane!!!!). Dunst is the ONLY good person at acting, well, the guy who played the villain was good to, but besids that, no one can act. I was hoping we would get a better film from the guy who made Evil Dead and Darkman. oh well, I guess every one has there flops. Now before you start complaying that I'm wrong this film is good, or that guy is full of it, please first know that I tried hard to like this movie, I really did. Okay, you can wine now!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good horror movie in drag"></head><body><p>People first seeing "Predator" may confuse it with a action movie, due to its star and the fact that it has a couple of action sequences in it (e.g., the attack on the terrorist base camp midway through the film).  However, when compared against any number of teenage slasher movies, this film follows the horror formula nearly to a T: a group of people go to X place, cut off from civilization.  One by one a dark, malignant force picks them off until the climactic duel between good and evil at the end.<br /><br />If you enjoy Ahhnold movies, then you won't be disappointed, but if you also enjoy classic teenage horror movies, you won't be disappointed either.  One thing's for sure: Camp Crystal Lake never had this much firepower.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not everyone will be pleased to drink from this "Fountain" but it will be a tasty drink  for some"></head><body><p>An epic film (at a non-epic length of 96 minutes), Darren Aronofsky's ambitious science fiction parable "The Fountain" demonstrates that the director wants to continue to make dense, emotionally complex films that require audience involvement. Although it isn't flawless, "The Fountain" is an enjoyable film that moves along at its own leisurely pace. Although "The Fountain" was critically attacked when it was released (it was booed at Cannes), it's an ambitious worthwhile film for those who have the patience and aren't expecting a explosion filled Summer blockbuster kind of movie. Aronosfky serves a different slice of "pi" here in trying to tackle the subject of mortality, reincarnation and the afterlife. It's a fascinating film even when it fails to reach beyond the rudimentary topic at hand.<br /><br />The different strands of this interlaced triptych have different success rates with the story involving the Conquistador's search for the Tree of Life that a Franciscan Monk (Mark Margolis) friendly to the Spanish throne may be able to find. If the Conquistador (Hugh Jackman) can find it, Queen Isabella (Rachel Weisz)may survive the expanding inquisition. The present day story with Jackman as Dr. Tom Creo struggling to find the cure to his wife's cancer (she's writing a book called The Fountain which details the first part of the story about the Conquistador and his search. When Tom "reads" the story he's reading a metaphor about what is happening to his wife, his efforts to save her, etc.) all the while running into unintentional roadblocks from his boss (Ellen Burstyn in an Oscar nominated performance) is along with the first, most successfully. The last segment set in the 26th Century while visually dazzling is the most cryptic much as Kubrick's ending for "2001: A Space Odyssey" was cryptic in tackling the concept of mortality and "rebirth". Again, it could be seen as Tom's efforts to save his wife from his perspective and his ultimate surrender to fate and the acceptance that he may not be able to save her in this life but can join her in the next.<br /><br />While Arononfsky's ambitious story may leap out of his grasp, there's much to admire in this visually stunning film. It won't be for everyone but like Kubrick's "2001" it will speak to a specific audience and the skill with which it is made will insure that its reputation (both for good and bad) will grow with time. In fact Aronofsky's film probably has more in common with the two versions of "Solaris" more than Kubrick's film with their consideration of life, death and how they impact those we love.<br /><br />Linking all six characters that Jackman and Weisz play is an interesting idea that might confuse those expecting the film to be literal. On the other hand, one could rationalize why they are in all three stories since it touches the attempt by Jackman's character in all three stories to try and defeat death allowing him to stay with the women he loves. Perhaps in some way they are the same "characters" constantly struggling to defeat death to stay together. You decide. Aronofsky takes an almost literary approach to the material eschewing the action-adventure approach of most film science fiction.<br /><br />For those interested in the DVD extras we get a six part featurette that can be viewed all at once that covers everything from the genesis of the project (when it was entitled "The Last Man") and the discussions that Aronofsky had with a Ari Handel (who co-wrote the story). They had many discussions about life, death and fate all of which were fed into this compelling film. It's amazing what Aronofsky gets away with given the low budget of the film. At one point the film went into turnaround when Brad Pitt and Cate Blachett pulled out of the film. Originally budgeted at $75 million, the production saw its budget sliced in half after Pitt left the production (reportedly due to creative differences with Aronofsky). Aronofsky lost his sets (they were auctioned off when Village Roadshows pulled out of the production as well)<br /><br />The fascinating, beautiful visual effects were achieved using micro-photography of chemical reactions on Petri dishes vs. with CGI and looks just as good (if not better) than some of the visual effects for similar films that have used CGI to portray a star about to go nova. We also get the original theatrical trailer. While that's nice, a good commentary track would have been a bit more revealing particularly during some of the more symbolic and over-the-top sequences of the film.<br /><br />Is "The Fountain" for everyone? No. Some will consider the film to be a pretentious hodge-podge of romantic/spiritual sci-fi and homage to Trakovsky's "Solaris".  "The Fountain" has more in common with Tarkvosky's "Solaris" than "2001" (although Tarkovsky's film is about a man trying to deaden himself against the living memory of the woman he loved). In that regard, "The Fountain" is a fine companion piece to both films (if a bit more esoteric and cryptic). I personally like "The Fountain" but it will take some patience to stay with the overlapping often intersecting storylines and absorb the ending of the film. "The Fountain" is thoughtful, emotional science fiction something of a rarity in today's bigger, louder, faster science fiction films. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009ATIX">Solaris</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006L92F">Solaris - Criterion Collection</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005ASUM">2001 - A Space Odyssey</a></p></body></html>

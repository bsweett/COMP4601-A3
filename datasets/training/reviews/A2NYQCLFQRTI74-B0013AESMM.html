When she comes back to, she gradually sets out to get revenge on her fiance's killers.<br /><br />It's about time a female character in a movie is shown taking revenge and justice in her hands. Sorry for all the people out there that did not enjoy the movie because they didn't think Foster's character was realistic. But if these things were to happen to you, I'm quite certain, you, like Foster's character, would take the law in your hands and chase after the bad guys. So this is a great film for that.<br />I also enjoyed Foster's performances, though at times some scenes stretched out.</p></body></html>

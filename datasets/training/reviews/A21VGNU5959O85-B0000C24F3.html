Die hard alien enthusiast impaled themselves on Giger-esque protrusions the second this movie came out. I remember, before I had even seen the film hearing the critics take a big "queen" sized egg laying crap on it. I saw it, and although it isn't my favorite out of the three (number 2 is) I still loved it. I have to admit I was disappointed that Newt, Bishop and Hicks didn't make it seeing as how the entire plot of Aliens revolved around rescuing Newt in the end, how many people died trying to rescue her? Anyway, the complaints I have seen usually say that they shouldn't have killed Ripley, even though Sigourney Weaver helped produce this film and it was her idea to do it, I think it was entirely appropriate to kill her off and I will tell you why. The poor woman, if you think about it, from the first alien, to aliens to alien 3 has maybe spent a handful of days awake, its been years and years and years but to her its as if for two weeks she has seen nothing but friends and loved ones die, and fought these bugs with her whole being. Knowing, a queen was inside her, was the last straw. Impregnated by the one adversary who has ripped your life away from you must have been both horrifying and in a way a relief from all the pain. In the end she embraces her death, as well as her death bringer thinking she is ending the chain of tragedy. Just like when she brings Bishop back and he says that he would rather her just disconnect him than exist as a half being (or in his case a quarter) she would rather choose her fate than have the Alien choose it for her. The cast in this movie is amazing; I am especially enamored with Charles Dance who played Dr. Clemons. The first movie I ever saw him in was The Golden Child and he played "Sardo Numspa" Charles Dutton, Pete Postlethwaite, and many unknowns at the time make a kind of "Alcatraz monastery" in space, and they all give the bleakness and desperation and fear a face. No matter what you think, you cannot argue that there are good performances, the setting was awesome and that any Alien is a good Alien. My only complaint is the, of course, CGI effects in dealing with the Alien in action, it just hasn't aged well at all and they should update that.</p></body></html>

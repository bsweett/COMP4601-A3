The characters are so hilarious and there are so many of them that you find yourself laughing virtually non stop. Myers is so funny to watch and so original and ahead of the game in all he does. So many catchphrases have come from this movie it just shows how funny and in tune with viewers it is. Buy it, watch it and laugh so hard you'll cry!<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

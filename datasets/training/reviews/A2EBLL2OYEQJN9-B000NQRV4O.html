<meta name="summary" content="Love quadrangles and double and triple crosses"></head><body><p>This is a complex tale about love double-crosses between two couples.  There isn't a heck of a lot of development of the relationships, and people do have sex willy-nilly, but it is fascinating to watch the power struggle between members of each twosome.  Those who have the power early in the film lose it by the climax, and emotional havoc is brought on again and again.  The film portrays how easy it is for a person to be attracted to more than one other person, each for different reasons.<br /><br />The film can be a little difficult to watch, as great lengths of time pass between scenes with no warning.  Everything comes together by the end.  Natalie Portman's performance (also her stripping scene) are absolutely not to be missed.</p></body></html>

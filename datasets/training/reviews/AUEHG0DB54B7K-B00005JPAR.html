There is a definite feel of  Stanley Kubrick in The Fountain from the visual effects, particularly the scene set as Hugh Jackman travels in space.  The story is set over 1000 years covering a16th century Conquistador Tomas who is searching for a way to save the Queen of Spain, a doctor, named Tommy, trying to cure his wife Isabel (Izzy) of cancer and Tom, a 26th century space traveler heading toward a nebula that will explode to give birth to a planetary system and new life.<br /><br />The three stories cut into each other, a task that must have been difficult in a film with such an abstract story, and there is interaction between the stories.  Izzy writes a chronicle of her 16th century life and Tomas' quest for the Tree of Life but does not finish her manuscript; that is left for Tommy to do.  Tommy, ironically, in searching for a cure for Izzy's cancer tries an experimental drug on a monkey named Donavan, whose fatal brain tumor not only shrinks but grants immortality.  However, this was not the cure that Tommy wants, at first; Izzy is dead before Tommy realizes that he could have saved her.  In the 26th century, Tom is traveling with a slowly dying Tree of Life to Xilbalba, the Mayan underworld where in destruction life is reborn.  Viewers who demand that a story to be told chronologically will probably be disappointed at the way the film cuts back and forth between stories.  The Fountain is a spiritual journey into immortality; our search for a cure for all our physical maladies until we conquer death itself.  I found myself drawn into the ideas of the film as it progressed; it is a film that provokes thinking and discussion<br /><br />This film truly belongs to writer-director Darren Aronofsky  who spent seven years making the movie, a road with a lot of bumps along the way.  Hugh Jackman turns in a magnificent performance displaying a full range of emotion from joy, sorrow and ecstasy.  I found myself accepting him completely as the people he was playing.  This has been a good year for him with his excellent performances in The Prestige and The Fountain.  If one enjoys being challenged by imaginative filmmakers, then ignore the inane comments made about "Donavan's Brain" and see The Fountain.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Lost Potential"></head><body><p>Keep in mind while reading this, I've never seen the original "The Fog" by John Carpenter.  So I'm reviewing it from that perspective.<br /><br />There was a lot of potential I could see in this movie.  However, very little of it was delivered.  The characters were very thinly developed and the story was just plain silly and bad.  The acting by most of the people was very unconvincing.  But what do you expect from a horror flick?  In the end it really wasn't scary at all and opportunities they had to make it truly scary they passed over.  Maybe this was to prevent it from getting an R rating, which finacially is probably a better move in this day and age.<br /><br />But I will give it thumbs up on the special effects.  There was some pretty amazing stuff that I'm sure the original could not even come close to copying.<br /><br />Unless you are a horror or special effect nut, I wouldn't bother with this movie.  Otherwise, go at it but don't expect much.</p></body></html>

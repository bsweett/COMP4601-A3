While director Ang Lee has a certain undeniable flair, the movie itself is not what one would expect, in terms of action.  Credible CGI effects are brilliant, and Eric Bana and Jennifer Connolly do a commendable job in filling out underdeveloped roles.  I must also admit that as I did in the t.v. version of the HULK, I wondered why Banner busts out of all of his clothes, but always seems to have his pants intact.  Seeing this behemoth bounce, jump and create pandemonium of course is the high point of the movie, but trying to legitimize the storyline as pathos only hinders the pacing.  Nick Nolte is effective as Banner's demented Dad and Sam Elliott is his usual cowboy self as Connolly's general father.  Josh Lucas in an uncharacteristically villainous role doesn't have enough screen time or motivation to flesh out his character.  While I found myself entertained for most of the movie, its nebulous ending and psychobabble finish weren't really what I wanted.  HULK pales terribly to the far superior X MEN and SPIDERMAN movies, but it's not the horrible disaster many critics claim.</p></body></html>

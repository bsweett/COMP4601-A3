Haute Tension is not, by any stretch of the imagination, one of them.<br /><br />Haute Tension starts off relatively well, if mediocre; two friends, Marie (Around the World in 80 Days' Cecile de France) and Alex (The Fifth Element's Maiwenn Le Besco) are headed out to Alex's family's country place for a weekend of intensive studying. Of course, if you're headed to a secluded area in a movie, chances are there's going to be a serial killer lying around waiting to menace you. True to form, we have one (Irreversible's Philippe Nahon).<br /><br />The short review is: if you've read Dean Koontz' novel Intensity, or seen the TV miniseries based upon it, you can safely overlook this film's existence. (It's such an obvious copy that some wag added Koontz as one of the film's writers on IMDB.) Aja and scriptwriter Gregory Levasseur (who also collaborated on this year's subpar remake of The Hills Have Eyes) throw in a twist at the end to stop the movie from outright getting sued, conveniently forgetting that said twist invalidates most of the movie previous unless those watching it do some pretty creative thinking to come up with paper-thin rationalizations for earlier scenes.<br /><br />I've been largely disappointed with the recent rash of remake horror films, but Haute Tension was worse than any of them. **</p></body></html>

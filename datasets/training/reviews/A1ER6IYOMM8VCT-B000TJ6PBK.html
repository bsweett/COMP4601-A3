MY 1000 TH REVIEW! :-D"></head><body><p>I watched '1408' with my usual low expectations, but I was amazed to find that someone understood what a horror film is supposed to be! Films like this don't come around often, but when they do, you remember how it feels to have chills run down your spine! While not perfect, '1408' delivers in spades what most "horror" films these days lack to their very core. Cusack makes you believe what your experiencing and while the director's cut ending is better, I found the theatrical ending quite chilling too, Both versions are available on the two disc collector's edition which is the edition I recommend. The DVD transfer is excellent and there are some interesting extras included. Imagine,... a horror movie that's actually scary.....what a concept! I think I'll be watching some cartoons before I go to sleep tonight! :-I</p></body></html>

The reason I say final is not because the movie is bad, but because it's so entertaining and works so hard to tie up all loose ends that a fourth movie would have little chance of topping it. This time around, Austin must stop Dr. Evil from melting the polar ice caps with a device known as "Preparation H." Along the way, he must travel through time, reconnect with an old girlfriend, reconcile with his father, and battle the insane Goldmember. <p>Part of what makes "Goldmember" work is that there is some semblance of a plot this time around. While the plot is still just an excuse to string together gags, it manages to reference events from the other movies, the Austin Powers mythos, and even toss is a few twists in the ending. Yes, the emotional revelations are played for laughs, but they resonate just enough to give a sense of purpose to the adventure, something that was missing from "The Spy Who Shagged Me." The acting is top notch. Mike Myer's ability to play four distinct characters is impressive, and Goldmember is highly memorable. Beyonce Knowles gives energy and personality to Foxxy Cleopatra, and Seth Green and Verne Troyer continue to develop their characters. Michael Caine, in his limited screentime, is hilarious as Austin's father. <p>Of course, the series depends on its gags, and while not everything is funny, enough of it is that the ... bits don't matter. Thankfully, the screentime of a certain obese character has been toned down, along with most of the jokes involving body fluids. What we have left are clever perspective tricks, musical numbers, shadow play, a funny subtitles joke, parodies within parodies, and lots of celebrity cameos. All in all, while "Goldmember" doesn't have the originality of the first film, it comes in a very close second.<p>While the audio and video for the disc are both top-notch, I have to say the supplements disappointed me. New Line's infinifilm concept does nothing for me - it's a glorified version of the "follow the white rabbit", "007 logo", and countless other extended branching play options on other DVDs. What's worse is that it forces the extras to broken down into several little tidbits that aren't as long as they should be. Goldmember definitely had enough extras for a 2-disc treatment, and use of Infinifilm meant stuff was left out (including the Liz Hurley/Heather Graham deleted scenes). Other than that, this DVD is still highly entertaining and worth picking up for Austin Powers fans.</p></body></html>

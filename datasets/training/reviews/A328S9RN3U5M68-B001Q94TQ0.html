<meta name="summary" content="Realism and Character Driven Movie Results in Success"></head><body><p>MARIA FULL OF GRACE  is an unpretentious, low budget, superb little film that has managed to captivate the hearts of audiences everywhere. Writer/Director Joshua Marston has opted for extracting a slice of life in Colombia, found characters who symbolize the passions of young people who seek a  better life, and shows us how indomitable the human spirit can be.<br /><br />Maria (portrayed by a gifted and beautiful young Catalina Sandino Moreno) lives among the poor in Colombia, earning a living for her mother and sister by stripping thorns off roses in a factory.  Unhappy with her work conditions and with her useless boyfriend who has impregnated her, she has the courage to quit her job and at the encouragement of a passing acquaintance  agrees to serve as a 'mule' to transport drugs form Colombia to the United States.<br /><br />The film documents the means of transporting (swallowing many bags of drugs in a harrowing manner, riding an airplane with the fears associated with her  mission, arriving in America with all the terror of being in a strange place with a dangerous mission) in a way that feels so real that we as audience identify wholly with Maria.<br /><br />The story is new, the acting is superb, and the many underlying messages are profound.  This is a film for every audience. An excellent film in Spanish with English subtitles.<br /><br />Grady Harp</p></body></html>

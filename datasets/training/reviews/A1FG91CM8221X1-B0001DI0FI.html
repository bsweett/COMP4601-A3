<meta name="summary" content="A riveting journey on a tall ship."></head><body><p>Having never read Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin novels, I can't address how faithful Peter Weir's "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" is to the source material. (I have gleaned that the fans of O'Brian's novels probably wouldn't be satisfied with ANY film version.) I can definitely say, however, that Weir rivets our attention from the very first seconds of this movie, taking us into the far corners of the tall ship in the early morning fog, and never lets go of it until the final credits. Aided immeasurably by the magnficent camera work of Russell Boyd, Weir takes us into realms of thought, feeling and experience where the cinema seldom goes. He gives us a vivid picture of life aboard a British man-of-war during the Napoleonic wars, and draws us so deeply into the teamwork and camaraderie of the crew that we feel as if we're climbing the riggings ourselves. In a way, the actors are just as much a crew as the sailors they portray; none of them stands out, but all of them put their shoulders together and work as a perfect team, each man (there are, of course, no women on board) holding up his end to perfection. Even the starring performance of Russell Crowe as Jack Aubrey, courageous and consummately skilled ship's captain, is a masterpiece of understated team playing; different in degree but not in kind from his mates, he commands the movie but never overwhelms or bullies it. Likewise, Paul Bettany--standing a little apart from the rest of the crew as ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin--is a marvel of quiet, unobtrusive authority. There are some great debates between Aubrey, man of action, and Maturin, man of intellect, on the conduct of war and the nature of command; yet in the end they work together as a team, their essential harmony symbolized by their duets on the violin and cello. (Of the other actors in the film, special mention must be made of 13-year-old Max Pirkis as midshipman Lord Blakeney, who--after suffering a series of extreme traumas--lives up to his promise as a budding commander of men.) "Master and Commander" is such a consistently compelling action film that it catches you by surprise with its frequent moments of tragic emotion (hint: don't get too attached to any of the characters). But at the end you will leave the theater shouting a few huzzahs for Captain Aubrey and his men.</p></body></html>

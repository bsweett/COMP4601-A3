<meta name="summary" content="CSI: Saudi Arabia"></head><body><p>The Kingdom is definitely a great movie. An involved, modern day, sophisticated story; emotionally charged; suspenseful; fast paced and action packed; believable, great acting by great actors....What more can you ask for from a movie in an industry that seems to have forgotten how to deliver a great film?<br /><br />Fans of the series <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UX6TIO">CSI: Las Vegas</a> will love The Kingdom. A team of FBI agents led by Jamie Foxx is sent to Saudi Arabia to help with the investigation into an attack on a major US oil company's housing compound. The attack kills hundreds of civilian men, women and children, along with FBI agents which makes it personal for Foxx's team.<br /><br />Foxx and crew struggle with cultural barriers and political red tape to get their job done...and the clock is ticking. They are given 5 days in the country to solve the crime before they will be sent home.<br /><br />While the acting is believable, once the immediate impact of the movie wears off, you realize that some of the scenes and storyline are a real stretch. There are some death defying car crashes, shootouts that you only survive in a video game and quick ends to those that are in charge of the trouble. Regardless and most importantly, The Kingdom keeps viewers on the edge of their seats and thoroughly entertains from start to finish. Worthy of your view.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Day the Movies Died"></head><body><p>I kept waiting for the Earth to stand still for day, like in the original when the alien immobilizes all the technology for a day, and it never happened!  So, there really wasn't a "day" when everything stands still in this movie, but to me that's the least of it's problems.<br /><br />Warning, spoilers ahead!<br /><br />In this remake (more like a re-imagining) of the venerable 50's sci-fi classic, an alien character so wooden that he made me long for an Al Gore lecture arrives on Earth to tell the United Nations that we are all going to be irradicated so that the planet can be saved.<br /><br />Why tell us at all then?  Did this organization of alien civilizations just want us to know why we are all going to die before they kill us? No chance to change here; you threaten the planet and you're dead!  It's obvious to me that these alien civilizations had already advanced thousands of years beyond us technology while preserving their own planets, so why not just give us a few clues and help us out a bit?<br /><br />Nope, these aliens -- who have already arrived in their technology advanced eco-utopias -- just look at humanity as an object of contempt and decide they want us elimnated before another planet killing day goes by.  They are supposedly our moral superiors, yet they would commit genocide without any qualms whatsoever.<br /><br />Thankfully, the sleepwalking "Al Gore from space" sees the love of a mother for a child and decides to give us an alternative to annihilation (one I suppose he never would have thought of after observing humanity for seventy years).  He decides we have to change our lifestyle.  Never heard that one before!<br /><br />Rather than being turned to dust, we get to lose all our electricity and machines.  We get to go back to those wonderful times before the industrial revolution where the average life span was somewhere in the forties and half of all our children died as we were trying to raise them, and most of us worked from sun up 'till sundown on the farm.  But at least the planet was safe!<br /><br />This movie at least gives us a future with no more movies, and if all they're going to be are propaganda pieces that take their names from the classics, it can't be all that bad.<br /><br />Buy why stop here?  How about a reimagined Forbidden Planet where the Krell all died from global warming?  How about a remiagined Metropolis where it's not humanity that's being exploited; it's the planet!  How about a movie where a group of super rich Hollywood elites make a movie that does nothing more but to fill us with hopelessness and self-loathing and presents the only solution as the roll back of civilization to the dark ages?  This must be how rich liberals assuage their guilt.<br /><br />So, two stars from me, but one is just for Jennifer Connelly, who reminds me of a time when all I wanted in life was to snag a really attractive and smart brunette.</p></body></html>

This is pretty much how this movie comes across.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey appears to capture him well, as a vain and ultimately a lonely young man who, in the end, faded away from relevance.  But this does not make for a good movie.  The movie seemed to be very selective in what it presented, and created no sympathy for the man or for those around him.  I was glad when it was over and I can not recommend it as worthwhile viewing.  There are much better movies out there based on the life of a musician, and with more interesting characters, such as De-Lovely or Ray, and this one just does not belong in that category.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Van Helsing (Full Screen Edition) (2004)-It was almost impossible to watch this stinker!"></head><body><p>As far as I am concerned the movie "Van Helsing" (2004) was  a terrible film that should have all fans of the old Universal horror films up in arms and storming the studio with torches.  This film, which is described in the Amazon product description as being made for gamers (because of terrible graphics) and eight year olds because of the weak plot, was a total dissapointment to me.<br /><br />Since so much has already been written, I won't waste the magnetic ink on this very poor film and just say to all fans of the old Universal horror movies, rise up and storm the studio!<br /><br />I am not a traditionalist and you can check my voting record to see how I voted on new vs old horror films.  This movie was an insult having no integrity and not taking itself or horror films "seriously".  Lots of computer graphics and motion capture went into making this giant movie which came off looking like a cartoon.<br /><br />By the way, the voting distribution was clearly bi-modal with a maximum of both five stars and a single star.  Clearly, some of us loved and hated this film. In such circumstances the mean (~3 stars) is somewhat meaningless.<br /><br />Although not granted any points for readers thinking my article was useful I am happy to see that 166 have voted this terrible film only a single star to date!  Also glad to see that 50% of all voters felt this film rated three stars or less!</p></body></html>

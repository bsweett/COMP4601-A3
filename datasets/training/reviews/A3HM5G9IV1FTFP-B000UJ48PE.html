<meta name="summary" content="Redundant"></head><body><p>I liked the first "Hostel" movie. It was gratuitous, to be sure, but it also had a political subtext to it, where the young men who go off to Europe in order to exploit the culture end up being the ones exploited.<br /><br />Although "Hostel part II" picks up right where the last one left off, any political subtext is gone from this film, and it really plays more like another sequel in the "Saw" franchise, where gory stunts take the place of real suspense. Even the characters seem to be borrowed from better films ... Heather Matarazzo basically plays a grown up version of the tragic outcast she played in the groundbreaking "Welcome to the Dollhouse" and Bijou Phillips plays the same cautionary party girl she played in Larry Clark's excellent "Bully". The whole thing just feels really redundant.</p></body></html>

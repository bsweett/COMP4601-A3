This is not because the movies are running out of ideas (the twists, although expected, still have some creative bite to them) or because they are lacking a certain gruesome appeal (the films have a faithful fan base that has made the movies a Halloween tradition).  Instead, it's because the makers of this third flick, by the last frame, appear to have painted themselves into a corner with a bucket of pig guts and brain juice.<br /><br />But, if there's one thing the Saw movies have to teach us (and they go out of their way to pretend that they have a lot of teaching to do), it's that appearances can be deceiving.  This lesson I believe.  The rest of Saw's lecturing, well, it's hard to listen to a sermon when the pastor is ripping your arm off.<br /><br />All of the usual suspects are back this time around, with Jigsaw (a pale-as-rainwater Tobin Bell) and his accomplice, Amanda (Shawnee Smith), providing us with yet another meticulously macabre experiment in death and personal redemption.  This time the primary subjects are Jeff (a man subsumed by grief for his son, Dylan, killed by a hit-and-run driver) and Lynn (an ER doctor who is addicted to pain killers and her own ennui).  Jeff is given the opportunity, in a series of tests, to watch those responsible for his son's demise (a witness, a judge, the driver himself) meet their maker.  Or, if he chooses the moral high ground, Jeff can save them.  Lynn, meanwhile, has a much easier task: keep the dying Jigsaw alive long enough to watch this last game play out.  If Jigsaw's heart stops beating, so does hers.<br /><br />How Jeff and Lynn are connected is anyone's guess (and your first one will probably be right), but, as per usual, the film still has a few bloody aces up its sleeve.  Shot in a line-up of primary colors (each scene has its own color schema) and grittily textured, it's the most visceral Saw, yet.  Thankfully it doesn't trade (too much) of its brains for blood; just as the second film capitalized on elements of the first, this third covers the bases in all of them and -- if you watch close enough -- does, in fact, set up a few questions to be answered in a fourth.<br /><br />Some might not be interested in questions like these, though.  Although the franchise hasn't really lost its edge, it does appear to be losing steam.  Each Saw is staged, in some way, as a morality play, with people trapped inside their own brand of sick salvation.  The first movie was both inventive and focused.  The second widened its aim and, as such, missed a few targets.  This third film, with its ever-more-intricate web of wicked wisdom, almost collapses under its own weight.  Here's hoping that the next Saw tries to cut out its Deeper Message with a chainsaw, instead of a finely-edged scalpel.</p></body></html>

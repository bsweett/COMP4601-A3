<meta name="summary" content="BRING ON THE SEQUEL!"></head><body><p>The Brothers Grimm brings to the screen the story of two brothers, two charlatans, as they try to earn a living by playing on the simple folks' fears and superstitions.<br />The setting is Napoleonic Europe and specifically French occupied Germany and the strong sense of history adds to the overall enjoyment of the film.<br />Matt Damon, Heath Ledger, Lena Heady (who is GORGEOUS and is a more pretty/womanly version of Keira Knightley), Monica Bellucci (no comment needed), and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well.<br />There are slight, and not so slight, hints of the French film Brotherhood of the Wolf, Van Helsing and Sleepy Hollow as well as Dungeons and Dragons (!).<br />The setting, the dialogues, the music, the battle sequences, and the costumes are all wonderful!<br />On the negative side, some of the silly dialogue could have been avoided.<br />Very well written and very well presented, it is a movie definitely worth watching, especially for those with a soft spot for History and Fantasy, and even though quite silly at times, it will surely put you in a good mood!</p></body></html>

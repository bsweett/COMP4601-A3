<meta name="summary" content="Two disc set of Citizen Kane"></head><body><p>Well, the second disc, I didn't really care for, the story behind the making of Citizen Kane, even though I've read about it before. The actual film itself, is one of the best films ever made. Welles and company were so innovated for the times, and even now with today's standards of film making, the cinematography, lighting and editing really shine through, but it's the structure of the film that is really interesting, the way the story is told, not in linear format, the many layers of the story and seeing Welles as Kane age before our eyes, really adds to the depth of the character and story as well.</p></body></html>

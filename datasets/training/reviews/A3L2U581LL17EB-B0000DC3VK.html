<meta name="summary" content="That 1989 adventure movie with Connery is a better choice."></head><body><p>During the summer of 2003, there were three movies in particular I was looking forward to: Terminator 3, Pirates of the Caribbean, and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (hereto referred as LXG). The latter two, in particular, as both would be released in the same week and, from what I gathered in their respective trailers, harkened to the summer blockbuster I enjoy the most, the "Spielbergian" adventure. <p>By that, I mean the grand escapism that was virtually created by Raiders of the Lost Ark, later to be surpassed only by its second sequel, The Last Crusade. As of right now, none of the Jones flicks have ever been matched in sheer exhilaration. I look upon the trilogy as the three greatest and most purely enjoyable action movies ever made. Pirates and LXG both seemed to be striving for the same sense of fun, and I watched the former film first, left bitterly disappointed (though it's not a bad movie and it's one I'll probably give another look), then decided for some down time before I'd see LXG, much of that having to do with the dreadful reviews it'd been receiving from even typically "lenient" critics (Berge Garabedian, AKA Joblo, gave it a 4/10).<p>Having just seen it, I found myself surprised by some aspects and not so surprised by others. It's got a totally unspectacular story, sort of a James Bond-style plot about a madman who wants to start a world war so he can reap the profits. Allan Quatermain (Sean Connery) is brought in to form an "extraordinary" team of unique individuals to stop the villain. Among the league include Tom Sawyer, the Invisible Man, Mina Harker, Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde, Captain Nemo, and Dorian Gray, the latter of whom being the only literary character I'm entirely unfamiliar with. <p>LXG grossed just a little under 70 million dollars, and while not entirely a paltry sum, it's a lot less than I was expecting, even if the movie was as bad as most critics made it out to be. The trailers and concept, after all, wisely appealed to two crowds, Indiana Jones-style adventure lovers and superhero/comic book fans. I'm thinking, perhaps, the Indy crowd was turned off by the teamwork and special powers while the superhero crowd probably preferred their heroes more modern, or less "literature-ish." <p>Whatever the reason, I'm sure LXG is still destined for a reasonably-sized fanbase in the years to come, whether or not it's actually deserving of it. When all is said and done, LXG is nothing more than a ludicrous movie that entertained me somewhat for the duration of its fairly short running time (which I'm a bit thankful for, after sitting through the bloated Pirates of the Caribbean). Though I realize the movie has its roots and origins in a comic book, there's a lot here that's difficult to swallow. Too much, in fact, but I'll give a few examples.<p>For one, when it's discovered who the traitor is (spoiler warning), and it turns out it's the guy who formed the League in the first place, his reasons behind his actions make no sense. He claims he created the group so that he could steal their powers, but with the "spy" he had working for him, he could just as easily have accomplished his task without forming the league. Captain Nemo's submarine varies in size the same way Godzilla did, and the sub even manages to squeeze into the Venice canal. Connery's Quatermain is in amazingly great shape for a man of his age, able to leap off a moving car with no repercussions (and lands on his two feet without a hitch, no less!). Mina Harker, a vampire, is able to walk around in broad daylight.<p>I realize these kinds of movies are made for pure, unpretentious fun, and LXG at least has the action and f/x to back it up. The film is packed to the brim with gun battles and all-out brawls, and despite way too much rapid cutting from director Stephen Norrington, the action scenes are pretty fun to watch, if never truly rousing in the same fashion all the action from the Indiana Jones trilogy was. I was also impressed by a lot of the visual effects, particularly the Mr. Hyde creation, which is as at least as convincing as the Hulk.<p>Unfortunately, the cast mostly failed to impress me, probably the movie's damning fault. While Sean Connery is every bit as charismatic as ever, everyone else is clearly under his shadow. Only Shane West as the cocky, but likeable Tom Sawyer and Jason Flemying as Jekyll hold their own. Peta Wilson's Mina Harker is uninteresting, Stuart Townsend is what Johnny Depp would be if he were a bland actor (though, to be fair, Depp is a vanilla plain performer when he's playing non-eccentric roles), and Tony Curran's only noteworthy for sounding exactly like Jason Statham.<p>I suppose, in the end, LXG is a reasonably fun, but singularly idiotic experience. With a better script, this could have been an adventure movie for the ages, not just a middling timewaster. As of now, I'm still hoping for the best from the soon-to-be fourth Indiana Jones film, which could bring the movie that brings that grand escapist Saturday Matinee style serial back into fashion.<br />** 1/2 out of *****</p></body></html>

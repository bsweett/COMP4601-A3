<meta name="summary" content="An enjoyable movie, but not what I expected"></head><body><p>In Good Company features Dennis Quaid, Topher Grace and Scarlett Johannsen as Dan, Carter and Dan's daughter Alex.  When Dan's company is sold to a conglomerate, Carter is sent in by headquarters to run the company and becomes his new boss.<br /><br />Carter is Dan's boss despite the fact he is just a kid at 26 and Dan is 51 and has just found out his wife is having another baby.  Carter is a workaholic whose work habits just cost him his marriage.  Carter soon clings to dad and views him like the father he never had.  Dan meanwhile struggles to maintain his dignity after being demoted and to pay for his upcoming baby and his daughter's college bills.<br /><br />I expected In Good Company to be a romantic comedy of some sort.  Scarlett Johannsen as Alex seduces Carter for no reason and their romance blossoms despite the fact we are given no reason for them to like each other.  The romance exists only to provide conflict between Dan and Carter.<br /><br />In Good Company is about Dan and Carter.  Alex is there just to pad the movie and to provide motivation for Dan and Carter to act upon.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie.  Dan's speech about corporations not caring for the little guy didn't really bother me because in the end, Dan gladly decides to work for whatever big corporation owns his company.<br /><br />This is a fun, quick movie that most people should enjoy, just don't expect any romance.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding Horror-Science Fiction Collection"></head><body><p>The Alien series got better than ever in this deluxe collection that remastered and extended the saga; I don't know if it was the enhacements, the benefit of seeing all four movies in close proximity to one another, or just being able to appreciate certain aspects more now than in the mid-80s thru mid-90s, but when I saw the movies from this collected edition they were, as a whole, significantly better this time around.  The only one to come off slightly Lesser than on previous views was, ironically, "Aliens" - often hailed as the best of the lot - although that had more to do with certain points that were easy to miss in among all the action but, on subsequent viewings, show up a couple of inconsistencies.  More on that later.<br /><br />  The original "Alien" was great the first time around, but is one of those movies that gets even better with the hindsight provided by the sequels.  One noticable upon the rewatch is that "Alien Vs. Predator" actually patched its prequel status in very well with the hints way back in 1979's original that the company that owned the salvage ship had been looking for something specific all along, and already knew what the Xenomorphs were.  Alien was revolutionary in the scale and realism of its effects, in its own way as groundbreaking as fellow 70s space smash "Star Wars", and revolutionary in blending the science fiction movie and the horror movie more perfectly than ever before.  The single alien creature immediately established itself as one of moviedom's most memorable monsters, and nothing about the deadly potency of that one creature has been diminished by follow-ups that featured swarms of the Xenomorphs.  All the previously excised bits that have been added back in fit extremely well and make the whole better.  The only potential quibble to be found is this: of all the remarkable traits displayed by the Alien, perhaps the most stunning was its phenomenal growth rate (I mean, how long did it take it to go from burstling stage to full-grown armored adult?).  And yet I can't remember any of the characters even really noticing the seeming impossibility of this, although a lot of time is spent covering such aspects as the Xenomoph's possession of acid for blood.  I'm not saying they should have taken that characteristic out, or necessarily even extended its time frame, but at least having some comments by the characters on the most extraordinary of the creature's lifecycle characteristics would have been a help.  Overall, it didn't do much to detract from the overall movie though.<br /><br />  "Aliens" amps the whole thing up.  After the original had a single alien take on a small salvage crew, this one has an entire space colony threatened by a veritable army of the creatures.  Ripley, having returned to Earth after 57 years in deep-sleep,attempts to settle into as normal a life as possible.  Some time later, the company officials who initially were very disbelieving about her claims of aliens and a crashed mothership out on that barren planet, comes to her.  A colony is located on that very world, and all contact has very abruptly broken off, and they want her, purely as a 'precaution', to accompany the team they're sending off to check it out.  "Aliens" smartly contrasted the overwhelming prescence of the Xenomorphs in the second half of the movie by an almost total lack of the creatures in the first hour or so, allowing everything time to build up nicely.  "Aliens" introduced some of the series's most memorable characters, including perrennial fan favorites Newt (the little girl survivor, played by Carrie Henn) and Bishop (Lance Henrikson).  The Cpl. Hicks character (action-sf stalwart Michael Biehn) also added a lot to the show.  Awesome special effects are a high point.  Biggest flaw: inconsistency.  Take the acidic blood of the Xenomorphs.  There are times when even a small amount can do hideous, lethal damage to a human, but at other times when the battles are raging and the heavy machine guns are firing all over the place, you've got multiple aliens exploding in close proximity to various characters and they don't seem to suffer significant damage.  You could counterargue that different 'castes' or whatever of Xenomorphs have different bloodtypes, but that seems a bit contrived; and that situation is symbolic of inconsistencies that crop up a couple of times to mildly hinder an otherwise excellent movie.<br /><br />  "Alien 3" is the most under-rated of the original quadrilogy, crashing a ship from the previous film on a remote prison planet where a bizarre socity complete with its own religion has sprung up.  It heads in the opposite direction of "Aliens", drastically reducing the Xenomorphs's numbers and leaving the human characters with only makeshift weapons (compared to the large high-tech arsenals of the space marines from "Aliens").  All the Alien movies are hybrids of various genres and styles, but if the first is the most 'science fiction'-al of them and the second fits neatest under the action movie banner, "Alien 3" is the most horror movie oriented of the collection.  Phenomenal effects, high-caliber acting and characterization and a whopper of a finale.<br /><br />  "Alien: Resurrection" is the most flawed of the lot but still a very good movie; I enjoyed it much more when I saw it again than when I first saw the VHS a couple weeks afer its release. Fewer people have seen Alien 3 than the first two and therefore might not know the ending, making it harder to comment on this one without giving away Part 3's surprises.  The movie focuses on the corporation finally getting hold of actual Xenomorphs to begin work on their ultimate goal of turning them into biological weapons.  It's probably not giving anything away to say that the project doesn't go as the company had hoped.  Instead of going more into the plot I'll focus on the movie's strengths and weaknesses.  Strengths: a continued pattern of strong acting and well-done characters, with Annalee (Winona Ryder) being especially effective; tremendous effects for the creatures (including a radically new breed); an unexpectedly potent follow-up to the thread from the 'hive' scene in "Aliens" that implied that there actually is an emotional bond between at least some of the Xenomorphs.  Weaknesses: pretty glaring inconsistencies and implausibilities in the action, much more so than in "Aliens" (I'd cite examples but I'm running out of wordcount).<br /><br />  Overall, Alien is 4.5 stars, maybe even 5; "Aliens" is four stars, "Alien 3" a 5-star, and "Alien: Resurrection" 3-and-a-half stars.  I should round my mark to four but it's hard to resist giving this a five.  Having them all together like this makes the whole even greater than the sum of its parts.  The packaging is great, there's tonnes of bonus features for those who like them (personally I don't like going behind the scenes and seeing how something is made, although I did enjoy the short director introductions before each film), and it's currently going for $30 for NINE discs, which is pretty bloody impressive.  An essential for fans of horror, science fiction and action.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Forrest Gump"></head><body><p>I hated this movie at first. I had to go out in the lobby during the combat scene. Even though I did not go to Vietnam, I felt like I did. Forrest moves from Elvis and The Beatles to the disco era. He finds himself in Washington, D.C., the ordinary man caught up in extraordinary circumstances. I later developed an affection for Tom Hanks' character when I went to D.C. with my son. We joked about Forrest's girl friend, Jenny, running through the Reflecting Pool. The story ends with Jenny dying of AIDS. Seeing the quintessential boomer life unfold can be painful.</p></body></html>

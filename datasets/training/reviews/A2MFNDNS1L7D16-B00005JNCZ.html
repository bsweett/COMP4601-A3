<meta name="summary" content="Che is not the revolutionary he will become.."></head><body><p>This is a road trip north 4000 miles starting from Buenos Aires. The ride is a piece of junk posing as a motorcycle. It is sold halfway through to raise money for a poor family they encounter along the way. They are desparately poor & persecuted by the local authorities for being communists.<br /><br />  Che & his buddy Alberto are newly minted doctors & have decided to take the scenic route to a leper colony in the north. The movie touches a lot of social conscience chords but doesn't hammer home any ideology. It is there always in the background similiar to Y Tu Mama Tambien. The movie also has the same unseen narrator style to move the story along. A lot of adventures & a lot of humor make this  intelligent & highly recommended.  It is a road trip, buddy movie, but also so much more.</p></body></html>

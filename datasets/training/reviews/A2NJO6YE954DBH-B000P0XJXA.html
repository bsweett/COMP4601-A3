<meta name="summary" content="A twisted kidnapping tale courtesy of David Mamet"></head><body><p>I wish I had known that &quot;Spartan&quot; was written and directed by David Mamet before I started watching it because then I would have warmed up to the movie a lot more quickly.  Doing so was a problem for me because this film pushed a couple of my buttons.  First, it involves the kidnapping of the president's daughter.  My complain is not that this has been happening a lot (e.g., &quot;The West Wing&quot;), but that doing these stories at a time when the sitting president has daughters and there are ample reasons for terrorists to make them targets might be tempting fate too much.  Second, it also touches on the idea of Secret Service incompetence and culpability in political shenanigans.  I get the feeling that the Secret Service in most Hollywood movies has replaced what would have been psychotic Vietnam vets a generation ago (and sadistic Nazis the generation before that).  I just tend to find such portrayals rather insulting to those people whose job is to throw themselves in front of bullets.<p>But even given the hole that &quot;Spartan&quot; started out with in my eyes this is quite a compelling film.  With Mamet things are never simple and the chief attraction here is how the film's hero, an agent named Scott (Val Kilmer), tries to catch up with the events that are unraveling at warp speed involving the president's daughter (Kristen Bell), and unraveling is most decidedly the operative word in this story.  I probably should have started counting the conventions of this genre that Mamet is playing with in &quot;Spartan,&quot; especially with regards to the supporting roles of Curtis (Derek Luke), Jackie Black (Tia Texada), and Stoddard (William H. Macy), who come and go in the most interesting ways.  Scott is an interesting character because he is almost a sanctioned loose cannon, who will put on his thinking cap and do whatever it takes to get the job done (even if it means doing whatever it takes to get the job done).<p>Of course as much fun as a David Mamet plot is there is also the distinctive dialogue that he gives his characters to speak.  If you are hoping for lots of exposition to explain what is going on, then you are in the wrong movie.  Add to that the fact that just because somebody says something does not mean they mean it.  There is a lot of guesswork involved here, not just for the characters but also the audience, because of what we see and here.  But that is the road we expect to travel when Mamet is out guide and in that regard &quot;Spartan&quot; does not disappoint.  It might prove too cerebral for most aficionados of the action genre, but then there are plenty of such brain dead films out there that we should be allowed to enjoy this one in peace.</p></body></html>

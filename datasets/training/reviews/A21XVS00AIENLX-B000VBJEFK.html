This is probably the most contemporary of all the Disney films to date with a plot semi-complex for some kids.  Adult will understand it a little more, but as always, Disney's attention to detail and the minutia in their animation is mind-blowing.  Pay particular attention to the cooking utensils and kitchen as well as the panoramic view of Paris.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="To criticize Casablanca..."></head><body><p>is, in one sentence, to completely misunderstand what the movies are all about, and have been since their inception. Of course it's a dramatic love story, one of 50 made that year, but it's not JUST that; it's indisputably one of the 3 best films ever made, end of story. It's got every ingredient that makes a great film great. To call it old-fashioned, or something that hasn't aged well, or out of touch, again, only serves to underscore your gross ignorance of cinema as a whole. Look up the word "timeless" in your dictionary. Then watch Casablanca again. Repeat the process until you get it.<br />And if you're fortunate enough to haven't seen it yet... Don't read about it first; just watch it!</p></body></html>

Men will appericate the attitude depicted by Mel Gibson towards his love and his country along with the added violence. Women will swoon and pine for the hopeless romantic they will find in Mel as he avenges the death of his wife and fights for the freedom of his fellow countrymen. I have respect for Mel as a director.</p></body></html>

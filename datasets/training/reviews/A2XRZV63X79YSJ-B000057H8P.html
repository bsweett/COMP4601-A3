Then, he became one of MGM's most respected movie musical producers, the famous Freed unit.<br /><br />MGM decided to pay tribute to Freed by creating a movie around the songs that he wrote.  This became Singin' in the Rain.  Additionally as most of the songs were written for early movie musicals, therefore, the film is set in Hollywood at the advent of sound.<br /><br />Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly) and Lena Lamont (Jean Hagen) are the stars of Monumental Pictures.  Lena believes that Don and she are a personal couple besides an onscreen couple.  On the way to the premiere party for his latest film with Lena, Don meets movie star wannabe Cathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds).  It's love at first sight but Cathy doesn't want to admit it.<br /><br />But Don has bigger problems.  Talkies are coming.  Production is shut down on his current film while it is rewritten for talkies.  Don and Lena go into training for talkies.  Don takes to it perfectly, unfortunately Lena's voice is like nails on a chalkboard.<br /><br />Don tracks down Cathy and after a long night of commiserating with Don's best friend Cosmo (Donald O'Connor), the team come up with an idea on how to save the movie.  Lena will lip sync to Cathy's voice.<br /><br />All goes well at the movie premiere but Lena is blackmailing the studio to use Cathy as her voice in all her films.  In the end, Lena is her own worst enemy.  Cathy and Don live happily ever after on and off the screen.<br /><br />This is a light piece of fluff that perfectly captured the early days of Hollywood.  Broadway librettists Betty Comden and Aldoph Green wrote the screenplay.  Having a team that understands book musicals and movie musicals helped with creating the films authentic flavor.  And having film veteran director Stanley Donen paired with star Kelly as co directors works extremely well and adds depth.  Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor by this time were film veterans.  While for Debbie Reynolds this was her first musical and she actually proved to up to the veterans.<br /><br />The big movie within the movie production number is a classic re-teaming Kelly and Cyd Charisse.<br /><br />DVD EXTRAS:<br /><br />Disc One -<br /><br />Commentary by Debbie Reynolds with Donald O'Connor, Cyd Charisse, Kathleen Freeman, Stanley Donen, Betty Comden, Adloph Green, Baz Luhrman and film historian Rudy Behlmer.<br /><br />Singin' Inspirations - Seven additional sequences from other films or newsreels are referenced into the film.

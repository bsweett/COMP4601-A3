<meta name="summary" content="Adams Chronicles"></head><body><p>We liked JUNEBUG so much that we consulted IMDB to find out what Amy Adams was up to next, and the database spat out the name of TALLADEGA NIGHTS.  To our surprise, Frabk Hoyt Taylor, who memorably played the fiery, pathetic old "outsider artist" specializing in crudely drawn portraits of Civil War genitals, was said to feature in TALLADEGA also.  Well so there we were and for a few minutes we might almost have been watching JUNEBUG 2, for the first movie ends with a young couple reuniting after some disputes, driving down a long Southern highway in the moonlight, while TALLADEGA NIGHTS opens up with Gary Cole and Jane Lynch driving down a lonesome road, but after that the two pictures veer wildly, and to tell you the truth, Amy Adams was admirable in JUNEBUG, but lousy in this one, and as for crazy old Frank Hoyt Tayler, we never did spot him!  Even his own mother, if he had one, would be hard pressed to pick him out to the sea of hillbilly humanity that is THE BALLAD OF RICKY BOBBY.<br /><br />The love story, and that's stretching it, is supposed to be a little like the one in THE SURE THING, where our hero is so knocked out by the sensual appeal of his dream girl, that he doesn't notice that his plain little girl pal is really the one for him.  That's a hard part to play, the caterpillar who becomes a butterfly when she pulls her T-shirt up over her chest, and Amy Adams does it as if under protest, gritting her teeth and despising herself and her agents for allowing her to undergo what Meryl Streep never had to.  That said, the movie is hilarious and the other girl, Leslie Bibb, seems to glory in being dumb as a post, like the ex-wife in MY NAME IS EARL, she is having some serious fun.<br /><br />When Ricky Bobby has to choose between the two girls, and chooses the caterpillar over the sex bomb, the movie deflates a little, like a tire what picked up a rusty ole nail.</p></body></html>

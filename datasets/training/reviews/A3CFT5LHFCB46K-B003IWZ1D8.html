But this movie is far more than that. It is a deep psychological thriller, with Anthony Perkins giving a signature performance as the disturbed Norman Bates. <p>Marion Crane (Janet Leigh in another signature performance) is a thief who is on the run after stealing some money. On her way, she stops over at the Bates Motel, little knowing what is in store for her. But Norman Bates doesn't kill Marion because of himself but because of his mother, who is jealous at her. But who really is Norman's mother? Who really is Norman? <p>Recently the American Film Institute, in another controversial list, named "Psycho" as "America's Most Thrilling Movie". It is no surprise, considering its many famous and surprising scenes, including the ending. This film has been the inspiration of many horror movies like "Halloween", "Friday the 13th" and "Scream". It has been parodied and spoofed countless times and has even been followed up by sequels and a remake (None of which were particularly good). But even after all this plus 4 decades of age, the movie has lost none of its original power.</p></body></html>

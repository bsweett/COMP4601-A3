<meta name="summary" content="High-Octane Heist"></head><body><p>THE ITALIAN JOB is billed as a remake of a popular Michael Caine movie from 1969, but it is so highly inventive in most aspects that it's really more of an original.  The movies still occupies itself with a daring robbery of gold bricks involving managing traffic and the use of mini-Coopers, and some of the characters even have the same names as the first movie.  However, the remake is a definite thriller that is guaranteed to stoke the adrenaline levels of watchers everywhere.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg stars as Charlie Croker.  Donald Sutherland plays John Bridger, his criminal mastermind mentor.  It's this relationship, along with Charlize Theron as his estranged daughter Stella, that really drives the movies.  Edward Norton plays the bad guy, while Jason Statham, Seth Green, Mos Def, and Franky G round out the crew.<br /><br />The movie opens with a fantastic bit that establishes the relationship between Croker and Bridger, then moves smoothly into an action riff that eats up screen footage and shows off Venice and the canals.  After a double-cross in the Swiss Alps, the movie skips ahead a year and introduces us to Stella Bridger.  Stella makes her living as a professional safecracker who uses her powers for good.  Charlie talks to her, telling her they've finally tracked down the man who killed her father, and he offers her a place on the team to get revenge.<br /><br />From that point on, the movie sprints forward into a rapid-fire game of cat and mouse between our heroes and the bad guy.  It plays out like a chess battle, but accelerated to tire-screeching hairpin twists and turns.<br /><br />The Blu-ray edition of the movies is awesome.  The video content is so clear in Venice that you'll swear you're on the canals yourself.  Director F. Gary Gray's pacing and shots are designed to thrill, and they do.  The picture is absolutely stunning.  The audio quality is pretty amazing as well, but the studio opted for the Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound effect instead of going all out for uncompressed sound.<br /><br />The bottom line is that you do get a much better picture with the high-def version on a high-def monitor, but the sound could have been better.  You won't be upgrading your sound, but purchasing the disc will definitely upgrade your video presentation.  The special features included on the disc have already been packaged, so they don't add anything new.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Who else could turn boys into cowboys but John Wayne?"></head><body><p>If you stop and think about it John Wayne actually made several westerns that took surprising twists.  In &quot;The Searchers,&quot; Wayne played Ethan Edwards, who spends the entire film tracking the neice who had been taken by Scar's band of raiders so that he can put a bullet in her brain, only to end up taking her home.  But for his legion of fans, &quot;The Cowboys&quot; had to be the biggest surprise of all.<p>As rancher Wil Andersen, Wayne finds that his hands have left him to join a gold rush and he has no one to help him get his herd of cattle to market before winter. His only option are a group of young school boys, a hot headed young gun man named Cimarron (A Martinez), and an old cook named Jedediah Nightlinger (Roscoe Lee Browne).  With hardly any training, Anderson and his &quot;cowboys&quot; hit the trail.  But not only do they have to do deal with hundreds of heads of cattle, rattlesnakes, and the elements, there are also a gang of man led by Asa Watts (Bruce Dern) following them as well.<p>I think that Bruce Dern had a pretty good career after this 1972 film, which was in doubt at that time because his character shoots down John Wayne in cold blood, which was definitely not considered a smart career move at the time.  Wayne warned Dern he would be hated and the young actor actually received death threats.  A movie in which John Wayne actually dies is always something of a shock for movie goers (e.g., &quot;Sands of Iwo Jima&quot;), but usually that tragic fate is saved for the very end of the film and in &quot;The Cowboys&quot; there is still the entire final act of the story left to be told.  The one thing you have to admit is that no other actor being killed off in the middle of a western could shock you more than the Duke.<p>Of the young cast of the film, Robert Carradine is the one name that sticks out the most as having made a career of acting.  A few of the boys were cast in the short lived television series based on the movie but just as many did this one film and never acted again.  However, the choice performances in &quot;The Cowboys&quot; come from the older cast members, with Brown's eloquent Mr. Nightlinger having a choice encounter with Colleen Dewhurst, who plays a madam escorting her stable of pretty young women to their next town of business.  Of course, the young girls are interested in the young boys, but as she wisely declares, &quot;The first time should be in the back of a buggy with a girl that they think they're in love with.&quot;  Then there is his charming refusal, &quot;I have the inclination, the maturity, and the where-with-all; but unfortunately, I don't have the time.&quot;<p>Of course Wayne's character slowly comes around to the idea that these young cowboys can actually get the job done, but the film requires them to complete their final rite of passage without him.  This 1972 western provides Wayne with the final great fist fight of his career that say him make 174 films from 1926 when he was an uncredited Yale football player in &quot;Brown of Harvard&quot; to 1976 when he starred in his eloquent final film &quot;The Shootist.&quot;  When Andersen begins his final fight his tells his opponent: &quot;I've broke my back once, and my hip twice. And on my worst day I could still beat the hell out of you.&quot;  Yes, Bruce Dern must be a pretty good actor to survive shooting John Wayne in the back.</p></body></html>

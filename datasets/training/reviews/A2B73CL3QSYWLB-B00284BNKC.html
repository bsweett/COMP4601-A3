<meta name="summary" content="Powerful Portait of Addiction"></head><body><p>This is not merely a great film but an important one.  Granted, the majority of the population would find this harrowing film offputting, however, because drugs and addiction are so woven into the framework of our society it is important that this film be seen by as many people as possible.  When the film started, I didn't no where it was going.  Once it established it's rhythm, detailing the high highs and low lows of chemical dependency this film takes hold of you and doesn't let go.  Credit for this has to go to director Darren Aronofsky who establishes himself as a new and creative force in film-making.  It seems like this film was made a long time ago and I eagerly await viewing his next project(that said, I wasn't too partial to "PI").  The ensemble acting in this film is superb.  Jennifer Connelly is a stand-out as a heroine addict who ultimately succumbs to the worse kind of degradation to support her habit.  The ultimate praise, however, is reserved for Ellen Burstyn.  She not only gives a great performance but an acting performance for the ages.  Her character breaks your heart from start to finish.  The movie begins with her enabling her heroine addict son by allowing him to steal her beloved TV and ends with her being subjected to drug-treatment for becoming adicted to amphetamines because she wanted to look good for the all-important TV.  This is a great film whose reputation I hope only grows through the years.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Horror Flick That Really Holds Up"></head><body><p>Even though it's thirty-four years old the horror flick "Carrie" (1976), made from the Stephen King novel, is still a very absorbing and chilling film. The young Sissy Spacek was perfect for the part, that thin body, those wide eyes with their translucent pupils, the whitest, palest of skins, that quality of other-worldliness, as if she's from another galaxy. Her classmates are stereotypical brats, and a few clich&eacute;s erupt here and there - in fact, the only character who isn't a caricature is her gym teacher, the actress Betty Buckley.<br />Carrie's mother (Piper Laurie) is a Bible-thumping fanatic who could drive any daughter round the bend. Carrie White has super-developed kinetic powers that can make her move objects or people wherever she wills them to go. The final scenes in the gym on prom night when she really lets go are horrific. It's a wild climactic scene. How they ever made this into a musical, I'll never know. Betty Buckley was in it, and it flopped.<br />You don't want to play nasty tricks on Carrie because she can get back at you in spades. The initial shower scene in the film with adolescent female nudity was and is quite daring. When Carrie discovers menstruation, her female classmates turn vicious. Director Brian De Palma guides his film through the treacherous shoals of teenage cruelty, and even the young John Travolta shows up briefly to play a Neanderthal goof.<br />The movie holds up well and is worth watching to see Spacek's brilliant portrayal.</p></body></html>

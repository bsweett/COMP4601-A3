<meta name="summary" content="An ultra-violent mind-bend"></head><body><p>Doug Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) thinks he is just an ordinary construction worker who dreams of moving to Mars. However, after a spur-of-the-moment visit to Recall (a company that implants false memories of holidays into the minds of people who are too busy or too poor to go on them), Quaid suddenly starts to remember a previous life that he lived on Mars as a secret agent. Soon Quaid is being chased by a lot of people who want to kill him and he is no longer sure of who to trust, including his wife (Sharon Stone) and himself.<br /><br />"Total Recall" is a rarity among action films - a film with an intelligent, mind-bending script that is also filled with some incredible set pieces. It can be enjoyed for its story or if you prefer, you can just sit back and enjoy the mindless violence. Either way, it's a really great film. When this film was made, Schwarzenegger was at the height of his career, as was director Paul Verhoeven (who also directed "Robocop") and Stone was about to reach the height of hers (she would reach that two years later when she and Verhoeven again worked together on "Basic Instinct"). Neither Schwarzenegger nor Stone has ever been accused of being a "great" actor, but that doesn't mean that they're not fun to watch, as is the case here. Arnie gets to deliver some great one-liners and kick butt, and as usual, Stone adds a certain trashy quality to the proceedings.<br /><br />Paul Verhoeven is fast becoming one of my favourite directors and "Total Recall" has just become my second favourite of his films (after "Starship Troopers"). Verhoeven has a reputation for delivering films with huge amounts of gratuitous, over-the-top violence and he does it again here (although, clearly some of the more violent scenes have been cut down to get a lower rating, since the violence seems kind of tame compared to the "Robocop" director's cut). As I said in my recent review of "Robocop", it is possible that these high levels of violence could upset some viewers. However, to me they seem so unrealistic that I find it difficult to imagine anyone seeing them as being anything other than ridiculous good fun.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Biggest disappointment of 2006"></head><body><p>This movie is based on the first book of a three-series trilogy inspired by the LOTR movies.  I have not read any of the books, and will only comment on the movie as a stand-alone piece of work.  The strongest impression I had of this movie is the amatuerish feel of everything, including the dialogue, acting, action scenes, story line, and soundtrack.<br /><br />First, the dialogue was simple and boring, full of short sentences and seemed to be ripoffs from other movies.  For example, there is a scene when an evil sorcerer named Durza leads an army of grotesque humanoid creatures into battle.  From the setting of the scene, to the way it was shot, seemed like a total copy of the scene in LOTR: Two Towers when Saruman sends his Uruk-Hai army of to battle.<br /><br />Second, the acting was horrible.  From the death scene of Brom, to King Galbatorix's musings on his throne, most of the serious scenes looked fake.  One good example is after Eragon finds his uncle dead.  Brom tries to take him away and Eragon resists with angry words but weak actions.  Brom easily puts him on a horse and leads him away.  It seems Eragon knew the entire time he had to leave, but was just trying to throw a tantrum.  A more realistic version would be to have Eragon resist Brom violently, and the latter having to knock out the former with a good punch in the face.<br /><br />Third, the action scenes were very disappointing.  This is most apparent at the end when Galbatorix's army invades the land of the Varden.  The ensuing swordfights looked totally staged, and there were several times when two swords are supposed to clash, but no sound is heard.<br /><br />Fourth, the story line was full of holes.  The entire battle scene seems to belong to the bad guys, but somehow the good guys end up victorious by the movie's end.  How did this happen?  Also, who teaches the dragon Saphira how to breathe fire.  One moment she blows hot air; then after one night with the Varden she can blow streams of fire.<br /><br />The soundtrack was also a big disappointment.  I heard one tune repeated over and over again for all the action scenes.  The rest of the movie the soundtrack was unnoticeable.  Of all the recent fantasy movies so far; LOTR, Harry Potter, Chronicles of Narnia and this, this movie has the worst soundtrack.<br /><br />Overall, a bad viewing experience.  It was not the worst movie of 2006, but for the hype it received, it was the biggest disappointment.  Unfortunately, the ending scene promises that a sequel is in the works.</p></body></html>

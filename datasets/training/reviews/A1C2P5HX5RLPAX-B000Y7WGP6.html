<meta name="summary" content="Revenge Never Ends"></head><body><p>This is one of the best films I've seen in a long time. Good direction by Peter Berg (who also makes a guest appearance). Even though the content is emotionally charged this is a character driven movie. With the leads of two different sides conflicting but coming together to work on the same goal--Finding the evil doers. Special Kudos to Ashraf Barhom (Colonel Ghazi and Jason Bateman (Adam Leavitt). From the beginning you become attached to the scene and what is going on. The special effects are well done and a painful tension is maintained throughout the whole film. Not everyone makes it out alive and the losses are unexpected. I highly recommend this film which in the end delivers a never ending message.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Matador is a film not to be missed (unless you're a bull)"></head><body><p>The Matador is a slightly off-kilter, pleasantly surprising movie that gently leads the viewer on a tour of unpredictability. Richard Shepard wrote and directed this little gem of a film in his well-deserved departure from smaller independent films to a full-budgeted film. He makes great use of his new resources, recruiting cinematographer David Tattersall (Die Another Day, Star Wars I-III, The Green Mile). Tattersall makes every frame thrilling and adds even more to Brosnan and Kinnear's performances.<br /><br />Now that we're on the subject, Pierce Brosnan really shines as hitman Julian Noble, a character that seems to have been written for him to make a perfect transition, shedding his James Bond image without completely losing it. As Noble begins to fall apart, Brosnan gets to show that not only is he charming, and deboinair, he's also a brilliant actor with great control on a depth of emotions. His Golden Globe nomination was well deserved.<br /><br />Greg Kinnear gives an equally transfixing performance as Danny Wright, a down on his luck business man who meets Julian on a trip to Mexico, where the two share an unidentifiable bond. Kinnear has an almost unique ability in Hollywood to portray a general sense of optimism, while also relaying a clear sense of desperation to the audience. He shines in this film in a prelude to the down-on-his-luck character he plays in Little Miss Sunshine.<br /><br />Hope Davis doesn't have as big a role as either of the male leads, but she makes a strong showing and through her ability to translate the script into clear emotions she manages to stand out as more than just a "wife" character. The three main cast members really make this film work.<br /><br />In the end, surprisingly, The Matador is a slightly sentimental - without being cheesy - examination of friendship, love, devotion, and doing what's right. The audience will leave the film feeling satisfied, entertained, and a little bit better about life in general. Don't miss out on this one.<br /><br />The DVD includes several deleted scenes and a making of documentary that offers some insight into the director's take on the film. It's all interesting, but the film stands on its own.</p></body></html>

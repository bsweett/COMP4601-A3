That's basically what this title is about. 3.65 stars."></head><body><p>All I remember is that 11 innocent guys who are half naked get shot for no reason at all. They're totally innocent and didn't even deserve to die based on what we knew about them which was next to nothing.<br /><br />I remember killing people with guns and people blowing up by bomb implants by phone. The caller calls the receiver picks up and BAM.<br /><br />Then I remember the main character having a family and being with them and such but that's about it.<br /><br />I also recall it being a "war thing" as far as the killings went. The killers had next to no remorse and they cared not of their worried-sick families. I also recall families watching the news about the hostages being safe and then being slaughtered. The families were so distraught and full of sorrow and pouring tears. :^(<br /><br />That's all I can recover from my memory banks.<br /><br />My personal moral: War sucks, Guys.<br /><br />Cover Art: C-<br />Story: C-<br />Dialogue: C-<br />Characters: C<br />Length: D+<br />Overall: C<br /><br />3.65 stars.</p></body></html>

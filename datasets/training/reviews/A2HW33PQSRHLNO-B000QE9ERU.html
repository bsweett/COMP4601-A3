I was right.<br /><br />This is an aborted attempt at translating a very different kind of "hero" a la Marvel comics to the screen.  It had been done before, and it was pretty bad then too.  (Anyone remember Ivan Drago from "Rocky IV"?  He played The Punisher a little better than Tom Jane in this movie, and that should be all you need to know about the quality of the acting here.)<br /><br />The job of "The Punisher" in this film is to strut around without a shirt on, act like a darker Toby Keith/gunslingin' coolguy, and take vengeance on the people who murdered his family.  Keep in mind he's been shot five, six times on the orders of John Travolta (he's a gangster with a big car lot and people who dress in all black).  Was he at least seriously injured.  Nah.  Some voodoo witch doctor black guy who just happened to be around when the slaughter of his family took place and was also miraculously unharmed fixed him in a day or two.<br /><br />Nope. Frank Castle, this seemingly invincible cop who is bent on smoking cigarettes and drinking hard liquor while plotting revenge, doesn't even have a scar on this body after being blown up and shot multiple times.<br />He is miraculously delivered back to the exact city in a very short time and begins a game of bloodthirsty "intrigue" using one of the villain's henchmen so obvious and predictable it makes Andy Warhol's movie "Sleep"<br />seem unpredictable.<br /><br />But the other people who live in the apartment with Jane's Punisher--fatboy, loser, and reformed heroin addict potential love interest--put the nails in the already descending coffin of this awful excuse for a movie.  They are so badly drawn and so badly acted that you wonder if they are going to fall off the screen or start laughing wildly.  They try a few "Leave It To Beaver" moments in between Castle's drinking and intent haunted gaze on his firearms.<br /><br />But he is so haunted, vengeful, so cool that he can't work up too much dialogue with them.  That might have required some acting.  He's the demented silent type, a less talented Gary Cooper with a different agenda.  A big Russian guy (an extra from Barnum and Bailey's?) and Castle have a big brawl, each suffering injuries that would knock anyone unconscious or kill them very quickly.  Another thing: The Punisher, though mortal as anyone else, does not seem to have the problem of blood loss.<br /><br />In a completely cold, bland, and unmoving series of Cowboy Draw Your Gun pastiche, Castle takes his vengeance on the ever absent Howard Saint (John Travolta is who you see, but he's supposed to playing a role with that name).  Then, ripping off "The Crow" (an actually good movie about vigilantism), he sets ablaze the ominously luxuriant parking lot of this arch criminal.<br /><br />"The Punisher" is one of the most disturbing and well written characters in the history of Marvel.  It is sad indeed that any Hollywood exec with a reachable cellphone number and a chunk of change can take rich art and trash it like this.</p></body></html>

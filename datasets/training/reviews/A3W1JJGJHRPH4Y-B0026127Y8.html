The movie was exactly what was advertised.  The plot was tight. The action sequences were well done. Neeson was very good. Neeson played the part of a father trying to establish a relationship with his estranged daughter very well. The movie kept me at the edge of my seat. I enjoyed it. The movie wasn't Shakespeare: the dialog was kept to minimum. The torture sequences were hard to watch, but there are movies out there much more violent. The movie didn't make the protag<br />onist a superman, but a middled-aged man with very good fighting skills.<br /><br />I don't know if I recommend buying it, but I definitely would watch it again.</p></body></html>

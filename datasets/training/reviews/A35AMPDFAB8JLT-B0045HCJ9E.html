This comedy/thriller rolls right along for its duration as Cary Grant's character is constantly on the run for his life. This blu-ray is beautifully remastered in 1080p with an aspect ratio of 1.85:1 in Dolby TrueHD 5.1. This blu-ray book set includes a new 2009 Documentary about Alfred Hitchcock ("Hitchcock's Signature Style"), a feature length profile about Cary Grant ("A Class Apart"), an in depth exploration of "North by Northwest"("One for the Ages"), a 2000 documentary ("Destination Hitchcock:The Making of North by Northwest"), gallery stills, a  music-only audio track, as well as printed material about Cary Grant,  James Mason, Eva Marie Saint, screenwriter Ernest Lehman, Alfred Hitchcock, and an essay entitled the "Ultimate Wrongman", along with countless photos of posters, sets pieces, the actors between scenes, et cetera. This is a nice overall package of a great movie.</p></body></html>

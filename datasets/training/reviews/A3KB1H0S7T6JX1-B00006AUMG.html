<meta name="summary" content="Beware of the Reapers..."></head><body><p>The film brings back to the screen the story of Blade, the vampire hunter, himself a human-vampire hybrid in which he must ally with his enemies in order to prevent a new breed of vampires from taking over.  It is a highly entertaining, action-packed adventure/thriller with significant elements of horror.<br /><br />Wesley Snipes, Kris Kristofferson, Leonor Varela, Ron Perlman, and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well, though the choice of Norman Reedus as Scud was poor at best as he does overdo it with his character's "attitude;" it gets tiring, not to mention extremely annoying after a while (but then again that could have been done on purpose in order to pave the way for his "ending").  In any case, he is not convincing in his role.<br /><br />Aside from that, the plot, the setting, the special effects, the MUSIC, and the swordfights are all EXCELLENT!  Blade is a movie guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment.</p></body></html>

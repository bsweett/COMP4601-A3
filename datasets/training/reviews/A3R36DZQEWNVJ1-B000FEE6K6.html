<meta name="summary" content="Cage gives another terrific performance in Lord Of War..."></head><body><p>Nicolas Cage (Face/Off, Family Man, upcoming Weather Man) stars as Yuri Orlov, who is an arms dealer who sells guns to people in other countries....where their for he gets money. Along the while he has a brother named Vitaly, played nicely by Jared Leto (Alexander, Requiem For A Dream, Urban Legend) but here's the thing, Vitaly has a cocaine problem and tends to bring hooker like women around all the time. Leto helps his brother Cage in the business. Cage falls for once glamour modle Ava Fontaine, played by Bridget Moynahan (Sum Of All Fears, The Recruit), the fall in the love and have a kid named Nicky. Cage buys her nice things, clothes, jewerly in the process. Ethan Hawke (Assault On Precinct 13, Tape, Taking Lives) plays Agent Jack Valentine who will do anything to bring down Cage and him manufactoring guns...in which case it wont happen because there's a lot more people around the world who manufactor guns as well. Cage brings life to his performance in Yuri...terrific as always Cage is....and I dont think any other actor would be right for the role. In the same vein as Three Kings. One of the best movies of the year...right up there with Crash and Sin City...well, that's just me for ya anyway. Also starring Ian Holm (Lord OF The Rings Trilogy, Aviator).</p></body></html>

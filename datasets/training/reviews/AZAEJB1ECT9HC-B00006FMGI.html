<meta name="summary" content="A Fairly Average Bond Movie"></head><body><p>Die Another Day was the film released to celebrate Bond's 40th anniversary in the movies.  It was also Brosnan's 4th and last appearance as Bond.  To be honest, its a fairly average Bond film and the weakest of Brosnan's 4 films.  Brosnan's James Bond films started at the top with the terrific Goldeneye and slowly worked their way downward with each film.<br />Each Bond film since Goldeneye have been incredibly successful.  However, the 2 best Bond films "Goldeneye" and "Casino Royale" have been directed by 1 man:Martin Campbell who did a fabulous job on both of those films.  The other 4 of the last 6 have been directed by different director with varying results.  This one was directed by Lee Tamahori, who not long afterward was arrested for solicitation.(Remember the good old days when Terrence Young directed 3 out of the 4 first great Bond films and John Glen directed Roger Moore's last three and Timothy Dalton's 2 excellent Bond films.  I do not like having a different director on each new film and hearing how great they've done because the film makes money.  The last Bond film "Quantum of Solace" was as mediocre as this one.  Yet I've heard the director Marc Forster proclaimed a genius because the film made boatloads of money. I hope he never does another one.)  As stated the film is average with the high point being a vicious swordfight between Bond and the villain.  Low points of this film included a terrible CGI sequence of Bond basically surfing over a tidal wave (don't even ask how this occurs) and Bond driving a stealth (invisable) car.  The film got a lot of publicity by having Halle Berry as the leading lady, right after she won her Oscar.  She is okay but I prefer the frosty Rosamund Pike as the secondary female lead.  The pre-credits sequence and conclusion are average by Bond standards.  (The film does try something new by having Bond captured at the end of the pre-credits sequence and tortured throughout most of the opening credits.)  The very average theme song was done by Madonna, who has a cameo in the film as a fencing instructor lusting after the lovely Rosamund Pike.<br />As stated, by Bond standards this isn't even close to the great films in the series.  It also was not a great film for Pierce Brosnan to go out on.  I always felt he had at least 2 more Bonds in him.  I guess the producers got tired of hearing him badmouth each film afterward and talk about things like wanting Quentin Tarantino to direct a Bond film.  However the producers have got to be jumping for joy after the grosses of Daniel Craig's 2 Bonds.<br />The extras on the blu-ray are basically the same as on the DVD.</p></body></html>

His mother tells him to decide what he wants to do with his toys, whether they should be donated, put up in the attic, or tossed out. What will become of the toys who need affection, but who never age but can get broken or worn out? The only one he has decided to take with him to college is Woody, the cowboy, who is a replica of a television puppet series character. Through a mix-up, the mother puts out with the rubbish a bag of toys meant for the attic. Luckily the toys escape from the jaws of the trash truck, but they blame Andy for throwing them out. They climb into a box meant for donation to a pre-school nursery.<br />The toys are donated to Sunnyside Daycare. The boss of the toys there (a villain) is teddy-bear Lotso (voice of Ned Beatty). He makes sure that Andy's toys go in the room where a bunch of unruly kids are very rough on the toys and hurl them around. Woody helps to rescue them from this place of horrors. Buzz Lightyear is a featured toy. A new toy is introduced, Ken (voice of Michael Keaton), of the Barbie family, and he and Barbie click. Later there are some heart-stopping moments in the dump when you fear that the toys are going to end up in the jaws of the trash crusher.<br />The tradition of high quality in this series is maintained in this which may be the last in the series. It is one of the best of the animated series ever made. It makes this gang of toys almost into real people with each of the toy characters having an individualized personality. Audiences get emotionally involved; they care about these toys as they would about people. The toys become a family and are interdependent. That is the magic of the films' creators. The voices of Tom Hanks and of the other major stars help to delineate these toy characters. And let's remember there's a lot of comedy in this enterprise.<br />It's a highly imaginative, funny, and emotionally gripping story for adults as well as kids. It's an interesting ironic situation: the human beings are robotic and stagy: the toys are more human than the human beings. These movie are high points in the evolution of animated films.</p></body></html>

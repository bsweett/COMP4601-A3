<meta name="summary" content="SAD, FUNNY AND TRUE-LIFE"></head><body><p>I read reviews where people said the characters are unlikable. My wife dropped watching after 20 minutes saying two main characters are jerks and she doesn't feel any empathy for them. Well, all I can say - don't stop watching after the beginning - this movie really deserves to be seen. Giamatti's and Church's characters may not be role models but they are truthful and full of life. This is very true-life film in general. The genre is hard to define, it's just a movie about life.<br /><br />Characters are very vivid, situations are real, relashionship is full of nuances, "Sideways" sometimes are extremely funny and very sad also. You really start feeling compassion towards the characters especially if you try to imagine yourself in their shoes. And especially if you're a man. Because practically Giamatti and Church personify here two types of men that exist on our planet. So anyway you can identify yourself with one or another. Both are lonely although differently, both are struggling to find themselves in life although again their lives and nature are very different. They try to find love and some meaning as all of us so I can't imagine this movie leaving someone apathetic. It's really touching and although it's not a tear-jerker sometimes you feel like crying. And don't be ashamed of it - it's a real man's movie and those will be real man's tears.</p></body></html>

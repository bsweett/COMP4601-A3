But you throw in a space/time continuum component in a chick flick and I'm scratching my head and getting lost faster than a fourth grader in a quantum physics course.  Alas, such is the case with Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock, and THE LAKE HOUSE.  I watched this flick twice, and my head still hurts.  For instance:<br /><br />1.  If we accept the premise there are parallel universes (allowing Keanu and Sandra to correspond simultaneously, even though they are two years apart), how can the two actually interact in Keanu's universe?  If I remember my "Star Trek" factoids, don't people like implode when they occupy two universes at once?<br /><br />2.  (Spoiler Alert!)  And if Keanu dies on Valentine's Day 2006 (but then later on gets a heads up from Sandra not to cross that busy street) and then asks his brother what day it is (and his brother says, "It's Valentine's Day 2006") and thereby avoids his date with destiny, then at the end of the movie the two lovers finally meet and Sandra says, "You waited two years," doesn't that mean it is now Valentine's Day 2008?  So this movie takes place in the future?<br /><br />3.  What's with the mailbox?  Keanu and Sandra both wait patiently at the Lake House, watching the mailbox. . .and then the flag mysteriously rises, indicating a letter will appear inside.  If the flag rises wouldn't that mean the parallel universes have again intertwined, whereby the two could interact (see Point 1 above)?<br /><br />4.  Poor Morgan (Dylan Walsh).  He really has the hots for Sandra, but she never gets more than lukewarm for him.  Yet he hangs on in the relationship.  Dumb Morgan.<br /><br />I could go on and on (and on).  Oh, and Keanu is as wooden as the desk I'm typing on, and Sandra is one ultra-depressed chick.  And Christopher Plummer is ageless.  That's it:  Plumber jumps from universe to universe; that's how he stays young.  Pass the aspirin.  2.5 stars.<br />--D. Mikels, beleaguered author, WALK-ON</p></body></html>

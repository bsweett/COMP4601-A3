Director Alexander Payne took a gigantic risk in choosing non superstar actors for major roles- Paul Giamatti (Miles) and Alexander Payne Thomas Hadden Church (Jack) and sending these two guys, facing various mid life difficulties, on a road trip just prior to Jack's upcoming wedding to a smart girl in San Diego. Miles is a failed novelist, sensitive intellectual and Pinot Noir quaffing wine snob who awaits news on his 750 page autobiographical novel which is churning around a small publishing house in New York, and looks forwards to a civilized, convivial week of good food and wine with his one time college roomate. Jack on the other hand is a compulsive ass chaser who wants one more bout of sexual freedom before he ties the knot. The friends' two personalities grate terrifically, which makes for some superb character comedy .<br /><br />Sideways works so well because the characters of Miles and Jack are so realistically and intelligently drawn by Payne, bringing them from Rex Pickett's novel to the screen with thoughtful dexterity. Every man at some point in his life has been a Miles (self pitying, depressed, anxious about his failings with women) or a Jack (anxious to get his rocks off), or if not has encountered men like this.<br /><br />The comedy is a mixture of high farce (the scenes when Jack is playing the field as ferociously as he can in his final pre- marital days), and the more poignant comedy of self absorbed anquish (such as when Miles pours the tasting bucket in a wine tasting bar over himself in a climactic moment of self loathing and mental collapse). The romantic sagas of the two guys perfectly reflects their characters. Jack wastes no time in going to bed with Stephanie (played by Sandra Oh who is one of those women with a unique, indefinable sex appeal) whereas Miles is more unnerved by the whole process and needs to be jolted into action by the almost implausibly tolerant Maya (Virginia Madsen). The sexual tension between them allows some poignant scenes. Miles, unable to communicate his emotions in bare form uses wine as a metaphor for his existence - he adores Pinot Noir because it is a delicate grape that requires nurturing, not a survivor in all situations like the more common Cabernet (which reads obviously as a metaphor for the more sexually confident Jack).<br /><br />If there is a criticism, it is that the characters are perhaps too crassly drawn as representing the various totems of male mid life crisis too one sidedly, and the extras on the DVD are missable - a trite, self indulgent commentary on the movie by Giamatti and Hadden Church and some deleted scenes. But Sideways is an important film that suggests there is a potential for quality filmaking in contemporary Hollywood that doesn't solely involve one dimensional glamour models thrashing around in formulaic plots that touch the subtleties of human relationships not one jot.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Powerful, though problematic"></head><body><p>Park Chanwook's OLDBOY is a powerful movie, but I can't recommend it without some qualifications.<br /><br />OLDBOY is ostensibly a revenge tale, but, as our main character, Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik), closes in on the man who imprisoned him for 15 straight years, it turns into something a little deeper than its flashy Tarantino-esque style in its first hour may indicate: it turns into an almost poetic drama about the human cost of revenge. When you see our hero humiliated at the end, you won't think that revenge is sweet any longer. (Tarantino made an attempt at this at the end of KILL BILL, VOL. 2, but then Tarantino is perhaps too infatuated with obscure old movies to really be able to convincingly pull off such a humanistic gesture with the conviction Park shows in OLDBOY.)<br /><br />Revenge movies have always been somewhat morally problematic, especially in modern movies. It's become an action cliche that when someone close to a hero dies, the hero may show a flash of pain on his face, but then he'll collect himself, stand up, and go after his nemesis with even greater force. Obviously, it's an understandable impulse, revenge---but, as even Shakespeare tried to show in HAMLET, it's rarely as simple as that. My memory of HAMLET is a bit faulty, to be honest, but I remember that none of the characters were painted in broad strokes of black or white, and that Hamlet's quest for revenge had an effect on the people around him (especially his sister Ophelia). And of course there's Hamlet himself: thirsty for revenge, but always over-thinking his every move, perhaps too passive a character to ever carry out such a thing.<br /><br />OLDBOY is far from HAMLET, of course. But, in its own gritty way, its view of revenge---as an inhumanly vicious cycle---is similar. It may not have the nuances of Shakespeare, but it has a poetic intensity at the end of it that can only be described as "powerful."<br /><br />This could have been a great film, though, if Park didn't at times seem so eager to shock for the sake of shock. I mean, seriously (and I hope this isn't too much of a spoiler): did we really need the whole incest thing thrown in? And, of course, the violence is occasionally graphic, and filmed in a way that may lead some people to dismiss Park as un-serious in his mostly-pessimistic view of vengeance. There is one scene that is problematic in this regard: one in which Oh takes on a whole bunch of cronies wielding a hammer. Most of the fight is filmed in one long take, and it is probably a scene that wouldn't feel too much out of place in Tarantino's KILL BILL, VOL. 1 (you know, the more violent installment, heh). For a director who makes a big show of decrying the inhumanity of revenge, he does make some of the violence look awfully cool.<br /><br />But that's not being totally fair to Park, I don't think. Yeah, there are problems in OLDBOY, aspects in which Park's shock tactics go a little too far. Overall, though, I think this is one violent film that doesn't take the pain out of violence, both physical and emotional. You're not hyped up to cheer the revenger here; Oh Dae-su is a sympathetic but not necessarily likable hero (and the actor, Choi Min-sik, doesn't really attempt to make him likable, either). I mean, does he really have to rip the teeth out of a bad guy, like he does in one particularly gory scene? Park's point is that revenge has taken over Oh's life in such a way that it has made him less of a human being. Better this than the stupid (if technically well-made) action revenge sagas that Hollywood has occasionally produced in recent years. Recommended, with reservations.</p></body></html>

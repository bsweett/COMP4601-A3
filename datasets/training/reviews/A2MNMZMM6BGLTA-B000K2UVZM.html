<meta name="summary" content="Should Have Been Good"></head><body><p>This movie should have been good. It had a great concept and back story to work off of. It had a good cast, except for Josh Hartnett who is the blackhole of movies, and Scarlett Johansen is good in cutey roles and has nice assets but she is not a good dramatic actress in this kind of role. This movie just misses the mark on about every level. The only good thing is that the costumes and the portrayal of the period are both good. But seriously, and I wanted to like it, this movie sucked.</p></body></html>

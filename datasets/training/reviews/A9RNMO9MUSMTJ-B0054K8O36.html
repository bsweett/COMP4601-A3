There<br />is less glitter in his eyes as the previous pirate movies.<br />But with the boatload of money Disney has, this sequel was done and it does<br />look pretty with great sets, mermaids and other goodies.  I did watch it and<br />at some level it did entertain me but im really glad that i only rented it.</p></body></html>

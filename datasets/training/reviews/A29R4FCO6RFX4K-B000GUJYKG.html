The first (and best) in what would become a trilogy, Bruce Willis' first major action man role carries the distinction of being heralded as the greatest action movie ever made. It's title is debatable, but regardless, this movie is great! The action, stunts, uber-cool villains, one-liners, impressive FX and big noisy things exploding make this one of the all-time greats. McTiernan would go on to direct Die Hard with a Vengeance after Renny Harlin's mediocre Die Hard 2 and influenced countless other action films throughout the 80's and 90's.<p>This special edition DVD is one of the best on the market, loaded with extras.<br />Disc 1 includes a commentary by director John McTiernan and production designer Jackson DeGovia, and Disc 2 has outtakes, deleted scenes, the whole flippin' screenplay, awesome trailers, TV spots and DVD-ROM features with script-to-screen comparison and game demos and more cool stuff for die-hard Die Hard fans (Hey, that's where the saying comes from!) See? This movie has truly influenced countless action films but has also become a statement for all things sweaty and extreme. Yipee Kay Yay!</p></body></html>

Both lush and heartbreaking, it just sweeps you off your feet into this movie going experience that you rarely experience now a days, completly wrapping you in its spell that has you transfixed through out the entire film, from its tone setting beginning to its heart wrenching finale.<br /><br />On a particularily hot day in the English summer of 1935, young Briony Tallis witnesses a moment of sexual tension between her older sister, Cecily, and their housekeepers son Robbie. Far to young to understand the meaning of this event, she initially takes it as something negative and believes Robbie intends to harm her sister. So one night, she draws from her sexual naivete and childish ways to accuse Robbie of a crime he did not commit. Because of this small understanding and act of betrayel, Briony unwittingly sets into motion a series events that will ultimatly change the lives of her sister, Robbie, even herself for years to come.<br /><br />Technically wise, the film just exceeds beyond what you have seen on film. The cinamatography and art direction are just flat out stunning. Everything just seems to radiate this ethereal and richly refined look in almost every single frame, from the warm pastels of the hot English country side to the cold, grim gray's of WWII, its almost as if you are viewing a work of moving art or better yet, your actually seeing the texts from the book just come alive on screen, which in my opinion is a very difficult feat to achive with a book of such intrisant detail and depth. It baffled me that the film did not win in those awards at the Oscars, which I felt they rightfully deserved.<br /><br />All the acting is just phenomenal. Both Keira Knightly and James McAvoy are just fantastic as the star crossed lovers (and both shamefully snubbed by Oscar) and each three incarnations of Briony are all seemless. Saoirse Ronan shows off such a poise and grace that far succeds her teenage years as the young Briony, Romola Garai exudes a sense of remorse you can almost feel the weight of her actions on your shoulders, and finally, Venessa Redgrave tops it off in a devistating performance in just under seven minutes, all the sadness of her actions expressed in her eyes.<br /><br />Christopher Hampton does an excellent job on the screenplay, adapting from such a complex and deep book that can rarely ever be done. And Joe Wright just excels in the directors chair (especially with the now famous Dunkirk scene) turning what could have easily been another sappy love story into something far more complex, from acts of betrayle, effects of war, and the sheer fantasy of ones mind. The music score is just so unique the way the composer uses the sound of clacking typewriters, as if the events going on in the film are being written at that exact moment in Briony's mind. What I also love about the film is the way the characters speak and act, with the whole naturalistic manner you saw way back in the 1930's where the words were given very promptly and in a very direct speech, its like an almost modernized version of all those old classic films, which will definently appeal to an older audience. Now, on that note, some people may be turned off by the whole speech thing (since a lot of people nowadays are not used to that sort of dialect) but its really not that big of a deal and after a few minutes, it is not a such a big deal.<br /><br />Beautifully acted, masterfully shot, and experatly scored, Atonement is a movie going experience that should be seen by all, one that will follow you days after the final, haunting shot.</p></body></html>

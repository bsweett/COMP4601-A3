Great movie, we saw it 100+ times and we DON'T wanna go back! Wanna know why? Cause besides the fact that there were far more deaths on Titanic (more tragic), Leonardo DiCaprio wasn't in this and that there is one maybe two main characters you'll actually recognize in this one (I recognized Kurt Russell only), this movie was FAR BETTER in EVERY OTHER WAY.<br /><br />Who cares that Titanic had a better orchestra, we're here to see the action: People dying, surviving and overcoming tragic occurrences and once the boat starts to capsize, sink and fill with deathly water, the action truly never stops. If anything, it slows down, but NEVER stops, TRUST IN ME.<br /><br />The characters were pretty good. I won't say who died but I will say that I won't be surprised if someone who's watching with you (if you're not a movie loner) sheds a tear or starts to seriously ball before the very end.<br /><br />The people involved in this tiny tragedy were pretty expressive, especially the females. When Kurt Russell went back to stop the propeller fans that stood in the way of true freedom instead of his daughter's husband/boyfriend/fiancee, his daughter began to sulk. And when it took a while for him to come back (does he come back? Find out!) she broke down and I did too. I shed a small tear out my right eye as I felt half as bad as she did at the time. Very decent acting. Even the kid was just beneath brilliance!<br /><br />The ending was very sad but not without light. The actors and actresses put on a damn good show and the special effects were decent and aplenty.<br /><br />--Not Titanic 2.0 (Thank goodness)<br />--Good acting<br />--Music is kept in the background once the ship capsizes<br />--Action aplenty<br />--Special effects here and there and here again<br />--Characters meet their fears eye to eye and face them<br />--So worth your time<br />--Don't listen to the naysayers<br /><br />Cover Art: A- (Frightening but puts the movie into perspective, summing it up without really watching it first)<br />Inside Art: N/A<br />Characters: A<br />Dialogue: B-<br />Story: C+<br />Comedy Relief: D+<br />Music Score: D- (I hardly remember anything besides the lame music that played when everyone was fine and laughing...)<br />Length: A<br /><br />4.45 stars.<br /><br />Overall: A-</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Confusing But Engaging Mystery"></head><body><p>Leonardo DiCaprio plays Teddy Daniels, a federal marshal who is sent to the hospital for the criminally insane on Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a patient. It is 1954, and mental health treatment is still pretty primitive. But he and his partner, Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo), soon begin to suspect that the hospital is using the patients for horrible experiments. Then Teddy starts having some really horrible dreams.<br /><br />The audience does not really know what is true, what is imagined, what is Teddy's nightmare, or what is what. This would be decidedly unfair if we did not get to the bottom of it, and discover the truth, before the end of the film. But we do. And frankly, I for one did not see it coming. Which is a high compliment for a mystery story.<br /><br />It's quite an adventure, pretty bloody at times, and DiCaprio has almost no sex appeal in this one. Almost.</p></body></html>

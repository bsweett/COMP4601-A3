<meta name="summary" content="The Real World Of Penguins"></head><body><p>Cute and adorable, but this film opens a window to the real world of daily penguin life. That world can be filled with love and dedication, from seeing the hatching of an egg through to fruition, to the improper transfer of that egg from parent-to-parent, and its hasty demise in the bitterly freezing temperature of the Antarctic. Or the ability of parents to recognize their own young, amongst thousands of others simply by recognizing each others vocal cries. As good as documentaries get, this film rivals the best of National Geographic. Though it may bring your little ones to tears, as I witnessed in the theater. The English version of this French produced film, is fortunate to have the sensitive narration of Morgan Freeman. Now a permanent part of our family DVD collection.</p></body></html>

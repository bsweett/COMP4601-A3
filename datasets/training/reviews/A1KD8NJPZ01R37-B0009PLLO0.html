<meta name="summary" content="Jeezus, Angelina your so hot but your TERRIBLE lately"></head><body><p>I even like Colin too, but he's speaking in an IRISH accent the whole movie. Angelina's accent is Russian, and the movie is just one bad turn after another. It's almost unwatchable. A guy on the plane sitting next to me (with no sound) said it looked like a horrible movie just glancing at it.<br /><br />You want to watch it because you think it can't be THAT bad, it's a big budget production after all. Think again..<br /><br />The sad thing is we'll have to wait another 10-20 yrs for someone to remake Alexander the way it should be.</p></body></html>

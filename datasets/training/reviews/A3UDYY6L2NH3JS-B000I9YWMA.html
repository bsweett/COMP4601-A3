No one will ever know who he was and what his motivations were, except if one day we come across new documents. This film is adapted from a comic strip and the theory is original, even if it is not in any way more objective than any other. The idea is that it is a freemason cleaning mission to protect the Prince of Wales who is syphilitic but has married a young prostitute and has had a child from her. The scandal has to be erased and the unacceptable heiress to the throne has to be pushed aside, destroyed, along with all the witnesses of the illegitimate marriage, what's more in a catholic church. The freemasons are moved into this extreme action by several reasons. First to avenge the crime from the catholic church, hence to clean up the plate of dirty linen they have had with the catholic church for centuries. Second, to clean up the social plate this time and get rid of prostitutes, at least some of them, and maybe frighten prospective customers. Prostitutes are seen as propagating diseases and social decay. Third, to strengthen the Crown of England, the Empire, because they have won a very important position in this political institution that more than tolerates them. They also agree with the vast program of this Empire : to civilize the world. Fourth, and this motivation is very obscure, they go back to old traditions and rituals that are supposed to symbolically save the world because they are inspired by God himself, thus projecting the free masons into a cosmological and religious mission : to be the new Abraham, the new Moses, the new messengers of God on earth to propagate his will and ethics. The inspector that tries to find out the truth is a mixture of many characters, particularly Sherlock Holmes, including the use of opium (though Holmes used cocaine), to have visions of the crimes and the criminal. This gives an esoteric dimension to the story. Of course this does not stop the criminal, though the film does pretend the criminal is punished after fulfilling his mission because he over-interpreted the objective of it. The film is well built, entertaining and even thrilling. And I particularly like the use of grapes in this plot. It reveals the deep poverty of many, the condescending pity and rejection of these dregs of society that prostitutes are, the aristocratic belief that these women can be lured by some valueless vain merchandise, etc. The free masons are shown as being a sect, nothing but a sect that tries to manipulate society through their penetrating into the inner circles of the governing body of it. Power is their main objective and they are ready to do anything to protect this power, their power or the power that tolerates them. They are in other words extremely dangerous. This is the modern dimension of this film and it is a disquieting one, because free masons still exist.<p>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Unbalanced & Stereotypic"></head><body><p>No review, but a couple of doubts.<br />(1.) First, in the topically important subject of Father Flynn's conduct within his parish the audience should be presented with balanced arguments from both he and Sister Aloysius. Instead, we have a dominant/unbalanced presentation of the Sister's accusations over a weaker Father Flynn defense. That would be fine if the movie was entitled "Gossip". A more objective, albeit challenging movie would present the unfolding events as if to an omniscient audience and let us impartially decide guilt & innocence. In addition, the overindulgent & exaggerated acting only made it the more difficult to gleam the truth as to misconduct.<br />(2.) Second, the movie perpetuates the stereotype of misconduct within religious orders as being near rampant (shared blame with the media) even though the actual percentage of misconduct may be 0.01% and not statistically different than many other professions or categories of interest.</p></body></html>

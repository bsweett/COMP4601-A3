<meta name="summary" content="Slow start, but great ending"></head><body><p>I had never heard of this movie until it came out on HD DVD.  People were saying good things about it so I gave it a rent.  I was under the impression it was a comedy, but there are few funny moments in the first half.  In fact, the plot drags a bit and I was getting restless.  But momentum built and the ending of the movie was darn near hilarious.  The picture quality was excellent-especially for a combo disc and there's a lot of bass that gave my Buttkickers a good workout.  However, I have no desire to see it again so for me this one is just a rental.</p></body></html>

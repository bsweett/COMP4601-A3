The first movie was more artistic and so good at building up tension, and the second resolves everything, answers all the questions, reveals motivations and character. But maybe tying up loose ends is the way it's done in all the movies that Tarantino is parodying. Bill's reputation definitely preceeded and inflated him; he was even a bit boring - unusual for a Tarantino character. But this movie, like the first, is lots of fun amid murder and mayhem.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="If you lived the 80's...this is a great fun flick"></head><body><p>Its being a long long time that ive watched a movie and waiting till the last<br />end credits rolled by...why...because they picked the right music throughout the<br />film and did'nt slap you in the face with crappy music for the end credits like<br />most films have been doing for years.  Its good from the beginning to the end...and<br />also bring back great memories of the 80's crowd having fun, being colorfull in<br />the choice of clothes and atmosphere. Most situations are fun, and as a bonus we<br />have Chevy Chase making appearances here and there.<br />Had fun watching it...and will watch it again.</p></body></html>

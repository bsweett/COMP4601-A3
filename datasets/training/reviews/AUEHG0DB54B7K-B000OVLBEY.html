<meta name="summary" content="Johnny Blaze Rides!!"></head><body><p>When I first saw the previews of Ghost Rider it seemed that it would be a waste of time but as longtime fans of Nicholas Cage my wife and I decided to see the film.  To my surprise, I found Ghost Rider enjoyable and a lot of fun.  I have not read any of the comic books that the film is based upon but the story seems well put together and the performances are fairly good.  Nicholas Cage is a great choice to play Johnny Blaze and Eva Mendes is well cast as Roxanne but the part is one-dimensional and she does little more than react.  Wes Bentley plays a good villain as Blackheart but his role, also, does not have a lot of scope but Ghost Rider is an action film not one for character development.  It was good to see Sam Elliot (as a former Ghost Rider) and Peter Fonda (as Mephistopheles) again in a film.  An excellent performance was turned in by Matt Long as the young Johnny Blaze.<br /><br />Ghost Rider is an entertaining action film.  As an earlier review pointed out, Ghost Ride is not the comic book but a film based on the comic book so it may not meet everyone's expectations.  The performances may not be the greatest but neither is this a high drama that requires a wide emotional range.  The CGI effects are outstanding, and for Ghost Rider are just as important as the casting.  Ghost Rider is pure entertainment and a ride that I will take again.</p></body></html>

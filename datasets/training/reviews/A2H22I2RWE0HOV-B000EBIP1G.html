Much like The Hobbit and The Lord Of The Rings.  In fact, Rings author Tolkein and Lewis were friends.  Hmmm.  Drawing parallels.  Peter Jackson took The Lord Of The Rings and awed us and in effect raised the bar for anyone doing a classic series in the future.  Enter The Chronicles of Narnia.  Big budget.  Unknown star.  Walt Disney backing.  What could possibly go wrong.  The answer is nothing.  The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe is visually stunning.  Its epic.  It's envisions Lewis' tale to the fullest extent.  Sure, there are some minor violations of story as prescribed by the novel, and I sure that's going to freak out the purists and C.S. Lewis diehards, but...who cares.  I was always into Tolkein way, way more than the Narnia books.  If the film has any drawbacks it's that, having read the book, it's so exact as to be a bit boring in parts.  You already know what's going to happen.  The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe was always the most popular of the Narnia saga and it will be interesting to see what they make of the other, lesser-read, lesser-known Narnia books.  Overall...your kids will love this movie because it has everything.  Aldults who read the book may find it sort of tedious in places.  Otherwise, great effort and pure family entertainment.<br /><br />Dig it!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Amazing Adventure Stories"></head><body><p>After a long wait, this box set finally came out on DVD in October of 2003 and it looks great!  Now, the next step will be to see these fun movies on Blu-Ray!<br /><br />All three Indiana Jones stories were entertaining but the first one - Raiders Of The lost Ark - was still the best. Over 25 years later, it still has some very memorable scenes, like the opening one with the gigantic boulder chasing Harrison Ford to the ending scene with the Ark of the Convenant opened.<br /><br />Years from now, I wouldn't be surprised if this is still considered one of the great adventure films of all time.The action scenes are varied. You get fist fights, battles with snakes, with airplane propellers, guns, knives, poison dates, fires, supernatural plague-type winds, chases through city streets, caves, mountains....you name it, it's all in here.<br /><br />The next two Indiana films were almost as good, and certainly very entertaining. I've come to really appreciate "Temple Of Doom," which gets better with each viewing (especially the cinematography) and I always enjoy seeing Ford and Sean Connery together in "Last Crusade."</p></body></html>

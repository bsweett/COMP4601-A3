<meta name="summary" content="Futuristic plot from a past view, a unique movie, worth a watch"></head><body><p>An interesting film that came out a few years ago, sky captain and the world of tommorrow was a film I had wrote off as something that would be rediculous.  Now that i took the chance to watch it, I am actually suprised, It was kind of entertaining. This movie is based on the concept of what people may have thought future technologies would have looked like in the late 1930's .  It reminds me of a flash gordon tale, or of some of the old Superman cartoons.  Sky captain Joe and his former reporter girlfriend Polly find themselves in the middle of the doomsday plan, and they are the only ones that can stop it. Right from the begining, the effects and cinemetograph is unique, seeming similar to what was used in the recent King Kong movie of last winter.  The effects are what you would expect, many computer generated blue screen shots, but I enjoyed that many of the ships,planes and machines where thing that a kid might dream of, and seemed like a elaborate old comic book. Just cool. Take a look at this film, it may be a far fetched plot like flash gordon of that era, but take it in the text of fantasyt of a comic book, like superman, batman, the hulk etc, and I think you might enjoy it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I Love Rock n` Roll"></head><body><p>A good movie about rock, &quot;Almost Famous&quot; is also one of Cameron Crowe`s best efforts to date. Focusing the daily tribulations of fictional band Stillwater, this story intends to give a scoop into the backstage of the music world, focusing the band members` relationships, the contrived press connections, the groupies` appeal and the extremely difficuld career in the music business. Billy Crudup and Kate Hudson shine as the young, innocent and passionate teen couple who is discovering life through music and must face a new and complex world that forces them to make hard choices. &quot;Almost Famous&quot; is clearly a labour of love, since everyone seems to be enjoying what they`re doing, and the fact that some elements are based on Cameron Crowe`s experiences also helps. Enjoyable and bittersweet, offering strong acting, direction and music, this movie is a worthwile cinematic experience that doesn`t quite change the world but makes it look like a better place. <p>Above average.</p></body></html>

If you don't know the rest, and you like good solid action movies, then you need to buy this Five star collection.  Now before you blow this movie off as a mindless violent movie, let it be known that Die Hard was the action flick that changed everything.  Before this one, actions films usually had heroes who were all muscle and no emotion.  Bruce Willis comes off in this movie as an everyday guy.  Yes, he's a cop, and a smart cop, but it is his portrayal as a troubled husband and father with marriage problems that really hits home.  He's not perfect.  He's stubborn and unobjectionable, and that helps us relate.<br />Willis plays John McClane, a New York detective who travels to California to visit his wife at her company Christmas party.  She has moved out there to successfully pursue her career, an idea that an old school Irish cop such as himself is probably not used.  He comes from a family who is most likely holding to values that the wife should be taking care of the kids and not working for a multi-million dollar company.  McClane is not against her working, but he probably holds reservations about it.  They are separated, but it is obvious they miss each other, too.  In a turn of events a group of `terrorists' take control of the building where the party is taking place.  The lead terrorist is played by Alan Rickman, also changing the role of the villain for all time as well.  Rickman plays Hans Gruber, a smart, slick and highly intelligent criminal who does not gloat with evil laughter.  He is single minded and professional.  What happens afterward is a sharp game of cat and mouse as Gruber tries to figure out who this monkey wrench in the works is and McClane gathers information about the terrorists and tries to get help from the outside.  Interestingly, his first ideas are to get help, not take everyone on all by himself.  He constantly stays on his toes and the title of the movie becomes very apparent as McClane takes injury after injury but keeps going.  Add in some humor, some emotional conversations between McClane and a beat cop who he contacts outside the building, and some moments where the fear in Willis' character become very clear, and you get a movie that is so well rounded and entertaining, it's no wonder it's a classic.  Enough said, buy it.<br />By the way, I say it's a guys Christmas movie only because it takes place at Christmas time.</p></body></html>

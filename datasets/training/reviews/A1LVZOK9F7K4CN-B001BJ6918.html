Someday in the near future, I hope to own the Complete Kill Bill Special Edition DVD collection.  Or maybe Tarantino will edit the whole thing together into one movie as it was originally planned.  Anyway, both films can stand by themselves.  True, there isn't a fight sequence in this film as monumental as The Bride fighting all of the Crazy 88's, but her fight sequence with Darryl Hannah (entitled provocatively, "Elle and I") will leave a lasting impression.<p>In the first film, we were left to infer things without getting all the information.  We never even actually "saw" Bill.  However, we formed certain expectations about him.  This film succeeds in confounding those expectations.  David Carradine does a great acting job with his part.  The final sequence turns out to be surprisingly poignant.  Of course, there is great Tarantino dialogue here as well - I didn't think anyone would come up with anything fresh to say on the subject of Superman, but he does.  All in all, this is an incredibly fun ride.</p></body></html>

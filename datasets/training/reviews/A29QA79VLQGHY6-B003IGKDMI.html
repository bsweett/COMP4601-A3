<meta name="summary" content="Killer"></head><body><p>Brutal, stylish, hypnotic and addictive, "GoodFellas" remains Martin Scorsese's greatest film. Director Richard Linklater, a major fan, dismisses those who instead champion "Raging Bull." With "GoodFellas," he says in the DVD extras, "You are in the hands of a master. Enjoy the ride."<br /><br />"GoodFellas" anchors Warner's "Martin Scorsese Collection" of five films, including the gangster film's thematic predecessors "Mean Streets" and "Who's That Knocking at My Door?"<br /><br />The double-disc "GoodFellas" offers two worthy commentaries -- one with the actors and filmmakers; another with Henry Hill, the movie's real-life anti-hero, played with considerable verve by Ray Liotta.<br /><br />Hill shares the commentary with the lawman who turned him into a federal witness, but the semipenitent mobster does most of the talking. Hill is a great storyteller in the Italian street tradition -- it's fascinating watching the movie with him. The film "was all based on the rhythm of Henry Hill's language," Scorsese says.<br /><br />The cast-and-filmmaker talk includes almost all of the key talent, whose comments are carefully placed and tightly edited. Some chapters are automatically bypassed during the commentary.<br /><br />"GoodFellas" fans love to cite some of the film's jaw-dropping scenes: Scorsese and editor Thelma Schoonmaker dissect three of the best.<br /><br />Disc 2 includes a quartet of freshly minted featurettes, but most of the action is in the commentaries.<br /><br />Audio and video are superb, blowing away the previous Warner DVD, which dates back to the format's Stone Age. Aspect ratio is 1:85.1, as shot.</p></body></html>

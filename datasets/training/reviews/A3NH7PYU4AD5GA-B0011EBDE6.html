<meta name="summary" content="Lovely Rita, don't play with me aux Champs Elysees..."></head><body><p>Just so you don't think I write only negative film reviews, here is one that I liked. I can't say, honestly, what it is about, really, but it hits the right wave length most of the time. It is a part time screw ball comedy, but every now and then gets pulled into a serious situation.<br />As I don't quite understand it, I will give it only four stars, sort of a defensive measure.<br />What is it about? If you summarize that, it comes out as total nonsense. Three brothers go to India to look for their mother who has become a nun there, and they are mad with her because she didn't come to Dad's funeral a year ago. Well, I told you, it does sound like nonsense. One of the brothers has his face smashed up from a motorcycle accident, the other one just got ditched by his girl friend, while the third is looking to become a father in six weeks, though he expected to get a divorce, rather.<br />The ditched one is getting used by lovely Rita, who needs to ditch her own boyfriend.<br />But it is funny. Most of the time. Think of Lost in Translation in another country. Which is appropriate, as the Coppola family is somehow involved. And Bill M. is there, even if he misses the train.<br />And the music! (Where do you go to, my lovely? etc)</p></body></html>

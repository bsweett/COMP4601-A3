<meta name="summary" content="Wonderful movie"></head><body><p>At a solid 4.5/5 stars, Wolverine is one of the best movies of 2009 that I have seen.<br /><br />While this movie might not be entirely faithful to the comic book canon (what movie ever follows their printed version 100% anyway?) I enjoyed it immensely. It served as a great prequel to the trilogy of X-Men movies, and had a rather engaging story and plot. I do wish a bit more could have been given to the back story, but I gotta say, the sequence with the brothers moving from war to war (Civil through Vietnam) was pretty fricking sweet. I can't help but wonder what Victor was doing all these years aside fighting in wars and what made him the way he was, but overall the setup was pretty good.<br /><br />Some people might not like how this movie was done - I wasn't a big fan of all the changes, but again, it's just a movie (and a enjoyable one at that) Personally, I wasn't much for Deadpool, even his makeup was just... garish and overdone. But it makes for a fun prequel, with quite a few familiar faces (including a young and teen-aged Scott Summers) The visuals were impressive.<br /><br />If you really want to enjoy this movie, don't compare it to the comic books so you can nitpick. Just sit back and relax, and let the story and special effects take you away. Hugh Jackman is AWESOME in this movie, he makes a rocking (and very sexy!) Wolverine. I was also delighted to see the introduction of Gambit.</p></body></html>

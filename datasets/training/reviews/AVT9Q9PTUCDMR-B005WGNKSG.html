Well, author Stieg Larsson knew what he was doing when writing the book this movie is based on by doing that but this is no B movie. This is easily one of the best thrillers onscreen of all time.<br /><br />The story itself is mindblowing and will wipe out any lefty's preconceived notions that Sweden is or was ever a utopia of socialism (if you've ever been to a Swedish soccer match you know they have their own hooligan "minority," too, even in this so-called open and liberal welfare state). The movie itself is mainly a whodunit that is somehow able through flashbacks, creative editing and a powerful soundtrack to make computer hacking and archival research look exciting.<br />Yet there is plenty of violence (and very graphic so if you are squeamish this is your forewarning) and sex (brief in all cases but often cruel, bizarre and frigthening).<br /><br />The real reason you should see this movie is the lead actress, Noomi Rapace, who plays the bisexual punk (she's not Goth, movie critics!) computer hacker Lisbeth Salander. The woman is a revelation. She'll become every sane person's heroine after seeing her meting out real justice to the villains in the story.<br /><br />Throw in the stark Swedish landscape in winter and the juxtaposition of Stockholm with the village hinterland and its' also a hauntingly beautiful movie. The twists alone will blow your mind.<br /><br />Who would have thought a nation known in cinema history more for the glacially slow navel gazing "fillums" of Ingmar Bergman could decades later singlehandedly revive the thriller genre and make it fresh and new again?<br /><br />The extras feature a great 12-min. interview with Rapace on her taking on the role of Lisbeth. There's also a family tree of the Vanger Family in case you need that to follow who's who among the suspects in the murders.<br /><br />I am now full bore ahead looking forward to seeing the other two movies in this exciting trilogy. You will be, too, after you get over the emotional draining you'll go through watching this 1st installment.</p></body></html>

They usually tend to be summer blockbusters and because they make a lot of money and attract record crowds there must be need for them. Go figure.<br /><br />Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as divorce mediating wedding crashers whose chronic hobby is to womanize during women's most vulnerable hours (weddings) is the theme.  The first half hour of this overly long (two hour) movie traces them through many a varied wedding circumstance where they prevaricate their way into people's acceptance, the reward being to bed the most gullible females present.  Weddings have been used ad infinitum as theme parks for humor, some clever (Four Weddings and a Funeral) and others not.  This one falls into the latter category as it takes a premise to extremes then shifts focus in the last half hour in an attempt to redeem itself.<br /><br />There are some talented actors in the cast but few of them are given enough material to justify their inclusion.  Jane Seymour in a Mrs. Robinson role has moments, but Christopher Walken as a government bigwig falters.  A new face, Rachel McAdams, is welcome and acts as the only truly thought out character in the story.  But you have to be in the mood for some cruelty of language, some toilet humor, and a tolerance for over-extended ideas to make it through this one.  Grady Harp, January 06</p></body></html>

Predator" is an insult to fans & is about as scary as a kiddie-fart in Church, on a cold Sunday in January. The film is an unscary, videogame style mess that can't compare to any of the installments in either "Alien" or "Predator" films & comes in last place when ranking both series together (in all honesty, I tried to like this film, but, I just couldn't). What really pissed me off was, I had high hopes that this film would get the special type of treatment that could, possibly, revitalize both series. That ain't gonna happen.<br /><br />Its October 2004. A satelite (owned by a company thats led by Charles Bishop Weyland) has picked up a mysterious heat signature 2000 feet below the surface in the No Man's Land style section of the Antartica. Weyland forms a rag-tag expedition to check out whats exactly up there and what specifically is going on.<br /><br />The expediton is about to pay for this excursion with there very lives, as they find out that the heat sig. is a pyramid constructed by the Predator species hundreds to thousands of years earlier. Every hundred years the structure is used as a rite of passage hunting ground for young Predators (what the f*ck?!?). What are they hunting? Aliens. The team finds out that there actually bait and sacrificial sheep for the Aliens, with little hope of survival.<br /><br />With the popularity between both film series, not to mention the first official smackdown in the "Aliens vs. Predator" Dark Horse comic book series, & the engrossing video game of the same name, you would actually think "20th Century Fox" would grow a brain and give this project to someone who, at least had a clue, as to what they were directing. Unfortunately, Paul W. S. Anderson can't grow a brain or buy a clue and the result is like watching someone else play a video game. Badly. Anderson continues his career path on becoming the planets suckiest director (I don't think he could direct himself out of an asthma attack!).<br /><br />The characters are so cardboard a Domino's Pizza box could emote more emotion! Lance Henrikson is o.k. as Weyland, in a nice nod to "Aliens". Other then that, I could care less about anyone of the characters (Ellen Ripley isn't this film and she's missed. a lot).<br /><br />The special effects are what save the film somewhat. The battle at the end of the film was cool and "AVP" gets a small repeal in this respect, but not much. Both species have never looked better (but in the defense of the original films, once an Alien/Predator, always an Alien/Predator).<br /><br />The film isn't without its loopholes. The first one I noticed is - if the pyramid hunt is a rite of passage for the Predator then what the hell were the first two Predators (from "Predator" and "Predator 2") doing on Earth?! The other loophole is that the Alien incubation cycle is longer than 15 min. In "Alien" it was suspensefull, errie, and disgusting to watch the Alien go from chestburster to the full size, slimy creature. In "AVP" the Aliens are reduced to the screen version of Sea Monkeys! During some of the fight scenes between the Alien & Predators, some of the Predators metal weapons melt on contact from the Aliens acidic blood, yet, in some scenes there weapons come back unscathed.<br /><br />Worst of all, "AVP" is rated PG-13, taking the edge out of both creatures, and insuring mommies, who have wittwe boys under 13, that they won't wet their beds from having nightmares.<br /><br />Thats like Mike Tyson licking Holyfields ear instead munching on it!<br /><br />"Alien vs. Predator" is like the soccer mom version of "Alien" or "Predator".<br /><br />Its like a porn movie without the sex.</p></body></html>

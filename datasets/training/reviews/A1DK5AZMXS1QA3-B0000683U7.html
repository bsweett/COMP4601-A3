<meta name="summary" content="Colorized classic"></head><body><p>An unfortunate aspect of growing up in America is that the turnover in culture is so fast that many older classics are almost unknown to the modern generation.  This is especially so with old movies, which, outside of holiday fare like the Ten Commandments or The Sound of Music, do not make comebacks once a decade or so, unlike clothing fashions.  This is why so many young people have never seen an Alfred Hitchcock movie.  For the longest time, I was one of the ignorant masses, until my mother told me about this great movie-maker.  I picked this up at the local library and watched it, and was amazed.  This is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Part thriller, part romance, part suspense and part action, this movie presaged modern Hollywood fare such as The Fugitive, National Security, and Enemy of the State for example.  There is gunfights, chase scenes, set-ups, cliffhangers (literally), and of course the famous cover shot of Cary Grant getting chased by an airplane in an open field.  And like many modern action movies, this one has the climax right at the very end, followed immediately by a cut to the closing kiss of hero and heroine.<br /><br />This DVD restoration is great.  The film and audio quality is flawless.  The special effects are also top-notch and comparable to anything seen on network TV today.  And most importantly, a great storyline.  I highly recommend this movie.</p></body></html>

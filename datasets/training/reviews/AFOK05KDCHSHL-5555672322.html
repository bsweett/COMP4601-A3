It serves no other purpose. Whereas the first two movies established the basic premise (the villain in part 2 takes up where his/her predecessor left off in part 1), "Part III" doesn't advance the scenario at all, merely restages the same plot as before: Teens take a weekend trip into the woods and are targeted for destruction by the seemingly unstoppable Jason.<br /><br />The plot is negligible, the characters conform to stereotype, and the constant stream of violent murders seems even more senseless than before. In fact, the indiscriminate nature of Jason's victims allows consistency to fall by the wayside, thereby signalling the film's status as little more than a mindless thrill-machine, the victim of lazy scriptwork by Martin Kitrosser and Carol Watson. To be fair, however, it's doubtful that a radical change in the basic scenario would have been acceptable to contemporary audiences. In 1982, these simple thrills were more than enough to ring the box-office bell, and woe betide any producer who dared to mess with a winning formula!<br /><br />The best efforts of sophomore director Steve Miner (also responsible for FRIDAY THE 13th PART 2, 1981) are compromised by two important factors: First, the cast seems to have been chosen on the basis of looks rather than acting ability, and the only character with a halfway decent plot-thread (the overweight guy whose feeble pranks are a desperate attempt to ingratiate himself with his peers) meets a predictably 'ironic' end long before his genuine emotional distress can be allowed to detract from the orchestrated mayhem. And secondly, the requirements of 3-D photography - in particular, the attention paid to the point of convergence from shot to shot, in order to prevent eyestrain and headaches in the audience - has resulted in visual and dramatic compromises, slowing the movie's rhythm and sapping all vitality from the narrative (this was true of many other 3-D movies which opened the following year). Seen in 3-D, the extra dimension is a genuinely effective novelty which enhances the viewing experience tenfold, from the opening credits (which seem to shoot out of the screen with startling clarity) through to the extended finale when Jason's rampage literally spills into the audience's lap. Viewed flat, for all its bloody violence and exaggerated body count, the film is a lumbering, pointless rehash of the first two entries, with no identity of its own.<br /><br />Followed by FRIDAY THE 13th: THE FINAL CHAPTER (1984).</p></body></html>

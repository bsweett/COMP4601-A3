How the heck are they going to explain that one?  Sahara was a different film than I expected, however; I pictured these guys out there digging up this historical relic, but there's very little of an archaeological nature to what turned out to be a fast-paced, quick-witted thrill ride of an adventure.  The discovery of the ironclad ship sort of falls into the background as the story mixes in a deadly plague, a brutal African dictator, and a potential threat to life as we know it.  Don't expect things to get too serious, though, as "treasure hunters" Dirk Pitt (Matthew McConaughey) and his hilarious sidekick Al (Steve Zahn) basically laugh their way through an incredible series of dangerous escapes and reckless acts of heroism.  These guys could show MacGyver a trick or two.<br /><br />Dirk works for NUMA (National Underwater and Marine Agency), and he manages to talk his boss into giving him a couple of days to follow up on an important clue to his pet obsession; not surprisingly, most folks think he's crazy to argue that the lost Confederate ironclad The Texas somehow crossed the Atlantic and now rests beneath the sands of Africa.  Along the way, though, Dirk and Al get a little sidetracked by Dr. Eva Rojas (Penelope Cruz) and her cohort Dr. Hopper (Glynn Turman), doctors with the World Health Organization trying to find the source of a deadly, spreading infection.  That source lies in Mali, a country ravaged by fighting between the forces of General Kazim (Lennie James) and rebels opposing his dictatorial ways.  Dr. Rojas does indeed run into trouble, but the personal danger she faces is nothing compared to the dangers she and Dirk eventually discover out in the wastelands of the desert.  Dirk and Al are a two-man wrecking crew, single-handedly taking out whatever comes their way - armed soldiers, tanks, helicopters, you name it.  A lot of it is ridiculously over the top - yet all the more entertaining for that very reason - you'll be rolling your eyes, but you'll be laughing as you do so.<br /><br />Sahara is really an action comedy.  A Confederate ironclad ship buried beneath the Sahara (carrying oodles of gold coins, to boot) is far from the most improbable plot element on display here.  McConaughey and Zahn are great in their roles, though, and that is the real secret to this movie's success.  The wrong actor in the role of either Dirk or Al would have been disaster, as the fanciful story could never have stood on its own two legs without the support of the right actors.  I can't say I truly bought Penelope Cruz as a doctor, but she more than held her own when it came to playing hardball with the big boys.  Of course, it helps when the bad guys are the worst shots in the world; it's actually rather ridiculous, as these guys almost surely broke the world's record for most missed shots in one movie.<br /><br />It's pretty simple, really - if you like action comedies, you should enjoy Sahara.  The comedic banter between the actors is consistently funny, there are plenty of action scenes chock full of gunfights, explosions, and fisticuffs, and you won't find any dull moments once things really get going.</p></body></html>

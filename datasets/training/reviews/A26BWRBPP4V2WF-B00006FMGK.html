<meta name="summary" content="Very skillfully made, but the series is out of gas"></head><body><p>There is a lot of merit to Star Trek: Nemesis.  As a fan of the original show, I always approached TNG films with skepticism.  First Contact was, of course, the pinnacle of this series, and I (unlike many ST fans) really enjoyed ST:Generations.  Insurrection was a definite turn for the worse, and I expected little of Nemesis.  Thus, I was pleasantly surprised to have enjoyed the film, in spite of its many shortcomings.  It's certainly better than Insurrection, for example. <p>The good points: it's pacing and action are fantastic.  Director Baird is a respected action film editor, and the pacing and feel of the film is pitch-perfect.  The performances in TNG have always been uneven - Frakes and Sirtis, for example, cannot match the presence of Patrick Stewart - but the acting is uniformly equal to or better than any of the previous TNG outings.  There are Romulans - everyone loves the Romulans!  Finally, in spite of what others have written, the highlight of the film is the crewmember's death (I won't say whose, in case you haven't seen it) - it is startling in its speed and very effective due to the quick cutting.  The denouement following the death is short, but every bit as effective as Spock's in TWOK.<p>Unfortunately, there are a number of bad points.  As pointed out by others, the story itself is essentially recycled from The Wrath of Khan, and that makes it feel tired and dull.  Worse still, there are logical holes - where does Shinzon find this B-4 prototype of Data? how did the Romulans get Picard's DNA?  what has happened to the Federation head spy to Romulus (Mr. Spock)? why doesn't Troy sense Shinzon's lies? (there is an explanation in the cut scenes, but the actual movie ignores the issue.)  Even more annoying are the glaring and unecessary scientific errors.  I don't mind when Star Trek invents science to explain itself (transporters, shields, etc.), but I really mind it when they make scientific errors for no reason.  The explanation of the Reman weapon is particularly laughable - no electromagnetic radiation could have the properties ascribed to it, it's a physical impossibility.  Likewise, you don't need an android to generate positronic radiation - any idiot with a nuclear reactor (or a particle accelerator) can do that.  And don't get me started on the aftermath of the collision between the Enterprise and the Scimitar!  Newton is rolling in his grave.  The point is, all of these mistakes were unnecessary - B-4's planet was proto-industrial, so positronic radiation would be anomalous anyways; Data's spacewalk could still have been necessary if the two ships were still attached; and there's no reason the Reman weapon had to be &quot;electromagnetic&quot; - it could have been any kind of energy!<p>The average moviegoer is likely to forgive the defects in physics, but less likely to forgive the plot holes.  However, most of these you don't notice while watching the first time, because you're caught up in the action.  It's on reflection afterwards that such thorny issues appear.<p>This DVD is crammed full of extras, and I wonder how they all fit on one disc!  There are some little minidocumentaries that are fun and interesting, cut scenes, etc.  The director's commentary is somewhat dull, but there's some interesting info in there.  All this is stuffed on without (apparently) sacrificing the quality of the feature - it is clean, crisp, and sounds great.</p></body></html>

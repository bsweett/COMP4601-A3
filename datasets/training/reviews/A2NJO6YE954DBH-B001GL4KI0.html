<meta name="summary" content="A couple of decent fight gags are not enough to rescue this film"></head><body><p>Early on in "Ultraviolet" there is a section of exposition that goes on and on, and I knew right then and there that this 2006 film written and directed by Kurt Wimmer ("Equilibrium"), was in big trouble. When you get to the point where you feel you need to be taking notes, it is just not a good sign. Not that the situation is all that confusing, to wit: in the future the human race is divided into normal humans and the Hemophages, who have a blood disease that makes them like vampires. Actually, it is more like they are called vampires, but if you are looking for this to matter in some significant way you will be disappointed. Incisors grow a bit longer and Violet Song ja Shariff (Milla Jovovich) comes back from the dead without exactly rising from the grave, and that is about it.<br /><br />Violet is sent off by her side to destroy a secret weapon which is in a case that she is repeatedly and emphatically told not to open, thereby guaranteeing that she will open it, not destroy it, and put herself in the middle of everything so that everybody will want to see her dead. Vicecardinum Ferdinand Daxus (Nick Chinlund) is the main villain, which means that when he and Violet finally get around to fighting with flaming swords we are just about at the end of the film. In between she basically kills everybody who tries to stop her from whatever she happens to be doing. Most of the action is decidedly uninspiring, but there are a few quick bits that will shake you from you lethargy and give you a brief moment of hope that things are looking up for this film.<br /><br />In terms of what category "Ultraviolet" ends up in, I would say that is definitely more of a comic book movie than a computer game movie. At first I thought it was obviously trying to be the latter, but there are just way too many shots and scenes that are clearly in keeping with the comic book approach to seeing the universe. Besides, the fight sequences with Violet usually tend to be quick and to the point, which is not the point of dispatching people in most computer games. If anything the violence is in keeping with Asian cinema. . The one thing I am sure of is that this film does not come close to taking from the best of any of these schools of influence. It has been a long time since I have been so easily bored by a science fiction film. Before Wimmer indulged in computer animated overkill, he should have come up with a much better plot to justify the time and the expense.</p></body></html>

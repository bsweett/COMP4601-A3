Along comes the Michael Mann-produced thriller, The Kingdom that attempts to fuse the action film with a dose of political intrigue while asking the age-old question, why are we over there? With Mann as producer and Peter Berg directing, it's a pretty safe bet that this film won't be a complicated expose of the United States government's foreign policy a la <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F7CMRM">Syriana (Widescreen Edition)</a> but closer to a kinetic thrill-ride in the vein of Ridley Scott's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008YLV2">Black Hawk Down (3-Disc Deluxe Edition)</a>.<br /><br />The Kingdom illustrates the point that we are losing the war in the Middle East like we lost the one in Vietnam because it is impossible to tell who the enemy are and who are our allies. At times, this film feels like a recruitment film for the FBI. Do yourself a favour and check out Syriana, which takes a much more complex, thought-provoking look at our dependence on Middle Eastern oil and why we are stuck in such a tricky political quagmire.<br /><br />There are 11 minutes of deleted scenes that aren't put in any context and lumped together. They do flesh out some of the relationships between characters but were probably cut for reasons of timing and pacing.<br /><br />"Character by Character: The Apartment Shootout" allows you to see this action sequence from the point-of-view of each of the main characters which is kind of a nice touch.<br /><br />"Constructing the Freeway Sequence" takes us through how they planned out and then shot this scene. As you would imagine, a lot of work when into coordinating everything and making sure that it was pulled off successfully.<br /><br />"The Making of The Kingdom" is a 35-minute, eight-part making of featurette. We get to see Berg and Mann talk about the genesis of the film. We see how the cast and crew prepared for the film, like learning to make bombs and how to fire guns. This is a pretty detailed look at many aspects of the production and offers some insight into how a film of this scale is put together.<br /><br />"History of The Kingdom: An Interactive Timeline" is basically breaking down the timeline we see in the opening credits into a slideshow format. However, there is very little additional information which is a disappointment.<br /><br />Finally, there is an audio commentary by director Peter Berg. He actually visited a U.S. compound, like the one depicted in the film, in Saudi Arabia. He says that they wanted to create realistic, visceral action sequences and actually had to tone down the carnage of the terrorist attack that opens the film. He also addresses the criticism leveled at him that he relies too much on hand-held camera shots. All in all, this is a fairly decent track.</p></body></html>

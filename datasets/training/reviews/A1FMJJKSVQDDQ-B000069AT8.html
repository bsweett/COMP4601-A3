Everyone in the family will always enjoy it. Now with that being said, I, like most people, have issues with this new edition of E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial. First off, the new CGI look for the alien himself is just plain silly. He looks way more unrealistic that he does in the original version. He looks too much like Jar-Jar Binks and Dobby (from Harry Potter). And then, there are the "edits" that have been made. You probably know what's wrong here: replacing weapons with talkie-talkies, replacing the word "terrorist" with "hippie," editing out the word "[...]," etc. Why couldn't they just leave this film alone and leave it the way it is? The great original is the one that should be watched, not the new 2002 version where it is dominated by political correctness. The 2-Disc Limited Collector's Edition is no longer in stock, so you'll have to find used DVD's. Why? Because it's the only edition that has the original 1982 version. So find one here, or on Ebay, or wherever you can find it, and skip the new 2002 version.<br /><br />E.T. 1982: A<br />E.T. 2002: F</p></body></html>

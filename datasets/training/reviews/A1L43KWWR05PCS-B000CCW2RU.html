<meta name="summary" content="INTRIGUING SCI-FI THRILLER..."></head><body><p>This film gets off to an interesting and edgy start. The time is the not-so-distant future. The location is a strangely antiseptic and sterile world,  where humanity supposedly lives in a  protected, artificial environment. Men and woman are segregated in separate housing. They  work at assigned tasks, wear the clothes they are given to wear, eat what they are told to eat, and every move they make is controlled and choreographed by an unseen force. Presiding over their supposed well-being is Merrick (Sean Bean).<br /><br />This multitude of beings believe that they are where they are due to a contamination of the Earth's environment. There is, however, a place on Earth to which they all aspire to go: the island, a utopian paradise, free from the contamination that purportedly covers most of Earth. The only way to get to the island is via a lottery. The ostensibly lucky winner is told to pack his or her bags and is then whisked away, never again to be seen.<br /><br />This is the world of Lincoln Six Echo  (Ewan McGregor) and Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson). They, too, wait for the day when they will win the lottery. There is, however,  something about Lincoln Six Echo that does not quite conform to what passes for the norm in this controlled environment. Consequently, he comes under the scrutiny of Merrick, who is really sort of a futuristic Dr. Mengele. Lincoln Six Echo's problem is his curiosity, which leads him on a voyage of discovery. What he discovers is shocking. So, when his best friend, Jordan Two Delta, wins the lottery and is scheduled to be transported to the island, he goes into action mode.<br /><br />It is no secret that this film is about clones and the harvesting of their body parts for well-heeled clients who keep the clones as a back-up in case something goes wrong with their own bodies. The movie starts off quite promisingly, with its cutting edge plot, which provides much food for thought, and the faintly creepy, highly stylized, futuristic world that they inhabit. The film, however,  begins its downward spiral the minute it goes into action mode. In fact, in one of the featurettes, the director, Michael Bay, basically says that at some point he told his special effects people just to load up the film with action scenes and he would work around it.  Consequently, the plot takes a turn for the totally ridiculous. The film also has a final twist that is just simply not believable. It is unfortunate that this director has not yet realized that less is sometimes more.<br /><br />Wonderful performances are given by the entire cast, with special kudos to Ewan McGregor who effectively plays a dual role (Lincoln Six Echo and Tom Lincoln). Scarlett Johansson brings a fresh faced naivete to her role as<br />Jordan Two Delta. Steve Buscemi plays McCord, a creepy little guy that Buscemi makes strangely disarming and likable. Sean Bean is coolly sinister as Merrick, the futuristic Dr. Mengele prototype. Dimon Hounsou is well-cast as Albert Laurent, the security expert hired to take care of the developing situation by any means necessary. Michael Clark Duncan gives an  especially poignant performance as Starkweather, one of the lottery winners, as does Ethan Phillips in the role of Jones Three Echo.<br /><br />Despite the film's intriguing premise, it ultimately fails in its execution. The director succumbs to a need for excess, leaving the intelligent storyline in the wake of a deep rooted need for excessive and unbelievable action scenes and a twist that no one with an ounce of brains would believe. It is too bad, as the director had all the ingredients for a gourmet feast, but, instead, chose to serve the viewer the equivalent of a fast food burger. Still, sci-fi junkies will find a modicum of enjoyment in this well-acted film, as will those who enjoy aggressive action sequences in their films.</p></body></html>

The Best of the Trilogy and The Best Superhero Movie"></head><body><p>The legendary arachnid superhero is back in his 3rd masterpiece as he takes on Venom, the Sandman and Harry the new Goblin and battles internal conflicts. The Best Spidey yet and the best Superhero yet, don't let anyone stop ya from seeing this thrilling and emotionally powerful masterpiece, those people are parasites, go and see for yourself. Venom is the best villian of the 3 movies and in the comics, Sandman and Harry are great too, don't take that Marvel superhero crap that the 3rd X-Men is terrible or any other 3rd Marvel movie. I thought X-Men: the Last Stand was the best of those. Go see Spider-Man 3 and see that's the crowning achievement of superhero movies.</p></body></html>

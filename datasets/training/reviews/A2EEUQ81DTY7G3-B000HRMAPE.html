With lots of explosions and action sequences that look as though they have been almost edited out of existence, this third film in the franchise takes us to some exotic locales - Rome, Shanghai and Berlin, but it doesn't really offer up anything new or fresh.<br /><br />Ethan Hunt (Cruise) is about to get married when he's sent on a secret mission which secretly re-assembles old team, now comprised of Ving Rhames, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and luscious but wooden supermodel Maggie Q. They all head out to capture evil international bad guy, arms dealer Owen Davian (Philip Seymour Hoffman) who is after something called the Rabbit's Foot (much to our frustration we never actually find out what the Rabbit's Foot is).<br /><br />Fine actors Billy Crudup and Laurence Fishburne take small roles as bureau leaders. And Michelle Monaghan ends up kicking some b*tt as Ethan's lovely wife Julia. Obviously director J.J. Abrams is doing what he does best, bombarding us with extremely loud explosions, bulging rock music, prolonged gunfights, a series of chases of different varieties, jump-cut editing that's more like a teenage MTV video, and a convoluted plot that eventually leads nowhere.<br /><br />This installment is certainly fused with a dark and furtive quality: there's torture scenes, unstable devices shot up nasal cavities into people's brains, ruined buildings, and women in danger. When there aren't explosions, there's lots of Tom running, and tumbling etc. The narrative makes no sense and Ethan's romantic entanglements do nothing to lend the movie any emotional gravitas, still the action sequences, when they're not shot in the dark, are at least well done and have an edgy, exciting quality about them.

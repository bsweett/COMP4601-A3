<meta name="summary" content="Certainty does not necessarily equal proof"></head><body><p>Sister Aloysius is the dragon lady principal, the no-nonsense taskmaster, and the moral absolutist of the Catholic school in this film.  She terrifies the students and maintains strict order even at meals with the other sisters.  Then, through a series of misunderstandings, misperceptions, and suspicions, she starts to have doubts about the behavior of Father Flynn, who has befriended the only black child in the school and has tried to defend him from the other kids.<br />Without revealing the specifics, I'll just say that Sister A. goes on a mission to destroy Flynn's career and record because she believes fervently that her own suspicions are somehow proof of wrongdoing on his part.  Her manipulation of Sister James, whom she pressures, adds to the amount of damage she tries to inflict.<br />  By the end, you will see how important it is to give others the benefit of the doubt when you truly do not have all the facts or even any evidence at all.  By the time that lesson is learned, however, it might be too late for some of the parties involved.<br />  At first I wasn't sure if Hoffman was up to the task of playing a priest, but he was in fine tune.  Streep was fascinating and frightening to watch, while Amy Adams gave a nicely nuanced performance as Sister James.</p></body></html>

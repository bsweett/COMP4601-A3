<meta name="summary" content="What if they made a war movie... and nobody fought?"></head><body><p>Or, at least, nobody fought in a conventional sense.<br /><br />Even in anti-war war movies (which is most of them) we're used to getting the big battle scenes, a signature glimpse of the horror that, however eye-popping or momentarily thrilling, will eventually become repellent.<br /><br />"Saving Private Ryan" has its whiplash, surround sound depiction of D-Day.<br /><br />"Full Metal Jacket" has its more-grueling-than-battle boot camp sequence, and its hunt for a sniper in the ruins of Hue City.<br /><br />"Apocalypse Now" has helicopter attacks more beautifully choreographed than ballet.<br /><br />But the new movie about America's first war with Iraq, "Jarhead," is built around the "hurry-up-and-wait" rhythms of combat in a technological age.<br /><br />It's about the forces who stood on their mark in the desert for months - from the invasion of Kuwait in Aug. 1990 to the start of hostilities in Jan. 1991 - to take part in a war that, in the end, lasted just four days and was fought mostly with planes, tanks and remote controls.<br /><br />We see it through the eyes of Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal), a smart-but-naive California kid who joins the Marines and soon realizes he's in over his head. His basic training is gone in a blink (probably to avoid further resemblance to "Full Metal Jacket") and almost immediately, he finds himself serving as a sniper in the Persian Gulf, waiting for Operation Desert Shield to become Desert Storm.<br /><br />In the meantime, he and his comrades are gung-ho, expertly trained, fairly well-equipped, coiled to strike ... and also scared, bored, lonely, frustrated and uninformed. That's a volatile cocktail.<br /><br />The result, as directed by Sam Mendes, will probably divide audiences, especially those hoping for combat scenes (a surplus of which will undoubtedly appear in the movies that spring from the second war with Iraq).<br /><br />This film, however, is slowly, episodically paced; its satire isn't always focused and there's a haziness with some details (did Marines really dig foxholes directly under drizzling torrents of oil?) that left me eager to read Swofford's book.<br /><br />But the movie is usually engaging and occasionally chilling; it gets solid performances out of Jamie Foxx and Peter Sarsgaard, who play career Marines; and its final scene, a montage set against Tom Waits' song, "Soldier's Things," may be a bit too on the nose but it still got me.<br /><br />Ultimately, though, "Jarhead" just isn't the four- or five-star home run it could have been. Though it tries, it doesn't achieve the gritty satirical edge of, for example, David O. Russell's "Three Kings" (which made a statement about the Gulf War *and* told a nifty heist story *and* de-glamorized combat violence). Like its hero, this is a movie that's angry and bound up and takes careful aim ... but never really shoots to kill.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Beautiful Film... For people who read"></head><body><p>I really loved this story, while my beautiful unromantic wife was bored to death. The plot is slow and methodical, just like some very good books. My only grief with the story was the part that was obvious too soon. Other than that, I felt it was a fulfilling movie well worth the watching. While, we have become used to romance genre films being more or less comedic, this one is not, or tragic, like "Somewhere in Time", the logical comparison film, "Lake House" is not that either, it is a melancholy story were the end is happy.<br />This is a story that requires you to both suspend disbelief and think. That might not be good for everyone... But, it was for me.</p></body></html>

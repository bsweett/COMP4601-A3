<meta name="summary" content="it'll be  classic, I think"></head><body><p>So these two american guys are walking around england, on vacation. And they come to this creepy little town out in the middle of the misty moors. And ... they don't stay the night; instead they choose to push on, despite the rain and general nastyness and their being on foot. Which, given the general attitude of the townsfolk, seems perfectly reasonable. <p>Anyways, I'd never seen it, I'd never heard anything about it when I watched it. It's funny and gross and silly, and I love the music. (Is there a soundtrack? "I seeeee a baa-aad moon risin'...") I recommend it to werewolf & horror fans everywhere.</p></body></html>

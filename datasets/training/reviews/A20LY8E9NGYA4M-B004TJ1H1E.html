<meta name="summary" content="MARILYN MONROE, JACK LEMMON AND TONY CURTIS AT THEIR BEST."></head><body><p>&quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; is considered by many people the best comedy of all time. Depending on what kind of comedy you prefer, that asseveration may or may not be true, but is undeniable that this movie is a high quality comedy that must be seen by any movie fan.<br /><br /> Starred by Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon and the gorgeous Marilyn Monroe. Arguably, the three of them bring their best performance of their careers. Each one of them in this movie uses a different comedy style, and with very effective results. Jack Lemmon as a frenetic and desperate Jerry / Daphne, Tony Curtis as a cool, calm and conquering Joe / Josephine, and Marilyn Monroe, in her best performance ever, as the sexy and tender Sugar Kane.<br /><br /> &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; is packed of hilarious situations, and clever and humorous dialogues. Despite the fact that the film was released almost 45 years ago, still manages to be a very effective and funny comedy, without a doubt &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; is one of the most representative movies of the comedy genre. Indispensable.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="SCARY!"></head><body><p>I am not a big horror fan, but every now and again my<br />family talks me into watching one, such was the case with<br />this movie.  Talk about being scared, I barely took my eyes<br />off the screen even though my mind was telling me to.<br />  The setting of the movie was mostly in rural areas with<br />very few people around, that only added to the fear factor.<br />I believe the worse part was when the police were pulled out<br />of their car by this evil demon! I thought I had swallowed<br />my heart! If you are looking for a movie that will make you sit<br />on the edge of your seat, this is the one for you. I only wish<br />that it had ended a little different, but again I am into happy<br />endings and that does not very often happen with a chiller like<br />this!</p></body></html>

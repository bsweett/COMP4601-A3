<meta name="summary" content="Great movie!"></head><body><p>This is a great film. It is probably my favorite HP movie. The acting is getting better and better with each film, especially from the younger actors. The scenery is wonderful and the plot pretty fun, though they did take some liberties from the book, though it doesnt deter it in any way. In fact, I found the changes did not affect the actual story whatsoever, and am glad for it.</p></body></html>

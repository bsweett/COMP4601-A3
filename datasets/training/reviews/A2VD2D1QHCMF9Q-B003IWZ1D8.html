<meta name="summary" content="Still Scares!"></head><body><p>I saw this movie over 40 years ago, when it first came out, and I remember the screams in the theater.  Although the filming techniques and the dialogue and some of the acting shows its age, the film is no less exciting to watch than when I orignially saw it.  The logic in the development of Norman into what he became is perfectly credible, whether or not there are people who have actually gone "psycho" off the movie screen.  Every time I see the movie I see at least one more thing that I didn't notice before, and I am still shocked at the "mother's" appearance and actions.  It still scares.</p></body></html>

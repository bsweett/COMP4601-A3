<meta name="summary" content="Fixer versus Fixer"></head><body><p>2007's "Michael Clayton" is a tense and fascinating, if slowrolling, legal drama featuring George Clooney as the resident "fixer" at a high-speed legal firm, whose job it is to clean up the messes of the firm's clients.<br /><br />As the movie opens, we meet Michael Clayton, a burnt-out New York attorney with a gambling problem, divorced, and in financial straits over a failed restaurant.  Clayton is summoned by phone to fix yet another client's legal mess.  In a tense confrontation with a client fresh from a hit-and-run accident, we get a feel for Clayton. He is cynical, practical, and good at "fixing" problems, but ground-down by the sordid nature of the work. On his way back to the city, he happens to leave his car just before it is destroyed by an explosion.<br /><br />The movie now steps back four days in time. Clayton's best friend Arthur, a senior litigator in the law firm and defending pesticide giant U/NORTHERN against a three billion dollar class-action suit, suffers a psycological melt-down during a deposition.  Clayton is dispatched by the law firm's senior partner (played with weary cynicism by Sydney Pollack) to "contain" the damage. Arthur (played with wonderfully manic energy by Tom Wilkinson) has had both a breakdown and an epiphany about the nature of the class action law suit.  Clayton tries unsuccessfully to get Arthur safely back on his depression medication and back on the rails with their law firm.<br /><br />U/NORTHERN's general counsel (a roller-coaster emotional performance by Tilda Swinton) is also playing damage control.  With her position with U/NORTHERN hanging on the successful resolution of the lawsuit, she is driven to desperate measures.  She engages a shadowy pair of operators who tail and wiretap Arthur, now back in New York and preparing to change sides in the class action suit.  Aware that Arthur has evidence of a U/NORTHERN cover-up, she authorizes the operatives to take "the other option."<br /><br />Michael Clayton is stunned to learn of Arthur's apparent suicide.  U/NORTHERN's legal problems seem resolved by Arthur's rather timely death, and the law firm loans Clayton the money to buy his way out of his financial difficulties.  However, a chance encounter with one of the plaintiffs in the law suit causes Clayton to question Arthur's death and the resoluion of the law suit.  His investigation draws the lethal attention of the operatives working for U/NORTHERN.<br /><br />As the movie circles back to the beginning sequence, Clayton flees the scene of his destroyed car, ultimately to a confrontation with the U/NORTHERN general counsel that is the pay-off scene of the movie.  The ending of the movie should be emotionally satisfying for the viewer, if a little simplistic for the multi-layered drama that preceded it.<br /><br />"Michael Clayton" features atmospheric shooting in the city streets, law offices, bars, and suburbs of New York City.  The drama unfolds slowly but relentlessly, managing to create terrific tension without many "action" sequences.  George Clooney's low-key but pitch-perfect performance is backing by a rich supporting cast, including Michael O'Keefe as the senior partner's cellphone-toting assistant and Ken Howard as the head of U/NORTHERN.  A complex side-story involving Clayton's family adds depth to his decision-making after Arthur's death.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as a very entertaining legal drama featuring some excellent acting by George Clooney.</p></body></html>

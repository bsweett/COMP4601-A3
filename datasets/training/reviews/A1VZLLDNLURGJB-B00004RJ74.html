<meta name="summary" content="From Dusk Till Dawn - Great special effects but too much of a good thing!"></head><body><p>From Dusk Till Dawn (Dimension Collector's Series) - I saw Dusk Till Dawn with my wife and boys and knew I had made an error taking them to see it as this was not a film for kids. I should have watched it alone. I knew nothing about it until my boys asked to go see it and I wouldn't recommend it for really young audiences.<br /><br />It was chock a block full of dark murderous themes, and excellent special effects but I think it provided almost too many effects. I consider it a good film which was entertaining almost until the ending.  I just question the need for the exceptional magnitude of explicit screen violence.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It's Sweet Nature Saves It......"></head><body><p>I was all set to dislike this film.  I skipped the last Rocky installment, the last one I saw being when he fought the big Russian in Rocky does Glasnost.<br /><br />However, Stallone imbues his aging South Philly boxer with such a sweet nature, weathered by his boxing years and now grieving for his departed Adrian, living a humble life in the old neighborhood, proprietor of a modest but decent family restaurant, obviously still beloved despite the fact that his championship glory days nonetheless inevitably are fading, that I was reminded why a huge audience was captivated by this character o-so-many years ago.<br /><br />And so Stallone hooked me in for one final inspirational saga of an aging champ trying to find meaning for his life, at the same time trying to convey a message of passion and courage to his own son and a young single mother and her son.  Of course it's incredible, but realism was never the attraction of Rocky movies.  It's always been about the inspiration and the yearning.<br /><br />So if you're beyond being touched by a sentimental flick about an iconic American character, give this a pass.  Stallone was wise not to make his opponent a villainous "bad" guy.  And that is indicative of the movie as a whole: Stallone displays maturity in both his story, himself, and his character.  He's aged gracefully, and so has Rocky, and both have their hearts in the right place in this one.  Nicely done.</p></body></html>

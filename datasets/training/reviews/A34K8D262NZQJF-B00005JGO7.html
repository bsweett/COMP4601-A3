It contains thieves, boxing promoters, pawn shop owners, trailer park trash, bookies, and the mafia all doing their own business when a small object of desire will bring them all together into one fusion of death, fire, and fury! If you like Lock, Stock than you should see this one cause you will like it just as much. About time you can understand what Brad Pitt is saying with the 'Pikey' option so only when he talks on the film a yellow caption in the bottom tells you every single word he is saying except the time when he explains to the boxing promoter what he exactly wants in his new trailer if he wins a big up and coming bet! Good movie!</p></body></html>

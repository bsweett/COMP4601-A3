<meta name="summary" content="An Oft-Told Tale But Good Entertainment"></head><body><p>THE SENTINEL will not create any new ideas for movie plots for the viewer, but it is filled with some fine actors who manage to keep the pace of this rather predictable 'inside the White House' story of intrigue moving for all of its 108 minutes.<br /><br />The story revolves around the protection of the President of the US (David Rasche) from an assassination plot, a plot that is so tight that it appears to come from within the Security System of the White House.  Pete Garrison (Michael Douglas) is a veteran member of the White House Security but has some problems: his ex-partner David (Kiefer Sutherland), convinced that Pete slept with his wife, is suspicious of Pete; Pete is having an affair with the President's wife (Kim Bassinger); Pete is pulled into dangerous territory trying to cover his secret and use a reliable old informer (Raynor Scheine) to give him clues; a new officer appears on the scene to accompany David and is a friend, Jill (Eva Longoria).  Once the evidence points to Pete as the planner of the assassination he is the victim of a chase, a chase that eventually uncovers the true insider perpetrator of the plot.<br /><br />The action is well paced and the actors make their roles as credible as possible.  One of the best parts of the film is the musical score by the very talented Christophe Beck who finally gets to demonstrate his skills as an orchestrator.  The fault of the film lies in the seemingly ignored fact that when well known actors are placed in a suspense movie and given very little to do except in the beginning, then the fact that they are in the cast points a big finger that they are going to be the true culprit - and that is very much the case here.  But for an evening's diversion the film provides some fine action work and the storyline is tense enough to hold your interest.  Grady Harp, September 06</p></body></html>

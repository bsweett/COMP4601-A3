<meta name="summary" content="Cute Story with a Couple of Flaws"></head><body><p>I was a little apprehensive about watching a movie about a rat who likes to cook.  However, two things got me interested in it.  The first was the director, Brad Bird, who wrote, directed, voiced, and probably did make-up for "The Incredibles"... what I believe is one of the greatest animations of all time.  What clenched it for me was a review by somebody who's opinion I trust.<br /><br />First, we were treated by the usual Pixar short animation before the movie.  Oh, how I love these.  They are cute, short, hilarious, and often unpredictable.  The one preceding this movie was no exception.<br /><br />We were then treated to the movie.<br /><br />You first get to know Remy (the rat that everybody sees in the advertising) and his family.  He isn't happy with his life because he does not get to do the one thing that he wants to do the most... cook.  But when his rat colony needs to move suddenly he loses contact with his loved ones but finds himself in Paris and meets Linguini, an employee at a restaurant who couldn't properly make a batch of ice if requested.  The problem with being a rat is that you aren't openly welcomed in anybody's kitchen.  However, after a series of interesting events, Remy and Linguini team up to become the cooking sensation of Paris.<br /><br />Hilarity ensues.<br /><br />The story is good and it works.  I like the message, which is basically to not judge a book by its cover.  The characters grow and we end up really interested on how everybody turns out.  Like other Pixar movies, it had everything you could wish for in a movie.  If you like other Pixar movies, there is little reason to not pick this movie up.<br /><br />So why only four stars?  Three reasons.<br /><br />The first is my OCD rearing its head.... there was a freaking RAT in the KITCHEN touching all the FOOD!!!  Sorry, I just could not get over that.  I'd probably be more accepting of a cat, dog, or otter... but a rat?  One of the most diseased animals ever?  Did the writers ever hear of a little event knows as the GREAT PLAGUE??!?!  But, that is just me.  I know, I know... he washes his hands, but still.<br /><br />The second is the mechanism that Remy and Linguini come up with so they could cook together.  This was more unbelievable than talking and cooking mice.  I guess it would have been more difficult to come up with something else but with Brad Bird's genius I think he just came up with something easy instead of clever.<br /><br />Lastly, this was in Paris.  There should have been a LOT more France jokes.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Treat For The Eyes & Ears"></head><body><p>Special-effects and terrific 5.1 surround sound are the highlights of this science fiction film. And what highlights they are - tremendous in both categories, at least for 2000 when this film and DVD came out. At the time, they were the best special-effects I had ever seen, but strides are being made so fast in that category that every few years we movie fans are stunned at something new we see. Still, this DVD holds up.<br /><br />Audio-wise, the rear speakers come into to play as well as any movie I've heard.<br /><br />As for the story, it is a simple good guys-trying-to-get-the-bad guys fare. It's pure escapist fun made so with tons of sci-fi effects. The characters aren't particularly involving, either the "good"  or the "bad." The two leads, played by Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin, should have had us more interested in them, but didn't.  Jackman's "Logan/ Wolverine" always seemed to be pouting and angry.  (He got more personality as this series continued.)<br /><br />For me and most males, Rebecca Romjin-Stamos was a treat for the eyes. Her outfit was something to behold.<br /><br />If profanity bothers you, the film was very good in that department, too, as there was very little. Obviously, this film was popular enough to spawn multiple sequels.  Now that all three "X" films are out in a packaged Blu-Ray box set which, I've heard, looks and sounds fantastic, that's my next step.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly Good"></head><body><p>First of all, I haven't read Isaac Asimov's "I, Robot," so I don't have any basis on which to compare the book to the film.  However, I have watched many science fiction flicks.  I enjoy adventures such as the original "Star Wars" trilogy, action flicks like the recent "Resident Evil:  Apocalypse," and the type of sci-fi that leaves you in a reflective mood, such as "Close Encounters of the Third Kind."<br /><br />I expected "I, Robot" to lean towards the "Resident Evil" genre of sci-fi.  Plenty of shoot'em up action and brainless explosions that are good for a Sunday afternoon, but won't expect you to think too much.  Add to the fact that Will Smith is in the starring role, and I expected the action to be hopped up on streetwise, smarty-pants humor.  Imagine my surprise when, after viewing the film, I was amazed at how really good this flick is.<br /><br />Granted, it is full of fast-paced action that any Playstation fan would jump with glee for, but it also has a really great murder mystery aspect to it that leaves you questioning just who the bad guy really is.  Also, Smith's token smart mouth is toned down a little, and I actually enjoyed watching him on the screen.  He seems to have finally matured into an adult, and his face is finally showing a little age, which makes it easier to believe in him as a toughened cop.<br /><br />The story starts out with Smith's character, Spooner, investigating the murder of a brilliant scientist responsible for introducing personal robots into society.  These robots provide companionship, do manual labor, and serve as all-around go-to's when needed.  Of course, Spooner believes this reliance on robots is only the beginning of something horrible down the road.  He immediately suspects one of the newest robotic creations to be the murderer of the good doctor.  He, along with a fellow employee of the deceased doctor, goes out to find who or what did the deed and why they did it.  What follows is a quickly paced action film that has plenty of intelligence for the viewer with an I.Q. above the average moviegoer.<br /><br />The story does start out somewhat slow, but it picks up about thirty-minutes in on both the action and intellectual levels.  Don't worry, you can still watch this as a brainless flick, but its story is so good that you'll be hard pressed not to follow it.<br /><br />The special effects are fun to watch.  It is amazing how life-like the robots are.  Sonny, the murder suspect, manages to win over even the toughest critics with his human emotions and actions.  I forgot that he wasn't real while watching the movie, making this story that much easier to digest.<br /><br />The DVD itself is sparse on extras.  There is a little "making of" documentary and a stills gallery.  There's also a commentary provided for those folks who have nothing better to do.  Honestly, I glance at some extras on DVDs, but I hardly look at them more than once.  If you're like me, you won't miss the movie trailers, cast filmographies, or other fluff that is sometimes put on these discs.  I buy these things for the films on them, not to learn why certain scenes are left on the cutting room floor.<br /><br />In closing, buy this flick if you like intelligent murder mysteries with a twist.  If you like sci-fi flicks in general, this movie won't let you down.  If you're an action fan, this motion picture has plenty of that, too.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

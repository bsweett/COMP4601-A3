While the production values are great, and the story is actually terrific, the outcome is horrible. Incredibly amateurish dialogue and overuse of CGI ruin what could have been a great film. This was originally planned as a sequel to Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula, with Anthony Hopkins set to reprise his role of Van Helsing. Perhaps some of the quality of that original film would have benefited this absolutely pathetic attempt. Entertaining because of how bad it is, but truly forgettable. The audience was laughing for all the wrong reasons and that's never a good sign. One star for the plot, and another star for the casting.</p></body></html>

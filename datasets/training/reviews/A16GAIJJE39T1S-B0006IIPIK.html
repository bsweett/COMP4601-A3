<meta name="summary" content="Hilarious synthesis of 30's film noir and modern sci fi"></head><body><p>I don't know what the director had in mind for this movie, but for me this film is a sort of inspired comedy.  Carl Sagan once observed that modern science fiction movies are actually adventure movies that lack any tangible reference to science.  This is certainly the case here--but made all the more obvious by the fact that this world is made to seem to rely on twentieth century technology.  The effect of a flying aircraft carrier appearing out of nowhere to refuel the hero's single engine P-40 like fighter (a model of military industrial complex inefficiency and over budget thinking) was shocking to behold!  The explicit impossibility of this world seemed to exalt in technical absurdities rather than attempt to paper them over.  For my son and I (both of us engineers)--the surprising appearance of each incredible scene evoked uproarious laughter!<br /><br />I should also say that I loved the Art Deco look of everything from malevolent robots and rocket ships to newsrooms and skyscrapers.  It reminds me of the Forbidden Planet era conception of streamlined spacecraft that I enjoyed as a small child at the dawn of the space age.  How disappointing clunky are real space vehicles when compared to the clean lines of one of the shapely rocket arc seen in the final scenes of this movie--a veritable finned Cadillac of the heavens!</p></body></html>

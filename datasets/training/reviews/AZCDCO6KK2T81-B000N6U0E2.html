<meta name="summary" content="In Pursuit of Oscar"></head><body><p>***UPDATE:  I had the incredible good fortune to hear Gardner's story firsthand when my wife surprised me with tickets to see him when he visited our area and spoke at the Lancaster Chamber of Commerce on May 2, 2007.  He basically told his story as it was revealed in the film and noted some changes the film made such as in reality his son was only 2 when all this happened to him and not 5.  He did say something terrifically funny when he said, "I'm amazed that it cost Hollywood 70 million dollars to reproduce what I experienced for free."  His presentation was filled with such precious gems like that one.  Gardner continues to give back to people who desperately need it as his book was available after his speech and a portion of the proceeds went to a local charity and he does this everywhere he speaks.  Gardner is a truly inspirational individual and I was honored to hear his story firsthand.<br /><br />This is one of those films that can be very difficult to review without alienating somebody.  If you criticize Will Smith, his legions of fans will go on the attack.  If you criticize the film itself, you'll get blasted for being heartless.  Lastly, if, God forbid, you criticize a child's performance, you are considered ruthless.  I can see by the number of negative votes that I have received here that my point is somewhat valid even though I took great pains to praise this film where it appropriately deserved it, but I guess my criticism where poorly received.  I wish people knew how to use these "helpful" buttons more as they aren't meant to ONLY support reviews one agrees with.  I have given many "helpful" votes to review I totally disagree with as they supported their opinion well and got me to consider things I hadn't before.  Oh, well.  Here is my review and I still stand by it today.<br /><br />"The Pursuit of Happyness" was a hard film to watch as I believe it was intended by those involved as it is always very difficult to witness the heartaching struggles others sometimes have.  This is a truly moving story of a poverty-stricken family and a dad who all too often creates his own obstacles in life, but, nevertheless, continues to move forward with courage, dignity, love, and patience that few possess.  Although a flawed hero, Will's character, Gardner, is a hero in the true sense of the word and one can't help but feel that old phrase "There but through the grace of God walk I."  The main character and storyline are truly inspirational and Smith's acting here is something to really behold, but the film, for me, did have some serious flaws.<br /><br />On the positive end, the acting by Smith is nothing less than flawless.  His eyes show his pain and joy at any given moment.  I was absolutely brought to tears myself (my family too) when he's holed up in a subway bathroom with his kid pretending it's a cave and they are hiding out from dinosaurs.  Smith's slow, laborious, and silent weeping in that bathroom on the floor while holding his sleeeping son is one of the most emotional scenes ever filmed and that scene alone requires an Oscar nomination for him (which would be his second).  I was also moved to tears when Smith's character gets the job at the end of the film and does all he can not to cry in front of his new employers.  I have been in such a situation myself after losing a job and when I found another after a year of unemployment and losing my home; I could really relate to Smith's struggle to not cry in front of his new bosses.  By the way, I didn't spoil anything here as all, if not most, are aware of this man's success story already.<br /><br />Will's son is not the best actor, but he's engaging enough.  Some cliched script writing hurts him more than his ability to deliver a line.  He's just too perfect of a kid to believe and that affects how I actually view his performance and that, perhaps, isn't fair.  However, who can resist a real-life father and son act?  I can't.  It's just sad that the writers have him saying some silly and/or too mature lines over and over again.  In an overall good film this is a serious flaw that really stands out and can be distracting.<br /><br />In addition, the direction was another serious flaw with the film.  It labors too long in some areas and goes too fast in others, yet, I must admit that I appreciate the level of acting the director gets out of his actors in spite of his poor pacing and uneven direction.  I am as exhausted as Smith's character by the end of the film as he's always running somewhere.  I realize that may have been the intention of the film, but in actuality, it is annoying after awhile with it's redundancy.  Again, I know we are being asked to experience the tragedy of this man's existance at the worst time in his life; however, I'm also noting that the repetitive scenes of dispair wear away at an audience's patience at times.  I noticed many squirming in their seats at numerous such scenes.  A good point can be lost when overdone.  I had the awkward feeling that the director was feeling outshined by his cast and tried too hard to put his personal stamp on the film.<br /><br />I did love some specific elements in the film like how meaningless money is to those that have it.  A very memorable moment is when Smith's boss asks him for $5 to cover a cab ride and he gives it to him, leaving nothing left for himself or his son but a few dollars.  Oh, how we take money for granted.  Another such scene is when he shares a cab with another boss who stiffs him the $20 cab fee (assuming everyone has at least $20 bucks on them), forcing Smith's character to literally flee the cab and be chased by the driver, which, by the way, was a very well-directed sequence.<br /><br />All in all, this is a competent film with an extraordinary performance by Will Smith which earned him a well-deserved second Oscar nomination for Best Actor (the first was for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKMQ">Ali</a>), but just don't be surprised that the overall quality of the film is that of a TV-Movie; albeit, a very well-made TV-Movie.  I recommend this film for those who have the patience to sit through this kind of film which can be difficult due to its subject matter and its uneven pacing.  Poverty is never pretty to witness or experience, but stories like this need to be told and we need to listen to what it has to say.  This is a very inspirational film with moving performance and a number of memorable scenes.  I might not "buy" this DVD when it comes out (something I reserve for films that have great repeat value), but I would surely rent it and view it again and recommend others to view it as well.</p></body></html>

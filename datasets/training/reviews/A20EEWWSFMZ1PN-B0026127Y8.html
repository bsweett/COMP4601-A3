<meta name="summary" content="Standard get my child back - yet well executed"></head><body><p>A retired CIA agent lets his ex-wife twist his arm into letting their daughter round all over Europe.  He warned them of the possible and we would not have a movie if the possible did not happen. Yep the daughter was abducted by a ruthless cabal or two to serve in an unsavory capacity.<br /><br />"Let her go and you won't die." Now how many movies have we heard that in? Well a lot. But Liam Neeson can run with the best of them. He fights the odds and so-called friends to shoot, drive, stab, and what not his way through Sleaze Town and more.<br /><br />Will he succeed? Will we have fun kibitzing? Why do you find yourself sweating? Oh no you're going to watch it again aren't you?</p></body></html>

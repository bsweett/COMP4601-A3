<meta name="summary" content="Some Like It Hot"></head><body><p>In 1929 during the St. Valentines Day massacre, two traveling musicians, witness one of the hits initiated by the mob.  The only way the duo can think of to avoid being discovered is to join an all female band playing in Florida as women.  Joe is looking forward to the gig, so that he can spend more time with Sugar while Jerry is horrified to find himself fighting off the advances of a rich suitor.  Joe the consummate womanizer finally gets to see what it is like to be on the other side of the coin to see what he has been dishing out for years.<br /><br />Many see this as a ground breaking movie especially for the 1950's with the theme of cross dressing and gender roles, but I just enjoyed Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon giving some of the best comedic performances of their careers, and Marilyn Monroe shining her brightest.  It is laugh out loud funny, and a movie you will watch over and over again.</p></body></html>

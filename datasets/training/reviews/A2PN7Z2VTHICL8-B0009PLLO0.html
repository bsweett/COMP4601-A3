<meta name="summary" content="Okay, so it's not accurate, but it's definitely eye-candy"></head><body><p>Where to begin this review?  I almost feel like I have to defend my position on actually liking the film, which is hard for me to do because my liking of it is sensory and I am usually a more factual person.<br /><br />What's wrong with Alexander?  Well, it's difficult to be historically accurate even while studying a practically mythological figure, but if you are making a Hollywood film it is next to impossible.  So Alexander the movie only follows the historical aspects of Alexander The Great by the finest of threads.  The dialogue is a little stiff at times also, attempting to modernize into a recognizable pattern the speeches and rituals of a civilization that existed before Christ.  There's a Colin Farrell "buffalo shot" that should have been edited out.  And the plot skips around quite a bit, in an unnecessary fashion.  It could have been bloodier, too.<br /><br />What's right with Alexander?  For one thing, the stunning photography, breathtaking scenery, costume design, and realistic props and settings.  The battle scenes are spectacular, with arrows and pikes and vast armies.  There is one scene in particular, where Alexander goes up against a barbarian, filmed in slow motion as both horse and elephant rear up in facing off with each other, that is so captivating you will find yourself holding your breath.<br /><br />Colin Farrell did a remarkably good job in portraying Alexander, and Val Kilmer was exceptionally, and startlingly, good as Alexander's father, Philip.  Anthony Hopkins as Old Ptolemy and Christopher Plummer as Aristotle did fine performances, but their parts in the film were lesser than their known talents.  Angelina Jolie as Alexander's mother Olympias, surprised me.  Normally, I don't care for her acting, but she fit the role perfectly as a deadly beauty who fondles snakes and schemes for her son's greatness.  I've liked Rosario Dawson since her early appearance in 'Kids', and she doesn't disappoint in her role as Roxane, Alexander's barbarian wife.  I think that her part should have been greater in the film, with more played off of her love/hate relationship with Alexander, but this was a big story to put into one film anyway.  And Jared Leto...woof!  When did Jared Leto become hot?  When he put on eyeliner and a long-haired wig?  I'm not sure, but he plays his role as Hephaistion, Alexander's same-$ex lover, quite well.<br /><br />Alexander, then, amounts to some very nice eye-candy to watch for its entertainment value.  It's not a documentary but an epically filmed interpretation of Alexander's battle years, when he conquered most of the civilized world (at that time) in the span of eight short years.  Imagine 2500 years from now a film being made about, say, Ronald Reagan.  Will it be accurate?  Doubtful, but it will most likely be made to please the people of that era.<br /><br />So sit back, pop some popcorn, put the DVD on the bigscreen TV and turn the volume down.  Don't worry about what people say about the $exuality in the film, it is not overt or overplayed, it is simply portrayed as part of Alexander's life, as was common during the time frame of the epic.  Enjoy this film for the lush cinematography and save the documentary for the History Channel.  Its eye-candy, pure and simple.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

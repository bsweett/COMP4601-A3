I enjoyed the action (I'm easily entertained when it comes to movies with lots of gratuitous sex and violence), but don't expect much in the way of nuanced acting. The story line here, however, is stronger than in the first movie and the transformers themselves even more impressive, and with some very human personality quirks in some cases. Fans of C3PO and R2D2 will see that famous pair of robot friends reprised here in the two goofy, smaller transformers.<br /><br />For me this was a four star movie just for the entertainment value. For someone with more movie acumen than me it might be more like a three-star. Just my perhaps uninformed opinion. Also the John Turturro line where he says, "Now in position...below enemy scrotum," was hilarious. :-)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="LXG=EDM;  Extraordinarily Dumb Movie."></head><body><p>I love action movies, particularly fantasy/Sci-fi action.  Given this, I certainly have no problem setting aside reality for a while and getting lost in a good bit of fantasy.  I had sean some not-so-positive reviews of this film, so I lowered my expectations and hope for some fun excitement.  Oh, there was plenty of excitement.  However, there were so many dumb "flaws" in this film that it sort of sucked the fun out of it.  Let's review;<p>THE GOOD<p>-Special FX were very entertaining.  Hyde transformation was intense.<br />-Mr. Hyde was, by far, the most entertaining character in the film.<br />-The basic story was ok.  Adequate for an action film.<br />-Acting is passible. No glaring weeknesses here.<br />-CHaracter development was as good as could be expected for such a large ensamble.<br />-Music was really not a factor.  Didn't add or detract.<p>THE BAD<p>-A 400 foot long, 80 ft tall submarine would not fit in the canals of Venice let alone be able to make any turns.<br />-The entire city of Venice is not built on stilts.  Venice is a series of marshy islands.  The buildings are mostly 3 stories tall and anchored into the ground.  Placing bombs under the city as shown is not possible.  To sink such a large part of Venice would require the removal of the Islands.  Yea, right!!<br />-England and Germanys respective militaries did not have steel helmets in 1899.  These were developed during WWI (1918 ish).<br />-Nemos car is too 1930s.  As an industrial designer, I can tell you that the probability of someone developing a car of that style in 1899 just wouldn't happpen, not even a forward thinking guy like Nemo.  Car styling is evolutionary not revolutionary (dispite what the car makers tell you).<br />-GPS (global positioning system) in 1899?  COME ON!!!<br />-Invisible man survives siberian wilderness in winter and running out of a room after being flame-throwered...  WHILE NUDE!?!?!<br />-When the HQ of the LXG is first shown, Paintings of past "leagues" hang on the wall.  Later, the head of LXG tells the heros it was all a lie.  Were the paintings really necessary?  If this was the real HQ, who was running the show?  <p>-Plot has 9 bizillion holes in it.  Too difficult to trace them all.<br /> <p>I'm sure I'm missing a few things.  Some of this may seam nit-picky to some of you.  Just keep in mind that the film maker's responsibility is to make me believe that this fantasy is real (even if in a different world).  But you just can't ignore history or technological probability.  So much reality was suspended to make the story work that it falls into the realm of the rediculous!  It seams to me that the writers never researched anything!!!  They just did what ever would "look cool".  A good sci-fi or fantasy takes responsibility for making the viewer buy into the events that are happening on the screen.  LXG failed in it's responsibility to depict the year 1899, known architecture, and the laws of physics accurately.  Because of this, The longer I viewed the movie, the less I believed anything that was going on.  B.T.W.  I've never read the comic.  Perhaps it too is as rediculous as this movie, in which case they were trying to be honorable to the books.  Still makes for a rediculous film.  Curb your curiosity, wait and rent.  Save some money.</p></body></html>

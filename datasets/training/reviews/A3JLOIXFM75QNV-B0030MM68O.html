Nor is there anything wrong with the acting, direction, cinematography or length. But there was one aspect that stuck out like a sore thumb, for me anyway, and that was the portrayal of the main character, played by Jeremy Renner. While he is a fantastic actor and did a great job in this film, I felt his character was one huge clich&eacute;. I mean, how typical was his persona? Have we not seen this type of hot-shot character before? The macho, I'm-so-brave-and-unconcerned-and-I'm-going-to-ignore-all-the-rules-and commands.... His whole act felt very typical and unrealistic. Clearly, he loved doing what he did, and he knew he was good at it, but again, I couldn't help but feel like I've seen his character a million times before.<br /><br />I'm usually not a fan of war films, but The Hurt Locker felt different, I think because it concentrated on a certain aspect of the Iraq war, or at least a certain division of it, which it made is slightly more interesting than other war films I've seen. There is not much fighting or battles, just those few tense scenes that have you on the edge of your seat, but it seems enough. For me this movie was more about the character than the Iraq war, and again, that's where my major gripe comes into play. All in all though, I would recommend this film just for its intensity and unpredictability.</p></body></html>

NO matter how good or bad a film is, it's always called a chick flick, if one or 2 women are in it, even if most of the characters are guys such as Jerry McGuire which is a film about a football!  This movie was total fantasy, but not nearly as good as SITC, because the plot was empty.  Meryl Streep makes an otherwise silly movie even though she's a villain and you can't stand her. Don't you just love it when she throws her coat and handbag all around for others to pick up after her. Insane.  Never seen any boss do that before. And if they did, I'd quit. One time I worked for an attorney who yelled at me in front of everybody.  I told him off in front of everybody, and quit on the spot.  Anyway, the way she talks soooo under her breath, and treats everybody as if they were invisible toads made her too one dimensional.  The cast was adequate, and all and all it tried to be an entertaining film, but it had no real plot.  Just a bunch of idiots dressing up in clothes to show off, that few people could pull off, unless they were models. Few people are.<br /><br />Little bit of Sex and the City flashbacks when Carrie went to work for Vogue and had a similar boss with Candice Bergen but Streep played the fashion queen much tougher and snobbish than Bergen.  Anyway, as mean as Streep played it, let's face it, she's made some damn good films. Meryl Streep can be anybody, but let's face it, she'll never be better than the "Choice" she made in "Sophie."</p></body></html>

Did the train roll off the trax in the EPs ofc and no one could say NO due to the Jew Killing Revenge scene???  Hitler didn't even look like he suffered as much as Walz did with the slice n dice screaming drawn (haha) out scene...The mess of dialogue and subtitles just made me insane and the plodding pace amazed me at my prowess of patience to finally see the damn cinema burn...BORING!!!</p></body></html>

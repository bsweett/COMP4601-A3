<meta name="summary" content="Superman is Jusus?  Well, I'm glad that's cleared up!"></head><body><p>I've read quite a few reviews of this film here at amazon.  Most of them are very valid (even with wildly diverse ratings).  I gave it 3 stars because I was entertained.  I noticed many of the story flaws and raised many of the same questions in my mind that many reviewers noted.  Usually planet sized story/plot holes bug the crap out of me.  But for some reason, I still enjoyed "Superman Returns".<br /><br />The one thing that really distracted me as the film went along, was the blatant, obvious rehashing of the story of Christ.  Why this was a point of interest of the film makers I don't know.  I could have done without it.  I'm not against the teachings of Christ (anti-Christ?), but does it really belong in a Superman film?<br /><br />I'm sure many (most) of the people who saw this film noticed the Christ parody. If you're not sure you've noticed them all, here's a list of stuff that I noticed that might help:<br /><br />-Supermans dad, (Jorell/God?) says (I paraphrase) "Humans are basically good so should be protected (saved)from evil(sin).  So I give them my Son."<br /><br />-Bitter Lois says the world does not need a savior (Superman).  Superman says he can here everything, the cries for help.  "Sounds to me like they need a Savior".<br /><br />-Superman on a couple of occasions says "I'm everywhere, I'll always be around".  May the Lord Superman be with you.<br /><br />-Superman gets Lois pregnant without actually doing the deed. (that whole "spin the world backward to reverse time" trick in Superman 2}.  A fairly immaculate conception.<br /><br />-Superman sacrifices himself to save the "good" humans for the "sinful bad" humans.  He died to save humans from human sin (a bit stretchy, but not too much)<br /><br />-Superman is reserected from the dead.  (happy Easter Superman!)<br /><br />-Superman flys to the outer reaches of Earths atmosphere and creates a cross by extending his arms out to the side and pointing his legs straight down.  (Not well disguised BTW).<br /><br />I'm probably missing something, but that's a pretty long list of coincidences.  As much as I enjoyed the movie with it's stupid story/plot holes, great special effect, fun acting and cameos, I really could have done without the Idea that our God(s) are actually Kryptonians and Superman is our savior.  That is enough to lose a star in my rating.  In a nutshell, this film, though not great, is entertaining.  There are some slow spots, and it ends with a fizzle.  And you will have to be someone who is not offended easily when it comes to religeous mockery.  If I were a highly religious person of any faith, I might be offended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="(3.5 STARS) "The Prestige": Dazzling and Entertaining"></head><body><p>The "magic tricks" themselves featured in "The Prestige" may not impress you much - some of you can detect them before the ending, I think - but don't worry, because the real magic of "The Prestige" is the seamless storytelling of Christopher Nolan, who tells the engaging story of two rival magicians of the turn-of-the-century London, Borden and Angier, using Nolan's trademark, non-linear timeline. Supported by the wonderful cast from England and America, "The Prestige" is a dazzlingly entertaining film full of twists and turns.<br /><br />Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are perfectly cast as Borden and Angier, formerly friends and assistants to a lesser-talented magician. But they become long-time rivals after a disastrous accident on the stage, and both illusionists are willing to sacrifice everything, one for craft, the other for showmanship.<br /><br />This is how I would describe the world of "The Prestige," but the simple truth is the film itself is magic, or illusion, of very entertaining kind, which makes us keep guessing "What next?" with a blend of real history and total fantasy. See the character of Nicola Tesla, real-life revolutionary inventor, played by delightfully eccentric David Bowie, and you know what I mean. On the opposite side of him lives a contraption inventor Cutter, played by Michael Caine, whose humanity makes a great contrast to two star magicians.<br /><br />Unfortunately the film is not perfect. Like "Batman Begins," Christopher Nolan still does not know how to create credible female characters in spite of the impressive cast. Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall and Piper Perabo appear as supports, but their roles are relegated to the second fiddle.<br /><br />"The Prestige" is not exactly about the magic itself; some part of it involves sci-fi elements that even David Copperfield cannot or wouldn't use. The film is more about the rivalry between two magicians, which result in passion and obsession hidden under the spectacular stage tricks. As such "The Prestige" is successful.</p></body></html>

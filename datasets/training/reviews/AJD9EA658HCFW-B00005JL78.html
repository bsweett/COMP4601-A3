<meta name="summary" content="Cruise and Speilberg come through"></head><body><p>What if you could stop a crime before it was ever created ? This was the brilliant idea of Steven Speilberg that is the plot-line for "Minority Report"<br /><br />Tom Cruise plays character Chief John Anderton. He is in charge of the "pre-crime" unit. Through all of the scepticisim Anderton believes his program is without flaw, until his fate is put in the program.<br /><br />Without giving away spoilers, I can't say to much more about this film, only that it has great acting in Tom Crusie and great direction from Steven Speilberg.</p></body></html>

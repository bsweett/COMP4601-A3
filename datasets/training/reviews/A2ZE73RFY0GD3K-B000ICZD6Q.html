<meta name="summary" content="Good For What It Was, But Not What We Were Led To Expect"></head><body><p>Once again, Hollywood advertising attempted to lure masses of viewers to theaters by billing a film as an uproarious, chick-flick romantic comedy -- when actually it was a mildly amusing melodrama.  Those expectations resulted in the somewhat bland reviews we see below, which are reactions not to the film, but what we believed we'd be seeing.<br /><br />The story is actually fairly reasonable, a young corporate firecracker being put in charge of a department containing much older employees.  His rhetoric in front of his staff ("synergy!" and so forth) accurately reflected the babbling nonsense most of these corporate-manager types spew... and that theme was re-emphasized, when big-wig Malcolm McDowell appeared at the end, and delivered a typical executive's meaningless buzzword monologue.<br /><br />The characters' reactions to the developments seemed accurate, appropriately funny or not funny according to the situations.  Another reason for viewer blandness is the movie's ending -- it did not yield the formula chick-flick wrap-up... it actually ended reasonably realistically.  This film is good to see once; it's certainly not one you will cherish for your DVD library.</p></body></html>

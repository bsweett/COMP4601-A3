<meta name="summary" content="Predictable, yes, but involving character study worth viewing"></head><body><p>Mikael H?fstr&ouml;m is a Swedish film director making his English speaking film debut with a atmospheric little thriller that, despite the gaps in the screenplay by Stuart Beattie based on the thriller novel by James Siegel that allow the story to become predictable, gives us a solid bit of entertainment as escapism. His style is tight, tense, and he is in love with  quirky camera angles that keep the viewer on edge.<br /><br />What begins as seemingly a little light comedy romance on a train in Chicago where ad exec Charles Schine (Clive Owen), married to Deanna (Melissa George) and father a young daughter Amy (Addison Timlin) who suffers form renal failure and is on dialysis, quite by serendipity is rescued from a lack of ticket by the beautiful, smart, classy Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Aniston) who is also married and also has a beloved daughter.  What develops is an intellectual repartee that evolves slowly but insidiously into passion and the two find themselves checking into a seedy hotel for a tryst, a grand mistake because in medias res their room is crashed by a smarmy Philippe LaRoche (Vincent Cassel) who begins his blackmail of the affair by beating Charles and raping Lucinda.  After LaRoche leaves with their wallets, Lucinda begs Charles not to go to the police, as it would destroy her marriage.<br /><br />The manner in which the blackmail is drawn out with repeated threats and confrontations with both LaRoache and his hit man Dexter (Xzibit), Charles' confiding in an ex-con Winston (RZA) who proceeds to help Charles, and Charles' eventual loss of the money saved for his daughter's medical treatment make for the cat and mouse chase and game in which the true identity of each of the 'players' is revealed and Charles learns his lesson the hard way.<br /><br />To say more would disrupt the flow of the story for those who don't identify con games easily.  Clive Owen is magnetic and though Jennifer Anniston doesn't have a lot of screen time, when she is on she proves she can step into roles much different than previous fluffy ones.  The supporting cast is strong, and while this isn't a great movie, it certainly is a well-paced gripping little bit of entertainment if you allow yourself to flow with it.  The first twenty minutes of the movie justify its being made!  Grady Harp, March 06</p></body></html>

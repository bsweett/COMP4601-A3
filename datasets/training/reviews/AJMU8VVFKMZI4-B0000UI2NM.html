<meta name="summary" content="Vampires and Werewolves--oh my!!"></head><body><p>Other than a loud and annoying soundtrack, I truely enjoy this film.  I thought the story managed a unique twist on an old theme.  Sure there are shots that look as though it belonged in the Matrix but all in all it works. I'm not saying that there aren't a few plot holes or that the movie isn't riddled with coincidences--it is.  I mean the finally fight between Victor and Michael was as anticlimatic as one could get.  We finally get this vampire/werewolf hybrid and Victor kicks his butt.  Selene turns out to be all anyone needs.  But hey, all the fighting poses were sleek and elegant.  More like dancing than fighting.  If you enjoy vampire stories--this film should still make your must see list.</p></body></html>

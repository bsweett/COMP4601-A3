Well the science fiction genre has many facets to it. You have the space opera (Star Wars, Fifth Element, etc), the stellar exploration (2001, Destination Moon, etc), the monster movie (Cloverfield, Alien, etc), cyber punk (The Matrix, Ghost in the Shell), and a few other categories that all make up the sci-fi genre. While all are considered sci-fi what many fans call a true science fiction is one where the story moves beyond the confines of a futuristic setting or technology. When a science fiction concept is placed in a situation that really gets you thinking is that these fans are hungry for, and Moon is the perfect meal for what they crave.<br /><br />Moon is not an action film so don't expect Bruckheimer-esque explosions or flashing guns. Moon is a drama at the highest sense of the word. The unfolding story is dramatic. Dramatic in a what they can really mess with your head if you really stop and think about it. Moon is about a single man working in a mining facility on (of course) the moon. Just when he is about to finish his three year assignment everything he knew falls horribly out of control. There is of course a plot twist that brings this about, but the masterful way director Duncan Jones presents it makes the twist itself less surprising than the implications that it represents. We are talking a major screwing around with your thoughts and emotions. I don't want to ruin it for you and I really recommend you NOT to try and find out before you see the movie. It really will spoil the effect for you.<br /><br />Speaking of effect the movie has a top notch production on both sets and special effects. Moon's budget is reported to be a minuscule $5 million, however the movie looks like it was made with ten times that amount. The sets are very convincing and make you believe there can actually be a moon facility. The style is very much like Stanley Kubrick's 2001 or the first two Alien movies. Absolutely no computer generated special effects are in this film. The sets are really built. The moon and the buildings/vehicles on it are actual models. Everything is done with practical techniques and the results are more impressive than many CG-heavy films made today. In other words eye candy.<br /><br />There is essentially one actor in the movie and that's Sam Rockwell. Playing the character that has, oh lets say 99.9% of the screen time, Sam has to really carry the movie all on his own. This he does with gusto. Rockwell makes this movie just as much as the impressive sets and excellent script. You also get Kevin Spacey's voice as the station's computer, GERTY. You can think 2001's HAL with a bit more personality and charm.<br /><br />This movie has such a wonderful combination of style and substance. Add to that the fact it's an independent film made with a budget that wouldn't even pay for an A-list actor. If this underdog story can get any more endearing I have no idea how. Moon has made its money in worldwide box office sales and never was shown in much more than 250 theaters. What's even cooler is as of this writing Moon is still being shown in a few theaters. Better still in the month of October it's been increasing both it's theater count and box office draw. Amazing for a movie that was released in June.<br /><br />Despite Moon's longevity in the box office odds are you may have missed this film's theatrical release altogether considering how low the theater count has been. Now you have a perfect opportunity to see this amazing film for yourself. The DVD release I know more about is the U.K. release, which comes about a month before the U.S. release. Here's what I found what is coming on the U.K. DVD:<br /><br />- 2.40:1 Anamorphic Widescreen<br />- English Dolby Digital 5.1<br />- English and Hindu subtitles<br />- Two commentaries with Director Duncan Jones on other production staff members<br />- "Whistle" a short sci-fi film made by Duncan Jones back in 2000.<br />- Documentary "The Making of Moon"<br />- Documentary "Creating the Visual Effects"<br />- Science Center Q&A with Director Duncan Jones<br />- Filmmaker's Q&A at the Sundance Film Festival<br /><br />There is also a Blu-Ray release that has a couple extra features and more audio/subtitle options. As for if the U.S. release being the same as the British release I see no reason why it wouldn't considering how incredibly easier it would be to port that release (aside from changing the region code) than to produce a completely different compilation. Keep an eye out for announcements around the holidays, folks.<br /><br />If you are a science fiction fan, a true science fiction fan, then you absolutely must see this movie. Trust me. It's right up there with Blade Runner, 2001, Gattaca and other great sci-fi dramas. If you like dramas I think you should check this movie out too, and don't be afraid of the fact it's in outer space. The story that you get from this "space" movie will be far greater than you reluctance to trust in a good sci-fi drama. For the rest of you if you love a good story that will make you think and don't mind it not being your standard popcorn movie I say give it a shot. You won't be sorry.</p></body></html>

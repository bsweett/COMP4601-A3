He starts a riot and kills a man in tent city. With his other Cuban refugee friends, he gets further involved in cocaine deals, starts a drug cartel and becomes the most richest, notorious killer the state of Florida has ever seen.<br /><br /> This powerful film is known for its grotesque bloody and grueling violence and the numerous use of a certain adult curse word.<br /><br />  Cast includes: Al Pacino, Steven Bauer, Pepe Serna, F. Murray Abraham, Manuel Padilla Jr, Robert Loggia, Michelle Pfeiffer, Miriam Colon, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Richard Belzer, Angel Salazar, Arnaldo Santana, Paul Espel, Mark Margolis.<br />  Manuel Padilla Jr had a mustache in this film. He was in the shower scene.<br /><br />  This film did not receive any Academy Award nominations. 1983 was the year we saw <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000055ZF6">Terms of Endearment</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000092T6N">The Right Stuff (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VC99HQ">Tender Mercies</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000305ZZ2">Fanny and Alexander (The Theatrical Version) - Criterion Collection</a>.<br />  The <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLEY">Miami Vice - Season One</a> tv series debuts the next year.<br /><br />  Michelle Pfeiffer has a nice line during the sunken-bathtub scene, I think we can all agree with.<br />  Oliver Stone wrote the screenplay.<br /><br />  I was not able to review the Bonus Features of Disc 2. However, their is a featurette where to can see the difference between the theatrical version and the edited television version.<br />  DVD includes options of English, Spanish, French.

<meta name="summary" content="Unbelievably awesome movie"></head><body><p>Remember the intro to Saving Private Ryan when they land on the beach and get killed. Imagine a whole movie having that feel but still maintaining other aspects of good storyline. That is what this movie is about. One of the best war movie I have watched. Bluray quality is awesome.</p></body></html>

This movie deserves full concentration and I found it a bit exhausting at times (but worthwhile).<br /><br />  This is a flawed film (otherwise I would have given it 5 stars) but it does so much SO well that it nearly pulls it off. Both Huge Jackman and Christian Bale are in top form, playing rival magicians, each with a special talents. Bale plays a magician with some spectacular skills but lacking in dramatic performance. Jackman has the drama down pat but isn't as talented a magician and he is obsessed with learning his rival's secrets. Add to that some romance, jealousy, a former friendship between the two magicians and Michael Caine as a superb wise man and observer of the whole situation and you have an excellent film.<br /><br />  Still, there is something lacking, perhaps because the director is relatively new. At times, the film seems to drag and there are a lot of loose ends that don't make sense unless you pay close attention (I actually had to go back, scene by scene, to put it all together after watching it the first time).<br /><br />  Even so, this movie is superior to so much that is out there and the actors do a superb job in delineating the dangers of obsession - as well as the rewards.</p></body></html>

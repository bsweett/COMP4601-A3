Now, as some have already noted whether here or in media scrutiny, not all of this film follows Nash's life accurately.  Some of this film is fictionalized, but isn't that for the most part what always happens.  Just because it's a true story doesn't mean Hollywood doesn't feel the need to tamper.  At least here the tampering does not by any means take away from the power within the film and the performances that dominate.  Nash's life story is still portrayed effortlessly and beautifully, compelling and entertaining and full of just about every aspect of a priceless and award worthy film.  `A Beautiful Mind' truly has it all.<br /><br />Russell Crowe here delivers a breathtaking performance as John Nash, a brilliant math student who gets to the top only to tumble back down to the bottom at breakneck speed.  Living a life that in the end appears mostly a lie, Nash eventually is diagnosed with schizophrenia.  At this point in his life, married with a child and working a steady job, Nash and those around him are finding it difficult to differentiate reality from the creations of his mind.  The movie then turns its focus on Nash's recovery and the effect his sickness has on those closest to him.<br /><br />Crowe is truly the star here, swallowing whole this character driven study on the human spirit and determination to survive.  He engulfs the screen and makes this mans plight come alive for the audience.  What's commendable here is that Howard's directing and of course the script, adapted from Sylvia Nasar's biography, allow for the viewer to really connect with the entire cast, most importantly Nash himself.  This proves effective because once Nash's life is shattered before our very eyes and he begins to crumble we are brought to a place deep within our emotions that would have been impossible to touch had we not come to know Nash before his world came tumbling down.  We fall in love with this man and so we feel his pain, his wife's pain and are emotionally distressed alongside them both.<br /><br />Alongside Crowe both Jennifer Connelly and Paul Bettany deliver astounding performances as Nash's longsuffering wife and imaginary best friend.  Jennifer's Oscar winning performance is full of so much life, so much pain and emotional attachment that we can relate to and understand her feelings every step of the way.  We watch her transform from this woman who knew how to control the things around her, including Nash, to a woman scared of what was going to happen next, a woman who felt detached from all she thought was real.  Bettany's portrayal of Nash's college roommate is high spirited and refreshing.  He serves as our brightest comic relief but also our biggest heartbreak as we watch Nash realize he never truly had his friendship at all.<br /><br />Crowe, one of our finest actors, is a true chameleon and he engages himself so far into this role that he becomes John Nash, and watching that transformation is utterly rewarding.  His determination and fervor are so invested in this performance from the moment he appears on screen that one is automatically drawn to him and connected to him entirely.  From start to finish `A Beautiful Mind' proves itself worthy of our attention and consideration and is sure to astonish and amaze you.  From its heartbreaking story to its brilliantly crafted direction to its powerhouse performances, `A Beautiful Mind' is a winner from the top of its head to the tip of its toes.  The well rounded supporting cast including the likes of Ed Harris and Josh Lucas continue to astonish in their respective roles and aid in delivering one of the warmest and beautifully articulated Hollywood experiences.  This, my friends, is what going to the movies is all about.</p></body></html>

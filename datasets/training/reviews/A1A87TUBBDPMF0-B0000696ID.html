<meta name="summary" content="Spielberg's E.T. is Still Magical After 20 Years"></head><body><p>One of my favorite films has always been Steven Spielberg's E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial, his gentle fable about the unlikely friendship between a boy and a funny-looking botanist from another planet...maybe from another galaxy.<p>Working from a screenplay by Melissa Mathison (from a story penned by the director), Spielberg tells a very personal tale about the effects of divorce on children (a theme he explores later in 2002's Catch Me If You Can) and adds a wonderful science-fiction twist.<p>We all know the story by heart: an alien botanist is stranded on Earth when his ship has to flee from government agents led by "Keys" (Peter Coyote).  Frightened and alone, the alien is discovered hiding in an L.A. home's tool shed by Elliott (Henry Thomas), a smart 9 year old who is having a hard time coping with his parents' recent divorce.  Elliott, his brother Mike (Robert McNaughton) and sister Gertie (a pre-Charlie's Angel Drew Barrymore) befriend the strange being they'll eventually name E.T. and will help him "phone home."<p>Audiences the world over were won over by this simple yet touching film, and by the end of its theatrical run it had become the biggest box office hit of its time, surpassing Star Wars, the previous top-grosser.  With its mix of comedy, suspense, and Walt Disney-like fantasy, E.T. received both popular and critical acclaim, including several Academy Award nominations, including Best Score for John Williams' wonderful music, Best Original Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Picture.  Although E.T. won the best score and original screenplay awards, Sir Richard Attenborough's drama about India's most famous leader beat out Spielberg and E.T. in the latter categories.<p>Last year, Amblin Entertainment and MCA/Universal released a 20th Anniversary Edition of E.T. in theaters. With its soundtrack digitally remastered and some scenes tweaked with computer graphic imaging, a new generation of viewers saw this family classic on the big screen.  And in November of 2002, E.T. finally was released on the DVD format.<p>The DVD 2-disc set includes both versions of the film, a rare event for DVD releases.  Universal had originally planned to release the 2002 version separately and to sell the 1982 version in a more expensive boxed set.  Spielberg heard of this and vetoed the plan, thereby allowing everyone to own both versions of his most personal film at a reasonable price.<p>This is a must-get DVD for Spielberg fans...and for children of all ages.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="lotsa explosions"></head><body><p>This movie came quite a while after the second one was made, and to be honest, this movie simply doesn't add as much to the story. The first and second were awesome. I can't say this installment was bad or anything, but the story wasn't as tight as the first two, and felt rather unneeded.<br /><br />One thing I can say is that there's lots of explosions and property damage, so if you're the kind of person who likes seeing that, then you WILL enjoy this movie. There's a memorable scene where they're driving a truck with an arm and the arm drags along and destroys so many things as the truck is driving along, and it's quite the visual to see, or where Terminator and the female Terminator are fighting in the bathroom at the army base and they pretty much tear everything up - urinals, sinks, toilets, walls. Freaking awesome.<br /><br />This movie serves more as visual candy than a solid story, so it's not for everyone. Still, I enjoyed it, if not as much as the first two.</p></body></html>

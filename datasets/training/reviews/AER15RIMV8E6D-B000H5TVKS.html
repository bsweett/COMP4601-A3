After bailing his son out, Detective Eric Matthews finds out where Jigsaw is hiding, but for Jigsaw, getting caught is part of the game. Eight people are trapped in a house. Included in the game are Amanda from the original, Eric's son; Daniel, Xavier, Obi, Gus, Laura, Addison, and Jonas. They all must find an antidote for the poison gas they are breathing. Later, Xavier chases Amanda and Daniel to the classic Saw bathroom. Eric is finally enraged by Jigsaw that he beats him up until he tells him where the house is. If you love horror, Saw, and twists, you'll love SAW 2!!!</p></body></html>

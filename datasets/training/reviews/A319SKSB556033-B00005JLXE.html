Okay, I am certainly NOT a fan of Ben Affleck but his presence in this film was an indifferent one rather than an aggravating one. <p>For those of you who are unfamiliar Daredevil is also known as Matt Murdock, the blind lawyer. But though his eyes do not work his other 4 sense do to a superhuman degree. Sounds, smells, touches and tastes go together to form a bizarre sight that has pros and cons over normal vision. It's pretty cool concept and it's reasonably well done.<p>But Daredevil has NO plot! It's a swift 90 minutes of practically nothing. The most involving part of the film is the romance between Affleck and Garner but it's cut short with the arrival of Colin Farrell who plays Bullseye, a paper-thin but funny character. Many have been annoyed at the fact that the Kingpin is played by a Black-American actor. But what does THAT matter? Who cares if he's white in the comic book? Michael Clarke Duncan brings some formidable integrity to the role but does come off as a bit too cuddly at the same time.<p>A tiny bit of story is set up but it's over very soon. I guess the best you could say is that Daredevil doesn't outstay its welcome. But you'll not remember it 5 minutes after seeing it. And I don't like the fact they chose to separate all Daredevil and Spiderman links just because they were licensed to different studios. <p>The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with a very powerful DTS 5.1 track. Plus a bunch of extras I don't care about.</p></body></html>

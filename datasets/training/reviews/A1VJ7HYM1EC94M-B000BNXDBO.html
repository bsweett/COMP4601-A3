<meta name="summary" content="Mindless Fun"></head><body><p>This is far superior to most of the movies cranked out in this genre with some classic takes on gross out moments (though the girls playing a toilet version of the game "Battleship" almost had me wretching).<br /><br />The actors playing Harold & Kumar are likeable and it's a nice turn to see stoners played with something resembling intelligence.  The movie wisely pokes fun at itself and at just about every religious and societal group imaginable.<br /><br />The movie is worth a watch if only for Neil Patrick Harris playing himself as a shallow Ecstasy tripping, sex-obsessed former star.  It's nearly impossible not to break into hysterics at the idea of Dougie Houser getting aroused by (and involved in) a car seat.<br /><br />Hardly great movie making, Harold & Kumar is still a helluva lot of fun.  Especially under the influence.</p></body></html>

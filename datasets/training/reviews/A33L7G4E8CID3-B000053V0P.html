Seeing it for the second time here made me reconsider. This movie blows. Sure, there's plenty of action, and little else. Will Smith plays a fighter pilot, Jeff Goldblum a computer expert, and Bill Pullman plays the President in this film. This movie, in which aliens invade the Earth, cannot be called science fiction. Science fiction is Star Wars, 2001, and Starship Troopers. This movie does do exactly what it set out to do. The special effects are incredible, the sound is extremely good, the alien ships do look, alien. On the other hand, the aliens themselves are laughable, as is the &quot;plot&quot;, which should make comic-book writers shudder. Pancake characters round out this film that was so successful the first time they are selling it again so that the company can get more cash to make more movies like this. So if you want an post-lobotomy action movie, you've come to the right place.</p></body></html>

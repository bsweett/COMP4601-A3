<meta name="summary" content="Classic horror filmmaking"></head><body><p>Carrie has everything you could possibly want in a horror film.  Good characters, a good plot, good acting, and some very unsettling violence to top everything off.  Anyone who knows horror knows the ending of Carrie, but unless you have seen it for yourself (in the context of viewing the whole film) you will never know the intensity, brutality, and shock value of the prom sequence.  Brian De Palma put his name on the map with this movie, and rightfully so.<br /><br />Most know the basic plot of Carrie:  troubled teen is made fun of at school, abused physically and mentally at home by a psychotically religious mother, and the trouble teen just happens to be able to practice telekinesis.  Not a good combination.  The film moves along at an awesome pace, as De Palma lets the viewer get sucked in almost the exact way that Carrie is getting sucked in, just to have it all come crashing down in the gut-wrenching finale.<br /><br />This film belongs on the top of most horror aficionado's all-time best list, and it is definitely one of Brian De Palma's best films.</p></body></html>

The problem with this group is they don't go to the movies much. This will do well in dvd sales & pay for view tv. Anyway, I'm a fan & have seen it. It's behind the scenes look at the radio show, with lots of stars playing the characters of a typical show. Kevin Kline is Guy Noir, the house dick & narrator of the thread-bare plot: closing night of the long running, live radio show. Woody Harrelson is Dusty, a cowboy singing lewd country western. Has Meryl Strepp ever had a bad performance? She's fabulous here at turns funny, sad & can really sing. She is Yolanda, part of a sister act with Lily Tomlin as Rhonda. There are so many more & a few cameos.  Even the angel of death, played by a beautiful Virginia Madsen, shows up in a fantasy bit, to claim a cast member. Over it all is Garrison Keilor (GK) with running gags, off-beat songs & commercial spoofs. Robert Altman directed with a light hand & this is much like the original radio show, which is still running. This can be viewed by all ages but kids may get bored.  It is funny through-out if you have developed a sense of humor. I look forward to the dvd which I am sure will have lots of extras.</p></body></html>

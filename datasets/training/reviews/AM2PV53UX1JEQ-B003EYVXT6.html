But this nauseating movie queasily offers up a modern Frankenstein story that goes places you don't want to go.  Dren, the hybrid hottie, is inconsistent as a creature - she sometimes looks as real as can be, and at other moments looks like an old-fashioned claymation figure.  There are rare glimmers of wit and comedy (in the naming of the other mutant "children"; in the film noir performance of the French billionaire fundress) - but nothing ever comes of it. Sure, Adrien Brody has never looked better, but c'mon - the truth is, SPLICE is one big yuck.</p></body></html>

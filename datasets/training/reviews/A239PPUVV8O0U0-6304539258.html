<meta name="summary" content="The Movie That Revitalized Sci-Fi for Future Generations"></head><body><p>Note- for this and the subsequent films, I will be reviewing the theatrical releases, not the re-released special editions.<br /><br />Science fiction was hugely popular in the 50s with the Jet Age and the Space Race. There were even the Flash Gordon serials earlier than that. But once the sixties hit, especially the late sixties, movie makers went with more realistic stories. I know 2001: A Space Odyssey and Star Trek were made in that time frame, but they were still along telling a more realistic (for that genre anyway) story. Then this came along! With cutting edge special effects (for the time) and an interesting story made this one of the highest grossing films in  history. And also influenced the people behind the Bond films (FYEO was supposed to be after TSWLM but due to the popularity of this, was pushed back and MR was filmed instead.) and the people behind Star Trek (though two totally different things, this did influence them to change the Phase Two TV project into the first film).<br /><br />That's enough backstory. The acting is better than what we'd get in episodes 2 and 3 (especially from Hayden Christensen). Mark Hamill, better known today as the voice of the Joker on the various DCAU projects, plays Luke Skywalker with innocence and sincerity as we see the young hero thrust from his average lifestyle into the battle to save the galaxy. Harrison Ford plays Han Solo with a cockiness yet is the rogue with a heart of gold (I think he was just warming up for Indiana Jones). Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia, I think though I maybe wrong, is the first female movie character during the women's libs of the seventies to be able to take charge of a situation (like during the rescue in the prison cell) and hold her own in a gun fight. Darth Vader (suit actor David Prowse and voiced by James Earl Jones) is one of the more intimidating villains in cinema history and just as formidable in a lightsaber duel and a dog fight in space. Along with Tarkin, played by an impressive Peter Cushing, is almost as cold as Vader himself (since Tarkin is pretty much ordering Vader around in this), especially when he threatens Leia to blow up Alderaan. And lastly, Alec Guinness plays Obi-Wan Kenobi as a gentle, caring teacher to Luke though an old man, can still be pretty formidable in a fight. And the only human character who actually retains any dignity with his portrayal in the recent films. Again the incomprable John Williams is at the conductor's position, with another rousing score of action and suspense, though this is when his movie scores started to share some similar cues (most, if not all his scores are done by the London Symphony Orchestra).<br /><br />Now I will say that I saw the Special Editions before I saw the original prints and I did enjoy them. But after seeing the original release (though it should've recieved the same treatment that the other editions got), I will say that it is the superior version. Lucas needs to stop "improving" his movies and leave them the way they are (like his Young Indiana Jones series, I heard they filmed new stuff and removed whole episodes from continuity). He totally dishonors all the work that went into these original productions and only does it so he can re-release it on whatever video format and make a profit. I don't think he cares so much for the most popular film in his vault.</p></body></html>

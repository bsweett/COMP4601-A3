<meta name="summary" content="Great Movie, But bad DVD..."></head><body><p>C'mon. This has to be the second best horror movie (below The Exorcist.) The acting. The camera work. The story. The music...all great! It's scary and funny (for those of you with a sick sense of humor) at the same time! It doesn't get much better than this!<p>But there's only one problem; This DVD [is not good] what's up with the fullscreen format here? Not much bonus stuff either! The cover doesn't tell you much about the film and should be replaced.<p>Well, that's about all I have to say, but hear this; This movie is great, so produce a special edition to go along with it...</p></body></html>

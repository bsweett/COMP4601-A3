The visual and audio for the film were pretty good (especially considering how many different times this movie's been re-edited, re-shot, etc.).  The documentary (over an hour and a half long) seems to squash any necessity for an audio commentary.  Seeing how a lot of these physical effects were done reminded me how far film effects have gone over the years and shows how the little experiments can pay off big.  Included are some deleted scenes (almost all I believe come from the previous versions of the film) and some trailers.  However, the main reason for this purchase for me is the film itself.  Though Steven Spielberg admits that out of all his films that &quot;it's the one that dates him as a person now&quot;, it's one of those films that still has resonance with the little kid in me.  It's a truly great film, and one of my personal favorites.</p></body></html>

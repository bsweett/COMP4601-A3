<meta name="summary" content="One of the most absurd move I've ever seen. Zero star out of 5."></head><body><p>This is a movie about Secret service. One should expect logic, action and suspense from it, right?<br />The most disappointing thing about it is there's no logic. Agent Pete Garrison (Michael Douglas),<br />kissed the First Lady without closing all the doors right in the house where the President and<br />other agents were resting! The simmering scene was photographed by a mole. It was later used<br />to blackmail Pete. Please be reminded that, Pete had more than 20 years of experience as<br />a Secret agent. Yeah, right! Where's his intelligence? No wonder Secret Service had a mole when<br />they had an agent like Pete. If this was a fantasy movie like Lord of the Ring, I would be able to ignore<br />this illogical hole.<br /><br />There are much more better action or supense movies than this.</p></body></html>

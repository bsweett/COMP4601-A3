<meta name="summary" content="Find Lost"></head><body><p>When I first saw promos for ABC's Lost, I was very skeptical about how the writers were going to carry on a show about people stranded on a tropical island for a few years, let alone only a season.  I thought that there was only so many stories they could do if this was a serious drama.  The show premiered to rave reviews, but I never had the time to watch.  Then one of my friends told me a little bit about the show, and it sounded interesting, so I decided to give it a try.  Oh man, is this ever a good show, and was I ever wrong about problems with stories!  In an inspired move, every episode focuses on a character, and shows scenes from their life in flashback (except for the pilot and season finale episodes, which show scenes of multiple characters).  These flashbacks reveal defining moments in the characters' lives that show why they act the way they do on the island.  With a main cast of 14 people (or castaways), there are a lot of interesting, sad, and dark stories to tell.<br /><br />Minor spoilers below.<br /><br />When we meet the characters in the pilot, we think we know them, but when we see their flashbacks, we get the rug pulled out from under our feet, for no one is who they seem to be.  While about 48 people survived, only 14 are focused upon.  The 14 main castaways are: Jack (Matthew Fox), a heroic doctor, Kate (Evangeline Lilly), a shy girl who develops a crush on Jack, Charlie (Dominic Monaghan), a British rocker with a drug problem, Hurley (Jorge Garcia), a large man with a large heart, Jin (Daniel Dae Kim) and his wife Sun (Yujin Kim), a Korean couple who initially isolate themselves from the rest of the group, Claire (Emilie de Ravin), a pregnant Australian woman without a father for her unborn baby, Sawyer (Josh Holloway), a low-life who hoards the supplies from the wrecked plane so that he can barter them with the people who need them, Michael (Harold Perrineau) and his son Walt (Malcolm David Kelley), who have just been reunited after Walt's mother died, Boone (Ian Somerhalder) and his sister Shannon (Maggie Grace), who constantly bicker, Sayid (Naveen Andrews), an Iraqi who fought against the US in the Gulf War and is attacked due to racism, and finally Locke (Terry O'Quinn), a mysterious man who doesn't seem to mind being stuck on the island.  Of course, those are the characters that we think we meet in the pilot episodes.  The people that they truly are become revealed over the course of the season.<br /><br />In addition to learning about the castaways' pasts, their present situation is dealt with superbly as well.  In the first few episodes, they run out of food and water, and they have to figure out what to do.  Later on, they discover that they aren't alone on the island when Sayid meets Rousseau (Mira Furlan), a French woman who's been on the island for 16 years and claims that there are "Others" on the island who plot against her.  When mysterious things begin happening to the islanders, they begin to suspect that Rousseau is right.<br /><br />However, there are a fair share of miraculous events that occur that aren't the work of the Others.  I'm not going to spoil any of them, as they are too good to reveal in this review.  There are also plenty of mysteries on the island that keep both the characters and the audience perplexed.  What exactly do the others want?  What is the significance of the black and white rocks?  Why are there polar bears on a tropical island?  Where are they?<br /><br />This was an amazing season of television, and it ended with an amazing season finale that is keeping all of us begging for more.  This is a quality show worth checking out.  I will say that it is slightly overhyped, but Lost deserves a good 95% of the hype that it receives.  See you on the island...</p></body></html>

This film takes place over a period time.  It is not apparent from a first watch but you will notice this on a second look.  The screenplay was adapted from Patrick Marber's hit West End Play (I saw it in Los Angeles at the Mark Taper Forum.)<br /><br />Dan Wolf (Jude Law) is a wannabe writer who is currently writing obits.  One day he is walking down the street when American Alice Ayers (Natalie Portman) crosses the street and is hit by a taxi.  Dan rushes Anna to the hospital and this starts their relationship.<br /><br />Passage of time, Dan and Alice are now married.  Dan has written a book based on Alice.  He is sent to have his cover picture taken by Anna Cameron (Julia Roberts).  He has an instant connection with her but she resists because he is married.<br /><br />Passage of time, Dan is surfing in a chat room and pretends to be a woman.  He is chatting up Dr. Larry Bagley (Clive Owen) who is bored at work.  In the end, Larry asks to meet up.  Off the top of his head, Dan agrees to meet Larry at the Aquarium and tells him his name is Anna.<br /><br />Next day at the Aquarium, Larry finds Anna (she mentioned to Dan that the Aquarium is her favorite place to go and meditate.)  But of course, she has no idea what is going on.  That is until Larry tells her about the chat room.  Anna puts two and two together.  But she likes Larry, so no harm.<br /><br />Passage of time, Anna is having her first showing of her photographs at a gallery.  She has married Larry.  Dan and Alice show up.  While Dan is chatting up Anna, Larry is with Alice.<br /><br />Passage of time, Larry has returned from a medical convention to find Anna out of sorts.  It turns out that Dan and Anna have been having an affair ever since the showing.  Simultaneously, Alice finds out about the affair and leaves Dan.<br /><br />Passage of time, Larry has given into his baser desires and is now frequenting strip clubs and finds Anna performing.  He becomes fixated with her and tries to get her to go home with him but she is still in love with Dan. (This is Natalie's best scene.)<br /><br />Passage of time, Dan and Anna are on the outs and Dan confronts Larry.  Larry baits Dan and he leaves in a rage.  In the end, Anna returns to Larry but Dan is not so lucky.<br /><br />The final scene has Dan back at a park by the hospital where he took Anna and finds out one of her secrets.<br /><br />Mike Nichols is the one of the great directors who has not had a hit in years.  This definitely broke his dry spell.  This film had a definite edge but with a lesser director it would be tawdry, with Nichols it was perfection.<br /><br />Clive Owen received a long overdue Oscar nomination and should have won (but it was great to see Morgan Freeman finally get his recognition.)  Julia Roberts showed why she is the number one actress working.  Anna is an extremely complex character and she handled every scene with extreme talent.  This was Jude Law's year for roles (he had four films that year) but Dan is not a likeable character so he was greatly overlooked.  Natalie Portman also received an Oscar nomination for her deft work as the quintessential "other woman".<br /><br />This is not a film for the prudish or faint of heart.  This is an all out attack on your senses and a lovely attack.<br /><br />DVD EXTRAS: Music Video - The Blower's Daughter - Haunting in the film but does not stand up as a solo song.</p></body></html>

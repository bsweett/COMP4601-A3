Now that the origin of the superhero was narrated in the first "Spider-Man", the creative team was free to explore new elements of the abundant universe of the comic. In few words the story is better because they used more elements this time.<br /><br /> In "Spider-Man 2", Peter Parker is caught in a dilemma: he must use his powers or he must quit and resume his normal life? Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is a more developed character this time, she is Spidey's love interest, but she now wants to move on with or without Peter. Also Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) plays an important role in "Spider-Man 2", her dialogues are richer and her performance is tender and sweet, just like Aunt May in the comics.<br /><br /> This time Harry Osborn (James Franco) is more important than just a good friend, Harry presents another dilemma to Spidey. And the villain is a big improvement over the "Green Goblin", Willem Dafoe was great in the first movie, but Alfred Molina as "Doctor Octopus" is one of the best villains in a comic-based movie. "Spider-Man 2" covers much more ground than the first movie.<br /><br /> The special effects are very improved, still there are some effects that look like a videogame, but overall the visual and sound effects are convincing and help to built the action. By the way, this movie has the most incredible action sequences seen so far in a comic-based movie, the action is bigger and better.<br /><br /> The music is more dynamic in "Spider-Man 2", Danny Elfman used some of the old tracks, and added new ones. The cast and the director seem more comfortable in "Spider-Man 2". Kirsten looks better with her new hairstyle, she was the ideal girl next door in the first movie, but now she looks like the ideal Mary Jane Watson (Parker). Tobey Maguire is as reliable as always, Alfred Molina is outstanding as Doc Ock and the rest of the cast is very solid.<br /><br /> "Spider-Man 2" has a little bit of everything: it has action, drama, romance, comedy, good performances, great direction by Sam Raimi, outstanding visual and sound effects, and it's better than the first one. Can't wait for the DVD release.</p></body></html>

It's slick, funny, classy, and luxurient. I recently introduced my sister-in-law to it, and got to experience all the pleasure of my first viewing over again seeing her enjoyment. This movie made a star of Gene Tierney, and why not? She looks beautiful in every shot, and of course especially in that bewitching portrait that commands the living room of Laura's sumptuous apartment, the site of the inexplicable shotgun murder of Laura, the most sought after woman of her set.  The mood of the film is created by the wonderful narration of Waldo Lydecker (Clifton Webb), who recounts how he encountered an ambitious young woman whom he nurtured into a success, socially and professionally. The combination of his words and the accompanying glamour shots of Laura fix for the viewer the indelible image of a woman who transcends class. In contrast to Waldo's word paintings are the world-weary remarks of Mark MacPherson, the detective assigned to investigate Laura's murder, played by Dana Andrews. Though he appears to scoff at the imago of Laura created by Waldo, Mark is secretly seduced by it, aided by reading her private letters and handling her beautiful things in the apartment, and of course studying her portrait. Rounding out the cast are Judith Anderson as Laura's aunt Ann and Vincent Price as Shelby, Laura's on again off again fiance. The affair of these two suggest that things were not perfect in Laura's seemingly fairy tale life. And of course, like all good film noir murder mysteries, &quot;Laura&quot; has a riveting plot twist that makes you throw all your previous ideas out the window. One of the true film classics--you can't go wrong with this one. ....</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="OK Thriller with Michael Douglas as Veteran Agent, and Kim Basinger as The First Lady"></head><body><p>It was a kind of surprise that Hollywood still keeps making a political thriller about the criminals engineering a conspiracy to kill the VIPs, and a super-human agent who almost single-handedly fights it. Luckily `The Sentinel' is a reasonably entertaining if not original thriller, far better than other flops like `Shadow Conspiracy.' Director Clark Johnson (`S.W.A.T') keeps the ball rolling, and the pace is fast enough to make us forget the countless plot holes and implausible motives of the characters.<br /><br />Michael Douglas plays Pete Garrison, veteran secret service agent who once saved the life of President Ronald Reagan. After one of his colleagues gets killed, an informer reaches him, telling him that there is another assassination plan that is going on.<br /><br />Well, I can go on writing about the convoluted story, but maybe I shouldn't. There is an ex-best friend (and agent) played by Kiefer Sutherland in his `24' mood and he still wouldn't agree to bury the hatchet with Pete. There is a new recruit Eva Longoria in tailored suit who has not much to do in the story. Those who know something about the political thrillers can predict what will happen to each character, perhaps except one love affair involving the First Lady played by Kim Basinger, but that part looks sometimes out of place (partly because they altered the original book's story, which is more surprising).<br /><br />But the film itself is not bad. It keeps good pace, and the cast especially the lead Michael Douglas did a fine job. Usually I am not much interested in the assassination story - not because it is implausible, but too many films did that, didn't they? - but `The Sentinel' has a good rhythm that barely covers the impossibilities of the story.</p></body></html>

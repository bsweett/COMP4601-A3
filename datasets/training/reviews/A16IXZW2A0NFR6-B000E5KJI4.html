<meta name="summary" content="Ancient Battles Gap Style"></head><body><p>This movie really has one major flaw...which would be prettified blonde Gap ad Brad Pitt. I've liked him in other movies in the past but here he just seems lost in his character and overwhemed by the stories scope. Eric Bana makes this movie watchable, I feel bad for him for ending up in flops like this and The Hulk because he is actually a decent actor. Orlando Bloom whines like a 3 year old girl the entire film and proves he has little resonace onscreen when he actually has to speak. The cinemotography is excellent and the rest of the supporting cast is good, but there still isn't anything too memorable going on here, this movie could have been a whole lot better, but it could also have been worse.</p></body></html>

He lived a full and wonderful life, and his cinematic legacy covers all genres.  Check out this partial lineup from just the 1960s-WEST SIDE STORY, TWO FOR THE SEESAW, THE HAUNTING, THE SOUND OF MUSIC, THE SAND PEBBLES, and STAR!  Wise started out as an editor at RKO.  He edited CITIZEN KANE and (re)edited THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS for Orson Welles in the early 1940s, then directed one of the scariest of the Val Lewton psychological chillers:  THE BODY SNATCHER (1945) and a great boxing drama called THE SET-UP (1947).<br /><br />Wise's most famous film is probably the Oscar-winning Best Picture and Director winner, THE SOUND OF MUSIC (1965, Fox).  It and WEST SIDE STORY were what came to my mind first when I heard he was dead.  I was going to single out a less well-known Wise film for review here until I took an informal poll and found that a startling number of friends and business associates on my e-mail distribution list had never seen THE SOUND OF MUSIC uncut and non-commercial anywhere-theater or home video--, just parts of it butchered and with commercials on NBC or ABC.  So I recommend watching a studio print of THE SOUND OF MUSIC on deluxe double DVD to salute a great and incredibly versatile filmmaker.<br /><br />MUSIC was first a real-life drama, then a 1950's play by Howard Lindsay and Russel Crouse with Mary Martin and songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein, then an enormously popular Best Picture Oscar winner in the mid-1960's.  It is about the courageous Von Trapp family trying to live with the Nazi occupation of Austria in 1938 Salzburg, then later attempting to flee the country as professional singers.  Christopher Plummer plays the widowed Captain with seven children; Julie Andrews got an Oscar nomination (one year after winning the award for MARY POPPINS) as nun Maria who is much too independent to ever be whatever comes next for a nun.  During a night storm, she teaches the kids "Raindrops On Roses"-until she is interrupted by a drenched Liesl (Charmian Carr), oldest of the children, who has been in the moonlit yard gazebo singing "Sixteen Going on Seventeen" with young Nazi messenger Rolfe (Daniel Truhitte).<br /><br />MUSIC was filmed all over Salzburg.  Bike riding around the town in olive and white window curtain clothes, climaxes with "Do Re Mi" on top of a beautiful mountain.  Shortly thereafter, the Captain is furious to learn that his kids have been wandering all over the town in bedsheets, albeit having a wonderful time.  But his anger is calmed when his fiancee, Baroness Eleanor Parker, finds the kids charming.  Meanwhile, Maria is slowly falling in love with the Captain, and he with her.  There is a fun puppet show, which is often cut for time on TV.  The kids and the Captain all sing the lovely  "Edelweiss" to the Baroness and show biz manager Max (Richard Haydn).  But during a lavish party, Maria leaves the mansion with a goodbye note for the Captain.  Intermission.  We are about 100 minutes into a 174 minute movie that has restored roadshow music and intermission on DVD.<br /><br />I have seen THE SOUND OF MUSIC on stage, and it just dies, despite the wonderful songs and competent actors, because of painted backdrops for the town and Alpine mountain meadows.  By contrast, this Robert Wise movie (scripted by Ernest Lehman) is a masterpiece with dream casting to match the incomparable songs.  After the intermission, Maria returns and the unhappy kids come to life again.  The Baroness realizes that the Captain is in love with Maria and fades into the background; Parker is wonderful in this role.  The Captain and Maria have a romantic duet "I Must Have Done Something Good" in the moonlit gazebo; so do Liesl and Rolfe, which is tricky because an Austrian girl is romancing a Nazi, who becomes a villain in the last half hour.<br /><br />The Von Trapp family and Maria have to flee a country plagued by insidious Nazis.  But first the Captain and Maria get married, in a cathedral with grand music.  Maria got permission from the Mother Superior (Peggy Wood), who gets to do "Climb Ev'ry Mountain" for Maria in her church office.  The big climax to the movie is a performance of "So Long, Farewell" and "Edelweiss" for a packed audience in a theater that has Nazis taking up the entire first row and guarding the exits.  But you know this movie has a happy ending, or else it would get booed!  A gripping night graveyard scene leads to an enthralling finale that gives me goosebumps every time I see it.  The movie won five Oscars and was nominated for several more.<br /><br />Do yourselves a favor.  THE SOUND OF MUSIC, again, runs 174 minutes and is usually cut to 145 minutes for showing on commercial TV.  Trust me, this show needs to run a full three hours.  It does NOT have half an hour of dead material!  You can buy a bonus-free studio print DVD for $10, or the super-duper Five Star Collection for about $30.  (It looks like this one is on temporary moratorium so that Fox can bring out a 40th Anniversary edition soon.)  The more expensive edition belongs in every family.  Among its exhausting bonuses are audio commentary by producer-director Wise (who wisely keeps quiet during the songs), an extensive 87 minute filmmaking documentary, Charmian Carr's home movies as Liesl, a congratulations telegram from Dan Truhitte (Rolfe), a 36 minute 1965 documentary on the beauty of Salzburg, audio comments by writer Ernest Lehman and Julie Andrews, and what seems like someone's uncut dissertation.  It ran several hours (!) for me and is self-generated with arrows you push at your own speed, documenting the history of the Von Trapp family, the creation and production of the 1950's play, pre-production through post-production almost day by day for the movie, and what the family has been up to since the movie.<br /><br />This is one stupendous DVD, which also gives you a THX-mastered soundtrack and the original widescreen aspect ratio (so you can see all of the children and all of the outdoor scenery at once).  Man, I love this immortal screen classic!  I find it unimaginable that people exist on planet Earth who have never seen THE SOUND OF MUSIC in a theater or uncut and non-commercial somewhere else somehow.  For Heaven's sake, treat yourselves, on a birthday or anniversary-or Robert Wise's death, to one of Hollywood's greatest musicals with the Five Star Collection of the movie on DVD. Or the upcoming edition.</p></body></html>

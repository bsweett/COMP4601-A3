<meta name="summary" content="We're going to need a bigger DVD"></head><body><p>Jaws is one of the few films that surpasses the novel from which it sprang.  Jaws is a very simple film, without the convoluted side-stories of the book.  A man-eating shark lurks off the beaches of a small island that depends on tourist dollars.  Three men set off in a boat to hunt down and kill the shark, but the sheer size of the animal makes it a struggle for survival.  The film works wonderfully, and is filled with great performances, great filming, and sure direction from Steven Spielberg.  <p>The film doesn't get the credit it deserves, in my opinion.  This is likely because it spawned a number of cut-rate sequels and imitators.  The filming and effects are superb, even by today's standards.  It is well-known that the mechanical shark did not work for most of the shoot, forcing Spielberg to film as a thriller where the shark is only glimpsed most of the time.  In fact, the film benefits from this method because by the time you actually see the shark, you are so immersed in the story that you don't notice the effect.<p>The human performances are consistently good.  The trio at the heart of the action are well cast and have great on-screen chemistry.  The supporting actors are also good.  The photography, much of it on the sea, gives a feeling of menace (beneath the waves) and isolation (one ship on the vast ocean).  And, of course, John William's Oscar-winning soundtrack is a masterpiece of mood.<p>Unfortunately, this DVD is not enough!  The picture and sound are as good as expected.  There is an hour-long documentary on the making of Jaws that is fun and informative.  However....  where's the director's commentary?  A film with as storied a history as this surely deserves a commentary from Spielberg and/or the producers.  There are a couple of cut scenes and outtakes on the disc, but they only fuel a desire for more, especially since the documentary has a number of clips that are not in the film or in the extra material on the DVD.  Therefore, I look forward to an even better DVD sometime in the future.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Just a train out of control"></head><body><p>Unlike his previous train movie ("Pelham 123"), Denzel Washington gets to drive the train this time.  Based on a real life incident, a mile long freight train carrying toxic chemicals is turned loose - by accident not terrorists - across the Pennsylvania countryside.  Frank (Washington) and Will (Chris Pine), become reluctant heroes who get stuck on the same track.  The film is the right length (98 min.) and has the right plot.  That is, not much of one.  Just the train hauling ass across the state.  Not much sidetracks the action.  Just how it happened, how can it be fixed and can it be done in an hour and a half.  Granted there's nothing of heft here, just thrills.  Yes, there are a few too many police cars showing up in critical scenes and one too many car crashes, but I sure liked the 70 mph locomotive demolishing things that get stuck on the track.  Plenty-o-fun.<br /><br />This is a solid Blu ray transfer with excellent detail and a vibrant (and loud) surround application.</p></body></html>

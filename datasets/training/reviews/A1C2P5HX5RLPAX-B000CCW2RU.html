Everyone wears the same uniform and everyone has a specific job although they don't know the purpose of their jobs. There is a lottery to go to an island get away and all members look forward to this. What do they don't know is that the lottery winners coincide with policy holders needing a body part and that they are the prize.<br /><br />We both liked this futuristic action about a society of clones who live under ground without knowing who they are. Two of them learn that they are being grown for their body parts for the original host (who thinks they are vegetables) and escape into the outside world to let the real world know what's going on underground.<br /><br />Beautifully choreographed actions scenes, a good script and a great team of actors help pull off this movie that is somewhat reminiscent to the 70s cult classic Logan's Run. The Island raises the obvious question about how far we should go in cloning research and whether a line must be drawn, where, and just who gets to pick up the pen. I highly recommend this film for its entertainment value and thought provoking innuendo. Reviewed by M. E. Wood.</p></body></html>

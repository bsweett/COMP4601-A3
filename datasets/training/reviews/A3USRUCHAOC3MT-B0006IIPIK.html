The movie was made with a blue screen, and the backgrounds were added.  They could have chosen to give a totally surreal feel to it as you have with the Batman series or "Dick Tracy", but it fit the setting perfectly.<br /><br />I would call this the 2000 attempt of "Raiders Of The Lost Ark".  There are many similarities between the two pictures, such as the time setting, the homage to 40's serials, the action, having a foreign sidekick, one graphic horrific death scene toward the end, and even having some of the action in Nepal.  This movie also borrowed from other action movies including Jurassic Park.<br /><br />This movie was very well done, but I actually didn't like it.  A movie like that is of course a time waster, but this one made me feel the time was wasted.<br /><br />One drawback is that the target audience seems to be an under thirty viewer who enjoys 40's movies.  This movie captures the 40's films even more effectively than Raiders, and that may be its undoing.  For this person who is more at home in the '70's and '80's, I found this movie in some ways before my time and in other ways after my time.</p></body></html>

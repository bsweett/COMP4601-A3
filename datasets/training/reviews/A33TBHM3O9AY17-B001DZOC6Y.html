I have been duly unimpressed with some of his earlier efforts, but this one takes the proverbial cake.  Bad acting, a bad storyline, an anemic cast, and a heavy dose of left-wing eco-propaganda all combine to make this an eminently forgettable story -- except for the indelible scar that it has left on my beleaguered psyche.  There's really no need to say much more.  Other reviewers have already told more than we really need to know.  In an effort to set this one in proper context, however, I will conclude by noting that "Plan 9 From Outer Space" has found a soulmate.</p></body></html>

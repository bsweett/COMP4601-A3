<meta name="summary" content="Very good ghost story movie"></head><body><p>I just finished watching this movie after renting it tonight.  Time to review it.<br /><br />This movie was recommended to me by my friend here on Amazon, Brian Nallick ("Metalman Minnesota").  Thanks Brian.<br /><br />I don't want to go into a summary of the plot, etc. because there are 743 reviews already written.  I just want to say a few things.<br /><br />I had heard a lot about this movie over the years, but had never seen it until tonight.  It's definitely a movie that is right up my alley - a haunted house/ghost story that relies on atmosphere and psychological horror and suspense rather than CGI, blood, gore, and anything and everything that is obvious.  This movie is often compared to The Innocents (1961).  The stories are at least loosely similar and certain scenes look alike in both movies.  In my opinion, The Others isn't quite as good as The Innocents, but it's definitely up there with the best haunted house/ghost story movies ever made.  Nicole Kidman does some great acting.  I think The Innocents has a spookier and more haunting atmosphere, but The Others has a lot of spooky moments as well.  Check out the outdoor scenes in the fog and at night.  The dim lighting throughout much of the movie really works (of course, the children need to be protected from the light).  The era that this movie takes place in is immediately after World War II, whereas The Innocents takes place in the nineteenth century.<br /><br />Overall, The Others is a fine film that definitely deserves the praise it has gotten over the years.  I highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

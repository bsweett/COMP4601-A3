The movie has a great feel and fantastic flow of plots and subplots. Call it a thriller but not a puzzle muzzle like the "Saw" series<br /><br />Charles Schine (Clive Owen) has a so-called chance train meeting with the very lovely Lucinda Harris. (Jennifer Aniston) Both are married but succumb to temptation. But the mirror image is not what it seems. Catch a glimpse into happenstance.<br /><br />The plot thickens as an unexpected encounter is interrupted by would be robber Phillipe LaRouche. (Vincent Cassel) LaRouche takes what him wants and then leaves. But is LaRouche satisfied with want he got? Of course money is the root of all evil. Blackmail is a powerful tool for keeping secrets. Is paying the ransom Charles's only option?<br /><br />This DVD is worth a look or two. Maybe a purchase if you're a fan of Jennifer Aniston or Clive Owen.</p></body></html>

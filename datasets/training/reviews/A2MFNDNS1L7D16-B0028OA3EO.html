First of all the physical resemblance of Brandon Routh to Reeve is striking. Second, neither of them can act. So what? That doesn't prevent either of these movies from being near great. Let's conveniently forget about 3. You once again have an over-the-top Lex Luther. Kevin Spacey v Gene Hackman? Not bad. So, nobody has seen Superman or Clark for five years. He just left. Superman was chasing a hunk of his home planet Krypton hurtling through the universe. Clark? Who missed him? Maybe Jimmy. He returns as if nothing had happened to resume his old job. Lois now has a son, also five years old. She must have hooked up, very quickly apparently, with a math whiz who can't add months & the kid calls him dad. That's the hook for the next chapter. Kevin Spacey is eating every scene he's in. He is creating a new continent off the shore of North America & billions will die. His girl friend, Kitty has a thing for Superman & talk about deja'vu. Anyway, Superman is again saved from deadly green kryptonite. Lex Luther is not killed. He is very much alive & free. I've left out the details, of course. They can make 10 more of these if they like just don't change Superman like they do Batman with every new movie. Brandon Routh is fine & Kevin Spacey is great. The rest of the cast is interchangable. Hardcore fans have probably already seen this one. Its been out for a while. I expect there will be a double disc dvd to look forward to in time for Christmas.</p></body></html>

It really starts off with a bang, much like the previous film.  The ending however was a little flat for me.  It was more subtle and made you think, but I did not feel satisfied by the conclusion.  It will probably be debated like the Sopranos ending, with a number of people thinking it is genius and others not liking it at all.  I will say that this is an interesting character study, well directed, and great acting all around.  Viggo is absolutely terrific in his role.  You would swear he is Russian.  The violence when it comes is very brutal.  This story of the Russian mob in London is not pretty and it might not be to everyone's taste.  Besides the murders, you have theft, prostitution, drugs and many other crimes.  I think this is a terrific movie to see and own.</p></body></html>

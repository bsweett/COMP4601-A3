<meta name="summary" content="Fantastic and fascinating... slow, deliberate, contemplative..."></head><body><p>As the title implies, many words can be used to describe this movie, including slow (not in a bad way at all), deliberate (in a very good way), contemplative, and more.  Fantastic and fascinating also.<br /><br />Letters from Iwo Jima gives those that watch the film the view from the other side of the battle at Iwo Jima, the side that most U.S. citizens (and other persons not of Asian descent) would likely not be aware of.  Clint Eastwood did this film as a companion piece to his much lauded film Flags of Our Fathers.  Flags is a look at the heroes of Iwo Jima.  I won't go into details about that film other than to say once you've seen it you realize that looking at Flags as a film about heroes is not what you wind up left with at the end.  Watch that film and you'll know what I'm referring to.<br /><br />Flags was a telling of the U.S. and Allied side of the events that happened on Iwo Jima, but also much more, including a good long look at the lives of the people that were fighters at Iwo Jima once those people had returned to the U.S. mainland.  While Flags doesn't demonize the Japanese military that was fighting the U.S. and allied forces at Iwo, it doesn't give any real details into the experiences of the other side.<br /><br />Letters gives us a long look into the Japanese military personnnel that served at Iwo Jima.  We get to see how they prepared for the inevitable battle, and how the people on the island faced a destiny they weren't necessarily happy to have to meet.  While many U.S. citizens may think of the Japanese soldiers in terms of willing to fight to the death and gladly lay down their lives in honor of their emperor, the soldiers that served at Iwo were not necessarily people that wanted to do that.  They had family to think of, had home lives they longed to return to, and had been left with little resources and logistical support as they became the last line of defense against U.S. Naval power on the way to the Japanese homeland.<br /><br />As another reviewer notes in their comments, the vast majority of the dialogue for the soundtrack for this film is in Japanese.  Viewers will most likely be watching this film with subtitles on constantly, with those subtitles in U.S. English translating the dialogue and providing the story for those viewers to understand (without having to learn Japanese first ;-) )  Unlike the reviewer that complained about the pacing of the subtitles, I had no issue with how long they were shown on the screen as the conversations flowed.  There was plenty of time to read the subtitle and also take in the images that were shown, and the subtitles weren't distracting for me at all.<br /><br />Though this film is a companion to Flags of Our Fathers, personally I believe this is the better film, and I would note that you really don't need to see either film in order to enjoy or appreciate the other.  Further, I would have to say that perhaps using the word 'enjoy' here is not quite appropriate.  Letters isn't a film that will bring joy for most viewers.  It's not a depressing film, but it's also not an uplifting film.  It documents, in a documentarian style, the events that happened at Iwo Jima, mostly from the Japanese side, and does so without glorifying or villifying war and it's participants.<br /><br />Letters is, in my opinion, a master work and is well worth owning for me.  While it may not be a film that viewers would want to see more than once or twice, it most certainly should be viewed at least once, and somewhat savored for the fine film that it is.<br /><br />One last comment here, relating to the film style used.  If you watch the film on HD DVD (or perhaps Blu-ray) you may feel somewhat offput by the grainy feel of the image used in many places on the film.  That look is intentional and really seems appropriate (to me) for this film.  That look may bother some, but I think it works well as it's used here.</p></body></html>

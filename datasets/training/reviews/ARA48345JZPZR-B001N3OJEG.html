It is now one of the great, classic moments of recent cinema.  <p>Prior to that moment, Curtis Hanson and company had set the scene, believably and meticulously established the time and place (LA/Hollywood early 50's), delineated the main characters and given us a mystery within a mystery.  This was done with patience and care.  (And an overdue antidote to the sacharine view of the 1950's).<p>After that moment, the momentum and pace pickup and everything starts rolling as all the pieces begin to fall into place and we learn with our lead characters the thread that has tied all these disparate elements together, all leading to a helluva climax with one of the best shootouts ever staged.<p>I love this movie.  It truly does rank with Chinatown in the pantheon of all-time great modern noir mysteries.  There isn't a facet of filmaking that was missed or fudged in making this.  It is first rate in all departments (cast, cinematography, script, dialogue, set design, costume etc.).  Too bad it got lost in the phenomena of Titanic.<p>Anyway, like Chinatown, there isn't a thing I would change about this movie.  It's as close to perfect as you're going to get.  A true modern Classic.</p></body></html>

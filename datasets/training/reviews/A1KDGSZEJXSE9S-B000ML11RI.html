<meta name="summary" content="really good"></head><body><p>Just one step below great... The visuals are awesome of course<br /><br />and so is the acting. Bruce Willis is a cop that just can't come<br /><br />to terms with the fact that he is aging and is just about out<br /><br />of the game.<br /><br />It's an action packed and gory thrill ride. Yes, it's a comic<br /><br />book thing, but you believe in the characters and they feel<br /><br />real. All three stories manage to keep your interested through<br /><br />out the entire two hours. Out of all the stories I'd say<br /><br />Mickey Rourke is my favorite as the beastly looking man out<br /><br />to get revenge for the men that killed his hooker girlfriend.<br /><br />It's rare to have a movie be really good eye candy and actually<br /><br />good at the sametime. Either a movie has a good story and lacks<br /><br />action, or it has good action and lacks any kind of story.<br /><br />Btw, Rosario Dawson is hot in this one! And Bruce Willis seems<br /><br />to be getting it back together alittle bit with his solid B<br /><br />movie Hostage and now this.</p></body></html>

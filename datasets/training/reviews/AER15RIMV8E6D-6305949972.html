<meta name="summary" content="A Film For All Goths & Emos!!!"></head><body><p>If you are a goth or emo kid, I'm sure you've seen this hundreds of times! But, I'm not here to bash goth kids, I'm here to review this film. It's a pretty good movie. I don't love it, but I like it. I do love the 'This is HALLOWEEN' song, and the revamped version done by Marilyn Manson. It's awesome that they combine HALLOWEEN and Christmas. In case you are new to the world of Tim Burton's depressing gothic/emo films, I'll give a brief synopsis; Jack Skellington is the King of HALLOWEEN Town, and he is getting tired of it. After the HALLOWEEN bash, he accidentally stumbles into Christmas Town and wants to bring it all back to his world. The creatures of HALLOWEEN Town begin to help Jack with his dream. Will Jack's dream go the way he plans? Can he save Santa Claus from Oogie Boogie. If you are a goth/emo kid, love HALLOWEEN, and Christmas, you'll love THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS!!!</p></body></html>

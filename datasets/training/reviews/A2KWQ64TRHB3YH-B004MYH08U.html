<meta name="summary" content="This is somewhat silly"></head><body><p>This film is a non-traditional version of the Green Hornet and is somewhat silly. The Green Hornet is a slightly overweight rich boy who was a playboy doing silly things. When his father dies, he pals up with his father's servant who made coffee for him, and decides to engage in even more difficult pranks, to become a better gangster than anyone else. His side kick is an expert at hand to hand combat, but the Green Hornet is little more than a bumbling fool. Thus, he is not a savior, but a foolish gangster.</p></body></html>

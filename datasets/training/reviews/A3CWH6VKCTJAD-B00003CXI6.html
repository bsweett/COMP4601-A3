<meta name="summary" content="An excellent supernatural suspense thriller"></head><body><p>Robert Zemeckis has made a career out of melding excellent stories with great visual effects ("Who Framed Roger Rabbit", "Back to the Future", "Forrest Gump").  He is a very versatile director who can adeptly shift from genre to genre.  In this film, he again demonstrates his talent, creating a spooky supernatural thriller delivering some of the best suspense I've seen in years.<p>The story by Sarah Kernochan ("9 ? Weeks", "Sommersby") where the dead victim communicates with someone living to finger the killer is not innovative and has been done numerous times in various forms.  What makes this film good is Zemeckis' presentation.  It has elements of Hitchcock suspense with the benefit of modern technology and visual effects.  Zemeckis' use of camera and sound produces extraordinary suspense and startling surprises that make viewers jump out of their seats.  There is a lot of silence in this film with no background music which makes the surprises that much more dramatic.  He peppers the film with false alarms so you never know if the buildup is for something genuinely scary or just the dog.  Though none of the techniques is new, they are all used extremely effectively.  The film creates terror with very little gore and violence, proving that the use of these techniques in horror films is overdone and unnecessary.  Often what we don't see is far more frightening than what we do.<p>The acting in this film is outstanding.  Michelle Pfeiffer gives a brilliant performance as Claire; the overwrought wife who everyone thinks is losing her mind when she starts talking about communing with the dead.  Pfeiffer takes her character right to the edge and her hysterical fear at the events that transpire is awesome.  Harrison Ford plays an unaccustomed role, departing from his normal white hat hero.  He shows great range by handling the sinister aspects of his character nefariously.  Diana Scarwid also gives an enjoyable performance as Claire's best friend.<p>Though this film doesn't redefine the genre, it is a fine example of frightening suspense under the guidance of a talented director.  I rated it an 8/10.  Be prepared for a heart pounding experience.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the better movies based on a Stephen King story"></head><body><p>1408 is a well made ghost story with John Cusack as a writer who wants to write a story about a motel room that many people have died in. He actually stays in the room expecting it to be not that bad since he has stayed at haunted places in the past. Samuel L. Jackson is great as the motel manager eventhough he's short and white in the short story I think but while reading it, I pictured Samuel L. Jackson anyway. Samuel L. Jackson adds more humor and sarcasm to the part though. Anyway he's both creepy and funny in the small part as he practically begs Cusack not to stay in 1408 adding some hilarious Samuel L. Jackson style curse words. Soon after arriving in 1408 Cusack realizes that 1408 is the real deal and as much as he'd like to leave the room won't let him.<br /><br />  The ghosts in 1408 can look like prejections from the Haunted House in Disney World, so they aren't that scary. But there's still pleanty of moments in the movie that will make you jump. The movie is also very entertaining but mostly due to the great work from John Cusack. He can make you laugh pleanty of times but the movie can also have it's emotional scenes which he handles fine as well. I admit there's a scene at the end where he had me close to tears. Despite some scares, the movie really wouldn't have been as good without him.<br /><br />  Even if you read the story, there's no one else you can picture who's as perfect for the part. If you're not sure what Stephen King book you can find the story in, it's in Everything's Eventual by the way. I still have to finish it, I started reading this week before I saw the movie. I'll have to see if the ending is the same but here I really liked it a lot. The movie is worth checking out, that is if you're not expecting a whole lot of blood and guts and just want to see a movie with a good story.</p></body></html>

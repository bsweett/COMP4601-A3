<meta name="summary" content="Wrong director for a movie-worthy book."></head><body><p>I liked the "DaVinci Code", and considered its premise intriguing.  I didn't rush out and debate it at the water cooler, didn't consult my priest, didn't go crazy and buy everything Dan Brown had written (most of it workmanlike, but not noteworthy!).  I reread it a couple of weeks ago to refamiliarize myself for the movie, and liked it a little better.  I think Dan Brown wrote it with the screen in mind.<br /><br />The controversy around the world based on first the book and then the movie amuses me.  Brown raises some age-old religious fables which have an element of believable truth in them.  If you are a Christian, and especially if you are Catholic, you should be more concerned about the political machinations for hundreds of years of a faith trying to cover up its less than savory origins, and not so much about all the details of how Jesus lived.  And no matter who you are, please keep in mind, THIS IS A WORK OF FICTION.<br /><br />So I decided to put to the side all the controversy over the film in the review and simply focus on the film itself.  I would have liked the film's director to do that as well, and to make the film as art, without regard to worldwide events.  But,<br /><br />as usual, Ron Howard avoided controversy.  Like in the film, "A Beautiful Mind" where he avoided the homosexuality and abusiveness of his main character, and in "Cinderella Man" where he avoided the corruption in the fight industry, Howard plays to the mainstream.<br /><br />The DaVinci Code deserved another director.  For one thing, without Howard, there would probably have been no Tom Hanks.  Hanks can be an actor without peer (Philadelphia), but the hero of this book had to be passionate about his belief in the finding of the Holy Grail, and torn in his decision on whether to reveal it.  Hanks is of an age and of a look where he needs to step up to the roles of older men.<br /><br />Writer Akiva Goldman chose in the script to write Langdon as a skeptic, and Hanks conveyed it, without managing to generate any heat for Sophie's (Audrey Tautou) character.  Who better - Hugh Jackman?  Sean Penn?  Adrien Brody?  Nicholas Cage?  Certainly I would have rather seen Langdon played with the quirky characteristics that a "symbologist" must have, given their careers.<br /><br />I felt the rest of the cast played true, especially Ian McKellan as Sir Leigh Teague.  McKellan sparkled, and the film came alive for awhile when he first came on the screen.  The problem is the blending of the cast, eliciting both individually great performances and ensemble mentality; Howard failed here, and the results make the audience restless.  He has done this fine blending once or twice in the past, but he is usually more concerned about the visual quality of the film (DaVinci was stunning) and the concepts...whether to use flashback and CSI (both are quietly stunning in this film) and steering clear of controversy. It's a shame, when he always manages to put a cast of fine actors together.<br /><br />My main complaint is that DaVinci should have been a thriller.  Maybe it is difficult to brink an important contemporary novel to the screen and elicit the pace and the emotion that makes a good thriller.  Somebody better tell Clint Eastwood that...his "Mystic River" was far superior to Howard's effort here, and he would have been a better choice to direct.<br /><br />The film was visually stunning and the content adequate.  Nothing more.</p></body></html>

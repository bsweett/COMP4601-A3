<meta name="summary" content="The Criterion edition is the best."></head><body><p>I was lucky enough to buy my store's last copy of the Criterion Collection version of "Silence of the Lambs," which features, most notably, a commentary track featuring director Jonathan Demme, actors Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins. This is, arguably, the best commentary track ever placed aside a grand film. None of the other DVDs have this feature.<p>If you can find this anywhere, grab it.<p>Foster talks about how she was intrigued by the feminist aspect of the role of Clarice Starling. An FBI agent who served as a consultant on the film chimes in with tales of true gore and how the film fared in its portrayal of FBI training. And Hopkins speaks of how he makes Lecter both endearing and creepy.<p>The movie itself looks great, still causes a chill and a thrill. But the commentary is to die for.</p></body></html>

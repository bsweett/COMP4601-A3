<meta name="summary" content="there are two over self-righteous male s-pigs in this movie"></head><body><p>these two men in this particular movie are so self-righteous, vicious, selfish, egoistic. they can do whatever they want, what they do immorally wrong, they still can find excuses to justify themselves, but won't allow or tolerate the women to do anything similar to their wrong doings. why making love, climax or whatsoever sex issues are so important to these two egoists are just beyond my malewise comprehension. these two men only express their love by mouth, giving lip service all the time, pretend to be candid to their woman again and again, claiming themselves with a conscience and moral standard. force woman to become his own property, only he can abuse her constantly. while maintaining their superfluous love to one woman, they are also looking for newly found free chow around them. julia roberts is not a good choice for the role she played. she gave a remote possibility of being that kind of woman in this movie. not in the least convincingly true as a woman who's even remotely interested in sex. the young actress who grew up from her kiddy role in 'the professional', now turned out to be a great actress, bless her.<br /><br />both male actors are also good, but both got duck-like walking problem. good directing too. only the editing a bit too jumpy. that's all folks! agree or not agree is never my concern. none whatsoever.</p></body></html>

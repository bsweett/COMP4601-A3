<meta name="summary" content="Destined, I believe to become Christmas- time perennial."></head><body><p>It has as much to do with Christmas as Home Alone, The Bishop'a Wife & other holiday fare.<br />  Here's the deal: You meet somone new during the holidays. It is the perfect 1st date movie. It's about love, but totally non-threatening. If the two of you last, it is a movie to revisit year after year. It's already in dvd to take home (complete with a 9-11 reference to date it forever).<br />  Christmas in London. About a dozen different love stories  somehow intertwined with each other. Stangely, in these times, no overtly gay love stories.<br />  A feel good movie that can be viewed by anyone.<br />Lots of recognizible stars in a very large, loveable cast. The scenes of modern day London are terrific. Merry Christmas!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="a mediocre screenplay with a mis-casting actor"></head><body><p>if compares to the original fascinating 'point of impact' by stephen hunter, this 'shooter' is a failure, not just the screenplay but also the hero casting. m.w,'s image is totally different from what we have visualized 'bob lee swagger' should be. even you didn't read the first 'swagger' series, you would not feel thrilled by the choice of m.w., because he's absolutely not 'swagger' should look like and act like. added up by a somewhat messy screenplay and other badly casting supporting roles, this movie is a far-cry from what we wish to be produced. i was kinda heart-broken when i found out that the great series was totally ruined by this mediocre movie and those hollywood stereotyped explosions. better check with the marines to see if they know how to get ready-made stuff from a hardware store to make pipe bombs so powerful. i seem to remember that 'point of impact' is a very lethal but also very quiet novel, where those explosions come from?</p></body></html>

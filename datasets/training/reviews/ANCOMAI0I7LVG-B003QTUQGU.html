Seriously, if you read the review I wrote for Disney's animated version of `Alice in Wonderland' I said that Tim Burton needed to make this a live action film.  I was salivating over the idea.  When my dreams came true I was ecstatic.  I just knew that this film would be everything I hoped it would be and then, well, it wasn't.<br /><br />It really, REALLY wasn't.<br /><br />First off, everyone and their mother needs to be forewarned that this film is NOT a direct adaptation of the classic original we all know and love.  That isn't to say that this isn't pulled from Lewis Carroll's books, it is just that it doesn't follow the animated classic we all have grown up loving.  This film follows an older Alice who has just been proposed to by a nasty young man.  She flees the scene of the proposal and falls down the rabbit hole once again except she can't remember anything from before (although she does recall some lost memories she assumes are part of a recurring dream) and so she does a lot of repeat work (I assume in an effort to draw on the nostalgia of it all) before she uncovers the reality of why she is where she is.  She has to help overthrow the Red Queen by defeating some dragon creature so that the White Queen can take her rightful place on the throne.<br /><br />Thank god for Helena Bonham-Carter.<br /><br />Ok, so let's be honest here.  This film is a total mess.  The issue here is that Burton doesn't know how to edit himself.  He throws so much at you, assuming that more is more when in actuality, it's a freakish overkill.  `Alice in Wonderland' is a trashcan filled to the brim with a months worth of leftovers that spills out onto every frame.  From the overload of colorful set pieces that just overtakes every scene to the nightmarish performance by Johnny Depp, this film is garish to an extreme.  The plotting is underwhelming.  In reading Tim Burton's take on the film, he had mentioned being unmoved and emotionally disconnected to the actual flow of the books and the original films.  He said that he wanted to create a human element here, but he lost the whole point of the tale and instead shoved a generically clich&eacute;d `formula' at us and called it UNDERLAND.<br /><br />I won't say that the visuals are bad because they are not.  In many instances they are slick and exciting, but there are just TOO MANY OF THEM.  This film is far too loud.  Sure, some may say that the point of this film is to be loud, and to an extent they are right, but this film doesn't carry the right visual feel.  This film feels forced and unfocused.  Far too much (FAR TOO MUCH) attention was given to creating dreamlike set pieces that cross the line of `tasteful' into `tacky', and far too little attention was given to fleshing out the childlike curiosity that embodied the original.<br /><br />Burton didn't `get it' and so his take on the story doesn't `get it'.<br /><br />The less said about Johnny Depp's embarrassing portrayal of The Mad Hatter the better.  Why won't he just go away?<br /><br />In the end, there are two things worth mentioning here.  The score is on one hand rather loud and forbearing but it is also appropriately used and beautiful in its own right.  Also, Helena Bonham-Carter is BRILLIANT here.  I really think she needs to divorce (at least professionally) Tim Burton and solely work with other directors, but it is apparent that her talent was needed here since she livens her every scene and creates an unforgettable presence in The Red Queen.<br /><br />She's magnificent.<br /><br />Skip this trash heap, seriously.</p></body></html>

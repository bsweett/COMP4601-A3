<meta name="summary" content="No!  Do not see this stinkfest!"></head><body><p>For the love of all things sacred, please do not go and see this one!  It will make you cry with all the passion in your body.  Do not forget how bad Sly's television program and magazine were!  They failed horrendously!  This movie will sink to the bottom of the sea!  I promise you!<br /><br />This is the only movie I know that won an Oscar, yet has nearly as many sequels as the Friday the 13th franchise.  Please just go away, Rocky!<br /><br />That is all!<br /><br />EDIT: 12/6/2006<br />I was just listening to Opie and Anthony, and as expected, the first reviews are starting to come in for this bomb.  As expected, Rocky is showing his age, and expected reactions to this fuddy dudy has been "embarrassment" at best.  I suggest Rocky take his "middle age" magazine, and his "dinosaur" antics in a DeLorean time machine with Marty McFly and Doc, back to 1979, when he was a success. Maybe he'll score with Marty's mom?<br /><br />EDIT 6/4/2007<br />MCW aka MC White responds:<br /><br />Well, well, well, a'int that sweet?!  You finally see the movie that you were "positively reviewing" before you even seen it!  Ain't that sweet?!  Well, I'm glad!  But you forgot one thing.  To "eat" our words, we have to agree with your words.  And agreeable, a'int how I'm feeling just about now.<br /><br />And I'm a big Sports movie enthusiast...by the way!<br /><br />I did also see this movie, finally, on DVD.  And you know what?  I thought it was very "clickish" and hackneyed and stereotypical.  I really did laugh a lot,... at Rocky, throughout the entire movie.  I can't believe he's still trying to paint himself as this "castaway" Philadelphian.  What a joke.  He owns a restaurant, and he wears a sports coat (the same one every night?) and talks to his customers every night, about being this great fighter?<br /><br />If I were a regular in that fictional restaurant, I'd find myself ducking, and getting very interested in my Pasta Primavera, every time I saw that lout walking towards my table, praying that we didn't make eye contact, for fear of 45 minutes of his "dwelling on the past."  Hell, even his brother-in-law let him have it 25 minutes into the film.  And Rocky is probably sustaining his "alcoholic" lifestyle with his money.<br /><br />I did feel his pain, regarding his dead wife.  I can only imagine how his character must have felt.  But what the hell.  Even Basketball players have awesome `cribs' and tight rides.  Why the hell is he driving around in a beat up white van?  Where's his glass house?  Did I miss something.  Did some Nigerian Banker dupe him out of his millions?  Completely unbelievable.  Sorry.  Just stupid and ridiculous!<br /><br />I don't know why, but I don't find myself "feeling" for that type of character that is Rocky, I find myself despising that type of character in films.  And you know what. I specifically remember the reviews for this movie in the San Francisco Chronicle being very similar to what I'm saying here.  Clich&eacute;d and silly.  And stupid.  I also remember Opie and Anthony lambasting the movie, and calling it weak on the radio.  I remember very few positive reviews.  At least this part of the country.<br /><br />I did enjoy the black and white with red blood scenes near the end.  I thought that was pretty clever, and visually appealing.  I did enjoy the fight scenes, though I though it ridiculous to see Rocky in the ring with a young fighter.  Very silly!<br /><br />2 stars out of 5.  Barely watch able.<br /><br />MC White<br /><br />Damn its cool to be # 1 reviewer!</p></body></html>

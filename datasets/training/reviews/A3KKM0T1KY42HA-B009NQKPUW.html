I opted for Instant Video and I think that the movie is so good that I should have purchased it to put in my Blu Ray collection next to my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000VCZK2">Alien Quadrilogy</a>.<br /><br />Prometheus is a must for fans of the Alien franchise. It takes a more philosophical turn than the action-heavy Alien movies, but that's what makes it uniquely great. And don't get me wrong...there is ultimately plenty of action. It's just that Director Ridley Scott and his writing team decided to throw in the "all important" controversial questions: Evolution created Man? God created Man? Both??? Prometheus takes a ride down this slippery slope that is sure to get the ire up more from the pro-religion crowd than the scientific crowd.<br /><br />I'd be surprised if there's anyone here that already isn't aware of the movie's premise, but basically here's what you get: Some scientists/geologists/archeologists discover a clue on Earth to the beginnings of mankind that takes them to a planet/moon that will be familiar to Alien fans. There, they hope to have "the all important question" answered. And you know--by at minimum watching the trailers--that the crew get a lot more than they bargained for than just answered questions.<br /><br />The acting is awesome and the special effects are top notch. I was glued to my seat. I felt that the movie moved at a quick pace, and I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of the just over 2-hour flick.<br /><br />Is the movie flawless?...Heck, no. And if you've already seen the movie and you have not read the 1-star review on the front of the Prometheus product page here at Amazon called "Take the Scientist's Survival Pop Quiz v2.0!" on September 23, 2012 by Arthur J Bullock Jr, it is worth the short, accurate and amusing recap of the movie's major holes. If you've not seen the movie, I'd stay away from Mr. Bullock's review due to the spoilers involved.<br /><br />My take is that Prometheus fits in as an outstanding, unexpected, unique and unpredictable prequel to some of my favorite movies ever made.</p></body></html>

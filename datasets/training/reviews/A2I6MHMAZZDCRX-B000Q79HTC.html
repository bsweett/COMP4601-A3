<meta name="summary" content="Great Action Sequences but Flawed Plot"></head><body><p>Jason Bourne wakes up adrift at sea with no memory of who he is, how he got there, or why he has two bullets in his back.  As he follows the few meager clues he has to find his identity, he attracts the attention of someone or someones who want to kill him.  Yet he seems to already possess the knowledge needed to stay alive.  Can he outwit his opponents to find his missing memory?<p>This movie came highly recommended to me, so I couldn't wait to see it.  I was drawn in from the beginning and the action sequences had me on the edge of my seat.  I was also intrigued to find out what was really going on.  However, as the movie progressed, I began to get very disillusioned with it.  Jason keeps making mistakes that I knew better then to make.  And, sure enough, they get him in more trouble.  For a character that was established from the beginning as a smart spy, this really bothered me.<p>If you're willing to forgive plot holes, there are some wonderful action sequences here to enjoy.  Otherwise, skip this movie in favor of something where the plot makes a little more sense.</p></body></html>

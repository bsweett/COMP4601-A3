<meta name="summary" content="very funny but its too overblown for me...not the worst"></head><body><p>I think Trey Parker and Matt Stone out did themselves on this project. I admit they did an awesome job on the whole movie with the choreographed action scenes but what the hell is up with the puppet sex and the 2 minute puking. It was South Park but in puppet version but I didnt like it that much. Though I thought the fact that the bad guy was Kim Jon Il was hilarious and his puppet is awesome and him singing a song was better. The Team America theme song was funny too and also that fact that they made those celebrity puppets and killed them all was a riot as well. Best parts are all with the Kim Jon Il puppet. Very, very offense in everyway and if you can handle that sort of thing it's fine but sensitive people beware, this is not a rejected episode of Thunderbirds its way different. Good luck.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A near-masterpiece - Gibson goes all out"></head><body><p>Hide the children and the faint-hearted! APOCALYPTO is the most harrowing, viscerally violent film I've seen outside of several Italian exploitation flicks and that opening sequence in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. APOCALYPTO is an epic movie which narrates the savage adventures of a young hunter, Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), in the waning age of the Mayan civilization - it tells of the disruption of Jaguar Paw and his fellow villagers' simple existence as they are captured by an invasive war party and of Jaguar Paw's torturous journey back to his pregnant young wife and son as his captors mercilessly go on the chase.<br /><br />APOCALYPTO was strenuously filmed in the Mexican state of Veracruz and the rainforests of Catemaco; director Mel Gibson was conscientious about hiring a cast comprised entirely of native actors and, much like in the ambitious use of Aramaic in PASSION OF THE CHRIST, having them speak in Yucatec Maya (with English sub-titles), thus lending immense credibility and authenticity to the picture. The glory and savagery of the Mayan culture are in full depiction here as we are treated to majestic temples and pyramids rising up in cinematic grandeur, followed by intense, gory scenes of unhinged violence and vicious sacrifices (decapitations, eviscerations, bodies being pierced, and, in one brutal moment, a face being bit off by a jaguar - *yech*).<br /><br />Tinged with prophecy and doom and resplendent with truly spectacular cinematography, APOCALYPTO is also well served by the acting performances of the unknown cast. A standout, of course, is pow-wow singer and artist Rudy Youngblood, who  makes his acting debut here and boldly carries the film. Dalia Hernandez (Seven, Jaguar Paw's pregnant wife) also acts for the first time and acquits herself well. Raoul Trujillo, on the other hand, is an experienced actor who is appropriately fearsome as the leader of the Holcane warriors, Zero Wolf.<br /><br />The fully realized APOCALYPTO is guaranteed to transport the viewer back hundreds of years to an ancient culture, of which downfall has been cloaked in mystery and conjecture. It's quite an experience. Mel Gibson dips his hand once again in riveting myth-making. The first half of the film is punctuated by awesome world-building as Gibson delves into the Mayan culture, with particular emphasis on the ruling priesthood who insist that more and yet more sacrifices will stave off doom to their declining way of life. The last half of the movie, however, does devolve into basically an extended chase sequence, however harrowing and thrilling. That Jaguar Paw can sure take a licking.<br /><br />This film may be too intense and graphic for some viewers. Several of my friends thought APOCALYPTO too gratuitous in its violence but I feel that the graphic nature was required to drive Gibson's particular vision home. Else, this probably would've been reduced to being a watered-down cultural film. Think what you will of Mel Gibson, he is a great filmmaker who will not stint on his cinematic visions. And, in that purview, I do respect him. APOCALYPTO is unrelentingly violent, thought-provoking, dream-like at times, and truly majestic. And, for my money, it's a near-masterpiece.</p></body></html>

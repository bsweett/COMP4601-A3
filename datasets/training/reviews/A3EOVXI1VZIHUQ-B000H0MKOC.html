The focus of the movie is the art of forming your argument so that you are always right. Stephen Colbert has created a term for this idea: "truthiness".<br /><br />Aaron Eckhart portrays tobacco lobbyist Nick Naylor as a very human guy who understands that he "gets paid to talk." He justifies his job to himself (and his son) and explains that we "all have to pay the mortgage". The entire cast performs well in this film, aside from Adam Brody, who's turn as Rob Lowe's "yes man" is stiff and unfunny.<br /><br />While Thank You For Smoking is enjoyable and well-done satire, the story starts to run a bit long and in the end I think an hour and a half of The Colbert Report would provide more biting satire for this particular topic.</p></body></html>

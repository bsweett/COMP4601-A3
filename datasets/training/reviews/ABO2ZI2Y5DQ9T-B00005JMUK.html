<meta name="summary" content="Slightly Overrated, But Morbidly Compelling Look on Aileen"></head><body><p>'Monster' is not the first film that feature the life of Aileen Woumos -- Jean Smart did her role in made-for-TV film 'Aileen Woumos: The True Story' in 1992 (which I have not seen), and director Nick Bloomfield made TWO documentaries 'Aileen Wuomos: The Selling of a Serial Killer' in 1993 and 'Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer' in 2004.  So, what makes her life so compelling in this morbid way?<br /><br />Though 'Monster' does not give the definite answer, it still attempts to shed a light on the life of this serial killer in terms of her relations to another woman named Selby (Christina Ricci).  As you know, Charlize Theron gives very convincing acting as Aileen who finds a hope of life in this lonely girl, which turns out short-lived and more pernicious than she at first imagined.<br /><br />The story is surprisingly simple.  Aileen meets Selby at a bar, and Selby, knowing that her relation with Aileen would be looked down as indecent by her father and relatives, keeps on meeting her, and fell for her.  Finally Selby leaves the home, and begins a new life with Aileen, but later she comes to realize that Aileen killed a guy, and she just cannot stop killing men, even the totally innocent ones.<br /><br />Don't try to seek 'truths' about the killer and her life.  The strength of 'Monster' lies more in its obviously fictionalized (so I believe) part of Aileen who seeks desperately something in life, than in the reveiled facts themselves, which the film hardly has.  The film leaves out many things -- such as Aileen's marriage, and at least one killing is depicted as self-defence (as the real Aileen claimed) -- but whether or not you trust that part, it's up to you.  Me?  Not at all.<br /><br />The unremarkable script (which is full of predictable turns) works simply because it is supported by two good acting from Theron and Ricci.  Though Theron underwent a physical change with make-ups and special diet, it is her performance that makes the film compelling.<br /><br />The film is at its best when it describes Aileen's incredibly naive outlook on life, which plays one of the basic part of the whole story.  The idea of showing that aspect of her is original, but otherwise the film itself is not as great as many critics' raving reviews would lead us to think.  And as to Ms. Theron's prosthetics, well, I guess it's time to stop that trick.  Like Nicole Kidman who won the Oscar 'by the nose,' and whose career suddenly started to look unimpressive, I think it brings a bad luck.  And have you ever seen 'The Life and Death of Peter Sellers' or 'Head in the Clouds' both of which feature Charlize Theron, and went nowhere?</p></body></html>

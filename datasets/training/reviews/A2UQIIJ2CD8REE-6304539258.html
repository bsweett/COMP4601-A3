The tenacious little robot leads the young farmer and his golden protocol droid, C-3PO, to the home of a mysterious hermit who holds the secrets of Luke's past...and future. The hermit's name is Obi-Wan Kenobi, and he is a Jedi Knight. Obi-Wan explains to Luke that he once fought alongside the boy's father, a long dead Jedi named Anakin Skywalker, that Anakin was killed by a dark and twisted former Jedi named Darth Vader, and that his hope was for Luke to carry on in the Jedi ways. Obi-Wan teaches Luke about the Force, an all-encompassing energy field created by life itself that gives the Jedi their seemingly supernatural abilities, from levitation to precognition, to incomparable speed and reflexes. The old Jedi also passes on to Luke the lightsaber of his father and teaches the boy to use the Jedi weapon, a sword of pure energy with the power to cut through nearly anything with the greatest of ease. Together, the aged Jedi, his new apprentice, and the two droids embark on a mission set forth by the message carried within R2-D2; a message from Princess Leia Organa of Alderaan asking Obi-Wan Kenobi to deliver the astromech droid safely to her home planet, for he also carries the secret plans that could help the rebellion destroy the evil Emperor's greatest weapon, the Death Star.<br /><br />Hiring a seedy Corellian pilot named Han Solo and his copilot, Chewbacca the Wookie, to fly them to Alderaan in the starship freighter the Millennium Falcon, Luke, Obi-Wan, and the droids are soon traveling through space at hyper-speed, doing their best to avoid the clutches of the evil Empire along the way. They shortly find themselves unwelcome guests in the lion's den, however, when their search for the now non-existent Alderaan lands them in the heart of the Death Star itself, a space station the size of a small moon with the fire power to destroy an entire planet with one laser blast! Together, the small band of heroes takes the opportunity to perform a dangerous rescue mission, saving the beautiful Princess Leia from the Emperor's vile henchman, Darth Vader, but not without first losing one of their own in the escape. It is now up to the remaining heroes and their princess to see the vital information within R2 is safely delivered to the rebel alliance, and that the Death Star is finally destroyed!<br /><br />In 1977, young filmmaker George Lucas changed the lives of countless young movie-goers by delivering unto them "Star Wars," a swashbuckling, sprawling space saga of rebellion, romance, and sorcery, in the style of the 1930s serials that inspired it, but with visual effects and imaginative characters the likes of which the world had never seen before! Starring newcomers Mark Hamill as naive and idealistic farm boy Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford as dashing, fortune-seeking flyboy Han Solo, and Carrie Fisher as beautiful damsel in distress Princess Leia, along with the unforgettable voice of James Earl Jones as Darth Vader and screen legend  Alec Guinness as Obi-Wan Kenobi, "Star Wars" spun a timeless tale of familiar myth and legend in a whole new way, relying on outstanding acting performances and an incomparable John Williams musical score to take viewers beyond the fantastic surroundings and into the story itself. Drawing inspiration from the annals of film history, borrowing heavily from "The Wizard of Oz," tales of King Arthur, and the works of Akira Kurosawa, not to mention the history of mankind in general, George Lucas's seemingly simple tale is so full of detail and realism, even in its most unbelievable moments, that the viewer easily becomes lost in the adventure. That's just what "Star Wars" is, an adventure; a thrill ride for the young at heart!<br /><br />After its initial release, it was revealed that "Star Wars" was merely one chapter in a 6 part saga. To be more specific, the film first known as "Star Wars" was, in fact, "Star Wars, Episode 4: A New Hope." This led to two sequels that brought the story together as a legendary film trilogy beloved by millions of fans who buy up "Star Wars" merchandise greedily to this day! In 1997, "The Star Wars Trilogy" was rereleased to theaters for a new generation. It was a rerelease that brought mixed emotions among fans due to the new additions George Lucas had made to his film legacy. Through the magic of digital technology, special effects scenes were improved, deleted scenes were added with new digital characters, and the films were made to fall more in line with Lucas's original vision, which had been impossible to realize fully in the 1970s and `80s. George Lucas was happy. Many fans were not. However, many fans had no problem with the changes and even welcomed them, if awkwardly. It was all a foreshadowing of what was to come. Now, the first three chapters of the "Star Wars Saga" have been released as well, and the tale is complete; no longer a simple tale about farm boy Luke Skywalker and his friends defeating an evil galactic empire, but now a much deeper tale of redemption the likes of which was only emphasized before in Episode 6, "Return of the Jedi."<br /><br />With the long awaited DVD release of the original, or "classic" Star Wars Trilogy came even more "improvements" from creator George Lucas, continuing his attempt to make the six Star Wars films fit together as one epic story. The most noticeable, in this reviewer's opinion anyway (all those complaints about the Greedo scene seem overblown to me, and I'm a huge Han fan), is the scene where Han Solo converses with Jabba the Hutt. First restored to the film with a digital Jabba in 1997, the DVD release offers a NEW Jabba in this scene; one that looks considerably more like the Jabba the Hutt we are all familiar with. While the new CGI Jabba still doesn't seem quite as harmonious with the rest of the picture as such digital characters do in the prequels, the whole scene is still quite an impressive feat and completely welcome as far as this fan is concerned, especially with the much needed update. Though, it kinda makes my action figure of 1997 Jabba pretty pointless. In general, aside from the digital removal of one of my favorite characters, Lak Sivrak (AKA the cantina wolf-man, another of my action figures that has been made obsolete!), I have no problem with the new SPECIAL special editions of the Star Wars saga. Though, as a hardcore fan, it does seem wrong that the original versions are not ALSO available on the DVDs (Disney gives the option on THEIR special editions, after all). Each film in the classic Star Wars trilogy includes an audio commentary option. "A New Hope" features commentary by George Lucas, Carrie Fisher, Ben Burtt, and Dennis Muren. The commentaries are enjoyable, but they were clearly recorded separately, and one wishes that if they had to be recorded that way, that we could have received the complete commentaries of the individuals rather than a single compilation track. Nevertheless, a fun listen. Of course, if you want the other great extras, you'll have to get the whole trilogy set, but don't get your hopes up. The bonus disc in the Star Wars trilogy set is painfully lacking the deleted scenes of Luke and his friends on Tatooine, the 1997 Jabba scene (hey, it'd be nice for historical purposes), the classic Kenner toy commercials we grew up with, AND the infamous Star Wars Holiday Special. Then again, I guess one could come up with tons of extras that could have been included but weren't. That was just MY wish list. We'll see what future DVD rereleases bring. At least those awesome teaser trailers are included on the bonus disc. Anyway, back to the subject at hand, "Star Wars, Episode 4: A New Hope:" Still one of the best films ever made, still the same powerful experience (despite alterations), and still my favorite version of Leia!

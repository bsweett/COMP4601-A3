Wonderful atmosphere, as far as I'm concerned. (But that doesn't make a great horror film, as "Silent Hill" proves.)<br /><br />"Dead Silence" is virtually packed with the trappings that I really enjoy in horror movies. There's a fog-swirled cemetery, creepy dolls, a vengeful ghostie, and more. This movie had more spooky settings than ten other horror films; you've not only got the dilapidated remnants of a grand old vaudeville theater on a misty lake near an abandoned quarry ... but you've also got a cavernous Victorian estate straight out of "The Haunting of Hill House" or "Dark Shadows", as well as a dark and sinister crawlspace beneath a funeral home. Visually, this was all very pleasing to the eyes.<br /><br />I read that movie bombed at the box office, and critics were fairly merciless in pointing out its bland characters and blatant twist. The story was fair (we've seen this before), but definitely predictable in some ways-- in fact, the film ends with a cool twist that you can see coming from the first act, but it is very effective nonetheless.<br /><br />"Dead Silence" has the feel of an old fashioned horror film in the vein of Vincent Price's Poe movies, Hammer Films, or even William Castle. It wasn't terrific but it was definitely entertaining. It is not gory although it features what I'd call some gruesome imagery (which I thoroughly enjoyed).<br /><br />The movie is filmed in some sort of soft blue wash, either via filter or done in post production. This actually makes the color red, which is used carefully and prominently, all the more vivid and noticeable. Also, the ominous phantom of silver-haired ventriloquist Mary Shaw was a delightful creation to me. I've seen witchy ghosts before in movies (haven't we all, from "Darkness Falls" to a dozen other flicks), and this one was impressive and memorable. Great makeup effects, costume, and a gleeful performance by the striking actress Judith Roberts (who was cast during auditions in Manhattan after the studio just couldn't find the right type in Los Angeles).<br /><br />This is one of those movies that often gets mixed reviews from viewers. I liked it. I wasn't blown away by it. And it's such an interesting departure from "Saw", as if that movie's creators decided to go a very different road entirely, and switch gears to a more retro flavor and look and tale. I prefer supernatural horror, so this appealed to me.<br /><br />Bottom line: if a macabre and stylish movie is what you're craving, this could do the trick.</p></body></html>

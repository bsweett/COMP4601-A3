I saw it in 3D, which was nice but not necessary. (3D is older than dirt, but it didn't seem to go over well in the old days.) You may remember Seth Rogen from "The 40 Year Old Virgin".<br /><br />The movie begins at The Daily Sentinel (Daddy's newspaper business).  Young Britt Reid is sent home for fighting in school, but was really trying to defend someone.  Daddy James Reid gets so mad, he rips the head off the boy's favorite toy, a super hero doll.  Britt grows up hating his father, believing that Daddy is way too hard on him.<br /><br />Fast forward probably something like 20 years or so.  Mr Chudnofsky is the head crime boss in Los Angeles.  He controls all the drug stuff and dares anybody to try to do their own thing.  When something happens to Daddy, the family business is dumped into Britt's hands.  Britt/Seth Rogen is not a go-getter.  As a matter of fact, it's about all he can do to find his coffee in the morning and boink the ladies while living off Daddy's money.  As you might have guessed, Chudnfsky and the Hornet's parallel activities collide.<br /><br />Britt meets Kato while searching for his coffee and they bond.  Kato was Daddy's mechanic, but also so much more.  Kato can design and build some super neat stuff--like he is an electronic genius!<br /><br />This flick is extremely entertaining.  It has lots of action, lots of stunts, martial arts, and is pretty darned funny.  There are gunfights, car chases, and lots of really cool gadgets.  Seth Rogen is wonderful as Britt/Hornet, and so is Kato.  Cameron Diaz also plays a newspaper employee.  I was pleasantly surprised at this movie and highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

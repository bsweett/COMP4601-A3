<meta name="summary" content="I guess I'm not a big fan."></head><body><p>I have to say that I am not familiar with anything that has to do with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, or had had any other contact with the characters apart from this movie so I cannot make any comparisons to other sources, nor can I take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have.  Therefore, coming from someone that did not "know" of Willy Wonka prior to the film I have to say... that I was rather disappointed!<br /><br />The film brings to the screen the story of a young boy whose dream of visiting the Chocolate Factory comes true. There he discovers all sorts of surprises that he never even dreamed existed.<br /><br />The acting is about average, the colors are nice and that's about it.<br /><br />In a nutshell, it's a pretty good movie for kids, while an ok movie for most adults; it lacks that extra something to put it over the top.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Silence of the Lamb sequel not quite as delectable"></head><body><p>Novelist Thomas Harris has written three books about Hannibal Lecter - The Silence of the Lambs, its prequel, Red Dragon, and the sequel, Hannibal. The books, with their scenes of graphic and horrific violence, are more readable than they are filmable. This has not stopped Hollywood, of course, which has even filmed Red Dragon twice - once in 1986 as Manhunter and now under the original title in a version due to be released in 2002. <p>Hannibal nearly didn't become a movie. In his books, Harris created two famous characters, Lecter and FBI Agent Clarice Starling, whom Jodie Foster recreated for the movie of Silence of the Lambs. Ms. Foster won the Oscar for best actress, and the role became the one for which she is most famous. Hannibal's problems arose after Foster declined to play Starling again. The book's ending showed the character doing things Foster felt her Clarice would never do. This is a classic case of artistic differences. Harris had created his version of Starling, and Foster had created another one. Eventually it was agreed that the ending would be changed, but, by then, Foster was no longer available. Getting Hopkins to agree to do Lecter again had never been a problem. Luckily, the producers discovered that another enormously talented actress, Julianne Moore, was available, and project was saved. <p>This movie takes place several years after Dr. Lecter's escape from a mental institution, and he's still on the loose. Clarice remains with the FBI. She isn't the naive young woman she was when she first did battle with the demented doctor. She's a seasoned veteran and has a hard edge to her. Just as she begins to suspect that Lecter has resurfaced in Florence, Italy, she gets involved in a botched FBI operation and is suspended from the bureau. This slows her down but hardly stops her pursuit of him, as she and Lecter are inevitably drawn together through the strange and twisted bond they established long ago. Meanwhile, in Italy, local police inspector Rinaldo Palli [Giancarlo Gianinni], who is more interested in the huge reward posted by one of Lecter's victims than in justice, is about to learn that the doctor is not someone you play dangerous games with. <p>Once more Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as Lecter. He's such a great actor that he could probably entertain us just by reading from a telephone directory. It's not his fault that the character is not quite as interesting this time. One of the most fascinating things about him in Silence of the Lambs was the fact that he was confined to a cell and had to use his mind to envision what Clarice was telling him. Since he is free in Hannibal, the role doesn't require Hopkins to use quite so many acting skills. Moore does well in the rather thankless job of replacing Foster. She wisely doesn't attempt to duplicate any mannerisms her predecessor used. She playa Starling as she might have been when she was older. Ray Liotta is sufficiently sleazy as a government official who is Starling's arch nemesis. Gary Oldham has a major role, but he isn't listed in the opening credits and is impossible to recognize except in one short flashback. <p>I have some fairly major complaints about the movie. The script isn't as strong as Lambs' was because it veers away from the psychological aspects. This makes it far less chilling on an intellectual level. Much of its violence is gratuitous and seemingly meant to gross the viewer out. I know you can do all sorts of tricks with computer generated graphics, but does that mean you should use them just because you can? If, for example, you graphically show someone's being eaten alive by pigs, as Hannibal does, it produces an instintive fear in most people, but, ultimately, too much of this stuff results in mere cheap thrills and brings down the level of the movie's quality.</p></body></html>

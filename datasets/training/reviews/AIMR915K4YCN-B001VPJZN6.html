Afterall, what else could possibly be done with this insane, yet incredibly well told story? A lot as it turns out. RED DRAGON is a "pre-quel", occuring before agent Starling's arrival. Yes, Hannibal Lecter (sir Anthony Hopkins) is in it. He is still the sinister black heart of the series. This time, he's called upon to help the FBI track down the equally evil and mysterious "Tooth Fairy" (Ralph Fiennes) killer, who is killing entire families and leaving bizarre clues behind. Ed Norton is agent Will Graham (who incidentally put Lecter away after being stabbed nearly to death by the good doctor). Graham has been  retired ever since, with his wife (Mary Louise Parker) and child in Florida. His ex-boss (Harvey Keitel) Coaxes Graham out of retirement in order to try and stop the TF before he kills again. Graham eventually seeks Lecter's genius and intimate knowledge of the subject matter. Together, they slowly put the Pieces in place. Can the Tooth Fairy be caught before killing again? What is the secret behind his murders? Norton and Hopkins are excellent in their roles. Feinnes is great as a truly menacing psychopath. He plays his twisted yet pathetic character with ease and believability. He pulls off the near impossible task of being a serial murderer deserving of at least some sympathy. Emily Watson plays a blind woman who unknowingly finds herself in love with the Tooth Fairy! I would put RED DRAGON in the same league as THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS. It's smart, scary, and packs quite a punch, even for this jaded viewer...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Alternate title= How to become bear poop in 13 years or less guaranteed!"></head><body><p>This movie is PAINFUL to watch! At every moment you cringe and wince at the cheesiness that spoken by this insane lunatic...Your mouth gapes open with horror and disbelief as he pets GIANT HUNGRY PREDATORS and talks to them as if they are puppies. The bears don't look at him like they love him or are "bonding" with him. They just look at him like, "What is that THING doing in our home? Maybe if we ignore it, it'll go away!" and they are pretty much indifferent and just seem to be tolerating him rather than befriending him. This is obvious to everyone except for Timothy Treadwell.<br /><br />No joke folks. Timothy Treadwell actually caresses bear poop in this movie and goes on about how it's still warm and (ew!) just was in her. Then he goes on about how `perfect' the bears are. It's creepy, it's disturbing and I confess at times the movie is downright laughable. This movie is a train wreck but for a different reason than many other movies. It is the true and tragic story that proves how real life can sometimes be crazier than fiction. At this point in the movie I was like "Okay, this man is officially whacko!" and yet I couldn't stop watching.<br /><br />There is some beautiful wildlife and nature footage but this movie isn't about wildlife.  It is more of a statement about the nature of human mental illness. It is about one sick, delusional, self-centered and basically insane man who thinks he is some kind of "bear whisperer" and he spends 13 summers with them claiming he is 'protecting' them from poachers...Huge scary animals with big claws and teeth who live in a PROTECTED park...clearly what they needed was an effeminate buffoon there to protect them for a few months a year, right? Um, NOT! Also, how is a buffoon with no weapons supposed to protect huge, scary animals from scary guys with guns? One has to wonder...<br /><br />Tim Treadwell ended up doing far more harm to the bears than good. If he "loved" these animals as much as he claimed he would have realized the best thing for them is to stay WILD and thus, to stay away from humans. Instead, Treadwell spends much of the movie baby talking to these huge beasts as if they were teddy bears. All the while the bears seem to be merely tolerating him. The "bond" that he imagines between him and the animals seem more like a fantasy imagined in his own mind. It is clear that he wants to escape the human world and puts the world of bears up on a pedestal as if it were some high school clique he is trying to fit into.<br /><br />He sits curled up in his tent with stuffed teady bears (again no joke) making videos while real, dangerous bears lurk outside. He is supposedly this "rugged" mountain man yet we never see him in dirty clothing or shoes, his hair is always trimmed in the same bowl-haircut (with a matching colorful bandana) and his face is always clean shaven. If he was some tough mountain man, why wouldn't we see him with scraggly hair and a beard? Yet we don't. We see him go on long-winded, emotional, angry rants about the park rangers, the human world and society and even his own (questionable) sexuality.<br /><br />As it was said so well in the movie, Tim crossed the invisible line that exists between man and nature. We should fear wild animals and they should fear us. Both are safer this way. If we DO choose to observe wild animals in their natural habitat, we should respect their home and obey safety rules. Wild animals should stay wild and those of us who truly are `at one' with nature recognize this. We are HUMAN and this means we should use our large brain to make educated decisions like keeping ourselves and the wilderness we love safe from harm.<br /><br />Chances are, you already know how the movie ends but you have to see the movie to really understand the madness that is Timothy Treadwell. This isn't a movie about bears. This is a movie about a man losing touch with reality. Tim became so lost in nature that he forgot the natural order of things...The natural order that says bigger predators eat smaller ones! Tim forgot that humans are a predator too and we have HANDS so we can carry WEAPONS! "Kind warriors" were probably not the reason that humans survived. We survived because most of us have the common sense to either AVOID or KILL a huge predator like a bear! Most humans in our history probably had the common sense to NOT do the things that Timothy did...but we see early on that Tim isn't like most human beings!<br /><br />Bears are dangerous wild animals. People can try to `befriend' them in the wild, feed them, put them in circuses and make them jump through hoops but the fact remains they are and will always be WILD and DANGEROUS! If they don't eat us it is because they aren't hungry enough...Unfortunately for Tim, the bear that ate him just happened to be hungry that day. The bear also wasn't afraid of humans probably because Tim had `bonded' with them and didn't use bear spray...Didn't use a harmless pepper spray to scare off a HUGE animal that can tear a human to pieces...a weapon that could have saved the lives of two humans and the bear.<br /><br />As far as this being a "good" or "bad" movie, really it is hard to say. It is a REAL movie and reality can be harsh and nature can be cruel. Some people might say it is exploitive but I think it is educational. I think this is a story that is better off being told. I don't think I would buy this movie but I would probably watch it again. If you are the type who hates to know the ending, DON'T watch this because the ending is obvious to everyone but sadly for Timothy, he could not see the obvious until it was literally biting his head off.<br /><br />My hope is that this film serves as a warning for people. Someone out there might see this and say "Maybe it ISN'T a good idea to make friends with ___(insert dangerous wild animal) I could get eaten like Tim Treadwell!" For that and that I give it four stars, not because it was a great movie but because it has a great message. Herzog didn't lie or bend the truth. He used the footage that told a very sad and very true story and he lets us be the judge. If you love this movie or if you hate it, if you think Timothy deserved his fate or if you don't one thing is certain: After watching this you probably WON'T want to go on any camping trips in the Alaska wilderness!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Can you  say "senseless remake," boys and girls???"></head><body><p>Both Gregory Peck, Lee Remick, and composer Jerry Goldsmith should be turning over in their respective graves at the illogic of making a shot-by-shot, slightly altered lines and situations, remake of the classic 1976 film.  Liev Shrieber, assaying the Peck part, seems as though he's asleep throughout the film, only coming to life at the end as his "Richard Thorn" prepares to kill his son.  Julia Stiles fares better as wife "Kate," trying to cope with the possibility that the child she's raising may have some sinister motives.<br /><br />Mia Farrow's "Mrs. Baylock" strays quite a bit from Billie Whitelaw's in the original, by portraying the nanny as "sweetness" and "grandmotherly," revealing her true nature near the film's conclusion.<br /><br />David Thewlis is no David Warner.<br /><br />Michael Gambon doesn't do justice to Leo McKern's portrayal in the first film.<br /><br />And Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick ("Damian") is about as scary as "The Pillsbury Dough Boy."<br /><br />As far as Goldsmith's Oscar-winning score, it is interpolated during the film's end credits, and snippets can be heard throughout the "softer" scenes of the film.<br /><br />However, maybe the director would've had more success if he had used Goldsmith's score in its entirety.<br /><br />Gus Van Sant in his by-the-numbers "Psycho" remake was smart enough to utilize Bernard Herrmann's classic composition.<br /><br />'Didn't make it a box office smash but made watching it a whole lotta more enjoyable.</p></body></html>

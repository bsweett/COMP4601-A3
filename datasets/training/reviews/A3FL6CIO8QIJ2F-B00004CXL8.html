<meta name="summary" content=""Jack Is Back!""></head><body><p>"As Good As It gets" is one of the best movies from the 1990's. Winner of the Oscar for Best Picture (1997), the film garnered Jack Nicholson another Academy Award for Best Actor and won Helen Hent the Oscar for Best Actress. Nicholson plays Melvin Udall who suffers from a mental illness called obsessive complusiveness (while walking on a sidewalk Melvin refuses to step on cracks!). Melvin also has the mouth of a sewer and isn't overly friendly, but while babysitting a neighbor's dog, and with the help of a kind and outgoing waitress, Melvin realizes the true meaning of friendship and how people are suppose to act with each other. "As Good As It Gets" was a hit at the boxoffice and was on many critics lists as the Best Picture of 1997. Everything about the movie jells, from the acting to the direction along with an excellent script. The movie co-stars Greg Kinnear as the gay neighbor and was directed by James L. Brooks. The disc, which is double sided, comes with both full and widescreen formats, commentary, and more. There is also an informative booklet that accompanies the set.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Light Hearted Romance with Flair"></head><body><p>I'm happy I had low expectations when I finally got around to watching &quot;My Big Fat Greet Wedding&quot; Nia Vardalos' semi-autobiographical tale of a lonely heart Greek waitress who finds love and rediscovers the meaning of family.  So many people I know - critics included - had poo-poohed the film as too silly and slow, or simply unworthy of the hype that surrounds it.  And though I'd gotten a few good reviews from friends, I never expected to laugh as much as I actually did, or even cry the couple of times I ended up doing so.  <p>This is a warm, sweet-as-apple-pie film, certain to warm the coldest hearts in your living rooms.  Maybe some folks couldn't bear to admit liking the film out of fear of bring pegged as soft or worse yet, stupid.  Well - I'm not the smartest guy out there, and it takes alot to make me sob openly during a movie, but &quot;Greek Wedding&quot; was a blast.  Aside from the romantic sparks between Vardalos and Corbett, anyone with a diverse and crazy family will appreciate the hysterical plot and zippy dialogue taken from some of life's most precious moments.  Vardalos manages to be both a witty comedienne and a gifted writer, with a knack for setting up inspired sequences of truth and humor the likes of which have been missing from most movies for eons.  I didn't expect much, but I got much more than a great time --- I saw myself and my family in these characters - cousings and parents, in-laws and booze-swilling patriarchs.  Laine Kazan is a showstopper, while Corbett;s parents are the epitome of upper East Side WHITE-dom.  A laugh-riot combination ensues when this family decides to throw the greek wedding to end all greek weddings...from frilly stupid bridesmaid dresses to bustier-busting cousins, this movie's got it all.<p>Congrats NIA - this is a hit of epic proportions.  Whether you're Latin like me, or Greek, or Irish, African-American, or French (OK, maybe not French), you're gonna love this flick!</p></body></html>

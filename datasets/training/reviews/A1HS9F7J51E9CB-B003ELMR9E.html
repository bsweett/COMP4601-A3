<meta name="summary" content="Crime in the Land of the Midnight Sun"></head><body><p>Al Pacino is airlifted to a remote Alaskan village to help solve a homicide of a 17-year old girl.  Al is frazzled and dog-tired before he even gets there.  He soon finds out that this is the season of 24-hour sunshine.  (Though it is to be noted, the only time the sun really shines is in Al&#65533;s bedroom.) To add to his woes, there is an Internal Affairs investigation whirling about him in L.A., and his partner has just told Al that he is going to turn in evidence against him for his unorthodox methods.  They are met at the plane by super-rookie Hilary Swank who is suitably awed at meeting the great detective.  Some snappy early detective work has the police and detectives on the track of the killer in a remote wooded area.  He disappears into a fog; visibility is near zero, and Al accidentally (?) shoots and kills his partner and then covers up his culpability.<p>The film intensifies the horrendous pressure Pacino is suffering by showing his frenetic sleuthing coupled with his total inability to sleep.  The final twist of the screw is the murderer contacting him with a blackmail attempt&#65533;he has witnessed the killing of Al&#65533;s partner. Enter Robin Williams.<p>Director Christopher Nolan does an excellent job of portraying Pacino&#65533;s inevitable crackup with lightning fast quick cuts and a jittering scene of audio hallucinations.  The stark and pearly ambiance of the Alaskan scenery is shown in magnificent cinematography.  In spite of the wonders and impressiveness, I don&#65533;t think I&#65533;d want to visit any time soon.  I kept thinking: this is high summer, and all I am seeing is snow melt and people running around in their woolies.<p>The movie has good pace, though if Robin Williams had entered the action earlier, it would have been an improvement.  Pacino overwhelms.  Nolan gives him close-up after close-up until I definitely wanted a little less face time.  Williams gave some much-needed balance.  The story ends a little too tidily and predictably.  The quality of the acting is good.  Overall B+</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Spoiler-free review: Good clean fun! (well.. not so clean)"></head><body><p>I'm not normally a fan of raunchy, over-the-top, "boobies and beer" comedies. I didn't see why <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UV4XEW">The Hangover</a> was so great, but I had a great time watching Hot Tub Time Machine. Yes, the premise of going back in time via a hot tub is utterly ridiculous and you could see the film's ending coming from miles away, but it got a few good laughs out of even a cynic like me. Hot Tub has just the right chemistry to make it work. Maybe it's because of the excellent casting choice. In the hands of another set of actors and comedians, this movie could've really stunk.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Craig Robinson's style of humor or Rob Corddry's (from The Jon Stewart Show), you'll like Hot Tub. It follows a time-tested formula, used by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MEYFXW">Beerfest</a>, the Harold and Kumar films, and many others: beer, girls, comic mishaps. Not coincidentally, it reminded me of classic 80's mischief like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000056BSD">Revenge of the Nerds</a>, Back to the Future, and Weird Science for its campy humor.<br /><br />HTTB is at its core a buddy movie. Three dysfunctional middle-aged losers, each with their own problems and failures in life, decide to rekindle their friendship when one of them, Lou, a depressed alcoholic, tries to kill himself through carbon monoxide poisoning. They've drifted apart over the years and head off to Kodiak Valley ski resort to relive old times. They take Adam's (John Cusack) nerdy, shut-in, Second Life-addicted nephew with them. He brings along an "illegal" Russian energy drink on the trip. When they arrive, they find the town run-down and dilapidated. Determined to have a good time, nonetheless, they get into the hot tub and booze up. They wake up to find themselves hungover and in 1986, reliving their past and trying to avoid "the butterfly effect" of altering the future by changing events of the past. From there, they get into a series of R-rated adventures with the requisite nudity and drunken sophomoric shenanigans. Everything wraps up neatly at the end with all strings tied and everyone happy.<br /><br />As usual, slapping "UNRATED" on the box in slanted red capital letters is just a marketing ploy. It's really just two short scenes involving a topless woman and quite mundane. We also see several instances of Corddry's bare butt. I do not know how different the language is from the rated version, but Robinson and Corddry are as terrifically foul-mouthed as ever. They're paired for much of the later half of the movie, and together get into some very raunchy adventures, producing some of the funniest moments in the film and some memorable lines from Robinson (mostly due to his comical expletives and shouting). He does a lot of cursing, like his potty-mouthed barista character in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MEJYB4">Zack and Miri Make a Porno</a>. The counter-point is John Cusack, who turns in a solid performance as the more level-headed member of the bunch. There's a running gag with the porter (Crispin Glover) losing his arm and Chevy Chase makes a cameo as an annoyingly dour and cryptic hot tub repairman.<br /><br />As for complaints, the movie could've used more 80's-ness. Aside from a few sight gags all shown within 5 minutes of them arriving back in time (brick-sized cell phone, Ronald Reagan on TV, Miami Vice t-shirt, the famous Duran Duran poster by Patrick Nagel, leg-warmers) and references to 80's hair metal, the movie seems to drop this fiction pretty quickly in its art direction and dialog. I never felt a sense of nostalgia and most of the film still felt like it was happening in 2010. 80's songs play a prominent part in this film, but a lot of the musical selection I didn't recognize (or just didn't hear because it was in the background). Being a child of the 80's, most of the songs that I think of as quintessentially 80's were not here, like Boy George, Phil Collins, Madonna, Journey, etc, possibly due to licensing costs.<br /><br />All in all, still a lot of fun if you're in the mood for a silly, and very raunchy good time. Leave your maturity at the door, but that goes without saying.</p></body></html>

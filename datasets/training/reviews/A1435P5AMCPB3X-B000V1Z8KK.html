<meta name="summary" content="Great action flick, with big booms and a nice ending"></head><body><p>This movie is non stop thriller, starting out with action, and ending with action.  There are a lot of twists in this one.  Mark Wallburg is a Sharpshooter who retires after a mission on which his spotter gets killed.  Three years later he is pulled into consult on a possible assasination attempt on the president, and gets involved in a conspiracy of unimaginable proportions.  Mark Wallburg has been an underated actor for years, but should be given more credit because he takes roles he fits well.  This is a great suspense thriller/action film that you should take some time and watch.  Worth a purchase also.</p></body></html>

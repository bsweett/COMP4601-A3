<meta name="summary" content="Ferrell's Redemption Complete"></head><body><p>After the crime against all that is decent otherwise know as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ASDFGI">Bewitched (Special Edition)</a>, I have come back around to giving Will Ferrell movies a chance and I was glad I did so with "Anchorman". What could have been another unmitigated disaster turned out to be a very funny story about 1970's sexism and news teams.<br /><br />Veronica Corningstone takes a new position with the Channel 4 news team and finds herself surrounding by egotistical male chauvinists. Not that she is any damsel in distress, as she can more than handle her own and she has plenty of ambition to go with it. The love thing between her and the lead anchor, Ron Burgundy, make things all the more interesting.<br /><br />With cameo parts played by Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins, and a minor role with Vince Vaughn, this movie certainly gave the story a good shot. There is a lot of "silly" humour, but it is all very good. The comedy covers a variety of bases from the purely ridiculous to the situational and more. It is a diverse movie in this sense.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie a whole lot, and have seen it a few times now. Although not something you would want to overdo, it is an enjoyable laugh at when "times were changing".</p></body></html>

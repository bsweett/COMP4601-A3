<meta name="summary" content=""Legend" is the last HD"></head><body><p>This seems like the last HD-DVD to be issued by Warners since they'll be pulling the plug as of June.  Too bad because this disc boasts superb visuals & sound.  Smith should have been at least nominated for a Golden Globe or Oscar but I guess the committees don't appreciate good sci-fi. This film is superior to the 1971 version with Charlton Heston (RIP). If any of you still have a HD-DVD, do get this one before Warners withdraws its HD version from the catalog. Have already seen the Blu-ray version from Netflix and there's no difference. Also the alternate ending is interesting but implausible so stick with the theatrical version!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Time to go Back to the Future, Again!"></head><body><p>If there was ever a film series that was meant to be viewed together, the 'Back to the Future' trilogy is it! Delightfully madcap, the misadventures of Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox, in his signature role), and his mentor, Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd, achieving well-deserved stardom), tweak not only the time travel genre, but westerns, family comedies, rock n' roll, and Hollywood's concept of life in the future, as well, while taking viewers on an exhilarating ride!<p>Sadly, in the initial release of the 3-disc set, there were formatting problems on BTTF Part 2 and Part 3, but Universal has corrected the errors, and the entire series looks terrific, now!<p>'Back to the Future', the first of the trilogy, is the best, of course, introducing the McFly family (nerdy father Crispin Glover and repressed mother Lea Thompson, both playing characters years older than their actual ages, are terrific!), and villain Thomas F. Wilson (every kid's nightmare bully, grown up). Escaping terrorists who 'kill' Doc Brown, young Marty is launched in a souped-up DeLorean back to 1955, where he accidently disrupts history, interrupting his younger, but still nerdy father and oversexed and curious mother's falling in love (she falls for Marty, instead). Now Marty must not only return to the future to 'save' Doc Brown, but he must unite his future parents, before his family disappears, forever! (Watch for a young Billy Zane in a bit part, as one of Wilson's gang!)<p>'Back to the Future, Part II', filmed four years the original, replaces Glover (who made some insane salary demands) with Jeffrey Weissman (who isn't really seen much), and Claudia Wells (who had taken a hiatus from acting), as Marty's girlfriend, Jennifer, with Elizabeth Shue (who would achieve stardom a few years later), and picks up where the first film ends; Doc Brown recruits Marty and Jennifer to journey to 2015 to 'rescue' their future kids! The overly convoluted plot (this is the weakest of the trilogy, although the most inventive, in many ways) has the evil Biff getting hold of a sports almanac from the future, amassing a fortune, and 'punishing' the McFly family, starting back in 1955. Marty must again return to the past to straighten things out, and prevent Biff from ultimately murdering his father and marrying his mother! Then, to top things off, Doc Brown and the DeLorean disappear, thrown back to 1885, and stranding Marty in 1955!<p>'Back to the Future, Part III' is a terrific finale, as Marty, aided by 1955's Doc Brown, travels back to 1885, to rescue the 1985 version. Doc, meanwhile, falls in love with feisty school marm Mary Steenburgen, and must, with Marty's help, change history to prevent her dying, while Marty deals with Biff's evil ancestor. A climax with a time-travelling locomotive brings the trilogy to an exciting conclusion!<p>There are a LOT of extras in this DVD package, including documentaries from the initial release of the films and DVD exclusives; a in-depth interview with Michael J. Fox about his participation (On the first film, filmed simultaneously while he was starring on 'Family Ties', on TV: "I was sleeping two hours a night, but I was 22!"); a commentary track with writer/producer Bob Gale and producer Neil Canton; another audio track, featuring a live college discussion with Gale and director Robert Zemeckis; outtakes and some really hilarious bloopers; and more!<p>This is a dream presentation of a dream series, and if you haven't bought your DVD player yet, BUY one! This collection is THAT good, and VHS simply can't touch it! <p>With the 'Back to the Future' DVD Collection, to paraphrase the movies, "The Future is here!"</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bruce Willis - old & grizzly?"></head><body><p>The start of this will shock any potential lovers of Bruce Willis. (Me.) He looks out of shape (deliberate?), long GREY haired, and with a grey beard, just to round things off. The clothing is awful too, all baggy, but it has to be deliberate, as by the end of the movie, he's buff, shaved, and wearing tight t-shirts. Oh, and a topless scene too. Woohoo! Is that a real tattoo?<br /><br />This is a very character driven movie, which I was surprised at, and definitely wasn't expecting. I was thinking that if it didn't have Bruce, it could have turned into a straight-to-DVD movie that you get from the bargain bins. Having Bruce makes it worth watching (and more), and also a script that could have been the next Die Hard script does give it potential.<br /><br />The story goes like this: Bruce is now a small town police guy, who works on the policy of No Crime Tuesdays (or No Crime Week if you would prefer). He's hiding from his past, and is happy living the quiet life, although his wife and daughter aren't. (Look out for Bruce's real life oldest daughter, Rumer, playing his daughter in this. She's her mother's double, but with her father's jawline. Blink, and you WILL miss her, which shows having two of the biggest parents in showbiz does not bring you instant movie roles.)<br /><br />Three guys are across the other side of town, thinking about stealing a car. Two brothers, one good, the other a wannabe gangster, are with the ultimate bad boy, black wearing, scene stealing, Ben Foster.<br /><br />A father, daughter, and son, are in witness protection, in a house straight out of Panic Room, in fact it is one big Panic Room. The dad is a small time criminal, the daughter wants to go out, (wearing more than what I wear when I go out and no one stops me!), her father wants her to change, and the son just wants some peace. The three bad boys break in, intent on stealing the car, but get interrupted by the family, and sidetracked by an open safe full of cash, and it escalates from there.<br /><br />There's another set of bad guys, who are linked to the father, and when they find out Bruce is involved, kidnap his family. A small storyline, but still an important one.<br /><br />As I've already mentioned, Ben Foster steals every scene, and is well worth watching in this. He plays a cold hearted, evil character here, with black clothes, black hair, and very cold eyes. The character is very well developed, but not overly developed. His back story is a mystery to begin with, but piece by piece, you learn a bit more about the character. I said to my dad afterwards, that his whole character, the way he carried himself, especially the final scene, reminded me of The Crow, and particularly the late Brandon Lee. His final scene is something that will stick in my head for a good long time (I'm surprised I didn't have nightmares, without giving too much away). All his evil and emotion are portrayed vividly through his eyes, and he has the potential to be a really, really good actor.<br /><br />The whole hostage situation, and the negotiation tactics are what keeps this film going. Normally some finales leave some loose ends, but this film ties them up magnificentally, although the unidentified masked men (the second group of bad guys) does seem a little too convenient, with their motives going unexplained.<br /><br />I did enjoy this movie, and I can't wait to see more of Ben Foster, and it's well worth picking up for cheap. But I will warn you, you won't be able to forget Ben Foster's final scene.</p></body></html>

Cage plays a highway patrolman who is unable to save a mother and daughter from a tragic accident.  The failure haunts him until a letter from a past love gives him a chance at redemption.  She lives on a small island in the Pacific Northwest and her daughter is missing.  She has asked Cage to help.  Seeing a chance to save a child Cage sets off on the wild adventure.<br /><br />On the island he meets a strange group of women who don't like him being there.  They also don't believe there is a girl missing.  Cage knows there must be something going on and bullheadedly continues his investigation.  Nothing seems to make sense but something about an upcoming festival seems to be at the heart of things.  Eventually we get the shocking surprise ending we all expect.<br /><br />Although there are Pagan beliefs in this film, it lacks the true Christian/Pagan conflict of the original.  We are also missing the Christopher Lee character and the wrinkle about what if it doesn't work (Lee's life was on the line in the original).  But still, the film manages to elicit many of the same feelings as the original while also being fresher and newer.  This one, while quite good, will never replace the original in the hearts of its fans.  Check it out.</p></body></html>

It does make you think about the people developing your pictures and what they are doing with them.  Williams plays Sy the photo guy at the local SaveMart.  Sy is a bit unusual but you never realize how dangerous, even as the movie progresses.  Sy is one third harmless, one third stalker, and one third physco.  The movie starts out average and escalates a bit slow but it does move along.  But it never seems to peak, it just kind of levels off.  And that is unfortunate.  There were many avenues that this movie could have walked down but it never did,l it stayed on the main road of an average movie.  And I personally was not very fond of the ending but that is an individual choice.  <p>If you are a fan of Robin Williams you will probably enjoy this movie a lot.  If you are viewing just to enjoy a good movie I feel you will be let down.  Better to wait for the video and not feel cheated.</p></body></html>

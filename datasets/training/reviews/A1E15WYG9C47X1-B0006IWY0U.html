<meta name="summary" content="The Return Of A Master"></head><body><p>If ever there are prizes for the best directorial comebacks, then surely Peter Weir should have one. The Aussie director of classics such as Picnic at Hanging Rock, Gallipoli,Year of Living Dangerously,Dead Poet's Society and the underrated Truman Show returns with force after five years absence (Truman being his last in '98) with a powerful film that will engage you in its clever dialog and dazzle you with its well edited action, Master and Commander: the Far Side of The World.<br />Based on a novel by Patrick O'Brien and a screenplay by Weir himself, it is the cat and mouse chase in the Pacific ocean during Napoleonic times, between a British ship commanded by Captain Jack Aubrey and a much stronger French vessel.<br />The success of the film in my opinion lies firmly with the screenplay, and the well written characters that perfectly reflect their time and environment. In a short time, the viewer will find him/herself totally immersed in their individual stories, and will sympathize with their condition, be saddened by their losses and cheer their successes..<br />I found myself transfixed at the anecdotes at the captain's dinner table about Lord Nelson, touched by the heroism of the little boy, amused by the grumpiness of the steward Killick, and bemused by the sailors superstitions.<br />And this is not easily achieved but shows that Weir indeed possesses a great talent for writing that equals his visual sensitivities.<br />The action scenes, safe to say are very well directed and (equally important edited as well). I liked the fact the French vessel remains up until the end of the film, elusive and 'ghost like', as the whole film is seen exclusively through the 'eyes' and point of view of the British ship.<br />The scenery is quite impressive, especially the ones filmed in the Galapagos islands.<br />Now the acting,<br />I don't if anyone could have played Aubrey's part better than Russell Crowe! He simply plays the part to perfection, and you can clearly tell that he was very much at ease in this role, while all the other actors (mainly British) give brilliant performances that complement Crowe's lead role and Weir's masterful direction, especially Paul Bettany, James D'Arcy and David Threlfall.<br />The world of cinema is full of good directors as well as mediocre and bad ones, but only a handful can be considered artists in the truest sense of this word, (especially these days) and Peter Weir is certainly one. You have to see Master and Commander..to know what I mean and to applaud one helluva comeback!</p></body></html>

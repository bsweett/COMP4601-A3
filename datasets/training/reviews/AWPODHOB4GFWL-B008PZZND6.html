<meta name="summary" content="Sparse Raw Imagery"></head><body><p>Annie Proux's short story is magnificently reproduced on the screen with Ang Lee's amazing cinematography.  It's as sparse and simple a tale as they get, but the drama is tense and sometimes unbearable.  Jack and Ennis are two sheepherders in 1963 Wyoming, working for little money that summer.  They unexpectedly fall in love, but each one takes a different path in life.  The film follows the result of their lives and their decisions over the next twenty years.  Most people have heard of this film, but those who have seen it can speak for the raw imagery and gut-wrenching story of love that cannot be fulfilled.  The pace is deliberate and every scene or piece of dialogue rings true.  This is an instant classic and one that will be remembered forever as the movie that used to be called the `gay cowboy movie'.</p></body></html>

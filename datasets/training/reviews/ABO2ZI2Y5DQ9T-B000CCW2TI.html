<meta name="summary" content="Real Page Turner from the Director of 'Scream'"></head><body><p>`Red Eye' is a good example that proves you can make a riveting thriller with moderate amount of money if you have A) more than one talented actors and B) first-rate director who knows the genre. Here we have Rachel McAdams and Cillian Murphy for A and Wes Craven for B, and none of them would disappoint you in this above-average thriller.<br /><br />The film's intriguing premise (by the first-time writer Carl Ellsworth) is simply this; Lisa (McAdams) sits next to one charming guy Jackson Rippner (Murphy) on a delayed flight to Miami. Nothing is wrong with this bumpy flight except that Jackson is actually a freelance assassin who orders Lisa - obviously a very competent but otherwise ordinary working lady -- to do something that concerns national security.<br /><br />The lean film has only 85 minutes, and has no sub-plot about, say, Lisa's boyfriend. Her daddy appears, played by Brian Cox, who plays an important role by mostly staying out of the screen, but the film's best moments happen in the claustrophobic sequences on the airplane, heightened by the convincing acting from the two leads. The fact is `Red Eye' is most powerful when the camera decides to show the close-ups of the two in the confined space of the flying plane, which was totally missing from `Flight Plan.'<br /><br />`Red Eye' has lots of conventions of thriller, but Craven uses them cleverly without trying to hide that fact from the audiences. Instead, he embraces them, and even enjoying doing them. That's exactly what we need because we are watching this film for fun, and Craven knows it. The long wrap-up part looks to me rather silly, with our heroine holding a hockey stick, but even then the film remains watchable thanks to the excellent performances from the two rising stars of the film.</p></body></html>

When I heard that the title would be discontinued on Dec. 31, I rushed out and got it.  WELL WORTH MY MONEY!!!<p>Having never gotten around to seeing it in theaters, I waited to see the new restored edition with great anticipation.  Well, Steven Spielberg made the right choices with this one!!  What he adds to the film only further perfects what was an already perfect movie.  The enhanced special effects make E.T. look twice as good/realistic, and adds much more flexibility and muscles to his face.  We also see, in the beginning of the film, how exactly E.T. moves so darn fast!  The newly-inserted "bathroom" scene was probably the best addition to the movie; it adds more time for E.T. and Elliot to get to know eachother (and also gives a hint that E.T.'s species is slightly aquatic).  It's a very funny scene!  And the restored soundtrack by John Williams is magnificent, and is great with surround sound!<p>The special features, while not necessarily great, are good enough, and are worth at least one viewing.  The "making-of" documentary is the best of the selections, and is very interesting.  "The Reunion" was a major disappointment, as I was expecting the hour-long special I saw on TV, which was very insightful and funny.  The new one featured here is a mere ten minutes.<p>Oh well.  Even if the special features are nothing to get excited about, the true gem is that of the restored film, which no matter how many countless viewings can still manage to bring a laugh to your lips, a tear to your eye, and a joy to your heart.</p></body></html>

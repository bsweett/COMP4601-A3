<meta name="summary" content="The Joneses are Keeping Up!"></head><body><p>The Good Things<br />*Great action scenes and special effects (even though Spielburg said there wouldn't be so many, there are quite a few...but I think they're cool and still fit well with the Indiana Jones universe).<br />*Cameramanship and photography are great.  A little different and more dynamic than the originals (I think because Spielburg's style has naturally changed that way), but is still very cool.<br />*Interesting story with lots of interesting supernatural, archeological, and sociological elements (although it is pretty outlandish).<br />*Maintained proper pace, style, and mood of the original series.  Has lots of humor, some gnarly parts, and loads of exciting adventure.<br />*Remained accurate to the 1950s, in regards to politics, society, and culture (some parts made me think of "American Graffitti"...must be a Lucas thing...).<br />*Good continuation of the characters.  Indy is still cool, despite his age.  Marion (Karen Allen) is good (although I think she could have used more screen time).  Mutt (Shia LaBeouf)  was pretty good.  Cate Blanchett made a great villian.  Good acting all around.<br />*Some good homages to the original movies (although I think it was a bit much in the opening scene).<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Storyline, even though I thought it was cool, can also be seen as outlandish.  You may consider it to be silly, overblown, or too far-out (although I think it's still handled gracefully, and fits well with the Indiana Jones universe).  For that matter, this is the same type of story you would see in one of the Indy computer games.<br />*The nuclear explosion in the opening scenes (although pretty darn  cool) is kind of pointless.<br />*They never followed up on the FBI harassing Indy (then again, maybe it's not important).<br />*Lots of new characters are thrown out there, and are not nearly as familiar as any of the original characters (sorry, no Marcus and no egyptian dude).  But they do all right for themselves.<br />*Ultimately, this film does lack the original freshness and originality of the originals.  Some parts may even make you think of other Spielburg films...<br /><br />Despite having a very supernatural plot, this movie is quite exciting.  It maintains the same mood, style, and pacing of the originals.  It could even be seen as being better, now that Spielburg is a more matured director and has done more complex camerawork (whereas the original Indy films have been kind of plain and static).  Even though he said there wouldn't be so many special effects, I think there are loads of them; I think it's very cool, but others may not agree.  But no matter what you think about the quality of the film, or its characters, or plot, it is very fun to watch.  All Indy fans should check it out by all means.  Action/adventure fans may even like it  too; it looks to be one of the best that will come out this year.<br /><br />In a nutshell too, this would be to Indiana Jones what "Live Free or Die Hard" was to Die Hard.  The two are very similar in some ways.</p></body></html>

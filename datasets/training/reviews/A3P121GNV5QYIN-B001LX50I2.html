<meta name="summary" content="Hannibal Lecter is back again"></head><body><p>Red Dragon is based on the book by Thomas Harris,like the other two and it's the prequel to The Silence Of The Lambs and it's just as great as the first one.Of course,Anthony Hopkins is back as Hannibal(and like TSOTL,he's was only in for about 30 to 40 minutes)he's more chilling in this one then Hannibal,I don't know who was more creepy in the movie Hopkins or Ralph Fiennes,who was scary he gave me the willies.Edward Horton who is always a pleasure to watch was a great chioce for the role of Will Graham.Phillip Seymour Hoffman is annoying but good,Harvey Keitel is just ok as the role of Jack Crawford,which was greatly played by Scott Glen in Silence Of The Lambs.But the real treat was to see Anthony Heald as the head of the Baltimore Mental Clinic.Wonderful performances,great story and more scary then gory make Red Dragon a really enjoyable movie to watch in the dark and after you'll choose who's more creepy,The Tooth Fairy(Fiennes)or Hannibal(Hopkins).Have fun and bon-appetite.</p></body></html>

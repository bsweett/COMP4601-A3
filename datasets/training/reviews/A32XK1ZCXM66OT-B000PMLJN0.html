<meta name="summary" content="A good old fashion ghost story!"></head><body><p>Okay, this wasn't too bad. Infact, I have to say that this was a very orignal idea to come from the Creators of Saw. Basically, it's about a guy who returns to his hometown after his wife is murdered and fines out that his wife's murder could be linked to an old ghost story. About a murdered ventriloquist and her dolls. The acting was okay in this movie. So, check it out for yourself.</p></body></html>

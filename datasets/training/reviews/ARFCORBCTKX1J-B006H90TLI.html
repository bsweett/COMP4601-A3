That is, it is as much about the /process/ of film-making as it is about telling a story. We are very much aware of the film on both levels -- tale-telling plus movies-as-artifice.<br /><br />The Coen brothers often make such films. This style can work well, when the story is strong enough, and they minimize their tendency to cruelly caricature people, or turn up their noses at "hicks" who never went to college. * It also works when they perfectly mimic a literary style ("Raising Arizona").<br /><br />Despite the brothers' claim that "No Country for Old Men" is unlike anything they've done, it's obviously a rehash of "Fargo", and inferior hash, at that. Tommy Lee Jones and Josh Brolin play intelligent, appealing people, and Javier Bardem's turn as a psychotic murderer with a terrible haircut is frighteningly good, but the rest of the characters are mostly dull-witted boobs.<br /><br />In short, "Fargo" /works/, while "No Country for Old Men" is little more than an exercise in style, one that we've seen too often. "Fargo" skates dangerously close to the thin ice of the Coens' trademark style (how's that for a metaphor?), but succeeds, because, despite the Coens' tendency to hold their characters at an emotional arm's length, all have recongnizable personalities & problems, and are not merely caricatures or types. And though Marge starts off as a funny-talking buffoon, we are won over by her intelligence, dedication, and (at the end) her sincere and forthright expression of what is and isn't right.<br /><br />Ultimately, we are /involved/ with "Fargo"'s characters. "No Country for Old Men" isn't much more than clever writing and good acting. It's a technically well-made film, and little else.<br /><br />Just to clarify a point... I am an intellectual, I like intellecutal things, and I have no fundamental problem with the Coens' "intellectual" approach to film-making. But you cannot tell stories about "ideas", only about people. When you reduce people to shallow caricatures, you lose the ability to connect with the audience, which is the reason for making the film in the first place.<br /><br />I think I'll stop by the library and borrow the book. I suspect it's a lot better.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />Here's my book report. (I might post an extended review of the book, but don't know right now. If you're interested, click on "see all my reviews" and browse.)<br /><br />On the surface, "No Country for Old Men" has "Coen brothers movie" written all over it. It's shot through with acidly black humor and a generally dismal view of (some parts of) humanity. To my surprise, all but two or three lines of dialog were lifted directly from the book, including the following from Sheriff Bell (TLJ):<br /><br />"Here last week they found this couple out in California they would rent out rooms to old people and then kill em and bury em in the yard and cash their social security checks. They'd torture em first, I dont know why. Maybe their television was broke."<br /><br />That's not Joel and Ethan -- that's Cormac. (So is the idiosyncratic use of apostrophes and the failure to capitalize proper nouns.)<br /><br />The problem is that, in passing McCarthy's Coen-flavored story through the Coen's own filter, the Coen-ish elements are emphasized at the expense of the McCarthy-ish. The film is primarily a crime drama with an icing of social commentary, whereas the book uses the crime as a hook to hang the commentary on. The film doesn't ignore the philosophy/perspective/insight (whatever you want to call it), it's just that they take a back seat to the sorts of weirdness and grotesquerie that appeal to the Coens.<br /><br />The process of converting "No Country for Old Men" to a film both amplifies and diminishes the book. The amplification lies mainly in hearing fine actors deliver the lines. The diminution lies in the Coen's failure to clearly dramatize the book's reason for being -- an attack on the gross materialism of American society. The film shows what is easy to show -- the physical activity of the chase -- and pays less attention to the characters' inner lives -- which is not the Coen brothers' "style", and would kindly bring the film to a dead stop, anyway.<br /><br />The Coens are not known for their "humanity", and the relatively thin treatment of Llewelyn's and Ball's marriages -- both happy ones -- hurts the film, because it largely lacks a "humane center" against which to play the utter evil of the story. The story of Carla Jean's belief about how, when she started working at Walmart, she knew she would there meet the man she was destined to spend her life with -- which she does -- is not only poignant, but perversely justifies Chigurh's claim that everything she has done in her life has inevitably led to his murdering her. Yet it is omitted in the film.<br /><br />However entertaining "No Country for Old Men" is (and it is highly entertaining), it is a poor adaptation of an outstanding novel. The Coen brothers are hardly the first directors to take what they like from a story and leave behind what is truly important, and will not be the last.<br /><br />As odd as it sounds, if you're interested in reading the novel (and I can't recommend it highly enough), see the film first. This sequence throws what is so good about the book into sharp relief.<br /><br />PS: As a degreed EE, and licensed Amateur operator (KA3QXL), I have to point out that, once the transponder was placed in the air duct, its output would be shielded to the point where you'd be hard-pressed to pick it up even a few feet away. Indeed, even if it had been sitting on the floor in the motel room, it's unlikely it could have been picked up from the highway, especially with the interrogating transmitter sitting on the car's seat, where its signal would be blocked by the door.</p></body></html>

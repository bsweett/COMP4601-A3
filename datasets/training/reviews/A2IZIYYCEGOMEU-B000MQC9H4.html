<meta name="summary" content="A  CHICK FLICK THAT WON'T MAKE MOST GUYS BARF"></head><body><p>Until I was forced to watch this film on my mother's birthday, my favorite movie that included Jack Black in the cast was THE JACKAL ( I particularly liked watching Bruce Willis blowing pieces of him away... ). That changed when I reluctantly found myself drawn into this very likeable, well-acted romantic-comedy. Cameron Diaz was also enjoyable ( another unexpected plus, as the only other film I liked her in was BEING JOHN MALKOVICH ). It is hard to go wrong with Kate Winslet, or Jude Law, but Eli Wallach almost stole the show. This is a real charmer.</p></body></html>

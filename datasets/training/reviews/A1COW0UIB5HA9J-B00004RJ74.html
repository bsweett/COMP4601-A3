<meta name="summary" content="Rockin' vampire flick!"></head><body><p>Two dangerous criminal brothers named Seth (George Clooney) and Richie (Quentin Tarantino) are two of the most wanted criminals in the US. However they find a traveling preacher (Harvey Keitel) with a son (Ernest Liu) and Katie (Juliet Lewis) as they head across the border to a seedy stripper bar and grill joint where the owners are actually vampires wanting to have their blood to make one hell of a night.<br /><br />Ultraviolent, hilarious and action-packed supernatural horror comedy action thriller from director/editor Robert Rodriguez and writer-actor Quentin Tarantino is a modern cult favorite. The film co-stars Selma Hayak, Cheech Marin (In three roles), Danny Trejo, John Saxton, Tom Savini, Fred Williamson, and Kelly Preston with some decent performances and excellent make-up and creature effects from Kurtzman, Nicotero and Berger EFX group Inc. The film is extremely violent with loads of gore including exploding heads, mutilation, eyeball ripping to more that nearly got this movie an NC-17 rating. The humor is off-the-wall and colorful all Tarantino style as it's one rockin' action-horror flick that has to be seen to believed.<br /><br />This 2-Disc DVD contains a feature length documentary on the film with extras like audio commentary, outtakes, featurettes, Trailers, TV Spots, Music Video, Still Gallery, Art Of Making of the Movie with optional commentary, Deleted scenes and alternate footage and cast and crew bios.</p></body></html>

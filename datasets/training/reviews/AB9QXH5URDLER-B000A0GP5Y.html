If you haven't seen it, don't miss it.<br /><br />Several of the reviewers rated it low in comparison to the original.  It doesn't need to be compared.  It can stand on its own.  However, if one must compare it, I liked it nearly as much as the 1974 version.  It is updated for a new generation.  Burt Reynolds even acts, which is another bonus.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="No one does it better than Kate Beckinsale in "Underworld"!!"></head><body><p>About a day ago, I managed to see "Underworld" at the theater, and this is what I think about the film...OUTSTANDING!! "Underworld" has so much action, unrelenting suspense, and mind-blowing special effects that make "Blade" seem like a walk to grandma's house! With intense direction by first-time director Len Wiseman, "Underworld" has an excellent cast led by the lovely Kate Beckinsale ("Cold Comfort Farm", "Pearl Harbor") in what is sure to be one of the best performances ever in her career. Joining Kate are Scott Speedman ("Dark Blue", "Duets"), Michael Sheen ("The Four Feathers"), Shane Brolly ("Impostor"), and Bill Nighy ("Love Actually") in which they, too, gave outstanding performances.<p>"Underworld" focuses on a thousand-year war between vampires and werewolves. Centered in the middle of the war is Selene (Beckinsale), a beautiful vampire warrior, or "Death Dealer" as she calls herself. She exists solely to slaughter a band of werewolves known as "Lycans" that her clan has been battling for centuries. Although she is aligned with the vampires, Selene falls for a human turned werewolf named Michael Corvin (Speedman) after she discovers a Lycan plot to kidnap him. When the Lycans try to make their next move on Michael, Selene is there to fend off their vicious assault. As Selene races to save Michael and unravel the Lycan plot, Selene then discovers a secret that has terrifying repercussions for both tribes -- a secret which threatens to tip the balance of power in favor of the werewolves who have been on the losing of the struggle for centuries. And as far as Selene goes, she must decide if her future with Michael is worth betraying her own people.<p>In conclusion, "Underworld" has it all! Great action, a powerful storyline, and a pulsating soundtrack that is sure to please just about anyone looking for a spectacular action film. And I especially can't wait for the sequel, especially since the end of "Underworld" was left wide open for one! "Underworld" is, without a doubt, a DVD must-have to my Kate Beckinsale collection! And all I have to say is "Look out, Angelina Jolie! There's a new girl in town, and her name is Kate Beckinsale!"</p></body></html>

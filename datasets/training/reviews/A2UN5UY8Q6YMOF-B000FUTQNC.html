Does he really need the money or can he just not judge the quality of scripts anymore?  His last decent movie was 1994's Clear and Present Danger.  And why does Hollywood continue to greenlight such garbage?  This story has been told a thousand times before-and better too.  Ford plays a bank network security chief.  His family is held hostage and he is forced to steal millions of dollars.  There is no intrigue, no plot twists.  One-by-one, the aging Ford kills off the bad guys and claims sweet revenge.  Not only is it unbelievable, it is completely boring.  This was on a hybrid disc so the HD DVD portion was crammed onto 1 side and the picture quality is not great.  This one is not even worth renting.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I was very surprised that I liked this movie; a solid movie"></head><body><p>1.  I read this book many moons ago and frankly found it boring and kind of pointless; but that was a long time ago.<br /><br />2.  I generally hate "coming of age" movies because I find them overly self-indulgent and pointless as well.<br /><br />3.  And for various other reasons, I was expecting to dislike this movie but since I had it--> I gave it a go and was very very surprised and impressed with all involved in making this film.  It was very well written, the acting was excellent, relationships between the various characters was awesome and most impressively--> the movie was not "preachy" nor did it have an overt axe to grind, one way or another.  It was just a sad but poignant film about an unique and remarkable young man.<br /><br />4.  Highly recommended, even for the non "touchy / feely" type folks out there.</p></body></html>

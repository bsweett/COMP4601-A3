Herein, there be witches!<br /><br />Ichabod Crane {Johnny Depp} is a forensic investigator who, after being assigned to the case by Judge Burgomaster {Christopher Lee}, travels from New York to enchanted Sleepy Hollow, following up on some grisly murders where the victims were all beheaded.<br /><br />With his various devices, his logic is challenged as the superstitious villagers lend their perspective on the mysterious 'Headless Horseman', who appears from out of a magnifient skeletal tree, an entrance to Hell, as well as a direct confrontation. Some history is provided on how 'The Hessian Horseman' {Christopher Walken; a Vlad-like warrior} became the phantom figure, and meets love interest 'Katrina' {Christina Ricci}, who turns out to be a latent 'white witch', whose protective spells save him in the end.<br /><br />There is a very interesting twist at the finale, where it is revealed who the true puppeteer is, thus connecting the sub-plots.<br /><br />Marvellous camera angles, special effects which compliment the story instead of distracting, splendid darkly elegant visuals, a 'gothic' adventure, and a most intriguing version of this delighfully ghastly tale comprises this pleasing adaptation of Sleepy Hollow.<br /><br />Tim Burton continues to create marvellous de-facto Satanic productions {virtually ALL visuals, and most characterizations}, combined with Danny Elfman's ingenious orchestrations, makes for a truly powerful combination, both of which are frequent pleasures.</p></body></html>

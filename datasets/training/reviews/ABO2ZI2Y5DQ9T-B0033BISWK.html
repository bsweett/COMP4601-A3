The film begins with "documentary" footage of a huge spaceship that arrives from outer space. It appears over the city of Johannesburg and hovers there for more than 28 years. The aliens that have come with the machinery are all contained in the area "District 9." Now the government and human citizens alike want them go away.<br /><br />Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley) works for a big corporation, Multi-National United. He is assigned to relocate (forcibly) the unwelcome visitors from outer space, now residents of the city's now notorious "District 9," to another place where the government promises a better life. Things go terribly wrong for bureaucratic MNU employee Wikus, however, when he stumbles upon a mysterious cylinder with black matter in it. Not exactly a bad person, but Wikus is kind of a man who always does something he is not supposed to do.<br /><br />What ensues is a tale of an unlikely hero trapped in two or more rival factions. The entertaining story is told with lots of actions and a bit of dark humor.<br /><br />Film fans may point out that some of the film's subject matters have been explored before (the 1988 film "Alien Nation" directed by Graham Baker, for instance). Sometimes science fictions with aliens from outer space can be a metaphor for immediate political issues. Director Neill Blomkamp may not be as sophisticated or psychological as, say, Don Siegel and his classic "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" - "District 9" contains considerable amount of gores and graphic violence - but the film works nonetheless, with thrilling actions and characters you care.</p></body></html>

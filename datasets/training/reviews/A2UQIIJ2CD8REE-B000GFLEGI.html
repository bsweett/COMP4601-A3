<meta name="summary" content="Another Romero Triumph!"></head><body><p>Following the events of George Romero's beloved Living Dead films, "Night of the Living Dead", "Dawn of the Dead", and "Day of the Dead", in which the bodies of the recently deceased returned to life and began feeding on the living and increasing in number, "Land of the Dead" takes us to a walled-off community where a society of human survivors live as two distinct social classes: the wealthy, who live in a luxurious building called Fiddler's Green, and the poor, who live everywhere else. The big man who runs it all is the dangerously powerful Kaufman, and the film itself focuses on the group of marauders who work for him, particularly reluctant hero Riley and wannabe social-climber Cholo. Their job is to lead teams who travel outside the city on raids to collect goods from abandoned towns. Riley, however, is sick of the life within Kaufman's city and has made plans to get a car and head north, but his plans are interrupted when his former partner Cholo takes possession of Dead Reckoning, Kaufman's heavily armed, zombie proof raiding vehicle. Riley, his sidekick Charlie, and new friend Slack suddenly find themselves coerced into a mission to retrieve the vehicle from Cholo just as a large collection of intellectually evolving zombies are working their way into the city itself.<br /><br />"Land of the Dead" is a film Romero fans and zombie fans in general had been awaiting for a LONG time. When we finally got it, many of us were thrown for a loop by the concept of zombies learning (or is it remembering?) to tote guns and feel emotion, despite tastes of this from the previous film, "Day of the Dead". Ya gotta love how so-called fans who didn't like this film are trying to tell George A. Romero how his living dead are SUPPOSED to act; creatures that he himself invented. At first, I didn't love the concept of zombies becoming thinking creatures either, but given time, I've accepted that this direction was coming. How many times can you ask George to make movies about surviving the same basic situation? Okay, I could watch a million new ones, but still, it's understandable. And yet this is the main gripe people seem to have about this film. Oh well, you can't please everyone. Putting that aside, the film itself is a great ride! Another example of why Romero zombie films are the top of the heap. The characters in the film are wonderfully written and played. Simon Baker, John Leguizamo, Asia Argento, and Robert Joy were just wonderful. Dennis Hopper is fantastic as the despicable Kaufman, and while there's nothing likable about zombie leader Big Daddy (sorry, the only good zombie is a completely dead zombie), he's an unforgettable presence. The effects are fantastic, the story is exciting and engaging. The only things I could possibly nit-pick about are one moment of CGI that is a bit too CGI, and the overall concept of money still having value (not impossible, but unlikely). Still, these things are forgivable in such a cool movie loaded with awesome scenes! Definitely a worthy addition to the Romero zombie saga, and just loads of horrific fun!<br /><br />The great looking widescreen, unrated, director's cut DVD features some great extras (though no theatrical trailer for some reason). There's a great director commentary, some excellent featurettes (including a fun day on the set with John Leguizamo and a look at Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright's experience doing a cameo in the film), and even deleted scenes! It is unquestionably a must-have for any horror DVD collection, as are all the Romero zombie flicks!</p></body></html>

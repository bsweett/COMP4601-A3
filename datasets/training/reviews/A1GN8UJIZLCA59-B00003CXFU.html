<meta name="summary" content="Brockovich is a Winner"></head><body><p>Erin Brockovich is based on the true story of a nearly destitute single mother of three who while working for a small lawyer, Ed Masry, has an almost forgotten a pro bono case the lawyer is working on for a family in Hinckley, CA thrown on her desk for her to file.  The case involves possible chromium contamination in the water due to negligence on the part of utilities giant Pacific Gas &amp; Electric.  Erin becomes intrigued by it and through her tireless effort and Masry's support, they ultimately win the case and receive the largest class action settlement in history.  Director Steven Soderbergh takes what could have been into a television movie of the week story and turns it into an intelligent, funny, dramatic and thought provoking film.  Julia Roberts is absolutely magnificent in the title role.  Her wardrobe in the film (pushup bras and tight clothing which are nice) garnered alot of attention, but they are merely a sideshow to the best acting job of her career.  She makes us feel for the situation Erin is in and through her compassion for the people of Hinckley, we too become involved and concerned for them as well.  Albert Finney contributes his usual first rate acting to the role of Ed Masry.  He perfectly plays off Ms. Roberts, absorbing the rants and abuse she heaps on him and then returning the favor with a few zingers of his own.  Aaron Eckert plays Erin's boyfriend George with the right amount caring and support that gets tested throughout the film.  Marg Helgenberger is great as a Hinckley resident who family is being broken down due to the chromium poisoning.  Ms. Roberts recently won the 2000 Best Actress Oscar and despite all the hype, it was a well deserved award.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Mirren Reigns Supreme"></head><body><p>THE QUEEN is first and foremost about Queen Elizabeth II, but it is also about Elizabeth, the person beneath the crown. To show us that person, it focuses on her reaction to the death of Princess Diana in 1997, and the media circus that followed. It was also about the complex relations between the House of Windsor and 10 Downing Street and their roles in the circus, as ringmasters, barkers, clowns, tight rope walkers, marks, and shills.<br /><br />Though Lady Di looms large in this legend, she is seen only in documentary footage, in interviews, public appearances, and paparazzi shots. No actress even attempts to play her, but it speaks to the authenticity of Helen Mirren's Oscar winning performance that the real life footage blends in seamlessly when ever she is on screen. Mirren was totally believable as Her Royal Majesty. All the little details were correct, even down to how the Royal Corgis obeyed her. A pack of dogs comes tearing through the room, then, with a single command from Her Royal Majesty; they all turn on a dime simultaneously. She had that authority in her voice, that certainty that her orders would be carried out.<br /><br />The second most important character in this story was newly elected Prime Minister, Tony Blair. Michael Sheen played him quite well, capturing his vibration, aided by an uncanny physical resemblance. He might have overdone the bright eyes--like a portrait of a Prime Minister as painted by Keene--but the slight exaggeration didn't spoil the over all effect. Besides achieving peace in Ireland, his role in stage managing Princess Diana's funeral may have been his finest hour. His popularity certainly soared after he declared Diana "The People's Princess."<br /><br />The film shows us the complex relationship between Blair and The Queen, and both their spouses have much smaller roles, but provide little flashes of insight into the characters of the two principles. James Cromwell gives a strong performance as Prince Phillip, and was totally believable as he climbed into the royal bedchamber, saying "move over, cabbage." So much for royal protocol. Tony Blair's wife was skeptical of the whole concept of monarchy, so she was a good foil, kind of a devil's advocate, if you will, for Tony Blair to express his growing admiration for the Queen, and the institution of the monarchy.<br /><br />Alex Jennings played Prince Charles, and though he was not nearly ugly enough--not saddled with the features of a horse--nevertheless, gave a good performance, almost making you feel sympathy for him. Missing in Action were William and Harry, the heir and the spare. They are rarely seen, and then only glimpsed, but this was a very tasteful choice by director Stephen Frears, and script writer Peter Morgan. Just one of many choices that make for a wonderful, well rounded film experience.<br /><br />Finally, I must mention the magnificent stag, in a cameo performance, who may be only a symbol, but a potent one, and one who illuminates just how the Queen always tries to keep a stiff upper lip, no matter what emotions are storming below.</p></body></html>

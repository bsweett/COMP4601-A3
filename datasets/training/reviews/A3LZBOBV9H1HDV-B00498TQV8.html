This is how the story goes: 17-year-old Ree Dolly sets out to track down her father, who put their house up for his bail bond and then disappeared. If she fails, Ree and her family will be turned out into the Ozark woods. Challenging her outlaw kin's code of silence and risking her life, Ree hacks through the lies, evasions and threats offered up by her relatives and begins to piece together the truth.<br /><br />The cast led by Jennifer Lawrence (in her breakout performance as Ree) is brilliant! The directing by Debra Granik (also wrote the screenplay) (who also wrote and directed "Down To The Bone" (2004) is brilliant! The screenplay (based on the novel by Daniel Woodrell) by Granik & Anne Rosellini (also produced) (she also produced "Down To The Bone") is brilliant!<br /><br />The music by Dickon Hinchliffe (who also did the music to "Last Chance Harvey" (2008) is brilliant! The cinematography by Michael McDonough (also an associate producer) (who also did the cinematography to "Down To The Bone") is brilliant! The film editing by Affonso Gon?alves (who also did the film editing to "The Door In The Floor" (2004) is brilliant! The casting by Kerry Barden & Paul Schnee (both of them did the casting to "Conviction" (2010) & the upcoming "Machine Gun Preacher" (2011) is brilliant! The production design by Mark White (who also did the production design to "Down To The Bone", "Transamerica" (2005), "Please Give" (2010) & the upcoming "Prom" (2011) is brilliant! The set decoration by Rebecca Brown (who also did the set decoration to the upcoming "Shelter" (2011) is brilliant! The costume design by Rebecca Hofherr is brilliant!<br /><br />This is a brilliant film that keeps you on the edge of your seat and thinking at the same time. This is a film that is different from the other recent films out there. Jennifer Lawrence gives the star-making performance of her career, which is already gaining her award recognition. This is one of the best films of the year.</p></body></html>

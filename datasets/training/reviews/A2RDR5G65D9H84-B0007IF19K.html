<meta name="summary" content="Grand story, great music and an unforgettable performance"></head><body><p>This movie will be remembered for a long time due to two factors. The first one is bringing the music by Ray Charles to the attention of the newer generations, allowing the genre to resurface in its popularity. The second is the outstanding performance of Jamie Foxx, who demonstrates that when you do something from your heart, things usually turn out right. And this is basically what this movie is about, a story that shows us the good and bad moments of one of the most renowned figures in music history, and how he had to follow his heart to liberate himself from the unforgiving clutch of drugs.<br /><br />The director Taylor Hackford was lucky to wait fifteen years for the right actor to come along, but he also shows that he played an important role in the success of this movie. For example, the way in which he presents the different events in the life of Ray - jumping back and forth in time instead of using a linear sequence - helps the viewer understand better the motivations behind most of the artist's actions. Events like losing his brother, losing his sight, being preyed upon by others due to his blindness and meeting people that introduced him to the drug world affected how Ray Charles lived his life. Those that see him as a flawless man will have a tough time watching some of the scenes in this film. But if you understand that he was not perfect, but someone who learned to overcome adversity, you will likely be pleased with the final result.<br /><br />Those that love the music of Ray Charles are in heaven with this movie, since it has a myriad of music segments (more than ninety), and one of the most amazing facts is that Foxx plays the piano himself in all of them! This is one of the factors that make his performance something special, but it is not the only one. The actor played the role blind; instead of wearing dark glasses and watching what he was doing, his eyes were shut together with silicone all through the day. I think this helped a lot in achieving a more believable performance, and his ability to imitate the way in which others talk helped a lot too. One thing is undisputable: Jamie Foxx received one of the most deserved Academy Awards of the last few years.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Monsters Is Scarry - A LIttle....and Funny Too!"></head><body><p>MONSTERS, INC. is a movie that when I saw it in the theatre didn't really knock my socks off as I thought it would. Juts a few things short of interesting and for me, not as entertaining as Toy Story or A Bug's Life. (Even Toy Story 2 was a little better than this.)<p>Some standout performances by Billy Crystal (America's Sweethearts, Analyze That) and John Goodman (Emperor's New Groove, What Planet Are You From?)and even Jennifer Tilly (Stuart Little, The Muse) and of course some great gag bits and slapstick humor for a computer generated film. Directed by Peter Doctor (writer of Toy Story 1 &amp; 2) who gives the film a flavor of color and flare.<p>The story is that of the concept that monsters scare you under your bed in and in your closet as a kid and this is how they do it. Very mechanical and very routine. Their job is to collect the screams of the scars and then turn it into power and energy for Monstropolis. There is one fear; the Monsters are more scared of the kids they scare then the kids themselves. Guess what? One gets in the Monster world. I'll let you imagine what happens next.<p>Now the DVD extra's are amazing. There is a very funny NEW short called Mike's New Car, which is short but hysterical. There are games, and Monster training videos and manuals and CDRom extras too. Music videos and a ton of production information on how the film was made and produced. The extras on the DVD are worth it alone. You'll enjoy this one. (9-22-02)</p></body></html>

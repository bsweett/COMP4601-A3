Now that I have seen Million Dollar Baby, I can say that it barely beats that film out and MDB is the Best Film of 2004 in my opinion. The acting from the three leads is mind blowing, with Hilary Swank and Morgan Freeman having the best chances of winning the Oscar next month. Clint Eastwood is very good as well, but he won't beat out Jamie Foxx or Leonardo DiCaprio in the Best Actor category. I know that Swank will likely win (and she deserves it), but I really hope Morgan Freeman finally wins an Oscar after all these years. How could this guy not have won for the Shawshank Redemption? It seems like everytime he is nominated he is passed over (Driving Miss Daisy, Glory, Shawshank, etc.). Anyways, back to the film. Clint's direction is spot on and even though the film is well over two hours the pace is right were it should be for this kind of film (fast enough to hold your attention, yet slow enough to take in the mood and great performances). The dialogue between the three leads always seems freshly real and my eyes even teared up during a few scenes and that never happens with me. This film and The Aviator will likely take most of the Oscars (hopefully a long overdue Director win for Scorsese) and if you haven't seen these two films I recommend that you do soon. Million Dollar Baby may be sad and depressing, but what really makes the impact so devastating is that you care about these characters and when something bad happens you feel the pain as well.</p></body></html>

The previews didn't do much for me, however, the initial buzz was favorable so I shelled out the bucks to watch it in the theater. Now with the DVD, I can enjoy it at home--the surround sound just jumps out - a very good dynamic mix with the excellent score by Michael Giacchino). There aren't too many extras, but what is there is enjoyable. The Pixar short "Lifted" about an alien in training attempting an abduction is cute; it amazes me how Pixar is able to capture the emotion and human movements of their 3D animated characters; something that the other studios don't quite have down yet. "Lifted" was the short shown with "Ratatouille" in the theaters. There is also a another short called "Your Friend the Rat," which is the story of rats through history, showing them not to be the despicable creatures that humans make them out to be. The style of this short is traditional animation (other than the intro/ending by Remy & Emile) and very well done. I really like the sketch-like style that is used here. The DVD also has a 13:53 minute featurette that cuts between Pixar's Brad Bird and French Laundry's Thomas Keller. It is truly interesting to hear the two discuss their respective fields, and seeing just how similar the creative process and philosophies are. There are also 3 deleted scenes; all of them in rough b&w sketch form. 2 ("Meet Gusteau" and "First Day") deserved to be deleted. The scene titled "Chez Gusteau" harkens back to Hitchcock, as the camera takes you to Gusteau's restaurant, through the front door and into the kitchen, all in one continuous "take." Even in the rough form, it was great fun to watch. Yet, I understand Bird's explanation that although a good scene, it didn't fit with the perspective he wanted "Ratatouille" to have. And that my friends is it for the extras. Not fantastic, but again, what is there is solid.<br /><br />Onto the movie--I found myself enjoying the characters. Amazon.com didn't seem to like the critic character, Anton Ego (voiced by Peter O'Toole). Personally, I found him to be one of my favorites. He helped add a little dark "spice" to the movie that otherwise could have been too bland. Briefly, "Ratatouille" is about a rat who loves food, and idolizes the late Chef Gusteau. When he ends up in Paris, he teams up with a klutz, Linguini (voiced by Lou Romano) and helps him become a great chef in Gusteau's restaurant. Skinner, the sous chef who is more interested in pillaging the Gusteau name by slapping it on frozen dinners, becomes the nemisis of Linguini and Remy. You can watch the movie to see how all resolves.<br /><br />In the end, I believe I still prefer "The Incredibles," but boy does this one come in a close second. Great fun for the whole family to watch, although at times the slapstick is a little violent at times (in a 3 Stooges way), there is nothing too offensive here.</p></body></html>

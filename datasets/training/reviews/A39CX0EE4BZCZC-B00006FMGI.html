<meta name="summary" content="You Get What You Expect"></head><body><p>This is a typical James Bond flick which means a lot of good things and some bad ones but at least, if you're a fan of the series, you get what you expect.<br /><br />In other words, you get outrageous action scenes, Rambo--like mentality, a wild and fun villain, a "hot" female lead helping Bond, a bunch of sexual innuendos, a hokey-but- interesting story and some outstanding opening credits. I never had any complaints with Pierce Brosnan playing Bond. I thought he very credible in the role, sincerely macho and debonair at the same time. Halle Berry was at her peak, so male viewers had no complaints watching here. She wasn't in here just for looks; she was in fighting shape, too.<br /><br />Is the story far-fetched? Yeah, a little! Ludicrous? You bet. Entertaining? Sure. Who watches these films for their intelligence?</p></body></html>

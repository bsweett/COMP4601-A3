<meta name="summary" content="Great Action!"></head><body><p>It is too bad that Bruce Willis can't crank out this films more often.  John McClain is probably the greatest action hero in all film history and this installment packs a wallop with a slew of action and humor.<br /><br />McClain is asked to bring a suspected computer hacker to be interviewed by the FBI.  The actor playing this hacker is the guy who does the Apple McIntosh comercials.  It is interesting to note that he seem to prefer a Mac in this one.  Anyway, McClain shows up just as the hacker is about to be hit by the bad guys.  Were it any other movie it would be a guy with a magnum or piano wire, but being a Die Hard movie the bad guys come with ultra modern machine guns.  Of course McClain is able to take some of them out and temporarily get away with the hacker.  Thus we have the makings of a great partnership as good as any to the Lethal Weapons movies.<br /><br />The movie has you cheering throughout, especially when McClain taunts the head bad guy about offing one of his key henchpersons and then telling him I'm coming to get you.<br /><br />Kevin Smith has a larger cameo as Warlock, a live at home with his mother computer hacker.  It is a role that seems to have been made for him.<br /><br />This is the best Die Hard since the first movie!</p></body></html>

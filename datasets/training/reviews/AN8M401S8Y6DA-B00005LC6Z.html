I liked the mystery of Michael Myers in the original and I bought into everything, any plot holes were ignored because I was so into the movie.  For me horror is scary when it is realistic or I can relate in someway or the movie does such a good job I buy into what I am seeing.  In this sequel i found myself annoyed by things or pointing out things that couldn't happen the movie never really got me.<br /><br />I'd like to also point out I am not anti remake or sequel.  John Carpenter himself has done one of the great horror remakes in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HT3Q0A">The Thing [HD DVD</a>] starring Kurt Russell.  I didn't hate this nor did I love it.  I think it is essential for horror fans in filling in the connection between Michael and Laurie.  If this title had eluded you and you had seen the original and all other sequels you'd still know the connection but would be confused.  I also do not believe this was made just for money and think John Carpenter was giving the horror fans what they wanted which was more Michael Myers and I think he makes a good effort trying to feed that hunger picking up literally from the original.<br /><br />I always like to watch a movie fresh before reviewing and I did that with Halloween 2, however going by memory I would confidently say this is the strongest sequel of the bunch, and is worth a viewing.<br /><br />I would give the dvd features but on the Goodtimes home video version of Halloween 2 there are none at all.  The audio is only done in 3 channel Dolby digital and I have seen much better transfers.<br /><br />**Interesting facts from the Internet Movie Database**<br />- This is the only Halloween film to show the morning after the 31st, every other movie ends on Halloween night.<br /><br />- The film that the security guard and the Elrods are watching is Night of the Living Dead.  (Which actually gets interrupted with reports on Michael Myers, maybe someone is trying to say something here.)<br /><br />- The 17-year-old who was hit by the police car and burnt alive, at first believed to be Michael Myers, was supposed to be Ben Tramer, the boy Laurie confesses to have a crush in in the original Halloween.  (Talk about having a bad nite)<br /><br />- Believing Rick Rosenthal's version of the film to be too tame, John Carpenter shot a few gory scenes that were added into the film despite Rosenthal's objections.<br /><br />Thanks for reading, share any comments.</p></body></html>

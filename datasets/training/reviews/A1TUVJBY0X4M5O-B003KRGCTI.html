The plot is so bare bones that it could have (and should have) been a 10 or 15 minute short film.  The twist is at first shocking and satisfying...but soon fades to "...so what?"<br /><br />I give one star to films I wish I would have walked out of, and this certainly fits the bill.  I started checking my watch about 40 minutes into the movie, and continued to do so every 5 minutes.  It's just not enough entertainment, plain and simple.</p></body></html>

Such is the case with this work. Treadwell is obviously mentally disturbed and he serves up much about himself to mock and deride. All the while, you cannot ignore his authenticity. Yes, he was self-absorbed, delusional, probably closeted, and insane. How on earth he was able to withstand the infamous Alaskan mosquito swarms boggles my mind. They're the size of small birds, it seems. His friends were odd folk. Aside from that, Herzog masterfully pieces Treadwell's footage with mesmerizing skill and his voiceover seems to convey a personal sadness for the story he is telling. Treadwell himself proved adept with the camera as many of his shots are composed with bears well-placed within the frame. His childish nature may have some rolling their eyes in embarrassment, but you can't deny that it's all real to him. This is one of the best films I've ever seen, and I cannot wait for the dvd. Also features terrific music by Richard Thompson.</p></body></html>

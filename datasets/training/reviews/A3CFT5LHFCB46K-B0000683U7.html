In twenty-four hours, he has been kidnapped, mistaken for another man, intoxicated with alcohol and arrested for drunk driving and assaulting an officer. To top it off, he is framed for murder, which leads to a nationwide search. Let's also not forget when he is attacked by a cropdusting plane. Throw in a dangerous villain (James Mason) and his mistress (Eva Marie Saint), superb direction from Hitchcock (Who makes a brief cameo in the film's beginning) and an exciting Bernard Hermann music score, you have yourself quite a ride. The movie has several clich&eacute;s that were later exhausted in other movies, but that doesn't detract from the fun. <p>Considering that it is bargain priced, the DVD of "North by Northwest" is a great buy. The film is presented in a Widescreen Anamorphic transfer that's so well done its almost impossible to tell that it is over forty years old. But the extras are really what set this above. "Destination Hitchcock", hosted by Eva Marie Saint, is a documentary about the making of this movie featuring interviews with Hitchcock's daughter Patricia and screen writer Ernest Lehman (Who also does an audio commentary). A theatrical trailer, a "Hitchcock Trailer", a TV spot, a photo gallery, cast and crew bios and an isolated version of Hermann's music score complete this excellent package. <p>Whether you are a fan of one of the stars or of Hitchcock, admire great films or just like entertaining movies, "North by Northwest" should be added to your personal library. <p>Favorite quote:<br />"I have two ex-wives, a mother and several bartenders depending on me."<br />-Roger Thornhill</p></body></html>

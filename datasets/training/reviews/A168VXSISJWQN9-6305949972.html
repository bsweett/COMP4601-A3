After the Halloween trick or treating is done, we settle down and watch TNBC. It creates a great transition between the two holidays.<br /><br />I think this is one of Danny Elfman's best movies. The Halloweentown songs are suitably creepy, but 'What's this?' has a very Christmassy feel of excitement. I love the use of color, too; appropriately gloomy for the Halloweentown sequences, but bright and cheerful for Christmastown. The story is original and the characters are memorable. There's a lot of humor, as you might expect, but some of the scenes might be frightening for younger children, so use some discretion as to what age you feel they can watch it without being too scared.<br /><br />A fun movie which repays watching over and over; there's always something new to see.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTING TRANSFER OF THIS SCI-FI CLASSIC"></head><body><p>&quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; was a movie I fondly remember from my youth as kindling that spark of cinema magic that seems to be in short supply these days.  For its day the visual effects were mesmorizing and the prospect that we are not alone in this universe became very real for me after viewing this movie.  Plot: People from all walks of life are brought to the Arizona desert by a series of space ship visits to our planet earth.<br />Columbia Tristar has really angered me with this release.  Steven Spielberg should be none too thrilled with them either.  Their 2 disc special edition presents his masterpiece in a digitally grainy, thoroughly unsatisfying visual quality topped off by excessive aliasing, shimmering and edge enhancement, low contrast levels, colors that bleed and an overall visual characteristic that ranges from too, too soft to digitally harsh.  There's no happy medium.  The arrival of the alien mother ship is totally ruined by excessive pixelization that breaks up fine details.  This is not the way I want to remember this sci-fi classic.  The soundtrack is dated but overall well represented.  The extras include a making of that is informative but a direct import from Columbia's laserdisc and some extra test and rehearsal footage that is somewhat dry.  I think Columbia would do wise to just hand over their film library to more capable hands to preserve.  Of late their transfers have gotten even worse than this.  However with this DVD release, there was a definite beginning to that end!</p></body></html>

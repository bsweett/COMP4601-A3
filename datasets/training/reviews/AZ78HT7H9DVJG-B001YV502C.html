Just read theirs, they've said everything beautiful about this film.<br /><br />All I can say is that this film enchanted me from the beginning to the end.  I love films that cause me to think after the movie is over.  But this one caused me to think about it days after I saw it.<br /><br />Clive Owens plays Theo Faron, living in England...in 2027.  People around the world has stopped being able to reproduce children.  The youngest human was 18 but was murdered for refusing to do something.<br /><br />Immediately after this murder, Theo's estranged wife appears and pleads him to help her sneak in Kee, an African-American refugee to the "other side".  However, she must have travel permits/papers.  After a round of adventure that resulted in a death, Theo discovers that Kee is actually pregnant.  The first such pregnancy in almost 20 years.  Theo suddenly understands why Kee must go to the other side...into the safety of the Human Project, whose aim is to cure infertility.<br /><br />All I can say is that *Children of Men* presented such an issue that is worth intellectual discussion.  For many, the possibility of a world-wide infertility is impossible.  However, if it should ever happen, how would the world react?  And if a woman was to get pregnant, would she be used as a political weapon or as a medical guinea pig?  And are you willing to die to ensure the birth of a miracle?<br /><br />I cannot decide which scenes were my favorites.  I liked the abduction of Theo.  I liked the escape from the Fishes.  I liked the war scenes between the army and the militia.  Heck, I liked everything.  This is truly one that you should have added to your DVD collection.</p></body></html>

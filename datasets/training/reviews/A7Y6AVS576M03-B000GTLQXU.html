It has nowhere near the character development or intensity of AIR FORCE ONE or DAS BOOT. The main character and hero of the piece is Josh Lucas (he got top billing). Lucas really has no screen presence in my opinion. He truly lacks that charismatic quality to qualify as a leading man and is much better suited to character roles such as exemplified by his performance in A BEAUTIFUL MIND. In POSEIDON Lucas truly is not a very good hero and in fact is something of a cad and a heel that never quite redeems himself. Lucas seems unable or unwilling to shake his annoying cocky attitude. Kurt Russell definitely has a certain admirable and likeable screen presence and is better suited for the role of the leading man hero. If you take one look at Kurt you know he can back up anything he says he can do in that department. The script unfortunately constantly refers to him as this overbearing dad who somehow has never even been able to cut it even in public office. This is unfortunate for Kurt, the film and the audience because we really want to root for someone in this film. Given this awkward role, Kurt does have his moment of pathos and one can only reflect with anguish about his career that should have been kinder and more rewarding for his great talents as an actor. The rest of the cast trying to escape just goes through the motions as a bunch of simpering and whimpering flock of sheep. That's the problem with this film. In the original there was a sense of purpose to the group of escaping passengers trying to survive. Their emotions and temperaments were characterized with a peculiar camaraderie comprised of harmony and discord but still they retained a unified purpose of survival. The original was an impressive maritime adventure especially bolstered by John Williams' haunting score conjuring up images and fears of the unknown perils that the vast and mysterious oceans still hold in our imaginations.</p></body></html>

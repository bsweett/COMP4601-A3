Well, nobody will ever accuse me a being a great friend of Roman Catholicism or of being a staunch conservative, but I too found this film to be pretty hard to stomach at times.<p>What was most annoying for me was how black and white everything was in this film.  The liberated chocolatier versus the stuffed shirt mayor.  Worldly cosmopolitanism versus small-town provincialism.  I expect more from Lasse Hallstrom than a bunch of straw men waiting to be knocked down.<p>I found the chocolatier to be unbearably smug, as she deftly solves, one after another, the various problems afflicting the townspeople.  You would think that these folks must be dumb as posts, because they seem incapable of solving their own predicaments.  Perhaps it is in fact because these types of problems are so rarely solved with a few simple words and some chocolate goodies.<p>The treatment of the mayor was particularly hard to take.  Here was a man of obviously deep convictions who took his duties to his town quite seriously, yet he is an object of ridicule throughout the film.  His chocolate-induced collapse at the end of the movie struck me as a false note that could not be possibly be reconciled to the personality we had seen on the screen for the previous two hours.  It seem extremely contrived?  Is it possible that the filmmakers could not successfully resolve this storyline about the conflict between the two main characters?  Left with no resolution to the move, were they forced to cobble together this ridiculous conclusion?  It just seemed too forced and unbelievable.<p>I don't like movies that pretend to have all of the answers.  However, the cinematography and music was very nice; for that, I give it 2 stars.</p></body></html>

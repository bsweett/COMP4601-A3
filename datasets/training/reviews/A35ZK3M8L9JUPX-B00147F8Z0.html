<meta name="summary" content="Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem"></head><body><p>A little town in the hills of Colorado will become the battleground between two of the deadliest extra-terrestrial lifeforms - the Alien and the Predator. When a Predator scout ship crash-lands in the hills outside the town, Alien facehuggers are released in the crash, and an even more evil creature - a hybrid Alien/Predator - is also released. A man & his son hunting in the forests near the crash site soon become the first victims of the facehuggers, and when a Predator receives data about the crash on his home planet, he comes to Earth. To be honest, this movie was a bit of a let down.  I really had a hard time connecting with any of the characters. This movie is not a complete waste, I was moderately entertained.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great film"></head><body><p>This is a great film.<br />IT SHOULD HAVE WON THE ACADEMY AWARD FOR BEST PICTURE OF 1997 INSTEAD OF THAT NUDIE BOAT MOVIE.<br /><br />Although not my personal favorite film of 1997, that honor goes to "Air Force One".<br /><br />I am glad they FINALLY came out with this 2 disc special edition.  SHOULD have come out in 2007 for the 10th anniversary.<br /><br />It was this film I learned about Russell Crowe.  Became a fan at once.  And, another SHOULD, he SHOULD have been nominated an Oscar as well.<br /><br />The cast are perfect in their roles.<br /><br />A flaw.  Did NOT need the nudity in the film.<br /><br />There are good extras in this special edition.  They did a good job with this.<br /><br />Now, the mistakes with the DVD packages.<br />Although it comes with a CD this does NOT make up for these mistakes to me<br />1.  NO chapter list<br />2.  No printed material on the film<br />3.  Badly designed how they input the discs inside the package</p></body></html>

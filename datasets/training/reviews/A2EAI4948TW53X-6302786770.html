<meta name="summary" content="Best western ever!"></head><body><p>The entire trilogy was awesome, but the final of the series is the best.  Clint Eastwood returns as &quot;the man with no name&quot;.  Throw in Eli Wallach as &quot;Tuco&quot; and Lee Van Cleef as &quot; Angel eyes&quot; and you have one hell of a matchup.  The story is a little slow moving at first, but you get hooked.  It somewhat follows the previous movies.  But the character interaction is the best of the three.  The shootouts and unintentional humor make this a classic and must see for fans of the western movie genre.  You can't go wrong with this masterpiece!</p></body></html>

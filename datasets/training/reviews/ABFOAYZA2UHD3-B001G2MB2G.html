<meta name="summary" content="the book cut so bad it makes half sense"></head><body><p>I love HP, don't get me wrong, hence 4 stars.<br />But MY GOD, they get worse and worse compared to the book and compared to the previous films.<br />For a moment after the movie ended i thought it could be cuz we have seen so may effects that we expect more and more every time, but no, i don't think that is the reason for the slight disappointment i felt after having seen the film.<br />Order of Phoenix is a HUGE book, and I am sure we the fans would not mind sittin in the theatre for another half hour, no Sir! So why haven't they made it a little longer and made it more coherent??<br />Even if you have NOT read the book you will notice connections missing, in appearance of characters who are there and you don't know why really and how they happened to be - Luna Lovegood, for instance.<br />Actions follow one another seemingly disconnected while we KNOW how connected everything is in HP..<br />Now that i'm done whining, i'll say that the film is worth seeing whether you are afficionado or not, for its brilliant casting.<br />Snape, Black, Umbridge, McGonagall, Lestrange, Lovegood - brilliant!!!<br />Radclife looks funniest of all the kids, gone all adolescent and staying shortest of them all.<br />Effects are of high standard as always.. but here i have to go back to the whining - IN SHORT: while the HP1 was almost as good as the book played in my head, with HP5 it's not the case. The movie my head played out ofthe book is so much better than the one i saw on screen last week..</p></body></html>

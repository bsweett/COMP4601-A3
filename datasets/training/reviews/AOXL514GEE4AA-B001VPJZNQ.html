In order to get out of the game and open his dream little restaurant, he needs just one more job. He's asked to hunt down and return his boss's son, Travis. What ensues is a action-comedy romp filled with jungle dangers, humping monkeys, local rebels, lost treasure, and a bad-ass Christopher Walken. The movie is totally enjoyable and worth a watch!<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: This disc is a winner! Gorgeous colors that jump out at you and amazing sound! All the special features are carried over. FINAL VERDICT: UPGRADE WORTHY!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="3.5 stars, Dont listen to the Crititc's, it's not that bad!"></head><body><p>After watching the preveiws for "Poseidon" I promised myself that I would go see this film, now after hearing what the Critics had to say about "Poseidon" I REALLY thought about breaking that promise and spending my $6.50 on another film but after somewhat of debate I thought that I would give it a try because there have been some movie I have really liked that the critics didnt ..., now I wouldnt say that about "Poseidon" but I can honestly say that I was entertained, personnaly I thought that this was you besic Popcorn summer movie, it's got exemplary Special-Effects, pretty decent acting, action-packed suspenceful scenes and scenarios & lots of Screaming!, though a few times you feel like you are seeing the same thing over and over again (Talk, Swim, disaster, Scream, Run, Swim, Get Higher, Calm Down, Talk, Disaster, Scream, Run ... ect: you get the picture!), but some parts wre thrilling and even suspencful!. I am not going to lie and say that this film would be good regardless of the budget because that, my dears would be a big fat lie ... because if this movie would'nt have spent the 150,000,000$ that it had, than this film would'nt have been good at all! Overall though everything went pretty smoothly  and the budgets basically fought through the dragging screenplay to put together a decent summer flick, dont see it if your real picky., and certianlly do NOT go into it with the 70's "Poseidon Adventure" in mind because if you do than I can say that you will most definatly be let down.<br /><br />Overall: C+</p></body></html>

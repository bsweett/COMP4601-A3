<meta name="summary" content="Stunning imagery, lackluster script."></head><body><p>Visually, Children of Men is a stunner. It convincingly brings us into the terrorist battlezones of the future, complete with immigrant holding pens and bleak cityscapes that are made all the more plausible by excellent camera handling, and a cold color scheme. The acting ranges from very good (Clive Owen) to so-so (Julianne Moore), but the cast mostly does a fine job with what are ultimately very thin roles. Michael Caine is endearing in an ultimately wispy role as a pot dealing comic artist. It's an eccentric little turn, but reads like a screenwriter piling on eccentricities for their own sake. As a result, in the end, Caine is pleasant, but forgettable.<br /><br />But, the real problem with Children of Men is a story line (not premise, mind you) that simply doesn't flow naturally, It is propelled from point to point by very artificial devices that speak mostly of poor plotting. Serendipitous events jar the characters along, coupled with dialogue that says too much -- with a ring of audience spoon-feeding. A good example of this is when Owen's character overhears a group of bad guys revealing what they did, and what they plan to do with Owen's character "tomorrow." It felt like a cheesy James Bond moment in which the villain explains his "plan" for no purpose other than to given Bond sufficient information to save himself. The script, sadly, has a number of these moments, and the result is a story that never quite coheres, and never lives up to its potential.<br /><br />What Children of Men gets very right, however, are those moments when we feel like this bleak future is very possible -- a fleeting glimpes of a New York City mushroom cloud, a bombing victim cradling her own arm, tanks assaulting a London high-rise. Cuaron's work is like a painting. If only he had a better script to paint.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Up in the Air"></head><body><p>Ryan Bingham who makes his living personally handing out pink slips, he's the top hatchet man at a company that other companies hire when they are downsizing. And since business is booming, his job keeps him on the go constantly. He flies all across the country, staying in a series of nice hotels. And although this itinerant lifestyle prevents him from having any kind of stable, regular life, this doesn't bother him in the slightest, he's thrilled to be a boy in a traveling bubble. "Up in the Air" is so truthful, particularly penetrating and effective movie. Reitman proving to be a force to reckon with and Clooney that he just keeps getting better with age. Very entertaining movie, see for yourself.</p></body></html>

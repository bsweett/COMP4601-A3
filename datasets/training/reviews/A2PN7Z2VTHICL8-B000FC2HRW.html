<meta name="summary" content="Just as good as the first two 'Destination' movies"></head><body><p>A group of seniors on their high school graduation trip are at an amusement park, when Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) has a premonition about the Devil Roller Coaster.  She becomes so upset that seven of the seniors leave the ride, and of course, the premonition of disaster comes true.  Her boyfriend dies in the crash, but Kevin (Ryan Merriman) his best friend lives.  Kevin has done his research, and finds an "urban legend" about a similar occurrence on Flight 180 years ago (a tricky reference to Final Destination #1), warning Wendy that the seven survivors are in danger.<br /><br />At first Wendy disbelieves Kevin, but as after two survivors die in a tanning bed mishap (I loved this scene, especially the fact that they were listening to "Roller Coaster Of Love" while they died), Wendy looks again at the photos taken the night of the crash and decides that the rest of the kids need to be warned.<br /><br />The 'Final Destination' movies are simple, flash-in-the-pan horror flicks with a bunch of teenagers and a bunch of grisly deaths.  This third installment holds true to the format and won't disappoint fans of the first two movies.  Head "poppers" seem to be a favorite of the death scenes.  A special mention goes to actor Kris Lemche as Ian McKinley, my favorite character.<br /><br />One thing Part Three has that the other two didn't is a special interactive feature on the DVD called "Choose Their Fate", which is fun.  I recommend watching the theatrical version first, then have some fun with the "Choices".  The choices don't have much to do with the outcome, but lead to different scenes, and besides, its fun to interact.  Some lengthen and some shorten the theatrical version.  You can also back up the scene and pick differently if you choose.<br /><br />'Final Destination 3' is a solid addition to the first two movies, if you like teenage horror flicks.  Definitely worth a purchase.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

I know that the stars were all part of a generation of actors known for the quality of their work. But something about this movie never made me want to rush to see it. I'm glad that I finally got to it.<br /><br />The film opens with three young friends playing on the street, scraping their names in fresh cement. A police detective gives the kids a hard time for what they are doing and takes the one who doesn't live in the nearby houses home. The truth though is that this is not a policeman and he doesn't take him home. Rather young Dave Boyle is abducted by two pedophiles that he escapes from later.<br /><br />The movie then jumps forward to present day where one of those youngsters now grown, Jimmy Markum (Sean Penn) owns his own market and watches as his daughter goes out for the night before his other daughters first communion. It is the last time he will see her alive. The next day she is found, murdered.<br /><br />This sets about a chain of events and a reunion of sorts for the boyhood pals. The third member of the three is Sean Devine (Kevin Bacon) who is now a detective for the State Police. And the murder falls under his jurisdiction.<br /><br />Young Dave has grown (Tim Robbins) and is still haunted by the experiences of his past. And the night that Jimmy's daughter was murdered Dave saw her and also came home covered in someone else's blood. Putting these items together, Dave's wife Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) begins to wonder about her husband. He claims to have been mugged and to have beaten the mugger to death. But no newspaper articles make her doubt his story.<br /><br />The main portion of the movie moves across the stories of the individuals involved. Jimmy wants vengeance and will do anything to find and kill the person responsible for his daughter's murder. Dave grapples with the demons of his past. And Sean just wants to believe that his friends can't be involved in the murder as he searches for the real killer.  Each becomes a piece of the puzzle, the answer of which is not revealed until films end. But by then, the world is turned upside down and facts are misplaced.<br /><br />While some might have thought this was a simple murder mystery, a whodunit put together by Eastwood, it is much deeper than that. It is a look into the psyche of three very different people who grew up together, who were affected by their past. The inner struggles of all three are different, but all tied into their past as well. And this makes for a drama unlike any mystery could hold.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest thing that this film offers is a ton of outstanding performances that will be hard to match in any current film. An assembly of talent such as this is rare in today's films. Most notable is Sean Penn as the father in turmoil. All accolades he received were well deserved.<br /><br />Make a point of renting this one. You won't be disappointed. And the discovery of just who the killer is, whether it is Dave or perhaps Jimmy's daughter's boyfriend or someone else, makes for a fitting together of clues that mold well. Give this one a watch.</p></body></html>

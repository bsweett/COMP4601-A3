It came with all the extras: -- bonus footage, outtakes,  interviews, marketing goodies, the CD soundtrack, novelization, and a few  other bells and whistles.  Now, some 4 or 5 years later, you lucky DVD  owners can get basically the same thing, minus the soundtrack and  paperback, for a fraction of the cost.  AND IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!!!!!!  If this isn't your favorite movie, I'd be rather curious to know what IS!  The TNT network has run this film many times over the last few years, and  the copy they show has been beautifully restored and the color  &quot;tweaked&quot; a bit.  So just think of how great the DVD version is  gonna look!  And sound! Granted, and by Spielberg's own admission in the  laser's and DVD's accompanying interview footage, JAWS turned out as well  as it did almost by happy accident.  Spielberg initially was counting on  getting a great deal more footage of the mechanical sharks in the film, but  it was not to be (as a few humorous production stories in the interviews  will attest).  So JAWS had to take on a rather Hitchcock-ian feel instead  --  &quot;less is more&quot;, if you will.  Precious little shark footage  until the third act, and virtually every usable piece of mechanical shark  footage that was shot wound up in the film.  So it begs the question:  Is  JAWS as great a film as it is IN SPITE of itself?  Probably.  But who  cares?  Even if you are only a casual fan of this film, you owe it to  yourself to check out all the bonus features that come with this 25th  Anniversary set.  While not boasting as much bonus material as many other  DVDs have (THE ABYSS, ALIEN, the upcoming TERMINATOR 2 COLLECTOR'S  EDITION),  JAWS does have the advantage of being a very big part of  American pop culture, and the insight you can gain to this film from the  DVD extras actually draws you further into an already exciting movie  experience.  Now if we can only convince Universal Pictures to re-release  this film to theatres for this 25th Anniversary year. Even with the bonus  DVD and laserdisc features, this film will always play best in a big, dark,  crowded theater.  We should be able to let our kids experience it that way,  much like George Lucas did when he re-released his trilogy a few years ago.  There is at least one generation of people who never got to see JAWS 20  feet high and 48 feet across. And I challenge you to play this DVD will  full THX or  DTS Surround and NOT GET GOOSEBUMPS when John Williams' score  kicks in!</p></body></html>

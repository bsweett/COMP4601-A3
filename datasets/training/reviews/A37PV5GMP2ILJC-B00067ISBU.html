<meta name="summary" content="A red hot love story"></head><body><p>"There lived a certain man in Russia long ago<br />He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow"<br />("Rasputin" by Boney M)<br /><br />Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):<br /><br />1. German military says "Ra Ra Rasputin" , and tries to open a portal to another dimension<br />2. US Army shows up and all Hellboy breaks loose<br />3. Forget music - it's a Baby Ruth that soothes a savage beast<br />4. Fast forward 60 years and Hellboy and his friends are attached to the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense<br />5. His friends include a fishy character named Abe, and a hot chick named Liz who's in denial<br />6. Rasputin and his gang show up and release a nasty creature named Sammael who goes forth and multiplies<br />7. Newbie from the FBI gets baptism by fire<br />8. Lots of killings follow<br />9. As Inigo Montoya (from Princess Bride) once said (several times) "......Prepare to die"<br /><br />Lots of paranormal stuff, out-of-this-world special effects, and strong performances by Ron Perlman, Selma Blair, John Hurt, Doug Jones and Karel Roden, among others, make for an action-packed fantasy adventure in itself, and recommended viewing before watching Hellboy II<br /><br />A red hot love story that's definitely not a chick flick.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, July 30, 2008</p></body></html>

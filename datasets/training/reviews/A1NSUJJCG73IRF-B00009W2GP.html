<meta name="summary" content="The Matrix Revolutions (2003)"></head><body><p>Director:  The Wachowski Brothers.<br />Cast:  Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie Anne Moss, Jada Pinkett, Hugo Weaving.<br />Running Time: 128 minutes.<br />Rated R for violence and language.<p>While the first two &quot;Matrix&quot; films revolved around the splendid special effects and exceptional kung-fu action that could be presented on a visual screen, &quot;The Matrix Revolutions&quot; is much more plot driven and metaphorically focused.  As far as if it is a fitting end to the trilogy, it depends on what the audience is looking for.  If the audience wants some sort of resolution as far as whether Zion survives the attack of the machines and if the Matrix is destroyed, then perhaps the trilogy is complete; however, if the audience is looking for a concise, clear-cut ending...not so fast.<p>The story takes place approximately moments after &quot;Reloaded&quot; ended.  Neo, played by Keanu Reeves in perhaps his best performance of the three films, finds himself in an in-between world in which he has to return in order to save Zion from destruction.  Morpheus and Trinity (Fishburne and Moss, respectively) come to the rescue, but there are bigger problems.  Mr. Smith (Weaving) has used the Matrix as his playing field to create thousands of Smith Agents, all of which are going to be used to destory not only Zion, but all of mankind as well.  Thus, the much expected colassal clash between Neo and Smith--and they certainly do not disappoint.<p>Without the incredible kung-fu scenes and amazing chase sequences, &quot;Revolutions&quot; seems more like &quot;Aliens&quot; in a coma.  There is a pivotal thirty minute segement of the film in which Zion battles the machines, but the Wachowski brothers fail to cut back to Neo and his mates during the whole period.  These battles scenes are entertaining, but they are not what made the first two films enjoyable.  Obviously, the story is essential--but the script is so torn between either portraying this powerful, faithful metaphor of the Bible or emphasizing crazy, out-of-your-seats, karate-fighting, plane exploding, human flying, building-destroying outrageousness.<p>Overall, &quot;Revolutions&quot; is the weakest of the trilogy because of the Wachowski brothers' attempt to sneak in symbolism into a film series that was certainly entertaining enough without it.  &quot;The Matrix&quot; was filled with wonder and special effects, &quot;Reloaded&quot; had perhaps the best action sequence ever recorded on film, yet there is nothing that special or memorable about &quot;Revolutions&quot;.  It is not a film that is going to change a person's life or faith--it will satisfy those who are fans of the series.</p></body></html>

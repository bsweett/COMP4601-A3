I'm not sure if its adapted from a book but it does indeed nail that sucker for emotion in me. Joan Allen acted rather well. I dont know why a certain reviewer is praising Kevin Costner. His role isnt all that substantial and since when is playing a drunk difficult? Joan Allen's character suffers from alcahol plus broken home induced anger. Although she doesnt slap people and scream, her behaviour is erratic because she cannot digest the fact that her husband has left her. She plays the mother of four beautiful girls who lives very different lives. I fell in love with the character of Emily for it was realistic and loveable.<br /><br />Does the movie deserve to be purchased?<br /><br />I'm not quite sure on this one although I do know that anyone who's a half movie watcher would have a good time watching it. Do watch the trailer to know what to expect. This movie has no comedy and it isnt something a family would sit and watch together. However, if you are a loner like me then I suggest you watch it right away.<br /><br />For some reason beyond my understanding of me, my favourite scene in the film was the one where the family goes to watch a dance and are sitting in the audience. That's what made me go WHOA since it's just ideal in realising an emotional gulp in one's own self.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Cat and mouse board a plane...."></head><body><p>I finally managed to get my hands on the DVD and enjoyed curling up to it on what proved to be a snowy winter wonderland outside my window.<br /><br />Wes Craven is perhaps known for cheesy teenage type movies, and while this is definitely in his character it was pretty entertaining and it was enough for me and my boyfriend, who liked it even more than me, to sit back and watch it and then to agree that we both liked it.<br /><br />Rachel McAdams was genuine, fresh and pretty: she conveyed many emotions with her face and tear streaked eyes, as Cyclops like with his polarizing blue eyes Cillian Murphy went from a friendly fellow passenger to a heartless man who held her and her fathers future in his palm. He knew how she liked her eggs cooked at 3 am, who broke her heart, what her father watched on TV and where she lived, as he knew exactly how to control this one person in order to carry out a grander evil plan.<br /><br />Since there are only so many things that she could do on the plane, it's up to her wit and personal strength to try and save the day. She doesn't give up, while we did watch her fail in many attempts, and how Murphy made her pay for it, it was a great movie. Renting it before a purchase is probably a good idea, because as wasn't predictable, it did seem to go in the favor of McAdams in the few scenes when she conquers some unusual obstacles.<br /><br />Overall a fun movie, interesting looking actors, some espionage moves and plenty of chases.</p></body></html>

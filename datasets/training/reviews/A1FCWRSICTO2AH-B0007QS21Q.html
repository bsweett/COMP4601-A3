Smith is so bad, that you have to wonder if acting with computer generated robots was a factor -- but that shouldn't be it, since he's been in a number of films with loads of special effects, and done pretty well for himself. Smith's performance is off, in the sense that he always seems distracted or even bored. It's like he's always cutting a look toward a mirror -- yep, pecs look good. On the good side of things are the robots. Their faces are remarkable in their ability to convey emotion. The trailers for the film don't do them justice. The plot is kind of muddled, but there are a couple of standout action scenes, in particular the chase in the tunnel, that help to raise this movie into the should-see category. But a few good scenes do not make a good movie. Probably the most over-hyped movie of the last year.  Note: Will, take an acting class.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Blood Diamond Runs Deep!"></head><body><p>Even though Leonardo DiCaprio proves here he yet again that, like Brad Pitt, he is much more than a pretty boy. He can actually act!<br /><br />Insofar as playing and pulling off a mercenary, my choice would have been someone like Hugh Jackman, but Leo utilizes other aspects other than physical presense to pull this off. Our hats off to him!<br /><br />Blood Diamond's director Edward Zwick did another fantastic job here. We loved his The Last Samurai, with Tom Cruise. Yet another fantastic thinking man's action flick.<br /><br />Blood Diamond also has the unusual unsappy love story, which is a much more realistic way to approach such things. Beautiful cinemetography, savage tribes and warlords abound here, showing the mostly unknowledgeable viewing audience of such real-life happenings in the world today. Brilliantly done.<br /><br />I was not expecting something so fresh and exciting in this film. Even my wife was spellbound, expecting a typical action movie. It is anything but!<br /><br />Africa is shown here in all its beauty and savagery, both in its locales and people, whether white or black. With its superlative storytelling, strong performances, excellent action sequences, and differing locales of harsh living and lush beauty, Blood Diamond delivers on many levels.<br /><br />This movie alone has changed the diamond trade, moving alot of people from purchasing diamonds from just anywhere and from just anyone. It teaches people to ask the right questions, regarding just from how and where any said diamond is from.<br /><br />That's just powerful movie making.</p></body></html>

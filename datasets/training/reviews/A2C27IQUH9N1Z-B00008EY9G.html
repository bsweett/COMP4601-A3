<meta name="summary" content="Psycho meets Ten Little Indians"></head><body><p>As if Psycho weren't enough to scare you off rundown motels in the rain, Identity comes along to drive the point home.  This is a solid thriller with a great cast.  You'd have to include the storm as a character, since it is the rain that drives ten strangers to a decrepit motel in the desert, and the lightning and drenching water are a constant presence as bodies begin to turn up and tensions heighten.  Toward the end there are, of course, two main twists -- one works very well, the other is goofy and predictable, though it doesn't spoil the film.  While it wasn't the best thriller I've ever seen, it was not merely a slasher film either -- something I was counting on based on John Cusack's presence -- and when the movie was over I didn't feel ripped off.  I always enjoy Cusack, the rest of the cast was great, the editing was very good, and the premise was quite interesting.<p>Extra features include a director's commentary, a trailer, a featurette, 4 deleted scenes, a (slightly) extended ending, storyboard comparisons and a filmography for some of the cast and crew members.  Audio and subtitles are available in English or French.<p>Solid.  Creepy.  Not for kids.</p></body></html>

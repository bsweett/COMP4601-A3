<meta name="summary" content="One of the best adventure films of the 60s."></head><body><p>This movie may not be the best in special effects, but there is something about it that makes you like it.  Charlton Heston and Roddy Macdowell do really well.  The plot is very interesting, and original.  The atmosphere the movie brings is unlike anyfilm.  The planet is like earth, but very out of this world.  See the film.  Is a must see for any adventure fan.  I highly reccomend this film.</p></body></html>

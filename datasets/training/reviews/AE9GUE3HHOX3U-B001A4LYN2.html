<meta name="summary" content="No Country For Old Men"></head><body><p>This is a fantastic film, a sort of study on the character defects we all possess.  The dark side of humanity exposed, flaws illuminated like skin under florescent lighting.  Faith tested and put under scrutiny and later proven.  Tough questions asked but never answered.  Egos bashed and bruised.  Boys turned into men, unwillingly.  These are some of the topics covered in "There Will Be Blood", subtle and sometimes blatant, it sneaks into your brain like a slow poison.  "There Will be Blood" is old school cinema.  It's not brainless violence, super hero melodrama.  It's storytelling and character driven.  The score is fantastic as well, casting a sureal vibe to a story that is as old as time, ego and greed.</p></body></html>

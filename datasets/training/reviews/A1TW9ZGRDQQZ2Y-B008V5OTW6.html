<meta name="summary" content="Spielberg is Back on Top"></head><body><p>After the average SFX thriller, War of the Worlds, Munich is another notch in Steven Spielberg's impressive career. The acting is great all around, especially Eric Bana in a break out role, and the direction is top of the line. The pacing was a little slower than expected and it did drag at times (hence the 4 stars), but overall Munich was an important movie that shows the pros and cons of revenge. I would wait for DVD, but if you have already seen everything out there (like me), this one is worth catching if you got the 3 hours to spare.</p></body></html>

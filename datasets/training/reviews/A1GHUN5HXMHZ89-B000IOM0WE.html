Nothing worse than people that want you to see their bold reviewing vision and then they slap someone in the face with a sexist/elderly discremination remark. Gee, like only the MTV generation understands Science Fiction and this movie. Funny but last time I checked Sci Fi was around and being read long before even I was born let alone someone such as yourself. I was probably reading Isaac Asimov before you were born, so what does that prove? One thing, I have learned age and sex have nothing to do with how people interpret SciFi. Now that we got that out of the way, this is a good movie. Some are being overly critical because of the predictable invulnerability of Aeon and how it is overly easy for her to take out everyone else. I too must admit it was a touch heavy handed, but then so was "The Matrix". The faults are minor when you consider the quality of the story, action, and the effects. Take time to watch it a second time and reflect on it before being so harsh.<br /><br />This movie may seem simple to some, but it has a good deal under the surface. One critical viewer went on about the blimp used to hide the DNA instead of a vault being stupid. I say, not at all. Hiding in plain sight is often quite smart. No one would expect something of great value in a blimp that could be easily shot down or boarded, and the keeper was there to make it seem like something ordinary. Another indicated this was new for a woman to strike out for her believes. Nothing new about a young woman striking out for her believes. Most recently I recall "Underworld" using that plotline, and then there was "Final Fantasy", et cetera, but I digress. The story is different in the respect of a different look at a future society. As mentioned previously by a couple truly open minded reviews, that is a tough nut to crack. "Logan's Run" 30 years later still looks okay even if the effects seem a bit hokey. It holds up because of what they tried to say, not because the F/X were not extreme. SciFi fans will probably like it best, but anyone with an open mind may find it entertaining. I suggest renting before buying. Personally I liked the acting and story so much I am buying it. The trailers did not do this movie justice. They make it look like a mindless action movie. There is much more to it than just some good action and special effects.</p></body></html>

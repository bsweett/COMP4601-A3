A film that shows both sides of the conflict and does not glorify what is in fact  a battle of wits with your personal life falling apart at the same time. This Film just shows what happens when you get a great story and let it ride. Couple it with an outstanding cast, great photography, direction, scene location and a just wonderful music backup & it can't help but kick butt. A job well done to all hands!</p></body></html>

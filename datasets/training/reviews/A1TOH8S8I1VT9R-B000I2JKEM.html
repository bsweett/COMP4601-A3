Though I have not read all of the reviews here, I have not found one that really makes it clear what an artistic achievement this film really is.  "Oh it's a kid's film that's too scary for kids"; is a fairly common criticism.  Complaints of its brevity have come from lovers and haters alike.  Some criticize the music's lack of "hook".  But I have not read the review that exclaims what brilliant art this really is (I apologize to those reviews I may have missed).  So, I'm adding one here to ensure that it is not beyond reach so late in the game (300 reviews can be daunting).  Let's get on with it...<br /><br />-TECHNICAL ACHEIVMENT<br />Many people have made mention of the "making of" featurettes on this DVD.  They may have told you what they saw but never explained its significance (or really understood it).  In simple terms, this is digital animation.  With off-the-shelf software, a good digital camera (still camera) and a decent posable doll, you could do the same thing in your basement.  However, what was done hear technically rivals anything done before it.  Not even Ray Harryhausen, THE visual FX master that influenced generations of those in the art ever achieved anything of such explicit detail and subtlety.  We can marvel at the technical complexity and brilliance of the "puppets" but totally miss why they are complex; expressive motion.<br /><br />-WHAT MAKES GREAT ANIMATION?<br />Some mistakenly assume that if the animation is smooth and fluid, then it is good animation; particularly when it comes to stop motion animation.  Well, that's partially true.  Making something move smoothly certainly helps convince us that it has life.  Yet, organic life isn't always smooth or regular; we bounce and stumble and jerk and shake.  We have weight and we create momentum and everything else physics brings to bear.  The animators in Corpse Bride understood this as much as any Disney animator ever did.  I think Ray H. understood this too but never had the technology and backing to ever get this level of detail with Stop Motion Animation.  Stop Motion fans adore and appreciate What Ray Harryhausen accomplished, but surely should recognize what's been achieved here.  These characters bounce and wiggle and exhibit weight and emotion.  Facial ticks and expressiveness only dreamed of in the past are taken for granted in this film simply because it is completely unobtrusive and natural.  Yet, we may never see this level of art in stop motion ever again.<br /><br />-IS SIMPLE BAD?<br />I think a film that can turn the concept of a man accidentally marrying a corps into a 75 minute story is commendable.  This film never seams too short for me.  Some stories are as long as they need to be.  There is nothing complex about this film other than the emotions of the characters.  It's all too clear; the mundane existence of the everyday life is drowned in a sepia grey tints and superficial existence.  The enlightened existence of the pain free underworld is lavished in color, friendship and merriment.  Despite and because of this, true love will blossom; nothing wrong with that.  Simple can be bad if you don't like the concept to begin with.  I like dark stories that teach us something about ourselves and this does that in spades.<br /><br />-"EMOTIONLESS, SHALLOW CHARACTERS."????<br />Sorry, I read that somewhere here at amazon.com.  Well, I obviously could not disagree more.  To be fair you can't watch this film once and know all the characters; it's not that easy.  Some of the characters are emotionless and shallow by design, so I have to give a sideways nod to that statement, but I don't think the criticisms were aimed at those characters.  The first time I saw this at the theater I was very conflicted.  I criticized many of the same things others did.  I didn't get the characters.  It had a strange mood to it.  The music was completely unexpected.  But a good film proves itself in repeat viewings. After a couple of viewings, I felt that I knew all the characters personally.  I thought all the voice actors proved perfect.  I actually enjoy the songs now.  Perhaps this film isn't as simple as people say?<br /><br />-MY RECOMMENDATION<br />  This is a fairly simple concept which is complex in its subtlties and may not satisfy everyone.  The music takes getting used to but can grow on you.  If you don't like dark fables told in animated films you should avoid this.  If you don't give a care for animation one way or the other then you probably won't think much of this.  If you are a fan of Stop Motion Animation then you really need to see this; if for no other reason than to appreciate the artistic and technical achievement, it will have been worth it.  The DVD has ample extras and a beautiful picture.  This film is one that grows in depth and enjoyment every time I watch it. As a fan of Stop Motion Animation I now revel in it.</p></body></html>

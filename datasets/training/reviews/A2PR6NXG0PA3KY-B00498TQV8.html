And what do those diverse places share? Drugs! Pot-growing, methamphetamine cooking, crack and crank, drug selling, attended with desperation and violence. Drug addiction is not just a big city problem, and in fact it's not a problem limited to the outcasts, misfits, deadbeats, and indocumentados. There are plenty of big shot and fat cat users whose buying power fuels the gang wars of Mexico and funds the Taliban. And the 'moral turpitude' of the narcotics business isn't any more characteristic of liberals than of reactionaries, Blue States than Red, atheists than fundamentalists. In fact, statistics suggest that the fastest growing drug problem in the USA is meth addiction in socially conservative small towns in parts of the country that are supposed to be apple-pie wholesome and old-fashioned in values, towns where your image of the American Dream would include a white steepled church.<br /><br />"Winter's Bone" is about an impoverished 'community' in the Missouri Ozarks, where all the men are up to their tailbones in drugs not only using them but 'cooking' them. Even those on the the "other team" -- the sheriff, the bail bondsmen, etc. -- in a sense depend on drugs indirectly, and exhibit the same angry out-for-themselves immorality. Jessup Dolly, a tough customer even by the standards of his hard-bitten hill-folk clan, has disappeared just a few days before his scheduled trial for drug production. The problem is that he posted bail using the title to his shabby house and the scrub forest lot around it. His seventeen-year-old daughter, Ree, is informed that if Jessup skips his court appointment, the family will be evicted from their home. Ree's mother is already suffering a psychotic withdrawal, and there are two younger children in Ree's care as well. Ree goes looking for her father, despite the warnings of her closest kin and neighbors that finding him will be mortally dangerous. Ree turns out to be determined, intrepid, tough -- a "Dolly bred and buttered" as she says. What she finds eventually is not pleasant.<br /><br />But "Winter's Bone" is not just about drug violence and a brave girl solving a mystery. Really it's more about concepts of loyalty, honor, and family cohesiveness. Nearly everyone in Ree's world is related to her by blood, and "blood" is supposed to be thicker than money or law. Ree learns that it isn't, and then again it is. "Honor" in her language means absolute solidarity against all outsiders. Ree's survival depends on the degree to which her neighbors are certain that she's "a girl who won't tell nothing to nobody."<br /><br />Actress Jennifer Lawrence plays Ree Dolly perfectly. John Hawkes is equally convincing as Jessup's fierce, scrawny older brother. Honestly, everyone in the cast of this film is "real" in his or her role. There's not a fleck of sentimentality or caricature in their performances. Good dialogue, good camera work, good editing produce a film that deserved the "Best Picture" award it won at the 2010 Sundance Festival.<br /><br />That's well and good, but my own 5-star enthusiasm for this film results from its realism as a fictional documentary of one portion of the America "we" live in. Some of the details of the film are gristly in the extreme, yet not implausible. Life does get ugly when lives are not so precious in themselves. This film doesn't exaggerate. The "Dollys" may not be average mainstream Americans but they are not disappearingly uncommon either. "Winter's Bone" is a gripping dramatic experience, but it's also a window into a painful sector of American society.</p></body></html>

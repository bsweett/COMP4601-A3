<meta name="summary" content="Born to be Wild  Hog"></head><body><p>Four suburban friends who have in common the love for their motorcycles and who call themselves Wild Hogs (Tim Allen, Martin Lawrence, William H. Macy and John Travolta), one sunny summer morning jump on their bikes, throw away all four cell phones and leave their worries, bills, routine and safety of their subdivision behind to face the adventure and to ride from Cincinnati to California. On their way, they cross paths with a real thing, an intimidating band of New Mexico bikers known as the Del Fuegos and their bad-to-the-bone leader, Ray Liotta. Jack and his buddies do not like middle-class suburbanites -amateur bikers, and a lot of misadventures ensue as the result of their meeting.<br /><br />I think the movie is better than majority of critics giving it credit for. The soundtrack contains classic rock songs. Along with the "Wild Hogs" gang we would pass and enjoy the beautiful scenery on the way from Ohio to the Pacific coast. The movie has even a class act in the end when the obligatory Deus ex machine shows up in the small charming town Madrid, New Mexico to settle all the scores and to stop the war between Wild Hogs and Del Fuegos. Peter Fonda's appearance immediately brings to mind another cross-country motorcycle adventure that happened almost forty years ago.<br /><br />I would not stay in line to the theater to see this comedy there, and I did not even know when it was released. One of my husband's coworkers, a biker himself who liked the movie, gave us the DVD which we watched on Saturday night and had a good time. No, it is not a subtle, witty and sophisticated comedy but so what? Even if many of the situations and the jokes were predictable, they were funny enough to keep this viewer (and her husband) smiling and rooting for Wild Hogs.<br /><br />2.75/5</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Biography or Ideology?"></head><body><p>An interesting buddy movie with a twist.  It seems to want to gain sympathy for Ernesto, but it does so in an uneven way, with fits and starts.  As the two friends travel north they seem to encounter more and more primitive, or as the movie says, indigenous peoples, and each encounter shows people in poorer straits than the last.  Finally, they come upon the most hopeless of all, in quarantine.  Along the way the buddies lie and cheat their way from one situation to another, until Ernesto tells a benefactor what he thinks about his newly written novel, which is the first piece of honesty that comes across in the movie.<br /><br />The end of the movie presents the fates of the two guys, implying that, Eernesto at least, has gone off for some noble purpose and has been done in by the "evil" USA.<br /><br />I imagine that the purpose of the book was to place Enrnesto in a generous light, but that just didn't work.  He turned out to be anything but an admirable figure and in life worked towards the enslavement or death of thousands of people, if not millions.<br /><br />The movie should have focused on biography or on ideology, but mixing in both didn't work.</p></body></html>

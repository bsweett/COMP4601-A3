<meta name="summary" content="Far beyond the honor!"></head><body><p>In ancient China two Wudan warriors will intend to retrieve a legendary and mythic sword which has been stolen.<br /><br />Basically this is the dramatic premise but there are a lot of little details to find out. The master voice and dazzling presence of Yimou Zhang behind camera is enough to captive and bewitch the most exigent viewer. His powerful expressive force and his well known touch of genius may be felt from the first shot.<br /><br />Ang Lee has remained in the great tradition of the "shaman filmmakers" if I may. In this reduced as you may figure out are Kenji Mizoguchi, Akira Kurosawa, Shohei Imamura, Kinugasa, Kobayashi and Ichikawa, just to name the most conspicuous in the East cinematography.<br /><br />Lee `s ambitious script capture images and transform them in poetry, the admirable flight combats, the delirious traveling and the charming portrait which blends, myth, humanity, honor, humor and dignity. This film overcomes its own latitudes as a true masterpiece to inscribe itself in the list of the new classics from its instantaneous release.</p></body></html>

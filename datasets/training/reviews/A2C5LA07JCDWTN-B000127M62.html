I have been a lifelong fan of both series and have been waiting literally 18 years for this film. The plot is simple yet intriguing: the residents of Elm Street (and town) have been forced to forget Freddy Kruger by being drugged and having their memories erased, thus leaving Freddy powerless to enter their dreams. So Freddy, scours the bowels of hell searching for a soul he can manipulate into bringing fear into the Elm Street teens. Well, no one is more fiercesome than Jason Voorhees. Freddy poses as Jason's dead mother and implores him to kill all the naughty children of Elm Street. The problem is that Jason is sort of like a bag of Lays potato chips, he can't KILL just one. He goes berserk and starts killing everyone, even the victims Freddy intends to kill, thus causing a showdown. The problem with Freddy Vs Jason lies in the absence of screen time for both protagonists, instead we are forced to listen to and follow the stupid teens. However, the film does pick up in it's final 45 minutes enough to rescue the movie as a whole. The fight scenes between Kruger and Voorhees are magical and sent chills up my spine. I would not have had any problem watching these two slice and dice each other for the whole film. The final battle is truly awesome but the best fight scene lies in the showdown in Jason's dream. A sequel is all but assured by the last scene which is great, but as another reviewer wrote why not add another psycho to the mix like Michael Myers, Pinhead or Leatherface, it would only make us fans of the genre that much more pumped for the sequel. Highly Recommended.</p></body></html>

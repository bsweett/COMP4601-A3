<meta name="summary" content="Burton is back"></head><body><p>I was worried when this movie was out.  Though for many years he was known as the director with the midas touch, his two most recent films(Planet of the Apes, Sleepy Hollow), were neither the commercial success that was predicted, nor pleasing to his fans.  This was all changed with Big Fish, a harkening back to the style that made him famous.<br /><br />The movie is based off the relationship between a father(Ed Bloom: Ewan MaCgregor and Albert Finney) and his son Will(Billy Crudup).  The relationship is a strange one, Will has little knowlege of who his father is, his father is given to telling tall tales.  He has done this all his life, and seems to revel in being the center of attention.  But his son tires of it and after an arguement they break contact.  Until his mother calls telling him that his father is dying, and she thinks he should come home.<br /><br />Ed Bloom then starts to tell his various life stories to his sons wife.  They are all tall tales, and distinctly American in flavor.  They range from a witch in the swamp that had a glass eye that you can see the time and manner of your death, to strange town in the boonies called Specter(you never leave because it is so perfect.  These stories are done in the tall tale fashion, Ed Bloom always seems to have the answer and always comes off as charasmatic and virtuous.  Ewan MacGregor always seems to have a grin on his face.  But they all have the traditional Burton style of warped humor.<br /><br />This is a much mellower and more family based than some of his movies, ie the dark fairy tale "Edward Scissorhands" or insane BettleGuise.  Some of the stories still have that edge, ie the poor man living in the shadow of Bloom all his life and eventually has his woman stolen from him by Bloom, or the chinese singers who are also siamese twins.  But the stories are usually upbeat and have a positive nature to them.  His character is also made up to be the archtypical American Hero for that era.  He is a sports star, good looking, charasmatic, brave, earned his own way, and served in the war receiving honors returning to his wife after it was all over.<br /><br />The acting was good all around, and well cast.  Ewan McGregor played his role excellently with the wide smile and thick sounthern accent.  Helen Carter has two small but memorable roles and the girl who had a crush on Bloom and the witch.  Danny Devito looks like he is having too much fun as the circus manager Amos Callaway.<br /><br />The movie was surreal as any of Tim Burtons movies are, but he didn't let it cut into the movies emotional content.  Which was the connection that the father had with his son and wife.  Many consider this movie a tear jerker towards the end.  Making this a great movie for a broad audience, families, couples, or fanatics of Burton's cinematic vision.</p></body></html>

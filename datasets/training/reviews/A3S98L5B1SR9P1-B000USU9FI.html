<meta name="summary" content="One of Denzel's Best"></head><body><p>I think that this is Denzel's best move in a while. Yeah, okay, "Man On Fire" was good, and so was "Out Of Time", but this one, is the best of his recent films. There is no way you could miss any part of this blockbuster smash. Props to the director (Johnathan Demme). I give this movie a perfect five and if you could go higher, I would. This is a must see movie. It will have you glued to your seat. You won't even want to go to the restroom. You got to check it out for yourself.</p></body></html>

On the one hand we have a social satire, that takes a comic look back at successful young Wall Street types of the 80's. This story focuses on a group of friends who are always trying to one up each other with their lavish lifestyles. The over personification of these guys is totally laughable as they are so highly competetive that even the look of their business cards becomes an obsession with them.<br /><br />On the other hand we have, Patrick Bateman, the most obsessive of them all. Patrick's problems go much deeper than his need to compete. His appetite for the best things in life, takes us into the deep dark world of a serial killer. Patrick goes on chilling murder spree that rivals 'Freddy" and "Jason' and will have you on the edge of your seat. Even with a detective questioning his every move, his urge to kill is uncontrollable.<br /><br />These two storylines constantly intertwining, made this a tough one for me to reconcile. Adjusting to the change of mood in every other scene made it hard to enjoy this otherwise well made film.<br /><br />The cast including Christian Bale as the psychotic Bateman,Willem Dafoe(who didn't get nearly enough screen time), as the persistent detective, Reese Witherspoon as the immaculate fiancee,Chloe Sevigny,Jared Leto, Josh Lucas and Samantha Mathis are all impeccable in their performances. Wonderful camera work by Andrzej Sekula and the music of John Cale help make this film worth the view. It is also a film that will leave you wanting to talk about it afterwards, as there may be different interpretations on the final outcome(this is something I always enjoy). And all those things together are definately worth at least 3 stars in my book.<br /><br />The DVD is excellent. The surround sound is fabulous in DD5.1. The picture is beautifully presented in anamorphic widescreen. There are captions in English and may also be viewed in French(also 5.1). There are several special feautres including an interview with Christian Bale, a making of featurette(these were a big help in understanding this film), some production notes and a theatrical trailer.<br /><br />Worth checking out for those that have a taste for something different. Thanks.....Laurie</p></body></html>

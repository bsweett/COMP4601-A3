<meta name="summary" content="It matters how you look at it"></head><body><p>There are two ways to look at this movie;<br /><br />1) Taken as a serious film, it's ridiculously<br />  stupid. I mean this movie is aimed at the<br />  lowest common denominator. It' so<br />  unbelievable that it's practially a live<br />  action cartoon. Other than the Jolie<br />  character, the other characters are idiotic,<br />  especially the Liev Schrieber one.<br /><br />2) Viewed as a "guilty pleasure", this is a fun<br />  piece of mondo trash. Angelina Jolie is<br />  super sexy, makes as good as a heroine as<br />  any, the action sequences are thrilling and<br />  the plot turns are akin to pro wrestling.<br /><br />I do not condone the use of controlled substances but this is essentially "pot"/drunkard  entertainment. It's the type of movie where , if you just catch snippets, it's good enough. This is not a movie that you need to view from start to finish.<br /><br />If there would have been some choice nudity, then it really would have upped the trash-o-meter a la "Showgirls"</p></body></html>

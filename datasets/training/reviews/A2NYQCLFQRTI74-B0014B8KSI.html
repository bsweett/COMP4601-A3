Don't get me wrong, it's a great story, but it's been done so many times, that in the end... it gets boring.<br /><br />I did not find Clooney's acting to be out of this world or even extraordinary. I found it quite plain and void of feelings. Didn't feel any interest in any of the characters.<br /><br />I also didn't understand why Swinton got an Oscar, she didn't give that great a performance.<br /><br />I did enjoy the cinematography, the editing, Tom Wilkinson's acting, and the last scene between Clooney and Swinton.<br /><br />That said, don't watch if you're tired, as the film can be slow at times.</p></body></html>

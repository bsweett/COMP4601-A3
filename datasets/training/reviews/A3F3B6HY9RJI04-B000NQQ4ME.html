<meta name="summary" content="Over-Hyped and Violent"></head><body><p>This is the story of a Mayan who escapes captivity to return to the pregnant wife and son he has hidden in a well.  Usually it is the kind of story that I love but this movie seemed more interested in showing needless violence than in telling the story.<br /><br />There was a lot of hype for this movie, especially since this is the follow-up of Mel Gibson's incredible movie "The Passion".  But when the closing credits started rolling the person I was sitting next to asked, "What was the point of this?"  I could give no good answer.<br /><br />But in the heart of Mel's other movies (like Braveheart), the cinematography is amazing.  Even the story is fantastic but the end resolution left me a little bit in disbelief.  I'm still looking forward to more movies from Mel Gibson but in the end I wish I had just stayed home this time around.</p></body></html>

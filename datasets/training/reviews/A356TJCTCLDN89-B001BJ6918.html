<meta name="summary" content="Not as good as Kill Bill 1"></head><body><p>I loved Kill Bill. The fight scene with the Crazy 88s goes down in my memory as one of the greatest I've ever seen, and that last battle with Oren was sad and beautiful and incredibly fierce.  I wanted to love Kill Bill 2 but frankly, it just doesn't measure up. It's like Tarantino gave the best of what he had to the first movie and threw in some cold leftovers for the second.<br /><br />There is only one good fight scene in Bill 2. When Elle and the Bride get together in Bud's foul little trailer it's a doozy but the audience has to wait a long, long time for it. Here's one small nitpick. Why did Elle introduce Bud to the Black Mamba? I would've preferred to see the Bride get her rematch with him.<br /><br />Part of the problem with this moive is that the China scenes should've been shorter and part of it is that Bill is shown too early. It would've been much better we didn't get to see the snake charmer fully until the last chapter. And speaking of the last chapter I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who wasn't happy with the incedibly wimpy way things went down with Bill.<br /><br />The Bride goes through hell and dishes it out to all the DIVAS and has like five seconds of fight with the Man himself. What a let down! I suspect Tarantino knew he could'nt pull off another Oren/Bride type of triumph so he did a quickie meeting with Bill but that stinks. The audience has sat and waited for this meeting and it doesn't meet expectations.<br /><br />Yes, I was happy with the ending and the clever bit of music and last shots of the actors but that final scene with Bill is so bad it destroys the movie. I bought Kill Bill 1 and its soundtrack. I will  not be doing that with Kill Bill 2.</p></body></html>

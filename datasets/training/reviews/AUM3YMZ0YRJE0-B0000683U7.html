<meta name="summary" content="the best spy suspense film ever made"></head><body><p>There are few films I have in my film library that is as consistently pleasing as this one.  Even though we have nearly memorized every detail, each time it is as fresh, intelligent, funny, and suspenseful as ever.  This is one of our all-time favorites.<br /><br />RoT, the normal man played by Cary Grant, is one of Hitch's greatest creations.  He is naive about the situation he has fallen into, but turns out to be resourceful and intelligent enough to stay alive through the most daunting of threats.  In the beginning, his skeptical mother is there making sarcastic comments about his explanations with a low key matronly scorn.  But RoT is also full of dark humor, even in the ruses he employs to escape or save his skin.  The disorderly scene in the auction house, for example, is absolutely classic and we laugh at it every time.  Grant's timing is perfect.  Then, when he buys in to what is happening, he takes the initiative with admirable cunning.  Even the love scenes and the exquisite chemistry between Grant and Eva Marie Saint are believable.  The other actors, such as Landau, are first rate.<br /><br />Though produced at a more innocent time when the CIA was generally in a more positive light than it is today, Hitch's touch makes it instantly suspect to the point that the viewer will question its competence and motives.  In a way, the spy they are chasing is more sympathetic, and certainly has more style.<br /><br />Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.  It is a true classic.</p></body></html>

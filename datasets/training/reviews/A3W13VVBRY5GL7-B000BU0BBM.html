<meta name="summary" content="Four-star production design makes a one-star picture"></head><body><p>Terry Gilliam's movies are so, so hit-and-miss. 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail', 'Life of Brian' and 'Brazil', all big hits. 'Jabberwocky', 'The Adventures of Baron Munchausen' and 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' - big misses.<br /><br />Sadly, the troubled and much-touted 'The Brothers Grimm', thanks to a really awful script and some dodgy pacing, falls firmly and squarely into the Miss category, with little apart from the exquisite production design saving it from total worthlessness.<br /><br />Matt Damon and Heath Ledger as Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm are charlatans: creating monsters and terrorising various townships with them, our would-be demon-slaying brothers charge an arm and a leg to vanquish these nasties. Caught red-handed by French nobleman Delatombe (Johnathan Price, in an uncharacteristically awful performance, with an even worse accent) and his macho, bungling lieutenant Cavaldi ('Constantine's Satan), they are sent to solve the mystery of missing children in a small village, or they'll be killed. Upon their arrival, and aided by the beautiful-but-aloof Angelika (Lena Headey), they discover that yes, real fairytale creatures do exist, and yes, more than fake weaponry and brotherly rivalry will be needed to destroy the curse of the evil Mirror Queen (Monica Bellucci).<br /><br />Damon and Ledger give gung-ho, ordinary performances, as does Headey, as the trio of heroes at the centre of the tale. Baddies Price and Cavaldi, having obvious trouble with their fake accents, annoy the viewer rather than inspire dislike, and Bellucci's part is so small as to be merely perfunctory, as opposed to the whole reason for the plot. On the acting front, then, nothing major occurs.<br /><br />Direction, too, is disjointed and stop-startish. There's no real momentum to build, with the story flip-flopping between the stronghold of Delatombe and the troubled village and its surrounding forests. It's difficult enough to retain our attention in an oftentimes confusing plot that mashes several elements from many well-loved fairytales together (Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel, Jack and the Beanstalk, The Golden Goose, Hansel and Gretel, and more...), but when the story lacks a definete beginning, middle and end, as this does, it becomes very difficult indeed to remain interested in the antics of, it must be said, pretty unoriginal characters.<br /><br />The production design, on the other hand, is magnificent, and the grandiose, detail-laden visual design and treatment of 'The Brothers Grimm' is a triumph. Here's a real sense of Fairytales-Gone-Bad, and the costumes, effects and scenery all marry together to create a believable and powerful atmosphere that's the only real reason to keep watching.<br /><br />Overall, 'The Brothers Grimm' isn't a great movie, but, if flashy visuals and attention to detail are your thing, then you might be able to overlook the many other weak elements of the actual script and story.</p></body></html>

I am a fan of Bryan Singer's work, but the new director did a pretty good job of maintaining the flow and feel of the last two films. The special effects are amazing and the film is well casted. Even Halle Berry redeems herself here for her less than average performances of Storm in the last two movies. The new mutants are all interesting, but old favorites like Wolverine and Magneto are still the focus. Jean Grey gets much more screen time, as Wolverine did in X2 (when it was about his backstory), but characters like Cyclops are still given nothing to do. Everybody in my sold out theater seemed to love it just as much as I did. The end credits may be long, but if you stay you will get a surprising 15 second scene that will leave you wondering...is this really the end of the X-Men franchise?</p></body></html>

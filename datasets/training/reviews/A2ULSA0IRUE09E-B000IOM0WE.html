<meta name="summary" content="Stunning : A Science Fiction Masterpiece"></head><body><p>"Aeon Flux" is one of those rare films that gets universally negative reviews from critics who are normally used to 'epics' such as "Out of Africa" or "Terms of Endearment". It takes a different sort of mind to appreciate science fiction, because the genre is rare at giving us true classics. That said, if you liked David Lynchs' dark and disturbing film version of "Dune", then you will certainly find much to like in "Aeon Flux".<br /><br />The film runs like the fractured tale of a universe in peril, and one woman seems to hold the key and the balance between two insane realities. Charlize Theron really brings it as the lead character, and they really prop her well with the choicest special effects and the most liberal use of CGI, though in an appropriate manner. Theron has always been a good actress, but her stiff, warrior-like role here will win over the most jaded of science fiction fans, simply because there is no comparison (Milla Jovovich in "Ultraviolet" comes close, but that was more pop-art than dystopian art).<br /><br />The storyline is bleak, yet hopeful, and the multiple realities really make the film work even in areas where the script might sometimes let it down. There are issues with it, yes, but I think that it only works in making the film truly a work of art, because unlike other films in the genre, it doesn't cheapen science fiction, but rather glorifies it as a true vision of the future, much like the classic SF novels of the 1960s (remember Roger Zelazny?)<br /><br />"Aeon Flux" deserves five stars, and a really good projection system, because the visuals in this movie are just so clear, stunning and memorable, and this is one movie you can watch again and again - which in my book is the hallmark of a true classic.</p></body></html>

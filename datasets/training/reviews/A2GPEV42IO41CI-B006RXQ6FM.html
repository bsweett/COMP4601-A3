<meta name="summary" content="Stereotypical characters and a weak plot"></head><body><p>The story opens in 1964 in a neighborhood parish in the Bronx, where Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) is the school principal.  She's tough and traditional and bristles at the friendlier, more outgoing attitude of the pastor, Father Flynn (Phillip Seymour Hoffman).  A young teacher tells her that the priest may have acted inappropriately with one of her students, and Sister makes it her business to rid the parish of the dangerous man.<br /><br />This movie didn't live up to its hype for me.  I found the script dull and the actors competent, but not memorable.  The plot also draws upon the priest scandals of recent years and assumes guilt even though there is no evidence or trial.  There is no action at all and the overblown,  trite speeches lack real conviction.  I never believed Streep as the principal despite her scowls and knitted brows (and her accent that comes and goes); it all felt like play-acting.  Amy Adams is  way too saccharine and childlike as the young teacher.  I did like Hoffman as Father Flynn, however, and thought he did a good job of keeping us guessing.<br /><br />All in all, it seemed too stagy and tedious and ultimately pointless.  There were many things the Sister could and should have done with her suspicions but she did nothing except believe she was right.  It all  felt very unsatisfying to me.</p></body></html>

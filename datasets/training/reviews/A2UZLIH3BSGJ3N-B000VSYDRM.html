<meta name="summary" content=""I've the best nose in all of France""></head><body><p>"Perfume" describes a boy in 1800's France left for dead. At odds in the world, he acquires an unusual gift, the gift of smell, and not just any gift...one of extraordinary and unique talent. Unable or unwilling to speak, Jean-Louis Baptist prefers to use his sense of smell to define his environment, to define the world as he knows and understands it. To him words are too primitive and restricting to communicate what he sees, hears, or wants to say.<br />  Sold twice over, what seems like a dismal existence to work in a tannery he one day discovers a smell so profound, so intoxicating and so beautiful he is forever changed and is obsessed with obtaining its essence. He finds himself in an apprenticeship as a perfumist where he learns the art and skill of obtaining the essence of smell, but it still is not enough. That unique smell that he discovered from a woman has him so self obsessed; he stops at nothing to obtain it. Through trial and error he constantly experiments to find a way until one day he does with a prostitute.<br />From there he goes on a killing spree, as a 19th. Century serial murder in order to obtain the essence of smell from the most beautiful and purest of women to create the most perfect perfume the world has ever known. At long last he is caught and stands to be executed upon the eve that he will unveil his creation. A perfume extracted from 12 young women that is so perfect, so intoxicating, he can bend the will of mankind with it. He is found to be not guilty and deemed, "an Angel" and released. In the end he chooses his own fate and demise, and the secret of his perfect perfume dies with him.<br /> I found this film to be extremely well done. Excellently written and adapted from the novel, a great cast (both Allan Rickman and Dustin Hoffman are great to see onscreen). I thoroughly enjoyed the film from start to nearly the end. I found the end to be a slight let down, and a bit of a "cop out".<br /> I didn't care much for the town orgy scene. I know that both the novelist and the director were trying to create a scene that was very poetic/artsy, even surreal, but it didn't really do it for me. Perhaps I would need to see it again to see if there is something I missed? The end, well...I was a little disappointed with the end also. Far too easy of an ending, as if the novelist or director got "lazy" and "just wanted to finish". Still, it was a great story, I really did enjoy it. Even the narration through about half the film, it tied things together and you were able to see things from Jean Baptist's perspective. Well worth watching, I highly recommend it and you will not be disappointed. See it yourself to believe it.</p></body></html>

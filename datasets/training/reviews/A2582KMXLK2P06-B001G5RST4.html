<meta name="summary" content="amazingly good"></head><body><p>While probably a kids movie, the fun factor can be enjoyed from both kids and parents alike.  Each of the animated animals in the film had a distinct feel, and NONE of them were annoying, which is a big plus in animation because it seems like everybody wants to throw in at least one annoying character these days.  Not so in Madagascar.<br /><br />The penguins were absolutely hysterical.  The quality of the storyline is pretty good too, and the humor never fails.  Of course, as an adult, you have to kind of force yourself to pay attention to animated films for the entire length, but I was able to keep myself entertained, and I hope you are too.</p></body></html>

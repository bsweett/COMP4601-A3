All your deeds lay bare, all your sins punished? --- Davy Jones"></head><body><p>Although not as dark as it sounds, Dead Man's Chest delivers the goods and hints at many more adventures to come. I don't know if the Pirates writing crew is making this up as they go along or if they have a vision, but this film certainly hinted at a much broader vision of things to come with numerous references to past battles, loves lost, and hearts kept under lock and key.  It is a much more encompassing movie than was The Curse of the Black Pearl, but it is much more loose in structure.  Verbinski keeps the action going despite what is a pretty complicated set of stories, more or less interwoven together but ultimately left unresolved.  Johnny Depp may get top billing but it is Orlando Bloom who takes the lead in this movie, holding his own against sea-monsters and the King's men alike.  With nothing more to go on than the image of a key, Will Turner and Captain Jack Sparrow are reunited (sort of) in an attempt to unlock a chest that offers a strange treasure indeed.  Keira Knightley is reduced to a stowaway, with some memorable scenes, but not as big a role as she had in The Black Pearl.  Bill Nighy steals the show as the incredible Davy Jones, a half man/half sea monster that draws on Captain Nemo more than the Flying Dutchman, but develops a troubled dark soul all his own.  Naomie Harris makes for a fetching Voodoo Queen who ultimately unlocks the secret of this adventure, aiding Captain Jack and crew on their dark voyage.  Jack Davenport returns as Norrington, a much more compelling character this time around than he was in The Black Pearl.  Having fallen from grace, he completes the triangle that makes for some pretty tense action, especially in the closing scenes.<br /><br />Be warned that Dead Man's Chest is an open ended movie, setting up what promises to be a thrilling third installment to Pirates of the Caribbean.  Not only that, it hints at possible prequels because it covers so much territory in this sprawling movie that it leaves you craving for much more.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="3 disc Director's cut"></head><body><p>I watched this movie again and maybe I'm wrong but I didn't notice any difference in the feature itself compared to the feature in the 2 disc "special edition". I thought it was supposed to have "never before seen extended,unrated version of the film". If it's unrated why does the blue screen come on prior to the movie that says PG-13???<br /><br />True the directors cut is loaded w/ more extras due, however I did notice that the "from the den" thing was gone from this set(see the special ed.). I compared the two in the store and that's the only thing I noticed was missing. I did like the slim DVD cases included in this set. It's also supposed to be "remastered in high def" and I'll say it does look great on DVD.<br /><br />I wish they would've released a 3 disc director's cut on Superbit instead, maybe that's coming?</p></body></html>

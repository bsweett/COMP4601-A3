<meta name="summary" content="American dream or American nightmare?"></head><body><p>&quot;House of Sand and Fog,&quot; directed by Vadim Perelman, is based on a novel by Andre Dubus III.  The film stars Ben Kingsley as Col. Behrani, a former Iranian military officer under the Shah who now lives with his family in the United States.  He buys a house from a government source, not knowing that the property was improperly seized from its prior owner (Jennifer Connelly).  This bureaucratic nightmare sets up a personal conflict that drives the film.<p>&quot;House&quot; is a beautifully crafted film, rich in detail and visual impact.  But what really makes it shine are the excellent performances.  Connelly makes her wounded character's pain palpable.  As the colonel's wife, Shohreh Aghdashloo brings out both the inner lamb and lioness of the character.  Frances Fisher brings a steely authority to her small but memorable role as an attorney.  But it's Ben Kingsley who most impressed me.  He gives a rich, multifaceted, full-bodied performance; he explores his character's aspects as husband, father, warrior, businessman, and immigrant in a way that creates a memorable and believable person.<p>I found some plot points to seem a bit forced and hard to believe, but overall the superb craftsmanship of the film and its amazing performances really carry &quot;House.&quot;  This is a drama with moments of shocking intensity, as well as scenes of fierce anger and searing pain.  But there are also scenes of real compassion and tenderness.  It's a powerful story and a compelling use of the motif of the immigrant experience in America.</p></body></html>

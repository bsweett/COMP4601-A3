This is a film that delivers great comedy.<br /><br />Will Ferrell is excellent as Ricky Bobby, a man who, by a twist of fate, ends up becoming a NASCAR superstar.  The script Ferrell is given is perfect for him, allowing this comedic genius to work his on screen magic from beginning to end.  This is one of Ferrell's best movies.<br /><br />NASCAR fans will appreciate the detail and race excitement throughout this film.  The racing scenes are fantastic, vivid, and as real as it gets.  I've been to over 100 stock car racing event over the past thirty years, and I appreciated the realistic look to all of the racing scenes in this film.<br /><br />Gary Cole is perfect in his role.  I can't imagine anyone else playing the role of Ricky Bobby's father.  His "hillbillyish" charm and ignorance was funny, interesting, and addictive throughout the film.  His character is not far off from hundreds of thousands of men who follow the same philosophy on life.  "If you ain't first, you're last!"<br /><br />Leslie Bibb is extremely convincing and hilarious in her role as Carley Bobby, Ricky Bobby's wife.<br /><br />In fact, almost every role in this movie is perfectly cast.<br /><br />Comedies are supposed to be funny, in case some critics have forgotten this fact, and Talladega Nights delivers plenty of laughs, along with a very interesting storyline, some great action, and a cast that is committed to making this film a success.<br /><br />I was not happy with some of the profanity or the gay humor throughout this film, but for the most part, it was a family friendly film that delivers plenty of laughs and lots of fun.<br /><br />I say this Talladega Nights is a DVD worth owning.  And if I say it, you can be sure it is a worthy purchase.<br /><br />So ignore the negative reviews and purchase this excellent comedy.  That way, you'll know what to do with your hands during an important interview.<br /><br />See ya next review.</p></body></html>

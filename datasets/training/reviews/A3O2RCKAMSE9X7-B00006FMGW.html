CATCH ME IF YOU CAN brings to mind Tony Curtis as Ferdinand Waldo Demarra of THE GREAT IMPOSTER.  However, in Curtis' case, his quest for identity was vaguely undefined as he sloughed his skins more for the sheer joy of it than for any other ostensible purpose.  Leonardo DiCaprio made it clear early on that his own quest was based on a need to restore his moral universe, one in which was threatened by the dissolution of his parents' marriage.  DiCaprio, as Frank Abagnale,Jr, idolized his parents.  When they danced, the joy in his eyes was unmistakable.  It was when they stopped dancing, that the world of marital discord intruded.  Christopher Walken, as Frank's con man father, gives a powerful performance as a smooth talking yet ineffective businessman whose only success in life was to have married a desirable Frenchwoman some twenty years earlier.  It is Walken's constant harping of his landing her that, over the years, became the central mantra for his son's life.  In the young Frank's eyes, his mother became a symbol of all that was noble and beautiful, and if it were a lack of money and success that doomed his father to lose her, then it became his own mission in life to reconnect them.  All of the scams that Frank Jr. pulled off are seen not as to enrich his own wallet, but to act as the glue to reestablish the natural order of things.  DiCaprio's most touching scenes are the most easily overlooked. In a restaurant, he is dressed as a co-pilot, treating his father to a fancy meal.  During the conversation, in front of his father's astonished eyes, he casually pushes the keys to a brand new Cadillac parked just outside.  "Take them, Dad," he pleads, "won't Mom be impressed."  There are many scenes like that which allow Frank to make it clear that his crimes of theft and forgery mask a talent that under different circumstances might have allowed him to be in  the flesh those fake uniformed superficial entities that now register in the mind as the prototypical demi-gods that ruled the television screens of the 60s.  <p>Tom Hanks, as FBI agent Carl Hanratty, registers as a sort of combination of pseudo-father figure whose respect Frank wishes with a more than subtle undertone as Frank's Dr. Richard Kimble to Carl's Detective Gerard.  But unlike that fugitive, this one plays his escapes with style and a sense of not wishing to blend in.  Where Dr. Kimble sought work as dishwashers, Frank Abagnale flew only in the highest stratospheres of our cultures.  Not only did he want the job of pilot, doctor, and lawyer, he wanted their badge and uniform too. This connection of Carl Hanratty as father-confessor and father-surrogate slowly accrues its own kinetic energy until by the film's end, the bond between Frank and Carl was at least as strong as the one that Frank tried so hard to forge with his own father.  By the time the closing credits roll, Frank shows that the simple respect that one human being can feel for another can be enough to turn around a life that for a few short years seemed headed for a tragedy that this film thankfully avoided.  CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is one of the most entertaining films of the year that in its own way points out the need for people to connect in a manner not unlike that Jimmy Stewart posited in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.</p></body></html>

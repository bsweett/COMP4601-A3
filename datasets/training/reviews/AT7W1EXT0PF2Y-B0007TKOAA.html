Thus I subjected myself to this nightmare. Church played lovable but borderline psychotic moron Lowell, in Wings. He played not-so-lovable and borderline psychotic businessman Ned in Ned n Stacey. So what could I watch and not like him in? Answer: Sideways. Church plays a not-so-lovable psychotic womanizer whose idea of a good time is going out to cheat on his wife as much as possible before their wedding. If there could be a better example of human filth it would be his friend and co-star Miles. Miles is a whiny, spineless, sack of worthless human being. His goal in this movie is to get laid period. Yes, what a wonderful and totally brand-new plot we've been given. So while they are on this mission, they drive through California orchards and drink a lot of wine.<br /><br />Keep in mind how the words whine and wine are homophones. Either one of these two things come out of Miles' mouth whenever he speaks. He's either talking about wine or whining about something or other. What kind of grown man is this fixated on wine? Yes, I like wine, I like to drink it. I don't like to memorize every frikkin kind there is, what years are best, etc. I don't like to stand around sniffing wine, like a cocker spaniel sniffs its urine, I have better things to do.<br /><br />In this ridiculous work of the author's imagination, the wimpy, spineless man gets the girl in the end. There is no character development. He doesn't realize that he's a pathetic fool, improve himself and ultimately win the girl. He stays a disgusting pitiful wretch of a human being and that's fine with her. If I haven't given you enough reasons not to watch this film, by all means read on cause here's the coup de grace. We get to see a nude Thomas Haden Church copulating with a woman in the butterfly position. I DID NOT need to see this. I did not want the image of THC's buttocks forever tattooed on my psyche. Any faith and respect I ever had for THC is nuked to nothingness when he breaks down in the end like a whiny spineless Miles. Do yourself a favor kill yourself if you have to, but do not watch this movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Starship Troopers-For Patriots and Citizens Only"></head><body><p>Besides the fact that the title of my review has nothing whatsoever to do with my opinion of this film I thought Starship Troopers was an outstanding sci-fi movie which obviously and (I believe) intentionally oversimplifies the position it appears to take on the value of being a "true soldier".<br /><br />Nobody should read too much into the politics and just enjoy the great action, outstanding special effects and competent acting. I rate this movie at 5+ stars and hope to see the likes of it again. The scale and scope of the large screen CGI effects for huge fleets of starships looked absolutely authentic and would make any pacifist proud to witness the display of military power (at least for the duration of this film).<br /><br />I recent watched this film on my large screen HDTV for the first time. I was amazed by the color, clarity, sharpness, and good general definition. All of the great effects and action were transferred to DVD beautifully regardless of how staged (i.e., computer generated or live action). What a geat DVD transfer.  I can only imagine what this film would be like in Blue Ray.<br /><br />I really didn't know at the time I saw the movie anything about its origins and thought the political background was a simple construct assembled for the sake of the movie.  It was so simply stated that I trust most viewers didn't take it too seriously.  I don't know what the writers may have believed, but as far as the film was concerned it came on as a science fiction movie from start to finish.<br /><br />I also felt that the CGI images were enormously original on a scope which has been achieved only by a few sci-fi movies.  In addition, the basic design and computer effects for the warrior bugs were absolutely outstanding and for my money were only surpassed by Giger's vision for the Alion.</p></body></html>

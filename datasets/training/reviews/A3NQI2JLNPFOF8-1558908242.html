I'll never be part of something like that." -Natalie Portman<br /><br />The above quote is typical for people that don't like this movie.  They can never just not like it....they always have to start some crusade against it.  Oh, go away.  If you don't get it then watch something else.  If you don't like it than say so and move on.  I, personally despised the movie, Van Helsing.  I hated it with ever fiber of my being.  But I'll leave it at that.  I won't talk about how it signifies 'the downfall of moral society'.  Let's move on.<br /><br />If you've never seen this then you most likely have heard alot about it.  You know it re-launched Travolta's career.  You know it contains a mysterious suitcase.  And you might even know that the story consists of 'chapters' that jump around out of sequence.  What you might not know is that the each and every scene is a little movie in of itself.  A little masterpiece.  The car ride in the beginning, the walk to the apartment door, the conversation with Brett, any scene where there are people sitting down eating, Marcellus Wallace's talk with Butch, Christopher Walken's talk with Butch, the cab ride with Esmerelda, and so on, and so on.  The movie's full of them, and each one of these scenes is it's own little masterpiece that can exist outside the movie.  They are, in fact, their own short films inside a bigger film.  And THAT'S why this movie is so great.  That's what keeps people so entranced at the stroytelling.<br /><br />During a New York premier of Pulp Fiction, a woman went into cardiac arrest after the 'adrenaline injection' scene.  The woman recovered and was fine but in an interview when Tarentino was asked to comment on the incident....he said, "Whoa....keeping an audience interested is one thing.....but stopping someone's heart?  That's good f****ng movie-making!"</p></body></html>

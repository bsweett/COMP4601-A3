<meta name="summary" content="An Immortal Evil Mummy.  An Aged Elvis With An Aged JFK.  No Holds Barred."></head><body><p>A nursing home resident who believes he's Elvis (played by Bruce Campbell) must convince another resident (played by Ossie Davis) who believes he's JFK (Lyndon B. Johnson apparantly had the CIA dye him black so no one would recognize him) to team up and battle a lifeforce-sucking mummy Elvis believes is haunting the resting home.  Take That, all you who say there are no original ideas left for movies!<br /><br />  How does one go about elaborating on this further?  First of all, although it has a lot of horror movie elements, it's not really a horror movie itself, although it shares enough of a border with the horror field to be of appeal to horror fans at large, such as myself.  It's a comedy a lot of the time, but not in a stupid or 'spoofish' way; its humor is genuine and not merely parodying something else so it doesn't have to stand on its own feet.  And it's surprisingly moving and uplifting - in ways I'll go into more in a moment - but can one really class a movie centering on the battle between a man who may or may not be Elvis Presley against a life-draining immortal mummy who goes by the unlikely moniker of Bubba-Ho-Tep as a drama?<br /><br />  Here's where its inspirational and moving nature comes in: "Elvis" (he believes he's the real deal who switched places with an impersonator to get out of the limelight and then was trapped in the role when the impersonator died; the nursing home staff believe he hit his head too hard when he fell off a stage one night) is living a life of emptiness and despair.  Basically abandoned to his own devices in the home (this movie makes some points about the distressingly 'disposable' nature omuch of society seems to have assigned the elderly, the infirm and the mentally trobled), he's deteriorated physically and emotionally into a weak (and rather coarse-mouthed) shell of himself, hit particularly hard by the death of his roomate (whose demise is the first thing in years to bring any of the roomate's family to the home), is only jostled out of his state when the mummy begins making his appearances.  Clandestinely investigating the strange goings-on, a strange thing happens to "Elvis" himself: he begins to live again.  To paraphrase from a deleted scence where "Elvis" is noticing his improved vigor, he figures out that (and I'm paraphrasing here) "for the first time in a long time, I wasn't thinking about my next meal or whether I was going to be able to make it to the bathroom to take a ****, I was actually doing something that interested me."  In trying to stave off death, both for themselves and the other residents, 'Elvis' and JFK' begin to remember how to live again.  And the friendship formed between this unlikely (and cranky) pair is true and touching.  In the end it's two old men who society had sort of written off as just ticking off the days until death (and by this point, it perhaps doesn't matter so much if they really are who they think they are or not) that stage a showdown against an ancient evil that's only feeding on the weak while it powers up to truly terrorize the world.<br /><br />  For anyone who gets thinking that life has passed them by, that they're too old for something or that their dreams are dead beyond retrieval, this is powerful and inspirational stuff, and it doesn't matter whether you're 91 or 16 or 57.  A lot of people are going to think that's awfully sappy, but it's true and it's a powerful message.  It's also worth noting that this is one of very few movies to make characters this age its protagonists.<br /><br />  Ossie Davis, who I don't believe I've ever seen in anything else, is simply brilliant here.  And Bruce Campbell, famous for his turns as Ash in the "Evil Dead" trilogy (particularly shining in "Evil Dead 2", my personal favorite of the series) astonishes with how dead-on he captures the role, with a perfect accent for the part, and wordless facial expression conveying mountains of emotion, often of long-suppressed emotion just now cracking the surface.  For fans of weird cinema, deep drama, horror and/or off-the-beaten-track comedy; "Bubba-Ho-Tep" is one of the unlikliest greats I've seen.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Milk"></head><body><p>`Milk' is the story of Harvey Milk who was the first openly gay man elected to political office in America. Set in the seventies this film explores gay rights issues in San Francisco and America in general and the opposition Milk experienced to his candidacy and the issues he fought for. With a great cast and another amazing performance from Sean Penn, this film quickly draws you in and keeps you watching until the shattering conclusion. Penn's acting seems to get better with each film he makes and from once being the bad boy of Hollywood he is now a credible and highly respected actor/director and rightly so in my opinion. This also has note worthy performances from Emile Hirsh and Josh Brolin. Milk's development from Haight area hippy to vocal activist and politician is shown excellently and makes for fascinating viewing even if you aren't interested in politics or gay rights issues. For a powerful storyline, that is all the more potent for being true, this film is well worth considering. It is well acted, well directed and has a crushing conclusion that you will leave you speechless and affected.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

I mean, there are so many points in this movie where you have to wonder if they lost pages in the script, or if the writers have actually experienced the mildest winter at all. But then again, I think it's safe to say that any movie that comes out between May and August is meant strictly for entertainment. And in that way, this movie works. It's a story about global warming. You see, the pollution our Earth is subjected to is creating a greenhouse effect, melting the polar ice caps, which in turns floods the closest land -- of which New York seems to be the primary victim, with Canada being wiped out completely (?) -- where the water level reaches unimaginable heights, and, (in)conveiniently freezes, creating a new ice age. The movie centers around a father and son who are in totally different places at the time of disaster. The son (I forget names in this movie), played by "Spider-man" understudy Jake Gyllenhaal, is trapped in a New York City library with some of his friends and a crowd of lucky people who are waiting out the storm. His father, played by Dennis Quaid, the scientist who saw it all coming, and thus, is filling in for Jeff Goldblum, heads to New York with two of his headstrong buddies to save his son. There are a few little subplots thrown in between, but they are so half-hearted and under-developed that they have no meaning. They could have easily trimmed 30 minutes off of this movie and received the same effect. The characters are downright dumb, with a hobo and his dog being the intellectual standouts. But then again, we didn't come here to see good acting, did we? Nope. The special effects and the action sequences are where the money's at, and this movie makes good on it's promise. All of the special effects are accomplished well, even if they play out better on the big screen. This is definitely a good movie to show off your new system with. Even if there are some parts that are impossible to believe, such as when Quaid and Co. are travelling through the storm, they obviously can't see the road or where they're going, or anything for that matter, but don't crash (for a while anyways). In real life, they would have made it about 500 yards before landing in a ditch or getting stuck in the snow, or worse, taking a wrong turn into the woods. But anyways, it's still a fun movie, with some shades of political satire -- The President is dumb and useless (and dies very easily), while the Vice President is still dumb, but obviously the man in charge. One of the few minor plots that actually works. Overall, it's an entertaining little romp, if you just detach your brain. If you liked "Independence Day," or God forbid, "Godzilla" (I actually did), this one will be right up your alley. Just don't take it too seriously.</p></body></html>

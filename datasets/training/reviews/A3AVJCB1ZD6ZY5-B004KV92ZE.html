<meta name="summary" content="From noodle shop waiter to kung fu master"></head><body><p>By day, Po the Panda (voiced by Jack Black) struggles as a waiter in his father's noodle shop.  But he dreams of being a kung fu warrior.<br /><br />When he learns the Dragon Warrior is finally going to be named, he rushes to the temple and by accident ends up at the end of the Ooway the Ancient Turtle's (voice by Randall Duk Kim) pointing finger when he makes the proclamation. Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) and his five fighting pupils are all dismayed at the choice, but Ooway advises them there are no accidents.<br /><br />Finally, when the snow leopard Tai Ling (Ian McShane) breaks out of jail and comes to wreak his vengeance on teh valley, Shifu agrees to help Po learn to fight.  All he needs is to believe in himself and work hard...<br /><br />Dreamworks has done a great job with the CGI for this film. The animation is smooth and the characters really do seem real.  The Chinese countryside is beautiful as well.<br /><br />Clearly, from the video games and plush toys you can find on Amazon, this movie may well be a contender for largest sales of related products.  The movie itself is entertaining for kids of all ages.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, June 2008</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Funny & Genuine, this Quirky Family Dramedy Rises Above the Cliches."></head><body><p>I am hard on movies about quirky characters and their obligatory "dysfunctional" families. I've seen too many that are nothing more than chains of tired cliches strung end to end. But "Little Miss Sunshine"'s vibrant, genuine characters stand out among quirky indie relationship films. Richard Hoover (Greg Kinnear) is a frustrated motivational speaker with high hopes for a book deal. When his 7-year old daughter Olive (Abigail Breslin) is accepted in the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant, the family wants to make sure she has the opportunity to pursue her beauty pageant dreams. But wife Sheryl (Toni Colette) can't drive a stick shift. Uncle Frank (Steve Carrell) can't be left alone. Grandpa (Alan Arkin) is Olive's talent coach. And silent teenaged brother Dwayne (Paul Dano) is just put upon. So they all pile into the family's yellow VW minibus to drive Olive 700 miles to California.<br /><br />Owing to Michael Arndt's heartfelt script and its wonderful ensemble cast, "Little Miss Sunshine" is both hilarious and credible on an emotional level. The characters are active and deliberate, never reactive, and never played for laughs. The interplay of several generations of characters without demeaning or marginalizing any of them always does wonders for relationship dramas. The middle-aged parents, delinquent grandpa, optimistic child, and morose teen are all fully-realized, equally interesting people. "Little Miss Sunshine" never feels contrived even though it could hardly be moreso. The characters don't feel like cliches, even though I've seen them before. The family actually functions very well. In the end, I couldn't help liking all of these people and laughing with them all the way to California.<br /><br />The DVD (20th Century Fox 2006): This is a 2-sided disc with a full screen version on Side A and widescreen on Side B. There are 2 audio commentaries, both of which can be found on either side of the disc. The first audio commentary is by husband and wife directing team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris. They discuss the film's tone, casting, filming in the van, the actors, the sets, and  more. The second commentary is by screenwriter Michael Arndt and directors Dayton and Faris. There is more about characters and dialogue in this commentary. But there is a lot of repetition between the commentaries, so if you want to listen to one, I recommend the writer/directors commentary. Also on Side A, there is a music video of "Till the End of Time" by Devotchka and a Soundtrack Spot. On Side B are 4 alternate endings (5 min) with optional directors' commentary. Subtitles are available for the film in English, Spanish, and French.</p></body></html>

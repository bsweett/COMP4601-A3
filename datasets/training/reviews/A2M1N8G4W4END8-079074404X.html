<meta name="summary" content="A Classic from the Golden Age of SF Cinema!"></head><body><p>A liberal interpretation of William Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST, with a wee bit of Freudian psychology thrown into the mix, the 1956 science-fiction classic FORBIDDEN PLANET follows the crew of a United Planets Cruiser on a mission to the distant planet Altair IV, home to a once-thriving scientific colony that has been mysteriously incommunicado for some time.  <p>When the cruiser reaches Altair IV, Commander John J. Adams (Leslie Nielsen) and his crew make radio contact with a Dr. Edward Morbius (Walter Pidgeon), one of the hitherto &quot;missing&quot; colonists.  However, Morbius warns Adams to turn back, insisting that the crew will be in mortal danger if they touch down on the planet's surface. Adams orders his crew to land the ship anyway, of course, and they find that all the members of colony have perished save for three--Dr. Morbius, his curvaceous daughter Altaira (Anne Francis), and an intellectual robotic wunderkind named Robby.<p>Not satisfied with Morbius' explanation about what happened to the other colonists, Adams and his crew seek evidence that will either corroborate or discredit Morbius' story.  What they find is the remnants of the advanced alien race that inhabited the Altair IV aeons ago.  Could this hold the key that unlocks the mystery of the missing colonists?<p>Even after nearly half a century, FORBIDDEN PLANET remains both an interesting and thought-provoking film.  Not only does it offer a clever space-age interpretation of Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST, the special FX are still eye-poppingly cool, even when faced off against the CGI FX of contemporary fare.  One of the best special FX in the film is, of course, Robby the Robot.  A very expensive prop for MGM to build, Robby stands at a height of 7-and-a-half feet and weighs about 300 pounds.  He has become one of the most popular robots in the history of films and television, and as such, he has made cameo appearances in such movies as 1984's GREMLINS and 2003's LOONEY TUNES: BACK IN ACTION and on television shows like THE TWILIGHT ZONE and LOST IN SPACE.<p>In addition to Robby, the three principal human actors in FORBIDDEN PLANET also contribute to the film's success.  Leslie Nielsen is well known to film buffs as the comic star of such films as THE NAKED GUN: FROM THE FILES OF POLICE SQUAD (1988) and SPY HARD (1996).  But here he does an excellent job in a serious role as John J. Adams, the commander of the spaceship, and for modern audiences, then, there is this added treat of seeing Nielson play one of the stodgy establishment types that he is now famous for parodying.  The deep-voiced Walter Pidgeon is a masterful old-school thespian who is also a delight to watch.  Here he makes his Dr. Morbius a devilishly pompous and pendantic patriarch, and the histrionics with which he does so are perfectly suited to the character.  And finally, there's the lovely Anne Francis playing Dr. Morbius' daughter, Altaira.  While Ms. Francis does not have the same range or depth as Nielsen or Pidgeon, she takes a role that was meant to be eye-candy and makes it more than a mere cardboard cut-out.<p>So the storytelling, the FX, and the acting all combine to make FORBIDDEN PLANET a compelling film that entertains but also makes you think.  And to genre fans, that is science fiction at its best.<p>The MGM DVD is short on extras, basically offering only the theatrical trailer.  But the disc does offer the film in an anamorphic widescreen format at the film's original aspect ratio of 2.35:1, and it appears that the digital transfer was made from a copy of the print that was in excellent shape for a film so old!  For SF fans who want to add this piece of classic American cinema to their collections, the reasonable amazon.com price makes it easy!</p></body></html>

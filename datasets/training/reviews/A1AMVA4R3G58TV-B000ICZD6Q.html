<meta name="summary" content="Modern Story"></head><body><p>Dennis Quaid and Topher Grace are perfectly paired as the employee/boss in this interesting true to life drama and comedy. Watching the film, I was amazed to think just how realistic this plot is. Older employees get demoted all the time in order to bring in a newer younger genertion. The way the corporate structure is portrayed in the film it comes across very realistic.Scarlet Johansen is amazing as the daughter who falls for her dads new boss.<br /><br />The script is very well-done and tells the story of the modern business world - while portraying a meaningful family story.</p></body></html>

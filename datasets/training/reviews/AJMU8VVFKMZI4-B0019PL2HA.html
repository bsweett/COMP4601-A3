Other than their names, I found their foul mouths a turn off.  I really don't have to go far to find rude kids in real life, so I can do without them in my "entertainment".  Sacha Cohen was also funny and John C. Reilly is in everything, isn't he?  During the rehilbilating period, it was quite funny him thinking he was poor and had to deliver pizza for a living.  Overall, Talladega Nights was a strong script and most of the humor was dead-on funny.  Recommended.</p></body></html>

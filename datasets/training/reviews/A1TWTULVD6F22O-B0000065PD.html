<meta name="summary" content="Visually exciting..."></head><body><p>with a creative science fiction story behind it, Stargate is definitely worth a viewing.  Emmerich couples outstanding visual effects with tremendous audio and some interesting special features on the DVD.<p>In the cast, both Spader and Jaye Davidson contribute strong performances.  Spader is the everyman who is a specialist in some sort of obscure intelligentsia who gets confronted with action and involved with people when his science comes alive.  He makes the right choices and has both the audience and the rest of the cast rooting for him as he stumbles into his eventual success.  An interesting actor who can play a naive hero or a driven villain, Spader leads the way in this film.  Jaye Davidson is chilling as the villain.  Without words, his presence on screen can make you feel his lack of remorse and his willingness to do away with everything that comes between him and his final destiny.<p>Soldiers in the cast include the oft-cast Russell as the commander of the mission, in, what is typical for him, a &quot;strong jaw&quot; role.<p>Critics have challenged this movie as absurd and cliche, but after all, what is science fiction trying to accomplish?  Stargate had success at the box office and on video precisely because of its entertainment value and the visual excitement generated by combining technology with a society that rivals the ancient Egyptians.  Although you may rent instead of buy, you will enjoy this entertaining film, and may return to it again and again because it draws you in and keeps you entertained until the very last (and yes, it is a heart-warming finale!)<p>Try it, you'll like it!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Rat in the Kitchen"></head><body><p>This is the best movie Pixar has done since Toy Story, not only taking computer animation to the next level, but returning to the fun story telling that propelled Toy Story.  I hope that Pixar includes a couple shorts with the movie, like the amusing "Lifted," which served as a prelude to the movie in the theatres.  I think the creators owe a big debt to The Triplets of Belleville and French animation in general for the visages of their many characters.  The restaurant critic was great, captured to sublime perfection, right down to the change of expression on his face when he sampled the Ratatouille.  A voice only Peter O'Toole could do. Janeane Garofalo was great as Colette as well.  But it was Remy who stole the show, a rat with a great nose for food, guided in his search for the ultimate cuisine by the ghost of the consumate chef, Gusteau.  Remy gave the young Linguini (Lou Romano) a decided advantage, while the hilarious Skinner (Ian Holm) smelled a rat in his kitchen.  Lou Romano seems to have found a home with Pixar.  The movie is great fun for everyone!</p></body></html>

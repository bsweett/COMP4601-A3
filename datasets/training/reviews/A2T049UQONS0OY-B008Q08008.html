There is little in my existence that presents a more shattering, emotional and involving real life story than this astounding film.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it (poor you!), it's a nearly three hour review of events that occurred in Poland from the time of the Nazis invasion and occupation in 1939, through the development of the Warsaw ghetto, to the trains hauling people away to concentration camps, to the resistance fighting to regain their country, to the Russians eventual arrival in 1945. In an afterthought, it appears everything ends well...although we all know Stalin and the USSR put Poland under its thumb in 1945.<br /><br />The film tells the real life story of a Polish pianist, a national treasure, that was hidden during the war. The first hour of the film is told through his family's travails; the rest through his life. His story is told in remarkable vignettes of battles in the streets of Poland with some of the best war footage ever created for the screen. It won exceptionally well-deserved Oscars for Adrien Brody and director Roman Polanski and the adapted screenplay from the book by its subject, Wladysalv Szpilman.<br /><br />The score to this film, available on a remakable Sony CD, is not only a generous offering of music from the film but one of the better Chopin collections of recent years, very well-played by extrovert pianist Janusz Olejnicak. It includes one of Szpilman's own Chopin pieces, circa 1948.<br /><br />My one complaint: Can someone explain to me how the little entertainment "Chicago" beat out this film for best film of 2002 as judged by the Motion Picutre Academy? What a travesty! Here is a once in a decade film and surely the best World War II story since "The English Patient" and better than that flick! Adrien Brody at least won the Oscar for best actor. Maybe he deserved that but this film surely deserved best movie. It is probably the best film of the new century.</p></body></html>

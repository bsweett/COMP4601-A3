<meta name="summary" content="Nothing Special..."></head><body><p>This movie is either hated or loved, I guess you as the viewer will have to take the pick. I myself thought it was nothing special from all the other King Arthur movies made. They tried I guess to make the movie different this time by hacking out a lot of the old story that has repeatedly been done on so many other movies and they thought this would make it better. Honestly it really didn't. It just made King Arthur fans like I disappointed and somewhat bitter. I can understand they wanted to make it a little different but it didn't seem right all the things they changed.<br />A lot of it seemed unreal and totally barren. Like Merlin, why is it you see him so little, when in the other Arthur films he is the main star? And Arthur hated him in this film, instead of considering him a true friend like in the other films? One of the largest reasons I liked the King Arthur story was because of Merlin. You do not see him though hardly ever in this film though so don't expect him to be. And Guniverye (I can never spell that name right) she was very unrealistic in this film for many reasons. I know they wanted a strong female image but back then women, especially half- starved women with a wounded hand did not fight alongside men. That was very unrealistic. Then the whole essence of passion in the love triangle of Lancelot and Arthur with G. was so vague in this film, when it was supposed to be one of the biggest problems in the whole story. They hacked a lot out of this story definitely, a lot of the stuff that made the story of King Arthur so popular in the first place. So yes, the movie loses major points on this. And the other thing is again, even with all those changes I may have enjoyed the movie nonetheless if the changes were interesting, which they weren't. They were changes that made once a fascinating, mystical legend just to me another historic movie with a few battle scenes, a few words of honor, and then the credits. And since I do enjoy historic movies, I thought this one was all right, it isn't terrible, but it was nothing worth watching again.<br />There has been better historic movies, and definitely better King Arthur films so I advise watching this movie once, and take your decision of it. Then watch an original story of King Arthur in film. Then you decide which is better. The modern tale, or the original tale. It probably will be a different opinion for everyone, but honestly I prefer the original.</p></body></html>

The art direction is astounding, and shows off a huge amount of technical mastery and creativity.  Jude Law is perfect as Sky Captain, and Gwyneth Paltrow pulls off the Polly Perkins role as well, which I hadn't expected given her background as a "serious" actress.  Giovanni Ribisi steals the show as Dex.<br /><br />So why just three stars?  Despite all the action, the great art and the quality of the performances, "Sky Captain" is generally listless and uninvolving.  "Indiana Jones" attempted something similar with a different kind of serial, and succeeded in part because of the sense of fun of the movie overall.  That sense of fun is generally missing from "Sky Captain."<br /><br />This is well worth viewing once, and you will probably enjoy it, but you might not be inclined to add this to your permanent collection.</p></body></html>

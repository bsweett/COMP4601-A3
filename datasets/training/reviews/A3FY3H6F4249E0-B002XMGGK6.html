<meta name="summary" content="A Mastermind at Murder"></head><body><p>Saw this by accident--sort of.  I was at my cousin's house in Crisfield, Maryland and she had rented it.  Once I started watching it, I had to find out who did what and how. Although not my kind of movie, I have to admit it was VERY good.  BUT, it is very bloody and includes torture, beheading, and sodomy.  It even flipped my stomach a bit.  If you can handle that shock stuff, read on.<br /><br />In the very beginning, Gerard Butler and his family are confronted by burgulars.  He is tied up and forced to watch his wife sodomized and murdered by this rotten $#@$^& "person".  After that, he carries the daughter away.  Fortunately, they didn't show the details but you do find out he killed her.  Although stabbed and left to die, Gerard lives and is hell-bent on revenge.  He is a master on strategizing.  Even while he is in jail, people are dying brutally, one at a time.  But, is it him?  How can he kill people on the outside?  Does he have an accomplice?<br /><br />Jamie Foxx is a DA and does an acceptible job in the movie but Gerald ain't no dummy.<br /><br />The strategizing is really good and Gerard does one heck of a job in his role.(Nice Bod, too.)<br /><br />BUT--this is a brutal movie.  God only knows what the "uncut" version has that the one I watched didn't have, but I won't be finding out.  Please, do NOT let your children watch it.  If you buy it for yourself, watch it when they are not home and then lock it away somewhere.</p></body></html>

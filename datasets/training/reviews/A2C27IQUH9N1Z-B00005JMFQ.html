<meta name="summary" content="crowded but charming film about love in its many guises"></head><body><p>Director Richard Curtis has a charming vision of love surrounding us and affecting everyone's lives in a multitude of ways.  He also has a terrific all-star cast.  What he does not have is a script worthy of either the vision or the cast.  While the film is enjoyable in a breezy way, several of the many story lines are superfluous or gratuitous, and often situations and lines are much too predictable.  Hugh Grant is, of course, charming in his blinky way, and Emma Thompson is terrific, but the most consistently good scenes go to Bill Nighy, who shines as a comeback rocker, charming Brits with his profane comeback attempt.  Grant, Thompson and Nighy rise above a trite script, but others don't fare so well.  This is not an evil film.  I don't resent the time I spent watching it.  But it is a shame to have such a nice idea and such a talented cast wasted over this cliched script.<p>The dvd extra features are good, and include a commentary track with director Curtis and stars Nighy, Grant and Sangster; 37 minutes of deleted scenes; 8 minutes of music; and a Kelly Clarkson video,  The film can be heard or subtitled in English, French or Spanish.<p>Chances are, if you like these stars or this premise, you will enjoy the film, but it's not as good as one would hope.</p></body></html>

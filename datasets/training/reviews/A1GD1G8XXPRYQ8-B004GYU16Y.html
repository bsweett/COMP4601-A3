A guy comes to CIA and tells that the country dies and the president will die, and all other upcoming nonsense. I was like...okay how much director payed to him to say all that? And why would Russian man would want to kill some Russian president? I thought I'd finish eating and go watch another movie.'' But I gave it a try and I'm glad I did. It had some twists and I liked the action parts especially on Angelina's behalf. The whole movie was pretty cool. Watch it for yourself. I recommend it.</p></body></html>

Excellently captures Harlem's 1970s setting.<br />*Good story that encompasses Frank Lucas' entire career. Lots of interesting ideas concerning his approach to his business. Also good focus on his enemy (whoever Russel Crowe played, I forget his name). It was very interesting to see them cooperate at the end.<br />*Good, somewhat fascinating portrayal of the main characters.<br />*Plenty of drama.<br />*Some action and violence.<br />*Some memorable scenes and imagery.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*A little long.<br /><br />Compared to other gangster films, this one seems no better and no worse. It has lots of good imagery and interesting scenes. Ridley Scott's direction is excellent, as always. There is a lot of drama, and it looks like they went into a lot of trouble to make the film as realistic as possible to the characters, events, and settings. Still, it doesn't seem as thrilling or deep as the established classics. If you're into these kinds of films, then by all means watch it. Otherwise, rent it first and see what you think.<br /><br />The DVDs contain a massive shed-load of special features on the first two discs.  Disc one includes both the theatrical and extended cuts.  The third disc in this collector's set has only another hour's worth of features, and the digital copy of the film.</p></body></html>

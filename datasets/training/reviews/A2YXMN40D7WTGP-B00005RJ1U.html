<meta name="summary" content="Stands apart from long drought in Horror genre"></head><body><p>I personally believe the Horror movie industry began a slow decline in the mid 1980's. It seemed like every possibility had been used up and audiences could not longer be spooked with gory special effects or imaginative use of the cinema camera. Auteurs like Dario Argento, Mario Bava, George Romero and even hacks like Lucio Fulci began to get progressively worse as the 1980's wore on. At this time, American horror movies began the development of "character" driven horror movies (since the good guys where all victims, only the baddies could get character development) and this led to serial series including horror stalwarts such as Freddie Krueger, Michael Myers, Jason Voohees as well as lesser knowns like the Tall Man (Phantasm). These serial horror movies (Jason X, Freddie VII, Halloween H20, Puppet Master 15) led to the downfall, because while the series runs out of ideas after the second movie, the movies are continued to be made.<br /><br />The 1990's brought some interesting ideas. I liked movies like People Under the Stairs (1991), Scream (1996) and others, but the genre has not recovered. In the early 1980's, Jeepers Creepers would not be considered much of an atmospheric movie (compared to movies like "The Fog" or "The keep"), but in a genre in which movies like Jason X and The Haunting exist, Jeeper's Creepers does pretty well.<br /><br />The movie starts with a brother and sister pair going home for Spring Break. Darry (short for Darius) is the younger brother, who is a goof and easy going. Trish is the older, more cynical sister. As they drive, they play silly road games (like we all used to during long road trips) and pick on each other, however, there is always an air of tension in the air that lingers even in the most lightest moments. It is helped by the fact that the soundtrack is very much in the background, not manipulating the audience.<br /><br />Terror does appear in the form of an old battered truck that terrorizes the teens. It is an homage to Duel, one of my favorite movies of the 1970's. However, soon we find out the identity of the driver as the kids pass by and see him dropping body bags into a sewer. In a scene that defies all logic, but falls under the "rules" that govern horror movies, the two go back and investigate what is happening. What they find is horrifying, but not too original (Salva and his production designer must have seen one Coffin Joe movie too much).<br /><br />The being catches their scent and begins tracking them down and the movies turns into a cat and mouse game, with the protagonists frantically running and the antagonist turning into the indistructible shape. While the movie begins to term generic and the baddies turns into another Freddie like character, the ending was great and does provide a slight twist.<br /><br />Victor Salva, who was notorious as being the "child molester" director has directed two movies that I have seen. Clownhouse is a low budget movie that was fairly well done, but his first big budget movie "Powder" was simply horrible. With Jeepers Creepers he starts out well, but as the story develops, the audience learns too much of the creature and it begins to lose it's mystique (One of the reason why the movie Duel was so great was because we never understand the motives of the crazy trucker). At the end we find out he's just another movie monster, another demon that has no appeal because the only thing that makes it interesting is taken away from it.<br /><br />The brother and sister duo do better. They are believable as siblings and do what they can with the simplistic script. However, they are not given a chance to progress their relationship past the setup phase so when one of the siblings are taken away from the other, we don't feel the great sense of loss that we should.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is good in a genre that has consistently given us crap over the past 15 years. But, this movie is in no way going to be a classic.....Rating: C+<br /><br />The DVD has several featuers, but it is not full of them. The minimalistic soundtrack gets creepy at the right momemts and has decent (but not great) dynamic punch. The transfer is average...DVD features rating is C.</p></body></html>

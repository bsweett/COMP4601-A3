There is nothing cute or cloying about it. If you are searching for happy endings, search elsewhere.<br /><br />When I say that this is a romance for adults, I mean that you have to be at least 25-years old to appreciate this story of ill-fated, star-crossed and double-crossed lovers. It's far too complicated for the teenage crowd.<br /><br />In London Dan [Jude Law] meets Alice [Natalie Portman] literally by accident. A year or so later, Dan meets Anna [Julia Roberts]. He is attracted to her, but when the relationship doesn't work out, he spitefully arranges a meeting between her and Larry [Clive Owen]. Larry and Anna click. The story then gets complicated.<br /><br />The four stars give awesome performances. Except for two walk on roles, they are the only actors in the movie. Natalie Portman makes excellent use of a role that should propel her career enormously.<br /><br />Highly recommended for adults.</p></body></html>

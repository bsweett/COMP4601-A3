<meta name="summary" content="Space Opera Supreme"></head><body><p>Take a classic television series with a dedicated fanbase, insert one of its most popular villains and toss a major motion picture budget at it and what do you get:  "Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan."<br /><br />Perhaps the closest film in the "Star Trek" catalogue to the original televison series, "Khan" finds Kirk as the admiral in charge of assessing a green crew on routine training maneuvers.  They happen to be aboard his old ship, the Enterprise, and the crew includes most of his key past crewmates.  In another part of the galaxy, former crewman Chekov and his new captain are investigating a planet that may be used for Project Genesis, a device that could literally give new life to a planet.  What Chekov and his captain actually find is a man hungry for revenge:  Khan.<br /><br />Having been exiled years ago and blaming Kirk for the death of his wife, Khan puts a plan into action to bring Kirk back into his clutches in order to get revenge.<br /><br />Falling for Khan's trickery and with an inexperienced crew in tow, Kirk takes the Enterprise to Regula One, home of Project Genesis.  He hopes to find out who used his name in order to get their hands on Genesis.  Instead, he finds an ex-wife, an estranged son and one of his greatest enemies waiting to strike.  What happens next is, simply put, a wonderful blend of drama, suspense and humor as Kirk and Khan battle each other to the death.<br /><br />For a film released in 1982, "Khan" has excellent special effects.  Granted, there are a few miscues, but the story more than makes up for them.  Director Nicholas Meyer paces the film with perfection, utilizing the musical score and the individual performances of the players in order to build tension on the screen.  He guides the games between Kirk and Khan with precision.  All of the original crew do superb jobs, but I must point out that William Shatner gives his best performance ever.  Ricardo Montalban's over-the-top performance as Khan makes this film worthy of five stars.  Kirstie Alley makes her first big screen appearance and adds quite a bit of sex appeal to the film as Lt. Saavik.  That's a tough job for a person playing an emotionless Vulcan to do.<br /><br />As for the DVD, this two disc set makes up in quality what it lacks in quantity.  The digital transfer of the film is excellent.  It's one of the best transfers of a film including the original cast.  Only "Star Trek VI:  The Undiscovered Country" has a crisper looking transfer.  The sound is also very good.  There aren't as many special features included with this set when compared to the other films in this series, but they are some of the best extras you'll find.  Highlights include original interviews with DeForest Kelley, Leonard Nimoy, Shatner and Montalban as well as new interviews with Shatner, Nimoy, Montalban, Meyer and executive producer Harve Bennett.  There's also an interesting segment involving "Star Trek" authors Julia Ecklar and Greg Cox.<br /><br />Fans of "Star Trek" have most likely viewed this film already.  For those folks who haven't or for people who aren't fans of science fiction, I highly recommend "Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan" for its drama, wonderful suspense and overall story.  For fans of military films, the calculated tactics of both Kirk and Khan should keep them interested.  These are just a few of the reasons that have made this film one of the most popular of the "Star Trek" pictures.</p></body></html>

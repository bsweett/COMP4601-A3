If you take it in that light, it's not a bad movie at all. If you go in expecting Pitch Black, however, you're in for quite a disappointment.<br /><br />All the things Twohy did wrong about Pitch Black are still here (especially the confusing rapid-fire camera-angle cutting combined with lack of storyline; the same technique used to confuse and annoy the viewer during Pitch Black's crash-landing makes an appearance at the beginning of this film, as well. In Twohy's defense, he does a much better job of it about two-thirds of the way through this film), but a lot of what was right about the first film is missing. Some of that has to do with the scope of the picture; it's much easier to build complex characters when your whole cast is seven people. Riddick has a cast of thousands, and it shows; very few characters here are more than cardboard, including some of the main characters. Judi Dench is utterly wasted here (more for lack of screen time than anything inherent in her character), and Karl Urban, as the necromonger (I mean, come on, the movie has a race called necromongers. Cheese city!) sent to kill Riddick, could have had a wonderful part. Instead, he's played as two-dimensionally as possible. Etc.<br /><br />Still, if you're looking for a turn-your-brain-off action flick, you could do worse. And did you ever think you'd see Vin Diesel with hair, much less dreadlocks? **</p></body></html>

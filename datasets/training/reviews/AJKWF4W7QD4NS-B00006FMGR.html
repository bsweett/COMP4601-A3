<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly, and amazingly, well put together and good"></head><body><p>Let me start off by saying that I am not a listener of rap or hip hop music.  It's not by type of music, never has been, and never will be.  That aside however, I am an admirer of Eminem; not so much for his music, but his attitude and the unbridaled passion that he puts into his music.  Despite all the hype built up around it when first released, I went into 8 Mile with an open mind, and came out pleasently surprised.  Yes, the storyline and plot is the typical underdog comes out on top story we've seen too much of in films of the past, but thanks to the smart direction of Curtis Hanson and a surprisingly solid cast, 8 Mile ends up being far better than it should be.  Eminem may not have all the acting talent in the world, but he brings a vulnerability to the screen that will make the viewer root for him whether they are an Eminem fan or not.  Kim Basinger gets extra kudos for her role as the alcoholic mother, and Mekhi Phifer is surprisingly good as well.  All in all, 8 Mile is a surprisingly good film that is worth checking out whether your an Eminem fan (or a fan of rap music for that matter) or not.</p></body></html>

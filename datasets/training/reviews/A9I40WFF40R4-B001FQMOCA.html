<meta name="summary" content="A Fine Film About The Power Of Love"></head><body><p>President Jimmy Carter said after seeing "Cold Miner's Daughter" that the movie was much better than he expected. The same could be said about this film and then some. These kinds of movies often fall flatter than a young bride's first baked biscuits. This one doesn't. Joaquin Phoenix ("Hotel Rwanda" and "Gladiator") is just about perfect as Johnny Cash. He resembles him both in appearance and in his voice-- he does all the Cash songs himself-- and Reese Witherspoon ("Legally Blonde" and "The Importance of Being Earnest") convinced me that she was June Carter. (She sings June's songs herself as well.) Witherspoon captures the essence of the character with both her humor and decency. (It is common knowledge that Cash gave June and her mother Maybelle Carter the major credit for his getting off drugs and turning his life around.)<br /><br />Some of the minor characters are miscast. Elvis Presley for one. With more Elvis impersonators now alive than ever before in history, it is inconceivable that a better Elvis couldn't have been found. On the other hand, some of the actors with cameo parts are quite wonderful: Mother Maybelle, Johnny's mother in middle age with her cat-eye glasses and Pentecostal hairdo and the bank teller who refuses to cash Cash's check, for instance.<br /><br />Some of the best scenes are those in which Phoenix sings. When he auditions for Sam Phillips at Sun Records, after trying a tired version of the then popular religious song "I Was There When It Happened," he breaks into a gritty, soulful version of "Folsom Prison Blues" worthy of the Man in Black, himself. The concert at Folsom Prison with June in the wings is electric as well; then there is the concert in Canada where Cash proposes to Carter before an enthusiastic audience that will make your eyes water.<br /><br />Director James Mangold ("Kate & Leopold" and "Girl, Interrupted") does an excellent job of keeping Carter and Cash's relationship from becoming too sentimental and also prevents the film from turning into a religious tract since Carter and Cash became devout Christians. (Only once does June say that God has given Johnny a second chance to make something of his life.) They are portrayed here as what they apparently were in real life, two less than perfect but decent, talented people who had one of the great contemporary love affairs that spanned almost forty years. Trite as it may sound, "Walk the Line" is ultimately about the enduring power of love. This is a film you will want to see again. The soundtrack is quite fine and stands on its own. Phoenix's talent as a singer is the biggest surprise of the movie. He and Witherspoon are likely Oscar contenders for their performances.<br /><br />Apparently Johnny Cash approved of having Mr. Phoenix play him in this movie. It is sad that neither he nor his wife lived to see this production. They would both have loved it.</p></body></html>

How wrong I was! You don't realize how much picture is lost with standard 480p releases until a monumental blu ray transfer like this comes along and provides a home viewing experience that literally feels like seeing the movie for the first time.<br /><br />As far as I'm concerned, this is the best blu ray I own - and not just because The Sound of Music is probably the greatest movie ever made, but because the picture quality is truly that beautiful. And that makes sense, considering the movie was filmed in 70mm and could contain so much more data than ordinary 35mm.  Also, from what I understand, the restoration process was taken extremely seriously and done with the highest technology possible. There's a reason why so many artists are pushing blu ray, and it's because for the first time people can experience their creativity and attention to detail, as it was meant to be seen.  There is SO much detail in this movie.  Seriously, if you loved this movie before you will have your mouth dropped open the entire time you sit through it in high definition.<br /><br />And the Audio quality! I didn't even know it was possible to make ancient audio files sound brand new, but it clearly is.  Every song sounds 1000000x better than my old CD soundtracks.  Add in surround sound... heavenly.<br /><br />OVERALL: I don't care how many VHS or DVD copies you have of this movie sitting around, you NEED this blu ray.  It's not just a restoration, it's a transformation.  You cannot have truly experienced The Sound of Music at home until seeing it in 1080p.  Not to mention it's cram packed with amazing extras that are actually watchable.  In case you can't tell, this BD just makes me so happy.  If you appreciate the movie (or bless you, never seen it before) you MUST experience it on BD!</p></body></html>

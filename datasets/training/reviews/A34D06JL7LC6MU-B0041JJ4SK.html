<meta name="summary" content="Funny As Hell!!!!!!!"></head><body><p>This movie is by the same director of "Dude, Where's My Car."<br /><br />I hated "Dude, Where's My Car" so I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but this movie is truly funny as HELL. When I first saw it in a store, I read the back and frankly. It looked stupid.<br /><br />But after watching it a little less than 5 minutes I realized how good it was. It's far superior to DWMC and it's probably one of the best stoner/road trip movies since "Cheech & Chongs Up in Smoke". Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) are an asian and I think Kumar is like Arabian or something. Anyway, Harold has a job which is pretty professional but he still gets stoned every day with Kumar, whose dad pressures him to go to Med School. One night while getting stoned the two of them see a commercial for<br /><br />White Castle burgers. They suddenly get the muchies and head off to White Castle to find it's no longer there. They then begin a road trip to find the other White Castle and meet a bunch of DWMC-like people. But, see unlike DWMC, Harold and Kumar meet people that aren't as weird as the aliens that were met by the guys in DWMC. But the movie has a lot of funny one-liners, like:<br /><br />Harold: How were Katie Holmes b00bies?<br /><br />Friend: Remember the holocaust?<br /><br />Harold: Yeah.<br /><br />Friend: Picture the exact opposite of that.<br /><br />Then they meet a man named Freakshow who has large pulsing boils all over his face. When they are at his house to get their tire replaced he says:<br /><br />"Ya'll can go inside. Watch TV, get something to eat, f**k my wife. Ya know? Make yourself at home."<br /><br />A-</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Enjoyable and worth seeing, but not as good as the original"></head><body><p>This remake of the classic Pink Panther films is funny and silly, as it is supposed to be, and entertaining, as well as finely acted, but it is not as good as the classic. Peter Sellers was somehow more ridiculous and more entertaining than Steve Martin. Additionally, there is really nothing new added to this film that was not in the classic. True the plot is different and the inspector stumbled over new objects, but these changes were simply variations of what were in the classic.</p></body></html>

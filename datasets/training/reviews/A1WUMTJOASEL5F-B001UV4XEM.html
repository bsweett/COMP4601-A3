Yes folks, this kind of drug induced alcohol related amnesia can happen given the right cosmic dust. Four buddies celebrate bachelor party in Las Vegas to discover expensive royal flat is into total mayhem complete with baby, animals, destruction, and missing unaccounted for partner who happens to be the groom. Many disarray pieces lay strewn about with only telltale clues from casual witnesses who happened to be there as well as quickie bride, victims of crime, and stolen articles. If anyone has seen the legendary comedy flick "It's a mad, mad, mad, mad world" then you know the unstoppable pace to this one as the three out of it buddies try to piece their whereabouts' and solve the mysteries of telltale leftovers and disappearing vehicle, plus missing buddie. A great romp of who did it, and why it happened as they gradually backtrack their drunken stupor steps, with a satisfying ending of tell all phone photographs after the mysteries have been solved for a pleasant closing credits roll.</p></body></html>

Now we are presented with "Journey to the Center of the Earth."  However, this movie does give us a good synopsis of the story.  Moreover, it is very much fun to watch.<br /><br />Prof. Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser) has lost a brother. Professor Anderson's nephew Sean Anderson (Josh Hutcherson) has lost a father. Well circumstances force them to spend some time together.  They realize that they might be able to find the lost Max Anderson and make a trip to Iceland in pursuit.  They are bigger and across the tasty mountain guide Hannah &Aacute;sgeirsson (Anita Briem), who has recently lost her father.  Both Hannah's father, and Trevor's brother had one thing in common; they were Vernians. So all three each bringing their own unique talents, set off to find the lost Max Anderson.<br /><br />I first watched the 2D version of this movie in Blu-ray high definition.  Some of the scenes were quite beautiful, such as the diamonds that had the lights behind them, so they would glisten in the cave.  The movie did look a little bit like it was cranked out at the last minute with many things not thought out.  However, it was still fun for the time that it lasted.<br /><br />Now it was time to watch the 3-D version.  I put on my trusty red and green glasses that came with the DVD.  I must say I am not sure why they switched from red and blue, to red and green.  However, it might have something to do with the fact that televisions are made up of three colors of light red, green, and blue.  The military also change their lighting from red at night light to green night light for some reason.  Therefore, we are not aware of something afoot.  In any event, it took about 15 seconds to get used to the new color environment.  In addition, I must say that some of the scenes are spectacular.  The trilobite at first may be halved almost at back of the seat. Of course, with the exception of the color change the technology has not changes since the origins of 3D. Other scenes instead of extending out into the viewer's space recessed back and looked like the old stereoscopic slides. Occasionally there looked like a pane of glass with a reflection of what was behind it. I am not sure if this was sloppy manufacturing or beyond the technology even of today.  No matter the problem, it is well worth the viewing and I hope this will catch on as an industry option.<br /><br />This comes with a digital download. I have not tried it yet. I have watched the picture in picture voice over which added to the second viewing.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1603400281">"A Journey to the Center of the Earth" by Jules Verne</a><br /><br />3D GLASSES - Journey to the Center of the Earth DVD Extra 3D Glasses (3 Pairs)</p></body></html>

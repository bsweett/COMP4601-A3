Great peformances, fantastic direction, and a bone-tingling plot, Psycho is one film not to be missed. This film still gives me goosebumps, probably seen it 50 times and each time I watch it I see something I never noticed before. I highly recommend this "mother" of a movie, enjoy!</p></body></html>

After watching this pseudo-Superhero movie, I thought I had just watched my first Quentin Tarantino movie. With all the F-bombs and extreme violence, I will not recommend this movie for anything.<br /><br />Seriously, the characters say the "F" word about 100 times! That is enough to sicken me - for any movie.<br /><br />The violence and gore is over-the-top. Simply not needed. I don't care if this is based on a bloody graphic novel.<br /><br />This movie stars a bunch of no-namers who desire to be superheroes (you can tell by the cover of the DVD. I haven't read the graphic novel so I wasn't sure what to expect.<br /><br />The only -ONLY- redeeming value of this movie was the storyline of Nicolas Cage's character, Big Daddy. His superhero costume resembles Batman's and he even talks like Adam West's version of Batman.<br /><br />It was fun to see Cage beat up the bad guys. But again, the blood and gore was too much.<br /><br />As a taste of what's in store for the gore: they microwave a guy!<br /><br />Insane and a waste of time.<br /><br />Do not watch this movie.</p></body></html>

Gainey and Jeffrey Tambor,<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Dan Fogleman<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Nathan Greno and Byron Howard<br /><br />Rated: PG<br />Genre: Animation / Comedy<br />Release Date: 24 November 2010<br />Review Date: 31 December 2010<br /><br />Now here is a film I was not expecting much from, that delivered an amazing time at the movies! What a discredit to the film, the trailer for Tangled was. It's a take on the timeless tale of Rapunzel: the girl with incredibly long hair who has been locked away in a tower. Disney has revamped the story, complete with some zany modern day jargon and the vocal talent of Mandy Moore.<br /><br />Disney takes us back to the likes of classic stories such as Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin. Tangled is a much simpler film than those, as far as plot and characters are concerned, but it feels just as magical. The animation is stunning, and there is some amazing cinematography; something I really enjoy seeing amidst the colorful backdrop of an animated landscape. Oh, Rapunzel's tall tower, tucked away at the edge of a forest by a waterfall. It reminded me of something Lara Croft would stumble across in a Tomb Raider game.<br /><br />The movie is also very funny. We meet a guy named Flynn (voiced by Zachary Levi) who much like Aladdin, is a thief but isn't the worst of guys. He's hilarious, charming and cunning and he's about to meet his match: Rapunzel.<br /><br />Rapunzel (Mandy Moore) was kidnapped at a young age by an evil woman fed up with her aging looks. She took her from her home because she possesses a few very strange gifts that allow her to work miracles. The one of most importance to our villain being that when she sings, her hair glows and can transform the decrepit old woman into one hot little animated dish of yummy. The woman raises Rapunzel as her own daughter.<br /><br />Every year on Rapunzel's birthday, magical lights that hold meaning to the story, light up the sky. She is fascinated by this and dreams of seeing them up close, as she can only see them from her window. For fear that she will be found out; the mother forbids her from ever leaving the dusty old tower that is so high up, access can only be gained by the lowering of a very long rope. Or a very long ponytail!<br /><br />Naturally, Flynn happens upon Rapunzel's tower by mistake when fleeing from someone he's just robbed. While her mother is away on a three day trip, Rapunzel decides to call on the aid of Flynn. Stashing away his precious stolen high dollar item, she blackmails him into taking her to see the lights before she will return it to him.<br /><br />And thus their adventure begins, and only looks better in 3D, so go see it!</p></body></html>

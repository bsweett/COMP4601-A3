Suffice to say, the movie is nonstop action, violence, CGI monsters and lots of fight scenes.  Kate Beckinsale brings an earthy feminism to her role as Selene, while Scott Speedman underplays his role as the hybrid lycan/vampire.  Tony Curran is a despicable villain and Sir Derek Jacobi brings an Ian McKellenish finesse to his role as the perpetrator of the lycan/vampire bloodline.  The effects are quite good and although the hyperkinetic cinematography and the frequent blue tint can be distracting, the movie is well done.  A third film is probably inevitable but if it's as good as this one, well done!!!</p></body></html>

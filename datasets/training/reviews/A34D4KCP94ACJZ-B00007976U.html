<meta name="summary" content="Williams is Outstanding in a Great Looking Movie"></head><body><p>One Hour Photo is a film about a lonely man who develops film at "SavMart".  His name is Sy Parrish (Robin Williams) and his job is really all he has.  There are social ingredients missing in Sy's mind, and as we get to closer to him we begin to put the pieces together.  He has nothing to live for outside of his job and the family that are his favorite customers.  The Yorkins; Nina (Connie Nielsen), Will (Michael Vartan), and their only child Jake are the customers Sy most enjoys producing prints for.  He sees them as the ideal family and he loves them so much that he creates copies of their prints for himself and he calls himself "uncle" Sy.  Unfortunately for Sy, the Yorkins are not aware of any of this.  Sy is awkward and socially inept.  He walks through life without the ability to relate appropriately with others and it begins to weigh in on him.  So what happens if Will Yorkin's friend Maya shows up with a roll of film of her own, and the pictures show her being intimate with Will?  What will Uncle Sy do?<br /><br />There is a genuine creepiness to Director Mark Romanek's One Hour Photo.  Romanek's ability to organize images to appropriately translate in the music video medium is evidently a solid carryover to his work as a feature filmmaker.  This movie has a remarkably unique feel to it and where most films of this genre would focus on the Yorkins as the protagonists, One Hour Photo has us staring directly at the empty and profoundly sad Sy Parrish.  Jeff Cronenweth, the film's cinematographer, also deserves immense praise for his blinding white SavMart shots and overall crisp photography.  The setting becomes Sy's element effortlessly, which is convenient because SavMart is Sy.  He has nothing to go home to.  The most praise though should land squarely upon Robin Williams.  His role is a completely unrecognizable transformation and even though he received praise and a Saturn Award, he may have received more if this performance was in a different genre.<br /><br />There is something about the way One Hour Photo unfolds that is appropriate but invariably predictable.  The ending doesn't hit as hard as the effective (and credit-less) opening scenes.  It's hard to say whether that is a criticism of the second half of One Hour Photo or a gigantic compliment to the first half.  I can't imagine a better ending that wouldn't come off as overly contrived or too psychological but all of this is very much just nitpicking.  One Hour Photo is a very good movie carried primarily by its lead performance and its original atmosphere.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Promise of Movie-Making"></head><body><p>Current special effects and our ability to think permits us virtually unlimited possibilities for movies.  In spite of the possibilities, rarely do film makers take full advantage of what is available to them.  Director James McTeigue and writers Alan Moore (who created "V for Vendetta" as a comic), Andy Wachowski, and Larry Wachowski have taken a concept never before seen in the movies and created a marvelous, enjoyable and entertaining film.<br /><br />Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt) has used a series of wars to create a fascist government in England.  There is an inside joke in this choice of actors.  John Hurt previously played Winston Smith in the movie "1984," and he essentially is Big Brother in this movie.  The movie provides us with the history of Guy Fawkes at the very beginning of the movie.  Guy Fawkes failed in an attempt to blow up Parliament on November 5, 1605.  The character V uses a mask of Guy Fawkes to cover his face from the very beginning of the movie.  It takes little imagination to realize that V has some fireworks of his own planned.  Later we learn that V is mostly likely horribly disfigured and the mask may be to save us from seeing V as he really is.<br /><br />Much of what we learn about V comes from his interaction with Evey Hammond (Natalie Portman), who V rescued from a couple of policemen that were about to rape Evey.  Unfortunately, Evey's life takes a nasty turn when she helps V.  Evey's only choice is to stay with V.<br /><br />Other than the introduction and the distraction provided by Evey, who we need so that the story of V can unfold, the remainder of the movie focuses on V and his escapades.  What wonderful escapades they are, and how bizarrely the conflict between V and Sutler proceeds.  We see little of Sutler except as an image on monitors until the very end of the movie.  The monitor is Sutler's mask.  We never see V's face, and V never directly confronts Sutler until the end of the movie.  Even at the end, the confrontation is indirect.  I dare not say more without spoiling the plot further.<br /><br />The result of the interesting progression of this movie is that of a chess game where we see the result of the moves, but the players are rarely, if ever, present.<br /><br />The selection of John Hurt as Sutler and Hugo Weaving as V was brilliant.  Hurt is absolutely sinister and nearly insane as he feels control slipping away.  Hurt executes his role with perfection, and there are places where I thought he was on the edge of frothing at the mouth.<br /><br />Weaving is casual, with a sonorous voice that borders on sinister, and yet can be incredibly romantic.  Weaving brings sadness to his role that is sensed at first in his voice.  V will do what he has to do, but it does not bring him pleasure.  He is logical in his actions and purposeful, without emotion.  V's actions were set in motion by events that happened to him, and we accept those actions as V has accepted them.  V acts like the steps he is taking are equivalent to taking out the garbage or raking the yard.  He must do what he is doing, regardless of the consequences.  His actions are the only purpose he has in his life.<br /><br />One aspect of this film has generated controversy.  Is it acceptable for someone to violently overthrow a government?  We would say no.  However, in this movie the government is no longer democratic.  Sutler is an absolute dictator.  There is no possibility for the government to be representative.  While terrorism, which is what V does, is abhorrent, a fascist government that will not permit a change in government is also abhorrent.  If there was another way to resolve the problems facing England in this movie, I am unable to see what that way was.<br /><br />If this movie makes people wonder, as it made me wonder, or if it makes people think, as it made me think, then the movie has done a wonderful thing.  This movie is creative, thought-provoking, well-plotted, and entertaining.  While this movie may have flaws, I was so caught up in the story and spent so much time trying to think about the story that I failed to spot any.<br /><br />If you enjoy thought-provoking science fiction, try this movie.  I thought it was wonderful, and look forward to watching it again.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="graphic violence and lots of fear"></head><body><p>I remember when both Alien and Predator were popular movies.  BOTH had me pretty frightened as a young child with his mind constantly wondering and unsure what was even going on!<br /><br />Now, many years later, I'm an adult now, and yet, I still feel somewhat scared when I watch the movies, because they portray humans unable to defend themselves against these huge POWERFUL creatures, and I think that's the thing that bothers me the most.<br /><br />Alien vs. Predator was disturbing in that, it seemed whenever someone lost their life, their friends and family would die next, in graphic ways.<br /><br />This movie shows everything from little kids having aliens shoot from their bellies while hunting in the woods, to pregnant women in hospitals having aliens munch through their stomach and stick their sharp dangerous teeth in the air, while the patients and nurses were forced to watch these graphic things happen.<br /><br />This made Alien vs. Predator a VERY scary film.  One I highly recommend.  Everything from nurses getting their heads popped off, to sharp teeth chewing on peoples faces, to a pizza delivery boy getting his buns kicked by the new boyfriend of his ex-girlfriend.<br /><br />It WILL be a bit hard keeping track of what's going on half the time though, because there's like, 20 different main characters in the film, showcasing a variety of different friends and families, and because the film takes place at night time for the most part, it's hard to tell who actually won the fight between the alien and the predator.  I think the creature with green juice squirting out of him lost.<br /><br />There WERE some predictable moments though, such as the monsters swimming through swimming pools while people were in the pool, and you KNEW they would swim after the people.<br /><br />The amount of blood is very very high throughout the film.<br /><br />Oh, and the ending scene is VERY cool.</p></body></html>

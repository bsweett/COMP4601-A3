<meta name="summary" content="Don't turn your back on this 'Queen'"></head><body><p>Should have been the Oscar winner for best picture -- it was by far the best and most involving movie I saw last year. Helen Mirren took best actress gold for her astonishing portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II, caught between worlds in the days following the death of Diana.<br /><br />The DVD comes with two commentaries: an upbeat one on the production from director Stephen Frears and screeenwriter Peter Morgan, and another from Robert Lacey, an expert on the royal family. Lacey serves admirably as a translator for the folks in Region 1, who almost certainly missed many references whilst viewing the film in theaters. It's a highly recommended talk for admirers of the film who want an enriched  viewing experience the second or third time around.<br /><br />The other extras are efficient but routine making-ofs. Mirren says she became comfortable in the role by thinking of herself as painting a portrait, a process in which the artist's role is to bring some of herself to the finished subjective work.<br /><br />Video and audio on the standard DVD release are as you'd expect, sturdy and well-bred.</p></body></html>

As others have often stated, Robert Downey, Jr. makes a fabulous, half-hapless hero.  Gwyneth Paltrow is alluring and likable as his caring, but witty assistant, Pepper, and Jeff Bridges makes a welcome return as "Oby" Stane.  Terrence Howard is believable as gung ho Colonel Rhodes.  Directed with finesse by Jon Favreau.)<br /><br />A J.P.'s Pick 4.5 *'s= Very Good-Exceptional</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Family Affair"></head><body><p>The newest version of &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; has an almost insurmountable chasm to overcome what with the superior reputation of the 1960's version of this story staring it in it's proverbial face. And even though on most counts the new version equals or surpasses the aforementioned film, in one crucial point...it doesn't. And that one crucial point is in the performance of Meryl Streep.<br /> Now, there is no doubt that Streep is a National treasure and that she has given us many indelible performances but her Eleanor, is too mannered, so much of a &quot;performance,&quot; that she loses her character thread early on and her portrayal becomes caricature. Compare her Eleanor to Angela Lansbury's in the original: Lansbury is all motherly, Oedipal, crafty, intelligent, cunning, a &quot;real&quot; amoral snake willing to do anything to gain power.<br /> Updating the Richard Condon novel, director Demme and his writers have done an exceptional job of turning the red-scare, Cold War era of the early 60's into our post 9/11 times. The main theme remains intact, though: the underlying feeling and sense that our government is somehow, someway turning us into robots, playing with our minds or at least experimenting doing so. It's the &quot;1984,&quot; Big Brother is watching thing that is just as strong now as it was 40 years ago.<br /> Denzel Washington dominates this film in a performance that is the logical extension of his performance as the beat-down, lonely, alcoholic Creasy in &quot;Man on Fire.&quot; In this film he has shaken off all remnants of his hero persona and dug as deep as he can go to his core: he's frightened, he's crazy and he's a man with a mission; a very potent cocktail of character traits.<br /> Unfortunately, a telling and shocking moment between Eleanor and her son Raymond (Liev Schreiber) has been cut since the preview that would have added much to the final form of the movie. But nonetheless, &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; is a wallop in the stomach of a movie. One that you will not soon forget.</p></body></html>

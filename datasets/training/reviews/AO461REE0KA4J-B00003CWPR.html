<meta name="summary" content="Great film, still censored"></head><body><p>Kubrick's last film is an existential tour de force.  It is a fascinating exploration into the sexual mores of modern man, handled with a masterful melding of subject matter and style that is typical of Kubrick.  Nudity is plentiful, but there is hardly any overt sex, for one of the movie's themes is REPRESSION.  The duality of human nature (recalling the line in FULL METAL JACKET) is once again the driving force of the plot: love/hate, honesty/deceit, reality/fantasy, freedom/repression, etc.  Kitman's performance is great.  Cruise's is alright.  Kubrick, well, is Kubrick.<p>This DVD is the R-rated version, and so is the remastered DVD edition to be released this June.  The unrated version without the censored scenes that Kubrick had objected to is not yet available as a Region 1 DVD.  In fact, no one in North America has seen the uncensored version.</p></body></html>

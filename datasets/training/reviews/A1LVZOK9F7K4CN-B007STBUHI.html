I've noticed some people dump on the special effects as &quot;pre-CGI&quot;.  This movie is the argument AGAINST CGI.  Don't believe me?  Watch &quot;The Deep Blue Sea.&quot;<p>As for the DVD itself, a lot of the material was all ready included on the 20th Anniversary VHS--notably, the Spielberg interviews.  However, that was just VHS.  This also contains many of the deleted scenes which (although clearly left out for a reason) are still quite enjoyable to watch.  This DVD sounds like no other broadcast version I've heard; compare this whale-song to the one on VHS.  Also, this is a completely different movie seen in widescreen format.  If you're a Jaws fan, you have to own this DVD.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Gold Standard..."></head><body><p>Sean Connery's third outing as James Bond in 1964's superb "Goldfinger" has the 007 franchise solidifying its primary thematic elements.  Connerly is smoothly witty and deadly as the British Secret Service assassin.  The exotic villain is one Auric Goldfinger, played by veteran German actor Gert Frobe, out to corner the world's gold supply. His evil henchman is Oddjob, a giant, mute Korean martial arts expert whose special touch is a bowler hat with a steel rim.  The Bond girl of the moment is Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman), Goldfinger's pilot, who will fall for Bond, as they always do.<br /><br />Bond's assignment is to infiltrate Goldfinger's organization, learn his plans, and stop them.  Bond and Goldfinger will play an exciting game of cate and mouse, with Bond repeatedly surviving close calls to stay close to Goldfinger.  The climax of the movie is Goldfinger's raid on Fort Knox, inside the vault of which Bond will have his final confrontation with the seemingly indestructable Oddjob.<br /><br />Shirley Eaton figures in an iconic scene early in the movie as Jill Masterson, one of Goldfinger's assistants who is seduced by Bond.  Goldfinger gets his revenge by having her body covered with gold paint, causing her death by suffocation.  Bond's discovery of her body helps set him on a collision course with Goldfinger.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as one of the best of the original Bond movies based on Ian Fleming's novels.</p></body></html>

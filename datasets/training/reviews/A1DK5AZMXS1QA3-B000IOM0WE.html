<meta name="summary" content="Good sci-fi flick starring hot babes"></head><body><p>It seems that every hot actress needs to star in at least one comic-book or sci-fi action flick to show of her athleticism, long legs, perfect tone and great figure.  Angelina Jolie had Tomb Raider, Halle Berry had Catwoman, Pamela Andersen had Barb Wire, and now Charlize Theron has Aeon Flux.  Fortunately, this one is actually very good.  Set in the distant future on an Earth decimated by a plague, Ms. Theron plays the title character, an assassin of incredible skill, beauty and ruthlessness.  The movie is about her latest mission, and how her discoveries on this mission change her and mankind.  This movie is based of a comic-book, which I have not read, so I have no comment on how faithful this film is to the original story.  However, I can say the movie is quite good, with great special effects, a plot that was original compared to other action flicks, and Ms. Theron was aptly displayed.  Overall, a very entertaining movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Film-making and acting"></head><body><p>Nicole Kidman is excellent (as are the other cast) in this well done movie !<br /><br />Released in the wake of the "Sixth Sense"-type movies, it does not quite have the super twist surprise that 6th Sense does, but is it a great film and example of movie-making and acting at it's best.<br /><br />Now a part of our permanent DVD collection !</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Brave Raves"></head><body><p>The Good Things:<br />-Not a bad concept.<br />-Not a bad character; it is interesting to see how she turns wicked. More interesting to see her inner conflicts and emotions.<br />-Emotionally strong.<br />-Camera style is kind of wierd. It's smooth, but it still moves around a lot and has very mesmerizing parts.<br />-Dark and dreadful portrayal of city life, with rampant criminals willing to beat everybody up (scary!).<br />-Good suspense throughout.<br /><br />The Bad Things:<br />-Slow paced.<br /><br />This is basically "Death Wish" with Jodie Foster instead of Charles Bronson (between the two, I would prefer "Death Wish" for its 1970's grittiness). This film is much more modernized, with clean, smooth, hypnotic shots. One could say that it is even visually appealing. To top it off, it has strong emotions (certainly enough to overpower "Death Wish"). The beating scene is particuarly brutal and sad. The only problem I have is that this film is that it is slowly paced, and for a full 122 minute movie, it gets a little tedious.<br /><br />I would reccomend this for people who are interested in thrillers. Fans of cop films or other vigilante films (like "Death Wish") may also be interested, but be aware that it is based more on suspense and characterization, not action.</p></body></html>

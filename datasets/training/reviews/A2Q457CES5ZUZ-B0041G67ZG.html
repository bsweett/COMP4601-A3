<meta name="summary" content="The Suspense Never Slackens"></head><body><p>Non-stop suspense is the order with Sydney Pollack's deftly directed "The Interpreter" as Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn, two talented Oscar winners, interact fluidly in a film that, in addition to entertaining, has a good deal to say about the current international political scene.<br /><br />Kidman, a United Nations interpreter who has come to New York in hopes of working for peace, overhears a telephone conversation in which two men talk about assassinating a controversial African head of state.  Kidman is one of the few people in town capable of understanding the conversation since the language is that of her home country, an African nation headed by a ruthless strongman who was once a popular military leader but was corrupted ultimately by power and turned against his own people.<br /><br />Sean Penn, in the midst of tragedy following his wife's death only three weeks earlier, works in a special branch of the Secret Service. When asked to investigate Kidman's revelation he is initially skeptical, but when activities begin heating up and an African is killed by his roommate he realizes that danger lurks.<br /><br />Circumstances are compounded by the fact that the UN wishes to pursue legal means through the International Criminal Court and that an assassination could make the victim a martyr in the eyes of the people of his nation and further compound instability there.  In the interim the dictatorial strongman is on his way to the UN to address the General Assembly in hopes that he can sway negative public opinion in his direction.<br /><br />As the story develops it becomes clear that Kidman has a personal stake in the outcome of the emerging tragedy beyond being a citizen of the nation in question.  It is learned that the dictator victimized her family, and that previously she along with so many of the nation's citizenry had admired him greatly.<br /><br />As the film nears its breathtaking climax Kidman has an opportunity to speak with the dictator.  The question is whether she will attempt to deal with him on her own rather than letting international law take its course.  Penn is on the scene and uses his influence to steer matters to a peaceful conclusion in which legality will prevail.</p></body></html>

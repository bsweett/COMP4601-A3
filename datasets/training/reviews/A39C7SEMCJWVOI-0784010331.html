<meta name="summary" content="TOTAL RECALL"></head><body><p>TOTAL RECALL is a big-budget, ultraviolent, science-fiction/action movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Doug Quaid, a happily married construction worker who is constantly dreaming about Mars. Suddenly, Doug is confronted with the realization that his memory was probably erased and that he is actually a secret agent from Mars. Now, a group of Mars Intelligence agents are out to kill Doug, including his own wife, and the only people who can help him are a mysterious woman named Melina and an army of rebellious mutants. The movie manages to keep you guessing whether these things are actually happening to Quaid, or if he is having an elaborate Mars-influenced dream? At the end of the film you are not sure if it's all a dream or reality?</p></body></html>

I won't add much more except to say that the movie works so well because it blends the best of Star Trek - humor, action, and a morality play - into one package. The film has some genuinely funny moments, especially when Drs. Cochrane and Lilly are forced to adapt to 24th century technology and expectations.<br /><br />Given its reputation as an action-packed battle against the Borg, there aren't that many action sequences in First Contact, but those that are included are deliberate, emotionally tense, and advance the plot. Jonathan Frakes (also William Riker) made some interesting decisions in portraying the fighting scenes. Often, the best moments occur just before or after the battles start, when the Borg seem indomitable. Unfortunately, the producers learned the wrong lessons from First Contact's success and overdosed on the action scenes in Insurrection and Nemesis (which actually has its moments, despite the action scenes).<br /><br />Finally, First Contact contains two morality plays. The first focuses on Picard's thirst for revenge against the Borg. The second disabuses viewers of the notion that historical visionaries need have a saintly persona. Dr. Zefram Cochrane, the inventor of the warp drive, comes across as a self-absorbed alcoholic. However, as viewers learn to readjust their expectations to fit the man, Cochrane also comes to realize that he can be a man and be part of history.<br /><br />It's a shame that nearly 10 years after the last TNG film aired First Contact is really the only TNG film that stands as unanimously beloved. Despite what many producers and market analysts claim, it's not simply because First Contact uses the Borg and time travel as plot devices - although both work well. Rather, it's because it combines the best of Star Trek. Hopefully future Star Trek movies will learn these lessons.</p></body></html>

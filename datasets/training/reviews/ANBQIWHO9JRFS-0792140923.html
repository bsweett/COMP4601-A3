<meta name="summary" content="Hopelessly self-important, dull"></head><body><p>Normally I wouldn't bother to write a review for a film of this sort, but I find it so damn irritating that I've gotta say my piece, though I'll bet many others have said approximately the same thing.  From a sheer entertainment standpoint the film isn't too bad, at first.  Forrest goes on adventures, they are passably amusing.  The second half of the film is incredibly dull and all that sh*t with his stupid hippie loser girlfriend is unbearable. Also, though there's no denying that Hanks is an extremely good actor I'm not especially impressed with his performance here.  Everyone seems to think that affected, gimmicky performances are the most impressive thing, but I don't buy it.  Hell back in 6th grade there was this semi-retarded chick that I used to imitate for my friends and lemme tell ya my performance was spot on AND hilarious. Gimmie an Oscar, I rule the acting I do.<br /><br />But what I really hate about this movie is how it's such a major example of the baby boom generations love affair with itself.  Chuck Klosterman summed up the problems with them pretty neatly and I'm gonna quote him as best I can from memory: 'Baby Boomers are convinced that they are the most important generation ever.  THEY ended the war, THEY had things they believed in.  There is nothing more pompous and condescending than a nostalgic baby boomer.' I wish I had the exact quote, but that's the gist of it, and he goes on to note how baby boomers are obsessed with how revolutionary they are and yet they inherited the establishment and ended up keeping pretty much everything the same.  And it's not just that it's about the generation.  That's not necessarily a problem it just reeks of the whole 'God are we amazing attitude'.  I've heard it all before and I'm not interested.  However, if you're a narcissistic baby boomer, knock youself out.<br /><br />Grade: D+</p></body></html>

I thought I'd think it was mediocre at best. I was so wrong. I loved it. The animation is great, and the voice acting is perfect for each character. And, those characters are also great! It has that perfect blend of action and humor, however that action still seems kid-friendly in some way. The humor is quite funny and you shall laugh at least once! I really recommend this! -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare</p></body></html>

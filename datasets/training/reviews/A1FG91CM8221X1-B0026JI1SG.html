<meta name="summary" content="An old-fashioned melodrama, extraordinarily well-done."></head><body><p>Despite the insistence of some critics that "Million Dollar Baby" is a notably fresh, surprising and original movie, don't believe it. It's an old-fashioned, five-hanky, melodramatic weeper, basically notable for the way that screenwriter Paul Haggis and director-star Clint Eastwood graft one familiar plot onto another to change the movie's direction, abruptly and  completely, about two-thirds of the way through. (It's no fair to say precisely what they do, or how they do it; but if you know what people generally do in boxing rings, it isn't a particularly surprising plot twist.) But if you've seen both stories before, seldom have you seen either story done with such conviction, polish, and restrained yet powerful emotion. Eastwood, one of Hollywood's smoothest old pros, milks every scene for maximum impact, and gets marvelous chiaroscuro effects out of cinematographer Tom Stern as well as believably grungy, gritty sets from production designer Henry Bumstead. Eastwood's also at the top of his game as an actor here; his scenes with another great old pro, Morgan Freeman, are wonderful to watch, like Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus matching each other shot for shot on the back nine. Haggis gives Eastwood and Freeman sharp, incisive dialogue that is fully worthy of their artistry. But the standout here is Hilary Swank, who proves beyond doubt that her mesmerizing, Oscar-winning performance in "Boys Don't Cry" was no fluke. In a role that makes both extreme physical and emotional demands, Swank creates one of the most heartrending, lovably three-dimensional heroines in recent movie history.</p></body></html>

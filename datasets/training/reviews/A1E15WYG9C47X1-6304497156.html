<meta name="summary" content="Untouchable"></head><body><p>Night of Living Dead is one of my all time favorite movies, and certainly one of the scariest ever made, a brilliant feature debut by George Romero,so I very much looked forward to this edition, expecting a lot, but unfortunately being disappointed for several reasons,<br />Many films for their DVD release or re-release have additional scenes included, usually scenes that were cut from the original due to lenght restriction (Dances with Wolves, Amadeus) or ones that the director at the time decided to cut for artistic reasons only to be restored later (Exorcist).With Night of the Living Dead, the filmmakers decided to film new scenes and drop them in the original film, to add and explain ,(as they claim),more than they could have done back in '68. Having watched both versions, and being a fan of the film for years, I did have a problem with that.For one, the added scenes did not really add much to the film itself, on the contrary, the scenes added at the beginning and end of the film took a lot of power from the original. The opening scene of the car driving through the cemetry which immediately set the tone and atmosphere of the film,is preceded in the new version with a scene of the burial of the original 'zombie', as if to give a background for what will happen next. But for me personally what I liked so much about the movie is the when and where and not the why the zombies roam.Moreover,the last scene in the original film was extremely powerful, unexpected and ironic, to add new scenes with the reporter and a demented reverend is not only totally unnecessary but it somehow ruins the 'in your face' raw ending.<br />The other disappointment is the making of featurette. For a 30th anniversary edition of this classic, one would expect a feature lenght making of segment, for I believe there would be so many on camera contributions and anecdotes, but the real making of we get comes from the audio commentary, and instead the making of on the DVD extra is just 9 minutes long, and mainly about the filming of these new additional scenes.<br />However, the new transfer of the original film is of excellent quality, and it does enhance the enjoyment of film.<br />So my full marks go to the original 1968 version on this DVD, since a Night of the Living Dead is a classic that should remain untouched.</p></body></html>

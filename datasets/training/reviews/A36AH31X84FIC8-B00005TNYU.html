<meta name="summary" content="A Note To Richard Donner And Warners From a Goonies Fan."></head><body><p>i just  love the goonies it's a wonderful film and a childhood fav. i do have to say that warners should do a special edition of this classic film and restore the scenes that were cut from film. i saw a version of this film with the scenes in it and quite prefer that version over this one. don't get me wrong i love this film but it made far more sense with those scenes in the film then without. So Please Mr. Donner think about it, you already have done a special edition of your other films like Superman. So why not this Classic? it would'nt be much work to restore the scenes anyway. You could do a Special edition package with  both discs of both versions in it. just thought from a fan.<br /><br />P.S.  anyone else reading this if you get a chance to visit where the  Goonies were filmed it's a blast such a nice town too.  visit imdb  for the locations. Goonie Rock and Mikey's House are Awsome to see!<br /><br />Highly Recommended Film.<br /><br />Heyyyy-- You Guys!! a quote. i could'nt help myself.</p></body></html>

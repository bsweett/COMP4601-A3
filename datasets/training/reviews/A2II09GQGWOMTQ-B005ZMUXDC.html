<meta name="summary" content="A pleasant surprise."></head><body><p>I guess over the years I've gotten really spoiled by Pixar.<br />With the exception of the Shrek movies I tend to shy away from other animated movies.<br />I was curious enough to rent Tangled since it was based on a Bro's. Grimm story.<br />I was hoping Disney would do the story justice and...they did.<br />Excellent characters, they all developed at a fast and interesting pace.<br />Excellent story telling.<br />Direction, art, animation were all beautifully done.<br />The one thing I really don't like about old Disney films is the constant singing.<br />That's probably why I like the Pixar movies better but thankfully Disney toned down the singing this time around with more humor.<br />Heck even the songs themselves were funny.<br />I loved this movie and will be buying the 3D version.<br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

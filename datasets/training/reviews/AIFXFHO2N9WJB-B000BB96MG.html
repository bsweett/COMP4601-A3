Each partner in the collaboration walks away a winner, mostly because the movie that was worked on was a success, earning them more respect, bigger star power, and sometimes even critical acclaim. There are currently a few big name collaborations that have been prominent over the last few years, George Clooney and Steven Soderbergh ("Ocean's 11-13"), Christian Bale and Christopher Nolan ("Batman Begins" and "The Prestige"), Kevin Smith and the batch of actors that have appeared in almost every one of his films (from "Mallrats" to "Clerks 2"). But there is one collaboration that has existed longer than the others, since the 1990 release of "Edward Scissorhands", the collaborators are, of course, Johnny Depp ('Pirates of the Caribbean' trilogy) and director Tim Burton ("Batman"). What's impressive about this particular collaboration, sure the length of time is quite a feat by Hollywood standards, but the fact that this collaboration remains so powerful at the box office is astonishing. Almost every one of Johhny Depp's and Tim Burton's movies have turned a profit. In 2007, the duo came together yet again for the movie "Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street", but before this film the two worked on the remake of the Roald Dahl children's classic "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory", the novel that had been previously adapted in 1971 with "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory".<br /><br />"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" is the story of a sweet, good-hearted little boy named Charlie (Freddie Highmore) who lives in a rundown shack with his mother, father, and both sets of grandparents. They have next to nothing to live on, and Charlie's birthday is coming up, and the only thing they can afford is one single candy bar. But not just any candy bar, a Wonka Bar, made at the mysterious Wonka Chocolate Factory located in the same town. What makes the factory so mysterious is that not a single person has been seen coming or going from that factory in 15 years, that is until an announcement goes out to the whole world that 5 lucky people will be selected to visit the factory and meet the reclusive owner, Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp). Most of Charlie's life, good fortune has been rather elusive, but one lucky day changes everything as Charlie finds one of the 5 golden tickets that will give him access to Wonka's factory, and the wonders that Charlie will behold will change his life forever.<br /><br />When I first heard about this movie's release, I wasn't all that excited to see it, in fact I didn't even want to see it at all. For starters, I didn't care a whole lot for the original movie "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" starring Gene Wilder, so I didn't really see what I would find of interest here. Plus, the original film was so well received by critics and audiences, that I didn't understand the point behind making this updated version. However, one day I recorded the movie off of the Showtime network, and figured what the heck, I'll give it a try. I mean, it's Johnny Depp and Tim Burton together again, just how bad could this movie be.<br /><br />Truth be told, the movie's not all that bad. It's obvious the reason that Depp and Burton continue collaborating is that there is a chemistry there that allows their work together to be so successful, and "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" was at least a decent addition to their list of collaborations, though not their best by any means.<br /><br />As one could easily tell from the previews, and possibly the DVD cover for that matter, the movie is strange, no doubt about that. There's a lot of weird things that occur in the movie, some that happened in the original, and some new, but the story is actually quite endearing as you watch this young boy's innocence begins to reach this reclusive man, showing him that reaching out and trusting in others will bring a sense of belonging into his life. There were some elements to the film that I didn't care for, primarily the song numbers, they were just flat-out irritating to listen to, and I found myself skipping ahead to the end of the song as they did nothing more than slow the movie down. Some of the characters were extremely annoying, but that's not so much the actors fault as it was simply the way the character was meant to be, but I still didn't care for them and couldn't wait for them to get off the screen.<br /><br />Performance wise, Johnny Depp did an excellent job as the quirky eccentric Willy Wonka, a role I was surprised that Depp was chosen for, but his chameleon-like ways with characters continued to serve him well in this movie. Some critics of the film felt Depp's portrayal was a bit too much like Michael Jackson, leaving them with a creepy feeling when Wonka was on screen. Personally I didn't read that into his Depp's performance, though I can maybe see how some might think that. The other standout performance was Freddie Highmore's, this talented young actor, who previously appeared in "Finding Neverland" with Johnny Depp, convincingly conveyed the innocence and naive view of the world that Charlie possessed, and he seemed like the perfect good kid, to the point he was a little unbelievable as a character. Charlie's character, in this film, was just too perfect, he listened and obeyed everything that Wonka requested, yet in the original, if I remember correctly both he and his grandpa snuck away to mess around in some bubble room that caused them to fly for a little bit. To me this change came off a little too much like director Tim Burton was trying too hard to make Charlie seem so good compared to the other kids, so he changed the story to make Charlie seem perfect. Now I will say that I've never read the book, and I've heard that the original film changed numerous elements from the book, so maybe the reason Burton's version didn't have the scene was because the book didn't, so I don't know, maybe Burton got it right in the end, either way I would have preferred a little more complexity to Charlie to make his character a little more believable.<br /><br />The sets for this movie were all intricately detailed, from Charlie's family shack that was designed to be leaning as if it could fall over at any time, further illustrating the family's poor lot in life. To the extravagance of Wonka's factory, where each room was visually amazing, without feeling faked by CGI. Director Tim Burton's eye for the unusual and keen attention to detail was evident in his sets, and his strong imagination and storytelling ability was perfect for a movie such as this.<br /><br />Even with good performances, extravagant set pieces, and imaginative storytelling by director Tim Burton, this movie is still only average in my opinion. The parts I liked were entertaining, and the parts I didn't weren't that major, but as a whole the movie just didn't grab me to the point that I felt like it was a great movie. I thought it was good to see once, but I probably would not choose to watch it again.<br /><br />"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" is rated PG for mild language.</p></body></html>

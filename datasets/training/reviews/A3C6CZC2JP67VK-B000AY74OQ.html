This film is as good as Shrek, with humor for little kids and us big kids as well. The penguins are awesome and the lemurs are hilarious! This is a funny and charming movie. Based on the story of Marty played by Chris Rock who longs for life outside of the zoo. However Alex and the rest of Marty's friends enjoy the life of luxury at the zoo. Marty decides to venture outside the zoo. And his friends go after him. Subsequently get caught and is sent away. After that it's gets really interesting.<br /><br />I enjoyed the Lemurs. But, I love the penguins and the fact that they are always so sneaky; they really steal the show from the main characters.<br /><br />This is also a mark of great animated film for both adults and children to enjoy.<br /><br />"The Incredibles", for instance, was a fantastic blend of story, action, character and humor which will continue to delight people of all ages. "Madagascar" has a very funny story, great characters, and a lot of humor. On a couple of occasions, the story was a little slow, but I think all of the other areas more than compensate for any shortcomings. And adults will laugh at many of the jokes, probably more so than the kids in the audience. "Madagascar" again is a really good, very funny film suitable for the entire family.</p></body></html>

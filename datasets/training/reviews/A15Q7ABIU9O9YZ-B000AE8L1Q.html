(Talia Shire) is kind of like Costner, drifting in an alcoholic fugue, the glory days as a Detroit Tiger (Denny McClain?) over, with the horribly emotionally wounded Joan Allen.<br /><br />This movie is reminiscent of the Diane Lane "Under the Tuscan Sun" story several years back. I found "Anger" much more engaging and was frankly bored by "Tuscan Sun."<br /><br />Part of that is due to Allen's brilliance and her ability to do more with what she was given than Lane was. And, frankly, Costner is better now aging than he was before saving the world and being heroic. I liked "For the Love of the Game" and I thought "Open Range" was one of the best westerns ever made.<br /><br />Here we deal with Allen's anger and the impact it has on her four daughters ranging from 15 to I imagine 23-24. Mike Binder knows that anger is like a drug and like a drug it allows us destructive self-pity and the excuse for not changing.<br /><br />Why Allen's husband disappeared is almost irrevelant as her rage is so close to the surface. That rage fuels the first 3/4ths of the movie.<br /><br />Costner plays sort of a sounding board and his accptance by the daughters as a friend-father-figure comes really earlier than his acceptance by Allen as a partner and a friend.<br /><br />My only criticism is that Binder does too much with the issues. The acting talents of the daughters are never really used and they drift from one crisis to another. Allen's 'my life just fell apart so let me be a psycho-witch' becomes tedious and her explosions, while brilliantly acted, causes one to wonder if her husband had the right idea.<br /><br />All of which is a credit to Allen and her own range. Here's a note on Costner. In both "Open Range" and "Anger" he acts a secondary role with brilliant actors (Duvall; Allen) and they draw from him his own deep talent. 4 stars.

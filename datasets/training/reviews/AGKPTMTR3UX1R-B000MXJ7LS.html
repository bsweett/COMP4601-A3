And perhaps WORLD TRADE CENTER is better than it seems. And perhaps the main difficulty with this movie IS that was simply too soon to treat Nine Eleven cinematically. Perhaps, perhaps.<br /><br />But the truth is that this Hollywoodization of America's darkest day is wholly inadequate in addressing its subject matter, despite a sincere attempt by all involved to make a responsible, quality film about the Trade Center disaster.<br /><br />Yes, it touches the event, transmitting about 1/1,000,000,000th of the emotion of the event to the viewer. WORLD TRADE CENTER is well-made, deserving of TWO AND A HALF STARS for good acting and authenticity, but it's focus is too narrow. By reducing itself to the story of a group of miraculously unharmed survivors, it never captures the vastness of the event or the eight million tragedies that crowded that moment in time. Despite the survival of small groups of the buildings' trapped occupants, this should not have been a film with a happy ending.<br /><br />Almost any currently-existing documentary about that day is more effective in speaking to the audience than is this film. (The conspiracy-theory-fueled College Boy film school junk film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016N52IK">Loose Change Final Cut</a> is an exception.)<br /><br />Unfortunately, WORLD TRADE CENTER does not succeed in bringing the event within the compass of our understanding. It may be decades before the media creates such a film. If ever.</p></body></html>

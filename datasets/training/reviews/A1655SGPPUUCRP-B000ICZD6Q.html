<meta name="summary" content=""Sharply written & beautifully nuanced""></head><body><p>Written and directed by Paul Weitz, "In Good Company" is a disarmingly realistic, poignant, and wholeheartedly enjoyable film.  Weitz, the man behind the similarly-themed "About a Boy" and the polar-oppositely-themed "American Pie" films, is a master of blending real-life drama with accessibly comedy.  Though there is a bit too much of an emphasis on the romance between Scarlett Johansson's and Topher Grace's characters, Weitz has an undeniable gift for capturing achingly truthful human behavior in any given situation.  It is this valuable ability that makes "In Good Company" such a beautiful film.<br /><br />This smart, funny and refreshingly honest portrait of two businessmen at different crossroads in their lives, masquerades as a romantic comedy with the distracting romance between Johansson and Grace, but still manages to get its point across in the most pleasant of ways.  It subtly suggests that audiences examine how they set their priorities and live their lives.  Numerous questions popped into my head during throughout the film, ranging from "What is happiness?" and "When are you really happy?" to "What is really important in my life?"  In a darkened theater, it's a reminder of how anemic, routine and emasculated character-driven comedies released by major studios have become because "In Good Company" is anything but anemic, routine and emasculated.<br /><br />Everyone will find a character to identify with.  Are you the middle-aged businessman/family man struggling to balance the two?  Are you the housewife trying to hold your family together while your husband is always working?  Are you the teenage daughter on the brink of womanhood trying to find your identity?  Are you young and ambitious with a troubled past desperately trying to find meaning and purpose in your life?  "In Good Company" is a film that will hit close to home with many; maybe even a bit too close.</p></body></html>

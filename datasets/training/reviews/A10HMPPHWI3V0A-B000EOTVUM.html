BUT after about 45<br /> minutes of nearly falling asleep the movie finnaly<br /> took a sudden and abrupt turn for the better. I<br /> really got a good vibe from this movie, there is<br /> only a handful of movies that actually depect true<br /> horror and this is one of them. Some parts of the<br /> film actually reminded me somewhat of the Australian<br /> "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre". You could really tell<br /> from the picture quality that the film was on a<br /> tight budget but the director really did a nice job<br /> of working around that and putting together an over-<br />all good "Bad Guy" horror film ... not to shabby, not<br /> shabby at all.<br /><br />Grade: B-</p></body></html>

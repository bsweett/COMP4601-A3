The story is absolutely TERRIFIC!<br /><br />Aliens coming to Earth and taking over the planet because according to the aliens, the people living here aren't properly taking care of the planet and letting it fall apart.  The aliens have come back to Earth to preserve its natural beauty and save it from a horrible and unfortunate death by the humans.<br /><br />Interesting the alien that played the lead character (who wasn't dressed in a costume, haha, he was really just a normal person pretending to be an alien for storyline purposes) could speak really good English.  He even had amazing special powers that he'd use to control the human race.<br /><br />I know, it sounds like a tacky storyline going by my description, but believe me, for a science fiction story, it was delivered in a way that was satisfying to me personally because I could *understand* what was going on the entire time, in addition to making it somewhat believable.  Not that I think something like THIS could ever happen, what with aliens coming back to Earth and reclaiming their planet, but well.... you never know!<br /><br />There were some really neat special effects, especially with the swarms of bugs that appeared near the end of the film.  One scene even showed them swarming over a football stadium and making it disappear very quickly as they chewed it away.  GREAT scene.<br /><br />Even scarier was a scene showing the environment turn dark and intimidating as the bugs from way up above in the atmosphere got closer and closer to land.<br /><br />Kathy Bates absolutely RULES in her role (because I love her as an actress so I tend to pay exceptionally close attention to any role she appears in!)<br /><br />My FAVORITE part of the movie was that gigantic creature that came out of the spaceship.  His first appearance was absolutely fantastic in words I can't even describe.  All the cops and special agents around the area were already nervous because a spaceship just landed and these mysterious alien creatures were visiting, and then THIS huge mechanical thing with an orange-colored light shining from his mouth section suddenly appears through the mist, and scans over the entire area with the ability to shut off lights, vehicles, and electronics.<br /><br />I was like "Oh man, what's this huge machine going to do NEXT?? and when he first appeared I was in total shock!"  I loved every appearance with this gigantic robotic creature.  We find out later what the purpose of this thing was, something that caught me by surprise.<br /><br />Supposedly one of the creatures in the film is called Klaatu, but that's like the greatest, most underrated band from the late 70's and I don't recall seeing them perform! (Kidding)<br /><br />Overall, the negative reviews can be angry and hateful all they want- I know what I just enjoyed.</p></body></html>

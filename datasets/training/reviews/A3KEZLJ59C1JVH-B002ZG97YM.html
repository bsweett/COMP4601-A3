I had no intention of watching the whole thing, but after a few minutes, I was hooked! "How to Train Your Dragon" is a wonderful story about a young Viking boy, Hiccup, who never warms to his people's love of fighting and killing dragons. Hiccup eventually encounters and befriends a dragon, who he names Toothless. (And let me tell you, this dragon is adorable...reminds me of my cat for some reason.) Together, Hiccup and Toothless join together to save Hiccup's people from certain doom.<br /><br />This is such a wonderful story about friendship, morality, and about being kind to animals. I really enjoyed it and think it's a movie that all parents should watch with their kids.</p></body></html>

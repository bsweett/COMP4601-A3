I like Robert Crais' novels, but when they get filmed all the life goes out of them and the coincidences seem to assume huge, blatant outlines, as though highlighted by Sharpies.  Bruce Willis is fine as the hostage specialist who burns out after one excruciating standoff during which a child hostage gets killed.  Of course you know that, years later, and still haunted by his failure, and even though he's moved himself miles and miles from any stressful urban situations, somehow he's going to find himself right back in the thick of another, even worse, hostage crisis.  In this kind of picture, that's part of the formula.  "Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!"<br /><br />The problem is that all the children in the movie, and the young people in general, are terrible at acting.  I know there are good young actors out there.  I know this in my heart, just as I know that Rumer Willis is not one of them!  Wooden isn't the word.  She's heroic the same way Sofia Coppola was in The Godfather III.  Rumer plays Bruce's rebellious daughter in this one, not a stretch you might think but she looks like she's suffering the tortures of the damned.  And she spends most of the movie in bondage as it happens, gee thanks Dad.  Yet she's Sarah Bernhardt compared to the three punks who take a suburban mansion hostage, and the brother and sister they imprison.  They are all terrible and nearly ruin the show.  Ben Foster, sometimes very good, here sinks his own career with a series of acting "decisions" which belong in the Clunker Hall of Fame.  If he lives another three or four years, he will look back on this, the folly of his youth, with fists rubbing his eyes, as though he can't believe he was the same person.  A twelve step program might help, but is there one for "Ham Anonymous"?<br /><br />Now all the Ben Foster fanboys and girls will come down on me like the plague Hilary Swank fights in THE REAPING, but the truth is the truth and what Ben Foster does here is an insult to the very reels of film that captured his performance in.<br /><br />It was nice to see Serena Scott Thomas as Bruce Willis's wife.  If her casting follows its usual pattern, they must have offered the script to her sister, Kristin Scott Thomas, who then shuddered and rolled it sideways and sent it whooshing down the pneumatic tube to sister Serena.  Yeah thanks Sis.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Superb acting, average movie"></head><body><p>I thought the acting and the characterization were wonderful. The movie overall was not wonderful, a C+ at best. It had a few funny moments. But it tried too hard to be a Seinfeld episode meets Whalerider meets Terms of Endearment.<br /><br />Also recommended: IN HER SHOES, WHALERIDER, NURSE BETTY, DEAR GOD, or AS GOOD AS IT GETS.</p></body></html>

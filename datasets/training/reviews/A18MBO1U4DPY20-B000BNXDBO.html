<meta name="summary" content="AN AWESOME ENTERTAINING FLICK"></head><body><p>This is one awesome movie. It's about these two asian guys having a bad day and a worse eventful night. They wish to eat burgers at some place called "White Castle" because they saw an advert on tv.There on , its all about their crazy journey. They keep running into wierd people everywhere. I thought the white yuppies were really funny. The best scene in the flick was the one where they actually steal a truck belonging to posers and later sing along to some extremely lame music. I'd recommend this to anyone because it's thoroughly entertaining and funny.<br /><br />I understood the Hindi they spoke at the Indian store and that was a nice feeling.I thought the "Kumar" in the film acted rather well. He was also one of the many supporting actors in "American Desi" which was another funny flick. Harold And Kumar....overtakes all my expectations. I suggest you rent a dvd and try this movie out first before purchasing it.<br /><br />Another must see is a film featuring Tim Robbins and Martin Lawrence called "Nothing To Lose". Meanwhile , while you're at it,please note "Friday" is the funniest of them all.<br /><br />Cheers</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great zombie movie on a better DVD!"></head><body><p>A deadly virus has escaped into a underground scientific colony owned by the Umbrella Corporation killing all the researchers and employees, a lovely woman named "Alice" ( Milla Jocovich) is joined with "Rain" ( Michelle Rodriguez) and a elite commando squad to investigate the mysterious deaths of the workers. They discover that the computer that runs the place has taken over and accidently unleashes hordes of zombies & mutant monsters, they must find a way out or else end up as dinner before the virus will infect humanity.<br /><br />A well made adapation of my all time favorite video game series of the same name, sure it doesn't have Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine ( whom stars in part 2) but it's a breezy ride loaded with gore, horror, sci-fi, decent acting, cool music score and a twist in the end that leads to "Resident Evil Apocalypse" which was almost even better.<br /><br />The DVD here has great picture with good sound quality and neat extras like 2 commentaries, featurettes, trailers, and clip from "Resident Evil Apocalypse", so if you enjoy zombie movies then this is definitely worth adding to the zombie DVD collection.<br /><br />Also recommended: " Dawn of the Dead" ( 1978) "Day of the Dead" ,"From Dusk Till Dawn", " The Matrix", "Blade 1 & 2", " Re-Animator", " Cemetery Man", " Total Recall", " Versus", " 28 Days Later...", "Night of the Living Dead ( 1968 and 1990 versions)", " The Stuff", " Scanners", " Hell of the Living Dead ( a.k.a.

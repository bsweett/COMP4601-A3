<meta name="summary" content="Great Adaption"></head><body><p>There's been quite a few adaptions of C.S. Lewis' book "The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe" made. There was a cartoon movie, there was a British TV serial, and now there is a big budget movie, the first in a series of Narnia films. I was very excited when I heard they were doing this, since I'm a very big C.S. Lewis fan. Apart from a couple of very minor hiccups, it was a very fine film indeed.<br /><br />Due to the War the four Pensevie children, Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy are sent into the country, where they will be looked after by Professor Kirke. Kirke lives in a rather large house, so there's plenty of places for hide and seek. During on of their games, little Lucy stumbles upon a world within a wardrobe, a world full of talking animals, fauns, nymphs, dwarves and driads, a world where it is always winter and never Christmas thanks to a White Witch named Jadis. Under her reign, Narnia is miserable and oppressed, but there are rumours among the talking animals that Aslan the lion, Narnia's true king, is on the move and that a prophecy is due to be fulfilled.<br /><br />First of all, I've got to say that I'm glad the producers started the series with "The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe" rather than "The Magician's Nephew", which as a book worked better as a prequel than as an introduction to Narnia. There's been a lot of fantasies based on books lately, so I'm sure there have been a lot of comparisons to the "Harry Potter" and "Lord of the Rings" film franchises. I've seen most of both of those film series, and I personally like this Narnia film just a bit better than both of them. The plot is fuller and better flowing than the "Harry Potter" films (which I'd be totally lost on without the books, and much more fun and colourful than the "Lord of the Rings".<br /><br />The kids are well cast, they look as I'd imagined them to in the books, more or less. They also look like they care about each other very much, which really helps the emotion and family side of the messages in the film. The White Witch is also played very well. Just like Edmund, you could mistake her for a motherly figure to begin with, but just watch the emptiness in her eyes. Brilliant! The effects are you're typical 2000s blend of computer graphics, prosthetics and blue screen, but they do the job well enough.<br /><br />J.R.R. Tolkien, though a good friend of C.S. Lewis', was never a big fan of the Narnia series. He just couldn't get his head around the fact that all these elements of various mythologies and cultures (fauns, dryads, Father Christmas, etc) were sharing the same imaginary place. Though I think Tolkien was being a little obsessive there (they're just imaginary creatures, J.), he does have a little bit of a point. It must have been a task for the design team of the film to have everything gel together, but they manage to succeed I thought. Narnia's Father Christmas, for instance, is no Santa stereotype in the film. He wears a subdued red-brown suit, is fairly trim, and though he's grey and bearded still has a tinge of red to his hair. Though he chuckles, he never once says "ho ho ho!", and he never once introduces himself by name. This is a Father Christmas that fits in very well with Narnia, I thought.<br /><br />C.S. Lewis was fascinated with both the works of creation around him, and those moments in life where they looked or felt or tasted spectacular. He used to describe them as "the joy". Though the beautiful scenery is mostly in the background, I think director Andrew Adamson had some idea of this, just by the way he sets up some of the shots. As a modern fantasy film, it is rather atmospheric compared to some of its contemporaries, whose plots and scenery just whiz by with no time to smell the flowers. Good job.<br /><br />C.S. Lewis was a devoted and intellegent Christian, and through the plot you can see that (Aslan is like Jesus, who has to die for Edmund's mistakes just like Jesus had to die for ours, etc). In the film, I notice a couple of visual themes had been added. The crossing and falling into the river reminded me a little of baptism for instance.<br /><br />There have been a couple of diversions from the book, some good, some not so good I say. I liked the World War II intro and the 1940s music while the kids play hide and seek, it gave the children's world a little more context which C.S. Lewis (writing in the early 1950s) would have most probably taken for granted. I didn't really appreciate the Hollywood-ness of the wolves. C.S. Lewis (just like Tolkien) was very particular about the words he used, and I don't know what he would have thought about some of the almost action movie villain lines the wolves have. Still, it's really only a minor point, that one.<br /><br />Special features on this version of the DVD include two audio commentaries from the crew and a blooper reel. In this bloopers everyone looks like they were having lots of fun, which is always a good sign. There's also a Narnia "Fun Facts" option, introduced by a relative of C.S. Lewis. When you turn the fun facts on during the film, they pop up, telling you bits and pieces about the making of the film, elements of the story and about the author C.S. Lewis. I'm a pretty avid C.S. Lewis fan, of both his life and his works, but I did actually learn some things. I had never made the connection that he died the same day as President Kennedy. 22nd of November 1963, honestly, that day gets stranger and stranger the more I hear about it...<br /><br />Anyway, I say its a good family film, a great fantasy, great primer for the rest of the series, and though it's not 100% to the book, it's good enough for me. However, I am very much hoping that they do the last half of "Voyage of the Dawn Treader" and the end of "The Last Battle" (my favorite bits of the series) exactly by the book, since they're such vivid and beautiful pieces of writing.</p></body></html>

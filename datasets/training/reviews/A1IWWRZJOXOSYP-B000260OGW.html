We came out of the theatre with the same word on our lips: Oscar!  The landscape of the film is stark, the pacing of the moving is deliberate, and the characters are unadorned.  All of this serves to create a sense of reality for the film that sucks the viewer into the film and swoops them up into the world of Bluebonnet Spearman, Charley Waite & Sue Barlow.  The climactic fight scene is breathtaking.  An entire fight sequence occurs without music, making it all the more real.  Costner allows us to know where everyone is, who gets shot & why.  "Open Range" is an amazing achievement and shows Costner to be one of our best working directors.  The 2-disc DVD is a treature.<br /><br />The acting is superb.  As Charley Waite, Costner's performance is understated, brilliantly focused on detail.  Costner was nominated for Best Actor for "Dances With Wolves," the year he won the Oscar as its best director.  The scene where he tracks mud into Sue Barlow's house, tries to scoop the clumps into his hat & with a glance to see if he's watched, picks up the carpet and brushes the last little bits to be unseen is a magical moment, wordless & profound.<br /><br />Robert Duvall is certainly one of our most recognized actors with an Oscar for "Tender Mercies" in 1983 & five other acting nominations ("The Godfather," "Apocalypse Now," "The Great Santini," "The Apostle," & "A Civil Action.")  I certainly thought his portrayal of Boss (Bluebonnet) Spearman was going to bring home a second statue.  Duvall's character is understated, but with depth and grace.<br /><br />Annette Bening as Sue Barlow also turns in a stellar performance as the hard working sister of the doctor who is just a bit past her prime, still not willing to settle for just any man, but who sees the goodness in Charley Waite.  I found the romantic conclusion to be the perfect ending to the film.<br /><br />The villain Baxter played by Michael Gambon is dastardly.  The deleted scene where he shoots the bartender Bill for not picking up a gun is so evil.  It's hard to reconcile that the same actor can then do such a magical job as Aldus Dumbledore in "Harry Potter & the Prisoner of Azkaban."  Abraham Benrubi as the burly Mose whose death precipitates the action does a great job as a modern Hoss Cartwright.  Diego Luna as Buttons turns in an excellent performance as the young cowhand Buttons.  I did not recognize him from "Frida" or "The Terminal."  Also, Dean McDermott gives a great reading as Doc Barlow.<br /><br />Perhaps special recognition must be given Michael Jeter who plays the jumpy stable attendant Percy who befriends Charly & Boss.  Perched atop the barn, he gives them clues throughout the fight to where the bad guys are.  The Emmy-winning actor for his work in "Evening Shade" TV series passed away from complications associated with AIDS.  This was his last onscreen role followed by a voice appearance in "The Polar Express."<br /><br />"Open Range" is an excellent film.  The DVD offers many extras with the deleted scenes being my favorite.  Bravo!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Coen Brothers At Their Best"></head><body><p>Other than Rasing Arizona & The Big Lebowski I never been a Coen Brothers fan as I think they are highly over rated. After seeing the abysmall The Ladykillers I vowed never to see another Coen Brothers film, however due to all the postive buzz I decided to give No Country For Old Men a try and I was impressed. Josh Brolin who deserved a Oscar nod for his role in Amercian Gangster shines as Llewelyn Moss as a vietnam veteran who stumbles upon the aftermath of a drugs deal gone wrong in the desert. Watching the film made me recall various Greek tradegy that I read in high school, espically when Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh comes into play. The purusut of Llewlyn by Anton is a nail biting cat & mouse that kept my attention. I think the film deserved all the Oscars it won and I'd love to see what Javier Bardem can do in a big budget action film as a dirty cop. All in all a great film that will get repeated viewings from me.</p></body></html>

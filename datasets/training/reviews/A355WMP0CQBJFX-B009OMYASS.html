<meta name="summary" content="DISGUSTING + PSYCHOTIC = GOOD!!"></head><body><p>need i say more. if you've seen this movie you know what i mean, if you haven't that says it all. that's what happens in those crazy countries, where they got all this underground stuff going on. if you're a tourist you better watch out. it's there house, and you're just a visitor. overall this movie was good. three unsuspecting guys who think they're in for some fun...turns out to be their worst nightmare. there's no escape, and no bodies on your side. there's torture, blood, and gory stuff. makes you kind of flinch and glad it isn't you. i think they managed to do what they set out to do which was make you feel disgusted, and glad you're home. nice job, and jay was pretty good too. i do recommend if this kind of stuff is you're thing.</p></body></html>

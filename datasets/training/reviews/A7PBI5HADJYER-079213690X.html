Gibson's second directorial attempt is a towering achievement, with the bloody battle sequences and rousing speeches standing out.  Other outstanding accomplishments: James Horner's score is superb, Mel Gibson gives a powerful performance, and Catherine McCormack and Sophie Marceau are gorgeous beauties. A stirring epic that works on every level it aspires.</p></body></html>

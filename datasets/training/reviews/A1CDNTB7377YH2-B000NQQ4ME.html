<meta name="summary" content="Old Story, New Setting"></head><body><p>Interesting setting for a story that is not new.  This time using a village of Mayas about the time of the Spanish arrival to, I am assuming, Mexico (Cancun perhaps?).  The peaceful village where everybody seems to be happy and where the men have hunted for generations, get their first inkling of trouble when a beraggled group of other Mayans seem anxious to get across the hunting grounds of the village.  Apparently they are fleeing from some unknown fierce enemy.<br /><br />That night as the village sleeps they are overrun by a band of outlaws who kill all who resist and truss up all others.  The main character of the village (they don't seem to have any names though one of the bad guys calls him "Almost") hides his pregnant wife in a deep hole along with his son.  He promises her he will be back to get them but is immediately captured by the baddies himself.<br /><br />The villagers are forced to march tied up.  The leader of the bad guys doesn't want any of them killed so the audience figures they are going to be sold into slavery.  As it turns out some will be sold as slaves while others will be sacrificed.<br /><br />When the main character escapes he is pursued by a horde of bad guys intent on killing him.  It is up to him to stay alive long enough and get back to where he left his wife and child before the oncoming rain will drown them.<br /><br />Why this is not a new tale, is because the way he is chased by the bad guys and how he deals with them, has been seen in many action flicks in the past.<br /><br />The movie is a good action tale and the use of subtitles is no problem.  Not quite five stars but pretty good.</p></body></html>

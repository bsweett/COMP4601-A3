<meta name="summary" content="Michael Medved is an Idiot!"></head><body><p>Don't read any more of this review if you intend to see Million Dollar Baby and don't know what the story is about. Assisted suicide is a key part of the story  -- one character who, despite his strong Catholic faith, decides to help another character, doomed to life as a quadrapeligic, end her life. I seriously doubt that Clint Eastwood, a lifelong conservative Republican, is making a political statement with Million Dollar Baby. But that didn't stop the right wing, in the person of Michael Medved, in trashing the film's supposed advocacy of assisted suicide. Thankfully voices of sanity like Roger Ebert rose up in defense of the film, rightfully claiming that the film wasn't making a political statement. The character that assists in the suicide does not do so lightly and only arrives at his decision after much self-searching.<br /><br />I'm tired of right wing robots like Michael Medved who yell about liberal bias in the media one moment but then think it's all right to let their own personal extremist conservative agenda color everything they watch on TV or at the movies. Clint Eastwood has made a humane and compassionate film that uses assisted suicide as a plot resolution, not a political statement. To reduce this film, which richly deserved the Best Picture Academy award, to a "cause film" is just wrong. I'm sick and tired of Michael Medved's right wing garbage. If you haven't seen Million Dollar Baby, don't let Medved stop you from doing so. If you have seen it, please don't let Medved's ignorance and stupidity change your view of it -- he is a smug, hypocritical, right wing shill who has squandered any credibility he might have had by making such a stupid statement about such a great film.</p></body></html>

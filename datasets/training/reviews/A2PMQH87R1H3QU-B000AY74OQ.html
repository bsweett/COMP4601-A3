<meta name="summary" content="YA WAS FUNNY,BUT NOT BUYING THIS DVD VERSION!!!!"></head><body><p>Ya I loved this movie, was laugh out funny and real enjoy it. But if u are a DVD collector like I am.  Wait for few months I am very sure they going to comes out with DOUBLE DISK or 3D or something better an this single simple disk!!  Like these studies DOUBLEDIP us these days with there B.S And suck up more money from us, Because of the popularity of these animations DVDS like "SHREK" or most others DVDS, if u want to real see it just rent it  & wait for another version of this  DVD later on for your DVD collection , Defiantly skip this one!!! I guess better an be safe then sorry!</p></body></html>

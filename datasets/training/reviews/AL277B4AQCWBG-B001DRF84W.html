Unlike so many comic-book adaptations, Ang Lee's "Hulk" aims for - and brilliantly achieves - another kind of realism: the emotional kind. James Schamus (surely the most under-appreciated champion of quality American films) has penned a superb story which ensures this isn't just another disposable summer film doing the groundwork for a franchise. It's actually ABOUT something: fatherhood, and the legacy we leave our children. Embracing both the Oedipal subtext and the need for thrilling action, Ang Lee, with typical confidence and subtlety, has delivered a film which is both stunningly entertaining and more than a little moving. The trailers hyped the digital effects, but there's so much more here to be enjoyed. Indeed, the trailers gave away absolutely nothing of Act 3 which includes a climactic performance from Nick Nolte which is nothing short of Oscar-worthy. Innovative cinematography and editing are intelligently applied and, as always, Danny Elfman's thrilling score is a perfect match. "Hulk" is a film that can and should be enjoyed again and again - it's subtle, intelligent and above all interesting. What a refreshing change for Hollywood. Teen boys disappointed their expectations weren't met should take a second look at this in twenty years' time - when they're fathers.</p></body></html>

The digital transfer to DVD is awful; the "FOG" is nothing but Pixels. As for being a frightening, creepy or even slightly scary film it falls on its face. There is nothing at all thrilling about this boring remake. Its disappointing that this cast was given such a vehicle of banality to act in, we all have seen these people shine in other roles. The Original, as many have pointed out before, is dripping in creepiness and still to this day resonates in my mind every time I am passed by a wisp of fog.  What Hollywood fails to realize with all these thinned out remakes is that the original films were rooted in the times, the mood of society, the innocence of this country and the untapped talents of up and coming directors and writers who have since become jaded and bored.</p></body></html>

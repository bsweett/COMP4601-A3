<meta name="summary" content="A Brilliant Haunted House Film (but the Dialogue is Extremely Soft)"></head><body><p>Luckily I saved my VHS tape which has normal, evenly recorded dialogue and music and effects. I can't watch the dvd any longer because of the awful audio. The character's lines are incredibly faint and soft.<br />I wonder if they do it on purpose with some dvd's, making the dialogue so quiet that you need to crank your tv volume up a great deal. Then comes a deafening sound effect (or part of the film score, or a scream, etc) and it shakes the house.<br /><br />That one negative being said, this is one of my favorite old fashioned, haunted house films. It is genuinely frightening. And the scares aren't cheap tricks or gimmicks that we've become used to from Hollywood. This film is a refreshing change from the usual junk that calls itself a horror movie but never really gets under your skin or genuinely creeps you out.<br /><br />The atmosphere, acting, script, cinematography, score, and direction are wonderful. If you like brilliant, creepy ghost movies like The Innocents, The Changeling, and The Haunting (1963), then this is for you. Watch it at night in total darkness. I dare you.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Excellent film adaptation of Dan Brown's book!"></head><body><p>Excellent film adaptation of Brown's book that loses none of the suspense and does an excellent job in the two hours it spans.  I disagree with a lot of the critics that complain about the faithfulness to the book.  All the key points are covered and quite well in the time allotted.  Tom Hanks does an excellent job as Robert Landon, who seems to be mysteriously blamed for the murder of a curator in the Paris Louvre art museum.  He is relentlessly hunted by the police like the recent Jason Bourne movies and seems to escape by the skin of his teeth or through sheer luck.<br /><br />The movie makes clear that there is no church cover-up and the only people after Langdon and Sofie are fanatics under the direction of the mysterious "Teacher."</p></body></html>

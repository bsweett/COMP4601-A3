<meta name="summary" content="Comic Book Treatment!"></head><body><p>This was a juvenile, comic-book treatment of one of the most accomplished leaders in recorded history.  From the repeated gore of battles to the ridiculous sounding of Greek names, everything about this movie was poorly done . . just plain inane.<br /><br />Implying that his mother had a hand in the murder of his father, and that Alexander took his own life after the death of his friend and lover was ridiculously speculative and made no sense.  The insistence that he  felt a mission to be "politically correct" in his dealings with those he conquered was far from historically accurate.  He wanted to Hellenize the world, but that didn't mean that he thought that the Greeks were any less than the most civilized people on Earth.<br /><br />When he continually referred to his actions in the "known world" one has to wonder why he would use this term . . unless he knew of the existence of some "unknown world."  We can look back and realize that the Greeks had no knowledge of the Chinese or American or other distant civilizations but he didn't know that.<br /><br />All in all, it was 2-1/2 hours too long.</p></body></html>

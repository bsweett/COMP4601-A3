<meta name="summary" content="Bourne Supremacy: An Excellent High Speed Nitroglycerin Trip"></head><body><p>A deal is going down in Berlin, Germany.  The CIA is buying confidential Russian information in regards to a mole within the CIA.  Everything goes as planned as the CIA operatives are listening to each word and have a visual of the agent with the money.  Suddenly the light goes off and the mission has disastrous consequences.  When the CIA searches the crime scene for evidence they find a fingerprint that leads them to CIA headquarters and to identify the individual one most have clearance from the highest authority.<br /><br />Thousands of miles away Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) has withdrawn from a public life with his girlfriend, Marie (Franka Potente), to the beaches of Goa, India.  Jason struggles with amnesia, but bits and pieces return to him in the form of fragmented nightmares and dreams.  These fragments seem to be clues about his past and what he has done, and he continuously records his dreams in a notebook.  When Jason returns from one of his routine exercise bouts he notices a man that sticks out in the crowd, which initiates a deadly hunt on Bourne.<br /><br />The cinematography in Bourne Supremacy is brilliant as it moves swiftly using unusual camera angles which generates a feeling of stress and panic. Despite this panicky atmosphere Jason Bourne moves with a directness that resembles a champion prize fighter before a fight.  This displays Matt Damon's good performance in the film where he takes care of business as some do when they pick up the mail form the mailbox.  The editing of Bourne Supremacy is excellent as there are many rapid cuts and jumps from different camera angles, similar to a comic book.  Regardless of being similar to a comic book or not, the editing works its magic as it turns up the tension and produces a highly suspenseful atmosphere.  When the story comes together under the direction of Greengrass the audience has experienced a top notch action thriller that will keep the viewers on the edge from beginning to end.</p></body></html>

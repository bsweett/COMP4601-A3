Then he grew up and turned his talent to serious filmmaking, and he gave us Lorenzo's Oil. You'd not be stretching much by tagging either with the word "classic." Then he disappeared for a while. He resurfaced and wrote two of the best kids' films of the past decade in Babe and its sequel, Pig in the City. Then, once again, he disappeared from sight. Is it wrong to have assumed, given George Miller's track record, that he would once again emerge with something sterling?<br /><br />Instead, we got Happy Feet, a confused mess of a movie that joins the junk heap of worthless 2006 kids' movies, the largest pile of them in recent memory. Even Pixar couldn't come up with something that rose above mediocre in 2006. George Miller should have been a savior. Instead, we got Happy Feet.<br /><br />For its first fifteen minutes, this movie wants to be a subject-less musical with well-rendered, but age-inappropriate and badly-covered, pop tunes. This is not necessarily a horrible thing; any parent who spends an hour listening to Satan's mouthpiece on Earth, Radio Disney, will be greatly surprised at the number of songs s/he recognizes (and despairs at how awfully they've been rendered by the current generation of child TV stars). I was prepared for bad child-star renderings of previously popular songs. As a result, the first fifteen minutes of the movie were its most enjoyable. Had it stayed on that track, it would have worked.<br /><br />Then, however, it became a coming-of-age tale with assorted bad musical numbers. Mumble (Elijah Wood) is a penguin who can't sing. (Whether any of the others can is open to debate, but you have to accept it for the premise. Note that, ironically, the only professional singer in the cast who plays an Emperor penguin plays Mumble as a baby.) He expresses his musical gift in another way-- he can dance. Noah (Hugo Weaving), the tribe elder, is convinced that Mumble, being different, is evil, and should be cast out of the tribe. But he doesn't need to be cast out; the other penguins do a fine job of marginalizing him. (Don't worry, this is the subtle message in the movie.) Mumble wanders off on his own and finds another tribe of penguins. Ramon, his first contact with the tribe, and Lovelace, their spiritual leader, are both voiced by Robin Williams. (That nothing has yet been said about Robin Williams' awful hispanic accent and the stereotyping of the "lazy Mexican" in this penguin tribe is somewhat confounding.) After some clashes with Noah and the setup of a love-story subplot with Mumble's childhood friend Gloria (Brittany Murphy), we get into the third direction this movie wants to pull us, which anyone who's seen any kids' movie since FernGully should be all too familiar with: the idea that every time a human being sets foot outside his environmentally-destructive door, he will cause further irreparable harm to the environment, leading to the imminent destruction of the entire planet unless we DO SOMETHING RIGHT NOW.<br /><br />Frankly, it's not just getting old, it was already old when FernGully came out. Worse, it's the most obvious, braindead form of inculcation possible, and we allow our children to wallow in it without us ever questioning it. It's gotten to the point where "oh, boy, another kids' movie!" equates with "oh, boy, another vicious attack on humanity's inability to live in harmony with the environment!" It's pathetic and disgusting. Even if Happy Feet had been an otherwise brilliant movie, the braindead pandering in the final third of its length would have knocked a couple of stars off its rating. But it's not an otherwise brilliant movie. It's a confused, needlessly complex mess that could have been a pretty decent-- at best-- musical. Instead, it's one of the worst films I have personally experienced in 2006, and I attribute this only to the fact that I was successfully able to avoid seeing both Madea's Family Reunion and the Larry the Cable Guy movie. *</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Friendship and Hardship"></head><body><p>Based upon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060734019">the award-winning book</a> by Katherine Paterson, Bridge to Terabithia is a touching film about the bond between two children, both of them outcasts, who learn the importance of friendship and the power of imagination. The screenplay was written by Jeff Stockwell and co-written by David Paterson, the author's son, so the film remains quite faithful to the spirit of the book. The director, Gabor Csupo, handles the emotionally charged story with skill and sensitivity, which only heightens the impact of the events therein.<br /><br />Jess Aarons has two passions in life: drawing and running. He draws so that he can escape into a world of his own, so that he can escape the demands of his stern father and constant harassment from his sisters, and the bullying he endures at school. He runs because he wants to be the fastest boy at his school, which in his eyes is the only way to win the respect of his peers and his father. But his dream of being the fastest runner is dashed to pieces when his new next-door neighbor, Leslie Burke, beats him in the race on the first day of school. At first, Jess holds a grudge against Leslie. That changes when he discovers her free-spirited nature, which earns her the reputation of being weird. Together, Jess and Leslie create an imaginary world where they can be themselves without fear of social ostracization. They become the closest of friends and they look out for one another. Still, their friendship differences sometimes cause conflict. Jess' family is large and is struggling financially, while Leslie's family comprises only of her parents and her and they are wealthy, and Jess' family goes to church, but Leslie's doesn't. In spite of these differences their mutual respect and admiration blossoms into innocent, unconditional love. However this time of happiness is intruded upon by a horrible accident, which leaves Jess angry and questioning his faith. He is ultimately strengthened by his friendship with Leslie, and he begins to reach out to other people, even those that he never would have before.<br /><br />It's unfortunate, but when Walt Disney Studios and Walden media advertised this film, they presented it as being a fantasy/adventure film. This is hardly the case. Bridge to Terabithia is a family film about the problems of life and the inevitable and painful lessons we have to learn in order to grow. It's a film about childhood innocence and the loss of that innocence, as we mature into adulthood. But most importantly, the film is about letting your imagination carry you away from your troubles just long enough for you to find the solutions, and about letting your love free you from your fears. Bridge to Terabithia is a film that will move its viewers, both the young and the young at heart.<br />The story is propelled by the talented cast, especially Josh Hutcherson as Jess, AnnaSophia Robb as Leslie, Robert Patrick as Josh's father, Jack and Zooey Deschanel as Josh's teacher, Ms. Edmunds (whose beautifully emotive blue eyes illuminate the screen in every scene she's in).<br /><br />The DVD includes these bonus features: Digital Imagination featurette, Behind the Scenes featurette, Keep Your Mind Wide Open music video by AnnaSophia Robb, two audio commentaries with cast and crew, and previews.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800177991">My Girl</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JG6M">The Indian in the Cupboard</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LK94">Fly Away Home</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305428247">The Mighty</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005B4BI">Pay it Forward</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLYQ">Holes</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E8M0WO">The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EDOC5Q">The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NA6CPE">Charlotte's Web</a></p></body></html>

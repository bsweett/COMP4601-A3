<meta name="summary" content="Ugly Americans Get What's Coming to Them"></head><body><p>Sometimes a B-movie can say more than an A-lister. Example - I am avoiding Munich, because I simply don't care to see a two hour sermon on why violence begats violence and how revenge can get so far out of hand, that it stops being about revenge and only leads to brutality. On the other hand, bring over the latest J-Horror movie about vengeful ghosts, or the latest Korean horror movie with the same theme and I'm totally watching it with you.<br /><br />I know that some are confused about the sudden tone shift in this movie (similar to the one in From Dusk til Dawn - the other Tarantino-associated movie with divisive audiences) but that sudden tone shift is not quite so sudden. In both the opening sequences in Amsterdam and the ending sequences in Slovokia, there's an undercurrent of desperation that the American tourists just DON'T GET. Everyone from the hookers of Amsterdam, the dealers of the clubs, the femme fatales of the hostel and the little kids that want candy and will beat you if you don't give it is taking part in a brutal post-Soviet economy that only The Lord of War (which SHOULD have been this successful but wasn't) touched on with similar honesty.<br /><br />These characters have been compared to the characters in Eurotrip, but the Eurotrip characters are playing it for laughs. You can't compare them to the "reality" stars of Real Cancun since these guys are at least moderately introspective. The best template for this movie would be the 2 minute sequence in Rules of Attraction where a character consumes all over Europe with the smug indifference of a guy treating the entire continent like his fast food place.<br /><br />Eli Roth is a genius in depicting these characters as sleazy but likeable in the first half of the movie. Even the Icelandic character has his moments of decency. They are just likeable enough that you don't want to see them tortured. The second half of the movie becomes an exhilarating exercise in excess, as one-by-one the characters encounter the ultimate institution for tourists with money meeting Eastern Europeans that will do anything for money. The evil kids that wander through the streets brutalizing tourists that won't give them candy or cigarettes (and what they do for a big bag of candy comes at the final reel - yeesh) provide this weird counterpoint to the main action.<br /><br /> I almost think that the Japanese tourists are thrown in to throw down the gauntlet in challenging the superior Asian horror (both Korean and Japanese). If Old Boy ever gets remade into an American movie, only Eli Roth deserves to direct it.<br /><br />So if you don't like movies where people get their fingers cut off, then this isn't for you. If you do like horror movies, definitely watch this thing. It's amazing.</p></body></html>

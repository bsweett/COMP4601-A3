<meta name="summary" content="entertaining movie but this version of DVD is lame"></head><body><p>Don't bother buying this version of the DVD as all you get is two versions of the movie--the theatrical release and unrated version. There are zero extras.<br /><br />Having said that it's an entertaining thriller in which Mel Gibson...oops, I thought ALL movies where the dad gets angry and seeks revenge as a one-man team by himself starred Mel...it's Liam Neeson in this one.<br /><br />Huge plot holes and improbable one man vs. everyone where (it's Hollywood, 'natch) all he suffers is a hurt wing in the entire movie but takes out approximately 9,555 Albanian (yes, Albanian!) criminals in Paris (yes, set that movie in a foreign locale to boost that overseas box office).<br /><br />The dumbest plot device (or non-device) is the fact we are introduced to his three other ex-CIA buddies who now work security for a pop singer. Now, to me, rather than going it alone to Paris given he has only 96 hours to save his daughter from a life of white slavery, he only enlists one guy to do some research on the criminals who may be involved with the kidnapping of his daughter. You don't think these guys would take 96 hours out of their lives to help their buddy, if asked?<br /><br />I just didn't get that. Why introduce these guys as his friends and have them bond at a backyard barbecue then on a job working security, then say bye bye. Did they not have enough in the budget to pay them all to fly to Paris?<br /><br />Anyway, there are some cringe-inducing drugged out scenes of horror as young girls are forced into prostitution so fair warning those who don't dig needles, disgusting room conditions and the whole world of human trafficking. Other than that plenty of bad guy fu, explosions-a-go-go and all around non-stop action.</p></body></html>

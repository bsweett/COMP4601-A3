<meta name="summary" content="Way too ambitious but it works , is it horror or real life ?"></head><body><p>I think BUBBA HO TEP is a serious film pretending to be a comedy / horror film .<br /><br />Without being silly about it , the film is all about the danger of people's souls being lost . That can have a double meaning after seeing the film .<br /><br />It will also confront you if you are in the mood , as getting old is a major plot point and something most of us don't like to think about - it's like we think getting old happens to other people .<br /><br />It has a clever story and acting that makes you take that story at face value . Don't let the weird plot stop you from seeing this great film !</p></body></html>

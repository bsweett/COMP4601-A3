<meta name="summary" content="Burton explores the role of the story-teller in a tall tale of his own."></head><body><p>This film is essentially about story-telling. If you keep this in mind as you watch the film, it offers an interesting contrast between the story-telling of an elderly Alabama businessman, Ed Bloom, and the storytelling of the film's director, Tim Burton.<br /><br />Ed Bloom, played by Ewan McGregor in his youth and by Albert Finney in his old age, is a natural story-teller.  He takes the raw material of everyday life and enhances it, embellishes it, and pulls it together in an entertaining whole. Because his life had several odd twists and turns, he has more raw material for his stories than the average fellow.  His courtship of his wife Sandra, played by Alison Lohman in her youth and by Jessica Lange in her maturity, comprises the most romantic and the longest tale in the story.<br /><br />Ed and Sandra have a son, Will, played by Billy Crudup, who has heard one tall tale too many and has become estranged from his father for the last 3 years while Will and his young wife live in Paris. The story moves from the vastly romantic courtship of Ed and Sandra to Will's stuggle with the relationship with his father. Basically Will assumes that if the stories are embellishments of truth that he does not really know his father. As his father is dying of cancer, Will tries to break through and find the real father underlying the tall tales. His father is insulted and hurt by this approach, and through his sick-bed story telling Ed captivates Will's beautiful young French wife.<br /><br />At the end of the film, the son Will, is left alone with his father as his father is dying and tells his father a tall tale of his father's death, surrounded by all those who have know and loved him, as he becomes a giant black catfish who swims away. At the end we see the son Will finally recognize that the tall tale, the embellished story, contains an essential truth that must be protected and clothed and escorted with the trapings of fantasy so as to be recognized, appreciated, and absorbed.<br /><br />This is the truth that Burton wishes for us to comprehend about the role of the storyteller and he relays this message in his own tall tale.<br /><br />As a final note, since I am from Alabama, I personnally enjoyed seeing the scenes that were filmed in old downtown Montgomery and on the Huntingdon College Campus.</p></body></html>

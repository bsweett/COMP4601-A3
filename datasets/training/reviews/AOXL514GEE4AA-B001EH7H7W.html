I have read the graphic novel and found that the only real similarities are the characters. The movie is fun and enjoyable. Someone said this is a family flick? Ummm, no. Unless everyone in the house is 13 or older. Don't expect to much and you will have a blast!<br /><br />NOW MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: It looks better and sounds better! However, they did not carry over any of the special features or very few of them. Only worth an upgrade to the hardcore fan. FINAL VERDICT: NOT UPGRADE WORTHY.</p></body></html>

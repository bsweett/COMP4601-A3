It certainly does give you a whole new vision of the death penalty, and life in general.  What is truly amazing about this film is the casting!  They should have given an Oscar to all of them as the most outstanding ensemble cast in years!  It's hard to single out any one person, but if you look at the entire cast, you can see how perfect they were for their roles. Of course, Tom Hanks demonstrates why he's considered the best actor out there these days.  His portrayal of Paul Edgecomb is simply terrific.  His battle with the urinary tract infection is played marvelously, without one word of dialogue, and when he's cured, and goes to the john, the look of relief is something any male can identify with.  Truly, an astounding performance.  His face never fails to mesmerize, as he anchors this truly touching story.  His relationship with his wife (beautifully embodied by Bonnie Hunt) is so beautiful; it's rare to see in movies these days. Michael Clarke Duncan was certainly robbed by Michael Caine of his supporting actor Oscar.  Duncan is great.  A man of unbelievable size, he still evokes a gentleness and understanding of love in such a wonderful way.  His last scene with Hanks is pure gold. The rest of the cast is awesome, too.  David Morse (from &quot;St. Elsehwere&quot;) is perfect as Brutal.  All the guards seem to have a genuine love for each other, and Morse displays strength, compassion and humor in this overlooked role.  Jeffrey DeMunn and Barry Pepper as the other &quot;good&quot; guards are brilliant, too. That brings us to Doug Hutchison as Percy, perhaps the most evil and unlikeable character to ever touch celluloid.  Hutchison is brilliant in his portrayal of this evil, uncaring, unhuman guard.  What he does to Delacort in the electrocution scene is the most cold-blooded murder ever witnessed by this reviewer.  You need a strong stomach to sit through this horrible event.  Michael Jeter as Delacort, the man who gets an unusual friend in the mouse, Mr. Jingles, is awesome in his role.  Likewise, Graham Greene, only on screen for a few minutes, creates an indelible death row victim.  And it doesn't stop there: James Cromwell as the warden; Patricia Clarkson, as his dying wife; Harry Dean Stanton as the surrogate victim; Sam Rockwell as the totally irreprehensible Billy Wharton; Gary Sinise in a bit part; and of course Bonnie Hunt as Hanks' wife round out one of the best casts I've seen in years. The Green Mile is one of those movies that sticks in your mind long after you've viewed it; and I almost forgot:  Darabont's brilliant decision to cast veterans Dabbs Greer and Eve Brent as the older Hanks and his nursing home confidant.  Stunning! The movie never seemed slow, or long; it's hypnotic!  It's true film-making at its best. TEN STARS IF WE HAD THEM!!!!</p></body></html>

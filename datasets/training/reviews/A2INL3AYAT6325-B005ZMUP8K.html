<meta name="summary" content="Enjoyable film, not quite as good as the 1st-HORRIBLE DVD PACKAGE"></head><body><p>I enjoyed the film.  Critics did not like it.  Yes, it was too long.  So was the first film.<br /><br />Not quite as good as the first one.<br /><br />Missing were any mention of things in the actual Disneyland attraction. Hearing the song would have been nice like they did in the first film.<br /><br />A COMPLAINT I KEEP MENTIONING MORE & MORE ON DVD PACKAGES & THE MAKERS ARE NOT PAYING ANY ATTENTION-THESE HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE PACKAGES WITH THE LITTLE FLIP OPEN PARTS.  I HATE THEM!!  THEY ARE USELESS!!<br /><br />And, a technical error on this disc, just like when playing the DVD for "Cars".  If you see the subtitles for the hearing impaired.  The subtitles are NOT correct in several areas.  They omit words from the script the actors are saying.</p></body></html>

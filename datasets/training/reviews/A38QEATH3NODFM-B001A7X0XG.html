I think I am a fare fan of Science fiction movies, and I love to see a good adaptation from a comic, but this movie was missed the spot. First off, the acting was horrible. It seemed at time during the movie that they were reading off of cue cards or reading for the first time, no emotions with their deliveries, and the dialog back and forth was poorly written. Also, the computer animation part of the movie was to much, just didn't look good at all.  Finally, whats the deal with the antigravity everything and the color shifting cloths, Is that in the comic book?  If it is, I appologize, but if it was a movie adaptation, it would have been nice to have a little explanation behind the mechanism of some of these devices, and that would have been solved by actually puting in some real dialog.  I did not rate this a one, because it did have some ok fight scenes, but this is just worth a rental, unless you are a huge fan.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="First Class Splash"></head><body><p>I stayed away from this film for a while mainly on the basis of some comments of critics ( who I do not normally trust), some incorrect summaries, and some bad promo clips. Up front I must say that I love the surreal, so that element throughout the entire film made things superb.The driving force in this film was, of course, a first class<br />cast of actors, a very good script, and a fulfilled supernatural drive in the film ( which the VILLAGE promised but never delivered, despite that film being superbly crafted).The film shows the Journey of a supernatural being and how that being inspires a human to fulfill their greatness.The humans in a group of flats discover their higher roles, and so work to beat the forces of darkness.<br />THE DVD: The extras are very good. One missing element is a commentary. Also, one of the deleted scenes is so useful for explaining one sequence in the film ( Paul Giamatti's exploration of the Cave beneath the pool) that I find the deletion totally inexplicable.The Gag reel and the Reflections in the Water extras are very good watch, and explain<br />many parts of the film if you need them explained.</p></body></html>

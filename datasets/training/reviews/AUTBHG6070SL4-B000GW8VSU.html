<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding remake"></head><body><p>First, this is not a new movie with the same script. It has just enough differences to keep you interested, if you knew the original, while staying close to the original.<br /><br />Sometimes, it was eerily close. Meryl Streep played the role that Angela Lansbury originally had - I had never noticed the facial resemblance before. Liv Schreiber took Laurence Harvey's position as Raymond Shaw, and brought close resemblance to that role as well. The whole nervous tone of the movie was another good match. The constant background murmur of newscasts kept terrorist attacks, arms buildups, and the rest at the edge of attention. It worked fairly well in place of the original's Cold War jitters. And of course, Denzel Washington worked well - but he always does.<br /><br />A few things didn't quite keep the tone of the original. There's a weird edge to the Shaws' mother/son relationship - enough to reinforce the over-all badness of the bad guy, but otherwise gratuitous. There's also an attempt at a happy ending that just didn't work for me. Still, those weren't enough to turn me off to the movie.<br /><br />For once, a remake approaches the original movie. It replaces the Cold War bad guys with more contemporary villains, and doesn't try to follow precisely in the original's footsteps - changes that I'm sure will offend some viewers. Still, it's a good attempt and a good movie in itself. The only problem with this is the impact and importance of the movie that it follows, giving this one an impossibly high standard to meet.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

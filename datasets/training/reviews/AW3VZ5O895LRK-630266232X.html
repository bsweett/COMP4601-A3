<meta name="summary" content="I'm Always Amazed If A Film Fanatic Hasn't Seen Laura"></head><body><p>Years ago we used to go to an old theater that was an art and nostalgia theater.  The owner was a professor and he gave lectures about the movies preceding them which were wonderful.  We spent at least ten years there catching up on cinema.  One of our earliest film fanatic discoveries was LAURA. He told us our film ouvre was sadly deficient lacking this film.<br /><br />Otto Preminger was a first rate film director.  There isn't a wasted second on his picture.  There is the absolutely gorgeous Gene Tierney who plays Laura.  She was also a very good actress. Not too far into the movie, Laura is murdered .  The detective assigned to the case is the handsome, magnetic Dana Andrews. He begins by sifting through Laura's apartment.  There is a big portrait of her looking down at him almost everywhere he turns. He starts mourning the loss of such a woman as he tries to find clues to the suspect. Then the movie takes a 180 degree twist.<br /><br />I've watched it several times since, even knowing the twist and the resolution, and surprisingly,  it holds up each time.</p></body></html>

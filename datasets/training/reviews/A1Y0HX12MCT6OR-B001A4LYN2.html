<meta name="summary" content="There Will Be Perfection"></head><body><p>To celebrate my 100th passive-aggresive review shot out like projectile diarrhea out on Amazon's pages to the horror of many, I've chosen a personal favorite of mine: There Will Be Blood, where the only criticism I can find about it is the name. There Will Be Blood chronicles the life of Daniel Plainview, an ambitious miner-turned-oilman in search of fortune during the early 1900's when the industrial revolution was hitting the western United States.<br /><br />The themes present throughout the film range from family to isolation, greed to power, and creation of a town to destruction of one's mind. The whole time slowly showing Daniel's fall from grace and descent into alcohol-fueled madness in his self-percieved 'victory', whilst he's isolated himself from everyone that loved him into his hollow mansion.<br /><br />Early on in the movie one of Daniel's men dies due to a rigging accident, leaving his infant son behind to the care of Daniel Plainview. When Daniel's going from town to town offering his services he uses his 'son' H.W. to show everyone that he is a family man and not a faceless Union Oil lobbyist. As his business expands Daniel shows H.W. the tools of the trade, some tips and pointers, and is raising H.W. to be his successor. However due to another oil accident (before the insurance days) H.W. is caught in the loud pressure release of the excavation and becomes permanently deaf, unable to communicate to Daniel anymore. So what does Daniel, the warm-hearted and loving family man do? Send his son off to a San Francisco boarding school for the deaf of course! After his 'healing' from Eli however Daniel takes his son back and brings him a teacher, in order to assist with communicating.<br /><br />Near the end when Daniel is in his lofty mansion his son approaches him to tell him that he's breaking off with his father and starting his own drilling company in Mexico. Daniel takes this as a business threat and disowns H.W. right there on the spot, calling him nothing more than a cute face used for buying land. H.W. walks away and Daniel is left alone in his dark mansion, a few fleeting memories of H.W. passing through his mind, showing the audience that Daniel really did love his adopted son at some point. So what drove them apart, was it H.W. going deaf? Was it Daniel gaining all of his riches? Or did they just slowly have a falling out as H.W. matured more and grew to know his father in another light?<br /><br />Another plot point in the movie is where Daniel meets his long lost supposed brother Henry who heard about Daniel striking big and wants to offer his assistance. It is with  Henry who Daniel feels the most comfortable with revealing his deepest and darkest thoughts, how he hates most people, and wants to make a fortune to get away from everybody. The fact that Daniel trusts his supposed brother so much shows that somewhere deep down he has a sense and admiration for family bonds and trust, but somewhere for some reason he's been alienated from his own family and has a fractured family of his own. It kind of makes me laugh when I think of the scenes with Daniel, Henry, and H.W. together, a supposed 'family' when in actuallity none of them are even remotely related. Daniel eventually gains suspicions about Henry and puts him to the test to see if he's really the brother, the supposed brother who Daniel has shared his darkest secrets with has infiltrated his trust and guard. After putting Henry down Daniel is shaken to the core, knowing that his real brother is dead this is the only moment where you really see Daniel in a vulnerable state, his real family is dead and gone, and his only family is a phony act that Daniel orchestrated.<br /><br />Another major conflict in There Will Be Blood is the slow burning rivalry between Daniel and Eli Sunday, the towns local priest who rival's Daniel in his taste for money and power. Daniel and Eli both represent two opposing foundations of the United States; capitalism and religion. Daniel promises the gullible townsfolk that he'll be making everyone prospourous and rich, while Eli promises everyone that they'll be healed and receive salvation, both headstrong in their mission enough to warrant butting heads on more than one occasion, all the awhile keeping it under the noses of the townspeople.<br /><br />Eventually Daniel reaches an ultimatum from one of his prospective clients, that they'll allow him to run an oil line through their land only if he attends one of Eli's sermons and 'accepts salvation', in a great scene of Eli getting revenge on Daniel while giving the church audience a show. Daniel, in spite of bringing profit and wealth among the community, is finally confronted in front of an audience about all of his failings as a father and as a family man, triggered by his abandonment of H.W. and Henry's murder. Eli is much more enthusiastic about confronting Daniel's demons than Daniel, after Daniel threatened a union oilman's life for bringing up his family, he is left powerless due to the overwhelming number of church-goers following Eli's demands for salvation. Eli has won this round.<br /><br />Onto the final scene Daniel Plainview is woken from a liquor-fuel slumber by none other than Eli, who's apparently forgotten about the hard feelings from over a decade ago, but Daniel in his isolated alcoholic madness sure as hell hasn't, and Eli has walked right into the spider's web. Sobbing and begging for money, Eli reveals that he has gone broke and is desperate for another donation, while Daniel silently soaks up Eli's misery and despair until he erupts in a rage and bludgeons Eli to death. Daniel 'won' in a game where there are seemingly no winners.<br /><br />There are other aspects of There Will Be Blood to admire, the score itself by Johnny Greenwood punctuates the mood, creating memorable scenes, while the cinematography shows the yawning rural landscape, with all the open fields analogous with the vast potential for oil striking the United States was in at the time. There is no scene more breath-taking that I've ever seen then when H.W. is being carried away by Daniel while the oil is coming from the ground, the music, the acting, the scenery, it all molded together to what I would call the best scene of all time. When Daniel and Henry are setting the trail for the pipeline to run through the music is industrious and ambitious, and when the fifteen year time gap is shown through the melancholy violins sets the stage perfectly for the final act.<br /><br />Really I could go on and on about There Will Be Blood, this is an American classic that rewards repeat viewings, each viewing showing a subtlety in each character's behaviors, while still cloaking their true intentions and thoughts in mystery and speculation. This is not a movie for everybody, the story unfolds at a slow pace letting you get more involved in the world and despite the dumb horror movie title there is almost no blood, the violence isn't the focus of the movie, it's usually accidential and whenever there is bloodshed it's by the hands of our 'hero' Daniel Plainview. However those going in who have patience and searching for something unique will find a wholly unique and engrossing experience, going into one man's heart of darkness in the boom of the oil rise.</p></body></html>

It has been called one of the ten funniest movies ever made, and I am not about to argue that. Everything about this film works. From the casting, to the set pieces, to the dialogue, to the direction, to the soundtrack, everything clicks. One thing in the film's favor: the decision to film in glorious black and white, as in the glory days of Hollywood horror films, which this movie paid direct homage to. The cast was spot on, and you could only imagine the crack-ups that occured after each take. Peter Boyle was wonderful as the Monster, and Gene Wilder was a true genius as Fiedrich Frankenstein. Teri Garr, in an early appearance, is great as Inga, the lab assisant. Marty Feldman lends his maniacal eyes to Igor, giving a rousing performance in the process. Madeleine Kahn, as usual for this great lady, nearly steals the whole show as Dr. Frankenstein's american fiancee. She will forever be remembered for her rendition of "Love at Last I've Found You". Overall, one can tell this film was a true labor of love. Every scene is filled with detail, which this DVD release brings into sharp focus. The contrast is wonderful, the sound is sharp, and the film just glows. If Mel Brooks rather crude humor isn't your forte, this film is closer to mainstream than normal for him. As a result, he gave us a true cinema classic, and we thank him for it.</p></body></html>

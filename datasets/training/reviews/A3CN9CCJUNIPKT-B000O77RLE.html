<meta name="summary" content="Certainly worth watching, does give new shading to the Pacific War"></head><body><p>Clint Eastwood's "Letters From Iwo Jima" is an interesting departure from the traditional American war narrative that presents the Japanese army as merely a bunch of ruthless, fanatical, implacable killers who made life a living hell for the American troops that fought them in the Pacific theatre.  Here, we see gradations and nuances among the Japanese soldiers that are not typically part of the story -- draftees, sad sacks and proto-pacifists, pitted against martinets, fanatics and sadistic officers, as well as officers and high commanders who had different philosophies and different kinds of military training from one another, and who did not always agree on how best to fight the war.<br /><br />Although it is not by any means a perfect film, it is powerful.  It's certainly much better than the companion piece, Eastwood's "American" Iwo Jima film, "Flags Of Our Fathers," which I found muddled and often trite. "Letters" is clearly the film that was most important to Eastwood to get right -- he pours more feeling into it, and gave it a much stronger and more cohesive narrative.  I agree that it's not the greatest war film ever made, but it does open up a new dialogue on some important historical issues, and presents, however obliquely, a tragic picture of the death of Japan's vestigial bushido honor code on the pyre of modern mass warfare.<br /><br />I think this film does an adequate job of presenting Japanese wartime society as a spectrum of opinions and temperaments -- it's simplistic, yes, but that is the nature of a feature film script, and to the degree that Eastwood does *not* present the Japanese as a monolithic culture, I think the film is a success.  The portrayal of Iwo Jima as a doomed, desperate last stand -- an Asian Alamo, if you will -- is interesting as well, although Eastwood may oversell this point, and gives little indication (in this film) of how tough formidable the Japanese soldiers were, or the degree to which they had an efficient, modern military.  By the time of this battle, their fleet had been crushed and their supply lines and command and control were breaking down so looking just at this moment in time is a little misleading, although not entirely inaccurate.  I'm not a big WWII buff, but I think its obvious that Eastwood has walked a fine line between different factions who choose to view history in various ways.  And, yes, it's a Hollywood film, so it resorts to melodrama and simplification... Yet it still presents a viewpoint that has rarely been seen, particularly by American audiences.  It's worth adding to our historical repertoire, and gives us some new shadings of understanding about the war, putting a more human face on was has been traditionally portrayed as a near-inhuman foe.  It's worth checking out, and seems to have been a labor of love on Eastwood's part.  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)</p></body></html>

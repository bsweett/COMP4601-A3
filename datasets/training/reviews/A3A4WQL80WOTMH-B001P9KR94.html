In the Hindu epic Ramayana, Sita is stolen from Rama by the great demon king and the story that follows is the quest to get her back.  Amazing how the classic love story still works so well in a modern context.  I had picked up the book and skimmed a few parts, didn't buy it.  I've read a lot of Indian authors and what I'd read of Slumdog Millionare (the novel) hadn't done much for me - it had seemed somewhat contrived, though to be fair, I didn't read the whole book.  Anyway, it was with some curiousity (and doubt) that I put this film on tonight with a friend.  Wow!  What an exciting movie! Danny Boyle has created a masterpiece.</p></body></html>

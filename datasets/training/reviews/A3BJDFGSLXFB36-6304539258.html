Since its initial release it has become a long-lasting international phenomenon and an American cultural icon. How many other films in history have kept such a large and faithful fan base 30 years after it was released?<br /><br />This latest (and I'm POSITIVE it's not the last) release of this classic film is somewhat of a letdown. Many were outraged at the 1997 special edition and demanded the original theatrical release, but it looked as though that was not going to happen (yeah, right!). Finally, the original untouched version was given to us, but with no image upgrade or quality sound; plus, the image was letterboxed, not widescreen (BIG difference for those "in the know" and care about such things (like me)).<br /><br />Fear not, true believers. In an attempt to bag another zillion, Lucas is sure to release yet another version of his beloved creation, only this time it will be in DTS and Dolby 5.1 as well as anamorphic widescreen.<br /><br />You know it's going to happen. It's just a matter of time.<br /><br />As for me, I REFUSE to purchase this title (I purchased the 2004 special editions because it was all I could get at the time). When Lucas finally comes to his senses and releases what I really want, I'll be happy to part with some of my money. Until that day, any other "editions" will be completely ignored by me.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Why did I wait so long? A fresh and refreshing view of a much speculated Queen"></head><body><p>LOVED IT...let's start there!<br />I finally did something right IMO; I disregarded all of the controversial press this film received,read Antonia Fraser's book from which director Sofia Coppola drew her inspiration,bought the DVD,watched it....and WAS ASTOUNDED!!!THIS IS NOT ANOTHER DOCUDRAMA, so be advised!<br /><br />This film is so eye-catching and refreshingly unique in its approach to the much documented and oft misunderstood Marie Antoinette ( an endearing and perfectly innocent Kirsten Dunst),the Austrian Princess who,at the young age of 14 is married out to Prince Louis 16th to secure an alliance between Austria and France.Coppola,using Fraser's novel,recreates an image of carefree decadence and careless youth in bold colors and daring costumes (Oscar winner Milena Canonero-"Chariots of Fire") as Antoinette flitters around the real Versailles Palace learning to adjust to French Court life,a ridiculously shy "husband" (Jason Schwartzman?-THIS CASTING  WORKS!!!!), and the ridicule and gossip that cuts like a knife from the courtiers.This film is bathed in candy colors and fresh pastels that Coppola uses to convey a sense of 21st century sensibility to an 18th story.Coppola uses gorgeous Baroque French music and opera to give us a feel for the times, but is unabashedly bold to use heavy metal rock tunes in order to bring her unique and fresh perspective on a Queen whose youth and inexperience at life and lack of knowledge concerning "her adopted people" causes her most ruinous downfall.Coppola's view towards Antoinette,like Fraser's book, is sympathetic towards their subject.This is good,because Marie Antoinette was much skewered by the Press and much false propaganda caused much distrust among the French.Fraser,s book and Coppola's film endeavour to possibly correct some,not all, of the misconceptions surrounding the Royal Couple.<br />Other films that add light on Marie Antoinette and Court Life would be THE AFFAIR OF THE NECKLACE,PBS' MARIE ANTOINETTE,MARIE ANTOINETTE:QUEEN OF VERSAILLES,SADE,RIDICULE,LADY AND THE DUKE,THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL (any version) and somewhat AMADEUS.<br />I challenge viewers to see this film with an open eye and mind.It is revelatory while being incredibly innovative,eye-dazzling and downright entertaining.<br />One of the smartest films I ever waited to see.DVD extras contain a great look at Coppola and her vision for this work.<br />VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</p></body></html>

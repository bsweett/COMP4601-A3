Where we find our heroes is in the movies, and unfortunately we find them, not in or of the world in which we live, but among Superman, Daredevil, Batman and for the last couple of years we find it in Peter Parker or as he's better known...Spiderman.<br />Peter Parker as portrayed by Tobey Maguire is a conflicted hero: he knows what he needs to do, what he is destined to do but he's torn between Superherodom and an ordinary life of College, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and his best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco looking more and more like James Dean every minute).<br />"Spiderman 2" is a touching, sad movie with a major emphasis away from the physical feats of daring and a audacious move towards, for this type of genre movie, the personal and emotional life of it's hero: Peter Parker wants a normal life but realizes that it is not in the cards for him.<br />Sam Raimi, director of "Spiderman2" has opted to make a movie filled with pathos and sadness, though the scenes of daring-do are done with bravado and expertise as befits this genre. But the lingering feeling you take away from this movie is one of emotional angst and the very real feeling that emotional connections are not easily attained nor kept. It is a very unfortunate reality of the world in which we now live: life is hell even for the super-human.</p></body></html>

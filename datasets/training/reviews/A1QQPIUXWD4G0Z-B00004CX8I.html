<meta name="summary" content="A Very Powerful and Moving Film"></head><body><p>Milos Forman's adaptation of Ken Kesey's novel is a powerful film touching on individuality, institutional oppression, and the phenomenon of group-think.  With a great cast of actors under Milos' experienced direction, the film is a classic sociological/psychological study of the human condition.<br /><br />Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) thinks he has outsmarted the judicial system by pleading insanity as his defense to his criminal trial.  Although he feels he can easily keep his cool by spending his time in the looney farm instead of prison, Randle soon realizes that he's over his head in the cold and rigid order of psychiatric institutions. His antagonist is the cold and bureaucratic Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher)who sees caring for the mentally ill as nothing more than dropping pills in patients' mouths and supervising frontal lobotomies; Randle's questioning of her authority and qualifications does nothing but ruffle her feathers and she's just waiting to put him in his place like all of her other little patients. Despite his rebellious spirit, this is a fight that Randall can't win as he is, after all, officially crazy and who would listen to the appeals of madman either inside or outside the walls of a sanitarium?<br /><br />This is an outstanding film where Milos Forman touches upon the subtle nuances of the human character and the strange wisdom fools often have despite their mental quirks.  It is not surprising that this film won multiple Academy Awards for 1976: it is simply a very touching film about the human spirit.  I strongly recommend it.</p></body></html>

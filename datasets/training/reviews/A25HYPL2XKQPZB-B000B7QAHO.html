<meta name="summary" content="Cute and charming movie, nothing more"></head><body><p>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is Tim Burton's take on the classic children's tale by Rohald Dahl and an update of the dated 1970's movie starring Gene Wilder.  The movie opens setting up the story.  Charlie Bucket lives with his parents and four grandparents and they are beyond poor.  Their shack in the middle of town is bent and twisted and full of holes.  But they live in happiness and hope and entertain each other with stories of their past.  When news hits town that Willy Wonka is opening his factory to five children via a Golden Ticket, Charlie is hopeful he will get one.  His birthday candy bar doesn't contain one nor does the bar he buys with his grandpa's money.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the four other tickets are found by amusing charachitures of kids with the worst traits:  they are gluttoness, spoiled, selfish and rotten and none appreciate the fact they have a golden ticket.  Charlie finds some money on the ground and buys a candy bar.  Amazingly, this bar has a ticket in it.<br /><br />The five kids show up with one family member each at the factory.  Up to this point, Wonka is a mysterious character, being a part of the story but never being shown.  He makes his appearance after a ghastly puppet show introduces him at the factory.  Wonka, played by Depp, is a quirky, amusing guy with a childhood that haunts him to this day.  Some have likened his appearance to that of Michael Jackson.  That only comes through in spots. Wonka as played by Depp is an amusing unique character.<br /><br />The fun part of the movie begins when the kids enter the factory.  All the parts of the story are there, with each of the four bad kids meeting a temporary demise by giving into the worst of their character.  The candy looks delicious and the factory is beautiful to see.  I think kids will like the movie although my four year old was concerned when Augustus Gloop got sucked up the pipe from the Chocolate River.<br /><br />This movie is cute and fun for kids and adults, yet I don't think I laughed outloud once or came close to sharing any sympathy for Charlie or Willy Wonka.</p></body></html>

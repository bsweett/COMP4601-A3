Basically the movie is set in the late 21st century, a subculture of humans have emerged who have been modified genetically by a vampire-like disease Hemophagia, giving them enhanced powers which creates great fear among the normal people who try to wipe them out. In the middle of this is an infected woman Ultraviolet, who finds herself protecting a 9 year old boy who has been marked for death by the human government.  A lot of special effects and butt kicking, but the story doesn't hold up and is not that satisfying.  If you like straight out action, then maybe give this one a chance.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A fun creature feature with heart?"></head><body><p>When you watch the film like the Host, you're kind of reminded of just how fresh it seems even if the plot isn't exactly brand new. Sure the idea of a mutated creature running rampant has been done before (The Relic, Mimic), the political messages and a more family-oriented tone rather than just out-and-out carnage but somehow the film successfully brings all of these together with a film that, yes, while being not completely original and it does have a few minor flaws, it still manages to entertain.<br /><br />Park Gang-Hu is a concession stand worker living near the Han River. There with his dad Hie-Bong and daughter Hyun-Seo, he gets quite the surprise one day when a mutated creature from the river arrives and rampages through the park, eating and kidnapping some of the people including Hyun-Seo. But misinformation and an overbearing government declares the creature biologically contagious and can infect others, including Gang-Hu, Hie-Bong, university student and Hyun-Seo's uncle Nam-Il and her auntie, archer Nam-Joo. They 4 of them have to try and escape the authorities and save Hyun-Seo who's being kept alive by the creature for a future meal.<br /><br />The film starts out with an incredibly memorable attack as the creature first makes its appearance. And like one reviewer said, you're sort of taken aback by just how quick it's seen onscreen. None of that Jaws or Alien stuff where it takes so long to see the creature, it just shows it in full-view dropping into the river then as its running towards camera. Also I find the creature to be well-animated and doesn't look like a hideous blob like the crocodile in Primeval. One complaint is that it does look a bit too texture-y and very noticeable but as a whole, the creature is well done.<br /><br />As for the rest of the film after the attack, it's also just as good although some might feel it doesn't have that pull the opening did. You get quite sympathetic for the family and hope that somehow, this odd-yet-functioning family finds the daughter but you almost wish the creature would pop up more since we can go literally 20 minutes without even seeing anything and you kind of wonder where it went and why it's not doing anything. It's fine to slow the pace down and chat but it's not as tension-filled as it should've been. But the tone is quite well done such as the humor that comes in or the handling of the governments and isn't as bothersome as one might think.<br /><br />Whether or not it's on par with Jaws or Alien shouldn't even be an issue since all 3 films succeed on different merits. One's fun, one's scary and this one's kind of a blend of the 2.</p></body></html>

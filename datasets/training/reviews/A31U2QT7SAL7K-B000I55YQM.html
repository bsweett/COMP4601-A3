<meta name="summary" content="Better appreciated when not compared to the original"></head><body><p>As a stand-alone film, the &quot;re-visitation&quot; of Frankenheimer's 1962 classic is quite good. Washington, Shrieber, and Streep acquit themselves admirably in roles previously covered by Sinatra, Harvey, and Lansbury. Kimberly Elise does well in the tremendously altered role of &quot;Rosie&quot;, originally assayed by Janet Leigh. And Jeffrey Wright is on screen briefly, but memorably, as a soldier tormented by the same nightmares that plague Washington and Shrieber.<br /><br /> The different elements of plot between the two films are reflective of the times in which they were produced. Demme continues to use his technique of having the actors speak directly into the camera. This adds an eerie touch to the presentation, making the viewer feel as though he is part of the action.<br /><br /> There are a few slow passages and the convention hall sequence near the film's end seems protracted.<br /><br /> I saw the film with a mixed group, half appearing to have seen the original while the others were totally alien to the classic. The latter had no frame of reference and could possibly appreciate the newer version better.<br /><br /> As an owner of the Sinatra film, I found myself comparing and contrasting the two. This may have resulted in my giving the newer movie less than five stars.<br /><br /> Lansbury as the first &quot;Mrs. Shaw&quot;, along with James Gregory as her befuddled Senator husband, were just too awesome and memorable to erase from my brain.</p></body></html>

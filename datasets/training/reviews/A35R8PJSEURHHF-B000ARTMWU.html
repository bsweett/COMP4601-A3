It was tense, exciting, nerve wracking....then the ending just ruined it all.<br /><br />Most of what you see in this film is just what the killer is imagining.  I'd say only 15% of the movie actually happened.  Everything else is just a dream.  We don't figure this out until they reveal the ending.<br /><br />While this could work for most people, many of us have seen this same plot device used many times before in other movies or TV shows, so the idea is old and basically just ruins the film for me.</p></body></html>

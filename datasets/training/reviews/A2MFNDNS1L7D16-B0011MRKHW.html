<meta name="summary" content="The real red meat of  Elizabeth's reign."></head><body><p>First the table is set for us. England is in trouble. Spain rules supreme with a vastly superior navy, The Spanish Armada. Phillip of Spain in a fanatical despot. A Catholic obcessed with destroying Elizabeth, the "bastard queen" who is by the way, Protestant. That alone didn't set her apart. It was her williness to allow her subjects to worship as they wished, a very radical notion at the time. By 1585, Elizabeth is middle-aged & probably not going to marry or have an heir. But she is still a woman & Sir Walter Raleigh comes into her life. He is a privateer, an adventerer, good-looking & cool as hell. He entertains her with stories of the new world which he has visited, claimed & named for her... Virginia. She falls for him & commands he stay. He tires of court life & desires to return to sea. Eventually, he takes up with Elizabeth's favorite Lady-in-waiting, Bess. Sir Walter impregnates & marries her, in that order, apparently. This of course enrages the Queen. Soon however there are more important things to deal with. She had been forced by her advisors to execute her cousin(?) Mary, Queen of Scots,  a Catholic claiming she is the rightful queen. The Spanish Armada is coming with troops to invade England. Elizabeth, looking very butch in her armour,<br />addreses her troops who are to defend England. But they don't have to.<br />Shortly, a storm intervenes, destroying the Armada & Phillip's dreams.<br />  The tone of this movie was somewhat lighter than the first. Just the ligther colors & sprit conveyed the idea that Elizabeth had coosolidated her power, which was absolute. Perhaps the best years of her reign. If you like history, you'll  appreciate this effort. However accurate it is much of it is historical fact. Considering we are looking back over 400 years it is really excellent. Forget that it is history, if you must. It is still a pretty good story.</p></body></html>

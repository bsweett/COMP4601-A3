<meta name="summary" content="A few laughs but generally a terrible film"></head><body><p>This irreverent homage the second rate 70's television show of the same name can't decide whether it wants to be a screw ball, tasteless comedy, or just a trip down memory lane. There are three good laughs in this movie - the rest of it is just terrible. Ben Stiller is a terrifically talented comedic actor, but he must indeed be desperate if this is all he's being offered. The lackluster story involving cocaine dealers merely serves as an excuse to team Starsky (Stiller), the neurotic, by-the-book cop, with Hutch (Owen Wilson), the laid-back, somewhat bent, cool dude.<br /><br />The story revolves around a drug dealer (Vince Vaughn), who has remarkably come up with a new type of cocaine that tastes like artificial sweetener, and that is immune from sniffer dogs.  Juliette Lewis plays his ditzy, junky girlfriend who is helping him sell the drugs to a local crime syndicate.  However, Starsky and Hutch, with the help of a local black gangster, Huggy Bear (Snoop Dogg), are hot on the trail of the syndicate. As the film progresses, both cops are shot at, and ridiculed by their fellow officers for being prissy and not being up to the task of hunting down the criminals.<br /><br />The story is really a vehicle for presenting a number of site gags (some of which work and some don't), and for highlighting the dreadful hairstyles, clothes, and disco dancing of the period. One of the funniest scenes is when Starsky - thinking that the cocaine is actually sweetener - accidentally consumes it in his coffee, and goes out on a mad, competitive disco dancing spree. Although, amusing, the scene may as well be from another movie, as it bares no relevance to the actual story. There's a fun scene featuring Will Ferrell as a perverted convict with a thing for belly buttons - he makes the uncomfortable Hutch bare his, and then makes both Starsky and Hutch act out some bizarre dragon scene while shirtless. Carmen Electra also provides some laughs and does a good job of playing a cheerleader who gets off on undressing in front of the cops. Most of the humour, however, falls pretty flat and eventually becomes overly self-conscious. The whole film runs out of steam towards then end and fast becomes sour and quite stupid.

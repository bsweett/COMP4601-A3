Almost everything in this film was recycled from other films and that really hurts the outcome if you think too much about it. But if you take it on face value you are bound to enjoy it much more. There are some very funny bits but nothing too original. The directing is alright but since Tom Dey is still in action comedy mode after "Showtime" he tends to make some of the sports sequences look like action sequences, which was a bit odd. The one scene that I ejnoyed but was shot like an action sequence was the paintball game, it was very entertaining watching Sarah Jessica Parker scream and crawling on the ground running away from big men with paintball guns. And the thing that works best is the cast. Everyone was perfectly cast. "Failure to Launch" is one of the best cast movies I have seen in a while. The best thing about this film is Zooey Deschanel. She is one of the best actresses and delivers the best dead-pan humor. Overall, "Failure to Launch" is very decent, nothing great. Some funny parts, some dumb parts but overall worthy. Its a great date movie or to take the family but kids should be over 13 due to some nudity from Terry Bradshaw, funny scene but kinda gross. Overall 7/10</p></body></html>

This is one of his best films since "Platoon" (1986), which he won an Oscar for Best Picture and Best Director! He has also won Best Director for "Born On The Fourth Of July" (1989) & Best Screenplay for "Midnight Express" (1978) This is worthy of an Oscar nomination for Stone. Nicolas Cage is brilliant as John McLoughlin, a performance worthy of an Oscar nomination. Michael Pena is excellent as Will Jimeno, another Oscar-worthy performance. Maria Bello (as McLoughlin's wife Donna) & Maggie Gyllenhaal (as Jimeno's wife Allison) give excellent performances as their wives, two other Oscar-worthy performances. Andrea Berloff's (who wrote the upcoming remake "Don't Look Now" (2007), this is her debut film) screenplay is brilliant! The music by Craig Armstrong is brilliant! The cinematography by Seamus McGarvey is brilliant! The film editing by David Brenner (who has worked with Stone since "Salvador" (1986) & won the Oscar for his work on "Born On The Fourth Of July" & Julie Monroe (who has also worked with Stone since "Salvador") is brilliant! The casting by Kerry Barden (who has worked with Stone since "Any Given Sunday" (1999), Billy Hopkins (who has worked with Stone since "Wall Street" (1987), Shalimar Reodica, Paul Schnee, Suzanne Smith (who has worked with Stone since "Born On The Fourth Of July & Mary Vernieu (who has worked with Stone since "The Doors" (1991) is brilliant! The production design by Jan Roelfs (who worked with Stone on "Alexander" (2004) is brilliant! The art direction by Richard L. Johnson (who worked with Stone on "Born On The Fourth Of July") is brilliant! The set decoration by Beth A. Rubino is brilliant! The costume design by Michael Dennison is brilliant! This is one of the year's best! This is just as impressive as "United 93" (2006) is. This is a film to remember on Oscar night.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="ORIGINAL and THRILLING!!"></head><body><p>First and foremost, SIN CITY is a treat for the eyes.  There's never been a movie that looks quite like this one.  It was filmed largely in front of green-screen sets, much like SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW.  Unlike that dreary movie, which tried to make us believe the "sets" were real, SIN CITY tries to make us believe the entire movie is a comic book that's been animated.  It attempts a lot technically, and ACHIEVES it.  There are a few moments in the movie (the shot of Bruce Willis leaving prison, with snow coming down on him, for example) that are beautiful, pure and simple.  Others are whimsical.  Others give us vertiginous angles that wouldn't be possible in "real life."  The movie is worth a look just for the technical aspects.<br /><br />I've never read anything by Frank Miller.  I'm not a graphic novel reader.  But I am a fan of film noir, and what I loved about this movie was the way it melded "old style" film noir narration (a la the books of Dashiel Hammett or Raymond Chandler) with a modern sensibility.  The movie is also ultra-violent, but if you read something like RED HARVEST by Hammett, written in the 1920's, you see that streets running red with blood is hardly a new thing.<br /><br />The movie tells three (OK, four) loosely interweaving stories that are set in this metropolis that is utterly corrupt.  No one "normal" even seems to live there...it's populated entirely by corrupt cops, killers, strippers, hookers and psychopaths.  Some of them have hearts of gold, or at least, hearts that aren't totally black, and these are our heroes.  I don't want to delve into the details of each story, but I found them all fascinating, although the first major story, with Mickey Rourke as the disfigured tough Marv may have been my favorite.  I felt it most cleanly walked the line between humor, pathos and suspense.  His character was an original.<br /><br />Nearly everyone in the movie was terrific.  You can tell they were energized by taking part in Robert Rodriquez's little experiment.  Mickey Rourke was outstanding...too bad no one will recognize him, because this could be his comeback vehicle.  Clive Owen (whom I've always found a bit hard to warm up to) was very good...tough, vulnerable, funny.  Bruce Willis does his patented world-weary cop, but there's a reason he keeps getting parts like that...he's darn good in them.  Benicio Del Toro clearly had fun with his creepy role.  Elijah Wood, while not really called upon to "perform", certainly shatters his "good hobbit" image in this flick!<br /><br />The women don't fare quite so well.  The parts are somewhat underwritten and incidental.  Jessica Alba is the most important female character, and while she looks the part, her acting talents aren't totally up to snuff.  Not enough to make one cringe, but there could have been more depth.  Rosario Dawson really chomps into her role...she fares best among the women.  Alexis Bleidl is OK and Brittany Murphy overacts mightily. I know many will find the movie to be anti-woman.  True, women aren't portrayed in too great a light here...but you know what?  Men aren't either.  These people are all just shades of scum...some scummier than others.  But the women are also strong and can "take care of themselves."  So, if you want to argue the movie glorifies violence...that's one thing.  But hates women?  That's a non-starter for me.<br /><br />But this movie, primarily, is a feast for the senses.  A great overall visual look (Visual Effects supervisor:  Robert Rodriquez), great editing (Rodriquez) and camera work (Rodriquez).  Good musical score (co-composed by Rodriquez) and great sound work.  It's a dizzyingly fast-paced movie that never feels hurried.  There's always something fun to listen to or to see.<br /><br />It is VERY violent.  If you were turned off by KILL BILL,  you might be equally appalled by the violence here.  Absolutely not for little kids.  But if you want a visceral  treat, this is a MUST SEE movie.  I thoroughly enjoyed myself, and am ready to see it again!</p></body></html>

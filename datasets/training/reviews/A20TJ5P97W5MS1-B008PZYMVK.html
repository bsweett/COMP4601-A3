How about John Malkovich? Well this is a complete & thorough study of what that might be like and what could go wrong if that experience was available to pretty much anyone willing to pay a small price. This is actually a very interesting movie that came out in the very interesting year of 1999. It stars John Malkovich, John Cusack (one of the greatest hopeless romantics of all time, this guy never wins), Cameron Diaz, and Cathrine Keener all in arguably career defining roles. This film is a tour de force in strange and abstract film making. It is experimental cinema at its finest. The concept of entering the mind of John Malcovich is stretched in many different ways. The meaning behind Being John Malkovich could be interpreted exponentially. It is a success because it ultimately comes down to what is going on inside your head while you are watching this strange and bizarre gem.<br /><br />John Malcovich: I got to know the truth!<br /><br />Charlies Sheen: Truth is for suckers, Johnny Boy.</p></body></html>

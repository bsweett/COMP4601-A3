<meta name="summary" content="Ang Lee's magical mix of lyricism and adventure"></head><body><p>I disagree with the reviewers who complain that this movie is nothing more than another martial arts movie.  This movie combines its own mythology with the atmosphere of ancient China and the timeless themes of honor and love.  There's plenty of action for those who like fast paced films, but there's also depth and excellent acting/characterizations for those of us who want to take more away from a movie than a few entertaining hours.<p>To greatly simplify the plot: a business woman who is also a warrior (despite the taboos of both) arrives in Beijing with a legendary sword entrusted to her by the man she loves.  When the sword is stolen, a heart-racing series of events are set into motion.  The sword must be recovered, the culprit caught, order restored. Beneath the surface, the unfilled love between the aging business woman and the owner of the sword simmers, especially as the story of a headstrong young noblewoman unfolds.  <p>Yun-Fat Chow and Michelle Yeon, as the platonic and honor-bound couple, play their roles with quiet confidence, giving their characters extraordinary range with the smallest of gestures.  Even newcomer Zhang Ziyi carries her role as the stubborn and talented daughter of a dignitary with aplomb.  Ang Lee has directed a winner that deserves a place among classics.  I am completely amazed at his ability to stage the dramatic battle scenes, evoke an ancient culture, and still inject a tremendous amount of humanity in what is, at its most basic, an action film.  The result is a warm and lyrical tale, visually stunning and heartfelt.<p>I know much has been made of the special effects used to animate the fighting.  To those who say its lack of realism detracts from the movie, I say you missed the point.  The gravity defying leaps and the straight-up-the-wall running highlight the mythology.  We are meant to take these events not only literally but as symbols of something greater.  <p>The DVD provides special features that are all well done and interesting, although, as with all DVD's, I wish they were more substantial.  <p>I highly recommend this movie.  My whole family adored it - from my thirteen year old daughter to my husband.</p></body></html>

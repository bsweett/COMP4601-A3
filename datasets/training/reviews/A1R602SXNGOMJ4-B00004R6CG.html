It is perhaps the most long winded, boring, and drawn out Hitchcock films I have ever had the misfortune to watch.  The first hour or so is spent with Jimmy Stewart on some wild goose chase following a friend's wife to see if she's possessed by a demon(?!?). For some inexplicable reason, he falls in love with her. Once we reach what we're first to believe is the climax, we learn he's been duped somewhat. As have we.  The last 45 minutes certainly move more fluidly, but Jimmy Stewart's character becomes so obsessive and controlling, he ought to have been served a restraining order.  Also odd are a surrealistic dream sequence that gets so near to a cartoon it reminded me of the "Pink Elephants" sequence in Dumbo, and an ending that redefines the meaning of "abrupt".  But if you're like me, and enjoy Hitchcock films for their pure ability to keep you tense and on the edge of your seat, Vertigo is not the film to watch.</p></body></html>

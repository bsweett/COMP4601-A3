<meta name="summary" content="Good movie but different enemy, different Jack Ryan, almost a different story."></head><body><p>A downed Israeli jet carrying a nuclear bomb creates a suspenseful and catastrophic disaster 29 years later.  The bomb is found damaged but the fissionable material can be reformed into a new weapon.  A radical Neo-Nazi gets his hands on the old bomb and plans to remake the world.<br /><br />Jack Ryan (Ben Affleck) and William Cabot the CIA Director (Morgan Freeman) are in Russia inspecting the Russian nuclear munitions facilities to assure that the bombs are being decommissioned per the STARK treaty.  Jack thinks it is odd that three Russian scientists are not at the facilities during the inspection.  The ones that are missing are just the guys you would want to have if you wanted to build a nuclear bomb.  Ryan and Cabot are invited to the Kremlin to meet the new president Alexander Nemerov who has taken over after the death of the former president of a heart attack.  The meeting is tense.<br /><br />The USA is nervous over the new Russian President and his aggressive military policies.  He even allows a chemical attack to be launched against the people in Chechnya.  Meanwhile a stray nuclear bomb in the wrong hands might just provide the catalyst to start a full blown nuclear war.....<br /><br />I liked this movie for entertainment but I have to say that I am a real fan of Tom Clancy and I did not like how the great and intense story was changed to match the cast selected and the whim of Hollywood to be politically correct.  So much was changed that it could have almost been a different story regarding the antagonist in the book versus the movie.<br /><br />One of the key aspects that made the movie good was the tremendous performance of Morgan Freeman who was spectacular as the CIA Director.  Ben Affleck also does a good job in the movie but the role he played was a bit over the top in the end of the movie.  Since I expected the movie to be like the book I read and enjoyed I lowered the rating of the movie.  If I hadn't read the book or been such a fan of Tom Clancy, I would have rated the movie higher.  I thought the movie was action filled and intense but it is like when you expect something to happen and it turns out totally different from your expectations.  Different enemy, different Jack Ryan, almost a different story.<br /><br />If you want to watch a good movie then this one is good, if you want to watch a movie with Jack Ryan like in the book, then they should have kept Harrison Ford in the story and left the storyline like the book.</p></body></html>

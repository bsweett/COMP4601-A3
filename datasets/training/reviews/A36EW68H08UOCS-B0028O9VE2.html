James Brooks has made some witty dramedies in the past, and Spanglish isn't going to make anyone forget "Terms of Endearment" or "As Good As It Gets", but it's not bad.<br /><br />Paz Vega stars as Flor, a Mexican immigrant who is in almost every scene yet speaks hardly any English.  Flor's husband has inexplicably left Flor and their young daughter, Cristina.  Cristina is portrayed as a 12 year old by the wonderful Shelbie Bruce.  She is not only an accomplished young actress, but most of her scenes are bilingual as she acts as interpreter between Flor and the Clasky family.<br /><br />Flor comes to America and is hired as a domestic for John and Deborah Clasky.  Sandler portrays John, who has opened a little restaurant after moving from New York and is declared by the New York Times the Greatest Chef in America.  Not much is made of his Cheffing - he could have as easily been Greatest Dog-Catcher, Salesman, etc.  Deborah is portrayed by Tea Leoni, and Deborah has issues.  I've read many reviews that suggest that her performance is a little "out there". Roger Ebert wrote "Deborah doesn't just go over the top, she waves goodbye as she disappears into cuckoo-land."<br /><br />In my professional dealings I unfortunately encounter Deborah's kind frequently.  Deborah was a high-powered type A executive until she was downsized, and now she's all type A and no outlet.  Her family - in fact everyone in contact with her - suffers for it.<br /><br />Cloris Leachman has a wonderful role as Deborah's mother, an alcoholic who was once a notable jazz singer.  She loves Deborah when pretty much no one else can, and she insightfully tells us at the end of the movie that she hasn't had a drink in weeks, and no one noticed, which must mean that she was a pretty well-functioning drunk.<br /><br />The Clasky's have a little girl about the same age as Flor's Cristina, and Sarah Steele's performance as Bernice is as good as Shelbie Bruce's Cristina - just without the bilingual dialogue.  Bernice is a smart, cheerful pre-teen with a little weight problem, and Deborah does and says all the things that dent Bernice's self-esteem.<br /><br />Deborah is high-strung and neurotic, Flor is beautiful and sweet-natured.  Is it possible John might be attracted to someone other than Deborah?<br /><br />I expected conflict - maybe even a little adultery - but the way Brooks' screenplay works through these issues was both realistic and satisfyingly open-ended.<br /><br />Reviewers who complain that the film ends with many issues unresolved must live lives that have all their issues resolved as well.<br /><br />Not the best Brooks.  But not as bad as much dreck released these days.</p></body></html>

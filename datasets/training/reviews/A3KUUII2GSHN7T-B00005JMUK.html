<meta name="summary" content="Empathy and its absolute worse."></head><body><p>Hollywood and its baby brother on the indy front have decided they don't want to make movies that mean anything anymore. They have decided, like an overbearingly pompous mother, just what is good for us. Gone are the days of films like One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, The Apostle, The Shawshank Redemption and other films that changed our movie habits forever. They do, however, have a newfound liking for films that empathize with characters caught in a nigthmarish hell and that seize our emotions and shatter them like glass. I'm sorry if I sound the part of a simpleton here, but nihilism is getting tiresome.<br /><br />In Monster, the empathy for a woman who, although having things done to her so heinous that I felt sick at the thought of the miscreants who hurt her, still seems to scream at us - in the films theme, that is - that it's not really her fault that she now kills people. It was the fault of the rapist who molested her at age of eight. It was the fault of the man who rapes her when she starts "hooking." It was the fault of society. It wasn't her fault when she takes an innocent man out to a field and shoots in in the back of the head.<br /><br />I hated when the film started to twist its ugly, but nowadays predictably thematic head. Another gem of a "thinking" film was at it again, bringing forth all its pretention and presumption along with it. The message, escorted handsomely by numerous awards for Therin and the film, told us, "If you village dwellers don't grasp our statement here, you probably adore films like  The Wedding Planner and Racing Stripes."<br /><br />WRONG!<br /><br />I got the theme and I almost puked all over myself. I can empathize with a woman who's been pained by a terrible childhood and life - both of my parents have lived through nightmarish hells as children and grown into people who love others without condition - but I will not empathize with that woman when she decides to keep the cycle of hell going by taking life.<br /><br />I would have liked to have watched a film about the family of the innocent man who is killed in the field. I would have enjoyed that very much, being that it would be an honest balance. But alas, you will never see that. Curse these film gurus for dishing it out so one-sidedly.<br /><br />I assume many of you will dismiss my opinion but for those of you who have doubts, save yourself from washing off the vomit and the unwanted influx of tears from your already tattered movie shirt.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Jacket scores with Brody's performance"></head><body><p>Adrien Brody (The Pianist, The Singing Detective) stars as Jack Starks, a veteran who got shot in the head and miraculously survived. One day on the road, he meets a little girl and her mother as he fixes their car for them. Then, he is thrown into a mental place, led by doctor Kris Kristofferson (Blade Trilogy, A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries) and the good doctor puts Brody in a straight jacket and shoves him in a small compartment. Brody goes all crazy until he finds out he can go into the future and that's where he meets actress Keira Knightley (Pirates Of The Caribbean, The Hole). Brody finds out that Knightley is the little girl he helped out on the road. Suddenly, he finds out that he dies and he goes forward into the future to try to figure out who killed in and how he died. Interesting premise anchored by Adrien Brody's performance. Kristofferson is really creepy as the doctor. Also starring Jennifer Jason Leigh (In The Cut, Backdraft), Daniel Craig (Layer Cake, Sylvia) and Kelly Lynch (Road House, Mr. Magoo)</p></body></html>

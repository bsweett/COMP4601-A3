<meta name="summary" content="The BEST James Bond Film"></head><body><p>GOLDFINGER is a very good movie. Perhaps it is the best James Bond film of he entire series. This one film contains many definitive aspects of all the James Bond films in the series. GOLDFINGER is very different from its two predecessors. The level of sophistication is much higher. Visually it is more stunning and is lavishly produced establishing a high standard for many of the cinematic elements associated with a James Bond film. Sean Connery gives his most sophisticated and distinguished performance as James Bond in GOLDFINGER. His friendly and easygoing approach in this film combined with his look of determination and confidence, wit, charm and a physical dexterity all add to his arsenal for self-preservation in order to see the job of eliminating the opposition to fruition. Even the main villain Goldfinger, who is more menacing and cunningly diabolical than his predecessors, is given greater depth by screenwriters Richard Maibaum and Paul Dehn. Gert Frobe's performance and visual presence as Goldfinger is one of the highlights of this film and the series. He is a constant menace to Bond as they play a cat and mouse game throughout the film. The intriguing golf game is a highlight of their confrontation. Once again another distinctive element to the Bond formula is introduced during the golf game in the form of Oddjob, the main villain's henchman who kills his victims with a steal edged bowler hat. Returning to Richard Maibaum and Paul Dehn, it can be seen that the script of GOLDFINGER is perhaps the best structured and balanced giving the plot elements, action sequences and the familiar Bond gadgets integrated treatment producing a solid story. Their script is also rich with character development meticulously incorporated into the story, which is never intrusive to the film's flow but is part of the cohesiveness of all the visuals skillfully directed by Guy Hamilton and expertly edited together by Peter Hunt. Of those visuals it is Production Designer Ken Adam's distinctive set designs that also help define the film's "Bond look" where he creates a unique look of functionally modern almost futuristic sets that dominate the screen with his iconic style. Cinematographer Ted Moore did some of his best work on this film utilizing photographic techniques to produce a dynamic and lavish look to this film. John Barry composed (along with lyricists Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley) the main title to GOLDFINGER sung by Shirley Bassey, which is probably the most recognizable song from the series and immediately brings to mind images of James Bond to this day. This melody used and often referred to throughout the score integrates the James Bond Theme along with John Barry's own distinctive musical motifs and style once again lending credence that this is the definitive Bond film when combined with all the other superlative elements presented in GOLDFINGER. The "Bond Girls" and their specific role in the Bond formula are best represented yet uniquely presented in GOLDFINGER seeing that the formula in this film is tweaked a bit. Usually the formula dictates that Bond has one leading female partner who accompanies him on and off during his exploits. There is also the sacrificial lamb that becomes sexually involved with Bond but along the way pays the ultimate sacrifice, which only intensifies Bond's resolve to vanquish the villain. Also, there may be a female villain who Bond also becomes sexually involved in and her fate varies from film to film. GOLDFINGER as a film stands on its own. It is good filmmaking. As a James Bond film it could easily be considered the best of the series.</p></body></html>

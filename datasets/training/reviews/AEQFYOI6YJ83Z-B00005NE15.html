<meta name="summary" content="One of the creepiest and most shocking horror movies ever!"></head><body><p>Antonio Bay is a small town by the sea, with a deadly past.  The town's Founding Fathers, in an effort to gain money to build their new town, caused the wreck of a ship carrying gold.  They thought they could put the past behind them.  They were wrong.<br /><br />A fog is slowly creeping into town.  With it come menacing figures...the ghosts of the dead sailors.  They want their revenge.  Six sacrifices, and the return of their gold.  And if they do not get this...then there will be hell to pay in Antonio Bay.  And not even God will be able to help them.<br /><br />Staring Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh (the two, by the way, do NOT play mother-daughter characters), Nick Castle, and Hal Holbrook as a brooding and creepy Father Malone, "The Fog" is one of those great horror movies that doesn't involve much violence or gore (though there are indeed some shocking scenes); what's frightening is what you don't see, and what you are afraid of.  With great casting and directing by John Carpenter, this is a horror film fans of the genre cannot afford to miss.</p></body></html>

Or tearing their heads off? Makes no sense to me. Wouldn't they just regenerate? The first 30 mins of this silly dark and dreary mess are a complete muddle for non-experts. Having not seen any of this series before, I was lost. Not good. If you are making these, anyone should be able to drop in and make sense of it from the start. This needed better editing and/or a better script. But in the makers' zeal to make everything here move incredibly fast, they lost track of storyline. To be fair, the plot and the characters manage to sort of come together after awhile. The color of this is almost all blue and black and white. Very dark. I also don't get why something called UV bullets can slow down these immortals. Aren't they supposedly indestructible? Haven't they been around for centuries? Yet, here they can suddenly be destroyed. HHmmmm.....</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A VISUAL, AND EMOTIONAL FEAST"></head><body><p>THE ILLUSIONIST is at once a sumptuously visual fairy tale, a very delectable love story, and a thought-provoking mystery. The Philip Glass score is haunting, and mesmerizing, the colors, fluid, and lush, and the romance is breathtaking, and extroadinarily sensual without relying on bare bodies. Edward Norton is remarkably effective as the master magician Eisenheim, and Jessica Biel is luminous as Duchess Sophie, the love of his life. The story, romance, and mystery unfold with almost dream-like resonance, and is by turns lyrical, exquisitely passionate, and intoxicatingly heartrending.<br /><br />The story takes place in late 19th century Austria. The illusionist, Eisenheim (Norton) returns to his homeland in time to find his childhood sweetheart on the verge of marrying one of the most powerful men in Europe, the meglomaniacal, Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell). The prince brings his bride-to-be, Duchess Sophie (Biel) to the theater that the magician is performing in. Eisenheim recognizes her immediately. Sophie, upon realizing who Eisenheim is, arranges a rather innocent tryst with the magician. Chief Inspector Uhl (the wonderful, Paul Giammati), has, unfortunately had them followed, as part of his duty to the crown, and the real mystery begins.<br /><br />The acting is exceptional, the direction superb, and the music sublime.<br />It is, simply put, one of the most beautiful films I have had the pleasure of seeing in my lifetime.</p></body></html>

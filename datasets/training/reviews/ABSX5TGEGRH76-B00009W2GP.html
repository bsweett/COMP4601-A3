It had a great plot, amazing special effects, great characters, and sufficient acting ability.  The Matrix Reloaded was okay.  Many of the interesting characters who had died in the first movie were replaced by one-dimensional characters that most people didn't give a darn about.  The effects were better, but they were unable to make up for the lack of overall story and acting.  The Matrix Revolutions suffers from the exact same problem.  The characters are still annoying, there is even less plot (this whole movie takes place in the span of about a day), and it seems that Keanu Reeves' acting ability actually decreased.<br /><br />Anyway, this movie picks up exactly where Reloaded ended; Neo (Reeves) is in a coma (sort of) along with Bane/Smith (Ian Bliss).  Smith, after taking over Bane's body, exited the matrix.  Now, his consciousness (or soul) is inhabiting the body of freedom fighter Bane.  Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburn) is still in shock after learning that the prophecy isn't true, or it isn't in the way he had believed it to be.  Finally, the army of sentinals is minutes away from breaching Zion, the last human city.  After Neo awakens, he and Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) take a ship to the Machine City to end the war while Morpheus, Niobe (Jada Pincket Smith) et. al. return to Zion to help fight.  Neo makes a deal with the machines: Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) has become a virus that the matrix can't even control anymore.  Smith is a self-replicating program that is causing a lot of problems for the machines.  If Neo destroys Smith, the war will end.<br /><br />The only truly good thing about this movie is the final fight between Smith and Neo.  The APU's (which resemble Mech Warriors) are cool, but that scene is way too long.  The acting is terrible, save Ian Bliss who had to portray the Agent Smith character, and he did it very well.  This movie was also very confusing.  In the first Matrix, there were lines that were cryptic, but they made sense.  In this one and Reloaded, I think that the writers just threw stuff in because it either sounded cool or they had no idea either, so they hoped that viewers would just "go with it".  One thing they handled terribly was the Oracle's (Mary Alice) change in appearance.  Gloria Foster, the woman who played the oracle in the two previous movies, died before this movie was filmed, so she had to be replaced.  All they had to say was that there was a change in the matrix, but instead, they came up with a really confusing and hokey explanation.<br /><br />Also, in the first movie, the allusions to the fact that Neo was a Christ-like character were subtle.  In Reloaded and especially this movie, they really lay it on thick.  After a while, it got a little old.  I mean, when Neo was jacked in by the machines, his body formed a cross, Smith was literally the Anti-Neo, he converted people's souls (in a sense), and, well I can't reveal the really big allusion.<br /><br />In conclusion, I will say this: if you really, really like the Matrix movies, you should see this one only to see how everything ends.  If not, don't waste your time.  Also, don't let this review stop you from seeing the first Matrix.  It is a great movie, and, in my opinion, can stand pretty well on its own.<br /><br />P.S.<br /><br />Did anyone else notice that, during the final battle, after Smith and Neo collided mid-air and created that huge water sphere, Smith looked like Ganondorf in Legend of Zelda: Occarina of Time?  After Link and Zelda escape the castle, Ganondorf rises up and floats in the air (like Smith) and becomes Ganon.  Their facial expressions and positions of limbs are nearly identical.  Also, Link and Ganondorf were also opposites in the same way Neo and Smith are.  Just wondering.</p></body></html>

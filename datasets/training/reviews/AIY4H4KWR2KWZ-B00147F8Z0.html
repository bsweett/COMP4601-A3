The flick's problems were numerous, but unlike the nasty Geiger-inspired creatures, fairly inocuous.<br /><br />The largest issue: The screenplay wasn't particularly well developed. We're given too many 'lead' characters, and as an audience we're forced to parcel out our interests, making our emotional investments superficial at best. The characters end up as a laundry list of who lives/dies -versus- people that we want to see make it to the end. A stronger focus utilizing fewer players would have helped this flick enormously. Additionally, the dialogue and character interplay was paper-thin, lending itself to clich&eacute;.<br /><br />From a technical aspect, scenes showcasing the Aliens were under-lit and visually muddy. Darkness for the creepy factor is understandable, but we're suppose to be able to make out what we're watching. It was extremely difficult to decipher several of the battle sequences, so it missed the foremost goal of this franchise = enjoying these two creatures kick the crap out of each other.<br /><br />Plus, I found it tacky that the Strause Brothers decided on heavy rain to illicit drama. It's such a tired ploy; I wished they would've sacked up and did the special effects in a dry (more revealing) setting. Again, this goes to the battle sequences where it became frustratingly difficult to follow events. It makes me wonder if the F/X crew realized their mechanics were visible during the test shots, forcing the directors to shoot the film that way? In fact, I honestly had no idea until nearly the end of the film (again - too dark) that the primary freak was an Alien/Predator hybrid. And just how did that happen?!<br /><br />Finally, I wish they had explained why the alert sent out to the Predator homeworld was received and responded to and by one lone hunter. Was it a partner? Was it a family member? Was the dying Predator part of a specific hunting group - so that only members of that group would've received the call? It wasn't clear and the question lingers when it seemed the lone hunter was clearly overmatched. More so given its desire to hide evidence of the aliens and their victims. If his job was "clean-up", why not have more of them? I've always chalked up the basic premise of the Predator canon that each hunter is glorified by the amount of kills in his trophy case, so by taking on the mission alone, he didn't have to share the spoils. But he wasn't taking any trophies, instead choosing to wipe away evidence of their existence. So why him alone? Character contradiction or plot error - your choice.<br /><br />Still, I fully appreciated the sheer horror. That alone makes this stand out above some of the predecessors and successors to the franchise. Some of the images were truly horrific - more so in the Unrated Version. If the 'yikes' factor plays into your enjoyment, then you'll find a lot of pleasure in several gross out scenes. Personally, I had to look away at the more crazy intense imagery - can't say I enjoy watching pregnant women about to give birth to their human babies being used as instant incubators and a first meal for alien offspring. Bleeping sick stuff.<br /><br />On balance worth a rental for the average (non-fanboy) action/horror category.</p></body></html>

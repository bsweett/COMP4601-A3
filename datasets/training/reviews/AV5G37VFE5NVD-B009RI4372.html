THE EVIL DEAD is a surprisingly good Indie film, gathering inspiration from THE HILLS HAVE EYES, THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (especially), and EQUINOX, and has a place deservedly among those as a milestone of horror films.  <p>Bruce Campbell stars as Ash, a college student who journeys to the woods for a fun-filled weekend in a cabin with his friends (phew).  Soon, however, they learn something is lurking in the woods...and it wants them.  Sexually, physically, and violently, if need be.  <p>Sam Raimi writes and directs this with surprising starter's mastering; Campbell is good, although he'd later be terrific in the sequels, EVIL DEAD II and ARMY OF DARKNESS.  Joseph LoDuca also contributes a good (as well as inspired) score.  Very cool!</p></body></html>

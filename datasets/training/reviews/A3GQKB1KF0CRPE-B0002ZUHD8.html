Oh, please.  Braveheart was a great movie, I love it, but history it ain't!  Whether Arthur the King is or is not faithful to the legend - WHO CARES?  Was any version that has been done on the round table accurate?  I sincerely doubt it.  None come to my mind!  Most Arthurian Legends come from the faerytales of Camelot written in the Middle Ages, by an author who dressed the knights and ladies according to that period.<br /><br />So take a deep breath, sit back and watch the film without hanging onto the romantic images like Linus holds onto his blanket and really watch great storytelling - key words STORY TELLING - in action.  This movie is beautiful filmed, grimly realistic - as Hollywood generally can get.  The wide screen version of the directors cut is magnificent.<br /><br />I really don't see why you have to compare apples or oranges.  I happen to love them both.<br /><br />History it ain't - same as Braveheart, same as Excalibur, same as every Hollywood historical film ever lenses.  When so few historical films are done, its great to see one filmed with such passion, quality and eye for detail.<br /><br />If you want historical Arthur - go seek ye yond history book and MAYBE you will find a trace of him.  Other wise, don't whine this is not accurate.<br /><br />Just enjoy fine storytelling.</p></body></html>

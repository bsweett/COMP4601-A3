<meta name="summary" content="A Jumble of Dummies"></head><body><p>There are some genuinely creepy moments in "Dead Silence." A wide-eyed, wooden dummy in the room is always a source of suspense. The movie gets especially interesting when its protagonist first returns to his hometown of Raven's Fair to bury his wife. Several suggestive scenes there might lead viewers to suspect a truly inventive horror. However these themes aren't developed in any coherent way. They are only explained in slapdash flashback at the end of the film. If they had been made into the concentrated heart of this film, this would have been a superior thriller.<br /><br />As it is though, this movie loses its way in a hodgepodge of ghostly special effects. Avenging spirits are superimposed on all sorts of reanimated entities. It's like "The Shining," which actually was a series of unrelated eerie plot lines paraded across the screen. But this film doesn't have any of The Shining's style or conviction. In fact, James Wan, the Director of "Dead Silence," says in one of the DVD extras that he purposely threw every sinister visual he could think of - except the kitchen sink - into the story. Then when the film was almost complete - he threw in the kitchen sink as well. He boasts about this as if it were a good thing. However in fact, he spoiled his film with a superfluity of the supernatural.<br /><br />In addition, he let too many amateurish performances crowd his scenes. The detective, for example, is very unconvincing.<br /><br />There are perhaps some elements of this film that may haunt you. It features a good warning line that the townspeople repeat - "Beware the stare of Mary Shaw..." This incantation almost rivals the old rhyme that Madam Ouspenskaya recited to Lon Chaney, Jr. to warn him of his werewolf fate. "Even a man who is pure at heart, and says his prayers by night..."<br /><br />On the whole though, there are many better film opportunities to be scared by potentially homicidal ventriloquist's dummies. There is of course Anthony Hopkins' turn in "Magic." However, the most truly frightening take and twist on the theme that I've seen was the Alfred Hitchcock TV episode entitled "The Glass Eye." That episode stars Tom Conway. It first aired in October of 1957 and is available in the complete "Alfred Hitchcock Presents" series.<br /><br />Then if you want to catch a brief spoof of the genre, check out Seinfeld's "The Chicken Roaster" episode from that sitcom's 1996 season. Jerry and Kramer switch apartments and Jerry is left alone with Mr. Marbles, the dummy that Kramer acquired. He pulls the covers up to avoid facing whatever thing goes - not bump - but more ominously yet - pitta-pat, pitta-pat, pitta-pat in the night.</p></body></html>

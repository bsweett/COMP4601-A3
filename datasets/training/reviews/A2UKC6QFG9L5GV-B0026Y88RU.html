<meta name="summary" content="WOW..."></head><body><p>I didn't see this coming. I was expecting some criminal movie a la Guy Ritchie but what I got was a whole lot different. At first it seemed like some average criminal movie: well, Morgan Freeman and Ben Kingsley as two gang bosses, Bruce Willis as a hitman, Stanley Tucci as a cop, Lucy Liu as a hot autopsist and goofy Josh Hartnett in between - it was fun. Especially with funny lines like: "Why do everyone call him rabbi?" - "Because he's a rabbi..."<br /><br />It was closer to the end when I realized the film was not what it seemed to be. And to be more precise - it was not what it pretended to seem to be. Just like with Paul McGuigan's last flick "Wicker Park". Remember watching it and then gasping at one point: "Wow"? Same thing happened to me here and I must say McGuigan is a hell of a director. He is pulling the wool over our eyes during the whole movie just to come up with such a twist in the end we will not know what to say.<br /><br />And even when it looks like an ordinary story which we saw a lot already, it looks good. Because of the fine acting, sharp directing, brilliant screen-play with smart and ironic dialogs... You don't get a feeling the movie is played out and second hand. It's indeed fresh, it tastes and smells delicious. It's light and it melts in your mouth.<br /><br />In a way after I exhaled that "Wow" after finished watching the first thought that came to my mind was: "It's the second "Usual Suspects". I wouldn't actually insist it is so but when you watch it you'll get me. By the way if I were you I wouldn't read anything about "Lucky Number Slevin" before watching, no reviews or annotations. I wouldn't ask friends who saw it about it. Don't try to learn anything about this film beforehand even if those are some insignificant details. And stop reading this also (I'm shutting up at last) - go and watch!</p></body></html>

I fully believe that the shock of who the killer goes in the book as one of the best twists in movie history, such as what is learned in the Star Wars movies. The movie itself is really well done, but the musical score takes it to another level and adds so much more horror in it. You can't hear that song at night and not be a little scared, it is one of those songs that puts a chill on the bones when it is heard. The first person view the camera takes as it sees through the eyes of the murderer is really well done, and so are the death scenes. Overall, this is a movie that just doesn't get old not matter how many times I watch it.</p></body></html>

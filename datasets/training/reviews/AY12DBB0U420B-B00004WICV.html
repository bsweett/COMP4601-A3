<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Movie. Well Done."></head><body><p>My bargain-rack DVD movie for last night was "The Green Mile." I found it on the Wal-Mart five-dollar rack. It was quite an excellent movie and the best part was the acting. All of the characters really came to life and you loved them or hated them. I understand it got four Academy Award nominations. Mr. Jingles ought to get an award of his own.<br /><br />The Green Mile is the walkway in the hall of the death row at a major prison. Tom Hanks is the man in charge. All of the prisoners await their journey. Some are quite likable people. Some are despicable. Same with the guards who are in charge. Mr. Jingles is a mouse who lives in the corridor and is befriended by one of the inmates. It seems like a pretty simple setting but a lot of drama is involved in the dynamics of the situation and this is the best movie in which I've ever seen Tom Hanks. The acting, direction and filming are all first rate. Well done!<br /><br />My inclination would be to give the movie five stars, without reservation, except for one factor. I didn't like the hocus-pocus of the miraculous healings. This type of supernatural nonsense tainted an otherwise outstanding movie, in my opinion. I have no alternate suggestion. The fault lies not with the movie or it's production, but with the author of the story. If you can somehow get around this built-in problem, or somehow suspend your otherwise rational beliefs, you'll find the movie to be a five-star effort on the part of all concerned.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Amazing movie!"></head><body><p>Possibly one of the best movies ever made.  The origional 33 version has always been the best, Kong is more of a beast, true he has a soft side for the blonde of his dreams.  But the new 2005 version has a more passive Kong than this origional.  But what am i saying the origionals are always better.  This is Kong remastered as you've never seen it before, amazing set amazing movie!</p></body></html>

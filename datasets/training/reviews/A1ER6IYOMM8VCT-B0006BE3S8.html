All things considered they have come up with a story that works to bring the two classic creatures together to do battle in this fun action flick!<br /><br />I love movies and appreciate great works of art in film. I also am not above loving a good popcorn flick! Movies are here for our enjoyment, but unfortunately, some people are so pompous they forget what it's all about! ....... entertainment! I'm not knocking world class films like Gone With The Wind, Citizen Kane, The Godfather etc..etc., but all films don't have to be so profound......do they?<br /><br />This gimmick is no different than what was done in the 40's when classic films like 'Frankenstein' and 'The Bride Of Frankenstein' had sequels like 'Frankenstein meets the Wolfman'! Although it's not a classic, it's still a memorable and fun movie.<br /><br />These films don't destroy what was great about the classic, they actually pay great respect...a homage if you will to the original. If you don't like these films....fine, but for me I have to admit I enjoy them ...if done right. The unrated version is the best version I've seen and this film edges out the sequel, mostly because you can see all the action! Grab some popcorn and a beer and watch this Sci-Fi Battle Royal!</p></body></html>

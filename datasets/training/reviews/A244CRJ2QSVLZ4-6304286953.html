<meta name="summary" content="I Visited England And All I Got Was This Stupid Werewolf Bite (Now Everyone Around Me Is Being Torn Apart!)"></head><body><p>"An American Werewolf In London" is an expertly crafted horror classic.  It is one of my favorite werewolf films for numerous reasons:  It was written and directed by John Landis who also gave us the late Michael Jackson's "Thriller" video.  Davis Kessler`s (David Naughton) transformation into the werewolf was created by makeup artist Rick Baker who also worked on Eddie Murphy`s "The Nutty Professor" and Tim Burton's "Planet of the Apes."  The scenes on the Welsh moors were very eerie and gothic; they were reminiscent of the horror films produced by Hammer in the late fifties to early seventies.  Gorgeous Jenny Agutter of "Logan's Run" fame is perfect as the beautiful Nurse Alex Price who falls in love with the horrible beast that is terrorizing London.  Alas, as in so many other films of this nature (such as "King Kong") beauty can never have the beast.<br /><br />  Normally, I don't like humor mixed in with my horror.  However, due to Landis' superb direction, the humor doesn't distract from the horror.  My favorite scene:  When the werewolf breaks out of the porn theatre in Picadilly Circus; mayhem and panic ensue.  "An American Werewolf in London" has a high body count that will not disappoint.  It rivals "The Howling" - another classic that was released the same year.  Wes Craven's "Cursed" - a mystery slasher involving a werewolf - is also recommended.  For connoisseurs of the classic horror films, Hammer's "Curse of the Werewolf," starring a young, dashing Oliver Reed, is a must see.  Also, if you enjoy a lot of violence and gore, "Dog Soldiers" may be the ticket for you.<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos</p></body></html>

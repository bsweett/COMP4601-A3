<meta name="summary" content="Shockingly bad"></head><body><p>I am surprised how highly praised this film is ... I thought it was bad.  Shockingly bad because there are so many great actors in this film: Philip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Albert Finney, and even a little Rosemary Harris.<br /><br />It was weird, yet intriguing in its stylized design.  The family dynamic was also interesting to watch as it unfolded.  But you could never truly connect to these characters or their problems, because you never truly understood them.  The scenes are just short snippets.  Even so, this is not a flaw, but rather just a detached film.<br /><br />The plot is weak; leading me to believe the dynamic style was an attempt to cover up a rather mundane, short, predictable film.  Two brothers plot to rob their parent's suburban shopping mall jewelry store, when things suddenly fall apart.  The rest of the film is a flashback/forward of each character's take on the robbery, its precedents, and its aftermath.  The acting is not necessarily bad, but it definitely is not good.  Ethan Hawke and Philip Seymour Hoffman do a convincing job, but they cannot save this hopeless film.<br /><br />Marisa Tomei is a huge disappointment.  Apparently this was a low budget film because there was not enough money to buy her a decent wardrobe (she likes to spend several prolonged, and unnecessary scenes naked or nearly so).  What happened to her career?  This is a sad film for her most of all.  Unless you really like one of these actors, or love Sidney Lumet, I would not waste your time on this film.  Truly disappointed.</p></body></html>

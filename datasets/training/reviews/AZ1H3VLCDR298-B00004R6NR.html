<meta name="summary" content="Jurassic Park on DVD? And you're stil reading this?"></head><body><p>Jurassic Park is one of the biggest movies of all time, brought to us by Steven Spielberg and the incredible wizkids at Industrial Light and Magic. The movie inspired awe in anyone who first saw it in the theatres. this was the first time we have seen a REAL looking dino on the big screen. Richard Attenborough is a rich man who creates an island theme park full of cloned dinosaurs, and is one of the first films to deal with the serious issue of cloning. He invites a team of scientists to sign off on the island, which includes Sam Neill and Laura Dern as paleontologists as well as a mathamatician, played by Jeff Goldblum, and Attenboroughs 2 grandkids. Of course, the park breaks down, and the dinosaurs run amok, creating some of the best scenes in movie history. The special effects are good to this day, especially with the crisp clarity of the DVD picture and OUTSTANDING sound. There is also a load of extras, including trailers for all 3 films.</p></body></html>

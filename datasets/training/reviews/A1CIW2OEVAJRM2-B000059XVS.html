Lawrence (d. 1935).  Lawrence was sent to Arabia during the First World War, and successfully operated behind enemy lines to unite various Arab tribes in guerrilla warfare against the Turks.  The movie focuses on Lawrence's fiercely independent and enigmatic spirit, which rebelled against the British regime under which he served, yet enabled him to be successful in his mission.  Lawrence does not share British colonist ambitions in Arabia but has his own agenda.  Lawrence goes against the grain by treating the Arabs with respect, despite their unfamiliarity with the guns, machines and bombs of modern warfare, and successfully forges important alliances with their leaders.  He secures their enduring respect and near religious devotion by risking his life for others, and accomplishing the impossible.  In the end, the question "Who are you?" is of deep significance: is Lawrence British or is he Arab?<p>Despite the World War I context, the movie doesn't focus on battle scenes, because most of the conflict is psychological or against the elements.  Lawrence's own character struggles and development are the focus, as is his interaction with Arab and British leaders.  But Lawrence's struggle is not only against a human enemy, but also equally against the hostile desert landscape.  With epic cinematography that leaves you feeling the desert wind and heat, viewers feel exposed to the elements as Lawrence was.  The fierce conditions in the desert and wild passions of the Arabs are wonderfully contrasted with the strict military discipline of the British army at their base with their generals sipping tea, and priding themselves in mundane achievements ("We've just built a new squash court").  There are a few battles scenes, featuring thunderous hooves, rifle shots, and war whoops, in an epic sequences involving thousands of men, camels and horses.  There are also a few scenes of violence and death (including execution, torture, and a massacre) that would be disturbing to children (they were disturbing to Lawrence!).  It was widely believed that Lawrence was homosexual, and there are a couple of aspects in the movie that could be interpreted as having homosexual overtones.  But on the whole the movie is about the man Lawrence, his passions and eccentric personality.  Lawrence's prime character trait was an ego that was bigger than he was, and this arrogant pride eventually destroyed him.<p>The change in Lawrence's character after he is tortured is somewhat sudden and hard to follow, as the man who was previously afraid of blood now shocks his men by ordering them to massacre a column of retreating Turks.  But this aside, it's a wonderful movie with adventure, epic sequences, extraordinary scenery, and good characterization. It still stands up remarkably well after more than 40 years, because never do you have the feeling that you are watching something thoroughly outdated.  Considering that the movie weighs in at well over three and a half hours, it's also lengthy.  Remarkably, there are no girls and no love story, but it works.  Most memorable are portrait of the man Lawrence (Peter O'Toole was relatively unknown prior to this film, but produced an immense performance in the starring role) and the spectacle of the harsh desert scenery (no doubt best viewed on the big screen!).  The passion of the characters, conflicts and cinematography are as powerful today as they were in 1962.  It's no wonder that this movie won seven Academy Awards in its time, and thirty years later is still regarded by many as one of the top ten of all time movie classics.  It may not be entirely accurate in its depiction of the history (the portrayal of Lawrence was sharply criticized by his family, and the depiction of Arabs is somewhat stereotyped).  But even if it's somewhat of a mirage, this classic is worth digging up from the desert of the past to watch all over again.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="SPOILER - A stupid film, unimaginative, badly written... with barely one good idea."></head><body><p>This film has some cult following. And I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Basically, this is just a "one-idea-film" that would have made a GREAT short feature. Instead, they stretched it into a feature film.<br /><br />And it is all offensively idiotic.<br /><br />1 - Lola is at home. Her boyfriend calls her and explains his problem: he forgot some gangster's money on the subway... and some homeless guy found it.<br /><br />This gives birth to one of the most uninspired explanation scenes in movie History. Who's the bad guy, what was the money for, what will happen if he does not get it back, etc... one stupid phone call that lasts forever with Lola and her dumb boyfriend talking... and talking... and talking...<br /><br />Halfway through their ridiculous conversation, I'm already thinking: "this guy is sooo stupid and incompetent that I DO WANT him to get killed! I hope Lola gives him the boot!"<br /><br />But she doesn't. Instead, when he says something idiot like "help me or I'll just rob the supermarket close to this phone booth" (to which I'd simply reply "do it, you stupid punk. Then drop dead!") she just says "I'll be there in twenty minutes and I'll think of something. Don't do anything stupid!" - like if that wasn't the rule so far... LOL<br /><br />Then I started thinking: "Wow, I can't wait to find out what will she do in order to get the money. I hope she'll do something brilliant".<br /><br />And what does she do? She runs aaaaallllll the way from home to the bank where her dad works. Exactly: the "running" you see on the title is to daddy!!!<br /><br />Hello!! Can't we be brilliant and creative?<br />No.<br /><br />Daddy (by far the most fascinating character in this film) gives her the boot (hurray!). And she does not get the money. When she meets her stupid boyfriend, the moron is already robbing the supermarket. She helps him and (guess what?!?!?) she gets killed by the police on the way out.<br /><br />What follows next is (we go back in time) a long and boring bed scene (put there to make some time - so this can be a feature film) where the two lovers are talking... and talking... and talking... for almost 8 minutes things like "do you love me?" "Yes" "How much?" "A lot" "Are you sure?" "I guess so" "So you are not sure?" "I am" "what would you do if I'd die?" "I don't know"... -things like that.<br /><br />...No wonder why teenagers love this. This is bad teenager screenwriting.<br /><br />And then we see two variations of the same story:<br /><br />B) Lola goes to dad and ends up robbing the bank. She gets the money, but this time it is her boyfriend who gets killed (hit by an ambulance).<br /><br />C)Lola goes to the bank but takes a while longer to get there. Does not find dad and goes to a casino (A CASINO!!!!) that just happens to be there where she gambles some change money and wins all the money she needs... -talk about deus-ex-machina.<br /><br />Is this supposed to be a masterpiece?<br />Would someone please explain to me, like if I were a four-year-old child, why is this film so praised.<br /><br />I do not get it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The time, the place and the music of the 70s recaptured"></head><body><p>This original screenplay won an academy award this year and I can understand why.  There's a lot of heart in it as it's based on the writer/director Cameron Crowe's own experience as a teenage writer for Rolling Stone Magazine.  <p>The young Patrick Fugit is cast as William Miller,  the 15-year-old reporter who, with a combination of pluck and luck manages to get an assignment to write about the fictional rock band, Stillwater.  He's a true innocent and plays the role with wide-eyed wonder as he winds up traveling with the band, much to the upset of his mother, played by Frances McDormand.  Billy Crudup, with his chiseled good looks plays the lead guitarist of the band and his role goes beyond the stereotype of a rock musician.  And then there is the lovely Kate Hudson, who adds sparkle and sensitivity to her role as a groupie.  William Seymour Hoffman also adds his talents as the writer/rock critic who the young William looks up to as his mentor.  It's a great cast.<p>The best part of this film, though,  was the way the screenplay captured the time and place of the rock music scene of the 70s.  Some of the music was original and some were old favorites such as &quot;America&quot; by Simon and Garfunkel, &quot;Every Picture tells a Story&quot; by Rod Stewart and :The Wind&quot; by Cat Stevens.  The details were all there -- the attitude, clothing, and youthful energy that was so much a part of the times.  I couldn't help but notice though that even though drugs were talked about, there wasn't much on-screen drug use. This is to the film's credit which was, basically, about the relationships between the people as well as the music.<p>The world that this film captures so well is long gone.  The characters have grown up and the young reporter is now a successful Hollywood screenwriter. The intensity of the times have faded and we now live in a world of computers and cell phones.  What a delight it was though to again feel the pulse of the 70s and hear the music once again.</p></body></html>

The director had the great common sense to cast two of my favorite women, Kate Beckinsale and Josie Maran (although Maran was skewered way too soon). Hugh Jackman is the right amount of charm and strength to pull off the character... and finally... it looks good. The special effects are fantastic.<br /><br />YET!! This movie... about VAMPIRES, FRANKENSTEIN, WEREWOLVES and DR. JEKYLL and MR. HYDE isn't even remotely REMOTELY scary. Not a sliver.<br /><br />Which is completely and squarely placed on the shoulders of Director Stephen Sommers. Which, and I could see it coming a mile away, also directed The Mummy, which also wasn't scary.<br /><br />And you know what... I don't think it was intended to be scary when they went into production... which makes it even worse.<br /><br />Before going to see this movie, I was completely aware of the downfall I would soon become fully aware of. The movie wouldn't be scary. It wouldn't be dark and risky. It would be a comedy with cool special effects.<br /><br />WHAT!! How can you pool the great monsters of our time and NOT KNOW YOU HAVE TO AT LEAST ATTEMPT TO MAKE THE MOVIE SOMEWHAT SCARY!<br /><br />Yet the Beckinsale/Maran factor drug me into the theatre and my preconceived notion was absolutely correct...<br /><br />Ho. Hum. If you like special effect popcorn movies. Don't like to be too mentally challenged when you're watching a movie and like a mild chuckle here and there, then this is your kind of movie.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when it comes to Dracula, Werewolf and Frankenstein... I wanted to be scared, wanted to be CHALLENGED and wanted to see something that I've never seen before.<br /><br />Well, that didn't happen.</p></body></html>

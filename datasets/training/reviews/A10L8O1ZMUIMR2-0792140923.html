<meta name="summary" content="A True American Movie Masterpiece"></head><body><p>This is a truely amazing and magical movie and most people wonder why. It makes you feel good inside. Forrest Gump makes his way into all of our hearts by weaving himself into real American events so that we can relate to him. An innocent man sitting on a bench telling the story of his life. He may not be all there, but he touches all of our hearts. The music adds to the film a lot, being timed in with what's going on. It tells the tale of a man's life, and how he changed America. Tom Hanks brings so much to the role of Forrest, being able to express many emotions and feelings. The DVD is really good, great everything. I wouldn't even think about complaining at all. Forrest Gump is a role model for all things good, and shouldn't be missed by anyone.</p></body></html>

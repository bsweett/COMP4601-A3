<meta name="summary" content="Remake is better than the original, and original was awesome !"></head><body><p>Sometimes I do not like remakes, but I absolutely LOVED this one !<br /><br />Although the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre is good, it has become outdated, even the picture and sound are... old.<br /><br />Just the all around feel of the picture was SCREAMING remake!<br /><br />And they did it BETTER than the original !<br /><br />The whole thing gets a new facelift. From the fresh new faces, to the much scarier, bloodier, and all this with a much better quality of picture, sound, better director..everything is just better across the board.<br /><br />One example is how the film opens.In the original, they pick up a hitch hiker, and he is part of the family..He cuts his hand, they freak out, and kick him out of the van.<br /><br />The remake, they are also in a van, they almost run over a girl in the road who has escaped from the hell house, they pick her up, she blows her brains out in thier van,(This is gross) they go find the sherriff, and the horror begins.<br /><br />The second scenario is MUCH scarier to me, than a crazy just cutting his hand, and on and on it goes...<br /><br />The whole film is scarier, and has a more menacing feel to it, and thats a GOOD thing if you are a fan of hard core horror.<br /><br />I have only one complaint , that at the end of the movie, Erin rescues the baby, and NOT the little monkey boy who helps them escape.<br /><br />If you have never seen the remake version, DO see it,  I guarantee you will be more scared :)</p></body></html>

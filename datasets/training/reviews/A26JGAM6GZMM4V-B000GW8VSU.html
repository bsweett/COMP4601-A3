<meta name="summary" content="Let's all review this film"></head><body><p>Comparisons and contrasts between this film and its predecessor of the same name directed by John Frankenheimer (1962) are inevitable. Both were based on Richard Condon's novel (1959), although it seems to me that this remake owes more to George Axelrod's screenplay for the original film. The comments which follow, however, are limited to the 2004 version directed by Jonathan Demme and co-starring Merl Streep (as Eleanor Shaw), Denzel Washington (as Captain Bennett Marco), and Liev Schreiber (as Raymond Shaw). Although their performances as well as those of a few others in supporting roles (notably Jon Voight, Kimberly Elise, and Simon McBurney) are first-rate, I think this film has serious flaws.<br /><br />Here are four. First, the implausible, at times cartoonish "villains." Specifically,the senior-level executives of Manchurian Global corporation who have devised and then implemented a plan by which to gain and then sustain total control of the President of the United States by placing their candidate, Raymond Shaw, in the Oval Office. He is a recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor for heroism during Operation Desert Storm. What is their motive? What else? Potentially trillions of dollars from sales worldwide of military products and paramilitary services. I also had problems with the narrative which suffers from confusing  transitions from the past to the present to the past and from one location to another. My next criticism concerns Demme's ineffective use of what could be called the "Mad Scientist" device, in this instance Dr. Noyle. He is an infamous geneticist whom foreign countries as well as multinational corporations hire to conduct human implant procedures "by which to gain and then sustain total control of...." You get the idea. I just wish Demme had developed the Noyle character as brilliantly as he did  Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lams (1991). For me, the most serious flaw is the dysfunctional coda which I will not discuss out of respect for those who have not as yet seen this film. I will suggest, however, that it raises more questions than it answers.<br /><br />As Eleanor Shaw, Streep dominates every scene in which she appears. Near the end of the film, there is one with her son Raymond which suggests all of the passions which have driven her, probably for decades. Washington does the best he can with what is, as presented, a muddled character. He communicates intensity better than almost any other actor since Rod Steiger in his prime. As Marco, he also communicates torment. As for Schreiber, I think his is the most difficult character to portray because, pre-implant, Raymond Shaw was an especially unlikeable person. Post-implant, although in many ways still unlikeable, he is nonetheless a victim who is never permitted to deviate from the assignment for which he has been so thoroughly, scientifically prepared. There are brief (albeit subtle) indications of Raymond's humanity as when he is obviously pleased to see Jocelyn Jordan (Vera Farmiga) again and then later when he begins to realize that Marco's various suspicions may indeed be true.<br /><br />For the reasons indicated, I think Demme and his associates created a film which lacks both thematic cohesion and dramatic impact. It is OK but....</p></body></html>

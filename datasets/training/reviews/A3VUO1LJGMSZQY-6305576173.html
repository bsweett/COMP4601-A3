<meta name="summary" content="Fine DVD quality"></head><body><p>Just a few comments RE: dvd. For new fans, this is a black/white film, despite colorized dvd packaging and colorized 'stills' (above). Revisited this film just today (toying with blu upgrade) and found dvd to be just fine, IMHO. Audio/visuals still effective (and just musing, but is it right to expect the film to look better than in '74?). So, instead of double-dipping, will now look for original Frankenstein, and do the inevitable comparisons! (Features of dvd: 41 min. 'making of', several deleted scenes, and interesting set of short Mexican interviews, of Feldman, Wilder/Leachman. Subtitles in eng, spa, fr). A great film is a great film, no matter vhs, dvd, or blu!</p></body></html>

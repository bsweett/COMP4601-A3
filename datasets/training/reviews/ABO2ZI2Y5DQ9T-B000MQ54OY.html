<meta name="summary" content="(3.5 STARS) Entertaining and Unpredictable, But Film's Uniqueness May Not Exactly Be What You're Looking for"></head><body><p>"Happy Feet," Oscar-winner for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year 2006, is directed by George Miller, who has helmed "Babe: Pig in the City" as director. Remember this because despite the cute, cuddly face of a baby penguin you might be looking at in the film's poster or DVD jacket, the film itself looks odd at times, like the adventures of the little pig in the strange town. I'm not saying that "Happy Feet" (or the sequel of "Babe") is bad. I'm just saying that you might not find what you think you will find in "Happy Feet."<br /><br />The film starts like a musical parody of "March of the Penguin," a recent hit documentary about the life of Emperor Penguins. Lots of penguins are singing, and among them you meet a male penguin `Memphis' (read Elvis) and Norma Jean (read Marilyn). They fell for each other and ... well, you know the rest of the story. Baby boy penguin Mumble is born, who is a terrible singer, but a fantastic dancer with `happy feet.' Ironically his enormous talent is not wanted in the colony he belongs to.<br /><br />The first part looks like a strange mixture of musical version of nature programs and "Planet of the Apes." Ruling elders does not like Mumble and his dancing, which they consider a threat to their colony. His mother is more understanding than his father who looks worried, or worse, embarrassed at his son's behaviors.<br /><br />The visuals are always impressive, and the songs are provided liberally (including the cover version of Prince, Frank Sinatra, the Beatles, etc) and the chase scenes are thrilling, maybe too thrilling for some kids.<br /><br />I said you know the rest of the story before. Actually, you don't. Typical story of `finding my own place' with a love interest and comic relief turns into something different in the second half, which is more ambitious than the entire story of "Finding Nemo" and more serious and even weird than you expect from any animated films produced in Hollywood. All I can say is that it includes certain messages about the Earth, or in a nutshell, Mumble's "Happy Feet" saves the world.<br /><br />The voice cast is great, including Elijah Wood as Mumble, Brittany Murphy, Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman, Hugo Weaving, Elizabeth Daily, Magda Szubanski, Miriam Margolyes and Robin Williams. It is, however, a bit strange to see and hear a penguin with Elijah Wood's eyes speaking in Elijah Wood's voice. Seeing penguins with voices of Nicole Kidman or Brittany Murphy shaking and wiggling their body is not surely what many of us would expect from the title "Happy Feet." It is also reported that Tony winner Savion Glover is hired to shoot the tap dance scenes of the penguin with motion capture device on his body. All you see is, however, animated penguins, of which superhuman dancing ability is, after all, computer graphics, not the real human.<br /><br />"Happy Feet" is really a mixed bag. Those who love the comedies of scene stealing (or annoying, if you like) double roles by Robin Williams would find the film's second part very bizarre. Some would find the images of penguins and other creature a bit too realistic, even grotesque. Like he did in the second "Babe" George Miller finds originality in the places where few other directors would explore, but I am not perfectly certain that disco music/dancing and environmental messages are the right place. "Happy Feet" is fun, to be sure, but sorry, to me the best animated film on penguins is still "Madagascar" and its penguin gang.</p></body></html>

The March of the Penguins is an amazing film, not just because you're constantly wondering how director Luc Jacquet's devoted team can actually pull off capturing a series of amazing close up shots, but also because you come to the realization that the life of a penguin is fraught with heartache, loss, and the difficulties of trying to survive in such a harshly cold climate.<br /><br />Narrated with customary preternatural calm by Morgan Freeman, this short, simple, and gorgeously photographed film follows the birds as they undertake a 70-mile trek from the sea and the source of the food to their breeding grounds, where they must find a mate, lay the egg, somehow keeping it warm against the brutal conditions, march back to an ice break to get food, hike back to the breeding grounds to feed the little ones, and fend off predators and the elements in the process.<br /><br />It's all a race against time to become organized and get the egg, and later the baby, sheltered from the terrible winter snowstorms that come sweeping over the land. Some of the eggs are exposed to the elements and don't make it, and some females never make it back, dooming the chicks. But the beauty of this movie is that it never shies away from the painful realities of living in this harsh natural world.<br /><br />Penguins make consummate, gender-emancipated parents, with mothers making the first slog, the 70 miles back and forth from the sea to forage for food, while the fathers huddle for warmth and guard the eggs. They are monogamous, for at least time it takes to take care of the chick, with their lovemaking, both lyrical and touching. Their grief when an egg or a baby dies almost unbearable, and one bereft mother's ill-fated attempt to steal a chick from another is absolutely heart trenching.<br /><br />Nature plays both devil and angel in the doggedly instinctual lives of these beautiful animals, and it's a world where divorce is never an option, at least until the chicks are self sufficient and can finally go their own way. Complete with a haunting and symphonic musical score, Luc Jacquet's film is an amazing journey of resilience and hope. Penguins have been captured on camera before, but never with quite the depth and surreal beauty that Jacquet manages to capture here. Mike Leonard December 05.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Quite Good"></head><body><p>First of all, Spanglish not a manic, goofy, insane comedy like Adam Sandler usually pulls out.<br /><br />It is actually a Romantic Comedy.<br /><br />It is a chick flick in some ways, but actually enjoyable for most guys too, "unless you are on a Vin Diesel kick."<br /><br />A pretty good film with good morals and some fun moments.</p></body></html>

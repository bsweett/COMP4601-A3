<meta name="summary" content="Monsters Inc"></head><body><p>Monsters Inc is another great hit from the Disney/Pixar series! Monstaers Inc is about the world of Monsters in our closets and why they come out. In the movie, it's established that a scream will give power and energy, that same power and energy is needed to fuel the city of the Monsters. So like factory clock work, the Monsters go in every morning (night for us humans) and scare people to get that scream.<p>Sully (John Goodman) is the #1 Scarer and his partner Mike (Billy Crystal) is there at his side making sure he catches each scream. Their biggest competition for the #1 slot is Randall (Steve Buscemi). After a night's work, Mike decides to go home and Sully stay behind making sure his paperwork is done and that's when Sully finds Randall cheating and helping his numbers by doing unauthorized scares! Realizing this Sully goes to investigate and finds out that by accident, a little girl has broken into the Monster world! It's up to Sully and Mike to hide her from the authorities and get her home dafely. It's a animaterd comedy adventure that keeps you rolling and brings you to tears.<p>I have to admit, I'm not much of a Disney fan anymore ever since the power days of Disney in the late 80's with the Little Mermaid to 1994's The Lion King, but NOW with these great computer animated full features, I can safely say that I can't wait for Disney to do more of these because there are enjoyable for all ages.<p>Plus the bonus DVD has a lot of great extras in it like the short feature &quot;Mike's New Car&quot;, outtakes and other great features. This is a movie that I'd suggest any family to pop in and have a family movie night. And of course if you're looking for more great Disney/Pixar films, check out TOY STORY and TOY STORY 2 and A BUG'S LIFE. You'll be greatly satisfied. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

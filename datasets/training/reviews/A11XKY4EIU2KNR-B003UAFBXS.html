<meta name="summary" content="Loyalty to Bruce is upping the ratings scale"></head><body><p>I'm a Bruce Campbell fan. Most people who are reviewing this movie are Bruce Campbell fans. People whop've watched this film have done so for one primary reason; Bruce Campbell. SO why can't we be honest? This movie is lousy.<p>Bruce does a great job as an over the hill Elvis. In fact his acting is probably on par or even surpasses anything he's done in his career, to include Ash. But that in itself does not save this film. The story is boring, the movie is boring, and the ending is very anti-climatic. <p>Bruce spends the first half of the move in bed, this goes along with flashbacks explaining how Elvis Presley is still alive.  Eventually he meets up with a black guy who is in fact JFK (along with a bag of sand replacing part of his missing brain). They try to solve the mystery of giant cockroaches and hyrogryphics in the men's room.<p>The final fight is poorly done, and to be blunt, it's boring. By the time the final showdown comes up, you'll wish the movie would just end. It's bad. Bruce has his moments, but for the most part, even the most die-hard Bruce fan will eventually let this movie collect dust. <p>To sum it up, good acting by all involved working with a lame story.</p></body></html>

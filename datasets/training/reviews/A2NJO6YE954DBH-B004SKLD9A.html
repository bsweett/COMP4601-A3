If you have a feeling you are guilty of a crime punishable by death. All the citizens take a mood-limiting drug to go along with the constant brain-washing providing by the single media source and keep everybody in place. Then we have the government officials who are charged with destroying those &quot;sense offenders&quot; who resist the rules, one of whom is one of the chief &quot;clerics,&quot; John Preston (Christian Bale).<br /><br /> To anyone who has read Ray Bradbury's classic dystopian novel &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; the plot line of Kurt Wimmer's 2002 film is familiar. But instead of taking the simple idea of banning books to a logical extreme, Wimmer's world goes for absolutely everything. This means that for the first half of &quot;Equilibrium&quot; I was having a hard time finding mine because I could not believe that the world could really get that far. By what logic do you throw out Da Vinci's &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; along with the photographs of Robert Mapplethorpe, that gets rid of both the Sex Pistols and Ludwig von Beethoven, and prohibits everything from snow globes to puppy dogs? Then, on top of everything, you adopt a symbol that is about a close to a swastika as you can get, like this would also be a good thing in a brave new world.<br /><br /> The assumption has always been that it is the conservatives who are going to turn fascist while the liberals are becoming communists, so for the sake of this film we have to believe in a world where conservatives give up religion, forgo any attempts at Vulcan philosophy and take drugs to curb all feelings (Preston is a &quot;cleric&quot; but there are no signs of anything like a religion beyond the cult like obedience to &quot;Father,&quot; this world's version of &quot;Big Brother,&quot; and the tendency to burn people alive as punishment, which may just be another homage to Bradbury). The point is to curb emotions, yet it would the anger of the righteous that would even attempt to spawn this sort of world in the first place. You tell me that Cleric Brandt (Taye Diggs) is not angry and having other feelings when he he finds out what Preston is really up to. The man SMILES; should they not be shooting everybody who smiles?<br /><br /> Of course this film has to do with Preston, who like Bradbury's Montag becomes intrigued by all that society denies him and then tries to defy the system he has upheld. This is where things get interesting because Preston might be alone but he has the strength of ten men. Well, actually, he acts more like Neo in &quot;The Matrix&quot; movies. You can surround this guy with storm troopers holding guns to his head and he will kill them all. The fights are apparently are example of &quot;Gun-Kata,&quot; that is to say &quot;a martial art completely based around guns,&quot; and they are rather impressive, even by &quot;Matrix&quot; standards. Just do not ask me why anybody needs this much martial arts and weaponry training in a world of drug-induced stupors.<br /><br /> So the trick with &quot;Equilibrium&quot; is to balance the political position of the dystopian elements with the action sequences, in an apparent attempt to keep two very different types of audiences separate. It is rather difficult to enjoy the choreography of the gun battles while trying to deal with the deep philosophical issues that film is trying to raise in between the fights. In the end, what redeems this film somewhat is the end game, where Wimmer's film actually ups the ante and throws in enough twists and turns to make it really interesting. But even then if you do not see the about Father's identity coming then you do not know your classic films and the final sequence says to me that Wimmer is only pretending that he is trying to play on a higher level.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Long on history, short on plot"></head><body><p>There's no doubting Peter Weir's skill as a director, nor the indomitable screen presence of &quot;our Russ&quot; when he arcs up, and &quot;Master and Commander, etc.&quot; offers plenty of opportunities for both of them. What it doesn't offer is a particularly compelling story. The rather thin plot blends two novels by Patrick O'Brian, and most of both of them seems to be missing. This film, I guess, isn't about telling a story - it's about recreating life aboard an English naval vessel in 1805, and on that count it succeeds brilliantly, not only in the vividly realised physical details and extraordinary battles, but in the group psychology of men. Still, the central relationship between Captain Aubrey (Crowe) and the ship's surgeon Stephen Maturin (Bettany) doesn't go much beyond the &quot;morality vs. duty&quot; cliche - the story doesn't give it a chance to. Overall, this isn't a five-star affair. For all its big-budget realization, it offers little more than a good episode of LWT's &quot;Hornblower&quot;. Actually, I think it offers a bit less. Crowe's swashbuckling bravado isn't a patch Ioan Gruffud's vulnerability.</p></body></html>

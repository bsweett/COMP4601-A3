And dontcha came back no more."<br /><br />Funny that no one would dare say such a line toward to a guy like Ray Charles.<br /><br />~REVIEW~<br /><br />Who WAS Ray Charles?  What are the songs he produced?  What's his profile?  The only thing I knew about him is that he invented a new kind of music, and that he was an inspiration to many music artists everywhere.  However, with this movie that came out, those questions should be easily explained in cinema.  Not only does this movie explained the history, but it does it in soulful and energetic way that's gonna rock the Apollo theater.  The movie name says it all, and says it with respect..."Ray."<br /><br />Biography movies are synonymous in the movie industry, and almost each keep following the same chronologically approach that makes it seem effective:  Tina Turner, Selena, Nixon, and Ed Wood, the movies that were about these people's lives follow the same device.  "Ray" fortunately goes on a different direction, in that this movie isn't about the life and death of Ray Charles Robinson, but about how he became a huge success during all that turmoil.  From the early 50s to late 70s, he goes from working at a lowbrow bar in the South (the bar that also had WILLOW!), to having recording deals from Atlantic and ABC, to being banned from Georgia for not playing in a segregated theater.  During these events, along with other events that happened, he was crippling his life on weed and syringes, before he was arrested.<br /><br />"Ray" is great with its effective use of time-shifting.  Whenever there's a certain scene that plays an integral role, it shifts back to a past scenario when Ray was just young child living with a single ma' in a poverty area in Florida.  Each past scenario covers the inspirations on his life, and also, unfortunately for him, his tragedies, but all are just captivating to watch.  In one past scenario, Ray was just blind and when fell down in the house, he cried for his mother's help, while his mother was standing right in front of him 6 feet away, doing nothing.  From then, he started to rely on his other senses, and he got up, and experimented the sound and touch, listening to the noise of a cricket and feeling the things surrounding him.  He noticed mom from the sound of her weeping, crying because he had a special gift.  The scene was so touching, I had trouble bottling in my emotions.  The past tragedies kept robbing him out of his sanity in this movie's present and it was these devastating memories that led him to experiment drugs, damaging him in mind and body.<br /><br />On the plus side, Ray is a interesting and funny fellow.  He has his way of getting attention and getting the respect he deserves.  It's funny how he also has his way with the ladies...let's just say it's all in the wrist (literally).  What a heartthrob.  Improvisation is Ray's special niche, because when he gets into a bad situation or got a problem with someone, he just turns these annoyances into song, and he made a lot of great hits improvising.  Ray taught me a good lesson:  it doesn't matter if you're blind, you're no different from the others; you're either act positive or act negative.  With Ray, this movie show him not as a blind guy with talent, but a guy with talent.<br /><br />For some reason, Jamie Foxx is having his best year.  He kicked A when he's in "Collateral", and here, he's wonderful portraying as the recently-departed Ray Charles.  I'm surprised how a comedian like him can do so well when transitioned into drama.  He capture the stature and functionally of the icon so tightly, and he's very involved within the character's role.  Another funny thing I realized is that after watching the credits, it list some of the Ray Charles songs in which Foxx actually sang, written by the man himself.  Who knew Foxx had the soul of a singer in him?  While I can remember their names, the remaining cast were all great too.  Like every biography of its type, "Ray" includes the original songs, and Ray Charles's songs, such as "What`d I Say" and "Hit the Road Jack", really brought in some validity to this film.<br /><br />THE FINAL WORD: Astonishing.  I first had no interest in "Ray" since it's already been critically-acclaimed and I thought this wouldn't really leave me much of what's already been criticized.  My god, how come I didn't see this sooner?  Other than a few editing mistakes "Ray" was a flaw-less true-story movie: it was funny, it left me in tears, it was full of character and optimism.  This is possibly the best film I've seen in 2004, and I hope this movie deserves an Oscar nomination; it's also one of those rare black drama cinemas that actually make me feel good instead of feeling depressed.  If the inventor of soul was alive right now, he probably would've been amazed by this tribute.<br /><br />You did good, Jack.  You did good.</p></body></html>

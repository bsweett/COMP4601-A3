<meta name="summary" content="Emma Thompson wrecks civilization"></head><body><p>Emma Thompson has got a lot to answer for, what with her first juking the world with her "Erm, I say, I may have the cure for cancer" revelation, except that her vaccine instead transforms most of the world's populace into savage zombie creatures. This makes it a rather monumental oopsie. Anyway, that's it for Emma Thompson, whose early cameo establishes the post-apocalyptic premise. She's never seen again in this film. But she's done enough.<br /><br />I AM LEGEND is the third film adapting Richard Matheson's classic horror story, although, far as I'm concerned, no one yet's come close to doing justice to the novel. In terms of how it stacks up against the previous two adaptations, I prefer I AM LEGEND over THE OMEGA MAN (with Charlton Heston) but not over THE LAST MAN ON EARTH (with a fantastic Vincent Price). Will Smith's performance is top notch. Respecting the bleak tone of the movie, Smith stays away from his trademark touches of humor. Instead, Smith delivers one of his strongest performances, plays up his terrific knack for garnering the movie audiences' sympathy. With expressions of despair and horror perpetually etched on his features, Smith humanizes the hell out of his character.<br /><br />Films like this underscore just how fragile and ephemeral society can be. You topple the infrastructure and break society's contract, and where are we? A palpable sense of desolation, this disquieting thing, shoots thru you as you take in scenes of a deserted New York City. The story picks up there three years after Emma Thompson's cataclysmic bungle. We meet virologist Dr. Robert Neville, the city's (and maybe the world's) last surviving human - as he and his dog Sam tool around the empty, weedy streets in a sports car. In the intervening years - or, as I'm wont to call it, the Post-Emma Thompson Age - Neville has grown strange and a bit mad. Loneliness will do that, and as well that nagging sense that you may be the last left of your kind. Neville, who is immune to the monster-making virus, has never stopped his efforts to unearth a cure, conducting experiments in his basement laboratory. Every day he wakes up and goes about his daily routine. H exercises. He frequents the local video store (in which he'll socialize with mannequins he'd clothed). When the sun reaches its zenith, he waits at the sea port hoping against hope to rendezvous with other survivors. He occasionally hunts for game (wild life, CG-rendered, now dot the cityscape). He's home before dark, barricading his sunlit house with heavy steel shutters. And, after dark, the monsters come out. Maybe the film's most harrowing moment, and the most heartbreaking, is when we glimpse Neville, weapon in hand, and his dog Sam cowering in the bathtub as terrible noises from the outside bombard their ears. The fear is palpable.<br /><br />Dr. Robert Neville has been in a rut, and it takes two game-changing events to flip the scenario. The first event shatters his spirits. The second one heralds the arrival of a woman named Anna (the gorgeous Alice Braga) and a young boy named Ethan, both of whom have listened to Neville's recorded daily radio brodasts and decided to take a chance. At this juncture, Will Smith's acting chops come into play again as his character demonstrates the jarring awkwardness and confusion one goes thru when introduced to company after having been alone for so long. Anna and Ethan serve to regalvanize the plot, toss it down a new direction.<br /><br />The zombies - or Dark Seekers - up the jeopardy by proving to have more game than just skittering around, biting human flesh. One particular zombie exhibits a measure of cunning and, in fact, turns the tables on Neville, and does this in a deliberately ironic way. The one knock against these zombies is that the CG rendering is just a hair off. The film's third act, in fact, is just a hair off as things degenerate into a series of garden variety action sets. Still, for what Will Smith brings to the table and for several impactful scenes which really resonate, I AM LEGEND is worth your time.<br /><br />In the "Ain't Nepotism Grand?" Department, Will Smith's real life daughter, Willow, plays Neville's daughter in all those flashbacks.</p></body></html>

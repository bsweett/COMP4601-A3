In his first major action role as the lethal machine, who is aptly described by Michael Biehn's charcter Reese: "It can't be bargained with! It can't be reasoned with! It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!" Arnie is the quintessential killing machine on a mission to off Sarah Conner (Linda Hamilton) to prevent the birth of John Conner, the leader of the resistance against the future war of man against the machines.<br />The action is thrilling, heart-pounding stuff, with the Termintor on a mission to kill anyone who gets in the way. Stan Winston's animatronics used to create the Terminator are brilliant and the CG is "Whoa" material. Director Cameron, (Let's forgive him for Piranha 2) here shows what he can do when it comes to action, and boy, does he do it well! This is truly one of the most explosive, thrilling and amazing sci fi action films ever made. The DVD extras are excellent too, with commentaries, 'making of's, "terminated" deleted scenes, trailers that fully capture the menace of the machine and the nerve-shredding pace of the film, production info and more. YOU MUST OWN THIS DISC.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="2.5 stars...what a waste"></head><body><p>This is one of the most overhyped movies out there. I admit, this movie started of strong, but after the 1st hour or so...it just spiralled downhill.<br /><br />It is about Alex Hitchens, this date doctor who basically helps big-hearted losers to get noticed by their dream girls. In his words, he creates the opportunity for them. One of these guys happens to be Albert who has a thing for Allegra, the rich and beautiful multi-millionaire. Meanwhile, Alex meets Sara who's a gossip columnist and sparks fly. What happens next? I'm sure anyone with a brain would know.<br /><br />I have nothing against romantic comedies. The thing with this kind of movies is the story. We all know how it's gonna end, so the writers should thrill us with the ride there. A good romantic comedy should evoke some kind of emotions. Unfortunately, even with the talented cast they have here, it's all gone to waste with a lousy and utterly predictable script. The starting 10-15 minutes was great, and I was actually looking forward to the movie. Then Will Smith gave me laughs when trying to woo Sara, played by sexy Eva Mendes. But other than this, there's nothing else that entertained me. And most of the funny scenes are actually in the movie trailer.<br /><br />Kevin James, who I really like in King Of Queens is underused here. And his chemistry with Allegra (played by Amber Valleta) seems kinda dead. He doesn't really seem that infatuated with her. Will Smith tries to salvage this movie for all he can, but there's just so much a guy can do. The second half of the movie really was pretty boring because of it's predictability and it seemed like I was watching a mixture of other romantic comedies (How to Lose A Guy in 10 Days and Notting Hill comes to mind).<br /><br />This movie might be good to watch with your partner, but even then...just rent it, it's not worth buying. This movie fails because of the script, the actors bring all they can to their roles but it just isn't enough. If you want good romantic comedies, get Hugh Grant's movies...they're predictable of course but you'll have a hell of a good time watching the story unfold.</p></body></html>

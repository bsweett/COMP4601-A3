<meta name="summary" content="Nice looking but boring"></head><body><p>This is a film that certainly should stand as an example of &quot;style over substance.&quot;  All the actors (except Scott Speedman)run around obviously feeling very cool and stylish in their dark costumes, but they forget to invest any real feeling into their performances.<p>But that isn't entirely their fault.  The idea of a whole separate &quot;underworld&quot; co-existing with ours, wherein vampires and lycans battle each other is pretty neat, but it's hard to imagine a movie doing LESS with the concept.  And Kate Beckinsale (a vampire and lycan-hunter extraordinare) and Scott Speedman (bitten by a lycan) are sort-of Romeo and Juliet types, except the actors and the script forgets to inject any actual heat (or hint of believability) into their &quot;romance.&quot;  We gather that for some reason Beckinsale cares for the milquetoast, slightly seedy looking Speedman, but can't begin to imagine WHY!<p>Beckinsale looks good in her costume.  She's got a lean body and the right features for the role. But she's really pretty light-weight...and I'm concered that she's becoming a movie action figure, what with a lead role in VAN HELSING (where the previews make it clear she's got a terrible accent!).  I've liked her in many things (LAUREL CANYON, for example) but this project lets her down...and she let's it down too.  Although it's unlikely she could carry it.<p>The film gets two stars (rather than one) for the costumes and for the great special effects when an ancient vampire (played by Bill Nighy) is brought prematurely back to life.  He puts on layers of himself and we get to see the gory transformation.  Someone put a lot of work into that...too bad the others involved in the film didn't try so hard.<p>Can't really recommend this one to anyone, but I don't think there are any materials that a kid over 13 can't see.</p></body></html>

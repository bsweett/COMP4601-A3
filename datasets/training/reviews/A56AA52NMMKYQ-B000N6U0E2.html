<meta name="summary" content="Feel-good tale: There is no substitute for hard work!"></head><body><p>Based on a true story, "The Pursuit of Happyness" features Will Smith as Chris Gardner, a struggling San Francisco medical equipment salesman beset with financial problems.  Tired of the struggle, his wife moves out and leaves him with their little boy.  As they spiral down the financial shaft, they are reduced to sleeping in homeless shelters and in subway bathrooms.<br /><br />Gardner lands an unpaid internship to become a Dean Witter stockbroker.  Juggling the demands of fatherhood, keeping financial wolves at bay, selling his remaining inventory of bone density scanners and cracking the books to become a broker, Smith's character pursues his vision like one who has run out of alternatives.<br /><br />Yes, it's a bit hokey and at times requires you to swallow the implausible, but this is an uplifting film that can inspire you to overcome obstacles and achieve your goals.</p></body></html>

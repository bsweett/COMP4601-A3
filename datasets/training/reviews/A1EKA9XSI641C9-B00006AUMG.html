<meta name="summary" content="OBVIOUS COMIC BOOK BASED"></head><body><p>This reminds me of Batman Forever and Batman and Robin so much.  It's so obviuosly based on a comic book, unlike the first film, which is genualy entertaining.  This movie is Matrix Reloaded vs. Bad Vampire Movie.  If you liked the first movie, you should see this because the 3rd Blade film is coming out soon, and you should probably bridge the gap between this and that.  The ending seems important, but the rest is mind numbing.  It's overly long also.  It drags on from about the middle to the end, despite the various gun firing and fist fighting.</p></body></html>

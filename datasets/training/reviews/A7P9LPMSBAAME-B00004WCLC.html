<meta name="summary" content="HMMMM. WELL, PT SURE TOOK THE SCENIC ROUTE ON THIS ONE. WHAT'S UP WITH THE FROGS?"></head><body><p>I loved reading the reviews on this one. Some really loved it, others really hated it. Some in between, too. I would not call it great, but I really did like it. It's hard to believe it was over 3 hours long. I thought EVERY actor was VERY GOOD, VERY GOOD. And I was never bored. I do think it was kinda' strange. I would only recommend this one selectively. The word PRETENTIOUS came up often in the negative reviews. I do not agree with that. Different yes, pretentious no. Not for everyone on a number of levels. Die Hard it's not.<br />It is difficult for me to understand how anyone could find Tom Cruise' performance anything other than stellar. I really liked John C Reilly in this, and I normally don't. Macy was fabulous and so was Moore. Robards was really good and so was Hoffman. A really great cast, and EVERYONE was at the top of their acting game. BRAVO.</p></body></html>

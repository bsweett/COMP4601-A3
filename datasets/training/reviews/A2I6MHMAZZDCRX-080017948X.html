<meta name="summary" content=""Do You Ever Have Deja Vu?"  "Did You Just Ask Me That?""></head><body><p>Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is a self-absorbed weatherman in Pittsburg who is obsessed with moving to a larger market.  As part of his job, he goes every year to Pitsatony to cover the groundhog festivities on February 2nd.  This year, he is going with his producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) and camera guy Larry (Chris Elliot).  He can't wait to get home, but a blinding snowstorm makes it impossible for them to leave.<br /><br />The next morning, Phil wakes up to discover that it isn't the next morning.  And no matter what he does, every morning he wakes up to find it is February 2nd.  Slowly, he begins to learn from his mistakes and do thing differently.  But will he ever get out of this repetitive repetition?<br /><br />After hearing this movie praised for years, I finally got a chance to see it.  And I enjoyed it.  There are lots of very funny moments as Phil deals with his predicament.  His reactions near the beginning are priceless.  And there is a very heartwarming message underneath it all.<br /><br />However, I did find it got old before the movie was over.  And there are some very dark scenes that felt out of place for the comedy it was supposed to be.<br /><br />Those are minor issues, however.  So if you've missed this movie, get it today and enjoy it over and over and over and over again.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bland sequel to a bland movie"></head><body><p>Not only was "Get Shorty" monumentally overrated, its sequel, "Be Cool", is anything but cool. This movie, which is full of stars and familiar faces -- some in unfamiliar roles -- should have been a lot better than this for its star power alone.<br /><br />Yet this remake of "Get Shorty", where the lead character is now in the music business, doesn't seem to have any point. Be cool? Isn't that what all movies with big name stars are about?<br /><br />This one seems to be a parody of Hollywood and its fame machine, but is limpid in its portrait of that parody. It is also said to be a comedy but I cannot recall once laughing during this film.<br /><br />This movie has one thing going for it: it is magnificently shot in wonderful lighting. Every scene makes the actors appear breathlessly beautiful. You can see every hair in its place (none are out of place) and every wrinkle is gone. These people look better than movie people have ever looked.<br /><br />But,even in Hollywood, looks alone are not enough. It takes something more, some unknown power to make a movie a hit. This one doesn't have it. If looking at a lot of big stars and beautiful people in good lighting is enough for you, this is your ticket. Otherwise, move on.</p></body></html>

The quality of this series has been slowly sliding, and even though this movie is OK, I am at a point at which I would not recommend it. There are still some sparks of clever humor and an efficient use of satire at certain times, but there are portions of the film that come close to putting the audience to sleep. Overall, I would have to say that this production shows an uneven quality throughout its duration, and that it is reaching that point commonly known for series as jump-the-shark.<br /><br />This time around, the story deals with filling the position of king of Far Far Away. The Frog King, while in his deathbed, asks Shrek to do this, together with Fiona, but the ogre could not be less interested. Thus, he goes on a quest to find Arthur, Fiona's cousin, to take the hot seat. Meanwhile, Prince Charming is plotting, together with every villain that ever existed in a fairy tale, to overthrow the current government and take possession of the throne. Ohh! I almost forgot; there is the small issue of the pregnancy!<br /><br />As mentioned before, there are some segments in which the satiric elements make us laugh and keep us entertained, especially when Shrek visits Arthur's high school. The music is also pretty good, as has been characteristic of the series, but it is definitely not at the level of the first movie. However, these features are not enough to make this film one to be recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Terminator  (1984)"></head><body><p>Director:  James Cameron.<br /><br />Cast:  Arnold Schwarzenegger, Linda Hamilton, Michael Biehn.<br /><br />Rated R for violence, language, nudity, and sexual situations.<br /><br />Running Time:  108 minutes.<br /><br />Underrated and much more entertaining than many would lead you to believe, "The Terminator" is one of the most innovative science-fiction thrillers of all-time and is also the film that put Arnold Schwarzenegger on the Hollywood map.  The Governor of California stars as an android robot sent from the future to destroy an unsuspecting future mother (Linda Hamilton) of a child that will disrupt mankind's fight against technology in decades to come.  Michael Biehn (with a superb supporting performance) plays a time-traveling agent also sent back from the future, but his role is to make sure that Hamilton is contained safely until the terminating android is destroyed.<br /><br />One of the earlier works from the great James Cameron ("Titanic", "Aliens"), this special effects spectacle is an entertaining roller-coaster ride full of thrills, macabre, and good ol' Schwarzenegger fun.  The film may unfortunately be known for some of the terminator's corny lines ("I'll be back."), but it should be recognized for one of the best cinematic climaxes in science-fiction history.  Excellent cinematography, a solid musical score, and nice performances.  Outdone by its sequel, but special and important in its own right.</p></body></html>

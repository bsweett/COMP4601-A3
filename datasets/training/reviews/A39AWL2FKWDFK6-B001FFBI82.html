<meta name="summary" content="Microcosmic view of Desert Shield"></head><body><p>Using the deserts of the Southwest and California and under the direction of Sam Mendes, we get an unabashed depiction of U.S. Marine involvement in Iraq.  Through the eyes of marine ("jarhead") Anthony Swofford played by Jake Gyllenhaal, we get the full view of his experiences commencing in the harsh brutal environment of basic training.<br /><br />Gyllenhaal trains as a scout sniper under the tough love of his platoon leader SSgt. Sykes played nicely by Jamie Foxx.  They eventually ship out to the deserts of Saudi Arabia soon after the seizure of Kuwait by Iraq.  Each man must deal with the stress and anxiety of possible chemical and biologic warfare and months of boring inactivity in the sweltering desert heat.  As time rolls on Gyllenhaal, whose family life is a disaster becomes obsessed about the fidelity of his girlfriend from back home.  This puts more focus on murkiness behind the objectives of the Marine presence there.<br /><br />Director Mendes does a meritorious job of creating the hellhole of a setting that Desert Shield was including oil spewing burning wells and incinerated corpses decaying under the desert sun.  He aptly points out that this experience can't help but shape the future of all those who served in that conflict.</p></body></html>

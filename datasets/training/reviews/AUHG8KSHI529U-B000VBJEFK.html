A family movie that is fun, has a story that is engaging for children and adults, and is quite fresh.  I mean a story about a rat who cooks?  Rats around human food are most everyone's nightmare, but Remy (Patton Oswalt) is a rat whose food you would want to taste.  He is a rat you would like to get to know.  Remy is a rat we want to see in at least one sequel!<br /><br />Remy's father, Django (Brian Dennehy), is the leader of their huge rat clan.  They scavenge where they can and stay out of sight of humans as much as they can.  Emile (Peter Sohn) is Remy's not too bright brother who is happy to eat anything almost constantly.  Remy has become a fan of a once great French Chef named Gusteau (Brad Garrett) who died of a broken heart shortly after his masterpiece "Anyone Can Cook" was published and panned by the feared food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole).<br /><br />By the time fate gets Remy to Gusteau's restaurant, it is an institution for the tourists, although the cooks there care in their own way.  Chef Skinner managed to take the place over and is gearing up to market Gusteau's image on a variety of frozen foods.<br /><br />This is as far as I want to take you in setting up the story.  Well, one more thing.  A young man named Linguini shows up looking for any job.  His mother has died and she was a friend of Gusteau's, so he gets a job cleaning up.  Remy and Linguini form as close a friendship as a rat and a young man can have, given the language barriers and all.  However, it does help that Remy can understand humans and can even read.<br /><br />This is a movie I have watched several times already and is still very enjoyable.  Superbly done in every way.  The animation is wonderful and the voice characterizations are great (there are many more fine performances than I could list).  Enjoy it!<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI</p></body></html>

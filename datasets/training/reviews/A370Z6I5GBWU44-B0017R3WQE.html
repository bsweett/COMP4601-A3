<meta name="summary" content="Good movie"></head><body><p>I was born after this movie was made, so watching it is almost like a time-warp when I look at the outfits and the technology they had back then. I am certain that Scarface would have gone along differently if this had all happened thirty years later, with the technology we have now.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this is a classic movie, though it is not for everyone due to the drugs and violence in it. The reason why I give this movie four instead of five stars is because some things were left unanswered, like what happened to Elvira, but the very last scene with the shootout was pretty fricking epic.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="5 stars for the movie and 4 stars for the dvd"></head><body><p>Walt Disney's Sleeping Beauty got a G rating, but this movie does not deserve a G rating. This deserves a PG rating. This movie may frighten young children than to charm them. And this movie is coming out of the vault on video and dvd in America on September 9. This animated movie does not have a lot of familar voices (or at least to me) but a lot of them has gone on to perfrom more voices in Diseny's later movies like The Sword in the Stone, and the Jungle Book. As the movie opens, a baby is born to King Stefan (Taylor Holmoes) and his queen. They name the baby Aurora (Mary Costa). And then at a celbration, three good faries show up with the gifts. Flora (Verna Felton) gives Aurora the gift of beauty, Fauna (Barbara Jo Allen) gives Aurora the gift of song, but before Merryweather (Barbara Luddy) can give her gift, an evil fairy named Maleficent (Eleanor Aldey) shows up uninvited, and to prove she is not upset by not getting invited, she does give Aurora a gift, which is before the sun set on her 16th birthday, Princess Aurora will prick her finger on ths spindle of a spinning wheel and will die. Merryweather changes the speel form death to sleep if this does happen. Princess Aurora was promsied to King Huevert's (Bill Thompson) son Prince Phillip (Bill Shirley). And King Stefan who is afraid for his daughter's life, has all the spinning wheels in the kingdom burned. And then the 3 good faires comes with a plan to become 3 peasents and raise Princess Aurora and protect her from Maleficent, and they change her name to Brair Rose. And for 16 years, Maleficent is so frusted about worrying about where Princess Aurora is hiding for 16 years, and she sends out her pet, to search for her. While the 3 good fairs, are planning a party for Briar Rose.</p></body></html>

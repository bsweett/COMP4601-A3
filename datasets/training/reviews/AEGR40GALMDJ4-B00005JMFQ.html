<meta name="summary" content="An "It's A Wonderful Life" for the 2000s"></head><body><p>There were many epics released in 2003, Cold Mountain, Return of the King, and Big Fish, but none was more unexpected than the Romantic Comedy "Epic" Love Actually.  Set in charming merry old England at Christmas time, Love Actually, brought forth holiday chher like no other film in the holiday season.  You leave the theater, wanting to fall in love with someone.  The film brought together great British acting, which included Emma Thompson, Liam Neeson, Colin Firth, and OMG Keira Knightly. It all came together in a not so tiring 2 1/2 hours.  See it for a feel good time.</p></body></html>

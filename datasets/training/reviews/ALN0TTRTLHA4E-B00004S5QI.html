<meta name="summary" content="The music was nice but the story was dumb"></head><body><p>This is not really a film about Mozart at all. Peter Shaffer the English playwright read some of Mozart's letters which suggested that his sense of humour was rather focused on fart jokes and chamber pots. He wrote a play which was basically about the composer Antonio Saleiri who was older but a contempory of Mozart. Saleiri was a person who was succesfull in material terms and was also a person who had considerable skills and became a court favourite in Vienna. As a musician however he was not that talented and although his music was alright it has not ever been seen as the work of a genious and is played only occasionally as a curiosity. <p>Schaffers play was about Saleiri and his jealously over Mozarts talent. Through the play he is tormented by the fact that whilst Mozart writes music as beautiful as that heard in heaven Saleri's music is at best pedesterian. Further that this is all so undserved as Mozart was so crass. It of course is a further irony that although Saleri hated Mozart he was one of the few who could appreciate the genius of his work. Otherwise Mozart was not that popular and many thought his music overly complex. <p>Now what has happened is that this play has been sort of adapted for film. Instead of Mozart cracking fart jokes at every spare opportunity he is made to appear vulgar. His music in played through the film in short bits and his father is made to appear a tyranical character. <p>The reality of Mozart's life is of course different than this. He very much reflected the time with his sense of humour and the way he expressed himself. The notion of him being a vulgarian is simply a creation of Schaffer's play. The film thus presents a rather unrealistic portrait of his life and it also paints others of the period in the same way. The Emperor Joseph is played as a clown despite the fact that he could sight read music play the piano well and was a person of considerable interlect. <p>If one knows a bit about Mozart the film is thus a bit irritating. It is also unfortunate that a perception has grown up that this is an authentic biography. Still its not the worst film of all time.</p></body></html>

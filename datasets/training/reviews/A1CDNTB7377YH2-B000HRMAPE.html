<meta name="summary" content="The Best of the Post TV Show Projects!"></head><body><p>This movie easily outshines the short lived TV sequel and the first two cinematic projects.  The action is nothing short of spectacular and the effects are as good as any of the top action films that have come out in the last few years.<br /><br />Some of the plot reminded me of True Lies (Cruz can't tell his wife what he really does for a living and she only know that he has to go out of town frequently) and really starts to hone in on Cruz's psyche.<br /><br />The kidnapping of the bad guy in the seemingly super secure Vatican was amazing and I am surprised that the Vatican let it be shot since it could give would be real bad guys ideas.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Arguably Hitchcock's Best!"></head><body><p>I like Hitchcock's "claustrophobic" thrillers like this...LIFEBOAT and ROPE.  Everything comes together perfectly in this classic film--and the bonus features do an admirable job of paying tribute to those contributions.  Jimmy Stewart is at his "everyman" best...Grace Kelly at her most gorgeous...Thelma Ritter at her wittiest (there is a special place in Heaven for her and Eve Arden---it must be SRO!).<br /><br />No film fan can be excused for not having this one in their collection!</p></body></html>

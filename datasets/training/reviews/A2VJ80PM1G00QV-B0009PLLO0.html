<meta name="summary" content="Interesting Film"></head><body><p>It is too many years since I last read a detailed biography of Alexander for knowledge of the reality (as best we can know it) to have anything to do with my enjoyment of the film. In most cases, it takes pretty much the standard epic biography line, with the addition of the bi-sexuality that C.B. DeMille would never have been permitted to show, much as he would have liked to do so, if it were possible under Hayes Office rules. The Oedipal situation is also given more overt presence than would have passed the censors in the heyday of Biblical (and other historical) epics. On the positive side, the battle scenes were well done cinematically, with the use of elephants being particularly striking. (I believe the disciplined formations of elephants shown in the film is historically inaccurate, the elephant proving to have too unruly in combat to be an effective weapon). I have no complaint about historical inaccuracies when it comes to entertainment vehicles.<br />While the director makes a good faith effort to account for the driving ambition in a man seeking to conquer the known universe (as  portrayed in the film) I could not help but feel that the motivations of so complex a many are nearly impossible to capture in a period more than a millennium past. However, the director does a good job of delineating a motivational base adequate to the needs of the film.<br />Most of the actors filled their roles adequately, historical drama being a notorious burial ground for even the best of actors. The lead showed too little charisma, no personal fault involved,  this being a mostccomplicated man he had to play. Mostly, when an actor failed, it appeared to have been a consequence of the script.<br />So, over-all I did not find this to be a particularly exciting film, but it was interesting. Hopefully, both I and other readers, will be stimulated to learn more about this towering historical figure.</p></body></html>

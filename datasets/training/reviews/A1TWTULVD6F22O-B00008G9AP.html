The film version of the second J.K. Rowling novel has been on everyone's "want to see" list, and director Chris Columbus does not disappoint.<br />Once again, the screenplay adaptation is true to the book, and little of significance has been left out.  Although it may escape the youngest viewers, Harry's discomfort with the fact that he is a celebrity begins to show, and the class war between Wizards and those  with partial "Muggle" blood is featured, foreshadowing class conflicts we have in the real world.<p>The film opens with the soaring "Harry Potter" music, and you first begin to realize how much you equate it with the films, kind of like the "Star Wars" theme. Harry's life at his "Muggle" home is featured, but it isn't long before visitors (our first glimpse of Dobby, the House Elf, magically created in computer graphics) and an action-packed appearance by the Weasley brothers, in a marvelous car, shake up Harry's world, and it's back to magic!  The Weasley home, shown briefly, is a charming wonder.  It's funny to see how the young actors have changed, with Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) now much taller than Harry...they were the same height in the first film.  <p>This segment at Hogwarts is far darker and scarier than in the first movie.  There is a threatening tone for Harry throughout, and the Hogwarts staff is frightened and mystified by attacks on staff and students.  The bond between Harry, Ron and Hermione is very strong, and all the young actors are convincing in their roles. One of the great scenes occurs with the polyjuice potion, with Hermione very matter-of-fact about the ghost that haunts the girl's bathroom and amusing transformations for the three of them.  <p> One of my favorites, Kenneth Branagh, steals scenes as the egotistical professor of the dark arts, Gilderoy Lockhart.  Lockhart is comically inept at his magic, and very vain of his appearance - Branagh adds just the right touch.  Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) is back, and his best scenes are when he is drolly putting down Lockhart.  This will be Richard Harris' last turn as Dumbledore, and he is featured heavily, along with the incredible Fawkes, his computer generated pet Phoenix. Robbie Coltrane returns as Hagrid, and we learn more about him than in the first film.  The ladies, too, are back, and a new favorite is Professor Sprout; you'll laugh at her gardening class!  One role that was wonderfully cast was Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy, Draco's father.  He drips evil all over the film as his character sets out to destroy Dumbledore and all Wizards with Muggle blood. <p>Quidditch is even better than before, with many of the scenes exhilarating and scary. The monsters that Harry encounters on his way to the Chamber are mesmerizing, and beautifully filmed.  Harry is less of a spectator in this film, and uses his own skills and magic to overcome the obstacles cast in his way.  <p>One of the most charming elements of the film are the little jokes that escape you during the first viewing, that you hear when you finally get the DVD.  Here's my favorite:  after Ron bumbles a spell containing slugs, the friends take him to Hagrid to help him get through  throwing up slugs.  Hagrid sits him down and says he'll need "special equipment" to help him get through it....then hands him a wooden bucket!  Priceless little jokes like this permeate the film, and for that reason, many choose to see it several times in the theater.<p>Why the "A-" rating?  The film, at nearly 3 hours long, needed more editing. Perhaps a little less of Dobbie...? And, unfortunately, although I loved the special effects, the violence in several scenes makes this a movie to which I would not choose to take a preschool child.  That said, neither of these drawbacks really affected the way I personally viewed the movie, and, I still am just wild about Harry ! <p>Go, see and enjoy!</p></body></html>

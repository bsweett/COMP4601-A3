<meta name="summary" content="Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"></head><body><p>Before year five at Hogwarts can even begin, Harry (Radclife) and his cousin Dudley are attacked by dementors in the muggle world.  Soon Harry finds himself on trial for having used magical powers to save himself and his cousin.  Voldemort's (Fiennes) presence is felt everywhere.  The Ministry of Magic denies he is alive.  Those at Hogwarts, specifically the Order of the Phoenix, know better.  To stop the truth from getting out, the Ministry sends Dolores Umbridge (Staunton) to Hogwarts.  She gradually begins to seize power, punishing those students and teacher who dare to challenge her.  Meanwhile, Harry is having visions and teaching his classmates himself to prepare them for an inevitable showdown.<br /><br />Gone are the lighter days of "Harry Potter" 1 & 2.  "Order of the Phoenix" is firmly traveling down the dark road that will end two movies in the future.  The movies have grown up, and that is very welcome.  Each is better than the one before, and "Order of the Phoenix" is no exception.  The actors could play their characters in their sleep at this point, and returning to the wizard world is like visiting old friends.  Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson have all become the beloved characters at this point, and the supporting cast has accomplished the same with less screen time.  David Yates brings yet another voice to the director's chair, and pulls it off despite limited motion picture experience.  "Order of the Phoenix" is another fine film in what is probably one of the most significant movie franchises ever.  I highly recommend this film.</p></body></html>

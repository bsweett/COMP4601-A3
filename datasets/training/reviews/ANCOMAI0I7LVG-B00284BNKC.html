Everything from its intense subject matter to its sporadic and chaotic direction is set to either draw you in or push you away.  I don't think there can be an in between for this film.  You either love it wholeheartedly or you loathe it and consider it a waste of time.  It's a film that will leave you feeling dirty, feeling depressed and maybe even feeling bad about yourself but I feel that in the right context these are all good feelings for us to have because they force us to consider things we may never make the time to consider.<br /><br />Drug addiction is painted in most films as devastating but beatable, something that can ruin lives but can be overcome.  In so many movies today we watch our main character suffer at the hands of his addiction only to watch him rise above and overcome the adversary, turning over a new leaf and moving forward on a new path.  If that is what you are expecting to see then be forewarned, there are no happy endings to be found in `Requiem...'.  In fact, `Requiem for a Dream' paints this picture so harshly, so unsympathetically one is forced to realize that not all addictions are beatable.  Sometimes, well, most of the time there is no coming back.  The reason I feel that `Requiem for a Dream' is such an important film is because it shows the audience the ugly truth behind a very common and widespread problem.  You won't walk away from this movie and think lightly of the occasional drug run.  You won't think that there's nothing wrong with a high here or there.  You will be repulsed by the very idea of a manufactured euphoria and will cringe at the thought of ending up like any of the characters portrayed in this film.<br /><br />This film is designed to prevent drug abuse.<br /><br />The film follows the lives of four individuals all connected to one another.  You have Sara Goldfarb, an elderly lady who lives really for nothing except the off chance that she could be on television.  She watches her game shows and thinks of nothing else.  Her son Harry is so dependant of drugs that he's willing to steal his mother's belongings to get the money for a high.  His best friend Tyrone is just as guilty and his girlfriend Marion is along for the ride.  The film follows each of their addictions (Sara becomes addicted to diet pills in an attempt to lose enough weight to fit in a dress she's determined to wear on television) and fleshes out the pain, degradation and hopelessness each addiction leaves it's host in.<br /><br />What helps propel this film along is the stellar performances by the entire cast, most notably its two leading ladies.  Ellen Burstyn rightfully was awarded a Best Actress nomination at the Oscars for her brilliant portrayal of Sara.  She really gets inside this woman and makes her delusions so real to the audience.  She takes something that could have, in the wrong hands, gone camp or been comical and makes it so raw and emotionally stimulating.  Her pain is essentially our pain and this makes the film so much more real to us.  Jennifer Connelly is flawlessly stunning as Marion Silver.  Her character has such a subtle yet moving arch towards the closing of the film when we watch her desperation grow to the point of no return.  It's heartbreaking but also extremely realistic.  Jared Leto is also remarkable here.  He has a lot of misses as an actor but when he hits it he hits it out of the park.  His portrayal of Harry is emotional and resilient.  Marlon Wayans blew me away.  I didn't know he had this in him, but he succeeds with flying colors at making his character real and moving.  I still can't get over this performance, so utterly unexpected.<br /><br />A lot has been said for Aronofsky's visionary style.  I'm going to say a little bit now.  His direction of this film is a perfect compliment to the subject and depiction he was going for.  The chaotic editing helps keep the audience in the right frame of mind, further embellishing the mental state of our protagonists.  As we watch the screen shift back and forth violently with each depiction of drug intake we get the sense that this is really destroying the characters from the inside out.  Aronofsky expressed brilliant judgment in his decisions while making this film.<br /><br />So, like I mentioned earlier, this is not a film for everyone.  It is brutal in many ways and very hard to watch both emotionally and visually if you are not prepared for it.  If you can sit through this masterpiece though I highly recommend it because it's a film unlike any other and one that we all should take notice of.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Enough Science Fiction already!!!!"></head><body><p>This film was totally unbelievable on more than a few counts. The man didn't actually DO anything to this "little girl", and the "torture" she puts him through is akin to a felony!<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong, I am a Mother of four, a Grandmother of two, and a Great-Grandmother of another four, and I believe very strongly in the protection of children against Child Molesters, but c'mon, this poor guy just did not deserve what he got. To be pushed to what amounts to suicide? What about the "little girl"? How on Earth did she become such a master manipulator? What was her home life like? She learned this stuff somewhere.<br /><br />All of us moviegoers are essentially "Voyeurs", and what I witnessed was a crime! This was NOT a case of child molestation. This was a case of Torture, resulting in death (read:MURDER, in the first degree)! I realize that there was a message to this film, and I'm in NO WAY defending child molesters, but this film sends the wrong message. If the makers of this film wanted another "Death Wish", why wasn't it labeled as such? The man was only guilty in the little girls' mind (whether or not he was, is never proved).<br /><br />American Society has become paranoid. The result of this paranoia is a hypersensitivity to situations that haven't happened yet (I call it the "what-if" syndrome). This film is a prime example of the syndrome. The man may have been guilty in thought, but not deed. Do we now become the "Thought Police"?!<br /><br />The DVD had the usual extra features, and the playback is very good.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Great Flick"></head><body><p>This is a great story with a lot of themes.  It contains racism, bitterness, accountability, kindness, heroism, and redemption.  And that is just in the main character, Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood).<br /><br />Walt is a cantankerous Korean War vet who is a recent widower.  His next door neighbors are a Hmong extended family.  A teenage boy in the clan, Thao (Bee Vang) is being pressured heavily to join a street gang to which his cousin belongs.  He is resistant, but eventually succumbs.  As an initiation rite he is required to steal Kowalski's prize possession, a 1972 Ford Gran Torino.<br /><br />In typical Eastwood fashion, he is a heroic tough guy even at 78 years old.  He stops Thao from stealing the car.  Eventually he takes the lad under his wing.  The story of inter-generational friendship between them is strong and very well done.<br /><br />This is really a great show.  The language and racial slurs are a bit rough so it is not a good one for younger viewers, but it is a very good one for the adults.</p></body></html>

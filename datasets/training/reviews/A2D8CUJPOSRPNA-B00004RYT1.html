It was with this film that the horror genre, thought to consist of inhuman monsters and dark, stormy castles, entered the modern age and forced filmmakers to look at humanity's darker side with a contemporary look.<p>By now, of course, everyone knows the story: A woman (Janet Leigh) ends up stealing $40,000 from her boss, drives from Phoenix to Central California to meet with her lover (John Gavin) but never makes it thanks to the "interference" of a motel clerk (Antohny Perkins) and his "mother." Even to this day, however, one can ingeniously look at Hitchcock's film and admire not only the shocks, including the still-potent shower murder, but also the director's deliciously morbid style of black comedy. Perkins made his character Norman Bates into a household work for Madness, and Bernard Herrmann provided us with his celebrated shrieking score, done entirely with strings.<p>The film also marked a point at which the horror film would really tackle subjects that were taboo before--psychology, madness, murder (more explicitly than before) and even necrophilia. This is because the film, scripted by Joseph Stefano from Robert Bloch's novel of the same name, has its roots in the case of the ghoulish Wisconsin mass murderer Ed Geinn, which would also provide inspiration for the 1974 cult classic THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. These elements have helped make PSYCHO a legendary film in ways that the vast number of its imitators could never be. It's intelligent, scary, and unsettling even after endless imitations and such. Even the seemingly unnecessary intrusion of the psychiatrist (Simon Oakland) at the end is far less bothersome than it seems. He gives us a good idea of what sort of a person Norman is: "He was never all Norman. But he was often ONLY MOTHER."<p>For horror and thriller fans, PSYCHO is an absolutely essential addition to your collection if you don't already have it. Pick up this one-of-a-kind masterpiece now!</p></body></html>

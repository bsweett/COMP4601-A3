This movie had so much potential, but it fell flat from the word go.  The story dragged on for what seemed like a lifetime, and Ang Lee's comic-style editing became annoying after the first few minutes.  The highpoint of the movie is, of course, the Hulk.  If you are blessed with a DVD player, simply skip over the parts that don't include a CGI graphic, and you'll have a good time.  Eric Bana didn't win me over as Bruce Banner, and as much as I enjoy Jennifer Connelly, her Betsy character has the emotion of a stone.  Nick Nolte was also a let-down in this feature.  Sam Elliot was okay, but if you took off his military wear and slapped a cowboy hat on him, you'd think you were watching one of his westerns, which he is so much better in than this creation.<p>The &quot;Hulk&quot; creature was fairly good.  Throughout most of the film, he seems reasonably real-life.  If Ang would've given the CGI monster more screen time, this movie would have been a lot better.  Granted, all he does is smash up things and save a few innocents along the way, but that is so much more interesting than the rest of this story.<p>I'm a big fan of comic book movies, and this is one of my least favorite adaptations.  If Ang Lee would have left out a little more of the &quot;why&quot; Banner ended up as a green crushing machine, and got to the substance of this story, perhaps it would have been a lot better.  Besides, when I think of the Hulk, I think about things getting ripped up and trashed.  This movie, however, spends more time on the woes of child abuse, domestic violence, and genetic testing than our green hero.<p>If you can stay awake through the agonizing dialogue and ever-so-slow pace and actually see CGI Hulk, you may like this movie.  If you're a die-hard Hulk fan, you may like this movie.  But if you don't meet this criteria, please just consider this a rental.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="My Favorite Western"></head><body><p>There are so many great things about this movie. It may not be the most historically accurate, but it never strays from being ridiculous, and it always keeps its sharp wit and great action.<p>Along with &quot;Reservoir Dogs,&quot; &quot;Tombstone&quot; is a film with some of the greatest lines I've ever heard. Here's a sample:<p>&quot;I'm you're Huckleberry.&quot;<br />&quot;Drunk piano player...you can't hit nothing. In fact...you're probably seeing double.&quot; / &quot;I have two guns, one for each of you!&quot;<br />&quot;I don't have the words.&quot; / &quot;I know.&quot;<br />&quot;Maybe poker just isn't you game...I know! Lets have a spelling contest!&quot;<p>Don't be surprised if you find yourself using these lines in casual conversation (my friends and I often use the Huckleberry line ourselves).<p>But the character, the flow of the story, and the pure charisma of the characters is all there. Every one turns in a good performance, and the good script only enhances that. I could go on about how many great feelings I have for this movie, but I'll prevent myself. This is truly a modern day classic, western or otherwise.</p></body></html>

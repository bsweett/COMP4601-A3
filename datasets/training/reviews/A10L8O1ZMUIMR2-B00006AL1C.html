<meta name="summary" content="Unique Spin On Time Travel"></head><body><p>The &quot;Back To The Future&quot; movies are well known by most people and are considered to be a classic. It plays not so much on going back in time to save the world, but yourself. It plays on all the things we wonder about time-travel but are never seen in any movies but these. Now to start off with, my liking for them goes in order; the first is my favorite, second is my second favorite, and third is my least favorite. The first film has a unique magic to it, and is capable of surviving the playback test. I could watch it a hundred times and not get sick of it. It's charm keeps bringing you back for more. However, I feel that the other two, mostly the third one, just drag on. The second one is helpful to answer your questions from the first, but the third is almost nonsense. But keeping the somewhat low price in mind, it's so worth it to buy this box set even if you like only the first.<p>The whole set is very nice and polished, picture and sound quality are great and make it seem like you're watching a brand new movie. There are a fair amount of extras on each disk and all are very fun to look through. I guarantee that once you buy this great box set, you will have hours of fun experiencing Marty's adventures through time!</p></body></html>

This, THE DEVIL'S BACKBONE, and THE OTHERS are some of my favorite horror films. They have the knack for tapping into my deepest paranoias and fears, and I love them for that. I've always enjoyed a good ghost story - "good" being the operative word. You don't find many good ghost stories lately. There is most definitely a drought, and so finding a film like THE ORPHANAGE is like finding a needle in a haystack - forgive the cliche. It is terrifying, it is beautiful, and it is heartbreaking. The performances, the direction, the writing, the score, and the SOUND MIX are all top notch and totally effective. I do not wish to go into the story or plot for fear that I may give something away, all that I know is that you should stop what you are doing and rent this, if you are in the mood for a chill. You will not be let down, trust me. You may even get emotional by the end of this film. It's rare to find a film that can scare the piss out of you and make you cry at the same time.<br /><br />RENT IT, BUY IT, whatever, just as long as you SEE IT!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="'Grow On You' type movie, but commentary is GREAT!"></head><body><p>When I first saw this movie in the theater, I wasn't too thrilled with it.  Granted, Kinear's performance is the best of his career thus far, and Nicholson is always a delight, and his Melvin manages to be repulsive and endearing at the same time.  Helen Hunt's performance was inexplicably Oscar-worthy, and I wasn't as impressed with her as the other two leads.  Her accent fluctuates on several occasions, which I found distracting.<p>I received the DVD as a gift, and thankfully, the commentary made me appreciate the movie more.  Commentary is provided by Brooks, Nicholson, Hunt and Kinnear.  It really helped me to view the film in different lights, and now I appreciate the movies more subtle tones.<p>This is definitely a worthwhile addition to your DVD collection.</p></body></html>

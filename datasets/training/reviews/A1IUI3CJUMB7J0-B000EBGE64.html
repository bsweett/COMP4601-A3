<meta name="summary" content="Just great from start to finish"></head><body><p>Not as good as the first one but it's still great and is the best film of the year. The story it self is a little slow at points but the movie stays close to the book. The acting is great and the story is great it's more suspensfull, scary and mature then the first. The movie will have you on the edge of your seat espesially when harry is int he Chamber of secrets. The movie is so great words can hardly describe it.</p></body></html>

Think back to the first time you saw or read about Cinderella or Little Red Riding Hood. There's something special in those stories, something magical and adventurous in every fairy tale. The Brothers Grimm is one giant fairy tale. And it's amazing. It's a movie that I'm sure the two brothers themselves would enjoy. What makes this fairy tale great is a combination of light, fluffy, happy material and the dark, foreboding material, both of which are set to an amazing film score by Dario Marianelli. And let's not forget the talents of Heath Ledger and Matt Damon.<br /><br />Damon and Ledger are Wilhelm and Jacob, the famous Brothers Grimm who travel from town to town and ridding each one of a spooky, mythological monster or ghost. What the people don't realize is that the monsters and ghosts are farce, that the brothers create a spectacle about killing the famed creature to extort money from the townspeople. This practice eventually lands the boys in big trouble, and they are sent to the town of Marbaden to assist in figuring out why the children keep disappearing and why the trees in the forest are moving.  Wilhelm is scientific about the whole thing and can't believe that any of it is actually real. The trees must be moving because they are attached to some sort of device, right? Jacob believes the opposite, thinking that the forest is magical and haunted by a legendary, vain queen who was locked in the tower with no doors or steps that still looks over the entire town and forest.<br /><br />If you want to know, I suggest you get to a theater, or more practically, wait till it comes out on DVD since this movie isn't playing in many theaters right now. It's definitely worth a look, especially if you're a fan of the Brothers Grimm fairy tales. The visuals are amazing and the atmosphere, the music, the story, all make this a wonderfully magical film! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</p></body></html>

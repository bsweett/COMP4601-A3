I did not have a clue what it was going to be about, but as it started I thought it was gonnah be about a women who's made up something in her head but beleives it happend. And the film does try to make you beleive thats the case for a while. But then things pick up and more comes into play and it beacme intreaging for me with a plot that I did not know where it was going, but was anxious to keep watching and find out. The end I guess was acceptable, but I kind of was expecting things to be resolved in some kind of sci-fi confrentation, but the film leaves you with a lot un-anserwed.<br /><br />Anyway, theres nothing anyone can do to change that now. So this is a movie you might wanna see or might not, but expect the unexpected... I see there is a fair few thumbs down from reveiwers here, but make up your own mind. I'd recomend you rent it, I dont think i'd wanna own it, or watch it again anytime soon, but I think it was worth renting.</p></body></html>

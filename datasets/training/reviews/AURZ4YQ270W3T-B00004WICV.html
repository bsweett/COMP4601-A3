<meta name="summary" content="Good movie that is hamstrung by its own 'gravitas'"></head><body><p>If there ever was a movie made to win a bunch of Oscars, &quot;The Green Mile&quot; is it. It has the serious story, the serious actors, and the serious length that the Academy likes to reward with serious numbers of statuettes. <p>But it's this calculated &quot;We're making a Great, Important Film&quot; attitude that really hamstrings &quot;The Green Mile&quot;, a good film that could have been far better with less liberal doses of gravitas.<p>This isn't to say that &quot;The Green Mile&quot; doesn't have its strong points; it's beautifully made, well acted, and does have some wonderful moments.<p>To begin with, the cast is excellent. Tom Hanks turns in another wonderful everyman performance as prison death row guard Paul Edgecombe, who tries to let his charges live with as much dignity and respect as a person waiting for his turn in the electric chair can. <p>The rest of the actors portraying Edgecombe's crew are also fine, but Doug Hutchinson stands out as the smarmy, abusive Percy Wetmore, a man who most assuredly gets what he deserves. Harry Dean Stanton has a great turn as Toot Toot, a old-timer con who helps Edgecombe's crew rehearse executions. (&quot;I'm fryin! I'm a done tom turkey!&quot; he exclaims from the electric chair, as Edgecombe pretends to turn on the juice.)<p>Frank Darabont's direction is suave and self-assured; like his previous film, &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;, &quot;The Green Mile&quot; portrays prison life with just the right amount of depressing reality and everyday humanity. And though &quot;The Green Mile&quot; is too long, you have to hand it to Darabont for making the film long enough for its various characters and storylines to flesh themselves out; too bad he spent too much time focusing on Mr. Jingles, the prison's resident circus mouse.<p>The problems with &quot;The Green Mile&quot; start with Mr. Jingles and John Coffey, a huge, powerful, but barely coherent man who lands in Edgecombe's care for killing and molesting two young girls. As time goes on, it becomes apparent that John Coffey has magical healing powers (check the initials); he heals Edgecombe's urinary infection and the warden's brain tumor, and even fixes Mr. Jingles after Percy crushes him. The plot centers around Edgecombe's growing certainty that Coffey couldn't possibly be guilty of the heinous crime that landed him on death row; the Big Question - whether they can execute this guy or not - is the other plot center. <p>Michael Clarke Duncan plays Coffey as a virtual mountain of pain, and the pain shows through in every shot. Problem is, there's not much more to Coffey than pain, and that's a major failing of the film, and of Duncan's performance. Perhaps the original point of the Coffey character was to show a man who simply wanted to die, but Coffey is so depressing and one-dimensional, and dominates so many scenes, that I suspect a goodly part of the audience wanted to see him die after the first hour.<p>That brings us to the subject of length. The main criticism of &quot;The Green Mile&quot; is that it's too long, and I agree. Having said that, I don't mind long movies at all...as long as they give me fascinating characters and situations, and don't beat me about the head and face with how important they are. This is why other long movies like &quot;The Godfather&quot;, &quot;Titanic&quot;, or even &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; seem to fly by, while &quot;The Green Mile&quot; drags dutifully and laboriously onward.<p>Thankfully, Darabont wisely avoids the trap of talking too much about capital punishment; given the film's subject matter and a particularly brutal execution sequence, &quot;The Green Mile&quot; could have been an anti- (or pro-) execution manifesto. But given that that death by electric chair - a particularly grisly death AND topic if ever there was one - lurked behind every frame of this film, couldn't it have focused more on people and less on Big Themes like the Messianic Man Who Must Die?<p>Darabont's mistake wasn't making &quot;The Green Mile&quot; too long; it was filling &quot;The Green Mile&quot; with so much fluff (like the mouse), self-importance, and Great Cinema flourishes that the movie sagged under the weight of its own inflated self-expectations. That's sad, because &quot;The Green Mile&quot; could have been a lean, mean, prison fable that really would have walked off with a zillion Oscars.</p></body></html>

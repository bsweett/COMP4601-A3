<meta name="summary" content="A Cotton Candy Queen, "Marie" Is A Light And Airy Treat That Is Ultimately Less Than Satisfying"></head><body><p>I still vividly recall the abundant trailers and promos that accompanied Sofia Coppola's "Marie Antoinette" upon its theatrical release. From the gorgeous visuals, the eye popping color palette, and the anachronistic rock soundtrack--it seemed, to me, that "Marie" could be an adventurous and bold success or a complete disaster. And, in truth, as I survey the hundreds of previously submitted reviews--it does appear that people fall on one side of this spectrum or the other. So is Coppola's film a daring masterpiece or pretentious drivel? I can see a rational explanation for both points of view. However, in my case, I'll say that "Marie Antoinette" first exceeded my expectations and then let me down. holla<br /><br />I will preface my next remarks by saying that, in no way, did I go into "Marie Antoinette" anticipating a traditional historical biography. Anyone entering the film expecting great insight into Antoinette's real life or even French history is likely to be disappointed. But, seen as a bit of fiction, there are simple pleasures to be had from the film.<br /><br />The film is not nearly as radical as one might suspect. The lovely first hour tells the relatively straightforward story of Marie (Kirsten Dunst) as she leaves her home, moves to France, and takes her place as the future Queen. Seen through Marie's inexperienced eyes, the court is a place of wondrous beauty and baffling protocol. Trying to connect with her new husband Louis and maintain the spirit of her youth, Marie is an oddity that people come to accept and admire. I really enjoyed this first hour of "Marie Antoinette." Aside from the gorgeous sets and costumes, there is much charm and humor in the small details of the film's setup. However, just as I was completely captivated, the film lost all momentum. When Marie has a child, the narrative just seems to stop for a while--idling in the countryside that Marie so enjoys. And, then, as things turn more serious, the film lost me entirely. Every real issue is presented in only the vaguest of terms. Here is where a bit of valid historical context would have aided the movie tremendously. As the couple fall out of favor, I know there are dozens of significant reasons--but the film isn't at all concerned about the facts of the matter. And if the film doesn't care, why should I?<br /><br />Dunst does a nice job with Antoinette, especially in the more innocent times at court. Jason Schwartzman seems an unlikely match as husband Louis. He begins as a bit of a cartoon but has a compelling sweetness that won me over--although the "real" Louis remains a complete enigma to me. Rip Torn and Judy Davis class up the film to great affect. While both offer moments of sheer delight, I wished they were utilized even further. So while the performances are nice, the technical merits noteworthy, and the visual pleasures abundant--the screenplay ultimately loses the battle of style over substance. It's unfortunate, though, the potential for greatness was here--but, for me, "Marie Antoinette" ends up missing the mark. KGHarris, 11/07.</p></body></html>

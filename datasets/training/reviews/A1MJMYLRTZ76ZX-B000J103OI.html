If it's an accurate portrayal, it's an interesting look inside the fashion industry, the fashion moguls who drive it, and the people whose lives depend on it. The entire cast turn in very strong performances; Stanley Tucci was my favorite as Streep's artistic director, Anne Hathaway is a talented newcomer, and of course Streep practically steals the show as the boss from hell who everyone fears but loves to hate. If you're into high fashion, just watching the never-ending procession of designer clothes might be worth it by itself. The personal drama and plot revolve around a bright, young college grad who, by some strange turn of events, finds herself in apparently the most sought after and probably top entry level job in the industry as Streep's assistant, a job she really isn't suited for. Overall, it's a fine movie that provides an interesting look at what for me was a little known industry.</p></body></html>

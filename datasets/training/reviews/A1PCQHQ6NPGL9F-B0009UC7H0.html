They go to Africa for some coins and they end up having to stop a virus from destroying everything. It's really not that original.<br /><br />The characters are weak. Steve Zahn does a good job, but his antics have grown old. Matthew Mccounaghey(does anyone know how to spell this?) is cool. Penelope Cruz deserves an academy award. Just kidding, she sucked.<br /><br />As for anything I didn't mention, assume it was awful.</p></body></html>

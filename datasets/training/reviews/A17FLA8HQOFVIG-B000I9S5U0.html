Don't miss it!"></head><body><p>There seems to be a lot of boxing films around lately, and that's why I was reluctant to see Cinderella Man, but it was recommended so highly by some young cousins that I just had to see what all those accolades were about.  Well, I must say I was impressed.  This film seems to have it all, and I was completely entranced throughout its 2 hours and 25 minutes.<br /><br />Yes, this film has star power.  There's Ron Howard directing and here's Russell Crowe, Renee Zellweger and Paul Giamatti in the leads.  But most of all, the story is great.  Cinderella Man is based on the life of boxer Jim Braddock, who was riding high in the late 1920s.  We first see him as a family man, rushing home after a big win with money in his pocket to his loving wife and family.  But then Jim breaks his right hand and loses a lot of bouts.  By now, it's the depression and his family is living in poverty in a run-down basement apartment.  Jim loses his license to fight and has to work on the docks.  These dock jobs are few and far between though and every day Jim goes to a lineup where men are selected for one day's work.  Jim has a broken hand but he works anyway.  It is the only way to feed his family.  There's little to eat in the Braddock household but when his young son steals a salami from the butcher, Jim makes the child return it.  Soon, the family's electricity is turned off.  There is no heat either.  And the children are sick.  Jim has to beg money from his former colleagues.  Jim is pathetic now.  Things look bad.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti, who plays his fight manager, manages to get Jim one more fight.  It's a tough fight but Jim wins.  Then Jim keeps winning.  Eventually, he has to fight the dreaded Max Baer, played with excellent bad-guy acting by Craig Bierko.  The rest, as they say, is history.<br /><br />In addition to the story, the film really captures the depression era of the 1930s.  We feel this by the skillful crafting of many little human dramas.  It is very real, with the one exception of Ms. Zellweger's wardrobe.  Her clothes are just too clean, the fabrics too high-quality, and the design a little too upscale for this family who live in such dire need.  But after all, this is what American film making is about.  Also, these days, American film making is not always shot in America.  Cinderella Man was shot in Canada.<br /><br />To sum up, in spite of its minor shortcomings, this film is wonderful.  We all need an inspiring story right now.  Russell Crowe plays Jim Braddock as a man to admire and emulate.  Hooray for him and for everyone else connected to the film!  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

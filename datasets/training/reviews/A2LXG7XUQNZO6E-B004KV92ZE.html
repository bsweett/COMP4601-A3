<meta name="summary" content="Jack Black...A Fat Panda...C'MON!"></head><body><p>This is going to be hit or miss for some of you out there because Kung Fu may not be your thing but if it is, you're really going to have a ball watching Kung Fu Panda; it's highly entertaining, the voice actors are all top-notch and the animation is brilliant. As far as animated flicks go, it's gonna put a smile on the faces of both adults and children! I wouldn't say it delivers on non-stop hilarity but its good, clean fun for the entire family and that does seem to be missing in today's cinema these days.<br /><br />Personally I thought the best damn thing about this film was Jack Black. I'm not the biggest fan of his work but he does do comedy well and this was a fantastic role for his style of acting. Dustin Hoffman was also seriously funny as straight-man Kung Fu teacher Shifu. My personal fave though was Seth Rogen as Mantis, he didn't get a ton of lines or screen time but a Kung Fu fan always sides with the Mantis...ALWAYS. All in all, good performances all around, a satisfying conclusion and some super cool extras for the kids to check out.</p></body></html>

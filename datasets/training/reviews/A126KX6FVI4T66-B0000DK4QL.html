The ending just isn't your  "Kill Bill" blood everywhere revenge. It is a sad story with an kind of upbeat point of view with a mystery of the Mother's necklace.<br />From a Marvel comics point of view, it is an upgrade for the second line superhero, the Daredevel, to put him in the ranks of Spiderman and Batman.<br />Ben Affleck is too gentle a fellow for this type of role and probably shouldn't have been cast for it: he is more a Gary Cooper type "reluctant hero" than the revenge crazed blind man. It needed a person who has a glow of inner torment... he did a good job anyway.</p></body></html>

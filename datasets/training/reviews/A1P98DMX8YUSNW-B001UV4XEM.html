<meta name="summary" content="For a Hollywood comedy, it's above average"></head><body><p>Normally, I never laugh at so-called 'comedies," because I rarely find them anything but forced or imbecilic. This one was no exception. I may have laughed once toward the end, but I still found this entertaining enough to merit four stars. Yes, it's basically a gross-out fest, a kind of frat house film, only with all the four main characters in their early 30s or so. But the writing was better than most of those, and the acting was really the high point. These four guys can act. The plot is somewhat original. They get so drunk and high in Vegas, they can't remember the previous night, so the whole thing is a reconstruction of their hijinks. There are no weak moments.</p></body></html>

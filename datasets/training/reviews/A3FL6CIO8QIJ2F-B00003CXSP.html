<meta name="summary" content=""This Film Floors You!""></head><body><p>I recently watched "Hannibal" again and I realized I forgot how good a film this is. Directed by Ridley Scott (most famous for "Thelma and Louise") "Hannibal" stars Anthony Hopkins in the role that made him a household name. As Hannibal Lecter Mr. Hopkins is sophisticated, articulate, and most of all terrifying in his attempt to keep the FBI from recapturing him after escaping police custody in "The Silence of The Lambs". I'm not a fan of sequels but this movie works. With an excellent script "Hannibal" is one of those cinematic masterpieces both in story content and look. A lot of the film was shot in Europe and the background adds to the mood of the film. Julianne Moore replaces Jodie Foster in the Clarice Starling role and it is evident, but according to reports Foster couldn't be persuaded to return. Five minutes into the film, however, you forget a different actress is playing one of the biggest parts which is a testimony to the wonderful actress Moore is. "Hannibal" was also a boxoffice smash grossing over $350,000,000. This exquisite two disc set features an array of bonus features that will pleasure the most ardent Hannibal fan. Included is an alternate ending, commentary by Scott, over 35 minutes of deleted scenes, a great featurette on the making of the movie, TV Spots, and more. "Time" magazine calls "Hannibal"..."Thilling". There are also two prequels to "The Silence of The Lambs", the first of which is called "The Red Dragon" that recounts the story of how Lecter was originally captured and there is "Hannibal Rising" that documents Hannibal at a young age and how he became a monster. Both films are worth purchasing.</p></body></html>

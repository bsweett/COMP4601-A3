<meta name="summary" content="Rocky Balboa"></head><body><p>`Rocky Balboa' is a pretty credible addition to the Rocky series which has a decent story, decent direction and decent acting from Stallone. Considering he wrote, directed and starred in this film that's not bad going at all. Following Rocky as he fights a comeback `exhibition' fight with the reigning world champion, this film has plenty of fight scenes and Rocky training with the usual rousing soundtrack to add to the atmosphere. Stallone shows Rocky's motivation for wanting to fight again and his relationship with his son to good effect and the whole film builds on the Rocky franchise, whilst also redeeming itself against some of the more dubious sequels. Overall, if you're a fan of the Rocky films this shouldn't disappoint and if you're new to Rocky you can still watch this and get some enjoyment out of it without being aware of the full back story. Worth a look.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

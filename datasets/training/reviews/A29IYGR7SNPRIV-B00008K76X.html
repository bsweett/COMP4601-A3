Ben Affleck looks as if he somehow wandered into the wrong production and isn't sure what to do about it. Aside from everything else, he lacks the gravitas that Harrison Ford brought to his roles in the Clancy films.<p>It's a manipulative effort that tries to play upon everyone's worst fear: that of nuclear war, but succeeds only in being silly. The climax relies upon computer communications that could never possibly happen; the plot is so thin you can see daylight through it. There are some decent special effects but even combining the few positive aspects there are do not make this worth seeing.<p>Don't waste your money. Go see The Bourne Identity instead; it, at least, is entertaining.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Different Superhero Movie From Spiderman"></head><body><p>I hadn't seen the first X-Men movie, I have heard of it, so I just checked "X2" out and it was pretty good. I was never a fan of the animated X-Men series. I think besides Spiderman, it's great for the genre. The sci-fi/fantasy/action genre certainly is an extraordinary type. Just like Star Wars. One character I was quite fond of was the Nightcrawler AKA Kurt Wagner played by the neato actor Alan Cumming. I've read the trivia for this movie and it said that it took 10 hours to get his makeup on. Also, this movie is in the Guiness Book of World Records for being the movie that had the widest release on opening day: 3,741 screens! It's no wonder. I thought Lord of The Rings would have done something effective like that.<br /><br />Warning: The awesome action in this film can be head-spinning.</p></body></html>

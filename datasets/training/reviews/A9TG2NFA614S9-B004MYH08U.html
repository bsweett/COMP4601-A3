<meta name="summary" content="Kato Saves This One"></head><body><p>"The Green Hornet" (2011) shown in 3D features Seth Rogen as Britt Reid who becomes The Green Hornet. He's the kind of over-the-top comic who can become very annoying and exasperating if you're not on his wave length. It helps if you have an adolescent fondness for zany and oafish playground humor. The real star of the movie is Jay Chou as Kato.<br /> Britt is a party animal who who lives a wasted existence until his tyrannical father, James Reid (Tom Wilkinson), mysteriously kicks the bucket via a bee sting. Britt inherits the family newspaper. When he meets his father's chauffeur, the brainy Kato who has designed fantastic cars, Britt decides to be a crime fighter, but to be different, he chooses to be a vigilante. With his inherited newspaper he can build up the Green Hornet as a bad guy. Kato builds a car, the Black Beauty, which has more gizmos, gadgets, and armament than any James Bond vehicle.<br /> Britt is a klutz, a know-it-all who knows nothing. He can't fight. He thinks he's great, is an egomaniac who after Kato beats up a gang of toughs tries to take the credit and denigrate his sidekick, but Kato has spunk and won't sit back and be a flunky. Kato is a terrific martial arts fighter and seems to have super powers. He can whip up elaborate inventions in a few days. He's the muscle and brains of that outfit.<br /> Britt thinks he can get any woman he wants, but he better look out for Kato. The movie has a love interest, but you'll be surprised at who ends up with the girl.<br /> There's way too much mayhem in this, and the car violence gets tiresome. The Green Hornet seems to wipe out as many cops as bad guys.<br /> If this movie succeeds, I can see sequels lying in wait, but they could very quickly become tiresome just as this film does. Parts are boring and Rogen can wear down the moviegoer who's not on his whiny track. He's a comic playing a comic book hero, but playing the character for laughs can be dangerous. It's part of the crime-fighter and sidekick genre played for yacks more than kicks. There's some crude stuff not for kids.<br /> Britt as a youngster was humiliated when his father took his toy caped superhero doll and tore the head off it. So what does the boy-man do as his first super-hero stunt? He cuts the head off a statue placed in his father's honor at the gravesite.<br /> It's a goofy movie so be prepared. Get ready for lots of mad-cap action, wild car chases, explosions, yucks and jokes. There's a monumental fight between Kato and Britt. No one could possibly escape from that melee without bruises and wounds, but these two do. The villains chasing the fearless duo in the newspaper plant is a long scene that could be condensed. The film is too long and drawn-out and needs closer editing and tightening.</p></body></html>

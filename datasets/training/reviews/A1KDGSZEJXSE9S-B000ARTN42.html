<meta name="summary" content="Great movie"></head><body><p>Russell Crowe stars as James Braddick a boxer that for the bulk of his career didn't live up to his potential. After getting thrown out of boxing he struggles to make ends meet in the depression era.<br /><br />After figuring out how to fight with his left hand he gets a second chance when a fighter dropps out of a fight and James proceeds to fight his way to the top where he fights from the championship of the world and inspires millions of people.<br /><br />10/10<br /><br />I don't get the negitive reviews... Some of them are just spammers, but some others are complaining about some fiction in there. It's a MOVIE... NOT a documentary. Do you people understand the difference between a documentary and a movie?<br /><br />It doesn't seem as if some of you do.</p></body></html>

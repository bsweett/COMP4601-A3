<meta name="summary" content="A funny movie"></head><body><p>A funny movie that is for both women and men.  Will Smith and Kevin James who is one of my favorite comedians are great in this movie.  Very funny and is a perfect date movie to take your girlfriend or wife which I did take my girlfriend, her cousin, and her cousins boyfriend to see.  She liked it, I liked it, her cousin liked it, and her cousin's boyfriend liked it.  Eva Mendes, Amber Valletta, and Julie Ann Emery are hot.</p></body></html>

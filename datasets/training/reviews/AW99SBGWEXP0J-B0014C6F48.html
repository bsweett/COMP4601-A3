<meta name="summary" content="13 Going on 30"></head><body><p>In 1987, after a disasterous thirteenth birthday party, Jenna Rink wishes she could just be 30 years old and skip the next seventeen years.  A sprinkle of pixie dust gives her that wish, and when she awakens, she quickly finds out that her with has come true.  The year is 2004, and Jenna (Garner) is an editor for Poise magazine and best friends with Lucy (Greer), the popular girl from her teenage years.  In a panic, she seeks out her childhood best friend Matt (Ruffalo).  Unfortunately for her, their friendship ended badly years ago.  Reluctantly, he agrees to help her, and Jenna soon discovers feelings for him that she never had before.<p>Yes, we have seen this movie before.  Big, anyone?  But what this movie has that really makes it enjoyable is Jennifer Garner.  She imbues thirty year old Jenna with the spirit of a thirteen year old.  Her channelling of her inner child is what really makes this movie work.  Also, the movie doesn't take itself too seriously.  After all, the "time travel" is accomplished with pixie dust.  This is a sweet and funny movie that shows Jennifer Garner can do comedy as well as action.</p></body></html>

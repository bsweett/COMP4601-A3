<meta name="summary" content="well paced thriller"></head><body><p>The plot is simple, but it works.  Robin Williams as a photo developer who is obsessed with one of his customer's family photo's and the family itself.  His obsession leads to strange turn of events.  The film tackles one man's loneliness and how jealousy over what someone else appears to have can lead to problems.  The film definitely showcases Robin Williams acting ability.  It's the first thriller suspense film that I have seen in a long time which has been so absorbing.<p>Creepy, clever and engaging. Worth seeing.</p></body></html>

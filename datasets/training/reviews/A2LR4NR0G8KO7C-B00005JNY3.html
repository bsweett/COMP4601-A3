The pictures of the traditional southamerican scenery are nice, but I cannot recall a single frightening moment in this entire movie. Isn't a ghost story supposed to be scary anymore these days? I feel as if this movie could have been a lot scarier than it was. It was like watching North and South with a touch of voodoo/hoodoo.(SARR)</p></body></html>

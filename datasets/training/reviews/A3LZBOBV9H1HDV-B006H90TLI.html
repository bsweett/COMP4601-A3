This is how the story goes: Violence and mayhem ensue after a hunter stumbles upon some dead bodies, a stash of heroin and more than $2 million in cash near the Rio Grande. The cast led by Tommy Lee Jones (excellent as Sheriff Ed Tom Bell), Javier Bardem (chillingly brilliant as Anton Chigurh), and Josh Brolin (impressive as Llewelyn Moss) is brilliant! The screenplay (based on Cormac McCarthy's novel), directing and film editing (under the name Roderick Jaynes) by Joel And Ethan Coen (who also wrote and directed "O Brother, Where Are Thou?" (2000) (also film edited), "Fargo" (1996) (also film edited and won Oscar for Best Original Screenplay), "The Big Lebowski" (1998) (also film edited), "Blood Simple." (1984) (also film edited), "The Ladykillers" (2004) (also film edited), "Intolerable Cruelty" (2003) (also film edited), "The Man Who Wasn't There" (2001) (also film edited), "The Hudsucker Proxy" (1994), "Barton Fink" (1991) (also film edited), "Miller's Crossing" (1990), & "Raising Arizona" (1987), they also directed, wrote, and film edited the upcoming "Burn After Reading" (2008) & "Hail Caesar" (2009) is brilliant! The music by Carter Burwell (who has composed all of the Coen brothers' films) is brilliant! The cinematography by Roger Deakins (who also did the cinematography to "The Ladykillers", "Intolerable Cruelty", "The Man Who Wasn't There", "O Brother, Where Art Thou?", "The Big Lebowski", "Fargo", "The Hudsucker Proxy" & "Barton Fink", he also did the cinematography to the upcoming "Hail Caesar") is brilliant! The casting by Ellen Chenoweth (who also did the casting to "The Ladykillers", "Intolerable Cruelty", "The Man Who Wasn't There", "O Brother, Where Art Thou?", and the upcoming "Burn After Reading") is brilliant! The production design by Jess Gonchor (who also did the production design to the upcoming "Burn After Reading") is brilliant! The art direction by John P. Goldsmith is brilliant! The set decoration by Nancy Haigh (who also did the set decoration to "The Ladykillers", "Intolerable Cruelty", "O Brother, Where Art Thou?", "The Hudsucker Proxy", "Barton Fink", "Miller's Crossing" and the upcoming "Burn After Reading") is brilliant! The costume design by Mary Zophres (who also did the costume design to "The Ladykillers", "Intolerable Cruelty", "The Man Who Wasn't There", "O Brother, Where Art Thou?", "The Big Lebowski" and the upcoming "Burn After Reading") is brilliant! This is the best film of the year, so far, even though, the year is almost up. All three of the performances by Jones, Brolin, and especially Bardem, who gives the best performance of his career thus far, as does Brolin and Jones. The Coens, Bardem and Bardem's co-stars should be remembered when Oscar nominations and Oscar night roll around. This is the Coen Brothers' best film of the career, even ahead of "Fargo" and "Blood Simple". This is a well-crafted thriller that will keep you thinking and wanting you to see it again. This is a brilliant masterpiece.</p></body></html>

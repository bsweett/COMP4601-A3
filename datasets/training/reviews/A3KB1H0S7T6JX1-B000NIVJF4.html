<meta name="summary" content="More relevant than ever!"></head><body><p>The Last King of Scotland sheds light on one of the most well known African dictators, General Idi Amin Dada of Uganda, who ruled from 1971 to 1979.<br />A Scot doctor arrives in Africa upon graduating from University in order to distance himself from his overprotective family as well as get a feel of adventure.  In Uganda he witnesses the military coup d'etat that brings Idi Amin to power.  Upon stumbling across the new leader by chance he renders his medical services and before he knows it he becomes the Ugandan leader's personal physician.  His problems, however, have just started...<br />James McAvoy, Forest Whitaker, Gillian Anderson (who looks great after losing weight and going blonde), and the rest of the cast carry out their respective roles very well.<br />More relevant than ever, the movie does a great job as an eye-opener to one of the most brutal leaders the Dark Continent has seen in the twentieth century.  The film provides the necessary background as well as an accurate description of political and social conditions therein.  British involvement is briefly touched upon, but nevertheless provides for some important insight.<br />Moreover, it could have been and it should have been much more graphic in showing what really took place in Uganda's "killing fields."<br />Hopefully more will be done to stop the ongoing genocide in the Darfur region of Western Sudan and we will not have to wait for another movie to come out after it's all over before people become aware and do that which is humane.<br />Similarly to movies like The Lord of War, Hotel Rwanda, and Blood Diamond to name a few, The Last King of Scotland draws attention to some very important issues facing Africa.</p></body></html>

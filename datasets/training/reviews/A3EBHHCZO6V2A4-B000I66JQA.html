<meta name="summary" content="The Hours of Our Lives"></head><body><p>"The Hours" is a quiet, meditative piece about what makes life worth living. It unites the stories of three women- Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman), struggling with suicidal thoughts, Laura Brown (Julianne Moore), expecting a child and struggling with her desires, and Clarissa (Meryl Streep), who's watching her ex-husband die from AIDS. The trio of women share a self-destructive streak. Ironically, and powerfully, the movie is about living life.<br /><br />Virginia dotes on her husband, Leonard, yet she feels passionately for other women. She authored "Orlando" in honor of her onetime lover Vita Sackville-West. She is writing "Mrs. Dalloway." In the '50s, Laura is expecting a child with her boring but gentle husband (a brilliant, understated John C. Reilly) However, it is her bosomy neighbor (Toni Collette) who awakens her conflicted desires. Laura considers suicide. Realizing the unborn life within her, and reading "Mrs. Dalloway", she chooses life.  In 2001, Clarissa is caring for her ex-husband, who's suffering from AIDS (Ed Harris) She cannot understand his profound pain. Though he has a boyfriend (Jeff Daniels,in a surprisingly good turn) and she has a girlfriend (Alison Janney),they still have a spousal bond. He calls her "Mrs. Dalloway." The underlying mystery is--what links the three women?<br /><br />"The Hours" seems to glorify suicide, from Kidman drowning herself to Harris hurtling himself off a window ledge. However, it is Laura's choice for life that gives the story's three threads their essential link. Life makes connectedness possible. The hypnotic music from Philip Glass is excellent. Moore, Kidman, Streep, and Harris give luminous performances.<br /><br />"The Hours" is a contemplative masterpiece.</p></body></html>

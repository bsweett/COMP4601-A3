The visuals are stunning, and the musical soundtrack really enhances the film. Leonardo's performance is a powerful one, as well as the rest of the cast. Here's the major problem though, after screening the film, for the second time, it starts to fall apart about halfway through the film. By the end of the film, the storyline doesn't really make all that much sense, leaving the audience less than satisfied, with the way the story turns out.</p></body></html>

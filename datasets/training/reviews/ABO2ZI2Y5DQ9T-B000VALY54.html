<meta name="summary" content="Kiss Kiss Bang Bang: Witty and Clever Modern-Day Noir with Superb Leading Actors"></head><body><p>In "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" you get everything you want to see on screen; murders, actions, wickedly funny dialogues, two cool guys and one beautiful lady, Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr. are superb an incongruous pair who find themselves caught in the intrigues of the underworld in LA. Plus, the film is directed by a person who knows the industry of Hollywood, so what else do you need?<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. is Harry, a thief who has managed to escape from the police by being mistaken for a method actor. After flying to LA, he meets a PI named Gay (Val Kilmer) and his (Harry's) childhood friend Harmony (Michelle Monaghan). The convoluted story unfolds in a film-noir fashion after Harry stumbles upon two dead bodies in three hours. Obviously he is in trouble, but how?<br /><br />Writer/director Shane Black's screenplay is full of violence, but like "Pulp Fiction" the violence is of comic-book kind, nothing you should take seriously. The film is also successful in surprising us with unexpected twists and turns of the narrative and the tone of the story, which is sometimes very dark, and then suddenly becomes uproariously.<br /><br />There are references to Hollywood or noir genre, but Shane Black cleverly avoids the pitfalls of making it too self-referential (like so many cameos popping up). Instead he created an intriguing trio of characters integral to the story, which is the driving force of the film. The three leads are all fantastic, and I knew Robert Downey Jr.'s talent for credibly showing a variety of emotions of the character, but I never knew Val Kilmer could be so good with a nuanced performance, which is also a great asset of the film. And don't forget sexy and delightful Michelle Monaghan, who is much better than in `Mission Impossible III."<br /><br />"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang" is, as its title suggests, a modern version of noir film made with wit and humor, exactly what "Miami Vice" should have been.</p></body></html>

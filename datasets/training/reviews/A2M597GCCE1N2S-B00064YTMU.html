<meta name="summary" content="Jamie Fox shines and Cruise is masterful....."></head><body><p>Everyonce in a while there comes along a movie that just seems to capture someone's attention with the suspense, the action, the acting, and the drama so well that they don't know what's going to happen next nor do they want someone to spoil it who's already seen it.<br /><br />Collateral is the perfect example of that type of movie. Both Jamie Fox and Tom Cruise share chemistry together so well you'd might think they have been doing dozens of movies together.<br /><br />I haven't seen too many Cruise movies; just Top Gun and the Mission Impossble series, and I thought Jamie Fox couldn't get on the same level as he did in Ray, but this movie was awesome to watch and see what both men could do.<br /><br />Jamie Fox stars as a cab driver named Max; a man who has the cleanest cab in Los Angeles. The first few minutes show how Fox can carry a regular cab scene with ease, and proves it when he shows his character's background who wants to open a limo driving business. [Don't worry, he actually is serious in the movie]<br /><br />Max picks up a man named Vincent; played by Cruise, who gives him three hundred dollars up front to make five stops, "To visit some friends" It basically is a typical scene, till Max gets a rather nasty shock on his first stop [I wont give what it was away, but it is rather surprising]<br /><br />To make a long story short, Cruise is a hit man on his way to five different people. His protrayal of Vincent is astonishingly cold, cool, and cruel. He will kill anyone who gets in his way and he informs Max that in order to save those people, "Don't attract anyone who doesn't need to die's attention." Seems easier said than done with what Max has to go through.<br /><br />The camera angles are unique and styllized but the lighting is probably the only thing that I have a problem with. The whole plot takes place at night save a few minutes at the beginning and the end, showing when the plot begins and end.<br /><br />And there is a scene near the end when vincent is chasing another victim where it is really hard to see. But besides those small minor details this is one pretty good movie with great camera angles.<br /><br />To sum everything up I would definately reccomend this movie to those who want to see a styllized action flick with the most regular good vs. evil plot you might see. The action is great, the suspense is nail biting, the acting is off the charts, and the ending is powerful to say the least.</p></body></html>

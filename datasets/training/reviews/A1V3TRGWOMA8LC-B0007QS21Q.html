<meta name="summary" content="I, Popcorn"></head><body><p>Cliches reign in this 'Who the hell is Asimov?' sci-fi flick that poses the question 'how many unnecessary camera moves can we do in one fx shot?'. Rock out with some of my favorites:<br /><br />1. Open on a drowning scene involving our hero, which gets explained in flashback through the movie to the main reflection character.<br />2. The hero is a cop who lives alone but visits his 'heart of gold' grandmother in order to show his family's died, he's a loner, or just give us an excuse for dialog.<br />3. Hero actually says to sidekick 'We're not so different, you and I.' (Hero has a robot arm, presumably so he felt some degree of sympathy in an early draft of the script that got trashed.)<br />4. Hardened but good-natured black cop boss (oh for the 70s) actually says to hero 'Give me your badge'.<br />5. In classic B-movie/Outer Limits style, the world's biggest company is run by one evil man and about 3 other people. And - of course - he's not evil after all.<br /><br />Bridget Whatever-her-name-is couldn't act her way out of a paper bag; even James Cromwell looks embarrassed as a hologram. Some of the parallels with slavery and genocide are overworked and unneeded.<br /><br />But it has a couple of enjoyable sequences even though the robots look fake now (they looked good at the time). Btw, 'I am Legend' has continued the trend where we get to hang out with Smith in his undies while he works out, admires his own body, listens to music and showers because he's just *that* cool.</p></body></html>

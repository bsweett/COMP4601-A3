<meta name="summary" content="Quite Atrocious To Watch"></head><body><p>I am a complete ABBA fan, so the thought of watching the movie "Mamma Mia!" sounded right up my alley!! Plus the idea of a story revolving around Abba's songs was a novel idea too, which was another reason I was game for watching this movie.<br /><br />Okay, let's just say the story line is cheesy! The singing was horrible and the acting was bad on all counts.... I would have thought with the all star cast of Meryl Streep, Colin Firth, Pierce Brosnan, Christine Barabski, Julie Walters, and so on that this movie would have been great... at the very least acting wise!!<br /><br />I say skip the movie and listen to Abba's Greatest Hits!!</p></body></html>

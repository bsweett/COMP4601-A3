<meta name="summary" content="Incredibly good!"></head><body><p>I had highly anticipated seeing "The Incredibles" after seeing the trailer of Mr. Incredible himself trying to get his belt buckled and trying to convince himself and the wife he just wants salad for dinner, with maybe some rice cakes.<br /><br />Anyways, ironically enough, that scene wasn't even in the movie.  I believe it will be seen in the dvd version as a 'deleted scene' as I honestly don't remember seeing it in that 1 1/2 hours of film time.  You heard correctly, it's a full- length feature film and just because it's animated doesn't mean it's something just for kids. I've been a Pixar fan since "Toy Story", and I didn't have any kids at that time.  So , I warn parents of small children - You may have yourself a tough time trying to get toddling kiddies or drooling babies to sit through this one.<br /><br />My son, who is almost 4, was entranced..he loved it. His ending review was in one word: Awesome.<br /><br />Being a fan of cartoons, superheroes(watching super friends every saturday am growing up), and the everchanging face of the animated film, I have to agree with my roving movie reviewing son.<br /><br />It was the idea of 'retired' superheros, who come back to save the world that struck me as a unique idea for a movie. Plus, seeing one of them get way out of shape and then whip himself back into shape is one of the funniest parts of the movie.<br /><br />It did drag a bit, but I felt very much entertained by most parts.  It was an overall good time at the movies.<br /><br />I recommend it to ages 4 and up.</p></body></html>

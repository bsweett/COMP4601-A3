<meta name="summary" content="another bomb from Hilary Swank"></head><body><p>I have no idea why there has to be yet another take on the Black Dahlia, and Brian De Palma seems to have completely lost any ability to make remotely interesting anything anymore.<br /><br />To top it off, I don't know what Hollywood sees in Hilary Swank at all. First of all, are they all blind. This is not a sexy attractive woman and yet she plays a femme fatale in this.<br /><br />Throw in the whole Scarlett Johansson, Josh Harnett, Aaron Eckhart what is the deal with them? Are they living a polyamorous lifestyle? It's never fully revealed and I couldn't figure out if it was implied or what it had to do with anything. She's wasted in this role and she should have played the femme fatale character.<br /><br />Anyway, it's a complete mess and looks as flat as a made-for-TV movie.<br /><br />Could we put to rest any more Black Dahlia movies. Wasn't the 1975 movie Who Is The Black Dahlia starring Efrem "FBI" Zimbalist Jr. enough?</p></body></html>

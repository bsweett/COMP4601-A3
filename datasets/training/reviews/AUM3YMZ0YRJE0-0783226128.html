Not only is it based on crude stereotypes of the Latin American underworld, but it is ridiculously unrealistic.  I mean, when all the shooting starts - let alone whether Pacino and his minions could operate with such blatant impunity - where were the cops?<br /><br />So what the story boils down to is:  bad guys rise and then fall.  Or is it: don't get high off your own supply?  Or:  don't wish for what you want because you might get it?<br /><br />THere is nothing in this but brutality and violence.  Not recommended.</p></body></html>

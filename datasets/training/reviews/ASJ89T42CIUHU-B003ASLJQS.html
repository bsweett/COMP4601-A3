<meta name="summary" content="A River of Tears and Confusion"></head><body><p>I found this film to be disturbing, haunting and quite confusing.<p>Clint Eastwood did a great job directing this film, allowing the actors to take on the character's personas with stunning ability. He also kept extremely close to life as it exists in the Boston suburbs, nothing fancy or colorful, just an average working class living. The actors were cast in nearly perfect roles for their vulnerabilities. Eastwood allowed the story to evolve without pushing but I wish he would have included more explanation and a more thorough ending.<p>Sean Penn is PERFECT in his role and I can see why he received an Oscar. He is open and raw with his feelings, in fact so much so that your heart is almost wrenched from your own chest as a few of his scenes are played out. Tim Robbins edged upon scary as his character dealt with the consequences of his childhood. Kevin Bacon seemed a little too reserved and I kept expecting him to open up and really act at some but sadly he never did. The wives are all a little too sappy for my taste and seemed to agree with whatever their crazy husbands decided to do so I was disapointed by their characters. <p>This film is good and mysterious but sort of leaves one hanging at the end with many strings seemingly unconnected that should have been. Sean Penn's performance is well worth the watch however. At least I was eventually able to figure out where the title &quot;Mystic River&quot; came from, but as for the rest of my questions I will search for them in the novel.</p></body></html>

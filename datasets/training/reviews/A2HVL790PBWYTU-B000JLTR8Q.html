<meta name="summary" content="This movie is murky, but still worth watching"></head><body><p>There is something strange going on at an apartment complex in Philadelphia. Sprinklers keep getting set off and building super Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti) hears splashing noises from the pool at night. One evening, he finds that these noises are being caused by a sea nymph (Bryce Dallas Howard) residing in the water. He befriends her and comes to learn that she is a narf, a fragile fairy tale creature from the Blue World, trying desperately to return home. But, first, she has a purpose she must carry out here in the "real" world. She must locate the Chosen One, a writer who will someday change the world (guess who plays that role?). A nightmarish monster called a scrunt is after her, intent on keeping her trapped in this world. The stuttering, unassuming Cleveland Heep and several apartment tenants band together and attempt to help the despairing damsel in distress. But things get even weirder and more frightening when they realize that they, too, are part of a bedtime story. According to storytime lore, the narf can summon to her aid a Protector, a Guide, a Healer, and the Guild. Somewhere in the building are these people, somehow having been drawn to the narf. Cleveland must find them before time runs out.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti (Sideways) is perfectly good as the everyman lead character and he carries the movie as best he can. His Cleveland Heep is no macho hero; he is very self-effacing. He's the kind of guy who passes you by on the streets without eliciting a second of your thoughts. And he has a secret. The willowy Bryce Dallas Howard (The Village, Book of Love) imbues her character Story (yes, Story) with a sense of otherwordly presence. In regarding Story, adjectives such as "waiflike," "gossamery," and "ethereal" inevitably pop up. The third character to make an impact on me is Bill Irwin as Mr. Leeds, the pompous movie critic who delivers a humorous monologue before getting his come-uppance.<br /><br />Writer/Director/BooMaster M. Night Shyamalan has had his share of cinematic homeruns (The 6th Sense, Signs) and strike outs (Unbreakable, The Village), so I didn't know what to expect walking into The Lady in the Water. After two hours, I walked out with a perplexed feeling of "Huh! Is that it?" This definitely is a beautifully crafted movie in terms of how it looks on the screen. But it's a mess. Shyamalan clearly has things of deep meaning he wants to convey but his story comes off as stilted, contrived, and a bit self-serving.<br /><br />I found myself drowning in the writer/director's feel-good formula of destiny and belief in one's sense of purpose. Done right, I would've welcomed his message. As it is, it comes off as pretentious. Shyamalan's world building (fairy tale building?) here is poorly done, with storybook details coming abruptly out of left field. Cleveland has a question about something? Boom, just go to the disgruntled Asian mother in the building, who has extensive knowledge of the narf fairy tale. The pace of the movie is plodding. There are too many onerous, drawn out sequences wherein Cleveland just knocks on doors and has conversations with tenants. These talks do pay off in the end, but c'mon...some editing, please. Too much time is spent on Cleveland trying to riddle out who exactly are the archetypal characters who will save Story. I also found it astounding that everyone in the film instantly took the fairy tale premise in stride. In the last half hour or so, the film becomes even more unfocused as people who, before, only had fleeting  moments of camera time now all of a sudden become key to the storyline. And don't tell me you didn't see the identity of the Healer coming a mile away.<br /><br />Shyamalan, fortunately, still has the ability to take you on a creepy excursion in his spook house. He still knows how to mesh musical score, camera angles and built-in viewer anticipation to set up a good scare. There were a few times when I almost jumped in my seat. But, sadly, these moments are not enough to tide the movie over. Also, the ending felt a bit too abrupt. Instead of being a clarion call to the imagination, Lady in the Lake muddles up the pool and leaves you treading water in the dark.<br /><br />Do I recommend it? Well, yes, actually I do. As I've said, it's still a beautiful movie and its heart is in the right place. And it's worth watching for Paul Giamatti's riveting, masterful performance alone. But, yeah, it could've been better. Three and a half stars.</p></body></html>

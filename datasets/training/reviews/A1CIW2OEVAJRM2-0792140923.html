<meta name="summary" content="Typical Hollywood.  Typical America."></head><body><p>Forrest Gump is the story of the life of a retarded man who lives through epic events in American history: JFK, Nixon, Vietnam War, etc.  His life touches most of these significant ways, such as by accidentally discovering Watergate.  He becomes famous after rescuing several soldiers in the Vietnam War, and achieving remarkable success in international ping pong.  But his heart's desire is his childhood friend Jenny, who is one of the few who shows compassion to him.<p>The insight into the life of a retarded man is wonderful.  And the acting, particularly of Tom Hanks in acting Forrest Gump, is remarkable.  Some of the special effects (eg the ping pong playing, the inclusion of Forrest Gump in real newscasts of US presidents, John Lennon, etc) are astounding.  The DVD features an explanation of how these special effects were accomplished, and they truly are outstanding.  The concept is great, but the way it is worked out is a typical Hollywood disappointment.<p>Because these are the only positives about the movie.  Several concerns:<br />1. Adult themes.  The rating is only PG 13, but there are many scenes with violence, drugs, nudity and sex, themes inappropriate for children.  The language is mostly reasonable, but there are multiple incidences of strong blasphemy and foul language.<br />2. Lack of moral absolutes.  Forrest Gump represents innocence and naivity, but yet he is corrupted by Jenny, whom he eventually sleeps with.  Even after he fathers her child outside of wedlock, she assures him that he has done nothing wrong. Jenny's death is apparently due to her lifestyle (due to her drug problems, STDs or AIDS?), and yet the dangerous consequences of an ungodly lifestyle are never connected or clearly spelled out.  She seems to represent all the dangerous things of the sixties.<br />3. Atheism.  Gump is one of the few individuals who believes in God, but this is presented as part of his retarded thinking, which like in other areas, is out of date and inaccurate.  This is especially clear in a blasphemous scene where his friend challenges God to sink his boat.  As it turns out, God loses, because every boat is sunk except theirs, and they become millionaires as a result.  Christianity is clearly presented as irrelevant for modern life.<br />4. Self-determinism.  The movie starts and ends with a fluttering feather.  It's a very religious symbol, as the movie itself explains with several discussions about "destiny".  Destiny is partly the random fluttering of fate, and what you make of it yourself.  Forrest partly triumphs by his character, but also the whims of fate (eg the success of his shrimping company is pure "chance" after all other boats sink).  God's involvement in the world is clearly rejected in favour of self-determinism.  This is a strong theme in the movie, and a dangerous one.<br />5. Trivialization.  Key events of American history are presented through Gump's eyes.  While it gives insight into a retarded man, at the same time these key events are downplayed and presented as trite and almost laughable.  Some of the most important and emotional events of the 20th century are trivialized.  This reflects the failure of most Americans to treat life with the seriousness it deserves.<p>All in all, while this movie had aspects of warm humour, it also showed the spiritual bankruptcy of a modern America that has rejected God and is no longer rooted to moral absolutes.  The fact that this was awarded the Best Picture in 1993 and received a bag-load of Academy Awards just proves that it is indeed representative of modern thinking.  Interestingly some critics believe that this movie is an attack on liberalism, lambasting promiscuity, atheism, and the entire counter-culture of the 60s.  I wish it was, but the very fact of its immense popularity among modern viewers suggests that - sadly - this is not the case.  It's a sad reflection of modern American, and its popularity just confirms how accurate this portrait really is.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Chris Columbus' second solid Rowling romp"></head><body><p>This second Harry Potter film is a fine adventure, and this two-disk DVD edition has fun features. Disc One contains the film (you have to purchase widescreen or fullscreen rather than getting both on one disc -- what's up with that?), which can be heard in English or Spanish, or read in English, Spanish or French. The disc also contains a cast and crew listing (which includes neither Moaning Myrtle nor Mr. Weasley!); a theatrical trailer; and an entertaining synopsis trailer of the first film.<p>Disc Two navigates easily and contains a number of good items, including: an enlightening 16-minute conversation with author Rowling and screenwriter Kloves; charming interview snippets from virtually every speaking actor; production sketches; a photo gallery; a 17-minute behind-the-scenes featurette of the production team as they tackle Dumbledore's Office; Lockhart's Classroom, a facsimile replete with certificates, books and pictures all concerning Magical Him; a quiz; an interactive tour of Diagon Alley that lumbers a bit through Navigation Alley but contains clever images; and two games, one getting through the Chamber of Secrets, the other navigating the flying car through the forest -- the latter looks really fabulous. Nineteen additional scenes are available, and they are a lot of fun. I wish several had been used in the theatrical release, including a fine bridge between (a) Hermione's telling Harry he could, indeed, be the heir of Slytherin, and (b) Harry's feeling the curious stares of his housemates; the scene is beautiful -- Harry looking forlornly out over a Lake District-y looking place. I think it's a scene that could easily have been overplayed, but Radcliffe pulled it off nicely.  It convinced me that Radcliffe may grow in the role and benefit from another director.  (I'd love to see Tim Burton tackle an instalment!)  I think all three young leads are better this time around, and of course the entire supporting cast is flawless. Sets and props are inspired, and the effects are breathtaking. Tom Riddle's wordy denouement is less successful on the screen than it was in the book, but therein lies the difference in the mediums. <p>All in all, I'd say this DVD set is lots of fun. The film is very good and the extras are quite entertaining. <p>Caveat: the movie may be too intense for young viewers, people who don't like spiders, or people who don't like snake-ish things.</p></body></html>

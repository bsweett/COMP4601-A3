That's why we should be thankful for Let the Right One In, a Swedish import that puts a thoughtful, haunting, and surprisingly touching stamp on vampire lore.  The film revolves around Oskar (K?re Hedebrant), a twelve year old who is constantly bullied and yearns for revenge against his tormenters.  He comes across a girl named Eli (Lina Leandersson), who over time he learns to be a vampire, and with whom he finds both love and a method of vengeance.  If it sounds like Twilight to you at all, just ignore that thought.  Let the Right One In can be considered what an adult take on Twilight could be, with brilliant performances, a dark and poetic tone, and an actually thought provoking screenplay.  Tomas Alfredson's direction is hypnotic as well, luring the viewer into this world that also manages to provide a good amount of shocks as well.  Rumor has it that this film is being fast-tracked to be remade for American audiences.  If that is the case (which I certainly hope it isn't) then it is also all the more reason that you should check out Let the Right One In.  It is a brilliant, thought provoking film that soars well above its genre, and it deserves your time and attention.  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a modern day classic.</p></body></html>

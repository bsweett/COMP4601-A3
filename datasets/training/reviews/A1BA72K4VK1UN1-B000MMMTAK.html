<meta name="summary" content="The most hilarious film ever made, bar none!"></head><body><p>I'm not here to launch detailed film review as I normally do... and I definitely won't endeavor to point out the nonstop political incorrectness of this crazy film. I just chiefly wanted to convey that this is the most hilarious, side-splitting film I've ever seen in my half-Century (+) on the planet.<br /><br />THE STORY: Borat is a television commentator in Kazakhstan and he comes to America with his producer on a shoestring budget to document life here. He starts out in New York City but he quickly decides to head for California where his true Hollywood love is involved in the television industry (Baywatch). He encounters BIG TROUBLE (based upon his crude cultural background) everywhere he goes. It's that simple.<br /><br />My brother and I watched this movie yesterday and both of us laughed so hard from beginning to end that we had to watch the movie a second time to hear all the stuff we failed to attend during the first round from laughing too loudly. Neither of us is a contemporary film fan (both of us are retired cops) but we avow to make a big exception here. We had tears in our eyes and could barely catch our breath -- it's that funny.<br /><br />Is this 2006 film for everyone? Well no, the kiddies will have to be nudged out of the room (and out of earshot as well) and I assume that there are women, minorities, devout Christians, and other folks who are particularly sensitive to ethnic remarks and incendiary language who will abhor this one. I'd say that most people will come down on this movie firmly on one side or the other, with few on the fence.<br /><br />So, there's some pretty provocative nudity and the language is akin to what you might expect to hear from an angry and drunken Portuguese Stevedore. Heck, the antics themselves are pretty provocative. But in the end, if you don't care about all that stuff, it's just a movie, folks -- if you think that this presentation would offend you, just don't watch it.<br /><br />All others RUN... don't walk, RUN to the video store and rent or buy this crazy film! Family Dollar Stores are selling pre-viewed copies for six bucks and I've seen them elsewhere too. Make sure to get the widescreen version -- 84 minutes of rolling-on-the-floor-and-you-know-what-else.</p></body></html>

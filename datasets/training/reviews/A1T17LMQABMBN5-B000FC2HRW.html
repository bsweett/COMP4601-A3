<meta name="summary" content="Fun guilty pleasure!"></head><body><p>Okay, let me say that whoever watches this film and is shocked that it isn't well written or well acted... You are not getting Citizen Kane here folks!  You get what you're being offered, and this is a teen slasher flick.  They are my guilty pleasure, and I enjoyed watching the first two movies and had a blast with this one as well.  This is a good standalone from the first two flicks, which means that you can watch it even if you hadn't given the first two a whirl (though I recommend that you do).  For those who watched Final Destination 1 and 2 are familiar with the plot: kids are headed for a ride (plane, car, this time a rollercoaster), one of them gets a premonition and he/she, along with several others, gets out just in time.  But then the ones who got off their bloody fates begin to die in mysterious and graphic ways in the order in which they would have died in the premonition.  It is up to the protagonist to stop the deaths, or at least try to save herself/himself before it's his or her turn.<br /><br />The third part of the trilogy features high school seniors about to graduate.  Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) gets signs and a clear as day premonition of what would happen if she gets on the rather sinister-looking rollercoaster.  Well, everything else is pretty predictable, for the plot doesn't change from the first two films.  The actors are all young and attractive.  They're not the best actors in the world, but I haven't seen very many horror flicks with Oscar-caliber performances.  The fun of this film is watching how the characters die.  There is a lot of decapitations in this one, that's for sure!  They are less creative or surprising than in the first two Final Destinations, but, as said earlier, you already pretty much know what to expect.  The thing I like about this one is that Wendy (Winstead) looks genuinely distressed and spooked during the death scenes.  Also, the screen writer, editor and director are smart enough to let time pass in between deaths so that the characters adjust to what they had seen and experienced.  I hated the detached way in which the characters in the earlier movies reacted when someone died right in front of them, as if to say, "Eeww, gross!  Okay, who's next?"  So unrealistic!  Speaking of unrealistic, why does the protagonist get a premonition if he/she and the others are meant to die that day?  Did they possess these powers BEFORE the horrible occurrence?  Is the Grim Reaper a sadist who wants to play a game of cat and mouse?  Total suspension of disbelief, like in all of these flicks, is necessary.  Then again, this is a teen horror flick.  Since when do these movies make sense?  I mean, Jason from Friday the 13th died when he was a kid, and then he reemerges a grown man with a hockey mask and an insatiable bloodlust. So... just watch and enjoy! (Okay, I could have done without the gratuitous topless scene at the tanning salon, but I bet the men loved THAT!)<br /><br />The DVD is good.  The widescreen edition (2:35 format) is better than the previous films, which had a 1:85 format.  I also liked the features.  The choose the fates and deaths thing is a good addition for die-hard fans.  I would recommend buying the set that includes all three movies if you don't already have them.  They are more of a bargain when bought together.  Plus you'll get to have a good time with your friends -- watching three movies while admitting that you actually enjoy this kind of stuff. Recommended for fun and entertainment.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Terrific visually but often boring as a box of Quaker oats!"></head><body><p>Here we have a wonderfully produced semi-epic film, with sprawling scenes... film art at its best; however, it really drags in terms of action.<br /><br />In a more positive defense of the film, if you are really into historically-based movies, I think you'll enjoy this one a great deal. But like similar productions such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007G1WH">Becket</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RF7XYY">Anne of the Thousand Days / Mary, Queen of Scots</a>, in an effort to accurately convey the tale the details here prey heavily upon the final achievement.<br /><br />The Story: It's all about the reign of Elizabeth I (1533-1603), daughter of Henry [Tudor] VIII and one of England's most renowned and controversial queens. There's a particular focus on Elizabeth's troubles with both Spain and with the large Catholic population of her country. (Henry VIII had been excommunicated by Pope Clement VII. The King had married the sensual Anne Boleyn, [mother of Elizabeth I] absent the Pope's approval of an annulment from his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, and then Henry subsequently established the Protestant Church of England.) The story also involves Elizabeth's rocky relationship with her Catholic cousin and rival for the British throne, Mary Queen of Scots who was ultimately executed by a malevolent Elizabeth.<br /><br />I feel additionally compelled to remark that the casting for this movie was near-perfect as were the indoor sets and outdoor locations. For this specific reason, I would especially recommend that you view the movie in its widescreen version on the biggest widescreen television you can find.<br /><br />In summary, if history is your thing, you'll likely award this 1 hour and 55 minute film four or five stars. If not, you'll probably be bored to tears.<br /><br />TIP: Many public libraries carry this DVD to loan out free-of-charge... you might consider borrowing it and afterward purchasing it if it turns out that you enjoyed the film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Stylish and highly stylized"></head><body><p>As a major fan of Robert Rodriguez and a fan of Frank Miller, I think that I was expecting a bit more from Sin City. It's hard to know exactly WHAT I wanted more of, since the film is suffused with style and violence, cheap broads with hearts of gold and mugs who never got a fair shot.<br /><br />But for all the style the film oozes, its extremely stylized dialogue is sometimes hard for the film's cast to get out and sound plausible doing so -- this is particularly true of some of the lines placed in the mouths of the actresses.<br /><br />Still, the film is ruthlessly true to Miller's vision and is easily the most hard-boiled noir movie ever made. As a result, Sin City has to be strongly recommended to fans of either.</p></body></html>

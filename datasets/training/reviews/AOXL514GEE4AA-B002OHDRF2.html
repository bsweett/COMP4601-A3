This is a fine addition to the Terminator storyline. Set in the future after "Judgment Day" it follows John Connor leading the resistance. The movie is well written and well acted (Worthington has serious potential) and throws you the occassional curveball to keep you interested. The action is well done and cgi compliments it! A must see for anyone who is a fan of the franchise. If this is your first exposure to it, you will find yourself looking for the other three movies a.s.a.p.<br /><br />MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: A beautiful print with some eye popping sequences. Demo Disc potential. FINAL VERDICT: A MUST OWN.</p></body></html>

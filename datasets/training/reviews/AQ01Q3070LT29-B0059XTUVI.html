<meta name="summary" content="Meryl Streep as former Prime Minister "Margaret Thatcher"."></head><body><p>Released December 30, 2011. Widescreen. Running Time: 1 hour, 44 mins.<br />  The movie begins with Margaret Thatcher (Meryl Streep), in her life of retirement, is purchasing a pint of milk in a market and is surprised by the price of it. At home, she speaks with her husband Denis (Jim Broadbent) during breakfast, however, her husband passed away in 2003. She misses her husband so much, it gives her comfort to believe he is still there in her home. It's a way of trying to keep memories. The staff sees her talking to herself.<br /> That night, she dresses up beautiful and entertains guests for dinner keeping up her character and staying in good spirits.<br />  Her daughter reminds her at bedtime that she is no longer the Prime Minister, Mark is in South Africa and her husband is dead. Margaret responds to her daughter, "You look exhausted, dear".<br /><br />  Margaret Thatcher was the longest serving Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (1979-90) of 11 years and 209 days and the first female Prime Minister.<br /><br /> I thought the movie was a bit disrespectful to Margaret Thatcher and I did not like the storyline jumping back and forth to the present and the past so much.<br /><br /> Meryl Streep won the Academy Award for Best Performance by an Actress. Best Achievement in Make-Up given to Mark Coulier and J. Roy Helland.<br /> BAFTA Award to Meryl Streep and Best Make-Up and Hair to J. Roy Helland, Marese Langan, Mark Coulier.<br /><br /> Movie is in English. Option of subtitles in English and Spanish.<br /><br /> Special Features: 6 featurettes.<br /><br /> If you see the James Bond movie, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AQMBIC">For Your Eyes Only [Blu-ray</a>], you will see Janet Brown convincingly play "Margaret Thatcher" and John Wells as "Denis Thatcher".<br /> Janet Brown died May 27, 2011 at the age of 87.<br /><br /> Baroness Margaret Thatcher is still alive at the age of 87.</p></body></html>

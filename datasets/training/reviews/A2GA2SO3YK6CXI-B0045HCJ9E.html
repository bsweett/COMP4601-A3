<meta name="summary" content="Cary Grant at his best!"></head><body><p>This is by far one of Cary Grant's best films. We now own the collection of most Alfred Hitchcock movies and actually play a game while watching them, for invariably he appears during his films. We watch and see who can spot his cameo appearances... my favorite is when Mr. Hitchcock is part of a portrait... so we had a devil of a time finding him during the movie.<br /><br />North by Northwest was produced in 1959 and it has a recipe of romance, intrigue, thrilling action, and mystery that produces a brilliant performance by Cary Grant.<br /><br />Cary Grant plays Roger O. Thornhill, an advertising executive who is erroneously kidnapped by enemies of a certain George Kaplan, supposedly a United States undercover agent. Mr. Thornhill is drugged but escapes and a fascinating series of events start to shape the plot. During this film, we see the appearance of great actors from Mission Impossible, the Man from Uncle, and other shows, which keep us at the edge of our seat with their mystery, thrilling action, and romance.<br /><br />Eva Marie Saint plays the part of the woman Cary Grant falls for. She is sexy, elegant, poised... and the two engage in some of the most interesting dialogue, which at some point, culminates in the most interesting of romantic kisses ever produced by Hollywood.<br /><br />The filming in New York City allows the audience to travel through Manhattan in the 50's and it is amazing how it all remains the same, and yet due to security... it is all so very different, especially with regards to visiting the United Nations, where there is a stabbing not to be missed for it is something that could not take place in today's terms.<br /><br />The end of the movie is a classic cliffhanger that takes place atop the stone faces of Mount Rushmore! Do not miss this movie! Cary Grant at his best!</p></body></html>

To me, it's just another typical gothic Tim Burton movie. Of course, no Tim Burton movie can be complete without Johhny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and Danny Elfman music. This was like 'The Wizard of Oz' tripping on acid. 19-year-old Alice is forced to marry, so she runs away and falls down a rabbit hole, into Wonderland. She must team up with the Mad Hatter and try to stop the evil Red Queen. I'd probably recommend ALICE IN WONDERLAND!!!</p></body></html>

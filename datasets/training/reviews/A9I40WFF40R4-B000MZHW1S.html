<meta name="summary" content="Out Of Africa"></head><body><p>The critics are touting "Blood Diamond," directed by Edward Zwick, as one of the best films of 2006 as well as lavishing praise on Leonardo DiCaprio for his performance as Danny Archer, diamond smuggler. The movie is certainly worth seeing. DiCaprio gives his best performance to date-- at least that I have seen-- as he usually suffers from what I call the Hugh Grant Syndrome, never able to be totally successful at playing a grownup. The outrageously beautiful African countryside is in sharp contrast to the unending bloody slaughter that takes place in Sierra Leone as families are either destroyed or left in abject poverty.<br /><br />Although the plot is predictable, the film is ultimately saved by the fine acting. In addition to the performance of DiCaprio, Jennifer Connelly as Maddy Bowen, the journalist who makes a difference in Archer's life, is outstanding. Nevertheless, no one comes close to Djimon Hounsou as Solomon, the poor African who finds the pink diamond in the first place. His performance almost justifies paying the outrageous price these days of a first-run movie.</p></body></html>

Into the last good fight I'll ever know. Live<br />and die on this day. Live and die on this day." After a plane carrying<br />oil drillers crashes in a remote part of Alaska there are only a few<br />survivors. While trying to decide what to do they notice a large wolf<br />stalking them. After an attack Ottway (Neeson) takes charge and tries<br />to lead them to safety. They just wonder what will kill them first, the<br />cold or the wolf pack. Going in I wasn't all that excited about this,<br />but because of my job I watched it. After about a half hour I was<br />hooked and after an hour I was on the edge of my seat and didn't movie<br />until the movie ended. I have tried to stay away from the clich&eacute; movie<br />review lines, but this is best described as an exhilarating adventure<br />that grabs you and doesn't let go till the last frame. Going in I heard<br />that the ending was horrible and ruined the movie. After watching this<br />I am wondering what they were talking about. The ending was perfect and<br />made me like the movie even more. This is a must see movie for action<br />and thriller fans. I really enjoyed this. Overall, one of the best<br />movies of the year so far. I Highly recommend this one. I give it an<br />A-.</p></body></html>

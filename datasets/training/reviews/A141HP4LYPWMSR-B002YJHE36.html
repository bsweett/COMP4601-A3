<meta name="summary" content=""Faith Is A Gift I Have Yet To Receive" ~ Where Are The Angels And Demons?"></head><body><p>Released in 2009, 'Angels and Demons' is director Ron Howard's second cinematic installment chronicling the adventures of Harry Langdon (Tom Hanks), symbolist extraordinaire. As in the 'Da Vinci Code' the bad guy is once again ensconced within Vatican walls and protected by churchly robes akin to wolves in sheeps clothing. Do you think maybe Dan Brown has an axe to grind? Be that as it may a movie is modern storytelling and the important question is did you enjoy the tale?<br /><br />I found the film somewhat a disappointment. It was a case of alot of glitz but no substance. The production values are first rate with an accomplished cast to match and the central character Harry Langdon is more complex and fascinating than, dare I say it, Indiana Jones (did I just hear thunder from on high). Yet with that said I must also say that I never got caught up in the story. There was no emotional connection, no pounding heartbeat, no anticipation of what was going to happen next. In the final analysis I felt cheated and I'm still wondering where are the angels and demons mentioned in the title? If they had stayed with the European title, 'Illuminati' at least it would have been an honest reflection of what the film was about.</p></body></html>

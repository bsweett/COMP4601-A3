I just wish the would of cast Mark Ruffalo as the hulk in this movie it would of made it a little better, he does a great job as the Hulk in the Avengers. I am not saying Edward Norton did a bad job as the Hulk but it seemed to me after watching The Avengers, that Mark really played the part better, especially when he is Bruce, and everyone knows the Hulk is nothing if you don't have the right Bruce. Don't let that stop you from seeing this movie though. It is filled with alot of.action, and well worth a viewing. I have the DVD version, but want to badly upgrade to the blu ray version, because I have heard this is one of the best looking blu ray films from Phase one. So if you are looking to upgrade, based on what I have been told you should definitely do that.</p></body></html>

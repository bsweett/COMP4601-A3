I will openly admit here and now at the beginning of my review that my opinion is somewhat biased by the fact that I just love this mystico/spiritual, conspiracy type of material, so there was little doubt I was going to enjoy the movie no matter what. The subject matter alone earns this film an unqualified 3 Stars.<br /><br />With 288 reviews on-line to date there's no need for me to give a synopsis. I would however like to say that upon viewing the film I found myself quite pleased with the end result. Production values, cinematography, acting and script were first rate as all Ron Howard productions are. While the film may not have lived up to expectations placed on it by many, especially those who read the novel, I do think it has accomplished its goal and will generate a great deal of late night conversation and re-evaluation of personal paradigms and long held beliefs. That in itself makes this film a worthwhile watch.</p></body></html>

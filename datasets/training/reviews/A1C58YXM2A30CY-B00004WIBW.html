<meta name="summary" content="Don't Lose Your Head Over This Entry by Tim Burton!"></head><body><p>It's been ten years since this cool Johnny Depp film came to play and it's still as fun and as comedic as they come.<br /><br />Loosely based on the Washington Irving tale, Tim Burton wanted to make a story that woudl be a horror tale, great texture and capturing some 18th century wildness.<br /><br />Oddly, this story reminded me of Columbo, kind of like an 18th century Columbo.  Similar in a lot of ways with the conspiracy theories, the four Sleepy Hollow conspirators, and the fact that Icabod's scientific know-how falls prey to an actual horror, the headless horseman.<br /><br />The Danny Elfman score adds to the mystery of the horseman.  Rated "R" most likely because of all the heads being lopped off, quite cleanly I might add.<br /><br />The detective mystery aspect is fascinating since I did not see that ending coming.  Christina Ricci plays a naive girl who dabbles in witchcraft and Icabod faints at the sight of spiders and corpses.<br /><br />Great flick for a Halloween night.<br /><br />The DVD has some cool extras, such as an interview with the cast and crew and you really get into Burton's head and see what he was all about, plus film trailers and such.<br /><br />Uncredited appearance by Martin Landau in the beginning of the film, and a short but masterful rendition of a court judge by Christopher Lee.<br /><br />To add, the photography was the best.  The deep, muted colors throughout the film gave it a moody, depressing look.  After the evil is banished at the end, all is bright and autumn red colors.  Yeah, a bit corny but interesting play of color and light.<br /><br />Other Burton Films Recommended:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P0J074">Beetlejuice</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VDDWDI">Edward Scissorhands [Blu-ray</a>]</p></body></html>

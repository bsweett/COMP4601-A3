<meta name="summary" content="Not as good as the Japanese original but watchable"></head><body><p>Having watched the Japanese original a few years before this remake, I hoped this would fare better. Unfortunately, it does not. The original version is much better on all levels, be it acting, atmosphere, and pure terror. This remake is not very scary, but it is interesting to watch, just don't expect chills and scares at every turn. Jennifer Connelly [A Beautiful Mind] makes a beautiful if tragic character, playing the role of a recently divorced woman, Dahlia who leases an apartment in a dingy complex on New York's Roosevelt Island. She is in the midst of a heated custody battle over her five-year-old daughter, Cecilia and things only get worse when she finds the new apartment is anything but perfect. Now, having watched Ms Connelly in House of Sand of Fog, she does a similarly admirable job of portraying an emotionally conflicted character here too. There are some good supporting roles here, e.g. Tim Roth as Dahlia's attorney, and also John C Reilly as the loathsome apartment manager. On the whole, this movie would have been a much better horror story as it purports to be if it had focussed more on explaining the supernatural occurences in the movie than on merely dwelling on the tormented character of Dahlia. But, it is definitely a watchable movie despite its flaws, for it does a credible job of exploring the psychology of complex human emotions & relationships.</p></body></html>

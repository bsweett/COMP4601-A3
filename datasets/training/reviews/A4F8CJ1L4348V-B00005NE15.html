Probably because it was more updated than this one. Also, in this version it is like they took the thriller affect only so far. They did not tip it over the top like they did in the remake. I did like this version as well though. It was very scarey in it't time and also this is a very well known movie. All in all, it was a very fun movie to watch on a cold winter's night. I do recommend this movie to all of the "horror classic fans".</p></body></html>

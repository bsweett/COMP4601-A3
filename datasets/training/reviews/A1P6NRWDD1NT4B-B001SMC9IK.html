<meta name="summary" content="At Least They Didn't Get Will Smith to Play Klaatu"></head><body><p>THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL reimaged or remade is pretty much an effects-driven film with stereotypes, whereas the original film was a character-driven story with a plot. Granted, this new film has an ecological agenda compared to the anti-nuclear war theme of the old film. However, it still didn't bring anything new to the sci-fi genre. It felt rehashed and cliched. One of the highlights of the original film is the relationship between Klaatu/Mr. Carpenter & Bobby (Michael Rennie & Billy Gray respectively). In this film, the relationship is strained. Jayden Smith's character ("Jacob" instead of "Bobby") was trite and annoying. In the original, Michael Rennie's Klaatu/Mr. Carpenter (a Christ-like analogy) was humane and compassionate, but Keanu Reeve's Klaatu ( the "Mr. Carpenter" alias is not used in the film) is a typical cold "take-me-to-your-leader" comicbook alien. The rest of the cast from Jennifer Connelly, Kathy Bates, Jon Hamm, & Kyle Chandler all play typical "scientists", "government officials", and military types". The surprise here is John Cleese as Professor Karl Barnhardt (Sam Jaffe in the original) who plays it straight and dramatic instead of comedic, adding some integrity to the story. However, his part is short-lived and pretty much a homage than an integral part to the story. Lastly, the Gort/robot character is completely wasted and not fully explained (and the classic line "Gort, Klaatu barada nikto" isn't used to operate him either). Instead, a mass of alien locusts is unleased to destroy mankind (They went from a Christ analogy to a Moses analogy...go figure?). There are some good sci-fi special effects moments here, but ultimately the execution fails (especially the vague ending). This new film makes a somewhat nice companion piece (not a replacement) because it is only good to compare it to Robert Wise's original classic film and realise how inferior it is to the original despite the modern special effects.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Just your average everday conspiracy thriller"></head><body><p>The Interpreter is nothing to write home about. Sydney Pollack's thriller suffers from a bit of an identity crisis - does it want to be a Hitchcock suspenser, conspiracy thriller, character piece, morality play or poltical drama? To which the answer is, probably. Throwing away its Hitchcockian premise, it wears the conspiracy clothes most comfortably, but the plot is easily guessed thanks to two massively unsubtle hints and, aside from a good sequence on a bus, builds up to what would be a serious anticlimax if the rest of the film were any better. Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn, the latter looking like a bizarre deflated hybrid of Walter Matthau, Dustin Hoffman and Pollack himself here, do ok by their cliched parts and the casting of Earl Cameron, one time elder statesman of British race-relations pictures like Sapphire and Flame in the Streets, as the Mugabe-like liberator-turned-dictator is clever. It's watchable in a once-only way, but it's a long way from the quality of Three Days of the Condor. Next time, guys, finish the script before starting shooting.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="IMAX in 3D was the best thing...you won't get on DVD"></head><body><p>I was really psyched about seeing PROMETHEUS and it was a big visual feast in an IMAX theatre with 3D glasses...but, afterward, thinking about the story...this movie was a wreck.<br /><br />There's a hilarious youtube video where one guy rants about all the things that don't add up in the film (and he's right).  I can't link it here, but it's really funny.  Some guy on a couch sitting next to another guy sitting mutely.<br /><br />Basically, scientists assemble cave drawings that point to an outer space connection to life on earth.  The aliens who probably started mankind, as well as life on earth, are called the Engineers and the scientists head into deep space to find them.  Good start.  Man searching for his origins.<br /><br />But then the story begins to fall apart.  And the scientists appear to be the dumbest people on this mission.  The usual corrupt elements who want to screw over the hapless humans on the mission to get alien specimens jump the gun for some reason and turn the crew into their little experiment...a long, long way from home...and threatening to cut off their way home...wait...WHAT'S GOING ON IN THIS MOVIE?  Knowing this film is somehow tenuously connected to ALIEN is like waiting for another better movie to barge into the movie you're watching.  And then it happens.  And you have no idea what's going on.<br /><br />But, hey, it looked awesome on the big screen in 3D.</p></body></html>

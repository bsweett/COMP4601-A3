<meta name="summary" content="Third Time Out For This Fractured Fairy Tale Doesn't Quite Have The Charm"></head><body><p>I'll say right out that the original SHREK is one of my favorite animated films of all time and though my memory of the second film is a little dim I know I enjoyed it too. SHREK THE THIRD carries on the good hearted fractured fairy tale themes of its predecessors but the misunderstood ogre gimmick is beginning to wear a bit thin.  Shrek and Fiona still make a sweet couple and Puss (Antonio Bandaras) and Donkey (Eddie Murphy) continue to play their parts as amusing sidekicks well.  The scenes at the medieval high school where Shrek and Company pick up the future King Arthur (Justin Timberlake) who is a bit of a teenage dweeb are quite amusing.  However some of the scenes such as at the villain tavern just seem so "busy" with ideas and characters that the viewer can't absorb it all.  I also didn't care for Fiona's fairy tale princess friends who get imprisoned and then escape with her and her mom (Julie Andrews) back in Far Far Away.  I did like the pop songs used on the soundtrack and the animation is stunning from beginning to end.  As in the other SHREK films there is an important message that all should believe in  themselves though young viewers might be a bit confused by Shrek's fear of becoming a father which is happily resolved by the film's ending.  SHREK THE THIRD is not a bad film but I hope Dreamworks is satisfied at leaving the series as a trilogy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A night at the bay that'll have you running for inland!"></head><body><p>Being yet another movie that comes from The Golden Era of Horror Films, "The Fog" contains all the elements that make up a classic horror movie. It's got a great and chilling atmosphere with the mysterious fog that rolls in and out, a really cool setting with the city on the bay, great monsters that are in this case, the ghosts of the sailors, and there's even some good gore shots throughout.<br /><br />Although the pace of this movie is not the fastest in a horror film, I think it's suitable to the overall atmosphere of the movie, which for the most part, is dark and surreal, the sort of tone that's set on a movie you'd watch on a stormy Friday night. By the time the movie climaxes at the end, you'll definitely feel the impact and the wait will indeed be worth it. The ending, however, is the most likely part of the movie that will be the most debatable among horror fans. I personally felt that, for the most part, it was satisfying, although it the tone of the ending was a little awkward, almost as though the writers were preparing a sequel.<br /><br />With all said and done, "The Fog" is a classic, atmospheric horror movie and is highly recommended to fans seeking such a film. An ideal movie for Halloween time, be sure to pick it up in time for the 31st! Thanks for the time, and peace.</p></body></html>

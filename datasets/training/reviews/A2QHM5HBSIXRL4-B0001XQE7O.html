<meta name="summary" content="I never bought into "McGregor becomes Finney""></head><body><p>A good film, but the key part of 'Big Fish' rests in your belief that young Ed Bloom (as portrayed by Ewan McGregor) can become old Ed Bloom (Albert Finney).<br /><br />No way.<br /><br />I never for a second bought into that, and instead spent the entire time thinking about what a absurd leap of faith that required.  By contrast, Alison Lohman becoming Jessica Lange was a lot more believable...unfortunately, that connection is not as tantamount to the core story.<br /><br />Do you want to see a movie where the young-to-old transition works at a fascinating level?  Check out the 2001 release "Iris" where young John Bayley - as played by Hugh Bonneville - morphs into the eldery version played by Jim Broadbent.  You would *swear* this was the same actor playing both roles.  And, equally impressive, we get two very famous actresses - Kate Winslet and Judi Dench - playing young and old Iris Murdoch respectively to great effect and a semaless transition.  That's the gold standard for this technique in my mind.  'Big Fish' comes up short.</p></body></html>

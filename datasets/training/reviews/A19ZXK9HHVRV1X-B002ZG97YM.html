It's not that Hiccup doesn't WANT to be a dragon-slayer; heck, he's even enrolled in a dragon-slaying course replete with real dragons for the students to practice their moves on.  No, the problem is that Hiccup has met and made friends with an injured dragon in the wild (a beast he calls Toothless) and the lad soon discovers that dragons are not the natural-born enemies to Man that he and the other Vikings thought they were.<br /><br />Beyond its glorious visuals, eye-popping action sequences, and terrific voiceover work, "How to Train Your Dragon," written and directed by Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, emerges as a surprisingly compelling human tale of a boy who wants desperately to live up to the high standards his demanding father has set for him, but who just can't betray his new-found best friend in order to do so.  Without getting sappy about it, the movie provides fine moral lessons for the youngsters - though, one should point out that the intensity of the action scenes may prove a tad disturbing for the very littlest in the audience.  Its soaring flight scenes are some of the best we've ever encountered in an animated movie, and its canny combination of humor, adventure and sentiment catapult it to the head of the class among recent animated films (along with "Toy Story 3," that is).</p></body></html>

Set in Los Angeles in the early 1950s, "Confidential" deals with an incredible case of police corruption which is unearthed little by little as the dead bodies pile up.  There are so many terrific performances in this movie (Kevin Spacey as the jaded vice cop, Russell Crowe as the Rambo wannabe, Guy Pearce as the straight-arrow lieutenant, James Cromwell as the venal police captain, and Kim Basinger as the call girl with a heart) that they would have had to hand out Oscars by the bucketful to do justice to everyone who deserved one.  Of the minor characters, my favorite was Danny DeVito as the sleazeball sleaze magazine editor, whose talent for telling all finally does him in.  There are a few real-life characters being played in this film; who in the baby-boomer set doesn't remember Johnny Stompanato, the small-time thug and sometime paramour of Lana Turner who was murdered by her daughter, which was ultimately dismissed as justifiable homicide?  The main characters in the film are so compelling as to be totally mesmerizing.  Lieutenant Exley, played by Guy Pearce, tries earnestly to steer a straight path through the miasma of corruption running rampant in his precinct, even as he boosts his own career through rampant self-promotion.  Kevin Spacey is great as Seargeant Jack Vincennes, who is mired so deep in the vice squad that he is becoming as jaded and venal as the human slimeballs he mixes with, until he stumbles onto the key players of the corruption within the LAPD, and James Cromwell practically oozes evil as the loathesome Captain Dudley Smith.  But the film really belongs to Russell Crowe and his portrayal of Officer Bud White; with his take-no-prisoners mentality, he seems to represent everything that is wrong with the LAPD (vicious, corrupt, violent, insensitive); but with White there is a limit, and when he stumbles into the rot in his department, his better instincts take over.  There is blood and gore galore in this film but the story is so well told that none of the violence is gratuitous.  It's a story of people doing a mean, dirty job with honor or dishonor.  This movie defines film noir as it has never been defined before, and it ranks as one of the greatest films of the past decade.  The acting, directing and production can only be described in superlatives.  It's a winner on all counts.</p></body></html>

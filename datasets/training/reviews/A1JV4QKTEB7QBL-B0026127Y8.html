<meta name="summary" content="Jason Bourne Again"></head><body><p>Whoa!  "Taken" written by Luc Besson and directed by Pierre Morel moves quickly through its 94 minutes with the assuredness of a film that makes no claim to be anything than what it is--pure adrenaline producing action that entertains.<br /><br />Don't expect any hidden political agendas or veiled messages about the state of the world.  Don't analyze each and every segment thinking that every "i" will be dotted and every "t" crossed.  Just sit back, buckle an imaginary seatbelt and prepare yourself for a wild ride driven by the pathos of a loving father whose winsomely innocent daughter finds herself at the mercy of the big bad world.<br /><br />"Taken," starring the ever-endearing Liam Neeson as an ex-CIA operative whose one-track mind seems rooted in the desire of seeing Kim, his gangly, albeit charmingly so, seventeen year old daughter maturing happily and comfortably under his meticulous auspices despite the fact that she lives apart from him with her rather angry mother (Famke Janssen) and rich stepfather, shoves the nasty demimonde of crime organized to feed the exploitive tastes of rich degenerates in our faces.  As horrific as all this is, the quick pace of the story, forces us to react as quickly as Neeson does as he forges along through his once familiar stomping ground foiling the plans of an Albanian gang intent on human trafficking when they snatch the virginal Kim during a vacation in Paris.<br /><br />Neeson takes no prisoners.  He is a one-man killing machine.  Ludicrously, the bullets fly, the fists slam into faces and kidneys with the same lethal accuracy displayed by celluloid hero, Jason Bourne played by Matt Damon but without Bourne's robotic nonchalance.  Papa Neeson's face bleeds with anguish raw enough for the audience to warily sense like some automatic hormonal discharge that one can smell and taste and rawer still to barely interpret as something so distressful, lingering on it for too many seconds would shatter the rationale to a point of being unable to function.  Neeson conveys this reaching of his emotional limit and his need to turn away from dwelling on it to perfection.  As he stumbles through a tented makeshift whorehouse on a construction site, pulling back curtain after curtain revealing one stoned and under-aged girl after another, we see the pain in his eyes.  The images flash with such feral brutality and stark intensity that we know he must push them from his mind to achieve the goal of finding his girl. Neeson works this part with such emotional nuance, that when he flattens each of his adversaries, there is no question in the audience's mind on how he did it.  We simply believe it.<br /><br />Bottom line?  "Taken" follows the Bourne trilogy school of rapid-fire action cinema.  Its fun, escapist fare and Liam Neeson hones his part like a master craftsman as a concerned papa looking out for his only daughter.  Some grisly scenes of torture, adult themes of sexual slavery and stereotypical Eastern European and Middle Eastern bullies abound. Nevertheless, recommended.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />"reneofc"</p></body></html>

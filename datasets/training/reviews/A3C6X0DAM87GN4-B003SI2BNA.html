But those expecting a thought provoking, intelligent, psychological thriller may very well be pleased.<br /><br /> Jennifer Connelly stars as Dahlia, a woman who is going through a messy divorce with Kyle (Dougray Scott) who keeps calling his wife crazy, and we wonder why these two are breaking up. It seems Dahlia did in fact have an unstable childhood due mostly to her mother abandoning her. And forget about the father, he's never seen or talked about.<br /><br /> But Dahlia's childhood is starting her mirror her daughter's, Ceci (Ariel Gade). Dahlia does not want Ceci to feel that she or her father will abandon her.<br /><br /> In an attempt to find a cheap apartment in New York (good luck) she finds one in Roosevelt Island, and as her daughter aptly points out, "that's not the city mommy". Children are becoming so smart nowadays, it must be the internet.<br /><br /> As soon as we see the apartment our first instinct is to run, but Dahlia has to find a place to live and get a job so she will seem capable of taking care of her daughter. Mr. Murray (John C. Reilly) does his best to convince Dahlia that with a new coat of paint the place will look fantastic. And then there's that black hole on the wall that he decides not to talk about. But, oh well, its probably nothing, right?<br /><br /> "Dark Water" is the best Japanese horror remake I have seen. I don't find Japanese horror films scary. I find them dull and boring. I think the structure of the film's are confusing. The characters underdevolped. I didn't get a kick out of either "Ring" movie nor did I enjoy the film "Ju-On". I did however think the American remake "The Grudge" did a good job of making sense of that series. But "Dark Water" is more about the people than the cheap thrills. Director Walter Salles ("Central Station", "The Motorcyle Diaries") surprisingly turns out to be a good choice for directing this type of movie. Like all of the films I've seen from him this one has an appealing look. The colors in the film perfectly match the mood of the movie.<br /><br /> And then there's Connelly's performance. She is turing into one of the best actresses we have. I enjoyed her in "House of Sand & Fog", it was one of my favorite movies of 2003. I was glad to see her win an Oscar for "A Beautiful Mind" and I'm glad to see her in this film as well. Connelly is able to make us care about her characater. She brings out all the inner demons going on, or are they real?<br /><br /> But "Dark Water" does take a few misteps. The movie's conclusion I thought was too abrupt. We were expecting more of a struggle. It builds up a great amount of tension and then very gently drops it all. Though in the end "Dark Water" turns into a tender, heartwarming story. It is really a story about a mother's love.<br /><br /> Bottom-line: Director Walter Salles and Jennifer Connelly takes the recent tend in American remakes of Japanese horror films to a new level. The movie is not about scares and sounds that go bump in the night, but instead is about people.</p></body></html>

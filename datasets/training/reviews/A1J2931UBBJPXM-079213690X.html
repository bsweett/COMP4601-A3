Man has fought on one battlefield or another and in one arena after another in an effort to rid himself of the shackles that bind him, and he has always paid a dear price for that freedom.  "Braveheart," directed by and starring Mel Gibson, is the story of one man who would not abide the despotic rule of an unworthy sovereign, and took a stand against it.  A 13th Century commoner and a patriot who loved his country, Scotland, William Wallace (Gibson) burned with an unquenchable desire to be free of the British, who had murdered his father when William was just a boy.  Raised by kin, Wallace nevertheless grew up wanting only to marry, work his farm and raise a family.  But circumstances dictated otherwise, and without knowing what they had unleashed, the British rekindled that fire that burned within the boy, and Wallace soon left his mark on the Monarchy of King Edward I of England.<p> Wallace was a man of singular determination, and managed to do what no one else had ever been able to do before him:  He united the clans of Scotland.  Before Wallace, the clans stubbornly clung to their autonomy, changed loyalties whenever the mood struck them or the price was right, and endured the domination of the British because of it.  Wallace changed all that, by convincing them that by standing together as one, they could win.  And he proved it.  He amassed an army and made a stand at York, and again on the battlefields of Stirling and Falkirk.  With savage tenacity and courage, he never gave in nor gave up his relentless and heroic quest to make Scotland free.  <p> Gibson brings Wallace to life with a performance worthy of the man he portrays.  To achieve what he did, Wallace had to be larger than life, and that's exactly what Gibson brings to the screen.  But he plays him as a man, not a hero; Gibson's Wallace is very real, and someone you can believe would be able to stand before an army and lead them into battle.  In one memorable scene Wallace, mounted on a spirited horse, addresses his men-- many of whom had just joined him-- as they are about to engage the enemy at Stirling.  Someone from amongst the crowd calls out, "We heard Wallace is seven feet tall!"  To which Wallace replies, "I AM William Wallace!"  And by the time he finishes his powerful speech (which screenwriter Randall Wallace openly confesses was liberally borrowed from Shakespeare's "Henry V"), spurring them on and preparing them for the impending battle, you believe he IS seven feet tall.  It's an inspired performance through which Gibson shows you the man behind the legend, while at the same time he makes you understand just how and why the legend was born.  <p> And, as impressive as Gibson is in front of the camera, what he does behind the camera with this film is even more impressive.  The magnitude of this film is awe inspiring, and that Gibson could carry it as an actor, while directing it as well, is quite a feat, indeed.  He used the bleak weather of Scotland and Ireland to great advantage in scene after scene, creating the perfect atmosphere in which to tell his story; he experimented with different camera speeds, especially when filming Catherine McCormack (Murron), which gave her a more graceful, sensuous look; he staged some of the most compelling battle sequences ever made; and he captured the intricacies of the characters-- all with an eye for detail and the ability to integrate it all into a film that took home the Oscar for Best Picture, while deservedly landing him the Award for Best Director.  It was obviously a labor of love for Gibson, but the hard work paid off handsomely in the end, especially for the audience, for it is they who realize the real fruits of this endeavor-- a truly stirring and memorable motion picture.<p> The supporting cast includes Patrick McGoohan (Longshanks), Sophie Marceau (Isabelle), Angus MacFadyen (Robert the Bruce), Brendan Gleeson (Hamish) and Peter Hanly (Prince Edward).  A film of epic proportions, "Braveheart" is emotionally involving and inspiring, with a message about the irrepressible capacity of the human spirit.  Gibson put everything he had into this one, and it shows; this is his "Citizen Kane," a pinnacle of achievement that few actor/directors every attain.  With brilliant cinematography (by John Toll), some of the finest editing you'll ever see (by Steven Rosenblum), terrific performances and Gibson's special touch, this is an unforgettable film that demonstrates what the magic of the movies is really all about.  If you love movies, this is one you simply do not want to miss.</p></body></html>

Generally the only methods a moviegoer has for choosing to see a specific movie is the trailer he or she watches on TV, in theaters, or over the internet. If for some reason a person doesn't see the trailer, the other marketing method used to get a moviegoer's attention would be the movie poster with a striking image and catchphrase that sums up the movie with one or two lines of copy. Regardless of what method ends up grabbing the individual's attention, the studio should feel some need to make sure that they have properly marketed the movie to the appropriate audience to maximize the number of tickets sold in order to turn a profit. For some reason though, studios sometimes have a misfire when it comes to their marketing strategy for certain movies. Whether the cause is a misleading trailer or catchphrases on the poster that lead the audience astray, it doesn't matter, if the movie doesn't deliver upon the expectations set forth by the marketing material, the studio will generally find themselves with a flop on their hands. One such misfire would be the most recent directorial effort by acclaimed director William Friedkin ("The Exorcist"), called "Bug" starring Ashley Judd and Michael Shannon.<br /><br />"Bug" tells the story of a down-trodden, lonely waitress named Agnes, (Ashley Judd), who is barely scraping by as she attempts to hide from her ex-husband (Harry Connick, Jr.) while living in a rundown motel room. One day things begin to possibly look up for this lonely woman as she is introduced to a gulf war veteran, Peter, (Michael Shannon) who is interested in starting a relationship with her; however, this veteran is not without his share of issues. He believes that his time spent fighting for the United States has left him the subject of top-secret testing using bugs implanted beneath his skin. As his paranoia grows exponentially, Peter begins to drag Agnes into his dangerous delusions until she becomes fully immersed in his disturbed version of reality.<br /><br />The marketing campaign for this film, meaning the previews and the movie posters, led me and many other moviegoers to believe that this would be a horror film in the vein of "The Fly" or something similar. The catchphrases used in conjunction with this movie were ones along the lines of, `the most disturbing horror film ever made' or `the scariest movie of the year', further convincing me that this would definitely be one scary movie to see and one that would most likely not disappoint. Plus, with the added bonus of solid actors filling the roles and an acclaimed director at the helm, how could this movie possibly go wrong. Well, somehow it found a way, and let me tell you I was extremely let down.<br /><br />"Bug" is anything but a scary movie, there isn't a single moment in the entire film that could even be deemed as scary. No jump scenes, no blood or gore (a staple for today's modern horror films), or monsters/killers to fear, all this movie had was a lonely woman and a very strange man as the focus. If anything the movie was a little creepy at times, but even that wasn't too extreme. The movie was definitely not one I would consider a horror film, I would place it more in the category of psychological thriller, though using the word thriller is a bit of a stretch, the movie isn't all that thrilling and it's certainly not exciting. It strives to be one of those slow-boiling types of films where the audience senses the impending disaster that is approaching in the lives of the characters, but in the end the film doesn't deliver, and the audience is left disappointed and wishing for something more from the movie.<br /><br />Where the movie did succeed was in the actors' performances and straight-forward, nothing flashy, style of direction from William Friedkin. Friedkin made every scene feel very personable, as if you were in the room with the actors at all times, a very effective method in a movie like this, but not enough to save it. Every one of the three main actors delivered very strong, convincing performances that one would expect from such talent. But their capable acting ability was not enough to save this movie from becoming the flop it turned out to be.<br /><br />It is sad to think that a director like William Friedkin wasn't smart enough or powerful enough to steer this movie into the proper genre it belonged in; or at least assist in making the marketing applicable to the type of film it ended up as. Take it from me don't pay attention to the enticing previews or clever catchphrases for this movie; if you do you will be left severely disappointed by the results.<br /><br />"Bug" is rated R for brief violence, drug use, language, and nudity/sexuality.</p></body></html>

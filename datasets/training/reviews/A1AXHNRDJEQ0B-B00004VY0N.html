Little signs of bad luck appeared here and there - the unlucky number 13, which was not only included in the spaceship's name but in some time points of their crucial events, an astronaut being bumped off the flight because he might have caught the measles, and the commander's wife losing her ring the morning before the launch. But nothing major, and definitely nothing scientific... Even their broadcast from space was not aired - not interesting enough, probably...<p>Up until a few minutes after the broadcast, that is - when a routine operation on the oxygen tanks caused a loud bang - and pretty soon not only the landing on the moon was cancelled, but also the landing back home seemed in geopardy. Thruogh the heroic efforts of the crew - both on the spaceship, but mainly in mission control - and many not-too-standard improvisations, the space shuttle landed on earth.<p>The quality of picture and sound were great, and the extra material is excellent, especially the commntary of the real Jim Lovell and his wife...<p>Even though not all of the little detail were exact - Jack Swaiggert was a very competent pilot who even wrote the emergency procedures for the CM, and the crew were only worried about his ability to work the ship while they were not on it but on the LEM. Also, an interesting fact I've read in Jim Lovell's book is that using the LEM as a lifeboat is an idea that they got on one of the practice flights they had before the actual lift off... But nevertheless, this is still is a great reproduction of one of the most succesful failures ever...</p></body></html>

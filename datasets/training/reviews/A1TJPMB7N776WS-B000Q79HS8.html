<meta name="summary" content="The Night Has A Thousand Eyes"></head><body><p>Dark, crisply directed, smartly written and harkening back to the 1960's style of political thriller like "The Spy Who Came in from The Cold," "The Bourne Supremacy" is the perfect antidote to the bloated, zeppelin balloon-sized messes of "I, Robot" and "The Day After Tomorrow."<br /><br />And Matt Damon's performance as Jason Bourne has now deepened and matured and in the process has become irretrievably lost, mortally wounded, deeply touching and ultimately sad. His Bourne is a man without a family, without memories, without anything resembling a life. He has been manipulated and used and lives without any hope. Damon shows us all this without much more than a glance or a look of desperation emanating from his troubled eyes.<br /><br />Like "The Bourne Identity" before it, "The Bourne Supremacy" succeeds because of the filmmakers commitment to stylish and cogent story-telling and intelligent writing.  At  "Supremacy's" end and Bourne walks off towards the horizon it is all too obvious that his so called Supremacy can only be described as that of a man forever doomed to spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder, trusting no one and having nothing or no one to call his own.</p></body></html>

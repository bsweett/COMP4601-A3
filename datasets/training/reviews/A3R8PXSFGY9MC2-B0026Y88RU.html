<meta name="summary" content="Lucky Number Slevin"></head><body><p>As already noted Lucky Number Slevin is shot in a very stylised and slick way, which I happened to enjoy. The story keeps you engrossed as it moves at a good pace and all the actors do an OK job that shouldn't make you cringe too much. I liked it more than most films of 2006, and you can do worse for a bit of afternoon entertainment. The twist in the tale was good and it finished with a satisfying ending. Not bad overall, but not outstanding.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="First 70 minutes are hilarious, then................."></head><body><p>This movie was about 30-45 minutes too long. It's like I saw two different movies shoved together so they could succeed in getting a two hour comedy movie released. I am a firm believer in the fact that I don't mind if a comedy is short in the 70-85 minute range as long as it's funny, and this one was that movie, but it just kept going and going. So, let's talk about the first half of the movie, or the 4-star part....Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are professional wedding crashers, and they are extremely talented at it, they are sure to get every slightest detail down so no mistake can be made, and for a while everything is going fine, they are eating, drinking and freakin' everything in sight. All the while making us laugh....alot. The lies and the facial expressions these two come up with are just plain priceless. The chemistry between Vaughn and Wilson is perfect, as expected, what is this the 4th or 5th movie they've been in together?<br /><br />Eventually, Wilson falls in love, breaking 1 of the some thousand wedding crashing rules, and to top it off, the woman Wilson fell in love with (the lovely Rachel McAdams) is the daughter of Christopher Walken, who just happens to be running for office. To add more crazyness to the plot, Vaughn's character nails another one of the daughters, who in turn falls in love with him. Got all that? Good, moving on....The dialogue between Wilson and Vaughn is very funny, most of the jokes work, and while a bit raunchy here and there, it fits well. Now here's where things start to fall apart, both with the movie and our heroe's.<br /><br />The second part of the movie, or the 2-star part, goes all out on Hollywood cliches' We get the family bickering, the big 'fight' between Wilson and Vaughn, the speech during the wedding , it just seemed forced and that they just ran out of good jokes, so they recycled some old, lamer ones. I saw the ending coming a mile away and the edge and character the movie had is all but gone now.<br /><br />So, I gave 4-stars and 2-stars, another bit of the 4-star part I rather enjoyed are the minor roles played by Jane Seymour, she plays Christopher Walken's drunk wife with new breasts, and Will Ferrell (surprised? nah, me either, I think there is an agreement  with these 3 men along with Ben Stiller to appear in everyone of each other's movies. just a thought) as Chaz, the legendary wedding crasher Vaughn and Wilson are always quoting. He plays a man in his late 30's, still leaving with his mother, now crashing funerals cuz' it's so easy to get laid by a depressed chick, or so Ferrell says.<br /><br />There are many subplots, most I didn't care for, but be sure and check out Vaughn's confession to a preist at the breakfeast table........priceless!!! and Jane Seymour's half-ass attempt at seducing Owen Wilson with her new ta-ta's, very funny!!<br /><br />acting......4 stars, You know you can't go wrong with these two<br /><br />directing....3 stars, 30-54 minutes too long<br /><br />special effects...N/A, comedy here, not thrills and chills<br /><br />comedy rating .....4 stars first 70 minutes, 2 stars after that<br /><br />quality........3.5 stars, Decent picture quality, little grain, but great soundtrack</p></body></html>

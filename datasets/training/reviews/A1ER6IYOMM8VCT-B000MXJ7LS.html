<meta name="summary" content="WELL DONE!"></head><body><p>I was not a huge fan of United 93 as a movie. The subject matter is certainly valid, but I thought as a movie, the story was not told well and by the end of the movie I was mad and looking for revenge! World Trade Center on the other hand is also valid subject matter and a gripping inspirational movie! A fitting tribute to our public servants and to our country. This film was much better than I expected. The DVD transfer and extras are very good.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Nukes Can Be Funny Especially With Peter Sellers"></head><body><p>This movie is really the definitive dark comedy, there is nothing particulary funny about nukes or war for that matter, but this film does indeed make you laugh. Peter Sellers was one of the best comedic talents who ever lived. Dr. Strangelove displays his talents in one film just as well as the entire Pink Panther series did. Stanley Kubrick was a great director and this movie is one of his finest works. Highly recommended movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the best holiday movies ever"></head><body><p>Its funny and non-stop laughs.  I saw it when it came out in the movies last year and bought it the day it came out.  The deleted scenes are funny.  Zooey Deschanel is hot.  I think everyone should see it.  And as funny as Will Ferrel is and as he is funny in this and old school he is also funny in starsky and hutch and is funny in his worst movie anchorman which sucked.  His others are great!!!!  But not anchorman that just sucked.  Sucked a whole lot.</p></body></html>

Then, wandering through the halls, wondering where all the doctors and nurses have gone. Upon exiting the building, you see that the entire city appears vacant and in a shambles. What happened? Where did all the people go? This is how it is for the hero of Danny Boyle's jarring 28 DAYS LATER. London England has been swept clean of her inhabitants, at least those of the normal variety. What is left are roaming bands of bloodthirsty maniacs, driven insane by a virus that quickly decimated the population. The story is good, owing much to both Night and Dawn Of The Dead, The Crazies, The Omega Man, Last Man On Earth, and even The Day Of The Triffids. We follow the uninfected survivors as they attempt to make it to an oasis of sanity they've heard about on the radio. A place that promises sanctuary and salvation for our battle-weary adventurers. Will they make it? What, if anything will they find there? We get to join them in their quest, hoping that they make it before some infected nut gets a hold of them. 28DL, like Boyle's Trainspotting, offers us a ride that may not take us where we want to go. Where Trainspotting showed us the utter deadness of addiction, 28DL shows us survival in it's most raw form. Just watch what these people have to do to stay alive. Watch who they must kill. I highly recommend this movie. Belongs in every horror collection...</p></body></html>

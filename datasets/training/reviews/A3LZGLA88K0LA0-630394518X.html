<meta name="summary" content="THE HOUNDS OF SEVEN"></head><body><p>'Seven' is one of the most disturbing thrillers I've had the pleasure (or displeasure?) to watch.  It is a brilliant film, well directed, acted and photographed.  The ending is one of the most frightening and disturbing pieces of film-making in recent thriller history.  <p>When watching this film, though, take in some of the other amazing things:  the performance of the always-dependable Morgan Freeman.  Freeman has been overlooked numerous times by the Oscar folk, and sadly so.  He is outstanding in this role, and commands most of the movie away from his stellar cast-mates.<p>Look at the performance of Brad Pitt, the &quot;hunk&quot; who can really act, when given the opportunity to do so.  Relish in the superior acting of two future Oscar winners--Gwyneth Paltrow and the amazing Kevin Spacey.  Neither is given much screen time, but they both are incredible in their brief appearances.  Spacey is out and out terrifying as the serial killer.  Paltrow has a very beautiful scene with Freeman in which she laments her new life in the city.  This movie firmly convinces me that New York City is not the place for anyone in their right mind to live. Few directors have captured the seamy side of NYC as well as David Flincher.<p>This is a stunning film, and ranks up there with the best of the genre.</p></body></html>

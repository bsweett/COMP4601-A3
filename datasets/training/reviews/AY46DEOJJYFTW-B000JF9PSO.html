This is exquisite filmaking about the toughest day in our history for many Americans. Shot in documentary style with no star power but solid acting all around. Paul Greengrass respectfully chronicles the last flight of United 93 as passengers and crew arrive and terroists prep themselves for their mission. Knowing what will happen and watching the events unfold was riveting. I felt myself unable to move. It's gutwrenching at times especially as flight controllers watch the towers get hit right across the river from them. The crew and passengers of United 93 turn from passengers to heroes as they become aware of what's going on and that other flights have been rammed into the towers and the pentagon. That American can-do spirit leaves you feeling that we can overcome any horrible terror by coming together. An unbelievable movie experience. Be prepared to shed a tear and to feel some gutwrenching but do watch it.</p></body></html>

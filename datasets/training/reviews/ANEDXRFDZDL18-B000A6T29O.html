<meta name="summary" content="Lara Croft Let Down....."></head><body><p>I am a big fan of 'heroine' action movies, and so I was glad to watch this one.  Angela Jolie, stars as the pouty-lipped, heroine "Lara Croft."<p>This is the story of Lara's discovery of a mysterious clock, hidden in the immense Croft mansion. The clock holds the key to a mystical device which is coveted by an evil cult (aren't they all?) Can Croft prevent the key from falling into the wrong hands?<p> Angela Jolie does her best to breath life into the buxom action heroine, but it was a difficult task. The movie (loosely based upon the videogame) has a meandering action plot, (which seemed to be designed to show Jolie's figure to its best advantage) and an immense special effects budget which might feed a small third world country.<p>While not utterly terrible, in a world of 'video-game' knockoff movies such as 'mortal Kombat' , I can't honestly say that Tomb Raider had much to recommend it unless you are missing your dose of eyecandy for the week. Good for a laugh, but nothing to take to seriously. Next...!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="If Elmore Leonard wrote "Three's Company...""></head><body><p>Quentin Tarantino cops a little from about a million different sources, mixes in some clever (and occasionally overwritten) dialogue, about a billion ..., some standout performances from John Travolta, Samuel L. Jackson (one super-bad cat!), Uma Thurman and Bruce Willis, and comes up with one of the freshest, most influential films in recent years.<br /><p>Travolta and Jackson play two dangerous men in black, paid killers for local kingpin Marcellus Wallace (a glowering, muttering-in-basso Ving Rhames) and they provide the film's central narrative thread.  This bantering pair weaves its way from an early morning hit that ends with a very freakish occurence to a grisly accident to a date with Wallace's lovely wife Mia (Thurman).  Told in a non-linear fashion, the story also manages to incorporate Willis as a pug fighter Wallace has ordered to take a dive (and who has other plans), a death-obsessed cabbie, a pie-loving potbelly-desiring cutie, sexual deviants, and a dance contest at a kitschy 50's-style restaurant.  And then there's the briefcase...<br /><p>Weirdly enough, the film amounts to a kind of hipster/mob sitcom.  Characters get themselves into outlandish situations, and a lot of the film's humor derives from their frantic dialogue as they attempt to extricate themselves.  It's full of quotable quotes, most of which I can't list here, and memorable bits by Christopher Walken, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette and Harvey Keitel as Mr. Wolf, a guy who fixes problems.<br /><p>What's in the case?  It doesn't matter.  What matters is, like that fabled macguffin's mysterious contents, this film dazzles.  It even created a genre, and helped spawn an indie film renaissance of sorts.  Of course, we're probably all a bit weary of smart-alecs with guns popping off rounds and dialogue referencing 70s tv.  And don't worry:  "Pulp Fiction" is not nearly as violent as its reputation; for the most part, Tarantino actually cuts away from the gore and leaves a lot to the viewer's imaginations.  That in itself can be a bit off-putting for some.  For others, bite into this slab of cinema that's as meaty and tasty as a Big Kahuna burger.</p></body></html>

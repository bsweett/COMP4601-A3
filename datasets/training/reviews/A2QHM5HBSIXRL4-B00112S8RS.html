<meta name="summary" content="When Sidney Lumet puts on a show, the names come out"></head><body><p>This stirring drama from master Sidney Lumet - 84 years young at the time of this filming with nothing off his fastball - brings together a group of brilliant Broadway actors for a cracking tale.  Joining co-leads Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Ethan Hawke are established Broadway veterans Amy Ryan, Michael Shannon, Rosemary Harris and Br&iacute;an F. O'Byrne.  Also on hand are Marisa Tomei (and how) and Albert Finney.  When Sidney Lumet puts on a show, the names come out.<br /><br />The storyline itself is one of a family's destruction from within.  Director Lumet had the good sense to suggest that screenwriter Kelly Masterson re-work his two protagonists to be brothers.  It's that dynamic that drives the film.  We see the lives of two brothers gone slowly wrong, the plan they set up as their way out, the execution gone terribly wrong (like these two would suddenly get it right after so much gone wrong?) and the shocking fallout.  Lumet expertly tells the tale and ratchets up the tension at each mile marker.<br /><br />If you liked <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305417830">A Simple Plan</a>, this film is in the same genre: greed; half-baked 'genius' plots; poor execution; family fallout; bad endings for lots of people.  The tension in 'A Simple Plan' was almost unbearable at times.  I got the same feeling here at points.</p></body></html>

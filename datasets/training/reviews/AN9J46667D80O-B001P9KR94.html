It's sweet, it's funny, it's tense, it's uplifting, it's spectacular!<br /><br />The movie tells the story of Jamal, a young Muslim boy (played at various stages by three different actors, but most notably by Dev Patel of Skins fame), who grows up in the slums of Bombay/Mumbai. These slums are the sort of places governments ignore until either a: they catch on fire, b: there's some major world event, like the Commonwealth Games, on the way and they want to clean up the place, or c: the people who live there make them pay attention.<br /><br />Through a series of unlikely events, ends up on India's version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?, where he's about to win the highest jackpot ever. This, of course, leads to questions: is he cheating? How can he be doing this? He's just a boy from the slums, what does he know?<br /><br />As the movie unfolds, we see exactly how he answers the questions: he relates them to moments in his life. His knowledge of American currency, for example, comes up from a blind beggar boy who told him the name of the man whose face is on the $100 bill. There's another moment where he reads a person in a "The Lady or the Tiger" kind of way, trying to figure out if the answer the man fed him is real, or a bluff (for the record, I got the answer right before anything was fed. I have no idea why. It's not like I follow cricket, but at some point I must've picked up that bit of trivia and it stuck in my head, rather like with Jamal).<br /><br />The movie is as flawless as anything I've ever seen. Sure, it's unrealistic; a fairy-tale, basically, but who cares? It's beautifully told with some incredibly good acting and writing. The fact that Dev Patel is not up for an Oscar goes to prove that the Academy is pretty out-of-touch with the world. Well, that plus the fact that they give thirteen nominations to The Curious Case of Benjamin Boring. Even the music is noteworthy. I may well pick up the soundtrack.<br /><br />I cannot possibly praise this film high enough. It is a wonderful, delightful, uplifting movie. If you have a choice this weekend between seeing this and, say, My Bloody Valentine, see this. You can thank me later.<br /><br />One last side note: for reasons unclear to me the MPAA, that bastion of conservative nonsense, has rated this movie R. I have no idea why. Sure, there's a bit of language and you see some mild nudity, but so what? I'd feel quite comfortable taking children as young as eight or nine to this movie, provided they can read well enough to keep up with the occasional subtitles. The MPAA really just needs to be reformed or go away. We deserve better.</p></body></html>

There are three things that redeem this film from the trash heap of total worthlessness.  Harvey Keitel, even in a trashy enterprise like this, delivers a decent performance as a preacher who is grappling with his faith.  Even in junk like this Keitel didn't succumb to the urge to just phone it in.  Cheech Marin has an amusing bit as the strip club's barker.  Lastly, Salma Hayek's snake-dance.  Thank God for chapter search, otherwise, you would have to sit through the rest of this dreck to get to the good parts.  On a final note, Quentin Tarantino delivers one of the worst acting performances known to man.  This is no reflection on the sicko character that he plays, it's just unadulterated bad acting.  Tarantino is a great director but he is no actor.</p></body></html>

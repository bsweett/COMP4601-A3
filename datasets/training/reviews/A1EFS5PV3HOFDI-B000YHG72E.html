<meta name="summary" content="Will Ferrel is definatly comedy relief"></head><body><p>Elf is a movie that will have you either loving or hating it. Although not drop dead funny like the Santa Clause, Elf does have its moments. Most of the time them being Will Ferrel being....well...Will Ferrel.<br /><br />Eg. Buddy (Will Ferrel)dancing for the mail room guys.<br /><br />Buddy asking Jovie (Zooey Deschanel, the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy) out for food. Code named for date.<br /><br />The keebler elfs tree catching on fire while making cookies.<br /><br />Otherwise, its an entertaning movie to say the least, but while children will be amused, adults will likely be bored.<br />James Caan is pretty interesting as the father, but while Mary Steenburgen could have been, she never had enough scenes to be enthralling. Ed Asner as Santa is pretty cool, but no Tim Allen.<br /><br />Plot is pretty basic, Will Ferrel as a child crawls into santa's bag. Is adopted by the elves, and as he grows up begins to realize he's in a class of his own. So the truth comes out, and our hero (Or not) goes off to the magical land of New York to find his father. Who happens to be on the naughty list due to his cynical tactics in the work force i.e childrens books.<br />They pair meet up, and must deal with the differences of a chemically unbalanced elf, and a rather selfish-hard boiled father. Thrown into the mix of this self same elf falling in love and coping in an unfamilier world.<br /><br />Basic plot however funny and entertaning I found it. A truly enjoyable christmas movie, Will Ferrell is not to be missed. however rent it first. Right after watching The Santa Clause with Tim Allen, and you'll be sure to have an enjoyable holiday.</p></body></html>

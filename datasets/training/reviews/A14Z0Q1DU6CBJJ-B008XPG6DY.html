<meta name="summary" content="DERAILED victim of its own HYPE"></head><body><p>The only thing wrong with DERAILED is that the overpromotion and intense media-barage touted this as the second coming of the suspense thriller... my god... HITCHCOCK LIVES!!<br /><br />The truth is. The movie was actually pretty good. There are some nice twists. There are some surprises. The performances are good. But, once you TELL EVERYBODY that your movie is the greatest thing since sliced bread... IT BETTER BE.<br /><br />DERAILED... is just pretty good. Nothing exceptional. But certainly not a waste of time.<br /><br />The story unfolds as a businessman Philippe LaRoche (played by Clive Owen) is bored with his life and his troubles and finds himself embarking on an extra-marital affair with Lucinda Harris (Jennifer Aniston), a stranger who he met on a train. At the hotel, things go badly and many secrets have to be regrettably held as the perpetrators seek to extort the wealthy businessman.<br /><br />Many of the twists are foreshadowed too obviously. Although there are enough twists in the film, that some WILL SURPRISE you. I would have liked to have seen a couple of the characters brought out more. Shown a little deeper. Specifically Philippe LaRoche's wife and daughter, Deanna & Amy Schine (played by Melissa George & Addison Timlin respectively). There were some stories that could have been told about them that would have made you care deeper for the family situation.<br /><br />Otherwise, the movie is just okay. It's a good renter. Certainly not a bad film. But certainly not the second-coming of Hitchcock either.</p></body></html>

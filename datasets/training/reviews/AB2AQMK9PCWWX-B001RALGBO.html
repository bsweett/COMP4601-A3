Additionally, do you believe that Quaid could have survived the walk to New York (for his son) in the subzero arctic temperatures...? That's what makes it a piece of movie fiction, I guess. How come no one thought to fire up (really fire up) a nuclear reactor is beyond me. That would have melted those mutant ice floes for sure...to say nothing of creating genetic anomalies all over the joint...to say nothing of creating massive amounts of water everywhere. It is an entertaining though flawed and claustrophobic disaster flick that will hold your attention for a spell. I however think that if there were massive weather changes because of greenhousing and ozone depletion, we'd be more prone to fry in boiling temperatures...but I am no meteorologist...</p></body></html>

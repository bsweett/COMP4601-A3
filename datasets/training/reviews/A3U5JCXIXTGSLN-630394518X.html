<meta name="summary" content="Disturbing and Scary!"></head><body><p>Disturbing and scary don't seem like good enough words to describe the film, "Seven". This movie is a psychological thriller in which a serial killer kills his victims by using the seven deadly sins: pride, envy, gluttony, lust, anger, greed, and sloth. Of course you're disturbed by the killings and dark, damp feel of the movie, but you also learn about the message that the killer was ultimately trying to relay - although he didn't have to kill to get his point across.<p>Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman did great jobs playing the lead characters, and Kevin Spacey is chilling as the killer. This is definitely a movie you want to watch with a friend and with the lights on!</p></body></html>

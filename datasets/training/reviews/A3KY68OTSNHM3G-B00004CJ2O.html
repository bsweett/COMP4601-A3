<meta name="summary" content="The Beginning of a Legendary Series of Horror Films"></head><body><p>This movie has become one of the most well-known horror movies ever made. It continues to be as popular and scary today as when it was when it was first released in 1980.<br /><br />The story goes like this. Camp Crystal Lake has been shut down for over twenty years.  In 1958, two camp counselors were brutally murdered, and the year before, a young boy drowned in the lake because the counselors were not paying any attention to him.  The boy's name was Jason Voorhies.<br /><br />Fast forward to the "present day".  Steve Christy (Peter Brower) has purchased Camp Crystal Lake with the intention of re-opening it as a campground for inner-city children to spend their summers.  Steve has hired six counselors: Alice (Adrienne King), Bill (Harry Crosby), Marcie (Jeannine Taylor), Annie (Robbi Morgan), Ned (Mark Nelson), Claudette (Debra hayes), and Jack (Kevin Bacon).  Their job is to clean up the camp to get it ready for a group of children who are due to be arriving.  Despite the warnings of the camp being called a curse and many of the locals calling it "camp blood", the group presses on with their work.<br /><br />Soon, however, this peaceful campground once again turns into a nightmare as the camp counselors are mercilessly killed until only Alice is left.  As she tries to escape, she is confronted by a woman who introduces herself as Mrs. Voorhies.  Initially, Alice is relieved, but her relief quickly turns to terror as she discovers that Mrs. Voorhies is the one who is responsible for the deaths of the others.  Will Alice survive, or will she meet the same fate as her friends?<br /><br />This movie and its nine highly successful sequels have become classics of the horror movie genre.  What makes this movie so scary is that the majority of the action takes place in the dark, so the fear factor is heightened by the absence of daylight.  The rolling thunderstorm also adds to the suspense.  The story of the movie is excellent, and the young boy in the lake will become legendary in the films that followed this one.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie.  The level of terror and suspense is quite high throughout the movie, and the story is very good.  This movie is a must-see for horror movie fans, as well as all of the successful sequels that followed.  Watch this movie and meet one of the true legends of horror films.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Poignantly Riviting Bergmanesque Experience..."></head><body><p>A relationship commences the instant two individuals meet.  Eye contact leads to conversation which builds a connection between the people involved in the mutual communication.  This moment of communication is occasionally emotionally loaded where the involved begin to explore each other's compatibilities.  If there is a mutual harmony the conversation usually progresses.  However, communication is not the only thing needed for a romantic relationship, as the possibility of physical closeness where an opportunity of sharing thoughts, feelings, and secrets brings about a bond of trust.  Trust is what unites people, as they let the other closer into themselves with the intention of mutual expectation of protection and nurturing love.  Some have much difficulty building this trust as it can take years after a painful memory when their trust once was broken.  Closer brings the audience the moment where trust begins and ends in a visual dissection of human emotions where pain, suffering, love, trust, and much more are explored.<br /><br />Closer offers a Bergmanesque experience which dives deep into the psyche of the four main characters of the story.  Through the four characters the audience is allowed into a secret and personal world, a world most can identify through self scrutiny.  In a sense, Closer comes closer to the audience, as the mirror of our thoughts and feelings creeps slowly closer until we can feel the cold reflective surface pressing against our noses.  Yet, it is also distinctively unique as the situation, location, and the words that are said are strange and unfamiliar to the audience, as the viewers bring their own notions, experiences, values, and morals to the viewing of the film.  Nonetheless, the director Mike Nichols, with the help of the four talented actors in the film, brings the audience a long painful lesson of how people are getting closer to one another.<br /><br />The story opens in London with Dan (Jude Law) taking his morning stroll to work, as he does everyday, when he stumbles across a refreshing sight in the American girl Alice (Natalie Portman).  Alice is accidentally hit by a car which brings them closer for the moment, as their closeness to one another continues through Dan's nurturing care for Alice's injury.  Initially they study each other visually, through words, and touch, as they begin to build an emotional bond through humor and personal thoughts.  This is the beginning of a romantic relationship that brings them close, but it does not eliminate a tiny space between them as Dan never truly gives himself to Alice.  It appears as if Dan is looking for something else, yet he is not really sure what it is he is looking for, but he seems to be looking for something better.  Yet, Dan remains within the relationship, maybe out of convenience and because he does not want to hurt Alice.  The mental absence of Dan creates an emotional distance between them, which Alice feels strongly as she senses a looming pain being sent her way at any moment through Dan leaving her.<br /><br />Through a couple of years of living together Dan has reached more success as a writer, maybe with the emotional support of Alice, and he is to take a picture for his upcoming book.  Taking the picture is a stunning American, Anna (Julia Roberts), who tells Dan that she liked his book, as he notices portraits around in the photo studio that catch his eye.  This begins an infatuation between Anna and Dan.  It seems as if Dan seeks someone equally successful that can provide additional emotional support to elevate his career.  In a sense, Dan seems to be an emotional opportunist that craves affection, yet he is incapable of fully providing for others who need it as much.<br /><br />On the internet, in a chat room, Dan pretends to be Anna where he meets Larry (Clive Owen), a medical doctor, as they preoccupy themselves with cybersex.  Eventually, this chatting leads to them planning a rendezvous at the city aquarium, as Dan has learned that Anna likes to find people there to take their portrait.  Larry who is all excited about the planned meeting finds himself in a somewhat awkward situation, as he realizes that he has been set up.  Nonetheless, Anna and Larry seem to find each other, as they begin to date through Dan's little prank which turns him into cupid.<br /><br />The film continues to explore more of the four characters personal psychology, and what drives them to do what they are doing.  Nichols cleverly depicts how they get closer through terrific visuals and a well-written script, which balances the brilliant performances of the small cast.  The visuals bring out their unique personalities through delicately balanced contrasts, warm and cold lighting, and mise-en-scene that offers both closeness and distance.  These visual elements enhance the emotionally painful moments where the cast must bring out the best of themselves in order to make it feel authentic, which they do to perfection.  This makes the lines sound vibrant and alive while hurtful and loving words are exchanged in the privacy of the characters.  At last, the film offers a poignantly brilliant cinematic experience that tears the soul and rips the heart while they all are trying to find a way to get closer to one another.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="PUNCH THAT S#%@!!!"></head><body><p>This is definitely the funniest comedy of 2007. Simon Pegg, Edgar Wright, and Nick Frost make a great trio. With their knowledge of action movies deemed both good and bad, they make a motion picture that's filled with high-octane action, impressive suspense, magnificent slapstick humor, and tons of blood and guts. It may be a bit too long for some (two hours can be too much for a comedy), but I didn't find any tedium anywhere in the film. Mostly it's because I was too immersed in the characters and the comedy. Speaking of characters, Nicholas Angel (Pegg) and Danny Butterman (Frost) has to be one of the most popular duos of this generation. Like in Shaun of the Dead, they sure know how to be loved by those who're into action, suspense, and comedy. Timothy Dalton, along with the rest of the supporting comedic ensemble, makes this even more memorable. And David Arnold's score really something worth mentioning: the synthesizers along with the orchestra is a perfect combination for this sort of movie.<br /><br />If you love Shaun of the Dead and the Spaced TV series, then you'll probably get a kick out of Hot Fuzz if you're into mindless action and smart comedy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="How much blood would you shed to stay alive?"></head><body><p>From those who liked Saw (2004) `A Cut Above the Rest', `I Came, I Saw', `See Saw', `One Severed Thumb Up', `What I Saw Was Good', to those who didn't, `(S)awful', `Wish I Never Saw This', `Saw Just Couldn't Cut It', `Saw It Coming', it seems like many of the clever title variations have already been used, leaving me with...nothing (okay, it's early and I was up late last night, so gimme a break)...co-written and directed by James Wan, the film stars Cary Elwes (The Princess Bride, Days of Thunder) and Leigh Whannell, who co-wrote the film with director Wan.  Also appearing is Danny Glover (Grand Canyon, Gone Fishin'), Dina Meyer (Starship Troopers - she was the redhead who got topless in the group shower), Ken Leung (Vanilla Sky), Shawnee Smith, whom many may recognize from television's Becker as the dumb as a brick character of Linda, and cute as a button Monica Potter (Along Came a Spider).<br /><br />The movie opens, oddly enough, in my bathroom, or, at least a very good facsimile...it's dark, dank, slimy, dirty, gritty, moldy, and generally funkified, as my good friend Robbie Van Winkle used to say, to the extreme.  As the florescent lights come to life, we see three men, two alive, one dead (I'm assuming this as he was laying face down on the icky tile in a pool of his own blood with a ginormous hole in the back of his head).  The two remaining men, Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Elwes) and Adam (Whannell), find themselves not only wondering how they came to be in such a place, but why they are shackled by the ankle to large pipes, each at opposite ends of the room.  Some answers are found on cassette tapes found in their respective pockets (the dead man in the middle of the room had a player) in that of a raspy voice and various clues that indicate the survival of the two men, among others, depends on their having to perform some unusual acts (two men in a bathroom performing unusual acts?  No, this isn't a George Michael video...).  The question soon becomes one of what someone would be willing to do to stay alive, and the answers may shock you...<br /><br />The general opinion for Saw seems clearly divided, and I can see both sides...but I enjoyed this nasty little movie, for what it was...so many have already compared it to (or claimed it ripped off) the popular film Se7en, so it must be true, but I found myself likening the tone of the film to the ambiguously dark and disturbing videos released by the band Tool in the 90's (I think they're still performing, but with a slightly different line up).  I think most agree the acting in Saw isn't the best, Cary Elwes' performance the most flawed, and there's a good many plot holes, but I think the good outweighed the bad, and the end result was favorable.  I was a little disappointed that Glover and Potter's roles weren't more substantial, but the upside was the story moved at a brisk pace.  The movie had a really strong opening, and kept me interested throughout, although it did sort of peter out as it went along...I will say that not once did I look at the running time left to figure out how much more I had to sit through (I'll do this often with films that bore me).  Did I find the movie scary?  Not really, but it was tense, unsettling, and definitely creepy.  I like how things unfolded, as the audience starts out knowing exactly what the main characters do, which is very little, and then revelations present themselves, but even as we become more informed (more so than the main characters), what are we to believe?  One or two of these elements were easy to discern as a means to throw us off (especially those regarding the identity of the mysterious Jigsaw killer, as he was named), but for the most part, I found myself second-guessing my theories.  The sets for the film so clearly fit the dark nature of the material, especially the dilapidated bathroom where a majority of the story took place.  My favorite scene involved Adam, learning from a clue that there may be something of use in the toilet, reaching into the thick, brown, water in the bowl...I dunno about you, but I would've checked the tank first, as I think most know the best place to hide something in a toilet would be the tank, and not the bowl... Dr, Gordon then asks, "Find anything?", to which Adam replies, "Nothing solid..." Hee hee...he then realizes it's the tank he should be looking in, and admonishes himself appropriately.  No, this isn't a comedy, but it does have a few humorous moments that were integrated nicely to enhance an overall sense of realism.  I wouldn't call this a straight up horror film, but more of a crime thriller with horror elements.  The main element that really intrigued me was the idea of placing people in situations where they have the choice of doing nothing and dying, or doing something really dangerous and quite possibly lethal (to themselves or others) for the remote chance of surviving (You know, if the producers of that Fear Factor show had any cajones, they would more closely model their show on this concept...it'd be a ratings bonanza).  In the end, looking at the film for what it is, an inexpensive (under 2 mil, I think), quickly shot (18 days), glossy initial outing, I'd say it turned out very well, and is worth checking out for a few thrills.<br /><br />The anamorphic widescreen print looks great, with matching audio.  Special features include a short featurette titled `Sawed Off), rated and unrated version of the Cold Play video `Bite the Hand That Bleeds You', trailers and TV spots, a poster gallery, a commentary track with Wan and Whannell, and a cool, transparent case with an artwork overlay.<br /><br />Cookieman108<br /><br />By the way, if you dug this cinematic nugget, be on the lookout for the sequel, aptly titled Saw II, coming sometime in 2005.</p></body></html>

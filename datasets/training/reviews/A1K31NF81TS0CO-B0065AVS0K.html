<meta name="summary" content="Awesome!  One of my top 10 favorite movies!!!"></head><body><p>I bought this on launch day for the UMD and DVD versions!  I bought a copy for my homedawg, DJ Honeybear, and the UMD version for myself!  I could not believe the cinematic brilliance of this movie!  Truely one of the best cinematic features I've ever seen in my life!<br /><br />Somebody else said "jawdropping video presentation" or words to that effect, and I would have to agree with that!  Clearly an award winner in this department!<br /><br />Just writing this review and reading the other reviews, is making me want to rewatch it.  I also will probably get the DVD special edition of this movie by this Holiday.<br /><br />Highly recommended!!!<br /><br />MC White said:  Check it out!!!!</p></body></html>

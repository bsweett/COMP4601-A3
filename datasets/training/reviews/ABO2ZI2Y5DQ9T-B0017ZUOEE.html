The Spanish film is a rather remarkable effort in that, like a classic ghost story, the film, which cleverly uses some of the familiar elements from horror genre, favors atmosphere over logic, and it works.<br /><br />The following paragraphs contain a mild spoiler.<br /><br />[STORY] Laura (Bel&eacute;n Rueda) comes back to the abandoned orphanage by the sea 30 years after she left the place. This is where she was raised when she was a little girl, and Laura is going to open a new orphanage here for the handicapped children with her husband and adapted son Sim&oacute;n. When everything is going well, however, some strange things start to happen. And finally during the party Sim&oacute;n disappears suddenly, as if spirited away.<br /><br />Some say "The Orphanage" is a ghost story, some a supernatural thriller. Whatever the film is, it owes its success to Bel&eacute;n Rueda as Laura. The Spanish star literally becomes the character she plays, a tormented mother whose beloved son is long missing. Her acting is so strong and her character's sadness sometimes so painful to see that "The Orphanage" ultimately becomes an intense mother-and-son drama, even though the son is not always there.<br /><br />True, most of the narrative devices in the Spanish film "The Orphanage" are not particularly new - a little boy "speaking" with his "imaginary friend" or the "secrets" of an old house have been dealt with so many times before. But there is something very unique about The Orphanage," that is, something unnerving that curiously stays in your mind long after watching the film itself. It is hard for me to describe the nature of it. Maybe it is the shocking "truths" about the orphanage and the missing case. Or maybe it is some of the film's very spooky scenes or the ending that defies our expectations. All I can say is see for yourself.<br /><br />The film is co-produced by Guillermo del Toro, of "Pan's Labyrinth."</p></body></html>

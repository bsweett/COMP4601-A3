<meta name="summary" content="Very Good, If You Didn't Read The Book Or See Manhunter"></head><body><p>This film ALMOST makes it, and will be considered a hit by those who are not familiar with the book and its original movie rendition, Manhunter.  For anyone who appreciates the book, this new movie falls short in several ways.<p>Will Graham in this movie simply does not evoke the same degree of audience/reader sympathy as in the earlier presentations.  The book painted him as an injured soul, a man with a gift he hated but was unable to resist using.  His abilities had almost cost his life, and he definitely did not want to enter the investigation arena again -- but then Jack Crawford showed up with photos.  Manhunter's William Petersen portrayed this emotional conflict extremely well, while Edward Norton merely seemed to be reading his lines.<p>Compensating for that weakness somewhat are Red Dragon's plot details (with exceptions, below), which presented far more material from the book than did the first film.  We see the original capture of Hannibal Lecter, along with expository information about Francis Dolarhyde's upbringing, which explained how the latter was driven to uncontrollable anger.  Also we see the hatred between Drs. Chilton and Lecter, particularly that sweet scene wherein Lecter had accidentally received a rejection letter intended for Chilton.  These two doctors were meant for each other.<p>Missing, however, were Graham's struggles and connection with the case, his dreams about his family and the musings that gave us a glimpse of his thought processes.  Non-vital but stinging moments were omitted -- the Leeds' phone ringing while Graham was at that murder scene, and Valerie Leeds' voice on the recorder; Graham's admonition to Crawford, "I'm not going to recognize him standing on a street corner" and identify him; Graham's bitter declaration, after being sucked into the case, "It's just you and me now, sport" -- these instances in which we identified with the hero were replaced by sensational (and fabricated) scenes featuring Hannibal Lecter.<p>Lecter, it was implied here, conceptually solved the case early on, hinting that the killer was visually attracted to the women he murdered.  The real Will Graham actually solved the case on his own; the only reason he had visited Lecter in the first place was "to get the scent back."  Graham observed, retained and analyzed; he was far more naturally talented than Clarice Starling, whose primary asset was determination.  Graham's legwork appears more extensively in the book and the first film, while the new version supplants all that shoe leather with visits to Lecter.<p>The sad fact is, this remade movie was warped to a significant extent in order to accommodate box-office drawing card Anthony Hopkins.  It would have been a lot better if they had just stuck to the author's original story and hired a younger, less famous actor to play Hannibal.  Someone as powerful as Brian Cox was, in Manhunter.</p></body></html>

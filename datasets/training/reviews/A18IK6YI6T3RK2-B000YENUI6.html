<meta name="summary" content="WHITE RUSSIAN"></head><body><p>Viggo Mortensen and David Cronenberg are a match made it film heaven, this film follows on the heels of the great "The History of Violence", which was riviting as well.  Cronenberg's movies can be almost hyper violent and this one has a harrowing scene in which a bare Mortensen does battle with two Ukranian thugs, I mean let's face it, this guys movies are not for the squimish.  I like Watts and Mortensens chemistry, Viggo does dark and mysterious better than anyone in film, and Watts, though her character is unbelieveably naive, does her best with a sort of thankless role, this movie is really about Mortensen and his relationship to mob scion Kirill and to Russian mob boss, Mueller-Stahl, who is fantastic as usual, he's chilling as this family head, who dispises his son, Kirill, but yet cannot help but indulge him, he is his spawn afterall.  The movie is set in the mysterious Russian underworld in modern day London and the city real adds character to the film.  Eastern Promises gives an interesting look at the Russian mob, it's seeming obsession with Tatoos and its inner workings.  The film takes some interesting turns and has a nice twist, really as in, "The History of Violence", this film rises and falls on the performance of Mortensen.  Highly recommended, but not to the faint at heart.</p></body></html>

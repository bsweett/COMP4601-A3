<meta name="summary" content="My favorite horror film of all time."></head><body><p>This was one of the first horror films that I ever saw in my life. Ever since the first time, it has been a tradition for me to watch this film at least once or twice every year, preferably on a dark and stormy night. Jack Nicholson does an excellent job as the psychopath who tries to do away with his wife and son, after succombing "cabin fever". Shelley Duvall is both effective and annoying as Jack's mousy little wife. Ah, I love it all. Who cares if it strays from the book? They are both great on their own terms, and you should just look at it that way.<br /><br />I read that Kubrick would leave the film "Eraserhead" playing on the set to create a sense of dread in the actors. Awesome!<br /><br />How I miss the Kubrick.</p></body></html>

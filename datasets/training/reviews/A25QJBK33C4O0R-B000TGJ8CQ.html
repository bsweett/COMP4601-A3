<meta name="summary" content="A taut action thriller, it should be in your future"></head><body><p>Didn't last long in theatres and I wasn't expecting that much from the movie based on reviews that I had seen, but this is a nice, taut, action thriller.<br /><br />It looks very sharp on HD DVD and features some beautiful images from the Grand Canyon area, and oh, yeah, by the way features some pretty beautiful images of the tight Ms. Jessica Biel, along with a no-nonsense, take charge Federal Agent played by Julianne Moore.  Nicholas Cage does a great job as a small time magician that actually has a big time power -- the ability to look into the future, his future, to see what lies ahead.<br /><br />The movie is fast paced, and the action rarely slows, but there are a few breath-taking scenes that do add in some of the most beautiful scenery that could ever be filmed.  Well worth adding to your video collection :-)</p></body></html>

At times I wondered if it was all an act. Treadwell is (unintentionally?) funny, the coroner creepy, and both seemed like B-grade actors.<br /><br />Was Treadwell gay? I think so, and even though some will argue that it does not matter, to the extent that he was running away from society, from people with whom he could not or would not be honest, that led him to Alaska and ultimately into a bear's tummy for dinner.<br /><br />Was Treadwell mentally ill? He certainly seemed a quarter or two short of a dollar. It's one thing for a young child or even a daydreaming teenager to have grandiose dreams and to humanize animals (although I suppose Mr. Chocolate *was* hungry!). It's quite another thing when a failed actor and former drug addict in his mid-40s does it.<br /><br />Was Treadwell selfish? Unequivocally, yes. In the end he got his girlfriend killed, not to mention two grizzly bears.<br /><br />I am reminded of Into the Wild (the book, as I have not yet seen the film): Weirdo goes up to Alaska and gets himself dead...tonight at 11. Yet Krakauer's book succeeds where Herzog's film fails. That is, creating a personal connection between the protagonist and the storyteller. Krakauer uses his own harrowing experiences as a mountain climber to gain insight into Christopher McCandless' demons, while Herzog simply uses Treadwell's own videotapes and words against him, possibly making the bear lover out to be even crazier than he was.<br /><br />I tend to side with naturalist (and true bear expert) Charlie Russell. From whom did Treadwell think he was protecting the bears? Why did he so unnecessarily put himself in harm's way? To set himself up as a hero, probably. My guess is he intended to sell his own movie. To be fair, Treadwell took time to observe animals in their natural habitat, but he crossed the line. He loved the grizzlies as most of us would love a stuffed teddy bear. But, he abused this relationship. On an appearance with David Letterman in 2001, Treadwell called the bears "party animals." He was disconnected from reality, but his luck and the bears' own self-restraint kept him alive for more than a dozen years. As Deb Liggett, National Park Service Superintendent (Katmai and Lake Clark National Parks and Preserves), told the Anchorage Daily News two years prior to Treadwell's death, "At best, he's misguided. At worst, he's dangerous."<br /><br />One star for the bears and foxes and another for the cautionary tale this documentary tells. Anything higher risks idolizing this idiot.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Phantom "Swan" Menace"></head><body><p>This film would appear to be based on mental illness. A disease that most of the times goes untreated and ignored until it is too late. In this story we meet Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman). She has been working very hard at becoming the prima ballerina in her New York City Ballet company.<br /><br />However, underneath that determined facade, there is a load of guilt placed there by her mother, who gave up such an opportunity in order to give birth to Nina. A side spin off of her mother's over-controlling ways is that Nina has become sexually repressed, and is not in touch with her sexuality, neither has she fully come to terms with being a young adult female. As a result, she is innocently led into some sexual experiences.<br /><br />The main concept in this movie is that it attempts to deal with parallels and opposites:<br /><br />[1] In the Ballet production, there is the White swan and the Black Swan, which for this production must both be played by Nina.<br /><br />[2] In her personal life, she begins also to display a split personality, and at times it would appear that she deliberately cuts herself. In her "white" personality, she is a virgin, and does everything to please and obey her mother, on the other hand, her "black" personality is defiant, and is sexually promiscuous.<br /><br />The bottom line is that Nina, is in desperate need of help. Everyone else seems just too busy with their own ambitions and personal goals to really notice. She is haunted by visions of her very own self. A self that is tired of all the rules and tired of all the pressure.<br /><br />The big question is, who will really win: Nina or the phantom of herself that haunts her?<br /><br />2011 Best Actress Nominee:<br /><br />It should be noted that Natalie Portman has been nominated by the Academy Awards for Best Actress because of this role. Her role was quite demanding, physically in terms of the dancing involved, emotionally in terms of duality of the roles that she had to play, and then there was the simulated sexual content (which I personally did not care for).</p></body></html>

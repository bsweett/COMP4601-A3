<meta name="summary" content="Best Civil War-Hollywood-Style film ever!"></head><body><p>As President Lincoln credited the men of colour with helping to turn the tide of war so do I credit the makers of this truly exceptional civil war film in helping to turn the tide of filmmaking. Performances are all top notch. Sound and music are pulse-pounding in dolby surround. Battle scenes are recreated with an intensity rivaled only by films such as Saving Private Ryan and Platoon. This is the definitive Civil War film.<p>  If you are aware of the real story behind the 54th Regiment who made the assault on Fort Wagner, then this will bring that story to life. Denzel Washington won a well-deserved Academy Award for his work, and I am surprised that the special effects crew did not win one as well.</p></body></html>

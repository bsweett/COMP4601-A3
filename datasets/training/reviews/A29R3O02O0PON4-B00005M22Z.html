Because I like Sci-Fi and while having a History degree I found the Egyptology interesting.<p>Now then, a comment about the guy who doesn't like Letterboxing.  Umm, dude!  DVDs are made for Widescreen presentations!  The letterboxing MAINTAINS the theatrical presentation.  Unless your local theater has a 4:3 screen then you're missing at least a third of the picture by LOVING Pan'n'Scan.  I hate to see what you're going to do when HDTVs are the norm in their 16:9 format.  If anything I HATE watching movies in Pan'n'Scan because I KNOW that there is more picture there that I'm not seeing.  I've been watching VHS widescreen versions for years now on a 27&quot; and have no problem &quot;tuning-out&quot; the black bars.  I have just bought a DVD player and a 32&quot; Sony WEGA Trinitron and Widescreen hasn't looked better.  One step down from HD.<p>But now back to the film itself.  Stargate is about a circular gate that is a portal from one point in space to another through a wormhole.  The portal in this film is one to a planet that apparently has simularities to Earth's Ancient Egypt.  Except the Gods are aliens that have adopted ancient Egyption dieties for appearances.  We have the pharoah-looking Sun God Rah, the jackal-looking Anubis, and the eagle-looking Horus.  They also have cool looking skypods armed with the same energy weapon that the ground troops carry.  <p>The film could have been better had the locale and culture of the people there on the alien planet been a little more dynamic.  But at least it spawned a highly successful TV series where these alien worlds and story lines could be fleshed out more.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Fantastic B&W Cinematograpy on Blu Ray will Astound You"></head><body><p>Hi Def makes B&W show the artistic attention put into film back in the day!<br />I looked at the Casablanca BD and, 'Wow', the HD format is perfect for serious B&W cinematography. Yes this is worth the upgrade just to see how classic B&W films CAN look at home on your system. It is in mono and it is square and if that's a problem; you got a problem. The Day the Earth Stood Still BD and this in the same week. I'm feeling good about Blu-Ray.<br /> I have issues with the packaging, The lattice case should have been on heaver stock and the box holding the 'uninteresting passport & luggage tag' makes the whole thing twice its size! An irritating waste of space; but I have a solution. I'm going to shrink wrap some sand, label it 'Exclusive Moroccan Sand' and slide it into the offending box! Cigarette butts were suggested. There is a nice coffee table book & lobby cards inside; and the discs have lots of extras.<br />24 hrs. and the lattice die cut Casablanca cover is already falling apart. Now it's an 'arts & craft' project; thank you. Warners' art department has been taken over by turnips from outer space. The special packaging is a rip-off, but the discs are worth it.</p></body></html>

This film bordered on pretentiousness, like a blood sucking viper it drained the life out of me.  I'm not down with the whole "spidey" thing, and all the bouncing off buildings and loud thuds and bangs?  It's like does spider man drive a camaro? Wink, wink.  It's like, get a life and start on a new action hero like Green Lantern or anybody at this point.  When they make movies like Spider Man 3, they keep repeating the same actions and expecting different results at the end.  Both me and my roomate literally fell asleep through this, but at different times, me first and then him.  I don't need to see the rest of the film, you couln't PAY me.</p></body></html>

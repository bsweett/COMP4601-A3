<meta name="summary" content="first rate sci fi and deeper than the 1st"></head><body><p>Contrary to popular opinion, I found this version better than the 1st part, better sci fi really.  What is so good about this film is that a lot is added, but not too much:  you get intimations of deeper things that can stimulate the imagination without laying it all out, which would stretch credibility too far.  I love the way the references are somewhat obscure and cryptic.  The actions scenes are also extremely good, while different from the 1st one.  And the acting, well, even Keanu Reeves - who is my book is a 2nd-rater - is excellent.  Taken together, this is the best sci-fi film I have seen in years.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Religious and deeply moving"></head><body><p>I liked Paul Thomas Anderson's &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; when I saw it a few years ago, so I gave &quot;Magnolia&quot; a shot after stumbling over it at the video store. The promise of a three plus hour runtime did not put me off in any significant way: I often enjoy reading very long books or watching lengthy films because I always figure that more time equals more character development and better background. I even violated one of my usual rules--reading a few reviews about a film or book before diving in--and watched &quot;Magnolia&quot; with precious little information about the plot. Even after learning that Tom Cruise and Julianne Moore starred in this film, two actors I usually despise, I STILL decided to give this one a chance. What really suckered me in was the roughly ten minute opening sequence, one of the most original and intriguing opening sequences I have ever seen in a movie, about a murder filled with amazing coincidences hinting at inescapable fate. I logically assumed from this information that &quot;Magnolia&quot; would take as a central theme the power of coincidence and human fate. Well, I wasn't far off because these two ideas inform a significant part of the movie. But there is something else going on here that transcends these ideas and moves Anderson's picture into the realm of the religious.<p>&quot;Magnolia&quot; concerns a day in the life of a host of characters both big and small in modern day Los Angeles. Hollywood bigwig Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) lays dying of cancer in the living room of his house, attended only by a caring male nurse (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) and his confused and drug addicted wife (Julianne Moore). Partridge's estranged son, a seedy infomercial misogynist named Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom Cruise), knows nothing about his father's impending death and probably wouldn't care much if he did. His concern at the present is a taped interview he agreed to do with a nosy reporter, an interview that ominously threatens to lift the carefully crafted veil of secrecy Mackey placed around his personal life and childhood. Having his dirty laundry aired publicly inspires Frank to look deep into his soul and make a painful decision about whether he should reconcile with his past or not.<p>Meanwhile, a show Partridge once produced, called &quot;What Do Kids Know,&quot; is airing in another part of town. The long time host of the show, Jimmy Gator, discovers he has an incurable illness. The show must go on, though, so Jimmy walks out on stage to fire questions at the current wunderkind, Stanley Berry. Stanley suffers privately from the attentions of his overbearing father, a guy who pushes his son to succeed on the show at any cost. Related to the television show are Jimmy's wife Rose (Melinda Dillon), his drug addicted daughter Claudia, and former child star Donnie Smith. Smith once appeared on some of Partridge's shows but has since fallen on hard times. His job at an appliance/electronics store has just dropped out from under him and he can't seem to line up a date with the bartender at his favorite pub. Jimmy's daughter Claudia, who hates her father for initially unspecified behavior, meets up with a clumsy yet macho<br />cop named Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly) and begins to tentatively connect with him. <p>I know you can get this cast information from nearly anywhere. I just wanted to see if I could untangle the byzantine structure of this film in the space of two short paragraphs. There are many more characters parading through the scenes of &quot;Magnolia,&quot; and Anderson carefully ties them all together without ever bogging down. Obviously, the cast list isn't nearly as important as what these characters do and how the actors portray their deeds. All of the performances in this film are excellent. Tom Cruise steps out on a limb here as the insensate Mackey, a guy who tries to deal with his emotional baggage by dumping on women in his &quot;Seduce and Destroy&quot; infomercials. As good a job as Cruise does here, John C. Reilly steals the show in the role of police officer Jim Kurring. His manic behavior, his eternal patience (see the amusing scene with the lady in the apartment), and his rigid opinions about right and wrong are often hilarious and deeply sad at the same time. Everyone here should pat themselves on the back for a job well done.<p>The first part of the movie defines the various characters and explains their situations. Then comes the emotional roller coaster ride as nearly every person in the movie suffers a humiliating set back of some type. Mackey's lies about his past become known in deeply embarrassing ways. Officer Kurring loses his firearm; a huge humiliation for a cop. Jimmy Gator and Stanley Berry both undergo enormously awkward situations during the filming of the television show (in front of a live audience, no less). Physical and emotional pain comes spilling out from nearly every character about midway through the movie. Then something remarkable happens: the healing begins. The characters &quot;sin&quot; and then atone for their behavior in various ways. I saw someone refer to this movie as a Christian picture, and I think that claim is true to some extent. A frog fall that would make Charles Fort proud might make some viewers doubt the veracity of this claim, but even this odd event towards the end of the film has a scriptural basis. Can Hollywood make a Christian film in these modern times? Apparently. Match the religious themes with a great soundtrack, the performances, and the somber feel of the film and you have the makings for a marvelous three-hour experience. Give &quot;Magnolia&quot; a glance soon.</p></body></html>

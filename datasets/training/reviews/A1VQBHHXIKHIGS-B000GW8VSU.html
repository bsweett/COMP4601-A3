How does the update stand up?<br /><br />Well, once they moved the setting to Iraq, cleaned up the muddy surrealism, sobered up the star, and played it straight, there was absolutely no subtlety whatsoever to the political message. Like dropping a bowling ball on a birthday cake. Or Chinese cinema. "We will tell you what to think." The locals might mistake it for a documentary. I quit watching after 30 minutes.<br /><br />You just can't carry an entire movie with a "fake war hero via hypnosis" plot. No movie should hinge on a single plot point, and if it does, please don't make it a boring one. No disrespect to Denzel Washington intended. He played Frank Sinatra so well that co-producer Tina Sinatra probably got goosebumps. And what a waste of Meryl Streep. She did a great job and it didn't matter.<br /><br />But hey, one of the beauties of watching DVDs in China is that I don't blow three hours' pay on each movie.<br /><br />As a brief aside, show ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST to 155 Chinese students. This film refuses to tell them what to think, and that confuses the hell out of them. Then they ask you, Mr. Teacher Person, to explain the film's message. Um, it's about your school, but I'm not saying that.</p></body></html>

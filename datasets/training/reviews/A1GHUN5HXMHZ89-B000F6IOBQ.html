Those that missed the first one can watch this as a standalone but it will make more since if you go back and see Underworld first. I know I went back and re-watched Underworld before seeing Evolution. If you have never seen Underworld, but you are a fan of any vampire or werewolf movies you will probably enjoy these. Imagine a world where there are three races. Humans, Vampires, and Werewolves. Now imagine The Vampires and Werewolves are at war over an ancient dispute. The first Underworld clarifies why. The second Underworld is the evolution of lycans and vampires, reflection on past events, the the continuation of the relationship between a human that became part werewolf and part vampire and a vampiress, and a big Lycan vs Vampire showdown. Fans of the "Blade" trilogy should definitely not be disappointed. I recommend it for at least a rental to anyone that hasn't seen the first one and a go ahead and buy for those that enjoyed Underworld.</p></body></html>

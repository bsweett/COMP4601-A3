<meta name="summary" content="a study in psychological dance"></head><body><p>If  you are not a fan of psychological thrillers and such then this may not be your cup of tea, obviously the shallow minded one star reviewers mostly don't like this type of flick. (other than those who though this was a movie about the love of dance! and were shocked to get this type of movie) but ignore them anyways this is a great movie about the psychological dance that we must all face in life. Only this is even more extreme in that it's about a woman pushed over the edge to succeed.  She has to deal with a overbearing mother among other things and that's never a good thing. THe blu ray looks great and Natalie deserved best actress all the way for this  movie. It's not a easy  movie to watch , nor should it be as movies about mental illness are never pleasant. Still it's worth the effort because of the story of how this dancer is consumed by her artform among other things. You must watch this with that attitude or perhaps get lost. This isn't a feel good movie but it's a intriguing one and that's well acted and it is not traditional hollywood fair in the least. Which is why those with small attention spans need look elsewhere.  Get the blu ray if you want this one.</p></body></html>

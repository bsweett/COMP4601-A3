Captain James T. Kirk and his crew are reunited on a newly modeled Enterprise and soon encounter an entity known as V'Ger which (naturally) threatens the galaxy.  The plot has bits and pieces from old Star Trek episodes, and hardcore Trekkies balked at many a moment in the film (especially those bland Starfleet uniforms, good God...), but in the end Star Trek: The Motion Picture is still a good hearted sci-fi film that went on to be a phenominal hit (and spawned numerous sequels and spin off TV series).  This Director's Edition of the film includes some extra footage which actually helps the film make more sense, and the DVD itself is one of the few DVD's worth paying Paramount's full list price for (Paramount is famous for overpricing their DVD's and including no extras whatsoever other than a trailer) and the extras will keep Trekkies (young and old) entertained for days.  All in all, if your a hardcore Trek fan, than you most likely already have this, but if you don't give it a look.</p></body></html>

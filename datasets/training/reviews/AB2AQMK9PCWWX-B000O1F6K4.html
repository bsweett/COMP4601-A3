He always does &quot;deep attitude&quot; and brooding well...Selma Hayek is great to look at, although she coulda acted less helpless here...the stylish Rodriquez  directing reminds me of John Woo's technique...and the opening 10-15  minutes--Steve Buscemi's set-up--has got to be one of the great film  beginnings of all time. One of the best action films ever made.</p></body></html>

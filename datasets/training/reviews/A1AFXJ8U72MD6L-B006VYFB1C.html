Moneyball refers to wealthier teams getting the better players and in this film we see Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill coming up with a new analysis on how to effectively use baseball players who are underrated. It's a nice ride as to how the Oakland A's had their big wins  Phillip Seymour Hoffman has a supporting roll as the A's manager. Note that this is based on a novel of a similar title by Michael Lewis. Baseball fans will enjoy this picture more than me. The Academy Awards nominated this picture for 6 awards, including Best Actor and Best Picture. CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus to B; SPORT FOCUSES/JARGON: B to B plus; OVERALL GRADE: B; WHEN WATCHED: yesterday.</p></body></html>

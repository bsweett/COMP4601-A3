<meta name="summary" content="Phew! This is completely flabbergasting"></head><body><p>Old Boy was the first Korean film I have ever seen. I must say I am completely taken aback by the concept. I've lost count of the number of times in this film when I experienced EXTREME GOOSEBUMP SYNDROME.<br /><br />I know I will never watch a film like Old Boy again but I do know it will reflect in my future conversations. I am not even ashamed of downloading this film. Atleast I watched it.<br /><br />This film is about revenge and has more suspense filled raw staggering control over the viewer than I can possibly comprehend in my little review. The story is about as unique as the design of the wonders of the world. The movie covers a lot of aspects of a man's life. What value does time have? Do we really forget everything we know? Do elevators actually have passwords for the penthouse right on top? Do men actually have a remote control controlling their life support?<br /><br />Now now, I know how vague and random I might sound but Old Boy actually did this to me. It is the most potent display of human thought I have seen in a long time. I remember watching "Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind" and being disappointed not by the story but by the frail enactment. "Old Boy" contains more thought and hardcore action than quite a few movies put together. It leaves most behind in terms of quantity of mind.<br /><br />I don't want to start with the actors and storylines because I do not want to ruin it for you.My favourite character in the film was the villain.The movie seems way ahead of it's time. At first, the subtitles didnt really help but soon I got used to it and by the end, they only helped more and more.<br /><br />Old Boy keeps becoming more interesting as it grows. When it ended, I had my hand on my mouth and my eyes just about as wide as to make me look uglier. Anyhow, watch it to feed that demon in you that wants to watch absolute trendsetting imaginative plots. Hope you know what I mean. You will.</p></body></html>

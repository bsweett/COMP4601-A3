<meta name="summary" content="Satisfying--and it is NOT mild."></head><body><p>George S. Kaufman once said, "Satire is what closes on Saturday night," and Hollywood has pretty much heeded that advice ever since. There are few political satires that come out of La-La Land, and even fewer--"Dr. Strangelove" comes to mind--that are commercially successful. This is why Jason Reitman's "Thank You for Smoking," based on the novel by Christopher Buckley, is so welcome. Particularly in today's poisonous political atmosphere, it is wonderful and refreshing to see a movie that is so clever, so witty, and so worldly-wise about America's true national sport--spin-doctoring--and how all sides play it to their advantage. Aaron Eckhart is wonderfully sleazy as Nick Naylor, a hired gun for the tobacco industry who delights in unleashing his brilliant verbiage in the service of making anti-smoking advocates look like the Gestapo. Only occasionally--such as when he's with his young son (Cameron Bright)--does Nick feel any twinges of conscience about using his talents in order to persuade people to suck poison down their lungs. But then again, Nick is positively cuddly compared with some of his adversaries, such as backstabbing reporter Heather Hathaway (Katie Holmes) and self-righteous Vermont Senator Ortolan Finistirre (William H. Macy), whose crunchy-granola politics mask the heart of a ruthless political hatchetman. "Thank You for Smoking" is stuffed with excellent comic performances, including Maria Bello and David Koechner as Nick's fellow spin doctors in the alcohol and firearms industries; J.K. Simmons as Nick's treacherous, blowhard boss; Rob Lowe and Adam Brody as a couple of flaky, motormouthed Hollywood egomaniacs; and especially the great Robert Duvall as "The Colonel," a courtly throwback to the time when Big Tobacco was King. For lovers of cinematic sarcasm, "Thank You for Smoking" is a welcome breath of smoky, mentholated, nicotine-tinged air.</p></body></html>

Strangely her death hit me pretty hard as if she were a part of my immediate circle of family and friends.<br /><br />What had Diana meant to me and to millions around the world? And why did we all take her death so personally?<br /><br />Stephan Frears' "The Queen" doesn't deal with these Diana questions much but her death is the engine that pulls this film along to its inevitable conclusion. What he does deal with is Queen Elizabeth's (a perfectly stiff-upper lipped Helen Mirren...a performance without irony and definitely one of respect) reaction, or more to the point, non-reaction to Diana's death.<br /><br />Frears, best known for edgy dramas as in the terrific "The Grifters" and "My Beautiful Launderette" directs here with restraint and reverence which in most cases would translate to stodgy and dull. But Frears, ever the consummate artist treats the material with panache, taking advantage of the political, social and emotional nature of this situation to elevate the material to drama, riveting drama<br /><br /> In 1997, Tony Blair (a dull, odd, Michael Sheen) had just been elected on a platform of change and modernism and meets with a wall that is the implacable Queen and the Royal family who are intent on adhering to tradition which meant that Diana, as no longer a member of the royal family, would not deserve a State funeral. But the English people, who loved Diana as well as People from all over the world persuaded, along with Tony Blair, Queen Elizabeth to change her mind.<br /><br />"The Queen" is very well made and generally well acted though Alex Jennings who plays Prince Charles seems to be in a constant state of indecision and confusion and who perpetually seems to be smelling poop.<br /><br />It's been 9 years since that August night in Paris but if anything Diana's fame is bigger now than ever. "The Queen" does nothing to diminish Diana's fame and of course, she will always remain young and beautiful in our eyes and memories. What "The Queen" does though is to buff up the tarnished reputation of the English Monarchy by making them as human-like as any film has ever done. And that is not an easy task to perform.</p></body></html>

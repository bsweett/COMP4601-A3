<meta name="summary" content="superbly acted drama on redemption and end of life"></head><body><p>This is an utterly rivetting film about three lives that intersect by chance.  First, there is the professor (Penn), whose health is deteriorating and whose marriage is all but a meaningless shell.  Second, there is the wife (Watts) of his heart donor, whose pain at the loss of her family has driven her to return to drug abuse.  Third, there is the ex-con who is remaking his life as a born-again christian and is lucky to be loved - he takes responsibility for a car accident that claims the lives of the wife's family.<br /><br />What makes this film so outstanding is the actors:  they are absolutely first rate and you feel what they are going thru as they question life and try to cope.  It is so utterly believable that it is very painful to watch:  you feel their conflict and the meaninglessness that threatens to engulf each of them, but also how they reach the point where the survivors can go on.  With all of their flaws and the ambiguous outcome, this is not a simplistic hollywood feel-good film where all's well that ends well.  It is brilliant art that reflects on life.  The time shifts are also quite interesting and are not hard to follow as a narrative that is not quite linear.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.</p></body></html>

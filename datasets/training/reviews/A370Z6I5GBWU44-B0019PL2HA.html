<meta name="summary" content="Hilarious spoof of NASCAR"></head><body><p>Like most of the other movies Will Ferrell is in that makes fun of various things (like the ones he did on ice-skating or being an anchorman), this is a funny twist and spoof on the chosen subject - in this instance NASCAR, the favorite sport of rednecks and white trash. His family dynamics are also entertaining to watch, like his kids cussing out Grandpa at the table, or his relationship with his best (and ex-best) friend. If you don't like Will Ferrell, you won't like this, but if you do like him and hate NASCAR, you will definitely enjoy this film.</p></body></html>

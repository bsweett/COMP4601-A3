<meta name="summary" content="Worth seeing once.."></head><body><p>This film has alot of good special effects but the dumb plot seems like an afterthought. The whole story centers around global warming triggering a new Ice Age. There are scenes where people are instantly frozen to death, tornados and hurricans flooding and tearing up cities.<br /><br />The movie fails to depict the true ramifications of such a climate upheaval: Society would end and a new "Dark Age" would ensue. Billions of people would die, not just from the weather but from starvation and the wars that would follow. The movie softballs the whole story, especially the subplot about the father who travels through the tundra on foot to rescue his son (simply ridiculous).<br /><br />Just like Independence Day, the movie works if you don't think too much.</p></body></html>

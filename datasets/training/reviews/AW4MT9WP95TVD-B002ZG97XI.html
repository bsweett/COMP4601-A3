<meta name="summary" content="One FATAL flaw - it's not funny"></head><body><p>It's not funny at all.  We sat there straight-faced throughout the whole movie waiting for something funny to happen.  Poor John Cusack must be having financial difficulties or something.  We have already laughed at all the body fluid jokes - so they are not funny anymore, just desperate.  This whole movie is desperate. Anyway, this has to be a new low in what gets marketed as a comedy these days.  Sad, sad, sad.</p></body></html>

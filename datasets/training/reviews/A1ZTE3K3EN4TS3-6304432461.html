<meta name="summary" content="Easily one of the best movies ever made!"></head><body><p>When this movie first came out, it was the one who redefined the word &quot;blockbuster&quot; for the 80's movies.  Willis was shot to stardom after this action-packed turn that allowed him to use his trademark smirk and cocky attitude to the fullest extent.  Some of the greatest action sequences on film are in this movie (including the infamous &quot;jump from the roof with a firehouse around him&quot; shot that you see in all the trailers for it).  You will watch this again and again, as all characters are fairly solid, and Rickman's villian is absolutely the most suave bad guy you'll ever see.  The second one was as good as this one, but the third in the trilogy just went too far and lost the essence of the first two.</p></body></html>

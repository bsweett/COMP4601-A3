<meta name="summary" content="Decent Sci-fi"></head><body><p>I bought this on my B-day on a whim just wanting to see some decent sci-fi, I got my copy from Target. I don't care for the cast, but do like the basic story and just enjoy the strange aspects of the plot. So it's just decent, nothing great. Scientists in a relationship, working together so synthesize a hybrid life form for scientific exploitations.</p></body></html>

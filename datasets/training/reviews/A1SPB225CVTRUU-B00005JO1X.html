<meta name="summary" content="I will watch anything that has Tilda Swinton in it."></head><body><p>I am not a huge fan of children's fantasy movies. I didn't even care to watch anymore Harry Potter after the first two. I did enjoyed Narnia, because it's a visually stunning film and it's got great action and special effects all over. I am a huge fan of Tilda Swinton and have seen most of her stuff since Orlando, but her best work is still The Deep End. I love her icy mysterious looks, very glamorous and powerful. Her porcelain dool face is perfect to play the witch, and she's proven to be a very versatile actress. I also enjoyed the limited participation of Jim Broadbent, who's probably the most overexposed British actor these days, but he's an amazing actor, and I also loved him Art School Confidential. I can't believe enjoyed a children's film.</p></body></html>

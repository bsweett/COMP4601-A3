That said, I enjoyed "Master and Commander" immensely.  I thought that director Peter Weir captured the claustrophobia of being aboard a warship circa 1800 and the feeling of being embattled at sea.  The construction of the ships, from every creaking plank and rusting nail, is flawless.  The sound and cinematography here is superb.  As far as the story, it's slow going at first but as the film progresses and the characters become more fleshed out it picks up momentum.  As far as the performances, what can you say about Russell Crowe, probably one of the most versatile actors working today.  He can add another memorable character in Jack Aubrey, the cocksure and determined captain of the H.M.S. Surprise.  He is equalled by Paul Bettany, the ship's surgeon and naturalist, Stephen Maturon.  These two are as much confidantes as adversaries.  Whereas Aubrey obsesses over attacking a state of the art French ship, the Acheron, Maturon lobbies Aubrey about taking a more cautious approach.  One could almost draw an obvious parallel in modern pop culture(dare I say it? Kirk and McCoy).  Anybody looking for a well told story that takes it's time this is the film for you.</p></body></html>

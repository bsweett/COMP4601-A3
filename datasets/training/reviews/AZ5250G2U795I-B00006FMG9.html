<meta name="summary" content="'Manhunter' ruined this film for me."></head><body><p>Red Dragon is actually a remake of the 80's Michael Mann version of this story.  So I had the characters already set as to my expectations, and Manhunter did a beautiful job with the story to begin with.  I'm sure that is what hurt this film for me.  It certainly wasn't the casting or the story.  This version was a little more 'splashy' than the gritty nature of Manhunter, and the grit I think helped the original movie more than this did.<p>Fiennes was a surprising Dollarhyde.  He is truly one of the most gifted screen actors we have.  Hopkins is too identified with Lector to not like him, even though his part is scant.  Even Norton, who can't seem to fail at a part, gives Will Graham a vulnerability much different than William Peterson's original.<p>I think the casting gives you most of an expecation for a 'bigger' film, which this story can't be.  I just felt that the casting and manner the story was told in Manhunter 'fit' better than this one.</p></body></html>

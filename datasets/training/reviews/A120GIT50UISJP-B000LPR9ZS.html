<meta name="summary" content="Better than the second Saw, but still doesn't rise to the original."></head><body><p>Picking up minutes after the end of Saw II, Jigsaw [Tobin Bell] is very near the end of his life. With the help of Amanda [Shawnee Smith], he kidnaps a doctor [Bahar Soomekh] who must choose between keeping Jigsaw alive until another victim can play his game, or death. The other victim, Jeff [Angus MacFadyen], is promised that he will meet the person responsible for the loss of his child if he can pass a series of tests. The two victims, doctor and father, play their games while an agitated Amanda tries to keep her temper and jealousy under control and prevent herself from offing the doctor herself. Although this Saw movie is more satisfying than the second, with a twist ending that is significantly different than the last two, it is still a puzzle thriller, not rising to the level of the truly horrifying original.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Potential to be a new Christmas movie classic!"></head><body><p>Based on the book of the same name by Chris Van Allsburg, it's something of a mystery why The Polar Express did not connect with audiences when it was released in theatres last year. Perhaps people weren't ready to accept that kind of animation yet - at least not until it looks a bit more realistic. Regardless, Robert Zemeckis' film certainly has all the right ingredients for a classic children's Christmas movie: a timeless message, dazzling visuals, exciting action sequences and universal characters that anyone can relate to.<br /><br />The film contains some of the most impressive computer animation this side of Pixar except that it is not done in a caricature style but rendered as realistically as possible, much like Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. However, despite the state-of-the-art CGI, the facial expressions of the characters aren't quite as fully or realistically animated as in hand-drawn animation. They aren't able to accurately render wrinkles on a person's face. They still look too smooth and waxy with the hair looking rather plastic-like. However, the rendering of shadows and light, like a shot of the train stopped by the side of the road, the warm light of its interiors casting shadows on the snow covered ground while flakes of snow fall gently from the sky, looks very impressive indeed. Each scene is elaborately rendered with so much detail that you could pause any frame and spend a good amount of time marveling at all the work that went into this movie.<br /><br />The first disc features a theatrical trailer.<br /><br />The second disc starts off with "You Look Familiar," a featurette on the many faces of Tom Hanks. He ended up playing five different characters and worked entirely on blue screen sets while wearing a motion capture suit and very little props or other actors to interact with.<br /><br />"A Genuine Ticket to Ride" explores, briefly, the source material and how the filmmakers were able to adapt it through digital technology known as performance capture. This featurette takes us through the technical aspects of the filmmaking process in easy to understand terms.<br /><br />"The Inspirations: An Author's Adventure" takes a look at author Chris Van Allsburg. He got his start as a sculptor but moved on to drawings when it became too expensive to buy supplies.<br /><br />"Josh Groban at the Greek" is a music video of the singer performing "Believe" at the famous venue interspersed with clips from the movie.<br /><br />"Behind the Scenes of `Believe'" takes a look at how the song came together and what it meant to those involved - clearly it was a labour of love.<br /><br />"Polar Express Challenge" is a game that has you steer the train across the frozen lake to safety and then you have to help Santa deliver presents to deserving children and coal to the bad ones.<br /><br />"Meet the Snow Angels" features key cast and crew members talking about their warmest memories of Christmas and the best gift they ever got.<br /><br />Finally, there is an "Additional Song", a deleted scene between Smokey and Steamer that was actor Michael Jeter's last musical performance before he died.</p></body></html>

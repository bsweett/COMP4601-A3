<meta name="summary" content="no illusions here-- it's bad"></head><body><p>There is so much wrong with the Illusionist I have to start with the two things that are right: first, Paul Giamatti. He does a great job and frankly the only time the movie comes alive is when he's on screen. Second, the character actor playing Crown Prince Leopold's valet. He expresses anguish, shame and shock using nothing but body language and his eyes. Very good. The guy playing Leopold was fairly interesting and can look back on his role here without shame.<br /><br />Now, what's wrong? Edward Norton, sure he's a great actor but not in this flick. He spends the entire movie looking like he's got hemorrhoids. The flat voice, the stiff ooh don't make the itch and burn start up again walk, the dead eyed stare--- none of that looked like a man in love and there were times when I was laughing at him. Plus his accent weaved in and out worse than Kevin Costner as Robin Hood. Sometimes he sounded like an Austrian and sometimes he sounded like a dude from Idaho.<br /><br />Jessica Biel is a pretty girl and she really has nothing to do but look lovely in her role but she can't even do that. She seemed like an android. She walked and talked but was completely souless. Her version of Sophie wouldn't turn most men's heads for more than a night, the audience is asked to believe that this bland, stilted creature somehow held a man's heart for 15 years. Nah.<br /><br />Finally, the big reveal at the end made no darn sense. It was impossible. No good detective would've been fooled, the Romeo and Juliet potion was a cheap trick.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Aims high; mostly succeeds"></head><body><p>I've never seen the TV series that this movie spawned; this is a review of the movie on its own terms.<p>This movie is _so_ close to being great that it's frustrating not to be able to award it five stars. Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin had a terrific idea here and _almost_ sustained it for the length of a feature film.<p>The essential idea owes a lot to Robert A. Heinlein's _Tunnel in the Sky_ (and some of the plot details show debts to other Heinlein works as well). There's this stargate, see . . .<p>Well, that's enough about the plot, just in case you haven't seen it yet. For SF geeks like me, the first hour and a half is like a wet-dream come true. The ending doesn't exactly fall apart or anything, it's just that it doesn't manage to remain at the high level of the first two-thirds of the movie.<p>As Col. Jack O'Neil, Kurt Russell is terrific as usual (and I happen to think he deserves far more credit as an actor than he's generally gotten). James Spader is a bit hammy but generally credible as Daniel Jackson, the absent-minded academic-outcast astro-Egyptologist dweeb. In lesser hands these two characters could have devolved into cliches, but these actors manage to keep them alive. Of course there's also Jaye Davidson, the special secret surprise from _The Crying Game_, here used very effectively in a role I can't say anything about without spoiling the plot.<p>David Arnold's soaring score is just awesome. You'll want to plug your DVD player into your sound system for this one (if you don't have it there already).<p>And the plot is intellectually engaging for at least most of the way through. The, um, foreign culture in question is nicely evoked and fleshed out, with a few cinematic nods to everything from _Dune_ to Indiana Jones to _The Man Who Would Be King_, and without too many of the oversimplifications that always threaten films of this sort.<p>I have no idea at all how well the TV series has done in sustaining this stuff. But the movie stands quite well on its own.<p>The _Ultimate_ DVD set includes both a 'director's cut' and the original theaterical-release version -- plus some nice commentaries and interviews. The interviewees include (who else?) Erich von Daniken, whose _Chariots of the Gods?_ was part of the popular literature of my youth. If you've even heard of him, you'll probably like this movie.</p></body></html>

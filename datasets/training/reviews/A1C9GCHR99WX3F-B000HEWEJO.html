George Bailey starts life as happy boy turning itno man, and was around to save to save his 8 years old brother from drowing but then causing him to lose hearing in one ear. As a 12 year old he works in a drug store for kind of a gumpy man (H.B. Warner). The movie starts with some people in a town called Bedfordfalls praying to god to help George Bailey (James Stewart). Which leads us to see a couple of talking things that are supposed to be god and angles (and angles in training). Then we got a flashback of George's life as a 12 years old boy in 1919. When he saves his brother Harry. Then we see him becoming a man who knows what he wants to do tommrrow, the next day and the next year, he wants to leave the little town and see the world. Which he learn from when he tells that his girlfriend Mary Hatch (Donna Reed). After he breaks a window at this big house.</p></body></html>

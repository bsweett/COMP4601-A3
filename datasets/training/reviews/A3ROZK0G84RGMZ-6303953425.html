<meta name="summary" content="Great Collector's Edition.  You Can A Steak Here Daddy-O"></head><body><p>I never get tired of this movie.  I don't think I ever will.  It is so original.  This Quentin Tarantino classic has become the blue print for so many other movies out there.  Even though they try they can never come close to this masterpiece.  This collector's edition is great.  Many bonus features and anamorphic widescreen.  I wish more movie directors and studios would take the time to make actual great collector's editions like these folks did.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Elizabeth: The Golden Age"></head><body><p>`Elizabeth: The Golden Age' is the perfect example of history as entertainment and although the authenticity of the history may take second place to the entertainment, this still makes for engrossing viewing. Following Queen Elizabeth in her middle years this films explores the romance of Sir Walter Raleigh, the Catholic assassination plots, Mary Queen of Scots treason and the Spanish Armada. The costumes and sets are stunning and are the key aspects that really makes this film. Blanchett's performance is as good as the first film (which you don't have to have seen to enjoy this film) and the supporting cast do an ample job at providing the drama and intrigue to the storylines. Clive Owen is especially good as the lovable rogue, Raleigh, and is very credible after seeing him in less impressive roles in other films. The veracity of the history may be in doubt, but the adventure and drama in the story more than make up for this and as long as you are aware of it, this film makes for a couple of hours of good viewing. Worth a try if you enjoyed the first instalment.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

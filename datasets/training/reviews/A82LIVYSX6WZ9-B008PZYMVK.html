Spike Jonze is the man and by far a great up and coming director/actor(he was in Three Kings with George Clooney and later in 2002 he made Adaptation with Nicolas Cage). Cusack is great as Schwartz, the man who finds out theres a door leading into Malkovich's brain. Diaz is crazy as Cusack's pet obsessed wife who wants Malkovich's body to have sex with Catherine Keener's charcter. There's a lot of great moments including when John Malkovich goes inside his owen brain. loved it a lot</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Did it really have to be this bad ?"></head><body><p>I saw the play in London several years ago and even though it didn't strike me back then as a work of art, compared to this movie it sure felt like it. While I appreciate Streep's charisma in a part which really doesn't play to her incredible dramatic skills, everybody else in the cast gave me the feeling I was watching an improvised high school play done by people with very little talent. I was always a fan of Brosnan's James Bond but his musical talents are no more than mediocre, specially while singing (that may be too strong a word) SOS and just standing there with not much to do but stare at Meryl, during her interpretation of THE WINNER TAKES IT ALL. I also found odd they would choose such an weird looking girl in the lead (with eyes just like a frog). I guess it didn't feel to surprising that with so many people dancing near the water, a bunch of them would "accidentaly" fall in it and it's not like I was expecting CASABLANCA but the only fun I had in watching MAMMA MIA was laughing at its awfulness.<br />Strictly for people who love to make hores-cabooses of themeselves on dance floors.</p></body></html>

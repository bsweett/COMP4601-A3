The cultural psyche still is still reeling from its arrival on the scene over thirty years ago.  It is a masterpiece that will continue to endure long after many horror films of today are forgotten.<br /><br />Actress Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) seeks the aid of Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller) after her daughter Regan (Linda Blair) starts to behave oddly.  Upon the realization that something is horribly wrong with the young girl, Father Lankester Merrin (Max von Sydow) is summoned to conduct an exorcism on her.  A terrifying battle between the forces of good and evil then ensues that pushes all involved to their physical and spiritual breaking points.<br /><br />Words cannot effectively convey the power of "The Exorcist."  This is a film that relentlessly assaults the senses and makes no apologies for doing so.  Genre entries that followed it had no choice but to follow its lead because it single-handedly redefined what the public understood to be cinematic horror.  While Linda Blair deservedly receives much of the attention for her fine work, the equally powerful performance by Jason Miller as Father Karras should not be overlooked.  He gives the film an important human component that keeps it grounded.  Without Karras' arc, "The Exorcist" is just another scream-flick trying to make a quick buck by relying on cheap thrills.  Truly groundbreaking, "The Exorcist" is a stunning work that dared to test the limits of filmmaking.  No serious discussion of great cinema is complete without a mention of it.</p></body></html>

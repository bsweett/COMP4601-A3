<meta name="summary" content="Gives Viewer's What They Want and Expect from MI"></head><body><p>Profound analysis of the relationship between diplomacy and (military) strategy, between overt and covert activity, between the American Way and Some Foreign Ways of Protecting Themselves have to be  left at the door to enjoy this film. Since this is the third in the series, most viewers apprehend that fact and sit down to enjoy what they DID come to see: Spectacular Action, lots of stunts and stirring feats of daring, on  the one hand, and, spectacular nastiness from the Bad Guys. This film provides a full measure of WHAM and BANG, possibly better than its two predecessors. It also provides a neat way of getting rid of enemies, the fatal headache. There is more than a bit of suspense as we know from the beginning that the heroes wife has been snatched to serve as Ransom for what some of the Evil Doers want from the Hero. I must admit I did not keep straight the double triple crosses, the deviousness of Government, and all that stuff, Possibly it will have some significance to you. My attitude, pretty well acted upon in this film, is to take about a minute or two, no more, in a part of the film where a rest is called for, to have someone spout a few, hopefully, unintelligible words summarizing the "ideas" in the film, before moving on to the next bang bang. That they do here. Tom Cruise (and his stuntmen) do a fine job, as they usually do in these films; in addition, while I can't be certain, I should think he is still one solid Hunk for the Women. Naturally, there is always something for the men to look at as well. The rest of the cast does well in the relatively brief parts of the scene when the stunts are not being performed.<br />If you liked the others in this series, this one should appear to you a worthy successor to the first two.</p></body></html>

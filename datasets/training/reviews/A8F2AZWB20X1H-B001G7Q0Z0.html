<meta name="summary" content="One of the all-time sci-fi champs"></head><body><p>"Planet of the Apes" was a watershed film in the sci-fi genre; before this movie, sci-fi was all about Martians, two-headed space invaders, and monsters caused by nuclear fallout.  Charlton Heston is not one of my favorite actors; he's too heavy-handed as a rule, but he was never better than in the role of Taylor, the astronaut who is returning home from space with two crew members (a third dies en route) and finds that they have landed on what looks like a totally alien planet.  The few humans they run into look as though they have reverted back to a stone-age existence, but what really blows him away is when he finds that the apes have taken over the planet and have placed the humans in servitude.  How does it feel to be treated like an animal for a change?  The ape society is riven with dissensions as the more liberal-minded simians and the soldier apes clash over how their captives are to be treated; and Taylor eventually escapes... but to what?  The mind-blowing scene where Taylor discovers the rust-eaten remains of the Statue of Liberty and realizes he's been home all along is one of the classics in film-making; it's pure Rod Serling, right out of the twilight zone, and it still wows us after all these decades.  The POTA spinoffs went downhill from the first film; the sequels were uniformly awful, but the original is still the champ.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Special Edition treatment that this film deserves."></head><body><p>After the commercial and critical success of The Last of the Mohicans, filmmaker Michael Mann made his most ambitious film up to that point in his career with Heat. He cast legendary actors Robert De Niro and Al Pacino as the leads in what would be their first the on-screen appearance together in a movie (they were in The Godfather: Part II but never appeared in the same scene). Mann returned to a 1986 draft of a screenplay that originated before he made The Jericho Mile. A few years ago, Warner Brothers released a bare bones DVD of Heat. To celebrate the 10th anniversary, Mann has revisited his movie and assembled an excellent collection of extras.<br /><br />Mann contributes a characteristically solid audio commentary. He provides a lot of details into the backgrounds and motivations of the film's characters. Surprisingly, there is very little overlap from the featurettes as Mann's comments start off strong but become more infrequent after the 90 minute mark.<br /><br />The strongest extra is "The Making of Heat," an excellent 54-minute retrospective documentary that can be viewed in three separate featurettes or altogether. Many of the major and minor cast members are back for brand new interviews and offer insightful comments, including Al Pacino, Jon Voight, Ashley Judd, Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore amongst others. This is in-depth look at how Heat was put together and provides the whole story for casual fans and fascinating insight for devotees.<br /><br />"Pacino and De Niro: The Conversation" explores the famous on-screen meeting between these two actors. Mann subverts our expectations by delaying their eventual meeting and then, when it does happen, it is at a diner over coffee and not what one expects with this kind of a movie.<br /><br />"Return to the Scene of the Crime" features location manager Janice Polley revisiting many of the locations used in the movie. Mann wanted to find locations in Los Angeles that had never been put on film before in order to create a distinctive look.<br /><br />Finally, there are 11 deleted scenes that include the most revealing excised bit of footage in a scene where McCauley and his crew get ready just before they enter the bank while one of his gang is interrogated by rogue psycho, Waingro that should have been kept in. There is nothing terribly earth-shattering about this excised footage but there are a couple of good moments.<br /><br />The scale and star power of Heat was unlike anything Mann had ever tried before and firmly announced him as force to be reckoned within Hollywood. This two-DVD set is a fitting tribute for this important film. The transfer and sound are very well done with extras that are substantial and plentiful, providing a really good look at how this epic movie was put together.</p></body></html>

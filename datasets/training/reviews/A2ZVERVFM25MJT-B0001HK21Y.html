<meta name="summary" content="Yes it's better than Hannibal....but that wasn't too hard"></head><body><p>Anticipation for Red Dragon was huge following the success of Silence Of The Lambs, although anticipation to slate it was also there with the mis-step that was Hannibal.  However, by assembling the kind of impressive cast that would seem to be more at home in a Tarantino or PT Anderson picture, people were prepared to give it a chance.  Based on Thomas Harris' book of the same name that wipes over previous adaptation Manhunter with a much more glossy reinterpretation of Lecter's capture and the man behind it, Will Graham.<p>That's it for story really, with the old 'cop coming out of retirement for one last job' trick being pulled again.  Edward Norton, actor of a generation to anyone who's seen his performances in American History X, Fight Club or Primal Fear, is handed a dull part in Will Graham.  Whereas the novel and first adaptation Manhunter focused much more on this character, describing how the job was slowly destroying him, Red Dragon's script barely allows for such character development.  Norton does the best with the slight material handed to him, as does Harvey Keitel, but unfortunately (and for the first time ever) both fail to make much of an impression.  Anthony Hopkins has appropriately toned down his over-the-top performance from Hannibal here, and thankfully directot Brett Ratner chooses not to overuse the character as was the case in the latter.  Still, though his performance is good, you can't help but look at his scenes with Norton alongside those he shared with Foster and the chemistry just isn't there.  Despite these set of almost disappointing appearances though Ralph Fiennes and Emily Watson are wonderful.  Perhaps surprisingly given how well he's fared in epics such as The English Patient and Sunshine, in a supporting role Fiennes makes one of his most indelible impressions as The Tooth Fairy, the mass-murderer who uses Hannibal Lecter as his template.  Emily Watson also proves that she is amazingly versatile as the blind woman who Fiennes' character pursues in what turns out to be the best plotline the story has to offer.  Their nervous partnership is genuinely interesting and much better than the, albeit limited, blood and gore scenes.<p>The main problem that most critics seem to have had with Red Dragon is that it doesn't live up to Manhunter.  Whilst it's true that Manhunter is definitely the more intelligent effort, with Red Dragon reeking of a cash-in.  In addition, the almost grainy camera work is fooling no-one that this is a serious crime picture - it isn't.  Even so, it's all perfectly enjoyable whilst it's on screen, and whilst it might not be clever, insightful or as long-lasting as Silence Of The Lambs, it was definitely one of the more enjoyable blockbusters of last year and is by no means a shame to the Hannibal canon.</p></body></html>

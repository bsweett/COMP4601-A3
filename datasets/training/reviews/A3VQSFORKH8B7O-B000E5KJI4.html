<meta name="summary" content=""TROY:" NO GIFT FROM THE GODS!"></head><body><p>According to Homer's "The Illiad" (which may or may not have been based on an actual event), the love between Trojan prince Paris and Helen of Troy caused the great city of Troy to fall. Similarly, Wolfgang Petersen's epic "Troy" nearly falls itself.<br /><br />The storytelling is fairly weak. The set-up for the tale goes by too fast, and little time is spent on really getting to know many of the characters of the film. The battle sequences are big and well-crafted with fantastic choreography and breathtaking CG effects, but they lack both the excitement and emotion that were clearly evident in Oliver Stone's superb epic "Alexander."<br /><br />The casting is also a problem. Like most other people, I agree that Brad Pitt was miscast as Achilles. I've never liked Pitt as an actor, and the character is portrayed more as an anti-hero. Brian Cox does not make Agememnon a convincing leader, or villain for that matter. Orlando Bloom seems to still be channeling Will Turner from "Pirates of the Caribbean" in his portrayal of Paris.<br /><br />However, there are some great performances. Eric Bana is great as Hector. I rooted for him in the one-on-one battle with Achilles, even though I knew what the outcome would be. Peter O'Toole is great at giving Trojan King Priam a Shakespearean feel. Sean Bean is great as Odysseus. If they ever do "The Odyssey," he should be approached to do so. It is these performances that make the 162-minute film bearable.<br /><br />Overall, the film is mostly a letdown. It has some good moments in terms of acting and battle, but I recommend "Alexander" as the best "Sword and Sandals" epic of 2004. As for "Troy," it's best to be viewed once, and that is all.<br /><br />Movie/DVD Grade: C+</p></body></html>

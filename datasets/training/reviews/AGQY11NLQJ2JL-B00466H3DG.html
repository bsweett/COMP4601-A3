<meta name="summary" content="External Sunshine of the Spotless Mind: A thoughtful romantic story or a dark precautionary tale"></head><body><p>What an intriguing idea for a story, a man and woman meet, fall in love, fall out of love, have their memories of the whole love experience erased from their memories by a reverse brain mapping process.  Who among us would not jump at the possibility of erasing painful or unpleasant memories and then be able move on with our lives with no recollection of anything associated with the person we had wiped from our memory.<br /><br />The lead characters in the story Joel and Clementine meet and fall and love, but after a period of few years they have drifted apart.  Clementine discovers a doctor, who offers a service where he can erase memories of a particular person from your mind.  Part of the process of forgetting is remembering.  In order to map all the areas of the brain where the memories reside; the person wanting to forget has to collect all items associated with the person they are trying to forget.  These items are shown to the individual, who is trying to forget and as they view the object a map of brain's reaction to the stimulus is created.  Through the marvel of modern science this brain map is then used to execute a pinpoint destruction of the memories.  Clementine successfully undergoes this procedure and completely erases any memories of Joel.  Presumably, she is now free of the pain of a failed relationship.  Joel is now a complete stranger to Clementine.<br /><br />Later, Joel is told by a friend that Clementine has had all memories of him erased and he becomes interested in doing the same with his memories of Clementine.  We are then treated to the spectacle of Joel having all memories of Clementine zapped.  The erasing is done while Joel is sleeping and the "technicians" drink, party and mess around during the process, in a startling display of indifference to what is being done to this person.  Perhaps this is an indictment against the medical community that treats our mental anguish and discomfort with drugs or other means with a sort of detachment from what other damage may be inflicted on the individual.<br /><br />As we watch Joel's memories disappearing, through the use of clever cinematographic techniques, we see that Joel is desperately trying to keep the memories that are being removed.  Other memories from his childhood become more vivid and we can clearly see that all his memories work together to create the person that is Joel.  That is, I think, the precautionary tale of this film.  We can not as humans selectively erase bad or painful memories from our minds without having an impact on our overall psyche.  We may lose some pain, but we may also give up a piece of our soul or our being when we try to block out the bad and keep only the good.  Our memories are complex and twisted and tied together in ways we do not fully comprehend, so be careful when you hit the erase button and enjoy the movie it will create its own map</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Saw II - Where did he get all those needles?"></head><body><p>After consecutively watching the entire Saw series over a recent weekend (and LOVING it), I decided that a single review with modified details could be used for all the films.  Enjoy.<br /><br />A sadistic sociopath, similar to the one in Se7en, with an affinity for engineering, likes to play lethal games, forcing his victims - those he deems unappreciative of life - into an existential choice inside a million dollars worth of engineering and machinery.<br /><br />Saw TWO begins with EIGHT people trapped in an abandoned NERVE GAS HOUSE.  Forced to play the killer's (Tobin Bell as John "Jigsaw" Kramer) game, XAVIER CHAVEZ (Frankie G.), GUS COLYARD (Tony Nappo), and OBI TATE (Tim Burd), among others, have to prove their will to live, and their ability to COOPERATE.  Meanwhile, DET. ALLISON KERRY (Dina Meyer), OFFICER DANIEL RIGG (Lyriq Bent), and rugged veteran DET. ERIC MATTHEWS (Donnie Wahlberg) are investigating as a team, but ERIC MATTHEWS may be in too deep.  As the law grows increasingly closer to ensnaring Jigsaw, the game participants learn that OBI may be an accomplice to their abduction, and their situation provides a choice between VARIOUS TRAPS or guaranteed death.  To help their cause, cryptic clues left via mini cassette tape lead the captives (aka life's perpetrators) towards the precipice of twisted rehabilitation or a potential tomb.<br /><br />Several murderous contraptions like the MAGNUM EYE HOLE (for a MONEY LAUNDERER), the FURNACE TRAP (for a CONMAN), and the NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK (for a DRUG DEALER who tosses in a JUNKIE) provide horror fodder in the form of viscera and blood spatter, while other traps - like the opening scene VENUS FLY TRAP - are inserted for the same reason Spock and Kirk always took ensign Jones on away parties (someone in the situation needs to die horribly).  Climax and cliffhanger are in quick succession, flashbacks provide necessary details, the viewer learns more about JIGSAW'S ACCOMPLICES, and on to Saw III.<br /><br />Jason Elin</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Damon continues to pull away from Affleck"></head><body><p>The story of 'The Bourne Identity' for me is Matt Damon's complete believability as title character Jason Bourne.  I didn't doubt for a second his 'fit' as a top-notch secret agent, capable of all manner of physical confrontation and quick-witted mental acuity.  He also sold me on the all-important case of 'amnesia' that drives the film.<p>I also thought Damon was eye-openingly good in 'The Talented Mr. Ripley,' especially given it was essentially the polar opposite of the celebrated South Boston poster boy he portrayed so perfectly in 'Good Will Hunting.'<p>Then, I try to imagine buddy Ben Affleck in each of these roles.  Laughable.  Keep your distance, Matt.  Smart career move.<p>The other story here is the continued maturation of director Dougie Liman.  [Son of late legal titan Arthur Liman, he of the famous unruly combover...and unlikely star of the Oliver North hearings.]  Liman takes a huge step here.  His previous films were 'Go' and 'Swingers.'  Nice *little* pictures, but Dougie has obviously been called up to the majors.  He hits a bases-clearing double in his first at-bat.</p></body></html>

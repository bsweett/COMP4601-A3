<meta name="summary" content="New 2-disc Deluxe Edition due out on July 8th, 2008"></head><body><p>There was already a 2-disc "Ultimate" Edition of The Mummy back in 2001, but it's no longer available.  The upcoming release of The Mummy: Tomb Of The Dragon Emperor has prompted Universal to release a new edition of The Mummy with the major special features from the Ultimate Edition plus a few new ones.  It will be only in widescreen (the Ultimate Edition had both wide and full).<br /><br />The Mummy is a peculiar movie, an Indiana Jonesish adventure originally intended as a low-budget remake of a 1932 horror film called The Mummy (also being released in a new <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018BD9F8">Special Edition</a>) that got spun in several directions before Brendan Fraser and huge special effects were settled on.  Fraser plays an adventurer with the French Foreign Legion in 1920s Egypt who gets into serious trouble with, among other beings, a mummy (sort of) with terrible powers.  Rachel Weisz plays the beautiful Egyptologist who both causes trouble and solves it.  Fraser isn't ideally suited to a Harrison Ford-type role, his natural center of gravity tending more to the comic, but it's hard not to like him.  The movie is less scary than just fun, if you don't insist on everything making sense.<br /><br />Here are the new special features:<br /><br />-- "An Army To Rule The World Part 1" featurette<br />-- "Unraveling The Legacy Of The Mummy" featurette<br />-- a digital copy of the movie<br />-- a sneak peak at The Mummy: Tomb Of The Dragon Emperor<br /><br />These are the features taken from the Ultimate Edition:<br /><br />-- three audio commentaries:<br />. . . director Stephen Sommers and editor Bob Ducsay<br />. . . star Brendan Fraser<br />. . . actors Oded Fehr, Kevin J.

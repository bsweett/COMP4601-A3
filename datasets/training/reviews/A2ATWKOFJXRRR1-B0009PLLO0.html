I was seriously hesitant to watch this sucker at all, considering how it got lambasted by the critics and many, many others.<br /><br />So the big question on your mind is "Was it really that bad?"<br /><br />Yes ...and no. Sorry. I'm not trying to cut hairs by saying "define sex", as Bill Clinton would. I'm just trying to say that there were definitely some excellent qualities in this film that made it watchable.<br /><br />But there were also some serious downers that made it painful, too.<br /><br />For me, I didn't have a problem with the acting nor the actors. I thought all of them (yes, even Jolie with her faux-whatever-accent) gave a fine performance. I love Val Kilmer as an actor, and I wasn't disappointed by his portrayal of Phillip, the father of Alexander.<br /><br />Anthony Hopkins, as always, was fine as the aging Ptolemy who gives us his narrative take of Alexander throughout the film.<br /><br />The battle scenes were well done, too. You may have heard about "The Elephant Battle", and how great it was. Well it is. This alone may well be worth the price of renting the film.<br /><br />In true Oliver Stone fashion, we also get the colorful scenes of death and destruction, never holding back (ala Platoon, 1986).<br /><br />Where the movie falters is in its execution and screenplay. The storyline jumps us back and forth and back and forth and back and forth in time, trying to make sense of why Alexander is the way he is. This was terribly irritating and, sometimes, confusing.<br /><br />"Are we in 329 A.D. again?"<br /><br />"No."<br /><br />"Oh."<br /><br />But the film is not as bad as the critics would have you believe. And the Greeks (the current Greeks) just need to shut up about the "gay" scenes and eat a few more olives. It was common for men to take other men as lovers. Twas no big deal. And it's not like this film showed two men pumping away at each other. There were only three hugs, two sets of tears, a few words of affection, and one simple kiss. Whoopty-Doo.<br /><br />I do feel that the problem with the movie is that Stone tried to cover too much information in one short film (although 3 hours might not seem that short to some). But when you try to capture all of the essence of one man who changed the course of history in one, quick stroke, I think you're bound to fail. This thing should've been a miniseries, about 6-12 hours in length, in order to keep the story flow moving forward without the confusing and constant flashbacks.<br /><br />So is it worth your time? I think so. It's not Stone's best film, but it's definitely entertaining.</p></body></html>

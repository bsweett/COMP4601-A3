<meta name="summary" content="An amazing and action packed experimental film"></head><body><p>Run Lola Run is the result of a great experiment in film. Despite little characterization, scattered dialogue and a very basic plot, it fully succeeds in its intentions.<p>The simplistic plot concerns Lola receiving a phone call from her boyfriend Mannie, who has 20 minutes to come up with 100,000 deutsch marks or faith the wrath of a crime boss. Lola sets off to find a way to come up with the money before Mannie resorts to robbery. That's it. But the trick of the film lies in the retelling of those 20 minutes in three separate scenarios as Lola is given multiple chances to get things right.<p>But the filmmakers don't need a second chance to get this film right. The pulsating techno soundtrack perfectly connects with the beautiful images of Lola running, trying to beat destiny. There's just something about the urgency in her eyes and the gracefulness with which she runs that won't let you take your eyes away from her. The film also explores how extremely minor events, such as brushing against someone, can have profound impacts on the rest of a person's life.<p>There's really not a whole lot more I can say about Run Lola Run. It's just a very small, short film (an 80 minute running time) that perfectly captures its subject. This one is definitely recommended, even for those that normally may avoid foreign language films. You just can't miss out on it.</p></body></html>

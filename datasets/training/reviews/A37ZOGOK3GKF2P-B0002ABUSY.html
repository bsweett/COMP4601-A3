<meta name="summary" content="Dawn Redux Has Bite"></head><body><p>Growing up as a kid, I had to sneak in to see Romero's Cult Fave "Dawn of the Dead."  For the first time in junior high I was actually cool because I saw the film.  It was a savage blend of action, gore, and satire.  It remained my favorite horror film for many years.  I didn't think it could be improved, but I was so wrong.  Zack Snyder's version is a frenzy of action and gore galore.  This film moves at a great pace.  The Director's Cut features extra gore, and some talkie scenes that I can see why they were cut.  Good, solid acting and breathtaking camera work makes this 'Dawn' stand out on it's own.</p></body></html>

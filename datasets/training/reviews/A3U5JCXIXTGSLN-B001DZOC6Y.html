The Happening, however, was one of the dumbest films I've watched in a very long time! The Happening is the latest film by M. Night Shyamalan in which people mysteriously stop dead in their tracks and begin killing themselves for no apparent reason. The premise itself was kind of scary, but the other storylines and the obvious overacting by Wahlberg and Zooey Deschanel grated my nerves. You always expect people to do stupid things in horror movies, but this lot acted like they had lost all sense completely.<br /><br />The only things that made this movie tense were the cringe-worthy death scenes (Shyamalan made sure to point out that this is his first rated R film) and the stupidity and loss of common sense shared by the characters. Obviously fear causes people to do strange things, but after a while I just didn't care anymore.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg should stick what he does best - playing characters out for revenge. His take as a high school science teacher was horrible. The scene at the beginning of the movie where he is in class trying to explain the (true) disappearance of thousands of honey bees recently made me want to scream. For some reason Wahlberg talks to his students, who are at least 15 years of age or older, in a high-pitched patronizing tone. While I would have loved to have had a science teacher like him when I was in high school, the way he talked to his students was extremely annoying. I'm not even going to go into the bad performance by Zooey Deschanel, who plays Wahlberg's wife. I haven't seen much from her, but if I had to go by this performance, I'd tell her to find another career.<br /><br />So, in closing, do not see this movie. It's not worth your time and I don't think you'll enjoy it very much. I'm glad I only paid $1 to rent it at one of those Red Box kiosks in the grocery store. :)</p></body></html>

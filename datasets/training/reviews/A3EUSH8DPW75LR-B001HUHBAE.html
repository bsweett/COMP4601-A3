<meta name="summary" content="Review of the blu ray 2 disc edition"></head><body><p>Wow.  The blu ray presentation of ZODIAC is absolutely spectacular and everything that was great about this film is exemplified 100% as blu ray is used to its fullest effect.  This film has always been a 5 star outing for me.  It takes a new approach to true crime and instead follows the lengthy journey of police and reporters as they follow the leads and try to find the mysterious Zodiac killer.  The ensemble cast is exemplary with all doing some of their best work.  Some of the killings are shown and they are done without over the top gore.  Instead they are realistically shot which instills an even greater fear into the viewer.  When the killer approaches a couple and the woman exclaims "He has a gun !!" my insides quiver as if it was happening to me.<br /><br />The film manages to follow the history of the Zodiac's killings while being a police procedural and investigative piece all at the same time.  The viewer feels how each characters life is involved with and changed by this case.  There is trepidation, suspense and great drama with a superb script and amazing directing.<br /><br />Now, back to the blu ray version of this film.  This is a brand new release and I needed an update on my blu ray player to view it.  Very easy to do.  And the 1080 high def pic is striking.  The visual clarity is amazing and darks, brights, etc. are all excellent.  Day and night scenes are both just as vibrant.  And the 5.1 Dolby TrueHD audio is amazing.  This seems to be a film basically dialogue driven but all 5 speakers are put to amazing use here.  The dialogue is totally crisp and this film also possesses an amazing score of 70s music. It comes from all the speakers as does city background noise.  All 5 speakers are continuously in use.  It is as if viewing the film for the 1st time and I was in awe.  This audion track makes the film a new experience.<br /><br />And for me this 2 disc Director's cut is the first blu ray to take advantage and provide exemplary special features.  There is an extensive commentary with the film and disc 2 contains a documentary on the making of the film, an in depth look at the prime suspect thru real participants in the search and most importantly an almost 2 hour feature length documentary THIS IS THE ZODIAC SPEAKING which chronicles every aspect of the investigation including in depth interviews with even surviving victims.  All the special features are presented in HD and are worth the price of this set in themselves.<br /><br />This film is a quality piece of work and this 2 disc Directors Cut blu ray shows blu ray at its best and is a must.  I highly recommend it.</p></body></html>

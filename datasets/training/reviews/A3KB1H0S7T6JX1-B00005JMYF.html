<meta name="summary" content=""Take care of your balls..."></head><body><p>...and they will take care of you."<br /><br />An excellent comedy, Dodgeball, brings to the screen the story of a gym owner and his friends as they take part in the annual Dodgeball tournament in order to win 50,000 dollars and save their gym from a hostile takeover.<br /><br />Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Christine Taylor, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!<br /><br />There are also the guest appearances of actors such as William Shatner, Hank Azaria, Chuck Norris, and David Hasselhoff among others, who add a great deal to the overall enjoyment.<br /><br />Very well written and very well presented, it allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over and over again!<br /><br />The pirate was a bit much, but the setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!  Quotes like "Time to put your mouth where your balls are," says it all!<br /><br />Finally, the dvd's Special Features are a "must."  The deleted scenes, the bloopers, and the alternative ending are so worth it!<br /><br />In short, Dodgeball is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection (if you haven't done so already)!  4.5 Stars</p></body></html>

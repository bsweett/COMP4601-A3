Just throw George Clooney together with Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Eliott Gould, Bernie Mack, Casey Affleck, Al Pacino, and Carl Reiner; add an impossible plot; and let them run from the starting gate. The plot is almost impossible to untangle, but it's a fun piece of nonsense nonetheless.  Ocean (Clooney) wants to win back the casino business to Reuben (Gould) whose rival is a casino hotel owner (Pacino).  The sabotage is multi-faceted and often can raise eyebrows.  (It seems that some of the work would have to be more slippery to escape detection, and the sabotage would have to be less costly than the payoffs might suggest.)  The film's methods at least give the venture some credibility, and the execution is too breezy to make us even care.  Often friendly and fun, 'Ocean's 13' has a message added to the mix in a way that doesn't seem tacked on but naturally fits into the story.</p></body></html>

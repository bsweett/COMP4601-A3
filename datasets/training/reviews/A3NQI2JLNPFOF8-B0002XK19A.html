<meta name="summary" content="It's soooo Sam Raimi"></head><body><p>Pleased with his directoral accomplishment of the first film and comfortable with his talents, Sam Raimi weaves this film together with a fluidic ease that comes across flawless to every single moviegoer that saw this.  It's not perfect, of course, but still worthy of five stars and repeated viewings.  It's been said over and over but the best thing about this movie is that it chooses to focus on Peter Parker rather than Spider-Man.  The major theme is: What drives us to do the things we do and is it worth doing these things even if we suffer?  Someone mentioned to me once that he found it ridiculus that Parker only seemed clumsy and unsure of himself when he was in street clothes and not in the Spider-Man suit.  Actually, this is what is facinating about the character.  His clumsiness is all in his head untill he puts on the mask....then he reafirms himself that he is more than just a geeky kid.  Parker's problem is that he doesn't know how to carry that confidence with him throughout his ordinary life.  This is what's so charming about the character.  He's NOT a super-man.  He's NOT perfect.  He CAN'T save the world.  But he's learning how to be a real person.  Not just a superhero.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Unfocused and overlong"></head><body><p>Although only one screenwriter is credited, "Iron Man 2" has the classic hallmark of scripts that have gone through multiple writers and script doctors: a plethora of disparate elements shoehorned together without regard for the narrative as a whole.<br /><br />"Iron Man 2" starts off promising, with an interesting conflict between Stark and the Federal Government.  The first 10 minutes set it up as "Atlas Shrugged" with a powersuit, featuring Tony Stark as Hank Reardon.  The Feds and their favored contractors are, unsurprisingly, not happy at being cut out of the defense business by a non-state actor.  Indeed, the enemies Iron Man faces in the course of the movie are non-state actors as well, a nod (conscious or unconscious) to the unsustainability of the welfare-warfare state.<br /><br />But enough of that.  Instead of a tight, interesting movie, we get a bunch of diversions that keep Iron Man from encountering the Stinky Russian, his primary enemy, until 30 minutes in.  Mickey Rourke plays Stinky Russian, and you can darn near smell him whenever he's on screen.  OK, that's cool, but then there's some corporate succession issues, the pointless use of SHIELD, and Scarlett Johansson phoning it in as Stark's new assistant.  Every scene with her is grating and unnecessary.  Oh, then there are some other plot points that would be spoilers that I will avoid.  Rather than a complete narrative, we get bogged down in Act 2 and just stay there from a long time spinning our wheels.  Even when the movie finally gets going again, the climax manages to be anticlimactic.<br /><br />"Iron Man 2" is saved only by Downey, Rourke and Rockwell.  All three are so talented that they uplift the material and keep this move from becoming a complete trainwreck.  The cleverness and tight writing of the first movie is absent here.  Rent if you must, but you are likely to be disappointed.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Inspiring and Tragic"></head><body><p>Million Dollar Baby is a film perspective of women's boxing that is reflective, which contains: success, heartbreak, and personal development. All the lead characters have their own misfortunes, which makes them individually inspiring. Clint Eastwood keeps the narrative lively with raw humour, whilst also exposing some of the inadequacies of human nature such as moral degradation. It is indeed the cold hearted selfishness on the part of some supporting characters, which makes the tragedies of this movie seem like worthy sacrifices. Subsequently, the taste of pride and personal attainment can clearly be missed in life, if not sometimes taken with the risk of great cost.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W.

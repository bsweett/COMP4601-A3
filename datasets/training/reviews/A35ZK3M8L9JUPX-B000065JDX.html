<meta name="summary" content="From Dusk Till Dawn"></head><body><p>The notorious Gecko Brothers, two of America's most dangerous criminals, are on the run from the Texas police and the FBI after a crime spree through the Southwest. Across the border in Mexico, the mysterious Carlos offers sanctuary to criminals on the lam, but first they must slip past the border patrol. Enter the Fuller family: Jacob, a minister who has lost his faith and his children, the vulnerable teenage Kate and her younger brother Scott, on a road trip in their new R.V. The Gecko Brothers kidnap the Fullers and high-tail it to freedom with the promise to let the family go once they hook up with their criminal connection in Mexico. From dusk till dawn, is a weird, but unique movie in it's genre. It's entertaining.</p></body></html>

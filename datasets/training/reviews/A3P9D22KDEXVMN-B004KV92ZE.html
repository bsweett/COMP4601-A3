The movie was very entertaining with several laugh out loud moments.  Po Panda, as voiced by Jack Black, was hilarious with many witty one-liners.  Other voice work actors included Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogan, and Dustin Hoffman, excellent as the voice for Kung Fu master Shifu.<br /><br />The film is rated PG as there are numerous scenes involving martial arts combat.  I did not find it too violent for young children over the age of 9 years old.  I am sure it would not be bad for younger as well, but that is each parent's call.<br /><br />The message in the movie was very positive and delivered in a way that was a lot of fun.  This is a movie that the entire family can enjoy, as mine sure did.<br /><br />I give this a strong 4.5 star rating.  Great fun, funny, and with a great message.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

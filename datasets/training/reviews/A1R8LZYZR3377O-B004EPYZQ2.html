This is Spielberg trying so hard to get the freshness of ET and the creativity of "Amazing Stories" . It's a mish-mosh combination that goes off the rails.<br /><br />The film actually starts off producing mild interest for the first twenty five minutes. Some annoying half teen/half something else kids of 1979 suburbia are working on making a home style movie. That's about the only part that held my interest because I had done the same as a youngster, but after the big train wreck, this monstrosity goes on and on with noise and nonsense. The kids get caught up in some military generated creature bs (or restrained alien- who knows) that plays out like a far fetched kiddie film. Most movies generate improbability, but this film throws in the kitchen sink and more as it scrambles for high octane interest.<br /><br />The creature is so wicked and destructive that no one in their right mind, let alone a kid, would want to come near the thing. The CGI seems old school and detracts as the monster who is wisely hidden with glimpses reveals itself. Of course one pre- teen boy can stop this fiend in it's tracks with vocal civility. Sub plots including a weirdly displayed kid crush and conflicting dads fall flat all around. Remove the sci -fi aspect and you have big screen Hallmark movie. A concoction of metal, lights and crud is whipped up to create an excuse of an ending. It couldn't come fast enough for this dud.</p></body></html>

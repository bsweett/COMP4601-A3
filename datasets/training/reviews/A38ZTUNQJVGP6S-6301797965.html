The whole movie was shot in black and white and incorporates Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, and Son of Frankenstein. The movie was played strictly for laughs and it has a lot of them. Some of the on going gags are Igor (pronounced "Eye-gor") ever changing hump on his back. On scene it is on the left side and on another scene the right side. Also when ever anyone says the name Frau Bl&uuml;cher or just Bl&uuml;cher, the horses goes wild. Also there are few minor mistakes as well. Gene Wilder role of Dr. Frederick Frankenstein is the grandson of the late Dr. Victor Frankenstein. In one scene; he is referred to as the great-grandson. Also Inspector Kemp right arm is artificial, but when he is searching for the Monster in the woods, it is on the left side. Finally when Dr. Frederick Frankenstein and Inspector Kemp are playing darts, Dr. Frankenstein only throws two darts through the window. When Inspector Kemp heads toward his car and drive off; the scene shows six darts. The movie starts off with the coffin of Baron Beaufort Von Frankenstein, the Great-grandfather of Dr. Frederick Frankenstein, being open.  A lawyer for the Frankenstein family is sent to the United States to tell Dr. Frederick Frankenstein that he has inherited his Great-grandfather estate. Dr. Frederick Frankenstein travels to Transylvania and meets up with Igor and Inga. One night Dr. Frankenstein hears music and along with Inga investigate the source of the music. It leads him to his grand-father private libray and the book How I Did It. After reading the book, Dr. Frankenstein believes he can do it as well and did up a body of a recently huge criminal. Igor is sent to the Brain Depository. After dropping the good brain, Igor picks up the adnormal and brings is back to  Dr. Frankenstein. When the creature is bought back to life and goes wild in the lab, given a sedative, Dr. Frankenstein asks Igor whose brain is in the that creature. Igor calmly replies that it is an Abby Normal's brain. Dr. Frankenstein is angry with Igor that he gave him an abnormal brain. The monster escape and we have the blind man scene where his taken in and the blind man does his best to be polite. When the blind man offers the Creature a cigar and tries to light one up for him, he burns the creature thumb and the Creatue leaves screaming. He finally make his way back to the castle where Dr. Frankenstein shows him love and compasion. At an evening gather Dr. Frankenstein shows off The Creature to fellow scientits and doctorts, however, a lightbulb burst and The Creature goes into a fit a rage and is taken into custady. It while The Creature is in custady that the prison guard mocks him and The Creature breaks the chains and escape. Dr. Frankenstein plays music to bring The Creature back to the castle for a serious operation. The operation is a succes and The Creatue is nolonger evil. Despite the minor goofs, this is Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder at their finest. I am giving Young Frankenstein an AAAAA+++++.</p></body></html>

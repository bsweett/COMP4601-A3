<meta name="summary" content="Like The Hangover, but funnier (a guy's perspective)"></head><body><p>Bridesmaids is sort of a female version of the Hangover. There's the person who's about to get married (with the fiance largely absent), a goofy sibling comes into the picture, with one of the main characters of the film in a lousy relationship. But Bridesmaids stretches the story over a longer period of time and includes more characters (and it packs in way more character development). It's also funnier, even if it is a bit more formulaic and relies somewhat too much on caricatures (like, as gut-bustingly hilarious as they are, main character Annie's screwball roommates, a disgusting brother-sister pair). As interesting as it is to watch Annie's goofy ups and downs, and her fine acting, she does come off as a younger Meg Ryan in the way that, as attractive and likable as she is, she just can't seem to get her life together. Better than all that is the dialogue, which is pretty sassy, especially when it comes to the over-the-top sister of the groom, Meghan, played by Melissa McCarthy, who is a swarthy and raunchy butch chick (her suggestion for a bachelorette party is to do a ladies Fight Club for the young bride). Jill Clayburgh is awesome as Annie's wacky mother; sadly, it was her last film as she died of leukemia in November 2010 (ironically, her first film credit was for The Wedding Party in 1969). As for the plot, it's pretty predictable... but what a ride! Like all comedies, this one also devolves into a few pivotal "key life lesson scenes" that are as serious as they are unnecessary (do we really care how and when the bride came to her senses and realised who her true friend really were?), but they are short-ish, and we quickly get back to the hilarity with a dose of... Wilson Phillips?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="WOW!"></head><body><p>The film brings to the screen the story of a centuries old blood feud between vampires and werewolves (Lycans).  Things get more complicated when a human doctor is caught up in the conflict, as he becomes the means for creating a vampire-werewolf hybrid, something that could tip the balance between the combatants.<br /><br />Underworld is a highly entertaining, action packed adventure/thriller with significant elements of horror.<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale (who is GORGEOUS!!!), Bill Nighy, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!<br /><br />The plot, the setting, the special effects, the MUSIC, and the swordfights are all EXCELLENT!  Underworld is a movie guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!<br /><br />In conclusion, the film establishes a GREAT cliffhanger for a sequel, which I would definitely line up to watch!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good adaptation"></head><body><p>In May 2008 I went travelling on my own for a month taking in Singapore, New Zealand, Australia and Thailand. With ten flights in all and lots of waiting at the airports I armed myself with five novels for the journey but by the time I reached Sydney I'd finished them all! I needed further reading so bought Ian McEwan's Atonement and was so engrossed it became only the third novel I have read in a single day - the others being Clive Barker's The Thief of Always and Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Being a novel I loved so much after the first read I approached Joe Wright's 2007 film adaptation with both hope and anxiety.<br /><br />The film focuses on three principal characters - Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan), Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley) and Robbie Turner (James McAvoy) - during different periods in their lives. At the outset Briony is thirteen, an aspiring writer with a rich imagination. Her older sister Cecilia has completed her education as has Robbie Turner, the son of the family's housekeeper who has been financed through his education by Briony and Cecilia's father. During the summer in 1935 Briony witnesses an encounter between Cecilia and Robbie by the fountain, one of sexual tension and developing feelings, but one the girl interprets as Robbie being something of a sexual predator. Further incidents that day are also misunderstood by Briony and culminate in her accusing Robbie of a crime he has not committed. So convincing is Briony that only Cecilia and Robbie's mother believe she is lying but it doesn't stop Robbie being sent to prison. The film then switches to 1939 where Robbie has been released from prison in exchange for his service in the Second World War where he is shipped to France. Cecilia has now chosen to abandon her family out of loyalty to Robbie and has become a nurse in London. Eighteen year old Briony (Romola Garai) is also training to be a nurse and contacts Cecilia to inform her that she now realises her mistake and wants to put things right.<br /><br />Ian McEwan's novel is a masterpiece and was always ideal for a film adaptation but only if it was done right. Joe Wright has thankfully got most things right but unfortunately not all. First and foremost is the casting of the three main characters. We have three actresses playing Briony at different stages of her life and all were very good, particularly Saoirse Ronan. The film's problem for me came with the casting of Keira Knightley as Cecilia. Knightley has often been called wooden in the past and I felt she just wasn't right for the role of Cecilia. I didn't get the same emotional depth and complexity of the character of Cecilia as the book conveys. I feared such a blemish could have dragged the film down badly but thankfully Joe Wright cast James McAvoy as Robbie and here is the high point of Atonement. McAvoy brilliantly captures the changing character of Robbie beginning as the educated but dutiful inferior to the Tallis family before we see him physically and mentally destroyed by his service in the Second World War. McAvoy has come a long way since his days in Shameless and I think it's crucial that he gets a lot of screen time in Atonement particularly when showing us his time as a soldier.<br /><br />Wright has captured many of the elements of the novel well here. The idyllic rural home of the Tallis family is colourful and sumptuous, contrasting brilliantly with the ravaged and war torn France where Robbie witnesses some horrific events before leading the last of his comrades to Dunkirk. The soldiers' arrival at the beach sees the camera hover over the soldier's heads as they negotiate long grass before we are given a terrific panoramic shot of Dunkirk, overcrowded with soldiers waiting desperately for ships to evacuate them. We don't see any conflict in Atonement but the reality of war is vivid enough just watching the soldiers wait at Dunkirk, sitting targets for the Germans. Back in London Cecilia has already been hardened by her duty as a nurse while she waits for news of Robbie. Briony, who has opted not to go to Cambridge, is learning of the horrors of war as she tends to the wounded and visibly feels torn apart by guilt at the fate she has sentenced Robbie to, who prior to his arrest has aspirations of continuing his education and being a doctor, a path that would surely have kept him out of the army.<br /><br />Watching Atonement and finding much to appreciate but other areas quite weak I waited with trepidation for the moment when Briony, Cecilia and Robbie are reunited for the first time since Robbie's arrest. This is such a crucial part in the book that it had to be done right in celluloid. With McAvoy having proved himself up to this point it didn't surprise me when he excelled during this exchange, telling Briony exactly what he thinks of her while Cecilia looks on with no pity for her sister who has destroyed so many lives. The shocking twist in the novel hits just as hard in the film as an elderly Briony looks back on her life. When I first finished the novel I was full of anger at the character of Briony and the question at the end is has she atoned for the past? I felt the same anger watching the film which proves what a good job the actresses that played Briony did. Knightley's performance is the film's major disappointment but everything else is faithful to the book with McAvoy the undoubted star of the show.<br /><br />An adaption of Atonement could easily have been done badly and although Joe Wright's film isn't perfect it has captured the essence of Ian McEwan's masterpiece. Both are worth the experience but if I had to choose between the two I would opt to read the novel. However, if you're looking for a good drama then head for Atonement but do have those hankies on standby.</p></body></html>

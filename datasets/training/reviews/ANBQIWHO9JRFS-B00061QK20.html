Simply put, this is the most visually striking film I've ever seen with some astounding action scenes, while still having an interesting plot and strong emotional impact. That is about as strong of an endorsement as I can imagine.<br /><br />Despite it's various points of interest, the visual splendor of the film is certainly the most impressive aspect.  As I said before, this is the most beautiful film I've ever seen. Frankly, little I can think of comes at all close.  Visually, it works on all levels. It has stunning, varied landscapes ranging from snowy mountains to forests in autumn to desolate, rocky steppes and great deserts filled with sand dunes.  Personally, I seem have less appreciation for natural landscapes than most, yet every outdoor landscape in this film is awe-inspiringly beautiful.  The costumes are outstanding as well, with deep, pure colors.  Beyond this, the film uses color beautifully in general, with most scenes having a dominant color in character and landscape, which changes from Red to Blue to Green to White and so on.  This use of color also fills the film with an appropriate sense of surreality, befitting the supernatural and occasionally parable-esque nature of the film.  The film also contains the strange beauties of military formations. There are awe-inspiring shots of the endless ranks with their fluid symmetries, scenes of cavalry riding through the windswept desert and the frightful volleys of arrows. Despite not being a war movie this has the finest visualization of ground forces that I've ever seen, surpassing even the extraordinary The Thin Red Line. (In terms of aesthetic beauty, not realism, of course)  Naturally, this is all beautifully shot, with tons of extreme longshots, which wonderfully showcase the beauty of both the human and inhuman portions of the scene.  On top of this, the action scenes are fantastic.  Personally, I consider the fight between Nameless and Sky at the beginning of the film to be one of the finest 1 on 1 fights I've ever seen.  The fight between Moon and Flying Snow in the leaf strewn forest is also particularly extraordinary, albeit more for the scenery than for the fight choreography.  The only minor misstep is the fight at the lake in the mountains, which is fine except that it repeats itself a bit too much.  There are many who are opposed to wire-work and the use of CG and whatnot, and those sorts will likely have issues with the fights found here.  Indeed, the action scenes here are usually as much art film as they are action film, and most of them are so wildly stylized that purists won't care for them. So consider yourself warned, not that you needed to be had you seen any ads for the film.  I suppose I could go on and on about how this film looks, but I could never hope to give you a true sense of how fantastic this film looks. Just see it yourself.<br /><br />Unlike many films with such an emphasis on visuals and action-scenes, this film has interesting characters and a well developed plot.  I could go into specifics, but suffice to say that it managed to retain hold my interest from beginning to end, the ending of the film is genuinely sad, and every significant character in the film is sympathetic in their own way, even though they may be at odds with one another.  This is as much as you could ask for from a purely dramatic film, much less a martial arts film.  Some people have found this film a bit confusing, as it is primarily told via flashbacks,  which may or may not have actually occurred.  Personally, I wasn't confused, and at worst you will likely be lost only briefly if ever.  And the plot isn't the main interest in the film anyway.<br /><br />Some have complained of the pro-communist elements of this film, but I can honestly say as one who strongly opposes communism both as it exists hypothetically and practically that this doesn't bother me at all.  Most significantly, it is mainly implicitly pro-communist, in that it is patriotic and pro-China as an idea rather than specifically supporting the communist government.  Beyond, little that is in the film specifically applies to communism in a way that wouldn't apply to most other societies.  At it's heart, it simply promotes  peace and self-sacrifice for the common good, both of which are valued in pretty much all societies, and are qualities which I can readily support.<br /><br />Well, that's it. This is one of the finest films I've ever seen, so you ought to go see it.</p></body></html>

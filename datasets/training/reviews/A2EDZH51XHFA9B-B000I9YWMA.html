(In the<br />interim, they filmed and released independently a<br />feature-length documentary called American Pimp,<br />recently reviewed here.) Based on Alan (Watchmen)<br />Moore's graphic novel, the tale focuses on Fred<br />Abberline (Johnny Depp), a Scotland Yard inspector<br />who, unfortunately for him, lands the case of Jack the<p>Ripper. (Note: the main IMDB page for the movie<br />contains a MAJOR spoiler, so avoid it if you're<br />planning on seenig the movie.) Abberline is a<br />precognitive, and aids his visions with liberal use of<br />opium and its derivative laudanum, often landing in<br />subterranean opium dens, usually to be hauled out by<br />staunch sidekick Peter Godley (Robbie Coltrane of<br />_Cracker_ fame). As they delve deeper into the<br />investigation, they find that maybe bureaucracy isn't<br />all that's holding them up; Abberline finds himself<br />watched by Scotland Yard's Special Branch, headed by<br />the sinister Ben Kidney (veteran character actor<br />Terence Harvey).<p><p>The movie is put together beautifully; not a scene is<br />ill-shot or out of place, and the violence inherent in<br />a retelling of the Ripper story is kept to an<br />as-tasteful-as-possible minimum. The sweeping<br />cinematography is on a par with Alex Proyas' similarly<br />claustrophobic Dark City (1998), and the film's<br />atmosphere is quite successful at drawing the veiwer<br />in.<p><p>Where From Hell fails its two Hughes-helmed<br />predecessors is in the characterization. No character<br />here gets the same pervasive treatment as did O-Dogg<br />in _Menace II Society_, for example; many minor<br />characters seem cardboard cutouts, and even Abberline<br />and obligatory love interest (and historical Ripper<br />victim) Mary Kelly (Heather Graham, finally coming up<br />with a role with as much potential as the one she had<br />in _Drugstore Cowboy_) don't really get the depth of<p>character they deserve. The characters are all too<br />readily predictable, and the snarkier part of my mind<br />wants to lay that fault at the doorstep of Alan Moore;<br />after all, the Hughes Brothers have a long-established<br />track record of bringing characters to life.<p><p>Which brings us to the other predictable element of<br />the move: the plot. Even those unfamiliar with various<br />Ripper hypotheses should be able to figure out who the<br />Ripper is by halfway through the film, and the twist<br />ending should be obvious even before the scene starts;<br />despite this, Albert and Allen do have one last twist<br />of the knife left for the penultimate scene. While the<br />film doesn't resolve as satisfactorily as did Menace<br />or Dead Presidents, Hollywood hasn't completely taken<br />over the wunderkinder yet.<p><p>It's certainly not the tour de force Menace II Society<br />was, but From Hell is a surprisingly literate thriller<br />in a year that's given us the usual Hollywood helping<br />of mindless dreck; another pearl in the string that<br />already holds Memento and The Others. Too bad it has<br />to be cast among such swine as See Spot Run, Jurassic<br />Park III, The Princess Diaries, etc. etc. ad nauseam.<br />*** 1/2</p></body></html>

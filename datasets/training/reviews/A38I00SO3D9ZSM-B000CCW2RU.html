<meta name="summary" content="Blade Runner warmed over"></head><body><p>Warning:  possible spoilers below.<br /><br />Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johannson both play their parts well. The visual effects are nice. The script is OK. Several scenes are completely ludicrous -- there is no way a human being could survive a few of the things that happen, particularly to walk away with only some dirty clothes and a scratch on the face -- but those scenes don't ruin the movie.<br /><br />Just beware that this story has been told many times before. It's Blade Runner w/a twist.<br /><br />Blade Runner -- Replicants, created to do human labor, realize they are "human" and fight to survive. The will to survive is, of course, a glitch in their design.<br /><br />I Robot -- Robots, created to do human labor, realize they are human and fight to survive. The will to be human is a glitch in their design.<br /><br />Bicentennial Man -- A robot, created to do human labor, realizes he is "human" and fights for his "rights". His humanity is a glitch in his design.<br /><br />The Island -- Clones ("Agnates"), created to supply human tissue to their original counterparts, have genetic memories and begin to realize the world around them is fake. Their real (not programmed) memory and human curiousity are glitches in their design. They fight to live and be recognized as real human beings, not just "product".<br /><br />The movie is enjoyable but ultimately hollow and unoriginal.  Don't expect anything original or challenging and you might enjoy it.</p></body></html>

I got totally caught up, especially in the decadence, which struck me as very realistic. The basement bunker filled with Idi Amin and his followers seems right on. I can easily imagine that kind of "scene" - we have seen this before with American rock stars and now with rap stars who have hit it big and don't know what to do with their power and money. It's girls girls, girls, drugs, then violence every time. The acting is very strong. Forest Whitaker is amazing, completely convincing as the sentimental monster. The rest of the cast is forgettable, but adequate; perhaps this is due to under writing the parts. None of the women for example is developed. Still, the movie is carried by Whitaker who turns in an extraordinary performance.</p></body></html>

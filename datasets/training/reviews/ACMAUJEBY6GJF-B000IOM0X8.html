Ah, I wanted to like this movie, I didn't expect it to be in the league of Indiana Jones, but at least somewhere near National Treasure. But no. While watching I almost forgot about the entire ship, the advertising of Sahara says "The hunt for the gold begins here" and "The search for the mysterious ship" blablabla, but the filmmakers were too hung up in the action and special effects (yeah, so what's new right?) -I love adventure movies, they don't even have to be realistic, it's all about fun and exitment. Sahara is a failure, lacks charm and story, and will soon be forgotten.</p></body></html>

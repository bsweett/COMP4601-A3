The movie is very very Kubrick... slow, sticky  scenes that last just long enough to make you dreadfully uncomfortable,  music that is perfectly married to each scene and stark, surreal lighting  that's part fantasy, part cold reality.<p>This is a film about fidelity,  fantasy and the reality of marriage compared to the illusion of lust and  infidelity... the strength of marriage versus the weaknesses of lust....  good versus evil.... loyalty versus abandonment. <p>There's really not much  I can say without ruining the story... but this is a finely made film. Well  thought out, haunting, unforgettable. <p>I've heard a lot of people  commenting on this movie without having seen it... guessing from the  previews that it's just a sex flick... this is not the case. If your jaw is  not hanging open, you'll be sitting on the edge of your seat during most of  this film.<p>The DVD has TV spots, the theatrical trailer and interviews  with Cruise, Kidman and Steven Spielberg. If you liked &quot;2001: A Space  Odyssey&quot; and &quot;The Shining&quot; as much for the direction by  Kubrick as you did for the story this film will not be a disappointment.  Kubrick's hand is more than evident in this film, just like you can tell a  Renoir from a Van Gogh... you can tell when Kubrick has been behind a piece  of film.</p></body></html>

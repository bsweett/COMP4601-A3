Yes it had all the elements (except the fifth) that make for a good shoot-um-up space thing. But I just looked at it as an action movie.<br /><br />For some reason this movie can grow on you and you find yourself anticipating the next move. Then you see things that you did not see the first time. Then you start to mouth the words. Soon this turns into a five star movie with a plot, good guys, bad guys, and good bad guys. Soon you start looking in your auto-wash to see if you left anything in there.<br /><br />An ancient thereat of dome looms over the earth. An ancient religion keeps the secret of the doom and the secret of the defense (the fifth element.) Prophecy turns into reality and it is up to Major Koeben Dallas (Bruce Willis) to find the fifth element and save the earth.<br /><br />Will he be able to do this and at what emotional expense?<br /><br />What is the fifth element?</p></body></html>

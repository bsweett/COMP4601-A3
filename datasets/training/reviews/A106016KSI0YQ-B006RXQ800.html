<meta name="summary" content="History and butchery"></head><body><p>Any film that tries to recreate mid-nineteenth-century New York has to have something going for it, and director Martin Scorsese's gorgeous recreation of the Five Points and Paradise Square in the 1840s and 1860s certainly is the sort of the thing you won't get to see very often. The plot of this expensive over-the-top mess has something to do with how "America" (by which Scorsese means... New York? Manhattan? the immigrant population?) was supposed to have been established by mob violence waged between the Irish, represented by (wait for it) Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo di Caprio), and the self-named "Natives," led by "Wild" Bill Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis). (There's even a U2 rock anthem at the end, "The Hands that Built America," to hammer home this  dubious point.) The whole thing is ridiculously overscaled and all kinds of historical figures from the day keep wandering in to make cameos, from  Horace Greeley to P.T. Barnum to Boss Tweed, as Di Caprio and Day-Lewis go at each other with every kind of deadly bladed implement you can imagine. The film's bizarre messing of history finds it nadir during the Draft Riots (which forms a chaotic set-piece conclusion), when Scorsese shows the mobs storming and burning the mansion of the Schermerhorns (suggesting they're going to kill them) and the Union fleet warships firing  their big guns into lower Manhattan.<br /><br />What was Scorsese trying to do with this movie? It seems to be on the same silly scale as Brian Di Palma's SCARFACE, but somehow mixed with BIRTH OF A NATION; the whole thing seems staggeringly misconceived. Neither Di Caprio nor Cameron Diaz as his pickpocket love interest seem to have the slightest idea what they're doing in the film. As the Grand Guignol villain, the fictitious Bill Cutting (who is even given a glass eye he likes to tap with a knife point), Daniel Day-Lewis gives a wildly sweaty and over-the-top performance that many people for some reason took very seriously at the time the film was released.</p></body></html>

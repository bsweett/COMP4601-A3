In case the title fooled ya, this is the sequel to Blade - with Mr. Wesley Snipes (after watching his killer moves in this flick, I can't bring myself to even talk about him without the most earnest deference).  The "Blade" movies are set in a fun-house mirror version of our own world, in which a race of supercharged vampires (appearing little different than the everyday corporate variety) use their superior powers and wealth to rise to the top of the food chain.  Reprising his role as a daywalker, a sort of a mutant hybrid of human and vampire, Snipes wars against the Vampires (whom he calls suckerheads). As we learnt in the first "Blade" flick, Blade has all the powers that come with being one of the undead (including a killer fashion sense and an attitude to match; also he's really quick with a samurai sword and can absorb punishment that would kill lesser comic-book heroes). For reasons that have beguiled the vampires, he has none of their weaknesses. Blade uses killer moves, a samurai sword that seems to have a mind of its own, various gadgets and his attitude. Having dispatched a would-be Vampire king in the first movie, Blade is offered a chance to join the suckerheads when a mutant race of vampires called Reapers sets its appetites on everybody. With sideways-opening mouths, super-speed and a heart almost completely encased in solid bone (my stake won't work! Would you believe that this has never happened to me before?), the Reapers stalk vampires much as vampires hunted humans. Against the advice of his friends (including Kris Kristofferson as a crusty mortal who's endured so much suffering, he might as well be one of the dead) Blade joins the suckerheads in annihilating the Reapers. Dangers aside, Blade reasons that the pact will allow him to get closer to the vampires than he's ever been able to before, and anyway, should the reapers nosh the vampires to extinction, they'll add the human race to their menu.<br /><br />So, why doesn't this movie completely rock? For one thing, it's so dark that it's hard to tell what's going on during the fast battle-scenes. Also, sexed-up for battle, our hero and his not-so-loyal band of undead foot-soldiers are encased in body-armor, armed to the teeth and shielded with their glasses - it's like watching a movie about action figures. The characters walk and talk like soulless AI characters in some hopped-up videogame. (Unfortunately, I caught this flick about the same time "Demolition Man" was on, and it was enlightening to see how much more spirited Mr. Snipes was Simon Phoenix in that flick.) Our badguys die in predictable and uninspiring CGI pyrotechnics, and speak either n a pastiche of four-letter words and pseudo-hard boiled tough speak ("yeah? Take off your sunglasses and say that, punk!"), or some of the overly dead-serious and clinically precise babble you'd find in either overpriced comics or on episodes of "Star Trek: The Next Generation".  "Blade II" is supposed to be about tough guys, but it's not very tough at all. If ever a movie needed the "Simon Phoenix" treatment, this is it.</p></body></html>

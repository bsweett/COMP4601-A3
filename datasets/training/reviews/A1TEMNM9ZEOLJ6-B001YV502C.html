However, it falls down on plot line and audio quality. Was it just me, or was the dialogue very hard to make out, never mind the thick British accents? A few years into the future, no babies have been born for 18 years and the world population is dying off, split among re-"fugees"- and the rest, a commentary on today's war on terror, one presumes. But one woman delivers a baby, and the movie is all about trying to get her ... somewhere....called "the human project.' I have no idea what that was. Most of the movie is a long chase scene through war zones and various attacks, shot by handheld camera. The look is fascinating, but the content is a weakness.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="AVPR: Aliens vs Predator Requiem............"></head><body><p>Aliens vs Predator:Requiem is the 2007 sequel to Alien vs Predator. Directed by The Brothers Strause, it stars Steven Pasquale, Reiko Aylesworth, and John Ortiz. Picking up after the events of the first movie, the predator known as "Scar" erupts with a chestburster on board his Predator ship. While the chestburster's form has taken some characteristics of the Predator, it grows into a new hybrid of alien known as a Predalien. The Predalien sneaks onto a scout ship and kills a Predator on board. In an attempt to kill the Predalien another Predator fires his shoulder cannon which punctures the hull of the ship and brings it down on Earth in none other than Gunnison, Colorado. The Predator then sends out a distress signal to other Predators before he dies, which ultimately brings another. When he arrives, all (ahem) heck breaks loose and people as well as Aliens start to die. I would've loved to see them continue the story set in the first one, though, but you can't have it all. Can you?<br /><br />I totally understand why many people dislike this movie so. First of all, the lighting in the movie is awful. I know they were trying to set a tone for the movie in which to scare everyone by but why make it so dark that noone can barely see what's going on on-screen. Second, the storyline wasn't as well developed as the first movie and it truly shows. Because of that fact alone, it makes the movie come across as more of a cheesy horror flick than a serious AvP movie. It's clear The Brothers Strause know very little about making an AvP movie...a good one anyways. Shame on 20th Century Fox for putting out this. It looks to me like they want to cash in on the AvP thing while they can..or else why would they release a movie like this?<br /><br />The Unrated version includes five behind the scenes featurettes as well as commentary and multiple still galleries.<br /><br />On a side note, a third film in the series has been planned by Fox so we can look forward to seeing the series continue as well as seeing the storyline finish up(when that will be is anyone's guess). If Fox knows what's good for them, they'll make up for their mistake by getting Paul W.S. Anderson back to make the next one. Us fans, definitely, deserve better.</p></body></html>

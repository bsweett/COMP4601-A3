<meta name="summary" content="War is Hell"></head><body><p>Sam Mendes has made two other films, both very fine and very different: "American Beauty," an evisceration of American Society and "Road to Perdition," a `30's-era film about family, fathers and revenge. Both films have strong emotional centers and defined points-of-view both things that Mendes' latest does not.<br /><br />"Jarhead" is about Anthony Swofford (a detached Jake Gyllenhaal) and his experiences training for/being in and living through Desert Storm. There are the requisite scenes of Marine camaraderie, tough drill sergeant stuff and basic guy-to guy humiliation. And these scenes are humorous at times and sometimes not.<br /><br />The problem with "Jarhead"is that, at its core it is empty and more damaging...it is often boring. Once Swofford and his company arrive in the Middle East, it's a lot of waiting, more training and even more training. And when it finally dawns on us that there will be no actual combat...that Swofford will never actually aim and shoot his rifle at an enemy, we are more than ready for the ordeal to be over.<br /><br />Most of the performances lack energy and this we can only place on the shoulders of Mendes for Gyllenhall, Jamie Foxx and the formidable Chris Cooper have been excellent elsewhere. The only palpable energy is generated by a showing, to the company of Marines, of the helicopters swooping down onto a Viet Nam village scene to the strains of the "Ride of the Walkueres" in Coppola's "Apocalypse Now": an unfortunate reminder of how a war film should be made.<br /><br />Though beautiful to look at because of Roger Deakins's gorgeous, evocative camerawork, "Jarhead" is like a beautifully wrapped gift when, upon untying the bow, you find the box sadly and forlornly empty.</p></body></html>

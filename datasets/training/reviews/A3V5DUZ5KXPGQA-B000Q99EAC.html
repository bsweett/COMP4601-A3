I watched it yesterday and it is a worthy sequel to the original Rocky!<br /><br />Sly Stallone gets knocked a lot by people (myself included) but no one is laughing at him now. Like his fictional son said in the film during his fight with Mason Dixon "Everyone thought this was a joke, including myself! But no one is laughing now!"<br /><br />The story, the acting....everything was well done. I only hope this is the end because I would hate to see it ruined by a bad follow-up. This is a fitting end to the Rocky saga and I would highly recommend this film to anyone's collection whether you're a fan or not!</p></body></html>

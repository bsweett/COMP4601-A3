<meta name="summary" content="Alexander: "In the end, when it's over, all that matters is what you've done.""></head><body><p>This review's title may describe why Oliver Stone thought it necessary to yet again recut his 2004 film, "Alexander." Despite the director's best efforts and intentions, it seems that no amount of tinkering will reclamate what remains a slow-paced historo-epic.<br /><br />Horrendously spastic handheld cameras ruin battle scenes. The frequent dancing girl/orgy sequences are useful only if you need a restroom break or wish to buy a box of Milkduds.<br /><br />Kilmer as one-eyed Philip of Macedon is unattractively porcine, Jolie's overinflated lips look ready to explode and Farrell is badly miscast as conqueror of the ancient world.<br /><br />You want more? This disaster runs 3.5 hours!<br /><br />(DIRECTOR CAMEO: Oliver Stone appears briefly as the Macedonian soldier at Zeus statue.)<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating. It's for the original 2004 release.<br /><br />(5.4) Alexander Revisited: The Final Cut (Germany/USA/Netherlands/France/UK/Italy-2007) - Colin Farrell/Angelina Jolie/Val Kilmer/Anthony Hopkins/Jared Leto/Rosario Dawson/Jonathan Rhys Meyers/Christopher Plummer/Brian Blessed</p></body></html>

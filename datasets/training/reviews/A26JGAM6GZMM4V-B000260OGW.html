<meta name="summary" content="A Worthy Effort"></head><body><p>One of my criticisms of Costner as a director is that he has a tendency to dawdle when developing a plot, devoting far too much time and (albeit loving) attention to the introduction of main characters and their circumstances. Thankfully, the pace accelerates during the middle portion of this film when Boss Spearman (Duvall) and Charley Waite (Costner) finally have their shoot-out with Denton Baxter (Gambon) and his thugs. Then the film resumes its languid pace and the plot gradually evaporates. Obviously, Costner has seen and admires earlier westerns such as Shane, The Sheepman, Will Penny, and Pale Rider. There is a classic formula for westerns and Costner respects it. Probably too much, thereby diminishing dramatic impact.<p>The acting in this film is solid, although (as in Secondhand Lions) Duvall again seems to be recycling his portrayal of Gus McCrae from Lonesome Dove. Annette Bening (playing Sue Barlow) does about as much as anyone could with flimsy material. Costner seems as awkward directing love scenes as he does appearing in them. That is appropriate in this instance, however. He is entirely credible as the "socially challenged" Charley as is Gambon as the obligatory villain, Baxter. The  supporting cast is first-rate, notably Abraham Benrudi, Diego Luna, Michael Jeter, James Russo, and Kim Coates. The production values are outstanding. However, this film seems at least 20-30 minutes too long (its running time is 138 minutes) and I blame that on Costner's direction. Those familiar with Gunga Din (which has a much more complicated plot) may be surprised to know that it has a running time of only 117 minutes. This film is an uneven achievement, not up the standards set by Dances with Wolves, but certainly more entertaining than so many others which have appeared in the last few years.  <p>FYI, because this film consists of three separate but connected parts (Before Shoot-Out, Shoot- Out, and After Shoot-Out), I arrived at a Four Star rating by adding up three separate ratings (Four, Five, and Three Stars) and dividing the total by three. Because of the clumsy final scene between Sue and Charley, I was tempted to deduct a Star but decided to give Costner the benefit of the doubt. His ambition exceeded his reach but Open Range is a worthy effort nonetheless.</p></body></html>

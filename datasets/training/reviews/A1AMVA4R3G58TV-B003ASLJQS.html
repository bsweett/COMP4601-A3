<meta name="summary" content="Deep Dramtic Film"></head><body><p>I attended a screening where Clint Eastwood spoke after the film. He is an outstanding director, who really knows how to tell a dramatic story.The cinemataphy is amazing in this film as well. Tim Robbins is outstanding in his role as a man who was abused in his childhood. The circumstances are sad and disturbing, but the story is very well told. Sean Penn is just amazing, and gives the performace of a lifetime.<br />If you want to see a movie that combines superior acting skils, with wonderful direction, and a dramatic storyline, this is the film to see.</p></body></html>

I saw it in the theater when it was new, and I've played the DVD several times since I bought it over five years ago. But I had indeed forgotten some of the nuances which I enjoyed so much. So rather than spend much time on the basic plot, which you probably already know for the most part, let me tell you of some of the things that struck me as especially fine.<br /><br />I love the special effects that created Dobby. It is through him that we know what a house elf is, even though when we meet Kreature later on, and Winky too, they are rather different. But Dobby is a fully developed character, not just a special effect. He has personality, moves like a living being, and turns out to have a good bit of magic of his own. Aside from the regulars we met in the first movie, I think Dobby may be my favorite.<br /><br />I am also impressed by Tom Riddle. We'll see him again later, too, when Dumbledore shows Harry some of his memories. But this 16-year-old Riddle is charming in a horrible way, and very impressive in a way similar to Anakin Skywalker. We not only see him as a villain, but get an opportunity to glimpse how he got that way.<br /><br />Richard Harris plays Dumbledore again, and is truly lovable in his way. Not that I have anything against the guy who replace him, but he remains my visual and auditory image of Dumbledore.<br /><br />Then there is the fool of the piece, Gilderoy Lockhart. If that isn't every ego-mad idiot you've ever known all rolled into one, what is? Of course, underneath his fake reputation is a coward. Seems like that's often the case.<br /><br />It may be just my imagination, but I don't think this one suffered as much in the transformation from book to movie. The basic elements are there, and we get visual images to attach to them when we go back to reading the books. Lucius Malfoy makes a terrific villain, doesn't he? And my favorite Dumbledore quote is there, reworded only a little: "It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities." Important for all of us to remember.</p></body></html>

Your not going to have a hi powered movie executive switch places with a frumpy poor girl. Jack Black is just a horrid actor, why do we have to spend one more second looking at his dumb face. Listening to him doing the humming,duba dooodle dooo doooo, made me want run from from my living room, and jump off the nearest bridge. Not to mention that the trailer guy in the movie was really getting old after the fourth or fifth time. Stay away from this if you demand good movies,this is just gloopy yeck.</p></body></html>

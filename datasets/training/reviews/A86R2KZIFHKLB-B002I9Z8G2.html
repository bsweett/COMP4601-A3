I think this movie is the best one out of the TNG movie series. An all around good movie, the borg reappear with their leader, we get to see how we invented warp drive (sort of) all kinds of fun, very entertaining! Just so you know, this is an upgrade from a vhs tape, eewwww! Enjoy the movie!</p></body></html>

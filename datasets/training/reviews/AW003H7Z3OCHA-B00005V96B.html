<meta name="summary" content="ACTUAL REVIEW of the 2 DVD set of "Monsters, Inc" !"></head><body><p>Thanks to Amazon.com & Disney/PIXAR I received an early release copy of "Monsters, Inc. Collectors Edition 2 Disc DVD set to review.<p>Let me just say for openers that this is Disney / PIXARS best DVD effort yet!!!  This digitally remastered movie has by far the most outstanding quality picture & sound ever. The presentation has both Standard (tv size) and WideScreen Anamorphic & Enhanced for 16x9 hdtv formats.  Note: I have a 55" 16x9 HDTV w/digital Home Theatre Surround Sound and it was a pure joy to watch the vibrant colors and listen to the flawless sound!!  Clearest Picture & Best Digital Sound ever.  What a great experience.  It was better than the movie theatre experience!!<p>Disc 1: the movie provides both Standard & WideScreen format as previously mentioned (the movie is 93 minutes).  Sound is 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround EX Sound Effects (the best ever)!!! Also THX-Certified Sound Track.  Sneak Peeks of future Disney movies...  And movie commentary by PIXAR key Staff members (very informative).<p>Disc 2: Navagational Review to include; "HUMANS ONLY" - tons of information all about PIXAR film making and its talented staff -to include tours of PIXARS amazing facitiies (what a great & fun place to work). "MONSTERS ONLY" - Enter the world of Monsters as a monster employee in this wild factory & train for your first day on the job (games & fun for the entire family).  "NEW MONSTER ADVENTURES" - Great shorts with Mike, Sulley & the Monsters, Inc. gang. to include, MIKES NEW CAR (hilariously funny), FOR THE BIRDS (2001 OSCAR WINNING BEST ANIMATED SHORT - outstanding), MONSTERS TV TREATS (cute stuff), PEEK-A-BOO's Door Game, Monster Story time & more.  BEHIND THE SCREAMS - movie Outtakes (great touch), a monsters company play with the Monster gang. "ON THE JOB" with Mike & Sulley.  "ORIENTATION" - Welcome to Monsters Inc, Your 1st day, History of Monsters, Inc, Employee Handbook, Monster of the Month (gallery), Scarer Cards with audio commentary. (OVER 207 minutes).<p>As you can see there is plenty of family fun on this Collectors Edition on "Monsters, Inc.".<p>In Summary:  As children we were afraid of monsters in our closets.  "Monsters, Inc." is a monster organization which takes advantage of this by collecting our screams (which provides pollution free energy source to the monsters world).  Monster Sulley (John Goodman) the great Big Blue furry monster is the champion scarer & his sidekick partner Mike (Billy Crystal) a short Green One very large Eyed sphere with arms & legs are our main characters (Goodman & Crystal are the perfect team).  The stories twist All of the monsters have one fear...... Children!!!!!  Enjoy this adventure as one child, a 3 year old girl "Boo" enters the monsters world creating havoc everywhere she goes.  This is a fun movie for the entire family.<p>Again this 2-Disc DVD set by Disney/PIXAR is total entertainment and a must for your DVD library! Enjoy.</p></body></html>

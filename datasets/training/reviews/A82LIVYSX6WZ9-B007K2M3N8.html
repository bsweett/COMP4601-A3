<meta name="summary" content="Kevin Spacey is still great..."></head><body><p>Kevin Spacey (Ths Usual Suspects, American Beauty) stars as singer/actor Bobby Darin who lived a life of fame, fortune and had a beautiful wife named Sandra Dee, played by Kate Bosworth (Blue Crush, The Rules Of Attraction). Darin was grown up and taught how to sing and dance and play so many instruments and he can act as well as he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor. When a singer and an actress get together and start a life, of course some of the time, like so many of the couples out there in Hollywood, there's gonna be the ups and downs. Darin starts to get into polictics and turns into a "hippie" but he still knew how to entertain and in the end, his legacy still remains. He had big hits like for example the title of the movie "Beyond The Sea". It's not the best but Kevin Spacey is what makes this movie watchable and so are the supporting cast including Bosworth as Sandra Dee and newcomer little William Ulrich. Spacey also co-wrote and directed. Some of the stuff drags but who can pass a movie where the lead is talking to his childlike self throughout. Also starring John Goodman (Raising Arizona, Roseanne), Greta Scacchi (The Red Violin) and Bob Hoskins (Roger Rabbit, Mario Bros Movie).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A nice attempt, but far to little action and Hulk."></head><body><p>OK, i know most origin stories for comic book movies tend to be weak sometimes, but this film takes FOREVER to get us to the Hulk(and lets face it that IS what we want to see)! Once he comes on screen the movies soars and is very good (I loved the series but the cgi hulk is better than a man in green makeup). The cast is good as is the direction but the movie feels limp for long stretches and is really a mixed-bag.</p></body></html>

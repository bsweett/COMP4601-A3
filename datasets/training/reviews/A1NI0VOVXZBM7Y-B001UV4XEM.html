<meta name="summary" content="The Hangover."></head><body><p>The Hangover has to be the Best Movie I have seen lately and my Favorite So far, A movie doesn't have to have Will Ferrell in order for it to be funny,and in a Age when modern movies really stink it is a welcome refreshment, From Carlos the Baby and The Tiger in The Bathroom to Paging Dr.Fa..et...  And The Chinese Guy, The movie is more Bizarre than Dude Where's My Car, Friggin' Hilarious.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Christmas Classic Brought to you in Glorious HD"></head><body><p>A Christmas without A Christmas Story is unheard of around these parts.  I have been watching this classic since I was a child.  From the first time on VHS to DVD and now Blu-ray.  This story is probably one of the best Christmas tales to come around the past 25 years.  So how does this HD version stack up against all the others?  Very well if you must know.<br /><br />For all of you familiar and unfamiliar with the story it takes place in Cleveland, Ohio in the 1940's.  An America many people seem to remember fondly.  The story centers around a boy named Ralphy and his Christmas wish to have a Red Rider BB gun.  Of course the adults all seem to feel the gun is unsafe and you the repeated phrase, "You'll shoot your eye out."  Although this is really just a small part of the story.<br /><br />Ralphy is like many boys of his age then and now.  On the cusp of adolescence while still having his childish tendencies.  During the movie you get to know his friends and all the people around him.  Every time I watch this movie I realize how much things are the same when it comes to Christmas in middle class America.  This story seems to tell it better and more realistically than most movies made.<br /><br />Now if you have not bought this movie on DVD it is a great value.  The picture is only mildly improved from it's DVD version.  Sometimes you will be wondering if it's really in HD.  Although despite that this is a great movie.  Christmas or not it is a classic.  The Blu-ray version comes with some extras like a anniversary follow up with a few of the child actors.  Although that is not entirely exciting the movie is.</p></body></html>

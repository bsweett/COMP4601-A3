<meta name="summary" content="Great Movie But For An Early Blu-Ray Not Great"></head><body><p>I also have this movie both standard and now the blu-ray version I'm sure most people know about the storyline of this movie if not read the Amazon info about it an that is the jist of what the movie is about.  I just want to say to people that if you already have the standard dvd version thats all you're going to need.  The video and sound quality are not much better than what you got with the standard dvd since this is one of the earlier blu-rays to come out and they haven't fully mastered the video and audio yet you won't see any clearer or sharper details or better sound quality with this blu-ray version.  So again if you have the standard dvd Punisher just keep that one and wait until they come out with a remastered blu-ray version or just pass this one up..</p></body></html>

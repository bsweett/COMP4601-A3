<meta name="summary" content="entertainment as it should be"></head><body><p>I'm not usually a big fan of action movies, especially the typical ones centered around a male superhero out to save the world and bag the hot babe at the end.<p>But like &quot;Desperado&quot; and &quot;El Mariachi,&quot; Robert Rodriguez's &quot;Once Upon A Time In America&quot; has all the bang-bang-bang fun without the usual brain-dead male cliches and kindergarten-level myth-making.  His protagonist is one bad dude all right but it's all done in a very light-hearted, cartoonish spirit refreshingly devoid of ludicrous moral pretension or pompous overbearing machismo.  <p>Sure, this film has a more convoluted plot with some populist/democratic/nationalistic subtexts if you care to look for them, but why bother when you have all the Rodriguez trademarks there in full force: black absurdist and surrealist humor, gleefully unbelievable shootouts and acrobatic stunts, wry self-parody, ten-kiloton KNOCKOUT BABES (Eva Mendes and Salma Hayek).  <p>It's not as tight as &quot;El Mariachi&quot; (amazing how tight a $7000 budget makes you) or &quot;Desperado&quot; but compared to the usual crop of Hollywood blockbusters, is an effortless standout.</p></body></html>

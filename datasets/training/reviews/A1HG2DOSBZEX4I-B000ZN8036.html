<meta name="summary" content="Hero or Fool?"></head><body><p>In Sean Penn's magnificently acted film Into the Wild we get the story of Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch) who abandons his upper middle class existence to go an adventure first to the American West and then into the deep wilds of Alaska. Based on the book by Jon Krakauer, Penn does an admirable job telling the story of a youthful nomad in the early 1990's.<br /><br />The cast features great performances by nearly all players. From the bewildered parents (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden), to the sister who deeply loves her brother and is troubled by his actions (Jena Malone) to the friends he meets along the way: aging hippie couple Jan and Rainey (Catherine Keener and Brian Dierker), midwestern farmer (Vince Vaughn) to kindly old man who wants to adopt him (Hal Holbrook) all play a part in showing Christopher the meaning of happiness. There can only be true happiness when it is shared with others.<br /><br />The film apart from the acting looks remarkable. Cinematographer Eric Gautier does Oscar worthy work here and his work on locatio in Alaska is breathtaking. Also worthy of mention is the music. The score by Michael Brook and Kaki King with songs by Eddie Vedder add considerably to the overall viewing experience.<br /><br />I viewed the HD disc by Paramount and was quite pleased with the presentation. The one minus is that there are not the wealth of special features found on the two disc standard definition set. The bonus features consist of roughly 37 minutes of features on the casting and making of the film.<br /><br />While not the happiest film of the year it is well worth checking out and is quite an achievement for Sean Penn.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

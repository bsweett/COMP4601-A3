While Quentin Tarantino stays in my mind as one of the strangest individuals in the entertainment business after perhaps Crispin Glover and Michael Jackson, I think his ability to creat a cinematic masterpiece is of the highest level.<br /><br />This movie stands as one of the greatest movies of all time. The intertwining of movie making and storyline are what make this movie so wonderful! Casting was top notch, as well as makeup and costume design. I liked watching the movie, not being sure if I was watching mid-80's or present time. For the record this movie came out in 1992.<br /><br />I think Samuel L. Jackson deserved an oscar nomination for this one. It was phenomenal watching him on the big screen, especially during the shootout in the apartment. I also very much enjoyed the dialogue between him and John Travolta, especially before the shooting, as they are waiting to enter the apartment.<br /><br />I give this high marks, and hope that others will take the time to watch this wonderful movie.<br /><br />Two thumbs up!

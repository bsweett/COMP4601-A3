Clint actually got some residuals from this movie. He didn't like that the explosives were real and was surprised no one got hurt. I didn't realize Eli Wallach was The Ugly (he was the old guy in THE HOLIDAY) and his army doctor background helped with the torture scene. MY GRADE: A minus to A.</p></body></html>

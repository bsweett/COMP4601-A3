<meta name="summary" content="This is what dreams are made of..."></head><body><p>There is a moment in the film where actor Peter Coyote looks at young Elliott (played magnificently by Henry Thomas) and says "I've been wishing for this since I was 10 years old" and I think that really sums up why this movie is so incredibly special.  This is a dream come true for every young boy and precisely why watching this movie is such an enjoyable experience.  Recently my wife and I sat down to watch this movie again and she told me she felt the movie was horrible.  I sat there with this blank stare and she said that she doesn't know why she ever liked the movie in the first place. Again, I resort back to my initial quote.  This is a dream come true for every `young boy' and that dream never dies; that is why even as adults a man can thoroughly enjoy this film.<br /><br />I won't say that woman cannot; but I think it has a totally different meaning to the male gender.<br /><br />This may be Steven Spielberg's finest film, and it possibly serves as one of the greatest films of all time.  It is certainly the greatest science fiction movie I've ever seen.  The wonderful thing about `E.T.' is that it becomes a part of the audience; a major part.  It's one of those films that invests itself in your heart; tapping into your emotions and reaching that inner person.<br /><br />It's a film that truly feels like a dream come true.<br /><br />When the film opens our heart is immediately touched when we see the oddly shaped E.T. running for his life as he watches his family leave him behind.  E.T. is lost, here on planet earth, with no where to run.  When he meets young Elliott, the two bond instantaneously over similar situations.  Young Elliott is struggling to adjust in a broken home; his father having recently walked out on his mother, and so both feel almost trapped.<br /><br />They find escape in their oddly matched friendship, and we find escape in watching that friendship grow.<br /><br />One of the beautiful things that propels `E.T.' into the catalogues of greatness is the sincerity of it all.  Young Henry Thomas is just a wonderment here; capturing every genuine feeling and emotion that anyone in his predicament would be feeling; from a nervous fear to an ecstatic curiosity to sympathy and love.  In fact, the entire cast captures those emotions beautifully.  Drew Barrymore gives a very solid performance as Elliott's equally captivated sister Gertie.  She exudes this warmth and spontaneity that just makes her so infectious.  There is a scene towards the end where her genuine concern for E.T.'s survival is exhibited in her outburst of tears; a scene that is so moving thanks to her connection to the material.  Both of these young actors give awards worthy performances here.<br /><br />It's no wonder that this movie became an instant hit and has remained a favorite of many even today.  It's such a beautifully told story; complete with a well written script, stellar performances and a very steady hand by Spielberg.  He crafts a sheer masterpiece here; no ifs, ands or buts about it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Uneasy The Head That Wears The Crown" Henry IV, part 2"></head><body><p>"Go ahead, admit it. Between the kerchiefs and the corgis, the sensible clothes and the semi-detached smile, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II has never been mistaken for the most dramatic monarch in the world, never given much of a hint that there might be a Major Motion Picture in her life. But this immovable object has met the unstoppable force that is actress Helen Mirren, one of the great masters of modern screen acting. In a commanding performance that is as compelling as it is unexpected, she has turned "The Queen" into something you never imagined it could be: a crackling dramatic story that's intelligent, thoughtful and moving."<br />Kenneth Turan<br /><br />Helen Mirren is extraordinary. Not only does she have the ability to take on the appearance of Elizabeth II, The Queen, she is able to reveal in small bits and pieces the humanity of Elizabeth II. Helen Mirren has said that in portraying a living person she imagines that person as a masterpiece painting. She is then able to take the brush and paint as she sees fit.<br /><br />The underlying story is the week the 'People's Princess', Diana dies. Tony Blair, as played by Michael Sheen, has been elected the new Prime Minister. Sheen's performance is sensational. He msut tell The Queen that she is mishandeling the death of Diana. At their first meeting the Queen has reminded Mr Blair, he is her tenth Prime Minister, and he needs to live up to the likes of Winston Churchill. And, this becomes Prime Minister Tony  Blair's fulfilling moment. Diana and The Queen had always been at odds. The Queen wore her emotions tightly locked up  and Diana wore her emotions on her sleeve.  Prince Phillip, as played by James Cromwell is aloof and distant and has no regard for the ex-Princess at all. The ploy to stay in Scotland at Balmoral Castle, for the children's sake does not work. The  public is clamoring for some statement from the Queen.  The Queen asks advice of the Queen mother played by Sylvia Syms, but she, too,has a stiff upper lip. Prince Charles, Alex Jennings, a more modern man, asks Tony Blair to speak to the Queen to provide a statement that is befittng the Princess.  A statement is prepared, but we can see the Queen has some misgivings. The public responds to the Queen's words.<br /><br />"Helen Mirren's allure lies not in finding what's regal in every woman she plays, but in finding what's womanly in every royal." Entertainment Weekly<br /><br />I loved almost everyone in this movie. Prince Phillip not as much.  It was riveting at times and so revealing of the Monarchy that does not, can not, reveal its private nature. The movie is funny and touching in ways you can't predict. Stephen Frears as director, has completed a beautifully moving film, rich in detail. He uses real footage of the funeral and of Diana. We are finally allowed to see the real dignity in the Queen. The current state of the world is referenced when the Queen reminds Tony Blair that the 'people can turn',"one day, quite suddenly, the same thing will happen to you."  I will never look at the real Queen Elizabeth II the same way again after seeing Helen Mirren's portrayal. This may be the greatest gift Elizabeth II could have received.<br /> Highly Recommended. prisrob 5-3-07<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FO0AHO">Elizabeth I</a> DVD<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXGA">High Fidelity</a> DVD</p></body></html>

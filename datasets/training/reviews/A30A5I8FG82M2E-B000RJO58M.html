<meta name="summary" content="Whiney and atrocious if you don't mind me saying"></head><body><p>I thought this was a pretty lousy comedy and that is coming from someone who did enjoy "Shaun of the Dead" - and if you're about to tell me that this movie isn't the same as that one, well you got that right buster.  "Hot Fuzz" is almost like attending a boring work seminar compared the party of "Shaun of the Dead".<br /><br />Maybe I'm not the target audience because I either didn't see many of the action/cop movies that "Hot Fuzz" references - and in most cases that I did see one, I don't remember it well enough.  Those movies are fun to watch because they are over the top and everything, but I don't see much point in making a movie that constantly references them.  I'd rather go back and re-watch movies like "Point Blank" or the Lethal Weapon series than watch another movie who's jokes depend on how well you have those earlier movies memorized.  I don't - and if the same goes for you, I say avoid this one.<br /><br />And oh yeah, how could I almost forget to mention - there is no reason for this movie to be two hours long, it seems to go on and on forever.  There are at least three separate climaxes, each one feeling like the movie is mercifully coming to an end.  What's the point in spoofing something if in the process you end up becoming just like your subject of ridicule?</p></body></html>

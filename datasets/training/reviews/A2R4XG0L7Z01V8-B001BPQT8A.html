<meta name="summary" content="Scary?! Only if you're a kid"></head><body><p>I originally watched this film a few years ago, and found it too terrifying, and vowed never to watch it again. The ending was the main part that freaked me out. I bought it on DVD for Christmas and decided to take a chance and watch it again. To my surprise, I found it less scary, more enjoyable, and I didn't remember any of it. I'd obviously blocked a lot of it out!<p>There are a lot of clich&eacute;s in this film. The old cop near retiring partnered with the young cop, with a thirst for blood; you know something's going to happen to the young couple who look into each others eyes lovingly - especially when the wife can't find the right moment to tell her husband she's pregnant - and the fact it seems to be constantly raining. It always seems to be raining in cop films, which makes the film even darker. <p>All of the actors do a great job. Morgan Freeman is his usual self, never smiling, although it was great to hear him laughing in this film - I don't think I've ever heard that before. Brad Pitt was looking rather fine in this, especially when he got rained on. Gwyneth Paltrow was pretty and rather underused and there was some unusual chemistry between her and Brad - considering they were dating around this time. <p>This film isn't for the faint-hearted. I didn't find it as scary second time round, although I had a cushion handy just in case. OK, it's a story about murders based on the seven deadly sins - gluttony, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy and wrath. So prepare yourself for the unexpected! Look out for the lust murder, as I found that to be the worst of the seven. Any female out there will be wincing, crossing her legs, and never wanting to let a guy near her again! Ouch to say the least. <p>This film will leave you guessing right up until the last minute - and at just two hours long, that's a lot of minutes to be guessing who the killer is! It's a good film, although I couldn't watch it more than once. Maybe again in another couple of years, and I haven't been refusing to watch it because of the ending which wasn't what I remembered/imagined it to be!</p></body></html>

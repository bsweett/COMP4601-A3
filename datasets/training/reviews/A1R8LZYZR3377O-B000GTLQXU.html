So, my anticipation was naturally at a peak when I was finally going to see a hopeful intergration of filmaking. I knew modern effects would be outstanding without even seeing it. I dont know why many of the reviews are putting an enphasis on that as if it wasnt expected. Yes, the old school acting was missing. There was passion in trying to escape, but the interaction of confusion, anger and pure uncertainty was not present. Fortunately, the level of fear was maintained solidly to somewhat compensate. I wasnt expecting a duplicate of the original, but a few more connections would have been nice along with a cameo or trivia point. The charactors where very thin and I believe the movie was way to short. The onset of the wave came too fast and much development was lacking in relation to the captain and his crew. Finding others in another area of the ship would have added to the film, with their eventual peril of course. Richard Dreyfus shaking off a passenger from his leg was a frightening touch, but I feel is a reflection of our current society. When "Chris" says to his girl , "I need you to tell me you love me", I thought I was watching acting from Night of the Living Dead, very empty. I thought the film was a bit overly dark at times. On the plus side the film started to get a good feel to as the water rushed in. Looking at the flipped ship was spectacular and realism took hold watching the constant electrical problems. The sound was awesome(if you have a good system). In a big scope way I was pulled in enough to enjoy the excitement . Filmmaker Peterson needed to realize that there was more then the rush to escape from the original. The rush was there and well done, but that extra of feeling the charactor and his bitterness was near nil. Works on some levels, refer to my title.</p></body></html>

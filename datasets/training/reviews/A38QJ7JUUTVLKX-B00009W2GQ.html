This is where they answer all the questions, they explain what Neo's purpose is, and then they fill in the time buy showing off some truly amazing special effects, and the greatest fight scene since Yoda's fight from Star Wars: Episode 2. Wow this was what I was hoping for, a big showdown. They were also realistic on how the machines and humans made peace, because there was no way that the small army of humans could have defeated the sentinel army. NONE WHAT SO EVER! So the first Matrix film introduced the characters and the situation, and the goal of the humans, the second one added more plot and more questions and was much more fast paced and allowed us to see samples of "the one's" power, and the third one gives us the biggest and coolest battle, possible in the hystory of cinema. I personally didn't think any of the matrix films were hard to follow or mentally stimulating, but I found them awesome! Yes there's opening for a Matrix 4, and I'm sure, even though they said they wouldn't, will make another to cash in and capitalize in the sucess, but then again who wouldn't?</p></body></html>

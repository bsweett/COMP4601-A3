<meta name="summary" content="One Mean Goalie..."></head><body><p>The third installment is the one "Friday" fans remember the most, because this is where Jason gets his trademark hockey mask. a group of teenagers decide to spend the weekend at one of there parents' summer cabin, that is right adjacent to... yup, you guessed it, Crystal Lake Campgrounds. This is the first "Friday" film that I saw (in 1984...on VHS...as a new release...I feel soooo old, right now) & its still one of my favorites. <p>Dana Kimmell, who plays Chris, is married w/ kids & has a strong Mormon background. She hasn't done any sort of acting since 1990 but, she might return to acting in the future. Paul Kratka, who plays Rick, practices Chiropratics in California (source - www.fridaythe13thfilms.com).<p>As for the DVD, there isn't much hope. 2.0 Dolby Digital with no special features ("Paramount Home Video" knows its going make money off the strong fan base to these films, so, the studio threw the films out to the public for a quick buck. Thanks for almost nothing).</p></body></html>

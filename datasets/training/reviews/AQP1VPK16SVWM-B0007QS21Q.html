<meta name="summary" content="Enjoyable homage to Asimov's stories"></head><body><p>First let's get the obvious out of the way from the start; "I Robot" although it incorporates elements from some of Asimov's Robot stories has little to do with the short story collection of the same name beyond the character of Dr. Susan Calvin. In fact, "I Robot" began as a homage to Asimov and an original screenplay entitled "Hardwired". When director Alex Proyas ("Dark City", "The Crow") became involved things changed and the screenwriter incorporated more elements of Asimov's stories from the collection once Fox acquired the rights to the title. The only true adapation of Asimov's stories was done by Harlan Ellison in his marvelous unproduced screenplay of the same name.<br /><br />"I Robot" has all the right elements for a great Science fiction/mystery film and, although it doesn't achieve the greatness Proyas so clearly was shooting for, he and the writers on the film have done an admirable job at creating a fun bit of entertainment.<br /><br />Chicago Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) investigates the murder of Dr. Alfred lanning (James Cromwell)at U.S. Robotics. Spooner, who detests and doesn't trust robots (an idea borrowed perhaps from Asimov's novel THE CAVES OF STEEL). All leads point to a robot named Sonny (Alan Tudyk) as the murderer. Dr. Susan Calvin (a character from Asimov's "I Robot" short stories played by Bridget Moynahan)doesn't believe its possible for Sonny to have killed Dr. Lanning as it would violate one of the Three Laws of Robotics ingrained in every robot as a moral compass or conscience. When machines mysteriously try and kill Spooner and Lawrence Robertson the head of U.S. Robotics tries to kill the case Spooner is building, he becomes suspicious and does some digging discovering far more than he expected about why the murder occurred and who killed Lanning.<br /><br />Visually stunning, Proyas film captures some of the flavor of Asimov's stories although it seems most indebted to Phillip K. Dick's stories and novels (as was Proyas film "Dark City") that deal with androids that develop self awareness. Smith gives a solid convincing performance while Moynahan's performance as Susan Calvin brings life to a character that is sketchy in the screenplay. Nevertheless, the director has created a stylish, involving action film perfect as escapist entertainment. Although the subplot involving Spooner's "racism" regarding robots was a bit heavy handed, it works creating a character that's suspicious of the "good intentions" of robots.<br /><br />The DVD looks particularly good although I'm a bit mystified as to why it wasn't released as a two disc set here as it was in other regions of the world. Because all the extras are are on the same disc as the movie, there are more compression artifacts that one might expect resulting in picture quality a grade or two below what one might expect from a movie like this. Overseas, the film had only the film and multiple commentary tracks on one disc with the extras on a second disc (with many more than the ones included here). My guess is that Fox will release a "Special Edition" somewhat down the road to double dip the fans like many other companies have been doing.<br /><br />The extras are solid if unspectacular with a glimpse behind-the-scenes and into how the FX were created for the movie. Again, more could and should have been done. The packaging with the seep through plastic sleeve is clever.<br /><br />Although the film doesn't quite live up to the hype generated by the terrific trailers Fox used to sell the film, "I Robot" is an engaging, interesting murder mystery with some nice twists and elements from Asimov's stories thrown in for good measure.</p></body></html>

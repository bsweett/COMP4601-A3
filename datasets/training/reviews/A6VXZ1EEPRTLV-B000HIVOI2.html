Scientist and linguist Daniel Jackson (James Spader) is an eccentric expert in hieroglyphics enlisted into a secret US Government project.  His task, to translate the wring on an ancient stone tablet, the directions how to access the stargate.<br /><br />Spader is perfect as a sniffling, nearsighted, academic type who seems bewildered at times, by the real world.  His natural brilliance provides the means to get the stargate working.  The first humans to attempt to use the stargate, will be an armed military unit, led by Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell).  They will perform a recon mission at wherever the stargate leads to.  Jackson goes along to make sure they group can return from the other side.  The team heads through the stargate, and pop out through a similar stargate in another world.  They find themselves inside a huge stone pyramid in the middle of a desert.  Jackson can't get the team back to Earth without additional information, so further exploration of the planet becomes necessary, and the party from Earth, eventually discovers a band of less advanced desert dwellers. <p>All this is fine, rather credible and interesting.  The interaction and learning process between the two peoples is naturally awkward.  Where things start to go off track is when the supernatural element is introduced.  "Ra" the ancient Egyptian sun god, is turned into an alien, in order to facilitate a "battle for the planet".  The charm and warmth begins to fade, and the story morphs into something we've seen before.  An interesting and provocative concept just goes to waste, and James Spader's excellent performance is somewhat obscured by his dubious transition from bookworm to fighter.  Stargate misses an opportunity to be something special.  <p>A few other items to mull over.  The story is set in a desert, but the heat must not be very intense, and never really seems to bother anyone, from the soldiers in dark uniforms, to the guys with the gigantic headgear who should be ready to faint.  The Earth soldiers initially found the desert people at work, after Jackson was dragged by a desert beast.  He should have been roasted like a hot dog by the hot sand.  And how about those desert people, toiling in the heat, then travelling across the desert, apparently not even carrying any water.  At one point, Jackson eats a candy bar, and later offers one as a gift, but in neither instance has the chocolate melted in the heat.  The small team from Earth apparently brought enough weapons with them to arm the entire planet.  That's good, because the "primitive" native kids handle firearms like combat veteran commandos.  And why, like so many other movies, do the interior sets look so sterile and fake.  Thousands of years later, and Ra and his band still dress like ancient Egyptians?  Talk about a time warp.  Who or what is flying the craft that attack the desert people?  Robots, or does Ra do pilot training too?  <p>David Arnold's music does a good job of making some of the mundane scenes seem exciting.  If you don't expect too much, Stargate will suffice as an evening's entertainment.  Something to watch, and then immediately dismiss.  You won't however, be able to watch the regular edition DVD, without at least getting up once to flip the disc over to side B. That's right, the disc needs to be flipped over</p></body></html>

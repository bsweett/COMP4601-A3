<meta name="summary" content="Lose Danny Glover on this one"></head><body><p>Mark Wahlberg was great. The plot was far-fetched. Danny Glover is absolutely obnoxious with those braces on, and mis-cast as the bad-guy heavy (unbeknownst to Wahlberg). The technical jargon for snipers was very real and accurate. If you can ignore Glover in this, it's pretty entertaining despite the aforementioned far-fetched plot. Still a very good action movie with lots of shooting.</p></body></html>

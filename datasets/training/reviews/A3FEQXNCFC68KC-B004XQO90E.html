It's Sliders mixed with Murder on the Orient Express. It's The Matrix mixed with Journeyman. You get so many variations on what people find in the movie but they all come down to a decisive trend in everybody's minds. Source Code cannot be easily defined in relation any single movie made prior. The best anybody can do is grab pieces of other films to best describe the experience they had. And you know what? They are all correct.<br /><br />Source Code is part science fiction, part mystery, part thriller, part love story, part action film and for some there are even more aspects. Even worse the science fiction side can also be considered part Twilight Zone, part time travel, part alternate realities, and even part theoretical science. In other words this movie defies a lot of standard conventions and gives you an experience you will not ever have had from any movie before it.<br /><br />The basic premise of the film is a man in the military is going back in time to find out who planted a bomb on a train in order to prevent and even worse bombing. He only has eight minutes each time he goes back. This setup opens up a whole intricate mess of subplots and developing stories. First the soldier (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) tries to get a handle on what happened to him. Then he tries various techniques in gathering clues on who the bomber is. Then he gets emotionally involved. It gets even more interesting from there.<br /><br />The story evolves in a way that is both fast paced and well developed at the same time. Gyllenhaal's character gets new revelations and the movie switches lanes each time seamlessly. I swear this film could have been retooled as a miniseries it covers so many different poignant elements, yet the pacing still feels comprehensive in it's movie length running time instead of rushed. This is a rare ability for a film and Director Duncan Jones really hits the nail on the head with it.<br /><br />The sci-fi aspects are understated. Other than seeing the inside of a contraption and the zap back into time the movie uses science fiction as only a vehicle to move into the more interesting film aspects like the mystery and detective work of finding the bomber, the suspense of wondering what will happen, and the thrills when things start falling into place. It's more of a real world kind of film from there.<br /><br />Production is very well done. Special effects are relegated mostly to the background with notable exceptions on the time travel and train explosions (which are done with a more creative dramatic effect than just seeing things go boom). Acting is quite good all around. This isn't much of a drama so nobody is really being pushed on their acting chops. There is a nice bit of emotion on the final act so don't count this movie out in that area either.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray release will be presented in 5.1 DTS-HD audio and will just a few extras. Looks like the Blu-Ray will essentially have same stuff that's going to be on the DVD. Only presented differently. Here's what's been announced so far:<br /><br />Audio Commentary - With director Duncan Jones, writer Ben Ripley and star Jake Gyllenhaal. From hearing Duncan Jones in other commentaries and interviews I am looking forward to his input.<br /><br />Access: Source Code - This is an interactive 'feature' tied to specific scenes in the movie. It will include cast interviews, scientific commentary on time travel, trivia and other tidbits. Some sources are claiming this stuff will be on a separate menu as well, but the cover photos I have seen only mention this picture-in-picture version only. Kind of bugs me if that's true. The DVD will have this stuff on separate menus only.<br /><br />Source Code is a very well made movie that turns whatever genre you feel it best fits in on its ear. It's both complex and easy to follow with a great mix of action, thrills and emotions that would seem to please just about every viewer. Watch this movie. You'll thank me for it.</p></body></html>

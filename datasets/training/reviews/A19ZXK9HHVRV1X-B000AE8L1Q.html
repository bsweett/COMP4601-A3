<meta name="summary" content="Allen makes this film her own"></head><body><p>Joan Allen has one of her juiciest roles to date in "The Upside of Anger," playing the neurotic mother of four daughters whose life is shattered when her husband leaves her for another woman.  Like Aurora Greenway in "Terms of Endearment," Terry seems to have been put on this earth to drive her children crazy.  Yet, Terry also has reserves of strength, wisdom and common sense that can come into play when she isn't downing a pint of whiskey or trying to run the lives of everyone around her.<br /><br />"The Upside of Anger," though it deals with serious issues of abandonment and resentment (and anger, of course), is, essentially, a warmhearted comedy that has some wise and witty things to say about the complexities of mother-daughter relationships.  Terry has high expectations for each of her girls, so, naturally, she is a bit disconcerted when one of them chooses not to go to college and another hides the fact that she is pregnant and engaged to a man Terry has never even heard of let alone met.  The screenplay by writer/director Mike Binder explores the tensions between Terry and her various daughters without ever becoming trite and predictable along the way.  It's true that there could have been a bit more differentiation in the character of the four sisters; sometimes it's a little hard to tell who is who or what each of their particular goals or motivations are.  But that's a minor complaint when the movie, as a whole, is so insightful and witty about so many aspects of life.<br /><br />Conjuring up memories of "Field of Dreams" and "Bull Durham," Kevin Costner returns to form in a low-keyed, understated performance as Denny, an ex pro-ball player and neighbor who develops romantic feelings for Terry.  A fellow alcoholic, he manages to bring his own share of complications and baggage into Terry's already stressful life.  (Denny serves a function very similar to the one provided by Jack Nicholson in "Terms of Endearment").<br /><br />As fine as the other actresses portraying her daughters are, this is clearly Allen's film (and she has never looked as beautiful as she does here).  She brilliantly conveys the many moods of a conflicted woman without ever once going over the edge or stepping out of character.  She sinks her teeth into the role and never lets go.  It's a virtuoso performance from one of the finest screen actresses of our time.<br /><br />The film ducks more than one potential "chick flick" clich&eacute; in its search for the truth (even avoiding what would have been a major and truly disastrous parallel to "Terms of Endearment").  The movie itself could have used a little more clarification at times, but Allen's glowing performance makes the whole thing worthwhile.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Spidey's Back"></head><body><p>Spiderman is back and better than ever in this highly-charged, thrilling sequel to the original.  Tobey Maguire reprises his role as Peter Parker and the web-slinging superhero.  A normal, but somewhat geeky college student, Parker springs into action as Spiderman at the first sign of danger. Kirsten Dunst is back as Mary Jane Watson.  At the end of Spidey one, Mary Jane and Peter told each other that they were in love, but Peter said that he could never be with Mary Jane.  She is now a highly successful Broadway actress who has fallen in love with an astronaut who happens to be the son of J. Jonah Jameson, the editor of the Daily Bugle.  James Franco stars as Harry Osborn.  He has taken over contol of his father's business after his death in the first movie.  (His father was the Green Goblin in Spidey 1).  Harry blames his father's death on Spiderman and vows to avenge his father by destroying Spiderman.  His company has developed a way to improve the fusion process, and with the cooperation of Dr. Otto Octavius, played by Alfred Molina, they have developed a strange set of titanium tentacles that can be controlled by the brain of the person wearing them.<br /><br />However, something goes terribly wrong during a demonstration, and Dr. Octavius is forever changed as a result.  Somehow, the arms seem to have taken control of Dr. Octavius, and he is now under their power.  Determined to complete his research, Dr. Octavius turns to crime and becomes known as Doc Ock, due to his similarity to an octupus.<br /><br />Soon, Doc Ock and Spiderman are fighting it out, waging battles in banks and on top of speeding commuter trains.  Ock realizes that he needs money to complete his research, so he visits Harry and makes a deal; Ock will kill Spiderman and Harry's company will give Ock the funding he needs to finish his research.<br /><br />Will Ock succed in his devious plan to finish his fusion research and possibly destroy New York City in the process?  Will Spiderman stop him before its too late?  Will Peter and Mary Jane get together?  Will Harry succeed in his bid to destroy Spiderman?<br /><br />I thought Spidey 2 was much better than the original.  The actors, especially Alfred Molina, give excellent performances, and the action and thrills are non-stop.  The ending of the movie is left wide-open for a possible Spidey 3.  I highly recommend this fun and action-packed movie.  Watch closely and keep an eye out for your friendly neighborhood Spiderman.</p></body></html>

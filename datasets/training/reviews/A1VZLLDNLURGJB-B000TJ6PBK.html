<meta name="summary" content="1408 - Great Flick!"></head><body><p>1408 was a great horror flick that deserves an unconditional four stars. The story was transferred to the screen beautifully and the film was a great screen adaptation from the King story.  No sex, no (excessive) violence, just pure Stephen King horror. It did drag a bit as it approached the ending, but kept my interest throughout. Needless to say, Cusack and Jackson were superb!  I think you will love it.</p></body></html>

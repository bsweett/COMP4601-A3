Its predominately female cast and a virtual lack of sex and nudity are also quite unusual in films of this type. Yes, it does have a few horrific murder scenes that would have gotten the film an X rating (this Anchor Bay DVD is unrated and uncut). But the majority of the film takes the "high road" in horror film-making -- rather than drenching you with blood and guts and wall-to-wall violence, it stirs up creepy atmosphere, builds up suspense, and punctuates them with shocks that are created with originality and brilliance.<p>The DVD's THX-certified video transfer is SUPER, with sharp picture, rich colors, and fine details. The Dolby Digital and DTS English surround soundtracks are clean and strong, but channel separations are sometimes quirky. There are no subtitles of any language. But it does have English closed captioning. <p>Anchor Bay released 60,000 copies of the 3-disc Limited Edition, which includes a second DVD of a new 52-minute documentary, and a music CD of the movie's music soundtrack. The documentary is essentially a collection of interviews of the cast and crew, who talk about the conception of the film ("Snow White" was an inspiration), the score, the style of the film, and their favorite scenes and anecdotes. The first disc contains the other extras: 2 trailers, 3 radio spots, 1 TV spot, about 100 stills, a music video of the movie's theme music performed by Daemonia, and bios of the director, writer, and star. There is also a 30-page DVD booklet containing an essay on the film and an interview with star Jessica Harper. Also included are replicas of eight of the production stills.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A few creepy moments but no sleepless nights with this remake"></head><body><p>The family that now owns the house in Amityville at what was once 112 Ocean Avenue (but now has a different number) have changed the infamous quarter-moon windows in the attic to regular shaped windows to ward off tourists. For that matter, I understand the house in Tom Rivers, New Jersey that was used in the original movie version of "The Amityville Horror" changed those windows as well. I find this interesting because without those "eye" windows I do not think this would have ended up being the most famous haunted house in America. Of course, the half-moon windows on the house were pretty small and in both Hollywood versions they end up being a lot bigger, but then you know what happens when movies get made.<br /><br />They still tell us that "The Amityville Horror" is "Based on a True Story," but we now know enough about the writing and selling of Jay Anson's book to know that if the label belongs on this film then it belongs on movies like "Troy" because, hey, Homer wrote non-fiction too. But in the wake of "The Blair Witch Project" there is nothing wrong with a good hoax. Besides, this 2005 version of "The Amityville Horror" is the best movie ever made with that title, which includes the 1979 version with James Brolin and Margot Kidder, and all of its wretched sequels. But that does not mean that first time feature director Andrew Douglas (who made the documentary "Searching for the Wrong-Eyed Jesus") is a truly satisfying horror film and the "history" of the house really does not give this movie a free pass on the willing suspension of disbelief. I watched this with all the lights out after midnight and had no problems sleeping, which is not the response the producers of this remake intended to be sure.<br /><br />The story is that in 1974 Ronald Defeo (Brendan Donaldson) took a rifle and killed everybody else in his family claiming that voices in the house told him to do so. The spookiest thing about the real murders was that all of the victims were shot in their beds from behind apparently without any of them waking up. But the script by Scott Kosar (who also wrote the remake of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre") starts improving on reality at this point by having Ronald kill his youngest sister, Jodie (Isabel Conner), last in the closet of her attic bedroom. You might remember from the original movie and/or book that Jodie was the name of the pig from hell, but this time it is a little girl with a bullet hole in her forehead (hang on, because this is going to be one of those good things/bad things). When George (Ryan Reynolds) and Kathy Lutz (Melissa George) move into the house, the youngest of her three children, Chelsea (Chlo' Grace Moretz) and Jodie become friends. But after 28 days in the house, the Lutz family will flee for their lives.<br /><br />For me Jodie is the pivotal character because of the way she changes the whole equation. We know going into this movie that this is a haunted house and that there are malevolent ghosts. We thought that maybe they were the ghosts of the dead Indians buried beneath the house, but that really does not matter to what is going on in the film. But Jodie is a much more recent ghost and it appears that she might actually be a good ghost and not a bad ghost. After all, in what is my favorite scene in the film, Jodie pays back the evil, wicked, bad, mean and nasty babysitter (Rachel Nichols) who delights in telling Billy (Jesse James) and Michael Lutz (Jimmy Bennett) about the murders. However, this film does not know what to do with the idea that there is a new ghost in there with the old ghosts, although that is clearly behind the film's final "boo!" right before the end credits.<br /><br />Ultimately, the horror here is not the house but what it does to George Lutz, and although the special effects are greatly improved this time around, the creepiest moments belong mostly to George, especially when he has an ax in his hands. In retrospect, everything that I liked about this film is something that Kosar came up with, and not from Anson's book, Sandor Stern's earlier screenplay, or any of the myriad stories the Lutzs have been telling over the years. But far too often Douglas relies on the old standard of a character turning around to be surprised by another character standing right, and you can only do that so many times before it becomes annoying. There are also some montages that will remind you of a Nine Inch Nails music video, however the cumulative effect is that this movie is going through a bag of tricks rather than telling a coherent haunted house story. The performances and special effects are much better here, but in terms of a coherent narrative the 1979 version would actually have the advantage, and that is not a good thing.</p></body></html>

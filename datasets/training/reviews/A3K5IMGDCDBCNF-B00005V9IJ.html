<meta name="summary" content="The Ultimate Hanks Movie"></head><body><p>Tom Hanks is simply amazing.  Director Robert Zemeckis(Forrest Gump) and Hanks have combined again and succeeded again.  <p>The film opens with Hanks, a Federal Express employee, in Russia drilling the Fed Ex employees there about better time management.  His job for Fed Ex apparently takes him all over the place and leaves little time for his girlfriend played by Helen Hunt.  Another assignment takes him off and while trying to avoid a storm the plane crashes.  This is where the movie really gets going.  Hanks lands on an island and finds himself completely alone.  This turns out to be quite a compelling character study as he tackles the most basic of needs while trying to keep hope.  Four years pass and Hanks is still there and he finally decides to leave.  Unfortunatly as the previews showed us he makes it and then...<p>Since Zemeckis decided to let the audience know ahead of time that Hanks is saved the only real suspense is whether or not he will get Hunt back.  This does not really matter because the film is good one way or another.  Hanks is brilliant.  Very few actors could tackle a project like this and still keep it interesting and engaging, especially for as long as he does in this film.  The island is definatly the best part of this movie and the rest is not as compelling.  However it is a fantastic character study and one of the best films of the year.</p></body></html>

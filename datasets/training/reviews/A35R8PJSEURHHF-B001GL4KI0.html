It is so similar to aeon flux...heroine does mission but during mission the bad guys and good guys become unclear....blah.  Fight scenes consisted of her twirling and dancing around while hundreds of bullets sprayed around her, never hitting her.  She changed hair color for what reason? The annoying mute kid accompanied her through the movie, much like so many other annoying mute kids in movies (the new x-men, etc....) Not worth the time.</p></body></html>

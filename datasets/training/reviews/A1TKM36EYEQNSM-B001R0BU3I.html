<meta name="summary" content="Traitor - a passionate Don Cheadle movie that should have gotten more attention"></head><body><p>You have to wonder if Cheadle is making more and more movies that he has a passion for the message?  Thinking Hotel Rwanda and Traitor.<br /><br />In this movie, you are left to question where he is coming from.  To whom is he a traitor to?  Is he a traitor at all?<br /><br />What you get is a sense of the good side of Islam. Cheadle quotes the Quran through the movie, even quoting the opposite views that extremists quote.  My favorite:  "Mohammed said, 'if you kill one man, you kill all of humanity.""  Wow, how powerful.<br /><br />What I like about this movie juxtaposed against movies like 'Body of Lies' or 'Syriana' is that you see Cheadle and the men who are trying to catch him.  Not a lot of back and forth and three story threads at one time.  This movie is one straighforward, intense story.<br /><br />Cheadle is one great actor, he is believable.  You like him, even when he is playing the 'enemy.'  It is a movie that reflects courage and in this confusing world we live in, gives us a sense of balance that must be sought out as we relate to our fellow man.</p></body></html>

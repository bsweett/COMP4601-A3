<meta name="summary" content="Worth watching"></head><body><p>This movie started out like many action/hostage movies I've seen, but as it progressed, there were some original situations. I like the 'saved by the dog' twist that comes in an unexpected way. Overall, this is worth watching though some might be reminded of other suspense flicks they've seen with a similar plot. Keep watching...there are some unique parts.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></body></html>

It is one of the best suspense thrillers since "Seven" and "The Silence Of The Lambs"! I mean that with personal consideration for the film. It is inventive, well-executed, and, also, well-budgeted, as its production budget cost $1 million to make the movie and it is one of the best-looking movies this year. The story revolves about two men trapped in an old bathroom. Dr. Lawrence Gordon, played by Cary Elwes, is an oncologist. Adam, played by Leigh Whannell, is an photographer. Lawrence figures out that a serial killer named Jigsaw, that was involved with an murder investigation run by Detective David Tapp, played by Danny Glover and his partner, Detective Steven Sing, played by Ken Leung. Jigsaw has, somewhat, kidnapped them, and Lawrence and Adam find out that they are apart of a murderous game that Jigsaw gives to the victims that he kidnaps. Lawrence, also finds out that his wife, Allison, played by Monica Potter, and his daughter, Diana, played by Makenzie Vega, has been kidnapped by the same killer, as well. Lawrence and Adam, find out that Lawrence has to kill Adam by 6:00 p.m., or else, Diana and Allison will die, as well as, Lawrence and Adam. This is one of the best independent films in recent history and of all time. It is better than "The Blair Witch Project". Cary Elwes (who was recently seen on screen this year as Edgar in "Ella Enchanted" (2004) & on tv in "The Riverman" as serial killer Ted Bundy), does an well-executed performance as Lawrence, an man wrought with hard hitting emotion. Leigh Whannell (who also wrote the screenplay and co-wrote the story with its director, James Wan), does an pitch-perfect performance as Adam. Danny Glover (well known as Roger Murtagh in the Lethal Weapon movies) is superb as Tapp. The directing by James Wan is excellent. The story by Wan and Whannell is brilliant and the screenplay by Whannell is brilliant, as well. This is the way that screenplays for suspense thrillers should be written. It is inventive and well thoughtout. The music by Charlie Clouser (a producer for the rock group Nine Inch Nails) is excellent. The casting by Amy Lippens is excellent. The cinematography by David A. Armstrong is brilliant. The film editing by Kevin Greutert is excellent. The costume design by Jennifer L. Soulages is excellent. The production design by Julie Berghoff is brilliant. The art direction by Nanet Harty is brilliant. Go see it if you want to or not. It is a great movie to watch on Halloween. I can't wait until it comes out on DVD.</p></body></html>

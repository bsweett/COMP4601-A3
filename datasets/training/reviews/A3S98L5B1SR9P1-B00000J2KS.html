<meta name="summary" content="Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange""></head><body><p>A Clockwork Orange is about a teenager named Alex, who, along with his three "droogs", participates in beating and raping helpless victims during the night. After being slapped around by Alex, and a night of the ol' "ultraviolence", the droogies decide to knock him out and leave him for the police to find. He agrees to participate in a new, yet controversial treatment that will shorten his jail sentence. When he is eventually let out, he becomes A Clockwork Orange, which is an object (or person in the case of the movie) which appears normal on the outside but is completely artificial or "mechanical" on the inside. He loathes violence, and can't defend himself, but his ex-droogs, and his victims are looking for revenge.<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick's direction is top notch as usual, as he was a perfectionist, and in my opinion, got the best from his cast, who were, and still are, excluding Malcolm McDowell, unknowns. Malcolm McDowell's performance is truly oscar worthy, and I'm surprised he didn't win. I really can't imagine any actor playing the part of Alex other than him. Even Kubrick said that if McDowell hadn't been available to play the part, then he probably wouldn't have done the movie. I also read somewhere during the "Ludivico Treatment" scene, one of his eyelids was scratched by the glazzy clips, also when they were filming the scene where Dim and Georgie were drowning him while beating him, he almost drowned because the breathing pipe in the water messed up. That's true commitment to a film, if you ask me. McDowell also became immensely afraid of eyedrops after filming the scene. There adds to the commitment - doing something so many times so as to become afraid of eyedrops. McDowell's performance in ACO is, in my opinion, one of the greatest, most underrated performances in movie history.<br /><br />As for the question, "Is this Kubrick's best?", well, I'd say 2001 is his best, but as we all know, opinions differ. In terms of greatness, it's definitely one of his best. I think it is a must-see for any film-lover of any kind.<br /><br />- Zack, 16 years old</p></body></html>

To be sure, these motifs are straight out of the writings of Sir Thomas Mallory.  However, they are also anachronisms when juxtaposed with the original myth.<br /><br />This film gets back to the roots of the myth, which date back to right around the end of the Roman occupation.  It also picks up on Arthur and his knights being descendents of Samarian knights, which is a plausible theory.  In short, the epoch portrayed in this movie served as the genesis of the legend of Arthur.  Whether or not the fellow ever actually existed is still a matter of speculation - even amongst historians with doctorates.<br /><br />David Franzoni, the writer of GLADIATOR, once again displays his erudition as he mixes historical fact with fictional details.  There are some cool special features that entice one to admire the lengths they went to in making the sets and battle scenes / battle tactics as authentic as possible.  One leaves this movie feeling as though he or she was just in the middle of 5th century (CE) Britain.<br /><br />Clive Owen is terrific as the noble Arthur. Hans Zimmer delivers yet another top-notch soundtrack.  The direction is excellent. Unfortunately, the Unrated label does not = Keira Knightley taking her shirt off.  However, she still looks very sexy in Celtic warpaint!<br /><br />One of the most refreshing factors of the film is that it does not concentrate on the love-triangle.  That this is an important part of the myth is not in dispute.  However, some versions of the tale focus on the triangle to the detriment to the rest of the myth.  In this movie, things never get past some subtle flirting between Lancelot & Guinivere.<br /><br />For fans of the legend, this movie is a can't miss. For people who desire to learn more about both British and Roman history, this movie is invaluable.  For everyone else, it's certainly worth seeing at least once.  Long Live King Arthur!</p></body></html>

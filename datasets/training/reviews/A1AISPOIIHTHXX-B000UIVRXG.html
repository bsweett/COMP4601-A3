<meta name="summary" content="4.5; finally a comedy that made me laugh"></head><body><p>That's kind of a surprising thing to hear, no? When you consider how many romantic comedies and whatnot that have been released this year, you'd think I'd have laughed more. Well, sort of. Some of them, such as Catch and Release and Because I Said So were not that funny or even charming (although I can stare at Mandy Moore all day). But now and then you see one that makes you forget all the bad ones you've seen and while it does have its flaws, Hot Fuzz is probably one of the funnier movies this year, and strangely enough, one of the better action ones too.<br /><br />Nicholas Angel is a remarkably talented police officer with exceptional skills and a strong devotion to the law. However this creates jealousy among the other London cops since he makes them look worse by comparison so they ship him off to the small town of Stanford, known for its low crime rate and multiple "Village of the Year" wins. Many in town are not too excited to have him there and friend Danny is the only one who follows him which is helpful since a number of murders have been happening. Who's behind it and can Nick get through the town's ineptitudes to solve the case?<br /><br />The last time director Edgar Wright and stars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost made a comedic film was with the surprise hit, Shaun of the Dead. Combining horror violence with comedy, it was a nice mix although at times the horror kind of overtook the comedy parts. Now they've combined comedy with action movies, namely the buddy films with 2 cop partners having to solve a case and blow stuff up too. Here, it's used to great effect and while some jokes don't work (a mumbling farmer for one) you have others that are just hysterical. I bet lot of you will start quoting the "yarp/narp" thing after watching this.<br /><br />But how about the action? Well it mainly pops up at the end and until then we get some graphic murders that while nowhere the level of Hostel (although one involving a rooftop is a doozy), the film picks up at the end where it actually becomes exciting. Imagine that: a great shootout in a comedy movie. Sacre bleu! While it does do that quick editing used by a lot of new directors. you never lose track of the events. If there's one thing that slightly takes the film down is the pacing at the beginning. While I don't mind films that take awhile for the "real stuff" to get going such as Aliens which took near an hour for the first sign of the thing to show up, here it feels kind of long.<br /><br />Acting-wise you can always rely on the group to be funny without being less than real people. Simon Pegg for instance who played kind of a well-meaning slacker in Shaun plays the serious-as-hell Nicholas and he pulls if off without being unintentionally funny. We also get cameos from Bill Nighy of Dead Man's Chest/At World's End fame, Martin Freeman of the British version of the Office, Timothy Dalton and apparently even Peter Jackson in a quick cameo.<br /><br />Funny enough, released the same day as this on DVD was 300, a movie that wanted to be an epic even though it was strictly base entertainment. But for some reason Hot Fuzz is a comedy movie that kind of becomes a bit more. It's probably not the most important comedy this year but it's surely the funniest.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One Of The Best Alien Contact Movies Ever"></head><body><p>I've always wondered why, in science fiction movies dealing with human/alien contact, the aliens are almost always the bad guys.  It's always them invading us, or us getting out there and meeting with aliens who turn out to be midlessly vicious or innately evil.  Assuming that there are probably a lot of alien civilizations in the hundred billion odd galaxies in the universe, it's not unreasonable to think that some of them will turn out to be warlike.  But we know that humans have launched wars more than occasionally, so it always seemed to me that there should be some alien invasion movies where the humans are the invaders, or some where aliens arrive at Earth and are greeted by humanity's mean side ("Alien Nation" did this quite a while back, but it was one of the few).  Also, there seemed to be missed opportunities in that in the human/alien conflicts, wouldn't there be situations where neither side was all bad or all good?<br /><br />  Well over the last year or two these very concepts have clearly gotten their day, and District 9 is one of the leaders of the pack.  While not being a totally black-or-white scenario, the human response in this first contact situation turns out not to be as noble as one would like, and disturbingly realistic with numerous real-life parralells.<br /><br />  A massive alien ship enters Earth's atmosphere and rather than hovering over a city like New York or London, ends up over Johannesberg, South Africa, in what's soon to turn out to be an unfortunate irony.  The ship is broken down, out of supplies, doesn't have the ability to communicate, and is packed with what appear to be starving refugees.  Upon the initial arrival of the ship, the whole world is excited at the prospect of contact and the dawn of a new era.  Upon the initial discovery of the aliens's sad state, the whole world is prepared to pitch in and help the hundreds of thousands of new arrivals.  Flash forward twenty years, though, and it's a far grimmer picture.  No new era has dawned with man being inducted into interstellar society or reaping the economic benefits of contact with and trade with a technologically advanced civilization.  Humanity has never figured out how the alien tech worked and was therefore never able to tap into its potential benefits.  Most of the surviving aliens, even after communication, were no more able to explain how everything functioned than the average modern human passenger on a commercial airplane would be able to tell a stone age tribe how to build their own jets.  The aliens, referred to by humans as 'prawns' (a label considered derisive by many of the aliens) apparantly can't return home, and the costs of housing and accomodating their growing population became something the world started to get tired of.  It also cost a lot to try and figure out how to work their technology, especially their weapons (of huge interest to the nations of the world) and no benefit came from that either.  So twenty years later, rather than being honored guests, the aliens are crammed into a poverty-ridden ghetto in the middle of Johannesberg in a situation that not only bears an uncomfortable resemblance to South Africa's apartheid past, but to other world situations past and present.  Humanity, once so fascinated with the aliens, is tired of them and views them as a burden.  And inside the ghetto known as 'District 9', the 'prawns' have reacted to their deprived state, their seemingly dead-end future, and the hostility of much of the world around them, in the same way humans in the same situations do: they've lost hope, they're attempting to eke out meager livings on the bottom rungs of society (salvaging human landfills for junk and scrap metal, for example), some of them have turned violent in a new prawn undersociety of alien thugs, and many of them have become substance addicts (in the aliens's case, to catfood, originally simply a cheap meal that no one anticipated would have such an addictive effect on their alien physiology).  Human society has attempted to limit the prescence of these 'undesirables' in appalingly familiar ways - confining them to their own ghetto and not letting them out, population control measures (even including forced abortions, in a highly disturbing angle), and now, finally, the time has come that Jonnasberg has decided that they want the aliens out of the city altogether and a private military contractor is preparing to move them - by force if necessary - to a camp in the desert that will be known as District Ten.<br /><br />  We see much of the movie through the eyes of Wikus Van De Merwe (a great performance by Sharlto Copley), a civilian official working with private contractor MNU, and here's part of where the movie picks up its "not black or white" status: Wikus doesn't see himself as a bad guy, or as 'anti-prawn'; he's aware that the current situation is horrid, is aware that the solution of forcible relocation has all kinds of practical and moral flaws, but seems to see it as the best available option.  He's also guilty himself on at least a couple of occasions of some horrifying actions, but he doesn't view it that way, partly because he's not relating to the alien people the way he would to human people; he actually seems to think he's doing the best thing for them. It's only when some totally unexpected events make Wikus an outsider himself, and he and some of the aliens are forced to work together, that he begins to see the brutality of their daily situation more clearly, and the cold ruthlessness of the private contactor he's been affiliated with.  Also adding to the "not black or white" angle: some of the prawns Do come off as bad guys - certain ones are beligerant, crude and violent.  If humanity was to judge the prawns ONLY on those representatives they'd have good reason to be wary.  Two obvious real-life parallels here: the folly of judging an entire group or race only by its worst members; and the fact that we're seeing the prawns After years of ill treatment.  Were the nasty ones that violent to begin with, or is it, to at least some degree, a consequence of the way they've been treated?  There's another level to the run-down state of the alien society on Earth, and this one doesn't really have real-life parallels because it's based on alien physiologies and technologies and so on.  It's not asked outright, but it's pretty clear in the subtext - did whatever happened to cripple their ship originally have some direct effect on the aliens themselves, either physically or psychologically?<br /><br />  In the first ten minutes or so of District 9, it became abundantly clear that it was a very well-done movie, but I also thought I might be in for one of the most depressing movies ever made.  It's not though.  There are tragic and melancholy parts to it, even depressing parts, but oh, there are also some parts that are just jaw-droppingly Awesome.  The movie runs the gamut through all kinds of tragedy and triumph, unexpected plot turns, characters changing their points of view both on other individuals and on whole situations, several major turning points.  The prawn aliens are very individualized, with their own personalities, temperaments, etc. - they're as much Characters as the human characters, not just a bunch of aliens where one is indistinguisable from another.  An alien named Christopher Johnson (they all have names that humans can pronounce and would be familiar with in addition to the names in their own click-language, which a number of humans can understand but none are physically capable of speaking) and his young son become major players in a series of unexpected events that also involve Wikus.<br /><br />  Highly cerebral with great action, tremendous visuals, memorable characters and high tension, District 9 is great on all levels.  Highly recommended, although certain disturbing or bloody scenes may be more than many scence fiction fans are used to.  Although really, there's no other way they could have filmed this and had it be as effective.  Recommended for all except young children.</p></body></html>

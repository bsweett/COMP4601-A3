<meta name="summary" content="A Different Kind of Stalker Movie...."></head><body><p>I had expected One Hour Photo to be yet another variation on the overused Hand That Rocks the Cradle/Fatal Attraction stalker genre, and I was glad to be proven wrong.  Rather than a film about a crazed, murderous stalker, Director Mark Romanek delivers a touching portrait of a lonely man looking for a place to fit in.<p>  Robin Williams is excellent as Sy "The Photo Guy" Parrish, who uses his job in the photo departmant of SavMart to accumulate pictures of the family he so desperately wishes to be a part of. When he discovers clues that all might not be sweetness and light with his fantasy family, Sy decides to take steps to correct things. <p>  I really didn't feel too much for the Yorkin family- Apart from the sympathetic young son, the parents aren't the nicest of people, and the secret they're hiding made me like them even less. (I did understand how Sy could be drawn to the lovely Mrs. Yorkin, played by the luminous Connie Nielson.) The ending is vastly different from what I was expecting, and that's always a plus. <p>  See it for Robin Williams' strong performance, which is sure to be a contender at Oscar time.</p></body></html>

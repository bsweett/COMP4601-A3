See, the director is Tony Scott, the guy behind 'Top Gun' and 'True Romance' which means that you cannot get round characters or anything deep in here.  To be honest, the script by Brian Helgeland (who should have slowed down his pace after 'Mystic River') is full of holes, made out of cliched set-pieces.<br /><br />However, you get real professionals here -- this time, Denzel Washington as our anti-hero Creasy, ex-government special agent how is hired for protecting a little girl 'Pita' in Mexico, where, the film claims, kidnapping became no longer an unusual event.  As this long film (2hrs 26 mins) unfolds, Creasy confronts the crime syndicate alone, who attempt a violent kidnap plan on the little girl.<br /><br />Little girl Pita is played by Dakota Fanning, who had been  incidentally a kidnapped girl in 'Trapped' before, and like that previous so-so film, she easily shows that she is just amazing among the B-action film, especially the amusing bantering humor with Denzel's Creasy, whose job, he supposes at first, doesn't include being friendly.<br /><br />After the slow-moving first half, which concentrates on the relations between the man and the girl, the latter half changes the tone in a drastic way, with the furious Creasy who is bent on revenge, or in plain words, killing.  Denzel Washington manages to get more violent -- I mean, very graphic violence -- than the cop in Oscar-winning 'Training Day,' and some of you may find what he does very questionable.  Well, but that's what Creasy does, the man on fire.<br /><br />The film scores bonus points thanks to the great supports -- Christopher Walken and Giancarlo Giannini are real standout, while Rhada Mitchell, Rachel Ticotin, and Mickey Rourke are all effective.  Believe me or not, Chris is not a bad guy.  Really.<br /><br />The film's total results are, however, hampered by its own overdone cameraworks -- fast-cutting, slow motions, double exposures, and so on and on, all of which are irritating to  us.  While we know that more traditional images would be more effective in creating the mood of the city in Mexico, the MTV style camara only prevents the actions from going on smoothly.  And those subtitles, especially the 'Time to Go' countdown is only laughable.<br /><br />I give as many as four stars simply because I didn't find the film dull all through.  But that's simply because 'Man on Fire' has superb acting from superb actors, and the fact remains that 'Man on Fire' is a well-crafted, well-acted B-action flick with excessive brutality.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Guy Fawkes Day"></head><body><p>I really like this film!<br />Natalie Portman's acting is so very good.<br />About an England where a neo-Nazi has come to power;<br />the use of fear in the classic sense has made a police state<br />possible: it reminds one very much of the current Bush administration<br />where 'security' overrides rights.<br />The prisoner/ experimental subject in cell V in an biological<br />concentration camp right out Germany at the end of WWII survives.<br />Like the X-man magneto he has abilities beyond the ordinary,<br />like seeing without eyes and strength.<br />The rescue of the young Evie changes him, but not his plan<br />to overthrow the government on Guy Fawkes Day.</p></body></html>

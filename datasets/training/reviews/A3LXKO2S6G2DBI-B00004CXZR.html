<meta name="summary" content="Not Much of An Improvement Story-Wise"></head><body><p>When &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; premiered in 1979, many fans of the original series were elated--and many more disappointed.  The problem wasn't that the film was cheap or puny in scale, nor that it hadn't finally reunited the primary &quot;Star Trek&quot; cast members, some of whom hadn't been before cameras in years.  Thanks mostly to &quot;Star Wars,&quot; sci-fi fans by then had developed a ravenous taste for big-budget space opera and because the series had become more cartoonish as the 1960s wore on anyway, they now expected something that would outdo the George Lucas shoot-em-up.  <p>What they got instead was a bold, if flawed, attempt to return things to the more serious and understated tones of &quot;Star Trek&quot;'s first season while simultaneously pushing the special effects envelope.  And though &quot;Star Trek&quot; always was space opera with harder sci-fi leanings, &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; mistakenly abandoned most of the space opera standards altogether--interstellar battles, &quot;ray gun&quot; fights, scantily-clad &quot;moon maidens,&quot; strange and menacing aliens--in favor of an approach that was more in keeping with &quot;2001:  A Space Odyssey.&quot;  The story of the revamped Enterprise's rush to stop a cloud-like entity's march toward earth became, in the end, mostly a platform for technical, not cinematic, achievement.  <p>In the years following the film's release, Director Robert Wise did not conceal his disappointment with both the movie's final cut and its critical reception, but thanks to the advent of sophisticated computer graphics, he finally got his chance to complete the film as intended two decades later.  The result is a mixed bag.  <p>Certainly, the director's cut is more streamlined than its predecessor--several edits speed up the action, and even some of Jerry Goldsmith's excellent orchestrations seem faster.  The reimagined special effects are, for the most part, an improvement (watch carefully, for instance, to see a shuttlecraft from the series depart the San Francisco port), though anyone expecting images on the order of &quot;The Matrix&quot; or the later &quot;Star Wars&quot; films will be disappointed.  (I'm guessing the technicians had to match image quality to that of the 1979 release.)  The credits definitely look better.  <p>But the major flaws of the film, including a second half that just seems to drag compared to the first, are intact.  Worse, because at least one version of the film with additional footage already shows us what is possible, some of the choices of what to cut and what to keep are questionable.  Gone are some great character moments like Kirk telling Bones to get out of his quarters and the computerized translation of the doomed Klingon captain (though some make it as deleted scenes on the bonus disk).  Perfectly adequate sound effects, too, have been replaced by others that seem tinny, and many of these effects compete rudely with Goldsmith's score.  All in all, the Director's Edition seems a tradeoff, worth viewing mostly by the diehard fan, who will also likely find the second DVD more interesting than the usual chatter and mugshots tossed into the mix.</p></body></html>

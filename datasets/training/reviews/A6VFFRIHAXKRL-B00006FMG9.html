<meta name="summary" content="Not up to par with Manhunter 5/10"></head><body><p>Now I know that Dino DeLaurntiis passed on recently this isn't ment to be mean at all but back in 1986 Manhunter flopped at the box office for whatever reason De Laurntiis said "I do not like Manhunter it is not Red Dragon." So he had no involvment with Silence Of The Lambs but when that movie was a hit he saw money so he produced the sequel which I will admit it was a decent sequel but honestly it would've been like when Hallloween III flopped when John  Carpenter & Deborah Hill stopped producing cause  everybody wanted Michael if you remember.  Then  when H4 was a sucess Carpenter & Hill decided to come back & produce the Halloween movies.<br /> A year & a half later Red Dragon was released many aren't aware that this is a remake of Manhunter based off the novel by Thomas Harris. I say watch Manhunter 1st if you haven't saw either movie. It has a huge cast a great cast great job but that's really it. Anthony Hopkins returns as Hannibal Edward Nortan plays Will Graham Ralph Fiennes as Francis Dollarhyde Harvey Kitel as Jack Crawford Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Freddy Lounds. Basically you start off "Will Graham is looking for a killer "Graham" thinks he's figured out he's dealing with a cannibal. So it can't be good "Graham" finds a book how to cook people while at his friends house Dr Hannibal Lecter. I'm thinking why wasn't this cut it is so predictable cause William Peterson talked about it in Manhunter. Both "Graham & Hannibal hurt each other we go to a few years later & FBI director "Jack Crawford" asks for "Graham's" help. so he goes looking for a killer named "The Tooth Fairy" It really does feel like most of the lines are reused from Manhunter like when Ed Nortan says a line the William Peterson delivered much better the way Norton does it & his facial expressions are too laughable. The scene where "Graham" talks to Hannibal is line for line just like Manhunter. While William Peterson was intemidated by Lecter in Manhunter cause of there history he stood his ground even Jodie Foster stood her ground Ed Norton looked like a nervous wreck like he was going to hide in corner. Were introduced to "Freddy Lounds" only it's not as cool as Manhunter. & "Francis Dollarhyde" I'm sorry compared to Tom Noonan's Dollarhyde Ralph Finnes Dollarhyde is wuss. Noonan was more interesting they mentioned his messed up life but they didn't totally dwell on it. A lot of his actions througout the movie he's begging to be caught. Finnes "Dollarhdye" is just way too cliched hearing voices & all. Tom Noonan's Dollarhyde would have no problem kicking Finnes "Dollarhye's" a  z  z.<br />I mean there is a scene where he is at this newstand the guy tells him to come back later he purchases a paper anyway looks at the guy with a threating look. Lecter giving out the Graham's address is still there "Dollarhyde" takes "Lounds" has him in that wheel chair sets him on fire & goes down the same street where that newstand was at gee that guy at the newstand could put 2 & 2 together. The Brooklyn Musem scene was a giant WTF?! The finish is different cause "Dollarhyde" makes it look like he kills himself it turns out that it is the guy that he killed in Reba's yard. Basically the movie thinks it's smart & it is pretty predictable cause a lot of the lines & scnes are used from Manhunter. Basically "Dollarhyde" shows up at The "Graham house & we get a lame duck finish.  The Ending Dr Chilton tells Hannibal that there is a lady from The FBI & Lecter says "what's her name? LOL brillant not! I know it's closer to the book then it's a s hi t  t  y  book then. Ted Tally why didn't you just make a Hannibal sequel get Jodie Foster back or even William Peterson & end it on a good note. Brett Ratner wasn't a good choice to helm a Hannibal movie. I like Rush Hour 1&2 even X3 is better. Edward Norton is a good actor but he doesn't cut it for Will Graham. It's worth watching for Anthony Hopkins. Harvey Kitel was ok but he's done better like Bad Luitenant. Ralph Fiennes is I'm not farmilar with but he didn't cut it for me. Phillip Semour Hoffman is just there. It's wathcable it's just not up to par with Manhunter. I mean if you like this movie that's fine but it's my opinion.</p></body></html>

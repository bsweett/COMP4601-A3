<meta name="summary" content="A new kind of monster movie?"></head><body><p>This movie kind of reminded me of Kafka for some reason:<br />no offense, but $200<br />for 15 minutes of being John Malkovich<br />seems over priced?<br />The acting is first rate and the script is is just kind of awesome in the way you get to hate the John Cusack character who is<br />pretty much the anti-hero of this modern surreal drama.<br />In the end I guess I liked it, but I wouldn't take kids to see it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Message is Important: Getting there is Tiresome"></head><body><p>The overall message of FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, that the most important drive in a person's life is to be 'perfect' - meaning true to one's self, always doing the best you can, being able to look your loved ones in the eye knowing you have done your best - is worth saying repeatedly.  When it comes from the mouth of Billy Bob Thornton playing the coach of a West Texas high school football team, it is eloquent.<br /><br />There is an honesty to this recreation of a true story as adapted by Peter Berg that rings true. Though the film is apparently about a football team's obsession with winning the Texas State Championship, it is more concerned with showing us the extremes such obsession drives small towns, parents, townsfolk, and even teammates into a variation of road rage.  Each of the teammates is examined and found to be the victim of too high expectations and distorted values.  It is the heart of the coach that ultimately puts winning and losing into perspective, and that moment in the locker room of the final game is superb.<br /><br />The cast is good, especially Billy Bob Thornton as the coach, but also his players Derek Luke, Lucas Black, Garrett Hedlund, Jay Hernandez, Lee Jackson,  and Lee Thompson Young.  The direction is fine except for the ever-present level of noise from the sport and from the intrusive music, jerky editing, and jumbled views of the games in action.  Not a great movie, but a fine message delivered by some very fine actors.  Grady Harp, February 2005</p></body></html>

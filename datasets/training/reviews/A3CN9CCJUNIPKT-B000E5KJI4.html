Just crack open a dictionary sometime, fercrissake...) and despite an inaccuracy or two here and there... (Didn't Ajax die after Achilles?  Like, didn't he scoop his armor up off the beach, and all that...? ) and despite the fact that hardly anyone on this film looks even remotely Greek... and despite the film giving the impression that a torturous ten-year war took place in the span of a few weeks...  Despite all that, this film was still fun, about as good a sword-and-sandal epic as we're likely to get in this day and age.  Brad Pitt, though buff as can be, perhaps isn't the greatest choice as Achilles, but Eric Bana is surprisingly moving as Hector, the champion of Troy, investing him with a tremendous pathos... The script is fairly tight, the sets look grand, the computer generated armies aren't too mechanical, the violence has heft.  In short, it works as an action film.<br /><br />That being said, the screenwriters and producers should be ashamed or at least abashed at how they distorted the Greek legends and bent history to fit their narrative scope.  The prime example of this is the melodramatic slaying of King Agamemnon at the film's climax:  Agamemnon actually returned from the Trojan War and was later slain in a palace intrigue.  His murder was the source of an entirely separate drama, and monkeying with the details of his death is a particularly egregious untruth.<br /><br />I weary of Hollywood writers who defend their despoiling of history by saying, "oh look, it's just a movie and I can write it any way I want to..." It's one thing to elide past peripheral events or omit facts that bog a story down, another thing altogether to willfully change the facts entirely.  Not only is it simply evil and wrong to rewrite history, it's just plain lazy.  They may claim that they are professionals who know how best to tell a story, but c'mon: if you can't figure out how to come up with a proper dramatic ending using the real story of "The Iliad," then you just aren't as skilled a craftsman as you'd like us to believe.  You're just a hack with a tight deadline. And in the case of the Iliad in particular, it's not "just a movie." This is probably the only version of this story -- one of the world's most important historical narratives -- that most people in our demi-literate pop culture will ever learn: couldn't you at least make the effort to get the details straight?  Is it really that hard?  Do you really gain that much dramatically by screwing up our perception of history?  Fie, a pox apon you lazy Hollywood twits.  If you can't be bothered to present history accurately, then don't choose an historical story to tell.</p></body></html>

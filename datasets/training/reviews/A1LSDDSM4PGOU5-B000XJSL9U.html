<meta name="summary" content="what a rush,but those of you who need a little bit of reality and/or logic to their action  probably won't like it"></head><body><p>this ,the 4th installment of the Die hard franchise is easily the most<br />thrilling and action packed.however,logic and reality are thrown out<br />the window for the action scenes.if you like your action with a little<br />bit of realty and logic,you won't like this movie.but for me,the movie<br />was so fun,i didn't care.but beyond being just a slam bang action<br />thrill ride it's also very relevant and thought provoking.if the<br />technology that society almost totally depend on were to completely<br />crash,how would you react,and hoe would the general public react.this<br />movie gives one hypothetical example of the answer to that<br />question.it's great to see this installment is geared more towards our<br />techno savvy contemporary audience.but it's also still great for<br />audiences that grew up with the franchise. not only is this a thrilling<br />and thought provoking movie,but it's also very funny,possibly the<br />funniest of all four movies.for me,Live Free or Die Hard is a perfect<br />5/5 for sheer excitement alone.the rest is just gravy.</p></body></html>

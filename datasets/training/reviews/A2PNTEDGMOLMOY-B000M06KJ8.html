<meta name="summary" content="Gorgeous yet empty tale of redemption for unredeemable "heroine""></head><body><p>Sophia Coppola's "Marie Antoinette," starring Kirsten Dunst, is a big old piece of cheesecake . . . it looks and tastes delicious, but eating of it too heartily will only make you sleepy and obese.  There is little or nothing of resonance in "MA," beyond some spectacular costume and set design.<br /><br />"MA" begins with our "heroine" as an innocent Austrian teenager, whisked away by geopolitics into a marriage with the Dauphin of France (Jason Schwartzman).  And so begins Ms. Coppola's "poor little rich girl" story, where she tries valiantly to redeem Ms. Antoinette and make her an object of sympathy and admiration.  Ultimately, that's a dog that just won't hunt.<br /><br />We see early scenes where the spoiled rich nobility - empty suits and dresses all - smirk behind their gloves at the uncouth Austrian princess while also imposing the most ridiculous set of rules and protocols upon her.  Judy Davis exemplifies the silliness of the French court as she sternly instructs Marie to leave her beloved dog at the Austrian border - you can have as many French dogs as you like, my dear!  All these scenes pummel us into acknowledging Marie as a sympathetic figure, and yet so far she is nothing more than an undefined teenager.<br /><br />But soon, Marie adopts the spoiled ways of her French counterparts - she shops endlessly, takes a lover (that seems to be little more than an infatuation than a soulmate), and ignores the plight of her subjects.  The fact that Marie lives in the uber-opulence of Versailles (gorgeously shot, as if it could be filmed any other way) undermines any attempt to shore up Marie's sympathetic side.  In one shocking scene, Marie is confronted with the troubles of her people - there is a horrible bread shortage.  Her response?  She makes the less-than-magnificent concession, "Tell the jeweler to stop buying diamonds."  Truly, a woman of the people.<br /><br />Much has been made of the anachronistic '80s soundtrack, and I'll add my own quibble.  The movie seems to go about it half-way.  Much of the movie comes straight out of Merchant-Ivory, with baroque music and a period feel, but occasionally a Cure tune or other '80s punk band drops in.  Coppola could have gone all-out post-modern, like Baz Luhrmann's "Romeo + Juliet," but this half-measure in unsatisfying.<br /><br />There are positives in this movie, but it is hard to come down on that side of the scale where the overarching purpose of the film - to redeem one of Europe's most glamorous villains - rings so false.  It is also unsettling that Schwartzman is given so little to do - his recent turn in "Shopgirl" shows that "Rushmore" was no fluke.  Dunst is beautiful, but her performance does not even match the intensity Madonna brought to Eva Peron in "Evita."<br /><br />And to top it off, after "Lost in Translation," I had exceedingly high expectations for Coppola's follow-up effort.  Perhaps unfairly high, but regardless, they were not met.<br /><br />Check out this movie if you are a huge fan of costume and set design, but other than that, it's worth a rental, nothing more.</p></body></html>

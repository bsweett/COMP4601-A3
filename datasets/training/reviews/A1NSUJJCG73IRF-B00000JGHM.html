<meta name="summary" content="Heat  (1995)"></head><body><p>Director:  Michael Mann<br /><br />Cast:  Al Pacino, Robert DeNiro, Val Kilmer, Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Diane Venora, Amy Brenneman, Ashley Judd, Natalie Portman, William Fichtner.<br /><br />Running Time:  171 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for violence, language, and brief sexual situations.<br /><br />Few films come along that are as extravagantly produced, perfectly performed by the cast, and emotionally draining as is Michael Mann's epic crime drama "Heat".  The film brings two of the most formidable actors of the last quarter century and juxtaposes them into a intense battle of good versus evil, right versus wrong, and life versus death.  The wonderful casting of Robert De Niro (playing the brilliant criminal Neil McCauley), and Al Pacino (playing no-nonsense detective Vincent Hanna) is perfect. What is so intriguing and entertaining about "Heat" is that it goes inside the lives of each of these men, showing us the personal feelings of Neil and Vincent, which adds much needed depth amongst all the flying bullets. We simply see their lives. It is as if we are watching two movies, about two different people, who happen to have a connection to the same crime.<br /><br />Neil McCauley (DeNiro) is one of the best expert thieves around, bearing the philosophy  become attached to nothing in life that you can't walk away from if the situation arises. His crew of criminals is a high-tech outfit pulling off professional jobs that impress even the likes of detective Vincent Hanna (Pacino). But Hanna, a man driven through life only by his work, becomes obsessed, at the expense of his private life, with bringing McCauley down. As McCauley's crew prepare for the score of a lifetime and Hanna's team tries to bring him in, the two find that they are challenged by the greatest minds on the opposite side of the law that either one has ever encountered.  While following Hanna's personal life, the movie shows how it is about more than just a cop in pursuit of a criminal. Hanna's marriage is deteriorating, his step daughter (Natalie Portman) is falling apart, and, as wife Justine (Diane Venora) says, he lives his life more among the "remnants of dead people." A man of two other failed marriages, Hanna's story is that of the strain of trying to fulfill both his professional and personal, where, every time, the professional wins out. Neil McCauley's story is that of a man who used to know his role: his job. Everything in his life revolved around making the next score (whether it be large or small). His story chronicles his relationships with the other men in his crew, and his relationship with his girlfriend who does not know all she should about him. The tensions build as Mann (who also wrote the script) shows the two opposing strategies of each man as their paths (and thus their stories) draw closer together.<br /><br />Additionally strong is Val Kilmer, as Chris Shiherlis; with a raging temper, undying devotion, and a fierce will to persevere. Kilmer does an excellent job with the character of a flawed individual, whose blemishes prevent him from lasting contentment, but against which flaws he continually strives. Ashley Judd is an unforgettable Charlene Shiherlis, who despite a smaller roll, makes a lasting impression on the film. Tom Sizemore, as the implacable Michael Cheritto, and Jon Voight, as a gruff Nate, are both likeable (because of their human sides) and despicable (because of their professions). Each does excellent work. Equally fine are Venora and Portman, while Amy Brenneman, is an equally strong companion of DeNiro.<br /><br />Michael Mann's direction of the film keeps moving while providing a tremendous combination of action and drama. He moves from scene to scene quickly and effortlessly, switching between the many storylines logically and fluidly, none of the story being lost. Each scene leaves its own, unmistakable impression, and each scene of each storyline builds upon the previous. The action scenes are handles crisply but grittily, with the gunshots loud, the blood abundant, yet Mann wisely does not linger on the horror of the moment. He paints a realistic picture, but keeps to the topic, ensuring that the action never becomes more important than the drama. Intermixing an excellent musical score by Elliot Goldenthal, Mann adds a gripping, yet soft eloquence to the picture and enhances the cinematic chess game with each and every move.  Certainly hightly-respected and stupendously well-made for the genre, "Heat" is one of the most powerful, enthralling modern crime dramas of all time.</p></body></html>

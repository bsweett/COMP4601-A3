<meta name="summary" content="By Far the Most Honest Cinematic Work To Date"></head><body><p>I happen to disagree with David Denby's review.  This is the most moving work I've ever seen; very honest depiction, detail by detail.  It's not meant to be bombastic and dreamy and glorifying.  This is what it was like for Jews during the holocaust.  The waiting.  The boredom.  The uncertainty of the next meal or the uncertainty of the next day.  Watching this movie made me understand a little more clearly the kind of treatment my African-American ancestors went through.  And after watching this movie, I would feel ashamed to waste food.  When you watch this movie, you can't help but thank God we won this one and we've never had it so good.  Congratulations to Mr. Polanksi and Adrien Brody on a job well done.</p></body></html>

The main character learns about life. There are no perfect couples and life is complex. My biggest problem is the baby. Juno had sex because she was curious and she was bored. I don't understand why they didn't have protected sex. She planned the encounter for months and she obviously knew better. They didn't have sex in the throes of passion. They had sex because they were curious.<br /><br />We follow the pregnancy's development. Juno through it all never forms an attachment to the baby. She objectifies it. She decides not to have an abortion because she was uncomfortable in the clinic and didn't like the staff. She decides to give up the baby for adoption.<br /><br />In the end there are no consequences. She is the same strange, sweet girl at the end of the movie as she is at the start of the movie. The baby is completely out her life as if nothing happened. Her father says to her at the hospital after Juno gives birth that one day she will be there on her own terms. I don't understand. She made every decision to get there in the first place. It was on her own terms. Maybe, he meant that the next pregnancy will be planned and she will want the baby. She seems depressed after the birth, but no moral misgivings and no post-partem depression. The baby is almost a Hitchcockian McGuffin. It is introduced into the plot to provide conflict.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie but maybe because I was a guy I was not overwhelmed. The one really bad thing is the music. One obnoxious song towards the beginning goes on forever with horrible lyrics and an repetitious melody. I think the song was supposed to be a duet of Juno and her boyfriend. However, there was no reason to inflict so much torture for so long.</p></body></html>

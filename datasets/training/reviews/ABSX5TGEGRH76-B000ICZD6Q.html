<meta name="summary" content="A Great Non-Mainstream Movie That Happens To Be Mainstream"></head><body><p>It is extremely rare when a movie made and produced by a major studio such as Universal can feel and entertain like an independent film.  Relatively, of course; while there are defininte Hollywood influences, compared to most of the crap that Hollywood puts out now, this film has a very non-mainstream feel to it.<br />"In Good Company" tells the story of three people living in New York City and its suburbs.  Dan Foreman (Dennis Quaid) is the head of ad sales at Sports America, one of the most prominent sports magazines in the country, and he has been happily employed there for about 30 years.  Everything suddenly changes when the publishing company that owns Sports America is bought out by the super-corporation Globecom, run by the eccentric Teddie K (an uncredited Malcolm McDowell), and soon, the 51-year-old Dan is demoted.  His replacement is the 26-year-old Carter Duryea (Topher Grace), an up-and-coming hot-shot who, while being a very nice guy, has no idea how to run an ad department.  The third member of the movie's trio is Alex Foreman (Scarlett Johansson), who has just transferred to NYU to pursue a degree in creative writing.<br />So at first, Dan obviously harbors a lot of animosity towards Carter.  Carter, however, looks up to Dan, despite the fact that he is Dan's boss, for not only does Dan know what he's doing, but Dan has "the perfect life" according to Carter (sadly for Carter, his wife of seven months, Kimberly [Selma Blair] has just left him- possibly for the second time).  Dan has a loving wife (Marg Helgenberger), two beautiful daughters (the other played by Zena Grey), and a third child on the way.  After Carter is able to get himself invited over for dinner, he and Alex begin a romantic relationship, and for the first time in his life, Carter may be truly happy.<br />The movie told a great story about corporations; while it never really called them evil, it did point out a lot of their shortcomings in comic ways.  I'm pretty sure that the CEO, Teddie K, is a caricature of the CEO of Virgin, and there is something he says that is probably one of the greatest jab at corporations in the movie, but it is very subtle (it may have even been an unintentional joke).  It dealt with selling sodas on all seven continents simultaneously (even Anctarctica!).  However, I was surprised that a movie seemingly about the dangers of corporations had so many corporate sponsorships (Dominoe's and Pepsi were even mentioned by name).<br />Lately, there have been way too many comedies that have had no heart.  In "In Good Company", you actually care about the characters, even when you are laughing with/at them, and believe me, there is a LOT to laugh about.  Furthermore, while all the actors in this movie do a great job, the three lead actors are astounding.  Grace and Quaid play extremely well each other, both when they are at odds as well as when they are friends.  The young Johansson keeps continuing to amaze me with both her talent and her beauty.  I can hardly believe that this girl is barely 20 years old (just about 2 years older than I am); both her acting ability and her appearance are a lot more mature than the average actress her age, which tends to be the over-surplussed "teen queen" (note to Ms. Johansson if you are reading this [not likely, though]: this is a compliment, and I'm sure you appreciate the benefits of not being part of that category).<br />As I said at the beginning of the review, this film had a very independent feel to it.  Unlike most mainstream movies, I was unable to predict the direction in which this film went, and I was very satisfied by the ending, which was definitely not a typical "Hollywood ending".  That's not to say that there weren't a few moments that felt a little contrived, but the majority of the film more than made up for the few instances of corn.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="IT COULD HAVE BEEN A CONTENDER..."></head><body><p>I am a sucker for sci-fi movies and, having loved the 1951 Robert Wise classic of the same name, starring Michael Rennie in the role of Klaatu, I was ready to see what Keanu Reeves would do in that same role of intergalactic messenger. The answer is: apparently nothing. It was just Keanu being Keanu.<br /><br />Robert Wise did more in 1951 with what he had to work with than Scott Derrickson had in 2008, which goes to show you that special effects alone do not make a film.  Although it gets off to a promising start and the special effects are excellent, after the first half hour of the film it is strictly downhill.<br /><br />The storyline is simple. Klaatu, an extraterrestrial, comes to Earth with his assistant on a mission. It appears that Earthlings have been observed by a superior species and found wanting. In the original 1951 film, the mission was clear. Klaatu lets the earthlings know that they need to clean up their act or they will be destroyed.  In the 2008 remake, Klaatu's message is that he has actually come to destroy Earthlings, because we have been found wanting.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly, in the role of Dr. Helen Bensen, a supposed top-notch scientist, gets all weepy with Klaatu, begging for another chance. Moreover, the constant interjection of the cute kid, played by Will Smith and Jada Pinkett's son, is really annoying and adds very little to this muddle of a film. It probably would have been a better film, if the whole subplot involving this child were removed, as it only weakened the film with all its sentimental claptrap.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Klaatu is left to ponder that age old question: just what is an Alien to do when confronted by a beautiful Earthling whose beautiful eyes well up with tears every time the Alien mentions killing off all of humanity? By now, everyone watching this film knows the answer, but Klaatu's last minute epiphany just does not ring true.<br /><br />This film is an example of science fiction overlaid with a lot of sentimental hogwash. It ends up being much ado about nothing. Still, sci-fi fans, such as myself, will probably want to see for themselves what all the fuss is about.  So, rent it before thinking of buying it.</p></body></html>

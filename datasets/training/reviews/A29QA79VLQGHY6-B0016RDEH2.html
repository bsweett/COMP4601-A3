<meta name="summary" content="Dark and delightful on DVD"></head><body><p>"This movie almost destroyed me, almost killed me," the director Guillermo del Toro says in a video introduction to his dark fairy tale "Pan's Labyrinth" (El Laberinto del fauno). "I hope you enjoy it and get lost in it." Viewers have little choice -- the brutality of the Spanish Civil War jackbooters and the Jungian terrors of olde fairy tale monsters conspire to give "Labyrinth" a fierce primal pull.<br /><br />New Line's DVD looks and sounds outstanding, as you'd expect. Audio options include ES and EX (New Line is one of the few remaining DVD makers to pony up for these high-end audio formats.) Del Toro does his usual thoughtful and detailed work in the commentary. The director also anchors a featurette in which he expounds on his theories about monsters, the power in the number 3 and how Hollywood ruined every fairy tale it touched.<br /><br />Another solid extra features Doug Jones -- the skinny actor costumed up to become the Faun and the Pale Man -- as he goes about his rubbery routines. Then there's an interactive look inside del Toro's sketch books for the project, dating back a decade -- fascinating to see how much of this came straight from the Mexican director's imagination.<br /><br />Another classy DVD from New Line, which nonetheless needs to get the lead out and bring the high-definition versions to market.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Never a dull moment in "The Da Vinci Code""></head><body><p>The 2003 novel "The Da Vinci Code" was one of the best novels I've read in years. It was one of the most adventurous novels that opened up an immense fascination with the topic of Christianity as a faith but especially with the history, both good and bad, of the establishment of the Roman Catholic Church. thus was very much anticipating the big screen adaption of the novel "The Da Vinci Code". To my utter, surprise, I think that it actually does an excellent job of doing the book justice to a high degree, even though the book version like all novels is far superior to any possible screen remakes possible. This movie is absolutely a phenomenal movie that I highly recommend seeing at the movie theatre!<br /><br /> The movie begins with an elderly man at the Louvre who is brutally murdered by an albino assassin named Silas. At the same time a lecture by a professor named Robert Langdon who is about to give a speech before a audience when a murder of an elderly man at the Louvre museum in Paris France, grabs the attention of Langdon. As Langdon researches the clues of the paintings and Leonardo Da Vinci's paintings, he discovers that the murder victim left a series of messages that contained secrets about the legend of Jesus Christ, his wife Mary Magdalene, and the possibility of there being descendants who are still alive in the present who carry on the truth about Christ's life. Joined by a French cryptologist named Sophie Neveu, Langdon discovers that the elderly man who was murdered was in fact a member of a secret society called the Priority of Sion.<br /><br />The two also discover a golden truth about a Holy Grail that has been `hidden' for over two thousand years that if revealed to the general public, threatens to shake the very foundations of Christianity as a religion.  However, the two find themselves trying to stay ahead of agents of Opus Dei, a hard-line fundamentalist Catholic organization, that vows to prevent the truth of the church from coming out as well as prevent the "Holy Grail" from being found. Unless Langdon and Neveu can decipher the numerous complex puzzles and figure out the ancient artifacts, the "Holy Grail" will end up being lost forever. It is believed according to the movies timeline that the Catholic Church is based on dubious, if not outright false pretenses on the truth of Jesus Christ and the Vatican is using the false basis as a means to stay in power by deliberately covering up the truth about the life of Christ as well as the story of his supposed wife Mary Magdalene and their descendants.<br /><br /> This movie in my opinion, actually does a great job of making an awesome novel into an actual movie. Granted, the book is far superior to the movie but for a movie adaptation, "The Da Vinci Code" ranks as one of the best screen adaptations I've seen in recent years. There is rarely, if ever, a dull moment throughout the entire movie. The whole topic of religion and faith, even though I'm technically a Presbyterian (I was baptized a Presbyterian when I was two), is fascinating. The movie has renewed my interest in learning more about the `official' as well as the true history of Christianity as well as it's numerous denominations and branches, both Catholic and Protestant as well as other branches of the religion.<br /><br /> I was totally surprised to actually see that Sir Ian McKellan actually stars in this movie as the eccentric researcher Leigh Teabigh as he helps the two find the artifacts and solve the puzzles before the clandestine Opus Dei and it's agents find it and hide it forever from the outside world. Tom Hanks was the perfect choice for the role of Robert Langdon. Even as I read the novel itself, I for some reason actually envisioned Tom Hanks playing him in the movie and to my pleasant surprise, was proven right all along. Though I don't want to change the subject too much in this review, Hanks is the most flexible actor I know of, as he plays the best average-joes in movies. He can play almost all kinds of characters, both good and evil. Paul Bettamy is scary as the albino assassin Silas with the scary looking eyes and facial expressions throughout the movie. Even more surprising was Alfred Molina who played Doctor Octavius in Spiderman 2 two years before then. Molina is great as the priest of the Prion of Sion who is loyal to the Teacher of the organization.<br /><br /> The book and movie have come under enormous criticism from the Catholic Church as well as other Christian sects for what is believed to be fabrications and distortions of the truth. The "Da Vinci Code" is a fictional book and thus I can't say I believe that all of the things are necessarily true. However, I do believe that there is a large amount of truths that are out there about the life of Jesus Christ that have yet to see the light of day. Anyhow, back to the movie, "The Da Vinci Code" is among the best novel adaptations that I've seen in years. I strongly recommend seeing this movie today!</p></body></html>

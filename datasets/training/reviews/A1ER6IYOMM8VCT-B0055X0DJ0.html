I actually liked the first film more this time around, even though I still think it is way too long for the material at hand. The second film 'Transformers - Revenge Of The Fallen' takes everything good about the first film and just throws in away! The film is longer with bigger FX, but the FX are so fast that it's really hard to appreciate them. The film is also plagued with ridiculous humor that is so corny I rolled my eyes so much I thought they might fall out of their sockets! The parents in particular are just awful and serve no purpose at all, except to add some humor (if you can call it that?), but end up being distracting and silly. Megan Fox's roll has been reduced to shameful sexy eye candy(for a kiddie film)and Shia has reached an all time low here.<br /><br />If you like films with no character development and tedious storylines, then this might be for you. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen and I hope it is the end to the series.Extremely disappointing film that isn't any fun at all.</p></body></html>

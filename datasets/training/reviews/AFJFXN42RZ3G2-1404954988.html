Cultures clash between two different worlds, but not without the effort to bring an understanding of where each have come and where they want to be.  In this case, hollywood meets the third world.  This is a story of  single Latin American woman who ventures to the United States with her daughter to seek the opportunity to live a better life.  The daughter narrates the story as part of an essay she writes for college entry to a prestigious university.  She owes her determination and influence to her mother.  Life finally begins in the US when her mother happens to find a job working as a housekeeper with an upscale American family where she and her daughter quickly become part of the family.  In the process, she almost loses her daughter to the family.<br /><br />SPANGLISH contains an array of serious issues from alcoholism to infidelity over a laugh track of irony that each character encounter.  Adam Sandler, the chef-father, appears to take the serious guy persona as opposed to his previous comedic roles. Cloris Leachman basically steals the show as the mother-in-law who adds a little tongue and cheek one liners through out the film.  However, her daughter as played by Tea Leoni appears to be the downer of the film with her overbearing presence.<br /><br />One question comes to mind, why did Brooks choose upscale California for this semi-comedic film about a Latin American woman and her daughter making it in the United States?  Yes, stereotypes prevail, but not without the attempt to bridge the communication gap.  However, in the end each family return to their respective worlds where they can live comfortably, and possibly learn from each other's experience.</p></body></html>

In the film version of the story, an unmanned train wreaks havoc as it gains speed and becomes uncontrollable.  A veteran railroad engineer, recently given his `notice', decides to play hero while out training a rookie train conductor.  The pair, oddly mixed yet more similar than expected, take on the treacherous task of manually stopping the train.  Thanks to the chemistry between Chris Pine and Denzel Washington, `Unstoppable' maintains our attention, and deservedly so.  The plot at times seems farfetched, and the action can seem over the top and yet it all works thanks to some spitfire editing and sharp direction from Tony Scott, the lesser (yet the vastly underrated) of the two Scott brothers.  With nicely shot cinematography, expertly used visual effects and an effective score, `Unstoppable' is a lot more fun and thrilling and memorable than one may expect.  The rather unexpected heaps of praise the film received were certainly justified.  It's an obvious fabrication of actual events in order to heighten the `thrill factor', and yet it reads honest thanks to the dedication from everyone involved.  This is one of those summer flicks you won't feel guilty about watching over and over again.</p></body></html>

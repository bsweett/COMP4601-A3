Almost all of the actors have returned (Pyro and Shadowcat being the exceptions) and they all gave wonderful performances, but once again, the special effects were the shining stars of the film.  This time, the story is about a mutant hater who has devised a plan to eliminate every mutant on Earth, but he needs Prof. X to do it, so he kidnaps him.  The X-Men are forced to temporarily side with Magneto and Mystique in order to save Xavier and themseleves from annihilation.  A nice addition to the team is the teleporting Nightcrawler, and Rouge, Iceman, and Pyro get bigger roles.  The script corrected most of the problems that the first movies had, so there were no flubbed lines, such as the lightning/Toad thing in X-Men.  Finally, the fight between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike was amazing!  If you liked the first movie, you will love this one.  If you didn't like the first one, you may still like this one.  I mean, the first one was great, but this one was so much better.  You will love it!</p></body></html>

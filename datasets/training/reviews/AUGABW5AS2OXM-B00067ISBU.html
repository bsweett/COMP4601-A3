<meta name="summary" content="Movie Of The Year!"></head><body><p>This is one of the more original movies that I have seen in<br />quite some time.Hellboy was originally a comic book hero.He is<br />called in from the dark side by Rasputin and the Nazis.He is a<br />baby devil,red,with horns and a tail,and an armored right arm.<br />Instead of becoming a tool of evil he is raised by the professor<br />who raises him to be a good guy.He fights monsters while smoking cigars,drinking Bud light,and showing a very good sense of humor.<br />He has a fish man and a pyrotechnic woman as partners.Rasputin<br />returns to the scene with some very evil monsters.Hellboy and<br />Rasputin have a final showdon in Russia.This is an outstanding movie that has some unique villians and heros.The scenery and special effects are outstanding as well.See this movie,you will enjoy it.</p></body></html>

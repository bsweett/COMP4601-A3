My wife and daughter have watched it numerous times on VHS, but I either wasn't home at the time or I was interested in something else.  My wife considers this film to be her favorite Disney movie.  Having watched it for the first time tonight, I understand why.<br /><br />The Disney version of this fairy tale is inspired by Tchaikovsky's ballet.  With the wonderful "Once Upon A Dream" waltz, a cast of likeable characters including the fairies Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather and a classic Disney villain in Maleficent, "Sleeping Beauty" is two parts love story and one part action yarn.  Humor is provided by the fathers of Aurora and Prince Philip, as well as the fairies.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the story, Maleficent casts a spell on the infant Aurora.  On her sixteenth birthday, she is to fall into a deadly sleep.  Luckily the kind fairy Merryweather had not yet given Aurora a gift.  In order to save her life, Merryweather casts a protective spell that prevents Aurora from passing away but puts her into a deep sleep.  This slumber can only be broken by her true love's kiss.  From there, the story has magic, a dragon, and an ending that's both beautiful and funny.<br /><br />The 50th Anniversary Platinum Edition of Walt Disney's classic is a masterpiece.  The film looks beautiful.  It is set in a widescreen format and has been digitally restored to a colorful and eye-popping presentation.  The sound is also excellent and the music is simply wonderful.<br /><br />The DVD is loaded with special features.  It includes an alternate opening sequence, a game in which you can learn a waltz, a look into the life of Tchaikovsky, the musical "Grand Canyon Suite" and much, much more.  Heck, even the standard Disney Channel television star music video is good.  This time around it's Emily Osment's popped-up version of "Once Upon A Dream."<br /><br />I can honestly say that "Sleeping Beauty" has worked her way into my top ten list of Disney films.  It's a wonderful film for the whole family and deserves a spot on everybody's DVD (or Blu-ray) shelf.</p></body></html>

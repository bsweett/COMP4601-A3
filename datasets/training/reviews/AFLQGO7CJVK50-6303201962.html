<meta name="summary" content="Star Trek II"></head><body><p>Star Trek is too boring compared to Star Wars, some say. This changes that. This movie is about two ships and two captains battling for their lives in a duel to the death. Nemesis is the same concept. This focuses more on battle than drama. If you like a more action-packed form of sci-fi, this is for you. All-star cast including Ricardo Montalban(Fantasy Island.etc.) and the usual Star Trek original cast. Easily a better Star Trek choice along with Nemesis.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Kidman is fantastic is excellent in well done ghost story"></head><body><p>"The Others" is a superb ghost story with the best twist ending since "The Sixth Sense". It has no dazzling special effects. Instead, it relies on atmosphere [darkness and shadows, fog, sounds, a malevolent old house], a literate script and great acting. Because it is somewhat old-fashioned and because its pace isn't lightening fast, it's at least as appealing to adults as it is to teens. <p>Grace Stewart lives in a vast, isolated mansion on an island off the coast of England with her two young children, Anne and Nicholas. Her husband has yet to come home from the recently ended W.W.II. The children have a disease that makes them allergic to bright light. All the curtains must be drawn in any room they are in. Doors must be kept closed. The servants have recently vanished in the night, leaving the high-strung, fanatically religious Grace alone to care for the kids. It is a lonely and claustrophobic existence. Help arrives in the form of three servants who once worked in the house years before the Stewarts moved in. Before long, Anne claims that she's seeing strange people in the house. Grace refuses to believe her until even odder events occur. And the three servants, who at first seemed so kind and caring, become somehow threatening. What on earth is going on? Or is it of this earth? <p>Nicole Kidman is mesmerizing as Grace Stewart. She is in nearly every scene. Her character is a difficult one that vacillates between loving mother and screaming banshee. At the hands of a less accomplished actress, the role might have produced some unintentional laughter, but Ms. Kidman makes us feel empathy and compassion for sad, unhappy Grace. Also of note are Alakina Mann as Anne and Fionula Flanigan as Bertha Mills, one of the mysterious servants. Like Bette Davis and Meryl Streep, Kidman is an extremely versatile and powerful actress, but Mann and Flanigan manage to hold their own with her admirably.<p>"The Others" was written and directed by Alejandro Amenabar, a young Spaniard whose 1997 film, "Abre les ojos" was recently remade by Cameron Crowe as "Vanilla Sky". He also wrote the music. His accomplished, sophisticated score adds a great deal to the film. He's a remarkable talent.</p></body></html>

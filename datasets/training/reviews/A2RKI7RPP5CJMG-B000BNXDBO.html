Some of the scenes in this flick are hilarious, but most of the movie just seems to plod along between those scenes.<br /><br />It starts out easy enough, Harold("American Pie's" John Cho) is your average Asian intelligent guy stuck in a deadend job.  He gets walked on by his co-workers and is stuck doing their work for the evening.  His roommate, the underachieving screw-up, Kumar(the Indian kid in "Van Wilder"), just wants to live life on the Mary Jane plane.  The two roomies end up sharing some weed and then deciding to venture out to White Castle to grab some grub.  What happens after that is a ton of racially stereotyped jokes, literal bathroom humor, weed humor, and Doogie Howser, M.D.<br /><br />Like I said before, this flick has its moments.  Neil Patrick Harris nearly steals the show by playing himself.  A run in with a cheetah is also very funny.  However, this film continuously stalled between the fun parts.<br /><br />What you have in the end is an "Odd Couple"-like buddy flick where the main characters are a bit likeable, but not quite funny enough.  I'd rent this one before I'd buy it, but chances are that if you do watch this flick with a little weed in your system, you'll think that this is the greatest film ever made.</p></body></html>

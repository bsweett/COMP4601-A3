His name is synonymous with suspense and horror. But his excellence as a suspenseful story teller does not end with the gripping edge of your seat story that we all love to be frightned by. It goes beyond that, as he delves into the lives of the characters that we find ourselves getting caught up with and maybe even identifying with. "Rear Window" is probably the definitive film of Hitchcock's brillant career that combines these elements, along with the humor,sensuality and the camera work he is famous for.<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart plays the lead character in this frightning tale. He is L.B. Jeffries, a photojournalist who is now wheelchair bound,due to a broken leg. It is not just the cast on his leg that is driving him crazy, he is itching for some adventure and cooped up in his tiny apartment seems to be getting cabin fever. Inquistive by nature, this regular joe or "Jeff" as he's called, innocently starts looking across the courtyard of the apartment complex just to see what the neighbors are up to.And the beauty of this film is that we become involved with these people right along with him.<br /><br />We become intrigued by the many different personalities he is privy to. There's the ballerina, the songwriter, the newlyweds(darn they pulled the shades down!), the lonley spinster and the pitiful salesman (Raymond Burr) who seems to be saddled with a nagging wife. Hitch weaves his magic and even as Jeff falls asleep, we are still privy to something possibly sinister going on in this last apartment, and you just want to say "Wake up Jimmy, look what Raymond Burr is doing now!"<br /><br />Jeff becomes more and more involved with the lives he is intruding on, and eventually realizes there are some strange and sinister events happening and has reason to believe there has been a murder. But how can he prove this? Who would believe him? There is not enough evidence to prove it, as a matter of fact most of the evidence proves the victim is merely away on a trip.The suspense is riveting and frightning as the "suspect" realizes he is being watched, and poor Jimmy all alone in the wheelchair, defenseless, with only his camera to protect him!<br /><br />There is yet a second story line going on in this little apartment. One of romance(of course). Grace Kelly, plays Lisa, a beautiful socialite enamored of Jeff and is doing her best to direct Jeff's attention away from the window and towards her. Jeff of course finds her devastingly beautiful but is not ready to committ to a stationary life. Lisa, in some very tense moments and in her quest to prove to him that she can live any life he has in mind, risks her own life and limb to help him prove his murder theory.<br /><br />Looking for Hitch....Close to the :30 minute mark you will find him making good use of his "Time" on screen.<br /><br />Stewart is so captivating in his performance, his facial expressions alone tell the story of what he is witnessing. Grace Kelly was honored with Best Actress awards from both the Nat'l Board of Review and the N.Y. Film Critics(also for her work that year in "The Country Girl" and "Dial M for Murder"). She is simply marvelous in this role. Raymond Burr, a man of few words in this one, is terrific at scaring us to death. And I must also mention the best character actress ever to grace the screen,(nominated 6 times for Best Supporting actress by Oscar), Miss Thelma Ritter. She is outstanding as Jeff's nurse who's words seem to take on new meaning when she says them.<br /><br />The film,made in 1954, is beautifully restored and looks great on this transfer to DVD. "The Kiss" scene must be seen to be appreciated. The color seems just a little dated, but hardly noticable. The pictures is clear, in Anamorphic Widescreen at 1.66:1(the intended ratio). The Sound is very good in Dolby Stereo. Lots of Special Features(see tech info for complete list) including a featurette where you will find filmaker Peter Bogdonavich, talking about the film and even has some audio interviews with "the master" himself giving his viewpoints of certain scenes. The captions for hearing impaired are good, indicating when there is music and who is singing(i.e. Bing Crosby). But the captions are not in the black bar portion, but at the bottom of the picture. All together a great package for a great classic.<br /><br />Some great reading for Hitch fans to be found in:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0380799456">Hitchcock's Notebooks: An Authorized And Illustrated Look Inside The Creative Mind Of Alfred Hitchcock</a><br /><br />Watch it with your neighbor(or maybe not...)......enjoy...Laurie</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Well, it got my attention..."></head><body><p>...that's for sure! If not the best nor my favorite horror-movie I find it amongst the better ones (it is original as a big plus) -this being said; hm, let's be honest here, most horror-movies (I repeat; Most!) contain some lack of intelligence and fantasy to make the "utilmate complete story", and scores instead on style and special-effects, it seldom depends too much on the acting, what matters are the fit locations and the sound-effects play a big part too.<br /><br />There are exeptions of course; We have masterpieces like the classic "The Excorsist" and "The Omen" (and many more), and also the more recent "The Sixth Sence" and "The Others". Fantastic!<br /><br />"The Ring" and "The Grudge" are perhaps even creepier than them all, but let's face it; Not much story behind the effective camera-work and sound-effects that make the viewers sit tightened to their seats biting their fingernails off. Some stories have more to tell than others.<br /><br />The best part of "Jeepers Creepers" is the car, that alone looks scary ("Who drives something looking as mean as that!"). Bravo!<br /><br />I thought the first half like many others is the best part, but the second part is anything but boring. Predictable perhaps, not livivng up to its' premise, but indeed entertaining.<br /><br />I have no problem recommending this movie, very good!</p></body></html>

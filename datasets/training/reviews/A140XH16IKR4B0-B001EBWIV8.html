<meta name="summary" content="Pompous and boring"></head><body><p>What a shame that this second release in the Matrix trilogy couldn't continue to deliver on the manic and original fun of the first. To be honest, I only watched the first hour, I was so bored by the weird semi-religious nonsense and the tiresome delivery of pompous dialog and the repetitious stunts that I never developed enough interest to see the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Only for the true devotee.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="As good as it could have been"></head><body><p>The film changes plenty of Bret Easton Ellis's wonderful novel, but thankfully it retains the all-important ambiguity: does Patrick Bateman really engage in acts of unspeakable brutality, or are these merely the fantasies of a mind increasingly unhinged by the excesses of high-rent American hedonism?  A brave Christian Bale is unforgettable as the tragi-comic Bateman, and will have you thanking the fatally cautious Leonardo DiCaprio for passing on the role.  Writer/director Mary Harron perfectly captures the ambience of the novel, and the design by Gideon Ponte and Andrew M. Stearn goes a long way to making low-budget look high class.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Close, But No Cigar..."></head><body><p>A decent cocktail of "Quantum Leap", "Groundhog Day" and "Twelve Monkeys" which sees Jake Gyllenhaal's s air-force pilot seconded into a covert military operation and forced to relive the final eight minutes of a commuter train bombing - via the expedient of a quantum simulation - in order to try and ascertain the identity of the bomber and avert a further terrorist catastrophe.<br /><br />It's a decent enough film although not quite the tour-de-force I was hoping for from "Moon" director Duncan Jones's second feature. Gyllenhaal makes a nicely tweaked lead in the Bruce-Willis-in-12 Monkeys tradition but the rest of the cast - with the exception of Vera Farmiga and a criminally underused Jeffrey Wright - are fairly forgettable.<br /><br />Definitely a case of "Close but no Cigar"; unfortunately not quite the classic it could have been with a little more polish.</p></body></html>

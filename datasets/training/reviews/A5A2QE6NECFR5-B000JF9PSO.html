This film lets us sit in a seat in the plane, and in the chairs of air traffic controllers and others who had to try to figure out what the hell was happening that morning. No well-known actors are there to destroy the realism. No on-screen narration distracts from the confusion felt by the characters, all real folks. It's a movie one only needs to see once. When you see it, you get mad and sad all over again. Then you come back to 2007 and realize the guy who made it happen is still alive in Pakistan or Afghanistan or who knows where, more than five years later, probably laughing at our mess in Iraq and at the fact that even in Khandahar and Kabul we haven't fully defeated him. Could anyone have believed, on 9/12/01, that by 2007 Osama Bin Laden and his doctor friend/fiend/spokesman would still be alive and free, while these passengers and that crew are long dead and in danger of being forgotten?</p></body></html>

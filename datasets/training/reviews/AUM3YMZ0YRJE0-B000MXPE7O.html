<meta name="summary" content="bureaucratic thriller"></head><body><p>This is one of those films about which people feel very strongly, positive or negative:  it does not fit into an easy category (e.g. Bond-like action), has extraordinary nuance that speaks to very specific interests (bureaucratic power, the private life of spies, civilian control over dirty tricks, elite secret societies), and has wonderfully understated acting that hides what is going on underneath more than acts it out.  If it isn't for everyone, I found it utterly fascinating and engaging all the way through.<br /><br />The plot revolves around a group initiated into Yale's Skull & Bones club, the elite of the elite who gain connections that will benefit them for the rest of their lives after they are "chosen" and submit to bizarre rituals.  In the mid-1930s, they were white, from privileged WASP families from the NE, and naively patriotic (e.g. George HW Bush).  While fitting in, Damon's character has subtle problems:  son of a suicide who was apparently corrupt and perhaps even a traitor, deeply troubled in his relationships, and deeply secretive to protect his innermost feelings.  Taken into the OSS and married after an almost accidental sexual encounter, he grows into a master spy at the moment that his Skull & Bones "brothers" are founding the CIA.  He becomes one of their early top officials.<br /><br />The viewer enters into the spy's world view, not as dashing swashbucklers, but as the ultimate manipulators of events and opinions from bureaucratic perches in depressingly plain offices.  Their mission is to protect American security, but their activities define their purview in a far wider way than merely military.  Even the architect behind it (de Niro) has misgivings, which the younger "brothers" apparently do not.  In many ways, they begin to be corrupted by their power, which they love yet are not overt about it.  It is a wonderful study of how a professional bureaucracy evolves into ever new areas.  The violence, which underpins everything they are managing, makes only a few brief appearances, which are frighteningly realistic, subdued yet sudden.  Trusting no one, through Damon you see how it impacts their private lives.<br /><br />The Damon character, who had great potential to grow in a very different direction, becomes completely consumed by his duty and subtle lust for power as he masses evidence on his own colleagues as well.  His wife, a great beauty from a Skull & Bones family (Jolie in an unusually subtle role that matches her talents), suffers terribly from his mission-driven egotism, as does his son; they live with constant fear and dread.  In a way, he self-destructs, but at the same time he is an extraordinary achiever and, in my view, a completely believable psychological profile:  he was working to please an absent parent, was driven by his sense of class and purpose, and had extreme talent.  But all of this is revealed in ways that must be interpreted, a layer below his gloomy, dutiful surface, which is great fun if you like to let characters like this enter your imagination.<br /><br />The plot is also wonderfully complex, if somewhat confusing with all the skips in time.  It is based around the failure of the Bay of Pigs fiasco.  A seeming friend, his Soviet counterpart is seeking ways to undermine and co-opt him:  his efforts are yet another way that complicates the Damon character's life, with terrible consequences that once again are not completely spelled out.  Did he follow the route of his father?  Somewhat less?  Can you become partially corrupt?  Or did he betray the last things he held dear for the sake of his career and integrity?  There are no clear answers to these questions, but if the film has spoken to you, you formulate your own answers.  This is filmmaking, in my view, at its absolute best.<br /><br />Recommended as a masterpiece.  All the details are as delicious as they are deliberate.  The acting is first rate, understated, and rich in ambiguity.</p></body></html>

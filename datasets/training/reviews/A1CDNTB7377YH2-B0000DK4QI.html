<meta name="summary" content="A Modern Most Dangerous Game"></head><body><p>Arnold in an updated version of Most Dangerous Game against an alien hunter who can be invisible, has a force field, has heat sensors, and super advanced weaponry.  This is one of the most memorable aliens in the history of cinema.<p>Arnold's group of elite soldiers (they appear to be Rangers) are sent on a rescue mission in a South American jungle.  It turns out there are more than just bad guys there.  There is also, the above mentioned alien who loves to hunt them down one by one and take something from the victim as a trophy.<p>There are some memorable lines, especially what Arnold says to the alien after he sees what he looks like under his body armor.  <p>Arnold does seem to take more punishment than appears to be humanly possible and survive.  If you can get by that, you will highly enjoy this film.  Definately worth owning!</p></body></html>

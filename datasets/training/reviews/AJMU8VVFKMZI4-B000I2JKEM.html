<meta name="summary" content="An absolute delight"></head><body><p>I had no desire to see this movie when it was released in the theater. despite my love of all thing Depp.  So I have no idea what possessed me to watch it now.  But I'm so glad I did.  What a delightful story of Victor Van Dort and his many brides.  Both living and dead.  I love the ideas presented.  The dead more alive than the living and vice versa.  Wonderful puppets and good musical score to match.  If you haven't seen this movie, you are doing yourself a great disservice.  Watch this movie and then tells your friends.  Love it.</p></body></html>

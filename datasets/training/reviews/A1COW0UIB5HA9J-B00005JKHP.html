<meta name="summary" content="Very good start of a great Sci-fi film franchise!"></head><body><p>Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) with his crew (Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelly, George Takei, James Doohan, Majel Barret, Walter Koenig and Nichelle Nichols) joined by two new members like Decker (Stephen Collins), Bald female alien Illea (Persis Khambatta) as they take a new mission on their newly reinvented U.S.S. Enterprise. Their mission is to find a mysterious alien spaceship that has wiped out a few Klingon ships before it heads towards Earth and destroys it.<br /><br />A very good if slow start of the popular Star Trek film installment which is based on the timeless TV show of the same name. The original cast is reunited after 10 years in this film event of 1979 that made audiences believe that Star Trek can live again but in a motion picture, director Robert Wise and producer Gene Roddenberry does a nice job of bringing the show on the screen. Jerry Goldsmith's score is phenomenal as it later became the main theme for "Star Trek The Generation" and the special effects were good for it's time especially the production design, yes it doesn't have much action like it's sequels but rather more on atmosphere.  But this brand new cut really improves on the film itself with remastered sound and never before seen footage plus newly remastered special effects, it still is a good beginning for the franchise as it's sequel is even better.<br /><br />This 2-Disc DVD set contains excellent picture and sound with nifty extras like three retrospective documentaries, interviews, Teasers and Trailers, TV Spots, 5 additional scenes from the 1979 theatrical cut, 11 Deleted scenes from the 1983 TV version, Storyboards, and a promo for "Star Trek: Enterprise".</p></body></html>

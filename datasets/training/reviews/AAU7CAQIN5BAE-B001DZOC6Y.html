<meta name="summary" content=""The Unbridled Ignorance of M.Night haters""></head><body><p>Review: 'The Happening'<br />Roving Info: Director: M. Night Shyamalan<br />The Buzz: James Newton Howard, (in which the score is often errie and filled with actual purpose, fitting the breathtaking cinematography)<br /><br />A. Let me start by providing you with actual post on Various sites about M. Night's work and The Happening, food for thought to start the review:<br /><br />---He should make a movie in which he dies, NOW THAT WOULD BE awsome, (sic) I would see it just not to feel bad about throwing my money away with The lady in the water and The happening. What do you think. ---<br /><br />---Hi Arjun from India here and this guy is just embarrassing to all Indians. He should stop making movies. ---<br /><br />---He seriously needs to do Bollywood. He can use his "originality" there - maybe have the actors dance around in dinosaur suits or something.  --- (or something, riveting!)<br /><br />---His last 3 movies have been terribble. His storylines are always full of holes and pretty pointless. He should give everyone that went to go see "The Happening" the price of there ticket back out of his own pocket. Hopefully the next time he's in a bid to do another movie, some one else is smart enough to remeber(sic) the absolute bombs hes been making, and politely show him to the door---<br /><br />---I wouldn't rent a Shyamalan DVD even if it came with a free prostitute!---<br /><br />---Seriously, this guy's career should have been over the day after Unbreakable came out. Not one movie of his since the Sixth Sense has been of any decent quality...NOT ONE! Do us all a favor, Night...blacklist yourself! Told!---(huh?)<br /><br />---I don't hate the guy personally, but when he showed up with "The Sixth Sense" and then "Unbreakable" i think i and a lot of others, thought he was a guy who could provide moviegoers with years of great movies.<br />His output has been close to awful, and declining steadily ever since.<br />So i don't hate him. I'm just really disappointed---<br /><br />One can no clearly see the kind of blatant and common ignorance and stupidity amongst the masses, the claim they hate someone because of a certain type of film genre that person doesn't agree with. Morever, the most common element in most M. Night haters, is they dont just hate one of his films, they despise ALL OF THEM, and then throw in their nuances here and there as to why it was 'ok most of the time, but the rest I just didn't get.' Get a wetnap.<br /><br />Our last friend said he was really disappoinmted, disappointed in what??????????? originality? nonlinear? err, different? Off the beaten path of movie fans who adore live-action, comicbook saturation, and the same people that make Bev Hills Chihuahua the number one grossing movie in the box office of late, and that, that my friends, is the very coinage of our times. What a sad lot.<br /><br />1. I truly believe that most of the people that despise M. Night, and I am indeed generalizing, couldn't grasp the conceptual understanding that his movies ARE supposed to be that way. The movies are supposed to actually dare you to be different and even on the mass ignorance that abounds on message boards like 'IMDB' and 'Fandango', make you try to think out of the box. His films, especially 'Sixth Sense' and unequivocally 'The Village', take the film goer out of the realm of being and even for two hours, transport you to M's world. What's wrong with that? What's wrong with being different AND brillaint? You go make a film and see how ORIGINAL it is. I firmly believe that the lovers of M's movies, are a rare breed, a special kind of movie lover. They attain 'Ken' status of the kind of people I want to surround myself with. Not Ironman fanatics. The folks who I have met who are passionate about movies, think that 'The Village' is one of the greatest films of the last ten years, and I have to agree.<br />It's hard for people to accept different I suppose. These same Night haters, are going to bash him, prod him and hate his movies, long before they are released, all because they are not part of that circle, they have very limited attention spans, and couldn't for the life of them try to conceptually follow a film like the 'Sixth Sense' or 'The Village'. I would suppose it could be the equivalent of taking someone from a rolling-open admissions community college and dropping them in a full semesters load at Yale.<br /><br />2. This unbridled ignorance is truly astounding. Like the samples of post on IMDB and the like, the totality of claims of why the haters, completely loath his films and career is clearly evident. "His movies suck, he sucks, they are boring and pointless and they dont make sense" Hmm, nice argument. In my time off of recent, I have sifted through 100's of post, and for the most part, the reasoning or lack there of, is purely the same. Personally, I am not a fan of sketch comedy type films, anything with Will Ferell or the like, and not a Cohen Brothers fan, I don't enjoy chick flicks, or anything with Martin Lawrence. I believe Lucas should have left the Star Wars Series where it was at in the seventies and eighties and not made the abomination of the later three we were mauled into watching. I think Taratino is as untalented of a director as The Rock is to his acting ability, however, and I mention all these personal opinions, to say I would take an M. Night film, albeit even bad, any day of the week, month or year, over what is in the box office today.<br /><br />The Film:::::::While I do agree with most folks assessment on the nature of The Happening being feverishly boring to the point of yawning many times, and lacking appropriate suspense, I found it rather intriguing. My major problem with the film was the wooden characters, and that would reflect poor writing and directing, however, that doesn't mean the person is bad at his profession period. It is strange to me the often non tangible characters in the film, especially Walhberg's role, considering M. Night's expertise at amazing dialouge and interactions. I didn't often heavily care whether they escaped the toxin, could care less about his wife, and don't really care about anyone else they picked up along the way. However, the plot is in an element all its own, and if you havent seen it, ignore these haters and naysayers and see for yourself, with an open and shrewd eye to something different. The film has M. Night's signature on it, as if I were screening it without any credits not knowing who's it was, I would without question, say Night did this film. Original, thought provoking and mildly entertaining. People here can dissect each element of the film, and dog it, bring it down in ratings, and use their splendid fingers to tell us just why it was so bad. The same way those, perhaps same people, use unwarranted claims as to why films like Death Proof are revolutionary.<br /><br />There are very few movies that I actually go to see in the physical theatres. Anytime an epic comes out like 'Troy', '300' or stuff like 'Dances With Wolves', because of the totality and grand majesty of such a film that only can be appreciated on the big screen. That said, the one director, save Speilberg for the most part, that I always will go see is M. Night, hate him or love him, he certainly causes an uproar in the online movie loving community. Why? Because he is different, and makes us think, and brings us films that few, IF ANY, director can in todays saturated market of blockbusters and cookie-cutter talent.<br /><br />In conclusion: While the film may not be for the everyday movie goer, it certainly has its market. No it wasn't the best film, in fact it wasn't the best Night film by a long shot, but it was still unique, interesting and different, and for that alone, I enjoyed it intensely. The haters can't like it, they aren't capable of liking it, they will never like ANYTHING he does, and they are increasingly annoying. If you don't like his movies, then DONT GO SEE THEM, if you think they are going to be awful, then don't waste your money, if you cant stand him being different and cutting edge with ideas that make our minds wonder and yearn for more, then don't SEE HIS MOVIES. There are a lot of us that do like M. Night, and nothing you can say will ever change that fact.</p></body></html>

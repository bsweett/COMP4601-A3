<meta name="summary" content="Nicolas Cagenegger Strikes Again!"></head><body><p>Second-rate Las Vegas lounge magician Chris Johnson (Cage) has a little precognitive secret: he can see events up to two minutes in the future. Some generic nonamerican (of course!) terrorists have kidnapped a nuclear device and will blow things up with it (hey, they're terrorists with a bomb, right? What else would they do?!) unless joyless FBI bigwig Agent Ferris (Moore) can force Chris to use his gift to stop les bad guys. Oh, and there's some pretty female called Liz (Biel) in there too, just for good measure.<br /><br />This is a terribly boring, poorly-made movie. There's no reason or setup for the bad guys, or their theft of the bomb, no explanation whatsoever behind Chris Johnson's prowess in physical combat and no chemistry at all from any one of the principal actors. The standards of dialogue and direction present in "Next" are so below par that, essentially, it feels like there's a good thirty minutes of plot missing - and a bad thirty minutes too many of Nicolas Cage dashing about being Nicolas Cage.<br /><br />Perhaps I missed part of this movie (even though I watched it all) or perhaps it's a sequel to something better, some other film with the missing pieces to this (boring, frustrating) puzzle? But when talented actors such as Moore, Biel and yes, even Cage, are paraded so lazily in front of the audience with little or no substance behind their characters and a very sketchy plot, not even Star Quality or these A-List names can compensate for the lack of a decent basic plot.<br /><br />Gimmicky and base, this film isn't anywhere near as entertaining as the so-so National Treasure series. Don't bother with this one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""We're Vikings. We have stubbornness issues.""></head><body><p>Vikings are by all accounts burly, hairy, looming, and fierce, and that's probably just the womenfolk. Hiccup, the movie's sometime narrator, isn't your average tough and brawly Viking. Hiccup happens to be a hapless, noodly-figured, often scorned Viking teenager, and that his father is the intimidating village chief is maybe the sole reason why he isn't kicked more to the curb. Hiccup spends most of his days trying to prove himself to the warrior community. He only keeps on embarrassing himself. He's often relegated to the smithy, indoors and safe as the blacksmith's lowly apprentice.<br /><br />Hiccup's village sits on a desolate island, and it's a bleak living, made even more arduous by frequent encroachments of ravaging, fire-breathing dragons. Hundreds of years have seen these battle-craving Vikings hunting down these dragons, and Hiccup is expected to step into this manly habit. Except that Hiccup, an outsider and more introspective than most, will sort of accidentally topsy turvy that age-old tradition. But that's only if he makes it thru dragon slaying school. And if he survives his efforts to befriend the elusive Night Fury dragon.<br /><br />DreamWorks Animation still lags behind Pixar, but HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON goes a ways in garnering street cred for DreamWorks. It's real easy to get behind the story, its themes and philosophies, and the likable central character. The best things - or, rather, my favorite bits - about this film all have to do with Hiccup hanging out with his dragon and incidentally picking up invaluable insights in dealing with dragons. Toothless the Night Fury dragon is awesome and wonderfully expressive. Whenever Toothless springs into action, the film pulses with an exhilarating sense of adventure. These moments are when we're reminded that Toothless may be adorable but he's still very much a formidable presence. The message of tolerance and open-mindedness is naturally integrated into the story, so thankfully this doesn't at all feel like one of those very special Blossom episodes.<br /><br />The animation is really excellent, with the CG artists opting for more playful, more exaggerated renditions of the human characters and the dragons. The most realistically rendered elements turn out to be the atmospheric land-, sea-, and skyscapes. The dragon flights in this film are as breathtaking as those we saw in AVATAR. It makes me wish I'd seen this in 3D. I don't know why these Vikings have burry Scottish accents, but it does give us a chance to listen to the always funny Craig Ferguson (Gobber), so it's all good. Gerard Butler, who plays Hiccup's bullish father, channels his roaring persona from 300.<br /><br />So I've got the 2-DVD set. Disc 1 has the feature presentation and the following bonus stuff:<br /><br />- Audio commentary with Filmmakers Chris Sanders, Dean DeBlois, and Bonnie Arnold<br /><br />- "Viking-Sized Cast" has interviews with the voice actors (00:11:44 minutes long)<br /><br />- "The Technical Artistry of HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON" - a focus on the film's state-of-the-art CG technology (00:10:13)<br /><br />- "Get Your Game On" previews the HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON and KUNG FU PANDA WORLD video games<br /><br />- Trailers to SHREK FOREVER AFTER, THE PENGUINS OF MADAGASCAR, THE LAST AIRBENDER, and the upcoming MEGAMIND<br /><br />- The trailer to and a Behind the Scenes segment on SHREK THE MUSICAL<br /><br />The second DVD offers the fun animated short, LEGEND OF THE BONEKNAPPER DRAGON. It runs at around 16 minutes long. Taking place some time after the events in the film, this one tells of how the blacksmith Gobber, Hiccup and his young Viking friends embark on a quest across the icy seas for the mythical Boneknapper dragon. But they end up stranded on a barren rock formation. This short also features moments of old school 2D animation (whenever Gobber is flashing back to one of his rather far-fetched stories). My biggest beef with this short: Toothless is barely in this one.<br /><br />Bonus material for this second DVD:<br /><br />- 3 Deleted Scenes from the feature film, done in rough storyboard sketches, with intros from Director/Co-Writer Dean DeBlois (total running time: 00:07:34 minutes)<br /><br />- "The Story Behind the Story" presents an interview with HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON author Cressida Cowell (00:07:40 minutes)<br /><br />- ""Racing for the Gold" is a fun, quick, animated peek into four categories within the Viking Winter Games (bobsledding, speed skating, ski jumping, and snowboarding) and also the medal ceremony for that greatest of Viking sports, Dragon Training (the top medal is made out of ham)<br /><br />- Animator Gabe Hordos instructs on "How to Draw Toothless" (00:10:57)<br /><br />- "Take the Viking Personality Test" - Take a multiple-choice survey to learn which of the characters in the film you're most like<br /><br />- "DreamWorks Animation Video Jukebox" allows you to click on songs from previous DreamWorks animated flicks: "I'm a Believer" (SHREK), "I Like To Move It, Move It" (MADAGASCAR), "Everybody Was Kung Fu Fighting" (KUNG FU PANDA), "Rockin' the Suburbs" (OVER THE HEDGE), and "Here Comes the Sun" (BEE MOVIE)<br /><br />- "Dragon Activity Center" - Insert this DVD into your PC and access the following DVD-ROM activities: "Build Your Own Dragons" (construct a life-size Toothless, a 3D Gronckle, a 3D Terrible Terror, and a 3D Night Fury) and "Viking Zone" (a peek at Viking Accessories, Viking & Dragon Masks, Flashlight Patterns, Growth Chart, Coloring Pages, and Stickers)</p></body></html>

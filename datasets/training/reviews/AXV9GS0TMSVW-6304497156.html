<meta name="summary" content="I don't care what anyone says - it still holds up"></head><body><p>I spoke to someone recently who said he couldn't watch zombie movies because of Night of the Living Dead - not because it was scary, but because he felt the effects were bad and not scary enough.  I guess in an age of horror movies delivered to theatres on an almost weekly basis, it's hard for younger audiences to appreciate the delicacy of the classic that started it all.<br /><br />Romero perfected the formula for horror by providing several key elements - a gang of strangers in an isolated area where they are trapped at night.  The isolation alone must have given moviegoers a scare back in 1968.  But it goes beyond that.  The crude effects and idea of the zombies, mindlessly attacking our unsuspecting heroes and the mere thought of the zombie child in the final act are terrifying.<br /><br />But this was more than a mindless horror film.  The characters are incredibly flawed, but not by the mere stupidity that marks most modern horror films.  Barbara is understandibly hysterical while the Coopers and Ben argue about what to do.  The lack of teamwork between the characters may be their defeat.<br /><br />But it's the film's conclusion that ultimately makes this film more than run of the mill horror.  The quiet music, radio communications and still photos at the end credits are unlike any other movie I've seen and must've moved the audiences from fright to pure shock back in 68.<br /><br />If you are to purchase this film, go with the excellent Millenium edition.  It's probably the highest priced version, but worth every penny - with a beautiful remastering job and direct involvment with all the filmakers.  It included an interesting final audio interview with Duane Jones, the actor who played Ben, regarding how he became detached from the film, but still proud of it.  There's also an audio commentary, parts of an early film from Romero and a weird Night of the Living Dead parody - with bread of all things. As to how it holds up - turn your lights down and watch it alone at night - then ask yourself if it holds up.  It's more than effects that make a movie a horror film and Romero demonstrates that here.</p></body></html>

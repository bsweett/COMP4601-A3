There weren't any major surprises, the acting was decent, and the special effects were big. I was kind of disappointed there weren't a few more natural disasters added into the mix, but other than that things were good.<br /><br />The story revolves around climatologist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) who after years of research comes up with a theory about global warming and a possible coming ice age that most other scientists blow off as being too extreme.  However, not long after, Jack's theory seems to be coming true as tornadoes rip through L.A. and softball size hail rains down in Tokyo, Japan. Reports come in that the temperatures of the world's oceans are decreasing at an alarming rate. Meanwhile, Jack's son Sam is off to a scholastic competition in New York. A day or so later, New York gets hit with a tidal wave and then it starts to snow. Jack realizes that New York will soon be at the center of a major deep freeze and he sets forth to rescue his son.<br /><br />The movie play out the way you expect it to play out and other than a few plot holes, is rather enjoyable. As a sidenote, the theory about global warming in the movie seems far-fetched. However, I found it rather fascinating. The film portrays a possible way that tropical climates could become areas of frozen ice and snow in a matter of minutes. In general, modern scientists don't believe it's possible for nature (science) to act so rapidly--after all evolution takes time. That's why the theory in the movie has been thrown off by "real" scientists as having little validity and an impossibility. But what seems most unlikely is sometimes the thing that is most plausible--is there a better explanation about frozen woolly mammoths found in artic areas containing tropical vegetation in their stomachs? Once you set your hands to the plow, there's no turning back.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Really Deserves 2 1/2 Stars..."></head><body><p>MOTS from the invisible Wachowski brothers.  'Matrix Revolutions' is really two movies: 1) The boring, gibberish-laden love, philosophy, and technospeak sequences, and 2) the exciting, spectacular effects action portions, mostly contained in the last hour of the film.<p>The plot is pretty much the same muddled gunk that we saw in the first two films, rife with long treatises that really don't seem to mean much of anything. A notable example is the meandering speech by the Frenchman (aka 'The Merovingian') in the dance club - what the heck was that?  I dare say that the writing quality diminished with each sequel...<p>Thankfully, there is notably less grandiose posturing by the Morpheus character in this 3rd episode (Laurence Fishburne); he actually seems to have an inferiority complex sitting next to Jada Pinkett's ship pilot.  Neo (Keanu Reeves) seems less confident in his 'The One' capabilities.  Of course, he summons up the strength he needs by the big finale.<p>The action sequences were simply spectacular.  When the giant boring machines pierce Zion's walls, hordes of Sentinels pour in, to be met by a hail of fire from the phalanx of APUs awaiting below (the Sentinel 'clouds' appear to be based on massive schools of fish, flowing in unison).  It is truly a huge battle, taking up nearly 20 minutes of screen time.  When Neo meets Smith for the final battle, it is truly cataclysmic, with explosions of water, rock, and buildings that approach nuclear in scale.<p>Overall, this film deserves to be rated right in the middle: 2 1/2 stars.  The shallowness of the characters, babbling dialogue, and stereotypical love story are balanced by awesome effects work.  What is lacking here is a great story to work with.  In my mind, this trilogy is a long way from what is now the consensus definitive example of the genre: Lord of the Rings.  The Matrix series seemed to get worse with each episode from a plot standpoint, while 'LOTR' built up to a crescendo with 'Return of the King'.  The Matrix filmakers did not have the luxury (or difficulty) of having a true classic piece of literature to base their work on.  Because of this, 'Matrix Revolutions' is pretty easy to forget after watching.</p></body></html>

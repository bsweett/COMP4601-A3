Now, this is no crime, when one looks at the success of the Spiderman, X-Men, and more recently Fantastic Four movies, and other pictures that have developed even video games into movies, with moderate success. But most of those had a wider recongition base, and global audience to work from leaving this feeling very "special interest". So I understand it, Aeon Flux is a relatively successful animated pulp magazine/storybook, and previous short TV series on Liquid TV that has been around for some time, and has a reasonable following amongst the adolescent community. The picture however, starts from the false assumption that you are familiar with the storyline, characters, and chronology of the aforementioned books. As faithful and appealing as that may be to hard core fans, it does tend to leave the uninitiated viewer out in the cold, so to speak. I spent the first 30 minutes or so wondering what the hell was going on, and although I picked up the idea (and a nice SciFi idea it is) the script and action had more holes than a block of Swiss cheese. Often movies like this, bypass the theater and head straight to their intended target audience in the DVD section, and gambling on a major release with the injection of big name actors, is a very hit or miss affair (anyone remember Spawn?)<br /><br />Theron is certainly visually distracting in a seemingly endless wardrobe of leather and spandex, and the rest of the cast DO follow through their dialogue with conviction, but it simply isn't enough. The end result comes out like a ruined surprise souffl&eacute;, with plenty of promise, but flat as a pancake. Considering the short 93 min running time, some back story would have been more than feasible, and would have helped the movie immensely; also a little more concise editing would have been a welcome addition to the often choppy direction you see on screen. Overall, this isn't a bad movie, but it's really not very good either, and sadly the inventive story and initial ideas ended up being way too large for its own production leaving a watery popcorn flick for the MTV generation. Wait for the DVD!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One Of The Greatest Fantasy Action Movies Ever"></head><body><p>One of the best, most exhilirating and purely Enjoyable movies around.  Admittedly it's not as plausible as some of the other comic book adaptations have managed to be (the "X-Men" movies and especially "Batman Begins", for example), requiring a couple of suspensions of disbelief here and there (though I'd contend that it comes off as more believable than, say, the James Bond or Rambo series).  That's not a putdown on those movies but they're not trying to be ultra-realistic, and neither is this.  What it is going for, and succeeds at much better than most action movies in my opinion, is to be a rocket ride with a plot and engaging characters.  It's sexy, it's intense at the right times, sweet and tender at the right times, mysterious at the right times, and explosive allout action at the right times, with a welcome romantic angle and with good humor without becoming an unfortunate self-parody.<br /><br />To be honset, it's not really accurate to the comic book version of Elektra (neither was her portrayal in "Daredevil") but that wasn't a fatal flaw with me like it would be with some other comic adaptations - the first four live-action "Batman"s for example - five if you count the 60s one - were technically well done (uh, 3 of them were anyway.  The other 2 I felt missed the mark even on a technical level) but were disappointing because I wanted something far closer to the comics (and finally got it this summer!)  Elektra, on the other hand, I've read some of the books she's in and want to read more (I really must get around to the run of the series Greg Rucka wrote) but she's never been a personal favorite, and in fact I like this movie version of her quite a bit better.  Those who are really into the Elektra mythos from the comics the way I am with Batman or the Hulk or The Spectre or certain others may be disappointed by the differences.<br /><br />I knew next to nothing of the plot of this going into this and liked it this way, as almost everything was unexpected that way.  People have complained that it was a slow starter; I prefer that it took the time to build itself up.  I'm going to opt not to say too much about the storyline - the box description is deliberately vague and I think it was intentional that people not know where this was going to take them when they watch it (too many movies today, including some of the greatest, give away far too much in their previews) although that may have cost it at the box office.  Personally, I'm inclined to wonder if it's part of a trend where action movies with female protagonists aren't taken seriously.  Not many seem to do the same mega-business as the big budget action movies with bigname male stars.  It doesn't seem to be like that with other fields of movies - horror, comedy, drama, etc. - but action with a female on the marquee seems to be a bit of a hard sell lately.  I thought it was a very good change of pace to have the female be the central figure this time around, instead of the backup.  If I, for one, was in death-defying danger, personally I think Jennifer Garner in tight red leather would be a fine individual to come to the rescue.<br /><br />But as for who rescues who and who endangers who and what the sides are, not everything's immediately clear in this one.  There are some unexpected turns, and some great characters to take the those turns.  Speaking of characters, some of them I did recognize from the books, others I'm not sure if they were created for the movie or not.  Either way, there are some compelling players in this show.<br /><br />I loved this, hope it does enough on DVD to warrant a sequel, and whole-heartily recommend it.  As noted, it's not the most true-to-the-book adaptations of late, but it's one of the best, and that's saying quite a lot considering the bumper crop of comic-derived movies over the last few years.  Excellent.</p></body></html>

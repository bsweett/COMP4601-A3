Against the beautiful and often treacherous natural landscape, we experience the full spectrum of existence, gaining profound insights into the nature of being. Those who are so critical of Treadwell shouldn't take out their angst on the film. The film is very well made and is done by one who is obviously accomplished at his craft. Documentaries are about exploring subjects in great detail and this film succeeds at many levels; such as upsetting so many people!</p></body></html>

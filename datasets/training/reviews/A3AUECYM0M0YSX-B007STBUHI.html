<meta name="summary" content="Strange and somewhat unsatisfactory remastering of a classic"></head><body><p>It almost feels pointless to review the movie here: unless you've been living on Neptune for the past 25 years you've probably seen it, probably can quote lines from it, probably know it inside-out. And that's why I'm partly annoyed by this new DVD release. The music and sound effects have been reworked for modern home stereo systems, which is not bad in itself, but while John Williams' justly famous score is greatly enhanced (in gorgeously clear stereo; the theatrical mastering was rather murky and of course in mono) some of the sound effects have been re-recorded or re-created. (Few movie viewers realize how many sound effects--door slamming, footsteps, even background voices--are overdubbed long after the scenes are shot) I assume this re-recording was because the sound elements had to be be remixed to give us stereo, but with a film this old it's probably impossible to find all the original bits of sound after all this time. So many of the sounds are new to this release. To someone who's not that familiar with the film it's probably not a big deal, but some of the new sounds are oddly chosen--the shark doesn't explode with much of a bang now but with a dull thud; there's a bright side, though: the bullet no longer ricochets!) The sound as the shark smashes through the glass window of the boat near the end is closer to a coke bottle breaking than a large window shattering. Some sound effects are missing completely: a car door in Mrs. Kintner's second scene, the gun being cocked as Brody's about to fire on the shark at the end of the film. The whale sound they hear inside the Orca at night has been *completely* changed--they didn't even try to find something that sounded like the original whale! The splashing and thudding as the shark is ripping the cleats out of the boat has been toned down considerably, and the ripping sound as the cleats give way is absent. We hear the dialogue in the scene better--something I never could do either in the theater or on VHS--but it also makes the event less ferocious. Some of the music cues are actually different takes than those used in the original mix, with slightly altered orchestrations and entry-points. (It's not unusual for composers to rework orchestrations on the spot while they're recording the soundtrack.) Some sound effects have been added that enhance nothing and seem to be there just as stereo effects to make the movie feel more contemporary.  The most annoying to me personally is the scene where Mrs. Brody is quietly trying to clear the table after dinner while her husband sits deep in thought and troubled.  She's obviously trying to not make noise, yet they've added loud stereo &quot;scraping&quot; of plates being lifted off the dining room table.  Spoils the wonderfully pensive mood of Williams' music at that point and is completely unnecessary.  It feels like they just have to remind you every moment that can that this is a STEREO remastering.  Woo-hoo.<p>This may seem picky, and many won't notice or care, but at the same time I don't appreciate them messing with a classic, especially when they don't offer a choice of a second audio channel with the original Dolby mix, as is given with many DVDs. And I don't hold with the trend when remastering movies today of making ordinary gunshots sound like cannon fire.  (And one of the new gunshots is actually not synched with the smoke that comes from Brody's gun.)<p>If I've harped too much on the negative, I should say the video part looks beauiful (a cinematographer's small gaff with the aperture has even been fixed--I assume digitally--for this version) and the music has been, as I said, superbly restored. (This is particularly effective in the underwater music when they find Ben Gardner's boat.) But some key sound effects were dealt with poorly, and I'm surprised 1) the film received such cavalier treatment, and 2) nobody but me seems to have noticed.<p>The disc also includes several theatrical and TV trailers, a &quot;making-of&quot; documentary, and the usual goodies--production photos, storyboards, etc. There are outtakes (just a few and I know there were far more than this in the film) and deleted scenes, including three scenes that *were* included when the film was shown on network TV to add extra running time. But even one of these scenes is not complete on this DVD. I'm referring to Quint's original introduction, where he hums the Ode to Joy while a schoolboy plays it on a clarinet. That scene starts not where the DVD begins but with a shot of Quint exiting his truck, which has his name painted in big letters on the door. This is shown on the DVD as a production still but not in the deleted scenes themselves, for some odd reason. I just wonder why they give you *some* of a deleted scene but not all.<p>As for the story itself, a few things stand out: this film had some terrific dialogue and insightful scenes of family life, throwaway bits that show Spielberg once had a heart and soul. He'd never direct the film like this today, with 2/3 of it over before we get any real action and with endless pages of character exposition. Perhaps this is why I haven't been interested in a Spielberg movie in 20 years. The shark looks very fake in some scenes, but somehow we never seem to care--it still works. There are the usual maddeningly irrational plot points in a Spielberg film: why does the police chief go out with Hooper to look for the shark (when they discover Ben Gardner's boat)? Why does the mayor make such a big deal out of the fact that Hooper can't produce the giant tooth when there's a boat that's clearly had the crap chewed out of it by something? Why does the chief go out with Hooper and Quint at all in a town filled with professional fisherman who cold serve as deckhands? And once on the boat with an increasingly mad and unreasonable Quint, who is endangering everyone, why doesn't Brody put Quint under arrest and with the help of Hooper guide the Orca safely back to shore before Quint trashes it? Would a law enforcement officer really be so passive in that situation?<p>Well, the answer to all of these is because otherwise we'd have a far shorter film and less fun with the shark. Most people will just be thrilled to have Jaws in widescreen (this was the first VHS cassette I ever bought, many years ago, and the dub was horrible), and in larger-than-life sound. So am I, but I wish they'd preserved the original soundtrack mixdown as well. (Note: Watch for quick cameos by author Peter Benchley as a TV reporter and &quot;Blues Brothers&quot; director John Landis as a skinny denim-shirted fisherman who's one of those trying to win Mrs. Kintner's bounty.) (This review refers to the Widescreen 20th Anniversary stereo edition, NOT the DTS edition, which I have not heard and have no knowledge about.)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="May be violent but it's oh so fun"></head><body><p>In one of my favorite films Aliens, besides one scene involving a chestburster, it's literally gore free. That is until the end when a certain artificial person gets a messy end(doesn't die but might as well be). So what happens is that one moment of gore seems more amplified because the rest of the film was completely free of it. So it is too with this film, it starts out with some violence but nothing too over the top and then boom, gore galore.<br /><br />Seth and Richard Gecko are wanted by many a government officer and need to get into Mexico, only Mexico's border crossing has more cops than before. So they kidnap a small family and break through and end up where they need to:  a seedy biker bar named the T***y Twister. A thing goes awry and the bar's workers shows their real faces: vampires. So begins a fight to survive the night.<br /><br />The 2 distinct styles of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino are shown in a nice hybrid. Robert's penchant for fast editing mixes with Quentin's long takes and Quentin's usual snappy dialogue. It's funny that many people considered Quentin an influential director injecting a new type of film and dialogue into film, despite getting ideas from other films. The guys named after colors in Reservoir Dogs was from a different film, the many references in Kill Bill. So it's nice to see something that isn't so obviously familiar to film geeks.<br /><br />The extras are definately great. You get a long documentary on the making of the movie, a featurette, deleted scenes such as more gory moments(and you thought the human being as a guitar was bad) and Robert doing commentary on his film school like features. Also it contains Robert and the very first and to date only commentary(I believe) with Quentin Tarantino and its neat seeing their differences: Robert, composed calm and descriptive while Quentin is his usual hyperkinetic self.<br /><br />So may not like the obvious split from the Pulp Fiction/Reservoir Dogs like opening to the big Kill Bill 1 ending last half but it's what makes that second half all the more cool and this movie is cool.</p></body></html>

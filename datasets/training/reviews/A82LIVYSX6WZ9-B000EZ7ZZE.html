<meta name="summary" content="beware the crappy sequel"></head><body><p>Resident Evil: Apocalypse is a gargantuan bomb of a movie and why do you ask is beacause it is just plain horrible. Bad writing, acting and the action set pieces are mind numbingly crappy and non exciting. This sequel takes place right after the original in the desolate town of Racoon City where the virus has spread even more and the inhabitants become zombies. Just like the first one this suffers but the first one was a notch better in my mind. Starring Mill Jovovich (Resident Evil, The Fifth Element), Oded Fehr (The Mummy and The Mummy Returns), Mike Epps (Next Friday, Friday After Next), Jared Harris (I Shot Andy Warhol, Igby Goes Down) and Alan Tudyk (28 Days, Tv's Firefly). I hated everything about this movie and the Nemesis creature was laugh out loud funny. This bored the hell out of me. I gotta say this goes down the line for being so retarded like Van Helsing was. The chick who played Jill Valentine and the others sprouted some awful dialouge. "im good but not that good" please. For die hard fans of Resident Evil but beware, these people dont know how to make a good movie if it bit them in the ass. I don't really care what other's say..hey, at least I got some taste. This movie is for no-brainers.</p></body></html>

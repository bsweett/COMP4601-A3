<meta name="summary" content="THE DVD OF A REMARKABLE FILM EPIC!"></head><body><p>&quot;Patton&quot; remains one of the most ambitious WWII films ever mounted. The film's grand battles and outstanding visual effects are complimented by George C. Scott's performance as George Patton, who gave us all a taste of what it's like to lust for war. The DVD features a fine digital transfer of the film (the dialogue is overshadowed by sound effects at times, and this is the only reason I don't give it a full five stars), complete with  an intermission brake, as well as theatrical trailers for this film, the epic D-Day film &quot;The Longest Day,&quot; and the ill-conceived &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot; The DVD also features a commentary track by a Patton historian! I recommend this DVD to all those who love war films.<br />Movie Grade: A+ (5 Stars)<br />DVD Grade: A- (4 Stars).</p></body></html>

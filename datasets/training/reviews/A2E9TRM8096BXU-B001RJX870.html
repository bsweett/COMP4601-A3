<meta name="summary" content="Shattering."></head><body><p>DOWNFALL is possibly the best German-language film I have ever seen about the Second World War. It sets a new and impressive standard that will be very hard to beat and serves notice on hack film-makers everywhere that depicting historical figures as cartoon images of good or evil is no longer acceptable with the modern audience.<br /><br />There have been a number of films and programs over the years about Hitler's last days on earth, and if you watched DOWNFALL, you've probably seen one or more them. They vary widely in quality, but the performance which pops into my mind most readily is that of Stephen Berkoff in the 12-part "War & Remembrance" mini-series. Berkoff is a fine actor, but he was handcuffed to a script which was predicated on the false image of Hitler as a carpet-chewing lunatic who reacted to the slightest setback by throwing a screaming fit and ordering someone shot. This image was partially an echo of wartime propaganda, and partly stemmed from books penned by surviving generals who wanted to lay the blame for the war's defeat exclusively at Hitler's boots. A more accurate description of the man came from Albert Speer, who said "Hitler was a genius wrestling with a demon, and the demon won."<br /><br />This image is precisely the one conveyed by veteran Swiss actor Bruno Ganz, who plays Hitler as a man who in private often took on the role of a kindly, absent-minded professor-grandpa, but when frustrated, thwarted or betrayed (as he frequently was in the last months of his life) showed an inner character reminiscent of a hateful child -- full of misanthropy and an arrogant kind of self-pity. Ganz's performance is simply epic. And when does finally throw the "Hitler tantrum" you know is coming, you can't take your eyes off the man. Wow.<br /><br />The decision to depict Hitler as a human being will clearly irritate people who prefer to see him as Satan incarnate. The NEW YORKER review posted here is visible evidence of this, stating: "The attempt to re-create Hitler in realistic terms has always been morally and imaginatively questionable-a compromise with the unspeakable that borders on complicity with it." Thankfully, Hirschbiegel and Ganz paid no mind to this type of simple-minded drivel when they made the film. They understood, as the audience does, that to demonize Hitler lets humanity off the hook for producing him in the first place.<br /><br />Thomas Kretschmann (as SS-Gruppenf&uuml;hrer Hermann Fegelein) is another scene-stealer. Kretschmann portrays the handsome, oily opportunist who married Eva Braun's sister and used his SS rank as a license to amass a criminal fortune as a dyed-in-the-wool bastard who is as charming as they come -- just the type of cynical crook that flourished in the moral wasteland that the Third Reich ultimately became, and just the type that was first to jump ship when it all went south.<br /><br />Hitler's secretary, Traudl Junge, is played ably by lovely Alexandra Maria Lara. Like many people around Hitler, she seemed to be unable to form a consistent opinion of him and her inner conflict is well conveyed on the screen. Other terrific performances are delivered by Corinna Harfouch (as creepy Magda Goebbels), Juliane K&ouml;hler (as the very likeable Eva Braun), Christian Berkel (as Prof. Dr. Ernst-G&uuml;nter Schenck, a kindly and heroic SS doctor), Michael Mendl (General der Artillerie Helmuth Weidling, a true soldier in the old German mold, who responds to a threat to have him shot by grasping his Knight's Cross and snarling, "Do you see this? Don't you dare take that tone with me!", and sinister nebbish Ulrich Noethen as the back-stabbing Reichsf&uuml;hrer SS Heinrich Himmler. There is also a fine turn by G&ouml;tz Otto as Hitler's SS Adjutant, Hauptsturmf&uuml;hrer Otto G&uuml;nsche, a hulking brute of a man who serves as a two-legged counterpart to Hitler's faithful dog, Blondi.<br /><br />Unlike some German war films I've seen, DOWNFALL's battle scenes are well-directed, and the technical execution of the film is superb. The movie is mercifully light on moralizing, letting the horrifying images on the screen speak for themselves. I have very few criticisms of the film. The interview scenes with the real Traudl Junge, who dutifilly condemns herself for getting involved with Hitler, seem tacked-on, forced, and generally PC. The battle scenes show nothing of the wonton rape committed by Soviet soldiers in Berlin (so many German women were raped that East Berliners later dubbed the statue put up there by communist authorities commemorating Soviet dead as "the tomb of the unknown rapist"). And the movie is about 15 - 20 minutes too long. But these are very minor points. In DOWNFALL, Oliver Hirschbiegel has directed a film that stands comfortably with the best WW 2 movies of all time. Terrific.</p></body></html>

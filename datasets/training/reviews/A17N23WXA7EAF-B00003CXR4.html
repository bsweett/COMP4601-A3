Crouching Tiger lovers believe that this is the quintessential martial arts movie or that it is a profound reflection of Chinese history, culture, and drama. While the fighting scenes in this movie, are thrilling and fun to watch, they are more acrobatic and fantastic than anything else. I think that's what Ang Lee intended, and I'll explain why in a moment. As to the cultural significance of this film, there really isn't one unless you are interested in obscure academic topics such as the sociological significance of Chinese martial arts soap operas.<p>And there lies the key: this film is essentially a supped up martial arts soap opera. Martial Arts soap operas are wildly popular throughout Asia and on many American TV stations with Asian language programs. I've seen many of them on Chinese TV programs in the US and China, and my wife used to watch them every weekend in the Southeast Asian city where she grew up. <p>Martial Arts soap operas often feature the same themes as Crouching Tiger, such as avenging the master's death, restoring a treasure to its rightful owner, rescuing a damsel in distress, unrequited love, etc. They also feature many of the same combat scenarios including fighters flying at each other through the air, roof top chases, sword duels, ambushes, miracle healing, and so forth. These films are neither meant to showcase true martial arts performances like some of Jet Li's earlier works, or countless Main Land Chinese Kung Fu movies, nor are they intended to bring Chinese history to life. Instead, they are genre-driven, formulaic, fun, and often absurd.<p>Does this mean that Crouching Tiger is a bad movie-absolutely not! I think Ang Lee quite deliberately set out to make a high-end, jazzed up martial arts soap opera. The first time I saw this movie in San Francisco, the largely Chinese audience enthusiastically applauded after the first fight scene, as did my wife and I. We had all seen this sort of thing hundreds of times before but never on such a magnificent scale with so much realism, grandeur, and suspense. Ang Lee pushed the martial arts soap opera genre to the limit, and he did so superbly. <p>As the months went by I usually heard one of two responses to this film. The majority of people liked it but often claimed that it was deep, profound and revealing to them-that it taught them something about Chinese culture. The film's detractors on the other hand found the fight scenes unbelievable and the plot too melodramatic. I think both sets of people failed to realize that all they were watching was a really well done martial arts soap opera.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A well-done, very disturbing movie..."></head><body><p>For starters, it's obvious that people either loved or hated this movie. And it's not hard to see why. You either buy into its sentimentality and the magic, or you don't. If you don't buy into it, you are going to hate this movie because it keeps serving you large servings of it for more than three hours. If you do buy into it, you are in for an emotionally draining and disturbing experience. I'm still digesting it, frankly, and I can't quite say yet if I'm happy that I saw it.<br />Is it well acted? Yes, but remember the emphasis is on sentiment. If you don't buy sentimentality, you won't like the acting.<br />How about the story? Like most Stephen King, there are several twists and turns and a couple of miracles along the way. It also has an incredibly disturbing execution scene that I fear did damage to my synapses permanently. I don't need that from my &quot;entertainment.&quot; This is not a movie for the faint of heart. However, in some ways it is, because people who are not yet supercynical -- the bleeding hearts out there -- are most likely to get caught up in the film.<br />Another frequent complaint is the length. I'm of two minds about that too. In general I like longer movies. You become more enveloped in the characters, more immersed in the world, but this is still a heck of a long movie when, frankly, not all that much actually happens. I think the director could have easily sliced 20-30 minutes without sacrificing any of the story.<br />As far as the ending, I'm not going to give it away like some others here do (you are forewarned), but it is more complex than the previous work by the Frank Darabont/Stephen King crew, The Shawshank Redemption. It is a proper ending to the movie, but anybody taking away simple emotions from this movie didn't quite get it, in my view. Shawshank, by the way, I wholeheartedly endorse, as a superior movie. Shawshank is one of the best movies I've ever seen, that leaves you emotionally drained and completely satisfied. The Green Mile has left me drained, but with a sense of unease that I can't quite put my hands on.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Eastern Promises Movie Review"></head><body><p>David "Bloodthirsty" Cronenberg weaves a Russian Mafia story with slashed throats, seedy characters and an unclad Viggo Mortensen. Trying hard to mimic the sincerity and violent appeal of The Godfather, while adding occasional helpings of dramatic revenge and redemption, Eastern Promises is incredibly entertaining and sadly short-lived. So much potential lays in the crafty construction of the dashing, cool and baleful lead character, yet the film abruptly resolves with a succinct running time and too-brief satisfaction.<br /><br />Anna (Naomi Watts) discovers the diary of a young girl who dies at her hospital, leaving a newborn baby behind. In her attempts to get the mysterious Russian book translated, she comes across the deceptively calm Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl) who has insidious ties with the Eastern European crime syndicate Vory V Zakone, and may be involved with the pregnant girl's death. Semyon's brash son Kirill (Vincent Cassel) and his menacingly arcane chauffeur Nikolai Luzhin (Viggo Mortensen) must decide with whom their allegiances lay as bodies pile up and secrets become uncovered.<br /><br />Viggo Mortensen's performance is unabashedly outstanding, and tops his previous role in Cronenberg's "A History of Violence". Both characters carry sordid pasts and troubled consciences, but Eastern Promises' Nikolai exudes slickness with his snazzy black getup and unflinching, piercing gaze. He is the ultimate dark-robed gangster henchman, and grabs the viewer's attention like a knife to the eye. From the moment he is introduced, subtleties and foreshadowing elude to a deeper and more complex character than what is so suavely displayed on the calmly cold exterior.<br /><br />If violence begets realism then Eastern Promises is as real as it gets. Cronenberg's penchant for delivering imagery unlike any seen before is certainly evident here, this time in the form of a bathhouse fight sequence that transcends violence as we know it. A gritty air of believability draws us into the seedy underworld of the Russian Mafia that Cronenberg has created and scathingly dark images keep reality cemented wherever the masterful director chooses. It's not quite violence for violence's sake, (though it comes ever so close) and this history of violence demands our attention - and gets it. A powerful tool for commanding seriousness, such brazen displays of carnage from an unflinching camera seem destined for cathartic release, though when none is truly offered, audiences may have to create their own at the highest point of the excessive brutality. Other than the aforementioned scene of agonizingly vicious bloodshed, Eastern Promises actually feels lacking in an overall body count, as one would hope to follow Nikolai in a journey of vengeance and usurpation, but the real rampage against villainy likely lies just beyond the end credits.<br /><br />The dark and brooding world of the Russian Mafia is not one we're used to seeing, and such a fascinating existence requires an epic story. At a running time shy of two hours however, Cronenberg's foray into this seedy underworld feels sadly cut short and truncated at its climax. Before the brutal power struggle can come full circle, the film is over and we're left briefly satisfied while quickly realizing we want more. Eastern Promises is a fitting title as it does just that - it promises an epic story of mystery, deception, and revenge, but doesn't quite deliver as much as it should. Regardless, fans of the genre and Cronenberg's style will be delighted to see just how far the director pushes the boundaries of violence to tell an intriguingly morbid tale of survival.<br /><br />- The Massie Twins</p></body></html>

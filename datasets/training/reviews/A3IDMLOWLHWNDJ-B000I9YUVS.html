<meta name="summary" content="This Remake Of "The Fog" Is About As Scary As Mist From A Windex Bottle"></head><body><p>Ask why John Carpenter gave the go ahead for this bastardization of a remake & his reply is,<br /> "Why not!? Everyone else is doin' it!"<br />Yeah, but that doesn't mean YOU should do it.<br />But, nevertheless, here it is a remake to Carpenter's 1980 classic that sucks like the biggest black hole with no ending in sight ("The Fog" will land with a thud on DVD January 24th, 2006 in it's original PG-13 format or in an unrated format, either way the film still sucks).<br /><br />The plot is still the same: Antonio Island or Bay (take your pick) is celebrating its 125 years of existence. A new monument to the towns three founding fathers has been erected right out in front of town hall. But, their is an ominous backstory to the town's origins & the citizens of Antonio Island are going to pay for it with their very lives. An unholy fog has rolled onto shore mysteriously killing anyone in its path. Its up to the towns descendents to figure out the mystery of the fog before its too late.<br /><br />Carpenter is without a doubt one of the true masters of suspense & horror. With the 1980 original version to "The Fog" he brought a great ghost story to the screen with the right amount of atmosphere, suspense, & with his trademark score "The Fog" remains one of his best films.<br /><br />The remake, however, is a different story entirely. Its crap. Every single frame of this film sucks.<br /><br />The characters are two-dimensional & after seeing the original a few times over the years, I couldn't really visualize anyone else in these roles. Tom Welling, Selma Blair & the entire cast are an absolute waste. Blair doesn't have the purr that Adrienne Barbeau had as Stevie Wayne, Welling wasn't believable as Castle let alone a fisherman, & the Father Malone & Old Man Macon characters get little less than 5 minutes of screentime - combined.<br /><br />The tweaking of the original story is really lame. Did we really need to see the whole backstory of the Elizabeth Dane plotline? Hal Holbrook's, Father Malone did a perfect job of reading from his grandfather's diary with out the need of one flashback, or an extra tug from his drinking flask! Has American society become so fu**ing attention defecit disorientated that we need to have everything spelled out for us? Leave a lot to the imagination - it's more creepier that way.<br /><br />The ending is the worst insult to Carpenter fans. What in the hell were they thinking?! I was so pissed off when I left the theatre & I have come to the conclusion that John Carpenter can't truly be trusted (hey folks, he gave the nod for this remake). What's next "Halloween: The Musical"?!<br /><br />"The Fog" is to be avoided like a bad case of seasickness.</p></body></html>

Well, the movie went nowhere, told us nothing, and was nothing but one guy talking to a volleyball.  Sound exciting?  I mean, even if you like Tom Hanks it wouldn't bring up the quality of the movie.  The sustaining forces of this movie were Wilson, the infamous volleyball, and the &quot;undelivered package,&quot; which really means nothing held it together.  Now, obvioulsy I do not recommend this movie to you, but I do agree that you should at least see it once, and maybe that friend you have that says they &quot;like&quot; it will show it to you for free.  It is not worth the money, and I saw it in theatres!</p></body></html>

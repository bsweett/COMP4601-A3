<meta name="summary" content="Lovely little film!"></head><body><p>A suprise hit.  The author and star on this movie hits the nail right on the head.  She's 30, her family sees her as over the hill, her father is overbearing, her mother overfeeds her, and she's at her wits end.  The story is totally believable and why shouldn't it be?  Nia Vardalos lived the story and lived to tell the tale. Vardalos stars as Toula Portokalos, a quiet, shy, insecure girl growing up Greek.  She wants to experience the outside world but her father won't have it.  When she finally does meet a man that has interest in her, her father goes nuts.  There can be no marriage because he's not Greek.  A tragedy!  There are a lot of laughs.  Especially when the Toula's cousin  reveals the bridesmaids dresses.<br /><br />By the way, look for Nia Vardalos' real life husband in the film.  He plays the groom's best friend.</p></body></html>

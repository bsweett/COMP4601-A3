<meta name="summary" content="Familiar Theme, Slightly Confusing Results: Good Showcase of Adrian Brody's Acting Talent"></head><body><p>For all the familiar premises of quasi-time traveling and `what if' scenario, and its (intentionally) confusing conclusion, `The Jacket' still is worth your time simply because it has Adrian Brody. If the film falls short of more skillful narrative of other mind-boggling thrillers like, say, `Memento,' Adrian Brody shines as the tormented hero of the film, whose body (or mind) travels back and forth between the two years - 1992 and 2007.<br /><br />Arian Brody plays Jack Starks, a veteran solider who just returned from the Gulf War after receiving a near fatal injury in the head. Actually, he was once thought dead, but he miraculously comes back to life. As if his `first death' (so he calls) is not enough, however, Jack experiences another terrible incident after meeting a little girl and her mother (Kelly Lynch) on the snowy road, and a young car driver (Brad Renfro) who picks him up.<br /><br />Arrested for the death of a police officer, Jack, who denies the charge, is sent to a mental institute, where Thomas Becker (Kris Kristofferson) gives him a very radical treatment. Put in a straitjacket, Jack is locked in a small drawer in a morgue-like basement room.<br /><br />And a strange thing happens. Jack finds he is in the year 2007, and after meeting a lonely and beautiful woman Jackie (Keira Knightley), he knows that he - I mean, Jack -- died on January 1st, 1993 - only a week after he was first put in the drawer. How did (or will) he die? And how can he save the lives of those who had died during the lost 15 years?<br /><br />Jennifer Jason Leigh appears as doctor who gives Jack a help, and Daniel Craig as one of the inmates in the institute.<br /><br />[CONFUSING, BUT GETS BETTER AS IT UNFOLDS] So, did you get the story? I'm afraid not, but keep watching. The film's earlier part is rather confusing and unnecessarily repetitious, and it lacks enough explanation to engage the viewers' attention. `The Jacket' takes too much time to set up its rules, and the rules themselves are not particularly original. The film attempts to include as many potentially intriguing themes as possible in less than 2 hours, but fails to fully utilize its ideas. Consequently, some behavior of the characters looks unreasonable, especially when Jack tries to explain his identity and motives to the people in 2007. And its obligatory love scene is very disappointing.<br /><br />[ADRIAN BRODY'S FILM] `The Jacket' is a showcase for the talent of Adrian Brody, who can so easily and effortlessly embody the central character's tragic life. One strange thing is the film is directed by John Maybury, British director whose films I thought are art-house films. I don't know whether or not he is the first choice of Steven Soderbergh, one of the 19 producers of the film (including George Clooney), but I am not sure that Maybury is the right director to handle the material even though obviously his name had attracted such names as Keira Knightly and Daniel Craig, the latter being seen in the same director's "Love Is the Devil: Study for a Portrait of Francis Bacon."<br /><br />`The Jacket' is not a fast roller-coaster ride of `Butterfly Effect.' It aims for something slower, and perhaps more intelligent, without losing its value as entertainment. The result is a curious mixture of `Twilight Zone' and love romance. Though it is not a great success as either of them, it is more interesting than other films with similar topics.</p></body></html>

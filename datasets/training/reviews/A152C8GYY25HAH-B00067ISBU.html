My cousins, who lived a couple of miles away, got to read them, but they couldn't go to any movie that wasn't rated G. My siblings and I got to see almost any movie. Looking back, I think we got the better deal. Our horizons were broadened through film far more than by reading comic books.<br /><br />When it comes to movies based on these books, I can see them only as movies, since I don't have much knowledge of the source material. I can't tell you how faithful "Hellboy" is to its comic book origins, but I can tell you it's an inventive, energetic movie.<br /><br />This dark comic fable begins near the end of World War II. The German Nazi high command, knowing it is about to lose the war, launches and effort to bring forth The Forces of Evil. The plan is intercepted by The Allies just in time by a commando squad. The one demon raised by the Nazis, Hellboy [Ron Perleman], is taken into custody. Raised in a secret location in the United States by the leader of the commandos, Hellboy learns to be a force for good. In the present day, all hell breaks loose, so to speak, and only Hellboy can save the planet from the forces of darkness.<br /><br />In translating to a movie, a comic book is no different from a literary masterpiece. To be successful, the movie has to succeed on its own terms. Having not read the original, be it `high' art or `low', shouldn't be an encumbrance to liking and understanding the film. "Hellboy' succeeds brilliantly.</p></body></html>

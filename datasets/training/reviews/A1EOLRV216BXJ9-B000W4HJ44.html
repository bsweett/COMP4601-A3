And by all standards, this is such a hilarious and cheerful musical. Its success owe much to its excellent balance of great dance numbers and everyone has their turn to lead in the spotlight. For the first half, I am captivated by the singing and dancing Tracey, she is so beautiful and so plus size! Then it is her classmates' turn, the vibrant black youths in the detention class, singing even more beautifully and leap so high in the air. When Mrs. Turnblad (John Travolta) showed up with her feminine features, not to mention her adorable and modest demeanor, that's worth zillions of laughs. The scene Mr. and Mrs. Turnblad (Christopher Walken) singing in the backyard can be so romantic. But I love the finale best - the way John Trovolta moves and bends, Queen Lativah sings and the group dancers twirl round and round unbelievably fast.<br /><br />As for the plot - not to discriminate against race, size and look- it may be predictable but the cast is so funny that it's still worth watching again and again. And one big surprise, to someone who can't dance (me), the 2 dance lessons in the bonus features given by the choregraphers are eye-opening. They inspire me with the "camel pull", "chicken" moves. And now I admire those dancers greatly, even more than the main characters. All right, maybe Mrs. Turnblad's final dance is still hard to beat!</p></body></html>

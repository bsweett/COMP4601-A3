<meta name="summary" content="GENIOUS - PURE GENIUS!  - BONHAM CARTER!!!!!!!!"></head><body><p>This IS HELENA BONHAM CARTER's show!  She gives us a total 3 dimensional Queen - with the "haps" and "sads" and "funnies" with just a little touch of Better Davis?  Perhaps the rings, the wig, something very next.<br /><br />DEPP is great as the Hatter - but the accents confuse - sometimes Scots, sometimes North Country.<br /><br />I loved the small touches on Hatter - bloodied finger - too many sewing needles - the thimballs .....<br /><br />COLLEEN ATWOOD's realization of the costumes are always picture perfect - down to the fabric ....... important doing period work.<br /><br />HATHAWAY, MIA W., GLOVER, the rest of the ensemble fit perfectly - this is what Carol intended us to see ...... including the dark sides ....... the moat with the heads.<br /><br />Tiny touch of "OZ" - but Alice came before "OZ" - so maybe its the reverse.<br /><br />THIS MUST be seen in IMAX - you have to be IN the picture.<br /><br />Fave?  CHESHIRE CAT natch.<br /><br />Great music by Elfman - touches of Glass ... but that's to be overlooked.</p></body></html>

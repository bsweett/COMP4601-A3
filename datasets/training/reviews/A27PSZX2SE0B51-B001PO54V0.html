<meta name="summary" content="Have a smile on my fave"></head><body><p>I am 27 years old, so the era of the big musical was well before my time.  Consequently, I've never acquired a proper taste for them.  I do admit, though, that when isolated and out of context, a good musical 'number' can be a beautiful thing: athletic grace, pin-point choreography, a snappy song, all combining together to create a whirling dervish of kinetic energy on the screen, and a visceral thrill in the heart of the audience.  But in the middle of a story, when all the characters break into (superfluous) song and dance, I get annoyed.<p>I mention the above because I've seen Gene Kelly singin' in the rain a couple of dozen times.  But I'd never seen Gene Kelly in &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot;.<p>On numerous Hollywood retrospective TV specials, Gene's damp little moment in the street is always accounted for, and I've always enjoyed it.  But I shied away from the movie because, as outlined above, I wondered how it could be as magical when my particular tastes don't want it in the movie?  Well, after having seen the full movie for the first time only recently, I'm here to report, to like-minded individuals, that it maintains all its magic and then some.  <p>This is true probably because the moment is integrated into the story.  It is the culmination of a lovely moment, and an expression of the joy overflowing.  When the other musical numbers are likewise integrated, the film works beautifully.  For a script written after the songs were chosen, with the sole purpose of swiftly getting from song to song (Hey!  Isn't this the story within the movie as well?  Self-reflexivity in a Gene Kelly picture?  Who'd have thunk it?), the story moves along at a nice pace, and rarely is there any questionable narrative logic.<p>But when the musical numbers are superfluous to the story, the film drags.  It appears padded, as if the producers found themselves in the enviable position of being severely under-budget, and decided to blow their wad on grand spectacle.  These numbers always work on their own, though.  &quot;Broadway Melody&quot; is a gargantuan set-piece that is stunning on so many levels, and includes the sensuous moves of Cyd Charisse.  &quot;Moses&quot; finds Donald O'Connor and Kelly caught in rapid-fire linguistic duel at the elocutionist's office, and then a stunning dance dyad.  But neither scene really fits into the story (although the former is almost saved by a funny tag-line).<p>Said story, when it's utilized, is actually quite clever.  Silent film stars Don Lockwood (Kelly) and Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) must learn to adapt when sound infiltrates their ranks.  One problem: Lina has a voice like an ill parakeet.  Enter Kathy Selden (Debbie Reynolds) a singing-and-dancing pixie who may solve all their problems, while she steals Don's heart.  Throw in happy-go-lucky music man Cosmo Brown (O'Connor) who lightens the mood when needed, and there's your story.  It appears quite frothy on first glance, but is really a deft satire on the Hollywood star machine.<p>The three leads are all, on top of being obviously talented, terribly charismatic.  Kelly never lets that sparkling grin leave his face, even when he's dancing with the grace of a gazelle and the power of a boxer.  O'Connor is a mess of limbs and joints, but will amaze and stun you with his vast array of near-acrobatic moves.  And Reynolds, only 20 at the time, may be unrefined and inexperienced, but she more than matches her male co-stars' energy and gusto.  And her voice, especially on &quot;Good Morning&quot;, is just so bright and cheery you can't help falling for her.  Hagen, for her part, plays a character that's both the villain and the comic foil.  She is strong in both parts of the role.<p>Besides the wonderful musical numbers, the film has a number of sharp comic moments.  Don's recapping of his and Cosmos' early career, where the myth he presents to the media doesn't match the reality, is a funny extended sequence.  The test-screening of &quot;Dueling Cavalier&quot;, Don and Lina's first sound film, is a riotous example of 'Murphy's Law'.  And of course there's O'Connor's famous &quot;Make 'Em Laugh&quot; routine, which most certainly achieves the goal of its title.<p>So against my better judgment and contrary to my prior experiences, I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot;.  Its story moved me, its comedy tickled me, and its singing and dancing wowed me.  While not nearly as coherent as I would have liked, you can't ask much more from a movie whose only goal it to entertain you.</p></body></html>

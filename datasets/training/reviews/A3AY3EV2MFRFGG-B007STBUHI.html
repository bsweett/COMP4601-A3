<meta name="summary" content="My favorite movie of all time!"></head><body><p>Nothing else has had quite the effect on me as this movie.  To me it is nearly perfect, a well crafted monster movie that seems to effortlessly invoke a sense of phobic terror whenever anyone gets anywhere near, much less in, the water.  Although Roy Scheider is a delight as Brody and Richard Dreyfuss engaging as Matt Hooper, it is the larger than life characterization of Quint by Robert Shaw that owns the movie.  Mattey's Mechanical Shark isn't half bad either, although it's constant malfunctions kept it off camera for most of the movie.  A happy accident that only served to increase the film's already considerable power.  If you haven't seen this movie yet, by all means do so asap.  They just do not make monster movies better than this.  An essential action/monster movie for any film buff's library.<p>The disc is nearly as good as the movie.  It contains numerous deleted scenes, outtakes, storyboards, and trailers.  Too bad the incredible making of documentary has been cut to about an hour in length from its original two hour running time.  Perhaps some day MCA will do another box set special edition for the DVD release and offer the restored documentary.</p></body></html>

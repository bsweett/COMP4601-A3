<meta name="summary" content="May not be your average war film, but it's one of the 'better' war films!"></head><body><p>I absolutely loved this movie, for it stands out from the crowd of generic war films and gives you a sense of realism.  Based on Anthony Swofford's memoir, `Jarhead' stays pretty faithful to it's source and delivers a unique movie going experience that thrives on the brilliant performances of it's cast, in particular Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard.  As Anthony `Swoff' Swofford (Gyllenhaal) learns to adjust to life in the Marines he soon realizes that it's not what he expected it to be.  He doesn't want to be there, he never wanted to be there.<br /><br />On the other hand Troy (Sarsgaard) struggles with learning his reenlistment has been denied at that he must soon leave.  Troy wants nothing more than to fight, but he fears he'll never get the opportunity to engage in the very thing he's trained so hard for.  Both Gyllenhaal and Sarsgaard put so much into their characters that the fact both were snubbed of Oscar nominations baffles me.  Especially Peter who quickly became the most sympathetic character in the bunch and the one we felt the most pain for.<br /><br />I've heard this is a very realistic view of what our soldiers go through, a lot of waiting around for something to happen with nothing to do but get close to those around you and pray the ones you left haven't moved on.  It's not your typical war film so don't expect `Saving Private Ryan' or anything like that.  This is a drama about the affect war has on those involved.  The cinematography is astounding, just beautifully shot, and Sam Mendes deserves top notch honors for his brilliant directing.  I'm just really shocked that this movie was overlooked by Oscar.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx does deliver a nice performance if albeit overshadowed by almost every other actor here, especially the aforementioned as well as Lucas Black who delivers the comedic relief in this film.  Gyllenhaal had a killer year with his Oscar nominated performance in `Brokeback Mountain' as well as `Proof' and with each performance he brought something new and something fresh to the fore.  He's definitely one to watch!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Dramatization of Mayan Decline"></head><body><p>Here you can see Gibson's vision of the Mayan kingdom as it faces its decline, the rulers insist the key to prosperity is to build more temples and offer human sacrifices. Jaguar Paw is a young man who is captured for sacrifice, but flees to avoid his fate. He is taken on a perilous journey to a world that is ruled by fear and oppression, where a harrowing end awaits him. Through a twist of fate and spurred by the power of his love for his woman and his family he will make a desperate break to return home and to ultimately save his way of life. Though the film has historical inaccuracies, it does show the behavior that caused its decline. This movie is fast paced, but be aware it has violent scenes.</p></body></html>

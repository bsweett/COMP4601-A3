The opening battle scene is probably the best of the series.<br />*Filming style is good.<br />*The storyline is good.  Includes a great deal of excitement, comedy, and drama.<br />*Incorporates a good deal of stuff from the Star Trek universe.  The Borg make for the best bad guys of the series.  They are quite menacing (and it's about time they stopped bringing up the Klingons!).  Also an original and refreshing look at the history of the saga, involving the guy who invented Warp Drive.<br />*Characters are good.  Picard shows a great deal of pain and compassion.<br />*Writing is good.<br />*Music is good.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Ummm...<br /><br />To start with, this film has some of the best action and battle scenes in the series.  It also boasts some immersive drama, comedy, and suspense.  And it ties in a lot of aspects from the TV shows to create a coherent plot.  It's probably the best film done by the Next Generation crew, and is certainly worthwhile watching.<br /><br />The one-disc version had good video and sound quality.  The two-disc version still has good quality, and has a number of featurettes and trailers.</p></body></html>

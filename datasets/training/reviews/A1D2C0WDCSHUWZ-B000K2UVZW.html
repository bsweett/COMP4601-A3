<meta name="summary" content="Bleary blurry Dahlia"></head><body><p>It had all the ingredients of a great movie -- sex, corruption, murder and a noir atmosphere.<br /><br />So how, how HOW did it go wrong? Instead of the real-life murder thriller of the year, "The Black Dahlia" ended up being a turgid, incomprehensible mess that flops madly around like an epileptic fish. "LA Confidential," this ain't -- it's more of a flaccid stagger into the real-life story of a gruesome murder, without much to make us care what happens.<br /><br />Dwight "Bucky" Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) and Leland "Lee" Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart) are boxer/cops, and are on a stakeout when the dismembered, disfigured body of a young woman is found -- blood drained, chopped in half, and mutilated all over. The public becomes increasingly obsessed with who killed the starlet, nicknamed the "Black Dahlia."<br /><br />So Bucky and Lee start investigating who killed the Black Dahlia, prowling through lesbian bars and learning the seedy details of what happened to the girl, with tragic results for the partners. Who killed the Black Dahlia, and why? The answers are even more shocking.<br /><br />And boring. "The Black Dahlia" is crammed with stuff to titillate and shock -- stag films, incest, lesbian pairings (for a pretty silly reason, actually), and Scarlett Johansson in 1940s lingerie. But it ends up doing the exact reverse -- it stupefies. Like a beautiful painting, it doesn't actually move or show anything really happening -- it just sits there, looking pretty.<br /><br />The first half is a pretty ordinary murder thriller, a la "L.A. Confidential" -- it's all very glitzy and grimy, and fairly easy to understand. Serial killer, pretty girl killed gruesomely, and two cops out to find out whodunnit. Right, that's fine. But when the guys start prowling through lesbian bars, the plot ties itself into a snarly knot, and gets more and more incomprehensible as Harnett rattles through the staggery storylines.<br /><br />Admittedly Brian De Palma juices this up with beautiful vintage costumes, sets and other stunning visuals. But by the ending, nothing makes sense -- and along the way, we have to deal with tepid subplots like the boxing (what?) and Bucky gallantly rejecting Lee's girlfriend's advances. It only complicates an incomprehensible plot, with turgid, forgettable dialogue (" I don't get modern art." "I doubt modern art gets you, either" -- what?).<br /><br />Harnett looks wooden and confused, as if he's just been told to "play it like Bogart" and he has no idea who that is. Eckhart tries his best, and he's an excellent actor even in a bad movie -- but Lee is a character with no logical thought processes, and Johansson basically is there to look busty and have sex with Harnett.<br /><br />Lame neo-noir with a twist of tepidity, "The Black Dahlia" takes what could have been a promising movie, and turns it into a Gordian knot of absurd subplots and horrible twists.</p></body></html>

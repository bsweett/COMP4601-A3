MOVIE!"></head><body><p>CHARACTERS ARE SO THIN AND USELESS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE NAMES BUT NUMBERS INSTEAD!THEY ALSO DIE IN REVERSE ORDER ON THE SCREEN. THE BIG PROBLEM WITH THIS MOVIE IS THAT IT'S SET IN AGE WHERE T.V. AND THE INTERNET BROADCAST EVERYTHING SO HOW IS IT THAT AS PER "ALIENS" WE'VE NEVER ENCOUNTERED A SPECIES AS YOU ARE DESCRIBING RIPLEY!!! THEY MADE THIS FOR SHOCK VALUE MORE THAN ANYTHING BECAUSE IT IS STUPID! I GAVE IT A 2 FOR ACTION AND EFFECTS.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Welcome to Crystal Lake!"></head><body><p>The Crystal Lake Camp is about to be re-opened years after a double murder took place at the camp site.  The local residents believe the camp ground is haunted and possessed by a lethal curse, and they therefore avoid it at all costs.  Despite the local folklore, some young camp leaders decide to take a job there and help get the camp ready for the opening that is scheduled within two weeks.  This is a dire decision, since the local legend has some validity and the curse is about to take its course.  The audience is left with a rather gory and scary film, which creates a feeling of paranoia along with the feeling of being watched.</p></body></html>

The movie starts in the latter period of World War 2.  The Nazi's feel that they are going to los the war, and are desperately looking for an edge or a weapon to turn the tides.  So an enigmatic figure creates a gate to the resting place of a very HP Lovecraft inspired creature, alien, powerful, and destrucive.  But a Professor Bloom and a a group of American soldiers were there as part of a new paranormal government agency.  They manage to stop this but find a humanoid creature with devil like features, but a complete child.  The professor takes him in and nurtures him to become a hero and an member of his agency.<br /><br />The movie skips forward to modern day times.  Hellboy is an adolescent, but bigger than the average body builder.  He eats insane quantities of food and has a strange affinity for cats, and they cover his room.  Rumors of hellboys existence are all over the papers, but regarded as rumor and local legend by many.  Along with an aquatic pyschic, a woman who can start flames, and more mundane government agents(men in black).<br /><br />The plot is based off the ressurection of the one that opened the portal he came through.  He is paired with the woman he peformed the ritual with, and a strange man who is mostly artificial, a lot of his body parts and movements are a complex set of gears, like a clock.<br /><br />This movie was very well made.  I have to agree with a lot of its critics, the character development was a bit slow, but it was worth the wait.  The acting was top notch, the villians menacing and mysterious, well cast, the good guys quirky and 3 dimensional, and Ron Pearlman shines as Hellboy, a creature trying to pass for human.<br /><br />Hellboy himself is an intersting character.  He goes to the length of filing his horns down to look more human, there is a funny scene of him working on them with a sander, and he doesn't like them looked at.  He has a strange sense of humor from being locked up and having to be kept a secret.  Though he is huge, he is still mentally and emotionally an adolescent, often breaking out of the confines to see his crush.  He likes cats so much that he defends a basket of kittens while fighting an evil monster.  Ron Pearlman doesn't play Hellboy, he is hellboy.<br /><br />The plot is interesting and well paced.  The action sequences were fun and kept things interesting.  The plot exposition is informative without being too wordy.<br /><br />Despite its flaws this is a very enjoyable film.  Appealing to those interested in HP Lovecraft like horror, comic books, science fiction, the occult, and action movies.  I look forward to the sequel, and the cast of strange villians and heroes they will introduce.</p></body></html>

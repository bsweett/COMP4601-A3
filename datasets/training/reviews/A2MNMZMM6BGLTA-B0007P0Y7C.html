<meta name="summary" content="Totally Miscast"></head><body><p>I didn't think this movie was horrible but the one thing that stands out for somebody who read the graphic novel Elektra Lives, and Elktra Assassin and followed the character in the comic books is the total miscasting of Jennifer Garner as Elektra. The girl is physically fit and has the body and the moves but she is just a poor actress and does not fit the part of the Greek assassin. That said, Terrance Stamp is good as Stick her mentor but they do not portray him anything like the character in the comics. The character of Stick was a foul mouthed mentor who would as soon cuss Elektra or anybody out as look at them. They add Typhoid Mary, a really cool character and played by a beautiful actress, that wasn't even in the Elektra comics but in Daredevil. They also don't portray the character as she was written, a homocidal schizophrenic who is a mousey Mary and then turns into a crazy serial killer Typhoid who hates men. Stone, is portrayed as an indestructable hulk of a man but again they go against the comic by making him part of The Hand, the evil Ninja clan, when in the comic he was with Stick and The Chaste. Garner is just not right for the part. She doesn't have the look and the costume is weak.<br /><br />All that said, if you didn't read the comic you probably will at least find it an entertaining action flick on some level. Its worth seeing just a complete let down to this Elektra fan.</p></body></html>

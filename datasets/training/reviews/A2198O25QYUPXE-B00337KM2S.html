<meta name="summary" content="Fitting given the recent global financial crisis"></head><body><p>"Up in the Air" is a comedy-drama film that follows the work of Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) who informs workers all over America that they are laid off.<br /><br />Bingham does the dirty work for restructuring businesses as an employee of an independent company Career Transitions Corporation (CTC). His life of travel and shallow living hits a snag though when he is teamed up with fresh faced Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) who is looking at ways to reduce travel costs for CTC, but life on the road is where Bingham feels in his element.<br /><br />For years Bingham has used smooth talk and insincere advice to comfort those that he has fired, yet spending time with Keener, developing a relationship with a fellow work travel junky he comes across, and the marriage of his younger sister combine to undo his world of ostentation.<br /><br />The film narrative covers many themes such as selfishness, workplace cold heartedness, and reflecting on social attitudes that for a long time provided Bingham with comfort but are exposed to be flawed life compasses.<br /><br />It is a movie that viewers will be able to relate to in their own ways with an assorted storyline that is at times saddening, often humorous, and philosophically informative.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W.

<meta name="summary" content="A visually stunning (albeit historically inaccurate) film..."></head><body><p>This new telling of the gruesome Jack the Ripper murders that struck London in 1888 may not be the most historically accurate telling of the story, but it is the most surreal and creepy telling of it in modern cinema history.  A lot of that goes to the talented group behind this film.  Johnny Depp stars as Inspector Abberline, a London detective whose Opium and Absinthe fueled dreams give him clues to the identity of the brutal killer of prostitutes in the slums of Whitechapel.  But as starts to discover, there are secrets that link these murders together and a conspiracy that goes to the highest levels of power in England.  The performances are solid, including Ian Holm as the Queen's chief surgeon (who has a few secrets of his own), Robbie Coltrane as the Inspector's reluctant partner, and Heather Graham as a prostitute who starts a dangerous relationship with Abberline.  The film was directed by the Hughes Brothers, Albert and Allen (who directed more 20th century oriented fare such as "Menace II Society" and "Dead Presidents") and based upon the complex and grpahic comic book by Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell.  Thanks to cinematographer Peter Deming (Mulholland Drive, Lost Highway) and the stunning production design, this movie makes 19th century London seem as dark and as creepy as the comic does.  While the film doesn't adhear too closely to the book, the graphic detail of the murders and the rather unusual conspiracy angle make this movie a must-see for horror buffs.  The DVD (a two-disc set to be replaced by a single disc by the end of the year) is definitely a must-own for fans of the film.  The lively commentary track feature the Hughes Brothers, Deming, Coltrane, and screenwriter Rafael Yglesias explaining not only the details of the film, but of the actual murders, theories, and some complaints about the studio system that make this an interesting listen.  One the first disc are nearly 20 deleted scenes and an alternate ending that is worth seeing with the optional commentary, if only to hear about an unusual extended shot that is worth questioning.  On disc two are some intersting documentaries on the production design, a humorous trip through the set with the Hughes Brothers, a look at the history of Absinthe, a look into the theories of Jack the Ripper's identity (everyone from the Queen's doctor to Lewis Carroll, writer of "Alice in Wonderland" are perceived to be suspects), and a look at the book as opposed to the film.  Rounding it off is the very short "making of" special aired on HBO, trailers, and look for a very special Easter Egg in the main menu.  All in all, this is definitely a most sinful treat and for those of you "From Hell" fans, this two-disc set is definitely worth the extra buck.</p></body></html>

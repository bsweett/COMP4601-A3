<meta name="summary" content="A HARD FILM TO JUDGE"></head><body><p>Oscar smiled on Charlize Theron.  And boy did she deserve it.  Her performance (aside from the much ballyhooed physical transformation) is the stuff legends are made of.  There isn't a moment that Theron isn't Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute who murdered at least seven of her johns.  Charlize takes each movement, each emotion, each glance and makes Aileen a character you DO feel sorry for.<br />And for me, that's the problem with MONSTER.  Aileen certainly had a difficult upbringing, a youth full of abuse, of not being pretty, of not being loved.  But, ultimately, does that justify the lives she took?  Granted, her first kill could be considered as self-defense. But later she planned her murders, she solicited these johns knowing she would murder them, and doing it just so she could keep her little kewpie doll lover, Selby.  Director/writer Patty Jensen obviously stacked the deck in favor of Aileen, trying to manipulate her audience into accepting Aileen as the victim of her background, of men who used women, etc.  But what about the last victim she killed?  He wasn't even interested in her for sex, but she killed him anyway.  This is a heartless, self-centered, and certainly disturbed woman who demonstrated little remorse in the end.  MONSTER is a manipulative film, and one that tries to make light of Aileen's crimes.  It also portrays her lover as a selfish, self-centered young girl who couldn't face up to the fact that not only did she know what Aileen was doing, but encouraged her to continue doing it, just so she could get her house by the beach.  Serial killers are not role models, and although one can sympathize to a point, this movie whitewashes the facts with its unabashed bias for Aileen.<br />But, as a movie, one can't fault the performances.  Not only is Theron brilliant, but Christina Ricci does a fine job as Selby, even though her character ends up being as despicable as Aileen.<br />And while we're at it, why should we feel sorry for Aileen when she goes for a job interview at a law office without a resume?  Is this really true to life?  You don't get interviews for legal secretaries without a resume, and just because Aileen WANTED the job, why should she get it when she's not qualified?  This manipulation of facts by director Jensen is typical of the stacked deck of a movie.<br />Worth seeing for Charlize Theron's undeniably jawdropping performance, but don't make the mistake of buying the awkward sentimentality it is trying to gag you with.</p></body></html>

He gets caught up in the escalation of ethnic tensions between the Hutus and Tutsis that eventually led to the slaughter of some 800,000 Tutsuis and moderate Hutus.  The Tutsis were given favored status by the colonizing Belgians but the hatred intensified once independence was granted in 1962.<br /><br />Cheadle, a moderate Hutu, had curried favor with many influential people in his position in the hotel.  When violence broke out he was able to shelter more than 1200 refugees in his hotel protecting them from the wanton extermination of the Tutsis by the radical Hutus.  Cheadle and wife Tatiana played by Sophie Okonedo and family were afforded some protection within the confines of the hotel by U.N. forces Colonel Oliver played by Nick Nolte.  He also bought protection with bribes to Rwandan General Bizimungu played by Fana Mokoena.<br /><br />Cheadle had to use all of his influence and wits to protect those he harbored in his hotel when Western powers and the U.N. invoked a policy of non-intervention.  This decision potentiated the slaughter of the innocents and will always remain as a scar on the disposition of mankind.<br /><br />George's realistic portrayal of this horrendous chapter in human history was an eye opening experience of an incident that didn't get the worldwide media coverage it deserved.  This movie represented an important addition to our social consciousness and was wonderfully executed.</p></body></html>

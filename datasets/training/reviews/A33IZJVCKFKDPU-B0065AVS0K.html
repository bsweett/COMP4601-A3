<meta name="summary" content="It Would Be a 'Sin' To Miss This One"></head><body><p>As you have probably heard, Sin City is based off of Frank Miller's "Graphic" novels, and yes, graphic is a very good word to describe this movie.  The movie takes place in a fictional city, maybe nieghboring Gotham City or Metropolis.  However this city does not have any real heros, per se, there are a few good-doers, but they are also crooks (with the exception of Bruce Willis' character, John Hartigan).  This city has been overrun by corruption and director Robert Rodriguez does a great job of creating a digital atmosphere of the City.<br /><br />For the most part, this movie plays out like a Quentin Tarentino film.  The movie consists of three stories, which are not in chronological order, that eventually intertwine with eachother.  The first of those stories is about aging cop John Hartigan trying to save young Nancy Callahan from a serial rapist.  Hartigan gets betrayed by his partner (Michael Madsen) and is set-up for the kidnapping and an alleged rape.  This story concludes at the end of the movie.<br /><br />The second story revolves around Marv (Mickey Rourke).  Marv is a big, ugly guy that has a beautiful girl come into his life one day and he can't figure out why.  Well, she is murdered and Marv is set-up for the crime.  This eventually spirals into Marv going on a hunt for the person who killed his "angel".  The hunt leads him to the home of a Senator and the most powerful priest in town.  With the help of some of the town's female escorts, Marv eventually gets face to face with the killer of his "angel" for a showdown.<br /><br />The female escorts also help out Dwight (Clive Owen) in the thrid story.  Dwight becomes involved with a waitress (Brittany Murphy) and has to deal with her one-time companion Jack (Benicio Del Toro), who is the type of guy that always has a posse follow him around for protection purposes.  Now a chase that leads into the Escort's side of town endangers a truce that was made with the Mob and the police.  Its Dwight's job to try to prevent this truce from ending and to prevent a sort of "mob war".<br /><br />All of the actors do a pretty good job with the roles they are given and seem to be comfortable playing those characters.  Marv is the character with the most depth of any of the many characters.  As mentioned earlier, Rodriguez has done a great job with this movie.  The city and the atmosphere of the movie are great.  Also the colorization of the film is also something that has never been done before.  Some characters or particular item have color, while the majority of the film is in a black comic book looking color.  The visuals of this film are the most impressive aspect.<br /><br />My suggestion would be to see this film.  It is one of the most original films that I have seen in a while.  Also, the film may have changed the comic book genre forever.  If you have a weak heart, this may be too violent.  Otherwise, if you enjoy action movies with a good storyline and great visuals, then you should definately check out this movie.</p></body></html>

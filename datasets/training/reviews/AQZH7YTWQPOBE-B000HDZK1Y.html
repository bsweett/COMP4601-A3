<meta name="summary" content="Muchos silly"></head><body><p>A movie starring Jack Black in tights - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HRMAPO">Nacho Libre</a> had the potential to be a bomb or hilarious. Fortunately, it veers closer to the latter. Black, a monk at a Mexican monastery, has a secret obsession with wrestling. He sneaks out to wrestle, but constantly loses. As the cover suggests, the film's comedy is pretty outrageous and odd, such when Black gets defeated by the midget "Satan's Cavemen" tag-team. It's hard to say why exactly the movie is funny, but it's probably just a mix of Jack Black's energy and zaniness, combined with clownish costumes and bizarre settings. Fortunately, unlike most comedies nowadays, it never stoops into the gutter - all of the humor is appropriate for kids.</p></body></html>

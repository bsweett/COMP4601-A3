Despite being a low budget production, the scenery shots are quite stunning. But as for people calling it gory, it wasn't that gory. Perhaps that's because I just saw Hostel before watching Wolf Creek or perhaps it takes a whole lot more gross-out to officially freak me out. Regardless, Wolf Creek is enjoyable and I should warn you to be prepared to wait a little bit for the set-up. But once it gets going, it is pretty creepy. 2 girls and a guy are making their way across Australia when they stop at a place called Wolf Creek. But when they go to leave, of course the car won't start. Enter a man from the Outback who  seems as friendly and charming as Crocodile Dundee. He offers to help them out and gives them a tow, but of course in grand scary movie tradition, this "bloke" is more than just a smidge unbalanced. One of the best things I can say for Wolf Creek is that I thought a certain outcome was evident (and to tell you would ruin it) but I was caught off guard. The atmosphere is creepy and certainly gives you that freaked out feeling you hope to attain from movies in this genre. Not bad at all, and although not the best out there, it's very enjoyable and a change of pace from the American fare. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bucket List on Blu Ray"></head><body><p>Well, it is easy to see that some love this film while others dismiss it as an overly sentimental mishmash so I won't bother to go into the story lines and plot development.  Personally, I like this movie, a lot.  Aside from some typical over the top acting from our boy Jack and Morgan Freeman's typical wise old guy persona, the movie works for me, and as others have stated, delivered a new phrase in our lexicon.<br /><br />However, if you are expecting a greatly increased quality from the blu ray version...don't.  The audio is strictly a 5.1 lossy offering and not DTSHD.  For a dialogue driven film like this, it really doesn't make much of a difference.  There is very little use of the surrounds for your home theater system to make use of.  The video quality is good, nothing outstanding but good.<br /><br />There are a number of extras but no deleted scenes or alternates.  The interview between Rob Reiner, the director and Morgan Freeman was done over a television hookup so that when the camera focuses on Morgan, the interlacing is very, very apparent and I found it distracting.  The whole interview, while some interesting things were mentioned seemed as if the two of them were doing nothing but saying how wonderful they both were.  It got boring.<br /><br />For me, the movie is a 5 star treat, nothing heavy but the end does make me well up.  I do wish the audio were mixed better which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of help and, if so, please check the 'Helpful' button so I know I am on the correct path with my reviews for you.

<meta name="summary" content="Still fascinating despite some Spielbergian excesses"></head><body><p>This is a real "guilty pleasure" with me, a fun film to watch that, at the same time, is silly to the point of almost nonsense in many ways. While it was a high water mark in Spielberg's career, it also marked the beginning of some of the indulgences that make him a second-rate filmmaker today. (Save me your flame mail, I won't retract that.)<br /><br />There are some moments in Close Encounters that look good on film, but are seriously illogical or just plain silly: building a giant Devil's Tower in your living room when it'd be much more convenient to do it in your backyard; implanting a mountain image in the brains of casual UFO witnesses while sending longitudes and latitudes to the scientists; hauling a giant globe into a cramped radio telescope booth when it could be dealt with more easily where it was already standing; going all the way to India and asking *one* question, and a pretty stupid one at that; organizing a "top secret" operation by meeting in an ENORMOUS hall when there are all of about 50 people involved; allowing a woman to leave the state and otherwise go about her life without police surveillance when she claims her son has disappeared because aliens "stole" him; camouflaging trucks full of scientific gear with mock food signs, when they would be perfectly unobtrusive as simply unmarked trucks carrying perfectly legitimate research gear; chartering a bus (!!!) to take the red-suited astronauts to Wyoming when an unmarked military transport helicopter would have been a far better way to keep the mission secret; teaching a group of men and women hand-signals that aliens may not understand, or, worse, may misconstrue. Not to mention the silliest scene I've ever seen in a movie that is not a comedy: in the Gobi desert, jeeps are *followed* by *low-flying helicopters.* These helicopters should be scouting ahead, but they just fly near the ground and kick up sand. And someone has to tell Spielberg the locals there use horses for transportation, not camels.<br /><br />But there are many grand scenes too--one just wishes Spielberg could put a brake on the sillier parts of his imagination: the magnificent moment where Roy and Jillian first see, and rush up to, the mountain. The genuine awe and sweetness of the ending, totally devoid of any cynicism or negativity, yet not sappy either. The soulful, understated performance by Melinda Dillon. The incredible, spontaneous scenes with the little boy. (My favorite moment in this whole film is when she is on the rock madly snapping pictures of the Mothership and he is next to her, just silently staring at the amazing ship from which he had just come.) The way the aliens are more hinted at than shown. (There's one wonderful longshot of them just standing there looking at us, and then we look back at them. What more is there to say?) The effects were visionary in their time and have held up extremely well since 1977. Were it not for the cars and the haircuts and the suburban furnishings, you'd think this movie were made today. And Spielberg does such a good job of taking two worlds--two movies, really--and crashing them together head-on and making it work. You have the middle-class ordinary family existence, told conventionally, even blandly, and you have the grand, supernatural world of the UFOs. Spielberg joins them seamlessly, makes one believable in the realm of the other. Not many sci-fi movies have attempted this; they generally are very "futuristic" and "spacy" to begin with. Spielberg's triumph is that he melded his aliens into routine Indiana suburbia, brought them down to the Dairy Queen, and we don't laugh at the incongruity. It's credible. It's more of a directing job than Spielberg is often given credit for.<br /><br />Fortunately, most of the scenes cut from the 1980 reissue are restored here. While often underwrittten (the whole film is underwritten), they give the film the weight in the real world it needs to be truly credible. Spielberg was unwise to scissor them at all.<br /><br />The DVD picture is quite good overall.  The sound is very fine and a lot of additional surround material has been added (more bass, more stereophonic wind effects and chatter in the air traffic control scene) that is not overdone and gives the film more presence without being obtrusive. The second disc of the documentary, deleted scenes and other goodies is fascinating. You'll learn everything you ever wanted to know about the making of CE3K in the 100+ minute supplement, and you can see a lot of early expositional material that was eventually cut from the movie (most of it wisely so, though there's a great scene with a young Carl Weathers that I wish they'd have kept).  The only thing that mars the documentary is Spielberg's silly PC comment that he created three different types of aliens because he wanted to show cosmic diversity and multiculturalism.  If you read Bob Balaban's book about the making of the film, written before there was such a thing as PC, you'd know the aliens aren't consistent-looking (neither are some of the saucer shots) because he was trying different techniques as he went along, hoping something would work.  Or, if he's so concerned with diversity, why are almost all the scientist-earthlings white males?<br /><br />The trailers are interesting primarily for illustrating how poorly trailers were made back then.<br /><br />Overall a great release of a young, fearless Spielberg, only about 30 when he made this ambitious film.  Too bad he never (at least in my opinion) fulfilled his promise to become the wunderkind director everyone was already calling him. After his disastrous next film, 1941, he started playing it safe, and never again attempted something like CE3K. For the next 20 years he was content to make formulaic flicks notable mostly for their special effects--and yes, I'm including ET on that list.  Sure he's tackled some serious subjects, but even then his approach is generally simplistic, as though he's giving us a Dumbed Down Everyman's Guide to our recent past history.  Steven Spielberg (and George Lucas) very likely started the present trend of filmmakers not trusting their audience's intelligence very much.  Pity.</p></body></html>

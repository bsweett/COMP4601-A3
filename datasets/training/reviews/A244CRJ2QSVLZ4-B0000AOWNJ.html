<meta name="summary" content="A Modern Gothic Masterpiece"></head><body><p>"The Ring" is a modern gothic masterpiece that is genuinely horrifying and creepy.  Like the shower scene is "Psycho," "The Ring" contains one of the most bizarre scenes in cinematic history that will never be forgotten:  When the dripping wet ghost of Samara climbs out of the television.  The atmosphere throughout the movie is dark, dank and depressing.  Leaves are changing, cold wind is blowing, and rain is pelting.<br /><br />  Naomi Watts is great as the beautiful, young journalist who is investigating the strange VHS tape that has killed her niece and everyone else who has watched it.  She scrambles to uncover its secrets before her and her son become the next victims.<br /><br />  "The Ring" is a good, clean scare that will continue to chill you long after the television is turned off.  I would love to see a director`s cut of this movie.<br /><br />  "Before you die, you see the ring."  What a great tagline!</p></body></html>

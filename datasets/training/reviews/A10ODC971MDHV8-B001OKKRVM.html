<meta name="summary" content="March of the Penguins"></head><body><p>Not only is "Penguins" visually arresting (as you'd expect from a National Geographic production), it is emotionally involving, transcending its genre to become a family-friendly crowd-pleaser with nary an explosion or special effect in sight. Ubiquitous as his strong, comforting voice is, Morgan Freeman still makes the ideal narrator to convey this unexpectedly moving tale. Recommended as superb family viewing.</p></body></html>

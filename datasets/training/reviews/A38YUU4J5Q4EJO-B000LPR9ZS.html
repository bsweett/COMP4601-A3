The plot is better, and there is more of everything than in 1 or 2.<br /><br />More blood, more traps, more characters and storylines..just more of everything.<br /><br />Also there seem to be a lot more twists and turns in this one.<br /><br />Another thing I liked about it , is that it picked up right where Saw 2 left off, as Amanda in closing the door on the cop.<br /><br />This movie is so good, and so full of surprises, that I can't say anymore or it will spoil it. I will only say that Jigsaw is still alive in this movie, not dead dead like I thought from Saw 2.<br /><br />This would be very hard to top if they decide to make a Saw 4 !</p></body></html>

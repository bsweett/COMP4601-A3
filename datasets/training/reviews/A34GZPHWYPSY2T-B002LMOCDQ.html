<meta name="summary" content="Are critics, pro and amateur, brain dead?"></head><body><p>ALL of this film is perhaps a tad "Bollywood", as my wife pointed out--but we both ADORED this film. If one is not an ABBA fan, then forget it. If one is a Colin Firth fan, it has only minutes of Colin at his funniest and most brilliant. ALL the actors sing well.<br /><br />If I may say so, the potshots taken at Pierce Brosnan for his singing are nasty and stupid. There is a very famous songwriter who insists on singing his own music, and his voice is far worse than Pierce's. And as I see in another review, Pierce STUDIED just to be able to sing. I do agree it was a bad decision to give him "SOS". He doesn't have the range for it.<br /><br />The cinematography is what one expects from a musical, come on! Did you expect Hitchcockian or Spielbergian work here? It's supposed to be fun. Perhaps the critics of this film are not old enough to know what's good and right. This film is definitely good and right. The storyline is NOT a pathetic contrivance-- SHAME ON YOU AMAZON-- because if one watches it, it touches, it works. That canned corn is from the old critiques of the Broadway version. No one could have staged this; as a film, it's magic. It was lovely purely to watch the actors clearly having the times of their lives!<br /><br />As a rule, I dislike musicals with all my might. I watched this film because of what it is, who's in it, and the music. I was never at any moment disappointed. Having just endured a death in the family, this movie was almost a salvation. I laughed, sang along, and rollicked until it was almost a desecration.<br /><br />It's been since 2000 since I saw a movie that made me act like that.<br /><br />And by the way, if you watch carefully, Sophie DOES learn who her actual father is--but don't expect the film itself to reveal it.<br /><br />One final thing about this plain DVD version: there are no extras to speak of; a deleted scene that is delightful but gives too much away, that's all. No documentary or interviews. With this kind of fun film, who needs it??</p></body></html>

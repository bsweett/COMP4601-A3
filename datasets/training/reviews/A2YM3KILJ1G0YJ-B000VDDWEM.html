<meta name="summary" content="Great horror sequel - same gripping style"></head><body><p>28 Weeks Later provides a worthy sequel to the original 28 Days Later, and maintains the same frenetic pace, music style, filming look, and edge-of-your-seat thrills that were provided by the original. It doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />The filme begins with a great scene which is assumed to have happened at the same time as the original movie. We find Don, Alice, and several others attempting to squeak by in life, scrounging on what they can, hiding in a dank, dark basement of an inner-city cottage of sorts. The windows and doors are boarded up; no light gets in. They don't want those infected by the Rage virus to realize that "normal" people are inside.<br /><br />Unfortunately, however, they are discovered, and their quiet, safe cottage soon becomes a source of carnage and chaos. Don is forced into self-preservation mode when an infected person is placed between him and his wife. What makes the decision especially difficult is that Don is right next to an escape route. An exciting start gets even more interesting when Don decides to abandon his wife and make a break for it.<br /><br />As he makes his way out of the cottage, he looks back to find his wife screaming for him, and looking at him through a window. The anguish is written all over his face as his wife is taken down by the infected, but he continues to make his escape, running as fast as he can. Naturally, he begins to get chanced by the infected, and a great fear of someone being chased is realized: open fields with no escape route are not the preferred location.<br /><br />After Don's escape, where he has to yet again make a decision to leave someone behind and display the truism in today's cynicism, the movie ties up the loose ends of the original. The British Isles, just as Jim and that soldier who was chained up along with him suspected, have been quarantined, and the Rage-infected people are left to die of starvation. Well, 28 weeks later, the world decides that the outbreak has contained itself, and the time has come to rebuild society on the British Isles.<br /><br />The cleanup effort contains all you would expect: a large military presence, burning of bodies, reconstruction, creation of order, and repopulation. The U.S. Army and its NATO allies hold strict control over the logistics and the mission. It's still not safe, and only an isolated area of the island where the majority of the cleanup has occurred will be inhabited. Most of the repopulation is comprised of those who were off the island at the time of the original outbreak, or at least those who made it off.<br /><br />Don is placed in this location as a manager of a building of sorts, and his children are part of the repopulation process. We're shown the happy reunion and we find out that the children were in Spain when the Rage outbreak began. It's only a matter of time before his children, Tammy and Andy, ask about their mother, and Don, naturally, lies to them, telling them he tried to help her but the Rage-infected people got her. He sells it really well, though, and they believe him.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Don, the movie had to progress, and the Rage had to reappear; otherwise, there wouldn't be a movie. So, naturally, Don's children escape the quarantined zone to travel back home. There are some items they want to get, specifically a picture of their mother, so that she is never forgotten. It turns out that their mother isn't dead, and Don, as well as involved scientists, have some 'splaining to do!<br /><br />It turns out that the mother has the Rage virus, but is somehow immune. This tidbit of information should have been passed to Don, because he clearly wants to make amends, explain himself, and be "close" to his wife. And, thus, the outbreak begins anew.<br /><br />From there, disorder and confusion ensue, with the military unsure how to handle the rapid spread of the virus, especially when fueled by a frantic, scared, panic-stricken population. The military is forced to go into a "Code Red" situation, and that is almost always a bad thing for the bad guys. "Code Red" in this movie means using a sledge-hammer to kill a fly, and the military does a pretty good job of killing the fly. It's just too bad that it's not 100% effective.<br /><br />As a result of the slight military inadequacies, we find a cast of survivors, which include the children and their doctor, as well as one of the Army snipers, running to the safety of a helicopter extrication at Wembley Stadium.<br /><br />The film ends on a somber, downtrodden nature, as we see the helicopter, which has presumably crashed, in Paris, France, and the Rage virus has spread off the British Isles.<br /><br />It's a worthy sequel, with much of what made the original such a cult classic. The only real negative that I can mention is that there are parts of the movie, in the director's effort to convey the incredibly frenetic post-outbreak chaos, that have very shaky, unstable, even distracting filmwork. It's as if the filming was done during an earthquake and there is absolutely no stability. Otherwise, the style, theme, sound, feel, and if possible, even the smell makes the viewer think of the original, and in that effort to be true to the original, this film is a resounding success.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Original The Greatest Re-Make The Worst"></head><body><p>I will always remember the fog original as one of the best John Carpenter's movies this re-make is so sadly horrible it's a wonder it was ever made.  This re-make was obviously made for the young adults for today who are more<br />into these unremarkable actors and actresses of today.  Tom Welling may be good as Clark Kent on Smallville but his acting here was while not atrocious<br />was not even in the good range and the blond girlfriend of his in the movie<br />who's name I cant recall was just if not even more terrible.  There are some decent actors in the movie but are far in few so all I can say is get the original movie and keep this atrocious re-make where it belongs on the shelves or in the trash..</p></body></html>

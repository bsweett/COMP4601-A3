You'll probably immediately recall her fake, pained facial expressions from scenes of maudlin excess in the Star Wars prequels (which, of course, were god-awful films, but don't get me started).  And because she appears in so many scenes, and her acting is at best hit or miss, it does take V for Vendetta down a notch.  Which doesn't mean you shouldn't see it, of course.  It's been a long time since we've had such a thoughtful, beautiful, and engaging movie like this, and even more surprising that it would come from the guys who most recently brought us (yawn) the two boring and pseudo-intellectual sequels to the Matrix.  Yep, the Warchowski brothers have written a highly literate, powerful movie that you really should see.<br /><br />Aside from Portman (who does a stretch in a dungeon and comes out looking like a concentration camp survivor -- except that she was just as emaciated before she went in ... does she eat in real life?), the acting is really first rate.  Stephen Fry is sensational as a talk show host with a secret life, Hugo Weaving gives a powerful performance from beneath a rigid mask, John Hurt is great as a power-mad 1984-style dictator, Steven Rea is wonderful as a detective with a heart, and Tim Pigott-Smith plays the stern face of evil with aplomb.<br /><br />All this aside, I can't help but believe that many people, blinded by modern propaganda, will mistake the world in V for Vengeance as a thinly veiled stab at the modern United States or the Bush administration.  It obviously isn't.  In fact, only an intellectual adolescent would mistake real totalitarianism for what's going on in the United States, but that discussion is for another place and time.  Moreover, the film also, by dwelling on homosexuality as much as it does (some attention to this is warranted given that sexual freedom is often controlled in totalitarian states, but it almost predominates), dilutes attention from the real victim of oppression:  expression in all of its forms, not just sexual.  Sadly, I think in today's world, however, freedom is more often associated with what a person does with their sexual organs than with the quality of their ideas.  Love is important, and sex is important too, but free thought and realm of ideas are what make us special ... and what we must die to protect if need be.<br /><br />All this, plus a satisfying ending.  Since when have we gotten that?</p></body></html>

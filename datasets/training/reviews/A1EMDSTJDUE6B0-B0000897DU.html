<meta name="summary" content="Decent Movie"></head><body><p>I was tempted to give this four stars because it did not jump out at me and shake me. However, the acting is good (Eminem is surprisingly good), the plot is simple but somewhat novel, the editing is very good, the soundtrack is very good and the extras are very good (you have to check out the amateur rap fights).<p>Yes, I like Eminem and think he is one of the most creative artists of the 90s. I also like classical music and classic rock. Although he does use a lot of expletives, this is a case where the expletives are not a mask for inferior work -- his stuff is good. The movie does not have him swearing nearly as much as his music does. However, there are several sexual situations that should stay out of the reach of youngsters.<p>The ending leaves us with hope and comes as a real positive outcome -- not sure how a "dark" message could be taken from that. It seems much more mature than many "serious" films being done these days.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Ring  (2002)"></head><body><p>Director:  Gore Verbinski<br /><br />Cast:  Naomi Watts, Martin Henderson, David Dorfman, Brian Cox, Jane Alexander, Lindsay Frost, Amber Tamblyn.<br /><br />Running Time:  115 minutes.<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for intense situations, violence, and some language.<br /><br />Adapted from the 1998 Japanese classic "Ringu", screenwriter Ehren Kruger continues his success after films such as "Arlington Road" and the "Scream" series with this incredibly edgy, taught thriller.  Director Gore Verbinksi (no pun intended) is a hidden gem with this film before his supreme success with "The Pirates of the Caribbean" series.  Naomi Watts stars in a breakthrough role as a single parent/news reporter who learns of the mysterious death of a family member.  Personally charged to get answers concerning the grisly aftermath and occupationally energized to bring her findings onto the television screen, Rachel Keller (Watts) dives deeper and deeper into secrets of a video tape that is causing all of this horror.  When her investigation brings her small son (the creepy youngster Dorfman) and her ex-lover (Henderson) into the mix, Rachel must solve the mystery and save her loved ones before it's too late.<br /><br />An excellent, intelligent screenplay by Kruger is projected onto the big screen in a deliciously scary manner.  The film is not overly violent (although you would believe otherwise due to the director's name), but uses atmosphere and tension to create its scares, rather than campy blood and guts.  Watts is very strong in the starring role, showing some cinematic range and displaying a set of lungs that may end up rivaling none other than Jamie Lee Curtis.  While the twentieth century has brought on a barrage of disrespected, simple-minded, and ridiculous horror films, "The Ring" shines above the rest as a solid adventure into a new scope of the genre and succeeds mightily due to its superb direction and cinematography.  Lots of jolts and jumps, as well as one hell of a creepy videotape.  One of the best horror films of the decade thus far.  The DVD version possesses a supremely spine-chilling version of the videotape that is portrayed in the film.</p></body></html>

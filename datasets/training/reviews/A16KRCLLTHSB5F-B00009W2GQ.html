<meta name="summary" content="Mixed bag"></head><body><p>This movie has its strengths and weaknesses. My opinion of it has declined since I saw it, and I do think it's the weakest of the trilogy, but it's definitley still worth seeing.<p>Pros - Some really excellent scenes, from the murky fight in the club to the more intense battle inside the craft between Neo and Smith, and of course the final battle, which may be a bit overwrought but is still visually impressive. Also I don't think Reeves' performance is as bad as some people say; it wouldn't make sense for him to express emotion strongly when the plot of the series has gradually been turning him into a superhuman, detached, Christ-like figure; I think a lot of his blankness may be intentional.<p>Cons - There is a lot of bad acting, admittedly, and a lot of moments which are embarassing in their sentimentality or simply their lack of sense. The movie's worst flaw, though, is its inabilty to give the series a satisfying conclusion; a message, or a definite feeling, just basically a reason for its existence. You really feel like the second two movies were pointless; competent, maybe, but pointless.<p>In the end, three stars seems fair. People almost certainly expected too much, and now they take delight in savaging this movie, but I think it's a fairly solid three stars.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A solid, if not overwhelming, action film."></head><body><p>A post-apocalyptic action film with Denzel Washington as the hero and Gary Oldman as the villain, with Mila Kunis along for the requisite femme fatale role, and Tom Waits thrown in for good measure?  THE BOOK OF ELI had all the requirements to be a first-rate film, a stand-out in the genre.  Unfortunately, it isn't.  True, it has an interesting premise: a man (Eli) is traveling across the country, carrying the last remaining Bible (not really a spoiler; you kind of know it long before it's "revealed").  Simultaneously, an evil man named Carnegie (groan) is devouring all the books he gets, looking for that one...that holy one.  And when he meets Eli, and finds his book, he wants it.  Oh, he wants it.  The only thing he didn't plan on, though, is how much a** Eli can kick.<br /><br />I will give the film this much: it never quite drops the bottom out on you.  And the action is stylized; it's nice to see Denzel kicking butt and taking names.  And Oldman shines in an otherwise cliched role.  Mila Kunis should probably stick to comedy (remember MAX PAYNE?  Me neither), and it's kind of unsettling, having her be the sole attractive woman in the world.  The film has its flaws, far too many of them--most of it hinges on the script, which is just pathetic at times.  The overt Christian overtones are surprisingly pleasing; they help the film stand out, even if you're not into that kind of thing (and I'm not).  Overall, ELI is a film to see if you're a fan of the genre.  If you're not, you probably won't like it.  It's not as good as its cast and premise would have you believe, but at least it's better than a lot of what else gets handed off as action films these days.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="3rd Friday Crosses Another Dimension"></head><body><p>It was all the rage in 1982, 3-D.  Jaws did it.  Amityville did it.  Now Jason has really done it!  Most people think all F13 films are all the same.  Nothing can be further from the truth. I thought that the 2nd was pretty lame, but this one was fun.  Jason gets his props here.  He picks up his now famous hockey mask, and his legend really begins here.  Things fly out you because of the 3-D, some gimmicky, but it doesn't take away from the suspense, gore, and the fun for this third go around.  Enjoy camping out.  Turn out the lights...chhh  hhhaaa</p></body></html>

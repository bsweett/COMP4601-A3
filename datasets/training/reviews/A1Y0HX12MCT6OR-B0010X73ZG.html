Personally I loved this horror movie 20 minutes on because the truly frightening aspect of it wasn't so much the mostly shrouded monsters, but more so how people act in dire circumstances. If I were in that situation with my neighbors and townsfolk and they all as Tom Jane said "have all their electricity turned off and the s*** scared out of them, they're willing to believe anything". It's a very bleak and unflinching look at humanity, but look at Nazi Germany, look at the Donnor Party, look at the Salem Witch Trials for a few examples if you think that people would act like a rational team in horrible circumstances. Just thank the stars most of us haven't had to be in that situation.<br /><br />The monsters themselves were unique and original, and they kind of reminded me of Silent Hill 1, with very insect/dinosaur shapes. They did look a little cheesy which I think was Darabount's way to tribute to the 50's monster movies. Still their corny look was played completely sober and all of the deaths looked very gruesome and painful.<br /><br />Maybe the reason I liked the Mist so much was because of how dark and bleak the whole experience was, a man dies in vain trying to save his DoA burned brother, a local town brutally murders a local soldier, and of course there's the pitch-black ending. There were no hollywood touches on this, no silly comic relief, the cute widdle kid was pretty much comatose with fear the whole time (which is a way more realistic portrayl of kids in horror movies than I usually see). It's very refreshing to see a horror movie pull no punches.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Refreshing story of one particular marine during Gulf War #1"></head><body><p>I was reluctant to see this 2005 film.  I had read this 2003 memoir of Gulf War #1 by Marine Private Anthony Swafford and I enjoyed it.  But yet I just couldn't quite imagine it as a film.  That's because there is very little action; it's all about what's going on in the young marine's mind.  But that was the nature of that war.  There was a lot of training, a lot of waiting, lots of boredom, and lots of reporters with microphones and videotape trying to find a story where there was none.  Maybe that's why one of the things I mostly remember from that war was the soldiers playing football in the sun while wearing  full chemical retardant gear.  And this was on a desert where the average temperature was about 112 degrees Fahrenheit.<br /><br />The film got poor reviews but I was still curious.  And that's why I made sure to see it.  I'm glad I did because I found it refreshing, a war movie was about one particular soldier with a voice-over narration of well chosen words.  Jake Gyllenhaal, of Brokeback Mountain fame, is the star.  His wears a  "jarhead" crew cut and a pensive expression most of the time.  We share his anticipation, his disappointments, and his realization that all his expectations have been wrong.  He and his fellow marines have been trained and trained and then over-trained by their sergeant, played by Jamie Foxx.  There is some great surreal cinematography of the unending desert and the landscape of the oil wells aflame while the soldiers do little but come across charred bodies.  There's no heroism and when Gyllenhaal and fellow marine, Peter Sarsgaard finally think they are going to use their sharpshooter skills, their hopes are shattered by a commanding officer who refuses to let them take that shot.<br /><br />There are different kinds of wars.  And Jarhead captures the experience of Gulf War #1 magnificently.</p></body></html>

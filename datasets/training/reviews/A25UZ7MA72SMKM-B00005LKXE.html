<meta name="summary" content="Shock Schlock over Substance, but what did you expect?"></head><body><p>In "Hannibal", I was looking for an epic battle of wits between the escaped, brilliant Hannibal and the focused, brilliant Clarice. Instead, for most of the movie we get Clouseau vs. Hannibal. At the same time Clarice is getting steadily beat down within the ranks of the FBI until she is finally put on suspension. Then we find that for some reason not well explained, Hannibal regards her in some sort of fatherly way ... though a predatory father to be sure.<br /><br />While this movie had less gore than I was expecting it to, it made up for it with some very unpleasant forms of graphically displayed death. This includes not one but TWO sequences of people being eaten by hungry boars. I suppose that is fitting, since hungry bore could well describe the director and screenwriter for what essentially became a waste of time for an intelligent viewer.<br /><br />Into the mix is thrown a horribly disfigured, extremely wealthy man with a grudge against Hannibal, and Hannibal didn't even exactly do the disfiguring, though he did encourage it. In the end this man's aide turns on him to gruesome result, and the motive for THAT is as thin as it gets too.<br /><br />While "Silence of the Lambs" was riveting, this film was drivelling. Hannibal's actions were all too predictable, and the general fates of everyone involved were telegraphed virtually from the beginning of the film. After 30 years of increasingly graphic violence in film, even the "gross out" scenes in "Hannibal" brought nothing really surprising or audacious.<br /><br />After the energy put into this role by Hopkins in "Silence of the Lambs", in "Hannibal" there was surprising little personality put into the character. Hopkins played him throughout as smug, thoughtful, and vindictive, but with none of the smarmy charm or sudden outbursts that in his first performance made the character engrossing if, well, gross. Moore is no Foster, either. In only a few scenes does she try to raise a real emotion, and those seem quite subdued compared to the circumstances which are meant to provoke them. Liotta brings some real reverse charm to his character, but it is so entirely unbelievable that his efforts are wasted. Even Gary Oldman is held back to smug in a mask. How do so many fine actors fail to deliver on the promise inherent in such meaty roles? I'll have to blame the director, who was evidently going for a feel that just didn't work in the finished product.<br /><br />Sadly, Hannibal is likely to put you to sleep, sans nightmares.</p></body></html>

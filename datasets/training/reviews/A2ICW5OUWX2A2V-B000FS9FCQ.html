<meta name="summary" content="A powerful film with a chilling warning"></head><body><p>This could be the most dangerous movies of 2006.  How is that?  Well, for one thing it's main charachter is what you could call a terrorist.  Second, the film takes a hard look at the world as it may come to pass, a world where individuals set aside freedom in the name of security and peace.  If nothing else, V for Vendetta is the film that revolves around Benjamin Franklin's saying, "They that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety."<br /><br />V for Vendetta (VFV) is a creepy movie.  How so?  It shows just what could happen if Hitler and the Nazis suddenly returned, regained power and established a new dictatorship governement.  It's big brother for the twenty first century, and it's chilling.  The government is made up of cold and emotionless police and government agents who do thier job (kidnappings, beatings, etc.) with chilling efficency.  Propoganda is played on the television.  Curfews are in effect every night.  And let's not even start talking about the detainment centers...<br /><br />Seeing this big brother government of the twenty first century is chilling.  It resembles our current state of affairs pretty well, except for all the nasty dictator stuff.  The arrest scenes (where police break into homes and carry away ordinary people) are downright chilling.  This is NOT a place you want to live.  Yet it's a fascinating look at what may happen.  The story takes place sometime in the early-mid twenty first century.  The united states has broken up into civil war over the war in the middle east which has lasted for decades.  Religious fanatics have poisioned thousands in Briton.  The movie is a fascinating study into how fear will make people do crazy things to feel safe again (such as elect power hungry maniacs who promise peace).  At one point early on, V (the title charachter) tells the public to simply look in a mirror to see who is responsible for what has happened.<br /><br />It is because of this that VFV is a warning to us, that if we give in to fear, this just might happen.  But it doesn't stop there.  Oh, no, it doesn't stop there by a long shot.<br /><br />VFV is very deep on many levels.  When you see it the first time, you can tell that there's a lot here, yet you only get a glimpse at it.  When you see it a second time, you get a better grasp of the messages being put forth, yet there is still more to see and more to discover.  In many ways VFV is like the first matrix movie.  The deeper you go into the rabbit hole, the more you are going to find. There's even a great idea behind V's mask and his face, but i'll let you figure that one out for yourself (it's fantastic, I will say that much).<br /><br />Arguably the best part of the entire film is V himself.  Not since Hellboy has the silver screen seen such a fascinating comic book charachter come to life.  V is intriguing, a very polite gentleman (when he's not out killing people), a fan of movies, a good cook (very amusing scene by the way), and always has that oh-so charming smile on his face (granted it's a mask, but it works so well).  His actions make him a Han solo charachter, not totally good, not totally bad.  He can be both a freedom fighter and a terrorist, depending upon how you see his actions.  Which one is he?  The movie lets you decide that for yourself, though it does lean towards freedom fighter.  With his charming personality, black cape, black hat and that awesome mask, V is an utterly fascinating charachter who is a delight to watch.<br /><br />The movie even touches upon the subjects of religion and homosexuality in a way that can best be described as creepy.  Because religious fanatics (the film does not say what faith these fanatics were) have apparently done so much damage that religions are now completly banned.  The issue of how homosexuals are treated is truly disturbing.  In this horrible future, homosexuals are routinely arrested and have all sorts of...well, i'll let you see for yourself. It is my hope that this world does not descend to this level of barbaric cruelty.<br /><br />While VFV may be a movie about revolution, dont go in expecting lots of action.  This is a movie about ideas (this is one of the main themes) and how ideas affect people.  That's not to say that there is no action, for there are some really well done sequences (especially a big fight near the end where V really gets to show off his fighting ability with knives).  There's also some very cool shots of huge crowds at the climax, though i'll let you see that for yourself.<br /><br />Even with all the gloominess and dictatorship going around, VFV does have some very effective humor sprinkled in.  There's a fantastic moment where V cooks breakfast for Evey, and there's an absoloutly hilarious TV special halfway through the movie that had me laughing in the theater.  It's so funny that it would be a crime to reveal what it is, so i'll let you find out for yourself.<br /><br />In the end, VFV is a movie about ideas.  What can happen to those who are afraid, and how ideas are things that you cannot control or kill ("Underneath this mask is a face and underneath that is muscles and bone.  Yet I am more then that").  It's a very thought provoking movie, one that is chillingly familiar to those of us living in this age of homeland security and the conflict with terrorism.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

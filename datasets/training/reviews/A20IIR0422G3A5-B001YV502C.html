Great Action"></head><body><p>`Children of Men', directed by Alfonso Charon, and starring Clive Owen is being touted as a `Blade Runner' for the 21st Century. This blurb was the primary reason for my interest in viewing the DVD, since `Blade Runner' is easily on of the five (5) best all time Science Fiction movies.<br /><br />`Children of Men' is no `Blade Runner', and does not even have many similarities with `Blade Runner', aside from those things which every work labeled `Science Fiction' has in common with every other SciFi work and the fact that both are set in the 2020s. While `Blade Runner' is a relatively slow-paced `film noir' piece with a lot of exposition laying out the single underlying premise, `Children of Men' is a marathon of frenetic action and tension, with relatively little exposition to explain the reasons for the multiple `what if' premises which turn this into a SciFi flick. That does not mean this is a poor movie, only that comparing it to `Blade Runner' does not reveal anything insightful about the story.<br /><br />Part of the problem I had with the thinness of the exposition on the background is that there are two different premises driving the plot, and I could see no connection between the two, although there was plenty of interactions between the two premises. The first premise, clearly stated in the trailers, is the fact that the entire human population has gone infertile for the last 18 years (beginning in 2009). The second premise, working largely as the palate from which is painted the story's background is painted, is the assumption that the kind of insurgency common in Iraq today has spread to virtually all civilized countries.<br /><br />It may be that the most compelling thing about this movie is the way in which this background has been directed and filmed. The blocking and cinematography actually have a lot in common with Stephen Speilberg's first 15 minutes of `Saving Private Ryan'. The skill with which the camerawork emulates a documentary style makes one believe they are watching CNN, assuming CNN would actually air these scenes. Another movie with which `Children of Men' shares much is the recent English horror flick `28 Days Later', although `Children...' is far more original, with higher production values.<br /><br />The DVD's commentaries are a bit thin, and I'm surprised that they don't bring out the Christian allegory of the story line. While it may not be the primary theme, it should be obvious to anyone who views the movie at least twice.<br /><br />This is Clive Owen's film from start to finish. Costars Julianne Moore and Michael Caine appear in just a few short scenes each, and their top billing is primarily to highlight the importance of their scenes, which may be inadequately done by the narrative.<br /><br />This film easily has some of the socially and politically most interesting SciFi premises since `Soylent Green' and `Logan's Run', and is cinematically far more interesting than these relatively routine Hollywood products; but it won't make my list of top 10 best SciFi movies.</p></body></html>

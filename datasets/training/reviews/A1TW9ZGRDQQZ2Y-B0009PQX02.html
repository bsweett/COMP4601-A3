<meta name="summary" content="Catch This One on DVD if You Must See It!"></head><body><p>I rarely ever give a movie less than four stars, but this one was filled with so many cliches that I couldn't resist. It started off interesting, but after the first 30 minutes I was ready to leave. I stayed through until the end and sadly nothing happened to improve my impression of the film. Bruce Willis was okay, but they had him in tears at least five times if not more. Hopefully Bruce will resurrect his career (the last piece of trash film he did was "The Whole Ten Yards") with Die Hard 4.0 which will be released in 2006. Trust me on this one and wait three months or so until "Hostage" swiftly goes to DVD.</p></body></html>

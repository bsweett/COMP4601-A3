I appreciated how Spielberg was even handed in presenting the story, he showed the horror of the events in Munich in 1972, but also showed you that everything is not always black and white, this film deals in very gray areas.  I thought the acting was top notch, especially the lady who played Golda Meir and the lady that played Bana's mother, she was very powerful; she was only in a few scenes, but I was mesmerized by her.  This movie is quite long, but does not feel that way, frankly their is alot of things that have to be explained.  Bana makes his character very human, he makes mistakes and he is conflicted in the end over what he is doing, this eats at him like a cancer and his paranoia is very believable at the end.  I thought the last scene where, Bana asked Rush if he will come break bread with him, and old jewish custom, and Rush declines; and he does this right after speaking to what Israel means and what it means to be a Jew; I think that sums up to Bana what he has given up and for what.  Good film, highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""Hellboy" is a blast of action and awesome special effects!!"></head><body><p>From visionary director Guillermo Del Toro ("Blade II", "Mimic", "The Devil's Backbone") comes "Hellboy", a supernatural action-adventure based on creator Mike Mignola's Dark Horse Comics series of the same name. "Hellboy" is one of the most original and most innovative comic-book films that's ever been put on the big screen since 2000's smash hit, "X-Men" and last year's mega-hit predecessor, "X2: X-Men United"! The direction of Guillermo Del Toro was outstanding! His best work since "Blade II"! The performances of Ron Perlman ("Blade II"), John Hurt ("Captain Corelli's Mandolin"), Selma Blair ("The Sweetest Thing"), Jeffrey Tambor ("Meet Joe Black"), Karel Roden ("15 Minutes"), and Rupert Evans, in his film debut, were nothing short of excellent!<p>The film focuses on the titled hero, Hellboy (Perlman), a tall, thickly muscled battler of evil, with skin as red as...well, the planet Mars. Years ago, at the end of World War II, Hellboy emerged as a baby demon and was saved from sinister forces by the benevolent Dr. Trevor "Broom" Bruttenholm (Hurt), who raised Hellboy to be a hero. Fast forward to the year 2004 (present day): Hellboy has spent the years in virtual lockdown at Dr. Broom's Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (BPRD), where he's a prisoner of his mutant physique and -- on those occasions when he's allowed out -- his clandestine role as evil-basher. He still has his snapping tail, but he keeps his two thick horns shaved all the way down to his forehead; it's his way of trying to look ordinary -- and, more tellingly, of suppressing his demonic nature in order to do good. [In essence, Hellboy is the Hulk with rosier skin tones and the ability to talk -- at this point, a welcome quality in a magnum-lug superhero. He is also suited up for action in his leather trench coat and wields a colossal, stonelike right hand that might have been transplanted from the Thing in 'Fantastic Four'.]<p>In the midst of it all, Hellboy creates an unlikely family in Dr. Broom, the telepathic "Mer-Man" Abe Sapien (Doug Jones), and Liz Sherman (Blair), the woman Hellboy loves who can control and manipulate fire. Joining the team is young John Myers (Evans), who is recruited by Broom to become Hellboy's protector and caretaker. Hidden from society and the world that they love and protect (kind of relates to "X-Men"), Hellboy and the team must stop Rasputin (Roden), a sinister madman who seeks to reclaim Hellboy back to the Dark Side in order to use his powers to destroy mankind and bring Hell on Earth!<p>"Hellboy" has been directed, by Del Toro, with a colorfully kinetic visual imagination that almost never lets up. Del Toro, the former-art-house creep-meister turned megaplex fantasist, knows just how long to hold a shot of blood oozing through an ornate stone maze or ghouls flying through a ghostly museum so that we feel as if the sets or effects are serving the story rather than vice versa. He shows far more narrative finesse than was evident in such recent comic-book duds as "Daredevil", "The Hulk", and "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen". Perlman, acting under all that makeup, gives a somewhat funny performance of gruff sympathy that, at moments comes close to wit. And Perlman is no stranger to donning creature makeup before, especially since he played a creature in 2002's "Star Trek: Nemesis" and starred on TV's 'Beauty and the Beast', alongside Linda Hamilton.<p>The Hellboy mythology is sprinkled with references to the Nazis, Rasputin, and other sinister forces of old. The film's most colorful bad guy is Kroenen, a former occult leader of the Third Reich who wears a metal plate on top of his disfigured face and whirls twin blades around with a zesty slash of finesse. He's supposed to be a spirit of malevolence ricocheting through the ages, but I just looked at him and thought, "It's Darth Vader meets Wolverine (with less personality than either one of them)".<p>In conclusion, "Hellboy" has it all: Action, suspense, a talented all-star cast, a great storyline, and explosive special effects that six-time Academy Award winner Rick Baker ("Star Wars: A New Hope", "Men in Black", Dr. Seuss' "How the Grinch Stole Christmas") and his acclaimed Cinovation Studios can provide us with! "Hellboy" is, without a doubt, a definite DVD must-have when it's released!</p></body></html>

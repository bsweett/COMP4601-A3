<meta name="summary" content="The best war movie that I've seen!"></head><body><p>Full Metal Jacket is the 2nd Kubrick movie that I've seen and I really enjoyed it. I liked The Shining better though! Watch it!<br /><br />But this movie is different than other war movies. And it's the originality of this movie that makes it such a good movie! It's so original because it's divided into 2 parts. I preferred the 1st because it's the original part. Instead of focussing on the war like all other war movies, this part focusses on the actual training. But this training is showing the brutality and atrocity of war. But this is in the training. It shows the drill officer picking on one soldier for this whole section. Everyone hates this soldier and he suffers and is driven to madness. This part is ended by a tragic and gruesome moment. Therefore it shows not the war between the americans and vietnamese but instead the war between the americans. Or basically all of the americans against one american.<br /><br />The 2nd part is actual Vietnam. It focusses on a journalist also present in the 1st part that is in Vietnam.<br /><br />The movie is sad, violent, brutal, gruesome but very memorable. This is an excellent movie that I preferred over Saving Private Ryan. I recommend this movie to everyone wanting to watch an excellent war movie. I probably wouldn't buy it because it's hard to watch. Th acting is brilliant, notably by the drill seargeant who is very convincing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Grand Filmmaking."></head><body><p>MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD is a magnificent piece of filmmaking. The acting is superb, the historical details almost totally accurate, and great special effects. <p>The story revolves around Capt. Jack Aubrey and his crew aboard the British H.M.S. Surprise. It is 1805 and Napolean is conquering the world and now the seas. Aubrey's orders are to intercept the French ship Acheron and either destroy it or capture it. The Acheron surprises the Surprise twice and Jack vows it won't happen again.  Along the way we see the perils of life at sea and the comraderie (and sometimes displeasure) between the sailors.<p>Peter Weir hasn't made a film since THE TRUMAN SHOW and it is a delight to watch his latest achievement.  The movie is strongly story driven. However, unlike many films, the characters aren't underdeveloped.  We get a real sense of the lives of many of the shipman and we grow to like them.  There were two points in the movie where most of the audience sighed in shock as tragedy betook beloved characters.  Also, the musical score is beautiful and seems perfect for a sea-adventure film such as this.<p>I haven't read the books (yet) so I can't say how true to the spirit of the novels the movie is.  However, I can say MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD is one good yarn worth watching on the big screen at the theatre.</p></body></html>

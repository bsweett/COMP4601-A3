<meta name="summary" content="...one of the best movies ever made!"></head><body><p>The most popular superhero makes his way onto the screen with this extraordinary motion picture directed by Richard Donner (Lethal Weapon) and featuring a star studded cast including Academy Award winners Marlon Brando (The Godfather) and Gene Hackman (The Unforgiven, The French Connection), Christopher Reeve (Deathtrap), Ned Beatty (The Toy), Valerie Perrin (Lenny), and many others.<br /><br />Superman is one of the most exciting superhero flicks ever, and one of the best movies ever made!<br />You all know the story already: young Superman, Kal-el, the son of Jor-el, played remarkably by Brando, is sent to earth by his father right before his planet Krypton bursts into smithereens. He lands in a small town called Smallville, picked up by the Kent family, and raised as their own child that they name Clark. Clark grows up with unexplainable super powers, like scoring touchdowns all the time, kicking a football across the state, and racing trains and winning. Clark discovers a piece of kryptonite in the barn of his earthly parents' farm that tells him to head north, where he, or the toss of the kryptonite, builds his new home Krypton on earth where he meets the image and voice of his father who expains to him that he is not one of the humans. Years later, he's wearing tight blue pants, a red cape, and shirt that has the sign S on it. You know the rest of it so I'll stop right here.<br /><br />Superman was a major motion picture event when it was released back in 1978. It still is today despite the more advanced special effects in movies today. Gene Hackman is hilarious as Lex Luther, Superman's nemesis who plans to destroy the world and take over, while Reeve, in his first major starring role, shines as Superman, a role he would find hard later on to escape the shadow of, and pass away nearly 26 years later and be remembered for nothing more than that.<br /><br />The film is electrifying, entertaining, engaging, and absolute fun for the entire family.<br /><br />Recommended<br /><br />A</p></body></html>

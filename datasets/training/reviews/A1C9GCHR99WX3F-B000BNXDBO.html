<meta name="summary" content="This movie just make me hungry!"></head><body><p>This next month just might even make you hungary, it is Harold and Kumar go to White Castle. And it just might you want to run itno White Castle's, expect for there you have to buy more then one burger to even fill you up, their burgers are little, and I have no idea how they start out like that, you may even need 5 burgers to fill you up but if you have an extreme hungar you might need more then that, The burgers at McDonald's, Burger King, Culver's and Wendy's are just enough to get one, but sometimes you might even like a 2nd one. And White Castle's slogan is "What you crave", and don't you might hate it if you tv knows what you are thinking? We meet Harold (John Cho) at work, he works as an account, and he gets handed more worker from co-workers, who pretend they have a big metting to get off to, just so they can leave and meet the ladies. While his roomate and best friend Kumar (Kal Penn) is at an intreview for medical school with a dean (Fred Willard). So when he does return home, he is meet by Maria (Paula Garces), whom lives on the same floor, in an apartment. He cathces Kumar in his room, but they are still watch tv with each other. Not like he is mad with him, but some of Harold gets hungray, but Kumar suggesting something not delierved, and something they haven't had in a while, and then they see a commerical for White Castle. So they decided to take over, and Harold knows that there is a burger king across town, not to far away near a movie theatre, expect for when they get there, they find a burger shack there, and they check out what happened to White Castle, and they get a tip from the drive threw guy, that there is another White Castle, in Cherry Hill that is about 45 minutes away, so they make the trip, but there places to go and characters to meet before they can get to the White Castle location.</p></body></html>

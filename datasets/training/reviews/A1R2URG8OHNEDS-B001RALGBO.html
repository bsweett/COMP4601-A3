<meta name="summary" content="Good Effects, Bad Plot!"></head><body><p>"The Day After Tomorrow" is one of those movies, that when it was written, did not focus more on the dialouge and the plot, because the writer knew that it would be all about the special effects. I don't have a problem with that, because I knew that this movie would have just that, a terrible plot. They have to give us mind numbing drival to get us to the special effects. There is nothing new, and nothing exciting this storyline. The movie was also led by Dennis Quaid. I've seen only a couple of his movies including "Far From Heaven" and "The Alamo" and he was awful in both. He overacts to much, and he does that in this as well. He presents his lines with too much urgency, and too much anger. I've come to realize that he is not a good actor.<p>The movie stars him as Professor Jack Hall. He studies the weather, and has come to realize that the problem is global warming is rising. The world would be entering a new ice age soon. The vice president does not take the warning seriously, and decides to ignore it completly, even after his findings are verified by another professor Terry Rapson. The changes in weather occur right away, and it is reported that within days the Nortghen hemisphere will be gone. The problem is that Jack's son Sam is in Manhattan for a knowledge competition. A massive tidel wave hits Manhattan, eventually will be frozen, and Sam and a large group of people stay idel in the city library. It is too cold for anybody to even think about going outside. After people see others walking on the icey roads out of Manhattan, they want to leave, but Sam warns them. Jack, meanwhile, goes from Washington to New York to find his son, while his doctor wife takes care of a sick child.<p>There is absolutly nothing special about the plot, because the writer didn't care about it. He only cared about description to base the special effects upon. The good thing about the movie is that it gets right to the point. At a little over two hours, I didn't feel that this movie dragged on at all. Some breathtaking special effects sequences include twisters in Hollywood, the tidel wave in New York, and the first person to interact with the air after it is too cold to go out. I thought it was called global WARMING! "The Day After Tomorrow" has great special effects, a terrible plot, ok acting, but it is an incredable time. I recommend seeing this in the big screen because it'll make the experience so much better.<p>ENJOY!<p>Rated PG-13 for intense situations of peril.</p></body></html>

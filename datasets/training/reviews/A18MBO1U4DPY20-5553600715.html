<meta name="summary" content="THE OTHERS"></head><body><p>I watched this film because of the trailer which I found quite interesting. The film is about a mother with two children and a husband who's away at the war. At the end of the film, there were a few questions which were unanswered. I did not quite get the end of the film and it seemed more hurried than anything. The screenplay of this movie is good but all in all there's not much in it. It's not the kind of film you'd talk to people about. There were two scenes in the film that made me jump and if I say I was not frightened, I'd be a darn liar.Watch this film if only you are as curious as I am and like Nicole Kidman in a similar way.<br /><br />A five star film I would recommend to anyone who liked The Others would have to be "The Village"</p></body></html>

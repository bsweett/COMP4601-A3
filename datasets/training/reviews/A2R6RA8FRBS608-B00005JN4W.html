<meta name="summary" content="A MIND-BLOWING 2 DISC SET OF POW!"></head><body><p>This 2 DVD release of The Incredibles is truly something to rave about. The movie plot is well thought out and voiced by the actors; the cinematography, choreography and animation are superlative; and Pixar makes a movie about characters you can actually care about! The picture quality is flawless. The movie even won Best Animated Feature Film of the year at the Oscars just two weeks ago! What a coup! GRIN<br /><br />The story (as some people may know) is about a family called The Incredibles. At first Mr. Incredible is doing what any normal superhero would do, you know-save the city from destruction and balance this with family life. Then because of politics and lawsuits against superheroes as a group the family is forced into a "relocation" program because it is no longer so wonderful to be a superhero anymore! (They even are given new names to protect them against the proliferation of lawsuits against the do-gooder superhero group! Now are they the Parr family.) Mr. Incredible (now going by the name Mr. Parr) is bored and miserable (to say the least); he gets an offer to do some extra work and he takes it. (I'm keeping this part brief to avoid plot spoilers.) Ultimately, things turn rotten and then Mr. Incredible HIMSELF has to be rescued instead of the other way around! Moreover, look for some well written great scenes regarding the family's personal issues: how the people in The Incredibles family deal with being different; how Bob and his wife deal with the fact that she is comfortable as a mother while he still craves the superhero "lifestyle;" how the issue of mortality is played out; and what the children go through as they try to conceal their differences from most others in the world. Yes, the film is essentially an action movie with some violence but don't let that fool you. There are quite a few poignant moments here. The PG rating is because of a few of the action scenes; so remember that this movie is not the best choice for toddlers or children who might get upset by it. Some people also say it's a few minutes too long-again, DON'T let them or even Amazon reviewers tell you that; this movie is terrific and I was really sorry when it ended! The last hour especially is action packed and very well done!<br /><br />The movie won a second Oscar for sound editing at this year's Academy Awards ceremony; and it was nominated for an Oscar for its achievement in sound mixing but that's just the tip of the iceberg. The two DVD set is presented here with an almost endless assortment of "incredible" (!) extras! There are two full length commentaries on disc one. One commentary is by Director/Writer Brad Bird and Producer Jon Walker and some of the animators do an audio commentary on the second track. The first track is indeed more personal since the two men had such a close personal relationship; but the second track is a real must for the serious animation enthusiast who's got to know about the process of animated film production. There are so many deleted scenes! I can't remember when I saw a two DVD set with so many deleted scenes-decide for yourself which ones might have worked well in the movie! There is the exclusive short "Jack-Jack Attack" about Jack finding out he has special powers while Kari the babysitter is there with him. There's the extra "Incredi-Blunders" and TWO features (not just one) about the making of this movie. There'll be very little left unanswered for anyone after they watch both of these! The interviews with Director Brad Bird are captivating and really informative! GRIN<br /><br />Something else that is interesting is the extra "Vowellet," an essay by Sarah Powell, who voices Violet Parr: a great insight regarding Powell's perception of voicing an animated superhero. Then there's "Boundin'," a short Oscar nominated feature about a sheep with a bad haircut!  My personal favorite of the shorts would have to be "Mr. Incredible and Pals," a short made to resemble something found after being lost in a vault somewhere since the 1960s. The characters in this animated short move their mouths the way animators drew the mouths at that time. This extra includes Frozone and a mute rabbit named Mr. Skipperdoo.<br /><br />Obviously, this is a grand slam home run for Pixar-and WE reap the rewards watching it over and over again! I highly recommend this two DVD set. When choosing it, remember that this is sold in EITHER full screen or wide screen; both versions are not being sold within the same package. Regardless of which view you choose you can't go wrong since Pixar has produced the full screen version so that all the action is viewable on your screen. Go ahead; try to find a better developed and reproduced two DVD animated movie-you'd be mighty lucky to achieve this; I don't think there's anything else around as well done as this!</p></body></html>

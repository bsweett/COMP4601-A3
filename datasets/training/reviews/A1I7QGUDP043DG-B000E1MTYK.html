The scene with the dragons was one of my favorites, and the festive nature of the Irish seems 'realistic'. I had to chuckle at what I think is J.K. Rowlings feelings toward 'yellow journalists'. "Never mind the quill". I think many of us share her view of this annoying brand of news media that twists the truth. What I really adore about the entire Potter series is the way the writer has allowed Harry's character to grow up. This movie is for more mature audiences, but just as wonderful as the previous adaptations. However, you'll miss out on a lot if you don't read the book.<br /><br />Chrissy K.

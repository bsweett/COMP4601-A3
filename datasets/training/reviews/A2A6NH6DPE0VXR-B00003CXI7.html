<meta name="summary" content="Scary but full of flaws"></head><body><p>What Lies Beneath is an old fashion thriller about a house wife<br />  Michelle Pfeiffer who's upset that her only daughter is away at college.<br />  Now bored and lonely she starts snooping on the neighbers with envolves<br />  some Hitchcock ripping off. Soon after she starts seeing a ghost in<br />  her house and thinks that the guy next door killed his wife and that<br />  the ghost is her.  Her husband (Harrison Ford) who's usually sleeping or at work<br />  when she sees the ghost, of course thinks she's losing it due to her<br />  missing her daughter. ... What Lies Beneath is directed by Robert Zemeckis who's done Back<br />  to the Future, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Forest Gump throws in at<br />  least 40 false alarm boo scenes in this movie. However it is actually<br />  scary at times, there was some scenes where it left me at the edge<br />  of seat. The movie is more funny than scary though, critics call it<br />  a Hitchcock rip-off but I found it to be a Hitchcock parody. A fun<br />  thriller that you can't take too seriously. Although I somewhat liked<br />  the film I think Zemeckis has another great movie in him and unfortunely<br />  this wasn't it.</p></body></html>

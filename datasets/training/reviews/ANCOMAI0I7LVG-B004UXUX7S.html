I just feel that the world, much like with Johnny Depp, is too late to this party.  I mean, back in the 90's, Depp was amazing.  When does the world take notice?  When he stars in that Disney `pirate' movie.  Back in the early aughts, Clooney was starring in quality films with varying subjects and smart directors who knew how to use him.  When does the world embrace him?  When he gets obnoxiously political and starts starring in a slew of pretentious films pretending to be smart.<br /><br />And I thought `Up in the Air' was bad.<br /><br />`The Descendants', as expected, was high on Oscar's radar.  They love Clooney now.  Sadly, this film is a complete misstep in that it just appears so surface; so miniscule.  It is trying to say so much about family and heritage and the preservation of both (literally and then again figuratively portrayed by the Hawaiian landscape).  Instead of getting into the heart of it though, `The Descendants' throws a slew of unlikable characters at us and expects us to weed through their flaws to find ourselves.  I've never in my life wanted to hit so many people.  Sadly, Alexander Payne forgot how to make movies.  I mean, `Sideways' and `About Schmidt', while not perfect, were really well done films  that haunted in certain ways.  With this film, Payne merely resorts to layering his ill-conceived drama with a bunch of poorly executed `monologues' that are supposed to amount to something in the end but wind up amounting to a lot of hot air.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Matt King, a lawyer who is trustee to a lot of beautiful land his family left to him and his cousins.  His cousins (or at least most of them) want to sell the land and make a fortune.  Matt is old school and believes in working for his money and so he deprives his family of an overtly rich life.  He has lost touch with his wife, who has been having an affair behind his back and planned on leaving him.  His eldest daughter is wayward and his youngest daughter is confused.  Oh, and his wife was in a severe accident and is on life support.  This obiovusly makes him reflect on his life and go soul searching (sort of) and blah blah blah.<br /><br />Shailene Woodley is rather excellent here, but the rest of the cast is so uneven.  Clooney is wooden and somewhat phones this in.  Amara Miller is annoying.  I wanted to run Nick Krause over with my car (seriously, a film trying to be this poignant should not resort to such depths of stereotypical clich&eacute;s).  What is Matthew Lillard doing in this movie?  Judy Greer seemed promising and then she had that ridiculous outburst in the hospital that made me laugh out loud.<br /><br />UGH, and this won an Oscar!  Seriously, the script is really skeletal and needed so much more fleshing out to make it feel well rounded.  Instead, this just became so faux important.  I hate that Clooney picks these films that attempt to be taken seriously but say so little about the subject they are pretending to know so much about.<br /><br />And if you have to basically read us the book through voice over narration during the film's opening ten minutes just to get us on track with the film then maybe you should rethink your scripting approach.</p></body></html>

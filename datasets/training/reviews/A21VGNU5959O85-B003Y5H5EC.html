You can turn on the TV any given day and see some news station, talk show host or investigative report on child predators. Lately we have all been subjected to the Amber Alerts, Megan's Law, the pictures of the innocent children who we all know are dead, and the new phenomenon on dateline NBC where people pose as children to lure predators to houses than they ambush them, confront them than arrest them. I am sure that the public outcry if not deftly handled by law enforcement would result in many a pedophile being strung up. These men and women, too many people, get off too easily. They have to register as sex offenders, have their pictures on websites and wear ankle bracelets, not a fitting punishment for someone who hurts children for a living.<br /><br />This movie takes that concept of "payback" to a whole new level, and asks *what if the child took the upper hand* What If a 14 year old girl, researches and finds predators, hunts them down and makes them pay? What on earth could she do? The answer is *a lot* Hailey is a smart, precocious, crafty little bundle of vengeance, and it wasn't too far fetched to see her doing what she did. I know a lot of reviewers say it was unrealistic, that no 14 year old is that smart or strong, I would like to point out that maybe their children are just not that way, but there are those out there who are living beyond normal potential. Adrenaline, smart planning, and common sense outweigh age any day.<br /><br />It is a raw and brutal movie, not for the squeamish or faint at heart. At times you are asking yourself if you feel sorry for this man, or if Hailey is the monster, I have to admit in the end I wasn't crying for his loss.<br /><br />I love the instances throughout the movie of<br /><br />--choosing between embarrassment and shame or bodily harm.<br /><br />-- underestimating your prey<br /><br />This isn't a family movie, or a movie to show children what so ever, its not a movie to show the dangers of the computer or stranger danger, it's a movie for adults who have ever enjoyed the "ole switcharoo" scenario. Totally worth seeing.</p></body></html>

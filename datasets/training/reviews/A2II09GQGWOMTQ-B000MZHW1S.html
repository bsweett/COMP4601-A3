<meta name="summary" content="Great movie."></head><body><p>I can see there are over three hundred reviews for this movie.<br />What can I add to the discussion?<br />Probably not much lol.<br />I'll make it short.<br />The good.<br />Everything.<br />Excellent story, excellent acting, perfect direction, pacing, score, you name it, it was done well.<br /><br />The bad?<br />Some people have said this movie is a tad preachy and yeah, it is but it wasn't enough to make me deduct any stars.<br /><br />After seeing Leo in Shutter Island I finally decided to revisit his older work and I'm glad I did.<br /><br />An excellent film and a must see.<br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

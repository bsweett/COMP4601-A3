<meta name="summary" content="Roger O. Thornhill: Ad exec by day, spy by night?"></head><body><p>NORTH BY NORTHWEST is by far my favorite Hitchcock thriller. It's a genuine nail biter throughout, with several excellent action sequences, a wonderful cast, superb story and a climax that remains 50 years later one of the greatest of all time! This film belongs in all home video libraries.<br /><br />SYNOPSIS--<br />Advertising executive Roger Thornhill (Grant) is mistaken for CIA agent George Kaplan by a gang of spies headed by the evil Phillip Vandamm (Mason). He's captured, almost killed and barely escapes. To clear himself of a murder charge, Thornhill tries to locate the real Kaplan, with the aid of beautiful Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint). After just missing Kaplan in Chicago, the search continues. Thornhill has no idea of the many dangers ahead!<br /><br />NORTH BY NORTHWEST is also available on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002IQEHI">DVD</a>.<br /><br />Cary Grant and Alfred Hitchcock made three other pictures together:<br />SUSPICION (1941)  (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6304119097">VHS edition</a>)  (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002HOEOY">DVD edition</a>)<br />NOTORIOUS (1946)  (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6301798503">VHS edition</a>)  (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D8W7EK">DVD edition</a>)<br />TO CATCH A THIEF (1955)  (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6300215741">VHS edition</a>)  (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JJX8">DVD edition</a>)<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 viewer poll rating found at a film resource website.<br /><br />(8.6)  North by Northwest (1959) - Cary Grant/Eva Marie Saint/James Mason/Jessie Royce Landis/Leo G.

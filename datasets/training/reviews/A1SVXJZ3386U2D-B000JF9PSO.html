I waited for it to come to our town but I kept waiting and waiting until I finally asked the theater owner what the delay was all about.  He said that they weren't going to show it because there hadn't been any demand for it.  I said that he ought to at least show it for a week and find out for sure but it never came.  I had heard that it was intense and realistic and, of course, most of us already knew what "United 93" was about just from the title.  I had also heard that it was rather low-budget; no "names" in the cast, the camera-work seemed hand-held, and a few other comments that are usually reserved for "B movies".  However, despite whatever disclaimers I heard, I also understood that the film had an impact on those who saw it.<br /><br />I rented "United 93" the other night and I am still immersed it.  This movie is very professionally made and it grabs you right from the beginning.  There is a lot that we see unfolding before us that we already understand.  It is impressive how the air traffic controllers are intitially curious then mystified then appalled.  The film-makers could have just assumed the audience knew all the background (which we still do) and focus on the lives of the victims leading up to climax of the taking and retaking of the plane.  In other words, they could have made the typical Hollywood disaster film.  By retracing the events of 9/11 sequencially we relived the event and found a conclusion to the one aspect that remained a mystery.<br /><br />I do not know how much the film relied on second-hand witness accounts (the film reminds us of the many calls to loved ones from the passengers on board).  I don't recall if the black box was recovered in tact.  However, I was satisfied with the reaction of the paasengers and their conclusion of hijacking.  These were not people portrayed as heroic.  Rather, they were portrayed like ourselves as people independently traveling for reasons of their own.  The development of a group focus was excellently done and the ultimate sacrifice that they made for ourselves and themselves was the chaotic effort of amateurs with a cause.<br /><br />For many of us, 9/11 was a mixture of anger, sorrow, fear and insecurity.  Yet there was courage and pride in that mix as well.  From the NY Police Departments to the NY Fire Departments to the passengers of United 93 we had a lot to be proud of.  Nothing I've seen brings that out as much as the movie "United 93".</p></body></html>

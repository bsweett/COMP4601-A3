<meta name="summary" content="Grab your whip &amp; fedora---INDIANA JONES IS HERE ON DVD!"></head><body><p>At last--The Indiana Jones series comes to DVD with THX surround sound &amp; enhanced visuals. John Williams' music soars throughout the trilogy.<p>Raiders of the Lost Ark---No doubt the best of the three. Indy must find the Ark of the Covenant.<p>Temple of Doom: Indy must find 3 sacred stones and escape a deadly cult. 1st movie in history to get a PG-13 rating. Scary stuff...but good.<p>Last Crusade: Indy &amp; his dad (Sean Connery) must find the Holy Grail.</p></body></html>

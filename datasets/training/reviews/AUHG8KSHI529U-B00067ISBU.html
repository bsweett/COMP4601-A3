<meta name="summary" content="A fun movie with great visuals and fine characterizations"></head><body><p>This is a fun movie.  I love the way the movie looks and the attitude it takes towards its characters.  The actors give the characters just enough depth to give them a sense of being a part of a real world and yet they have enough swagger and attitude so we know it is a cartoon come to life.  Guillermo Del Toro has to be thanked for pulling this off so well.<br /><br />Ron Perlman does a superb job in realizing Hellboy.  I mean, come on!  How many actors could put on a suit that strange looking and still bring off a character that you understand with feelings and how he relates to other people?  Too bad it will be dismissed in the serious crowds because it is a cartoon character - this is a fine acting job.<br /><br />Selma Blair is touching as the firestarter who is terrified of a power she hasn't yet learned to control.  She also has mixed feelings towards Hellboy who is completely possessed by her.  It is a good match with the right mix of troubles for a movie.<br /><br />Jeffrey Tambor also adds so much to the movie with some very nice touches as Tom Manning.  His character both covers for Hellboy and views him as a bit of a problem.  Towards the end of the movie there are some nice moments as the two come to a better understanding.<br /><br />Rupert Evans is just fine as John Meyers who is the reluctant new person in charge of taking care of Hellboy.  Fresh from Quantico it is his first assignment and his youth and inexperience show, as does his good heart.<br /><br />And what can one say about John Hurt?  He is fabulous as Hellboy's "father".  Kevin Trainor is the younger version of Trevor Bruttenholm and his brief but energetic performance sets a great foundation for all that follows.<br /><br />Doug Jones provides the physical characterization of Abe Sapien.  Abe's voice is provided by David Hyde Pierce.  Abe is a good character who adds quite a bit to the story, but must have been a monster of a role to enact.  I can't imagine the difficulty of acting in that costume.<br /><br />What is a movie without villains?  This one has three very sinister ones.  Of course, their being Nazis makes them that much more evil.  Karel Roden as Grigori isn't really a Nazi, but was working with them at the beginning of the movie.  He is the head villain.  He has a girlfriend who is gorgeously played by Biddy Hodsen.  Ladislav Beran makes Kroenen the creepiest thing in the movie.  The bad guys and gals really add the spice to this movie.<br /><br />Don't expect high art here, but do expect surprisingly effective characterizations and a quality of acting far above most movies based on comic book characters.<br /><br />The extras on this disk include two commentaries that do add to your appreciation of the film and the ability to visit the sets at various points while watching the film.  All pretty cool stuff.</p></body></html>

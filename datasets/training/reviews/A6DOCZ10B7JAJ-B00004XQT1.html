<meta name="summary" content="You're psycho not to love this film"></head><body><p>What's for dinner tonight?  Squid ravioli or a swordfish meatloaf w/ onion marmalade?  Or what 5 star restaurant has the best bathroom to do some coke in?  These are the type of questions Patrick Bateman (Bale) and his co-workers face in American Psycho.<br />This movie is a satirical look at yuppie Wall Street America.  Bateman does have an unsquenchable bloodlust lingering beneath his pristine corporate image.  But there are some surreal aspects to the fatal crimes that makes you wonder what's factual and what's merely a product of his imagination.<br />The 80's setting is really captured through the music that Patrick Bateman listens to and adores.  And yes, there is a strong hint that if you love Huey Lewis, Phil Collins, Robert Palmer, and Whitney Houston, you're crazy too.<br />Plus you're probably a little psycho if you use six different facial & body cleansers, along with your daily mudd mask, anti-aging eye balm, and after-shave lotion with little or no alcohol (because alcohol dries the skin).<br />There are many other instances where this movie pokes fun at vain and shallow people.  It also leaves unanswered questions that are fun to contemplate.  I give it a big thumbs up.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An epic"></head><body><p>Kingdom of Heaven is an epic movie with an epic length. The acting is good, with many great actors. The plot and costumes are excellent and sets the stage. The battle scenes are choreographed and well shot. I'm no fan of big epics, but Kingdom was a good movie.</p></body></html>

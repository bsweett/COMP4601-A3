<meta name="summary" content="Oh, man......where do I start with this?"></head><body><p>After seeing this in the theater, I left convinced that the Kill Bill saga (both 1 & 2 together) is Tarentino's best wotk.  Seeing Vol.2 on DVD just reinforced that opinion.  From the very opening with the haunting piano....it seemed like it was destined to more than the action-fest of the first installment.  We're treated to the full story of how the 'wedding massacre' went down proving that the event was far more brutal and traitorous than any of us could of imagined.<br /><br />The biggest questions of all left from vol.1 (why and why, to certain issues) are all wrapped up nicely here.  Bill, is sadistic and insane, of course; but he might not be the cold-blooded psycho we expect him to be.<br /><br />By the way....the shot of the Bride and Pai Mei doing the animal forms in synch with each other in front of the red backdrop has to be the single coolest thing I've ever seen in a movie.</p></body></html>

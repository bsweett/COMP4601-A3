But what gets me is the fact that she's really the only one who got the attention despite the fact that three other performances carry this movie just as well as she does, and one of them even outshines her quite a bit.  This is truly an extraordinary movie because it had all the potential to become nothing more than summer comedy tripe but instead, thanks to the wonderful script and brilliant comedic performances, it became one great movie.  From Streep's Cruella turn to Hathaway's wide-eyed innocence to Tucci's comedic timing to the magnificent scene stealing Blunt in what should have landed her an Oscar, everyone here contributes to the greatness that is `The Devil Wears Prada'.<br /><br />The film follows Andrea, a young journalist looking to make it big who finally gets a shot when she interviews for Miranda Priestly, editor of a New York fashion magazine.  She gets the job despite the fact that Miranda seems disinterested in her, but soon she finds that her new found profession may not be what she's been praying for.  Miranda is ruthless, able to be so successful because she has no heart, but this again is further proof that all that awards attention was justified.  Streep plays Priestly with so much conviction and emotion.  She's cold hearted and distant, but Streep gives her layers that we can find if we're willing to look.<br /><br />The question though is will Miranda destroy Andrea's good natured soul?<br /><br />Anne Hathaway is just darling in this film.  I'm really excited for where her career is headed.  I do feel bad for her in the fact that so far she's been in two films garnering other members of her cast awards attention while she just sits back and watches.  Maybe more so with `Brokeback Mountain' since everyone BUT her received an Oscar nomination, but even here when her performance was far more leading than Streep's yet Streep stole her thunder.  Alas, her performance is still memorable and I'm sure this young star is bound for some attention in the near future.  Stanley Tucci is also fantastic here as Priestly's right hand man.  He takes Andrea under his wing and shows her the ropes, helping her to make it in the cut throat world belonging the Miranda.  He's hilarious to watch, but still can't rise above the brilliance that is Emily Blunt.  Her performance here is comedic bliss.  She has the most memorable lines in the film, and her character is a piece of heaven.  Why she got passed up for the nomination for the 6-year old (8, 9 whatever) from the Sunshine movie is beyond me!<br /><br />So, the movie is great, literally.  I was actually shocked to like it as much as I did.  The plot may not really be anything new, and the moral lesson may be the same generic been-there-done that `learn to be a good person and not let the world change you just so you can succeed' type plot that most movies in this genre possess but it does it in such a fresh and exciting way that it's worth every single second.  So yes, Streep is brilliant and deserves the praise, but let's not forget the equally impressive performances that only added to her screen brilliance.</p></body></html>

They were never scary, but the theme of a bunch of na?ve teens having to combat an undead supervillian never grows old. I've always been a bigger fan of Jason in all honesty, preferring his 'silent but violent' approach to Freddy's 'make 'em laugh to death' style, but both series of movies have their moments. You don't expect Oscar winning performances or scripts when you watch a slasher flick, do you? (if you do, you're an idiot) The characters of Jason and Freddy have become bigger than their own franchises...their fans watch to see their 'hero' (lol) appear on screen and cheer as they kill the deliberately stupid and poorly acting characters in a variety of original ways. Continuity has also worked quite well throughout the series too. I've seen one review on here complain that he is a 'hardcore fan' and that Jason's mask is missing it's axe-mark (from the end of Friday 13th part 3) and Jason himself is missing his blind eye. Such a 'hardcore fan' should have noticed Jason getting a new mask at the start of Part 8 (Jason Takes Manhattan), after his old one was split in half at the end of Part 7 (The New Blood) and actually being 'reborn' in Jason Goes To Hell. And as for Freddy feeding from souls, not fear...well, Freddy has been feeding from fear ever since the original 'Nightmare', when Nancy actually defeated him by not being afraid of him. But I digress...<br /><br />Freddy vs Jason, for all it's years in the making and various script rewrites is surprisingly good...my only misgiving with it (as a staunch Jason fan) is that it feels like much more of a 'Freddy' film than a 'Jason' one. But the best elements from both series are all present and correct...na?ve teens, intentionally exaggerated characters (unfortunately, most people view this as unintentionally poor acting and miss the point completely), deaths which are so over the top and savage that they're actually funny (think Itchy & Scratchy style violence) and an exciting climax which, as ever, leaves the film wide open for a sequel. It isn't the best movie ever made, and certainly isn't better than the best examples from the 2 series on which it's based (Friday 13th Part 6: Jason Lives is still a comedy-horror masterpiece in my opinion, along with the amusing demise of Johnny Depp, in the first 'Nightmare' film, lol), but it's very entertaining and has much respect for the history and legacies of both of it's 'stars', unlike Paul Anderson's utterly pathetic Alien vs Predator (possibly one of the worst films ever made). The critics that have completely savaged this film are the sort of people who did not like the other Freddy or Jason films (apart from maybe their first appearances). Freddy vs Jason is made by fans, for fans, and doesn't disappoint the true fans of either series at all. As I've mentioned before, it's infinitely more entertaining, and has a much more satisfying climax than Paul Anderson's AvP movie which is a real example of how a great idea can go belly up in the wrong hands.<br /><br />The last thing I want to mention is the possibility of a Freddy/Jason/Evil Dead crossover at some point...although everybody noticed the hand of Freddy drag Jason's mask down to Hell at the end of Jason Goes To Hell (which sparked the whole 'Freddy vs Jason' rumour), nobody seems to have noticed that in the same film, the Book of the Dead made an appearance, and the dagger from the Evil Dead movies was actually used to send Jason to Hell. Bruce Campbell vs the Krueger/Voorhees tag team? You read it here first...</p></body></html>

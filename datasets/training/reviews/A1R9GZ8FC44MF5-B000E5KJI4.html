<meta name="summary" content="One of the best films ever made."></head><body><p>I think Alexander will probably win the best pic oscar this year, but this is definetly a very close second.  Its really one of the best films ever made, and definetly one of the best this year.  Its alittle better then The Last Samurai but not much.  Gladiator is alittle better but again not much, this is very close to Gladiator but Alexander looks like it could be better then Gladiator.  Anyway back to this.  It has a great story, sure its different but its more interesting that way, why would you pay 10 bucks to see a movie about something youve heard a million times before.  Its got great very well choreographed fights (esspecially the one between Pitt and Bana, the climatic fight and the best part of the movie) and grand scale battles.  Its got an oscar caliber performance from Bana, and great performances by everyone else.  Its got great cinematography and visuals, a great score, and powerful drama.  Definetly a 10 out of a 10.  If you liked Gladiator then you should like this basically just as much, they are very close in terms of how great they are.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An excellent zig-zagging thriller with an actual adult character for Aniston, who shows new depth"></head><body><p>Derailed is full of surprises, not the least of which is that Jennifer Aniston, freed from romantic comedy, both on television and film, is an actress of surprising weight and darkness.<br /><br />This point is driven home early, when the sexy flirtations give way without warning to something different, in a sudden change of direction, and the film has more on the way.<br /><br />The film's not perfect -- Clive Owen's protagonist does several very dumb things along the way, when the alternative really isn't much worse, and in one case, what he does is almost unthinkably worse than what he's been threatened with -- and the big secret of the plot can be put together before Clive's character stumbles on it, but it's still an effective and affecting thriller.<br /><br />Strongly recommended for thriller fans and especially for anyone who thought that maybe, just maybe, Jenifer Aniston had more of a future ahead of her than just an endless series of Meg Ryan-style romantic comedies.</p></body></html>

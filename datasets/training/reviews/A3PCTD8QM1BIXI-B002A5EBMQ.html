<meta name="summary" content="Great adaption of a classic tv show"></head><body><p>Charlie's Angels is one of the few movies next to the MI series that is a good adaption of the tv show on which it is based. All of the angels are perfectly cast and the action sequences directed by MCG are tight. Bill Murray is very funny as Bosely and it's a shame he wasn't be in the sequel. All in all good fun.</p></body></html>

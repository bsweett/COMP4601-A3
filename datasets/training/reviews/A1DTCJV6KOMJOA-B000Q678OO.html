<meta name="summary" content="Classical music set to sheer destuction. Briliant!"></head><body><p>Over the years &quot;...Orange&quot; has changed upon my intial viewing I was horrifed at the images of rape and uniformity and I still am! But recently my nephew Ronald and I sat down and watched it together he is a 16 year old male and for some reason he was unfased by he images so i ran out and brought the novel for him to read since it may spark a more clearer image of horror in his imagination but alas he laughed the thre film and the novel and that made me watch the film again and realize the true genuis behind it. Kubrick used classical music the music of beauty and intellect to propell a barbaric act of violence but violence isn't barbaric at all it is what keeps the world moving and is the driving force behind human nature. My nephew is of a different time then myself the visuals of blood and guns is nothing new but if you truly want to see th real life telling of A Clockwork Orange just turn on the tv and view how we set modern day music to the most barbaric emtions of all self loathing for the act love. Kubrick may have known that as the years past that humans would revert human nature to a point where the public wishes to throw away our origins of being human!</p></body></html>

Russel Crowe (Gladiator) is wonderful as the captain of a ship that's trying to track down a dangerous French warship. The warship attacks his ship in an excellent battle in the beginning of the film. After that Crowe is determined to stop it. Pail Bettany (A Beautiful Mind, A Knights Tale) is also fantastic as the ships doctor and Crowe's bestfriend. The ship battles are excellent and entertaining but there's not really a lot of that. There's a lot more dialogue and scenes where we get to know the crew of the ship. Bettany surprisingly makes a lot of this movie his own. He has great scenes with Crowe and also touching scenes with a boy on ship who he takes under his wing and teaches about animals and nature. Some people will think there's not enough action but it's still an excellent film. When there is action it's very good, the scenery is very nice, directing great and Bettany gives what should've been an oscar nominated performance.</p></body></html>

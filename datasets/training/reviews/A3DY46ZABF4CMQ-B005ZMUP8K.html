<meta name="summary" content="Depp [delivers] an extraordinary performance once again"></head><body><p>Pirates Of The Carribean: Curse of the Black Pearl was an enjoyable, creepy and funny pirate movie. Dead Man's Chest, the film's first of many sequels to come, has Johnny Depp (Donnie Brasco) delivering an extraordinary performance once again, but the movie overall gets washed away into the sea with the Black Pearl.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed some of the film's action sequences, but it didn't awaze me as much as the original did (maybe I'm not a pirate fan after all!). What struck me about Pirates 2 were the cliches (a disgusting Octopus-like creature using its arms to snatch people and destroying the ship has been used before, and is used twice in the film), Depp's satirical performance (running around tied to a barbeque stick), and the cliffhanger ending (brace yourselves for a Pirates 3 movie coming out soon!).<br /><br />Maybe it is me, but Pirates 2 really didn't cause me to jump, cheer, and go insane. Maybe I'm getting old to watch all these Disney films, or maybe the film itself is lacking substance or new material to deliver. It's up to you to judge. One thing I can assure you of is that Pirates 2 is a much better sequel than Superman Returns. Unlike the latter, Pirates succeeds in staying true to its predecessor.<br /><br />Mildly recommended<br /><br />C</p></body></html>

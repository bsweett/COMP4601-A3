<meta name="summary" content="Terrific political thriller"></head><body><p>In 1972, during the summer Olympics in Munich, Germany Palestinian terrorists killed 2 members of the Israeli wrestling team and kidnapped 9 others.  They along with all 9 Olympians were ultimately killed before leaving the country.  Although some of the eventual operation to assassinate those responsible remains secret, much is known as well.  Based on George Jonas' novel "Vengeance", director Steven Spielberg fills in the gaps with this excellent thriller.  Eric Bana gives a powerful performance as the leader of a 5 man operation assigned the task of killing the leaders responsible for the attack.  The group surprisingly is not an elite unit in the usual sense.  Avner (Bana) is a mid level Mossad agent but had worked as a body guard for Prime Minister Golda Meir.  The other 4 are similarly a bit out of their element.  Although the film clearly separates the good guys from the bad guys, Spielberg still manages to make each character sympathetic in some way.  Avner and others in the group confront moral choices.  Is this murder or justice?  The film has a top notch cast including Geoffrey Rush as the Unit's government contact, Daniel Craig as the driver and the Unit tough guy.  Mathieu Amalric is especially effective as the French connection that helps with locations and logistics.  The film focus however is on Avner and begins to meanders a bit as his episodes of depression result in flashbacks to the original terrorist attack.  I guess that keeps him and us centered on why the mission is necessary.  Overall this is a fine political thriller based on real events.</p></body></html>

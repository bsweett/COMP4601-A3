The rest of the main cast, particularly Owen, Plummer and Foster, all put in great performances.<br /><br />The story is about a bank robbery/hostage situation. It's got something of The Usual Suspects twist, but it's hardly that original or surprising.<br /><br />In some ways, it's almost as spoof of bank robbery/hostage movies. The greatest film in that category, Dog Day Afternoon is even referenced in this movie.<br /><br />Lest I be misunderstood, this is a very entertaining film.  As art, however, it lacks some depth.  It's probably worth the full price of admission, but it's not so stellar that you'd be missing out by waiting for it to hit the video stores.<br /><br />3.5 stars. The good acting and suspense save it from its lack of originality.</p></body></html>

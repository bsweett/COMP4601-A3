<meta name="summary" content="Very Impressive OMEN"></head><body><p>I think this is the best of the OMEN trilogy. It is definitely the most believable for this genre. Sam Neil is very good as Damien. Powerful Gerry Goldsmith score and great cinematography and atmosphere are outstanding. There is gratuitous violence and killings along the way but these are played down and are very low-key compared to this film's predecessors. For instance, the outrageous violence was the focus of the second OMEN film. This film puts these on the backburner and focuses on the central characters and theme. This is a very impressive film.</p></body></html>

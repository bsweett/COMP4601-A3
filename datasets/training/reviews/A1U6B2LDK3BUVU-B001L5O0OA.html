<meta name="summary" content="Nice kick, Santa"></head><body><p>There are some strengths to this movie.  The marriage we get to witness is a terrific one.  The father and mother love each other and the children.  It is not a wealthy family.  It is an average family.  I can't believe that one of the reviewers on this site complained that the family was grimy.  That is one of the few strengths of this film, that the family is ordinary rather than wealthy and proper.<br /><br />My favorite moment of the movie is when Santa Claus gives the little boy a kick.  It's the only real laugh in the film.<br /><br />As for the rest of it, it's a children's film, and if you like that sort of thing, you will like this.<br /><br />The bullying that takes place in the movie is disturbing.  I don't see any humor in it.  Bullying is no joke.  I was glad to see that the little boy gave the bully hell, eventually.  But it really isn't the kind of subject to make light of, and this movie does make light of it.  Oh well, haha, a neighborhood bully is tormenting the kids again, no big deal.<br /><br />To sum up, I like the love in this ordinary family, and for a kids movie it isn't too bad.</p></body></html>

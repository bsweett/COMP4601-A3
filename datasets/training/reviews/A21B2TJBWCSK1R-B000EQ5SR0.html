This movie was something of a gamble as the show only managed to spawn a small, but dedicated cult following. Now, comes along a big budget movie starring Charlize Theron as the eponoymous protagonist. Unfortunately, the show's creator had no input into the movie which only further alienates it from the fan base. However, I think fans will be pleasantly surprised at just how faithful the movie is to the show.<br /><br />Charlize Theron certainly has Aeon's emotionless attitude down cold and is more than up for her character's athleticism. It is an extremely physically demanding role that she is more than capable of, showing an impressive prowess. However, Marton Csokas is miscast as Trevor. He doesn't look like his animated counterpart nor does he act like him - a lecherous powermonger. Csokas goes in the opposite direction as a quietly confident leader.<br /><br />This film has top notch production design and special effects with well-choreographed action sequences often accompanied by the requisite techno music. The sterile, futuristic look, flashy martial arts and Orwellian society is reminiscent of Equilibrium, although its action sequences were much better as was its kinetic editing - something that this movie could have used more of. In an interesting twist, all of this society's top assassins are women and, like in the Kill Bill movies, there are ferocious fight scenes between highly trained and very dangerous women, each with their own unique skills.<br /><br />The animated series was a fantastic example of abstract sci-fi surrealism and to capture that in a live-action movie is a difficult task to say the least. The film tries to have it both ways. It's not quite abstract as it should be and is not as pedestrian as it could have been. Watching this movie, it's easy to see why it failed to capture a mainstream audience. It's too abstract for most and not abstract enough for the show's fans, leaving it in an odd state of limbo.<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by Charlize Theron and the film's producer Gale Anne Hurd. Theron talks about the challenges of the intense, physical training she underwent for this role and then Hurd, in turn, praises her physical prowess. This is fairly decent track and both commentators are engaging.<br /><br />Also included is a commentary by the film's screenwriters Phil Hay and Matt Manfredi. They point out connections between the film and the animated series. They also talk about how much exposition was needed to set up this world and how the challenge is to tell enough but not to overwhelm or bore the audience.<br /><br />"Creating a World: Aeon Flux" examines the challenge of adapting an experimental, non-narrative cartoon into a Hollywood movie. We see Peter Chung visiting the set and marveling at his drawings being brought to life.<br /><br />"The Locations of Aeon Flux." Kusama originally wanted to shoot in Brasilia because it had an ideal, futuristic look that was surrounded by jungle. It wasn't practical for them to shoot there so Berlin was their next choice because it also had futuristic looking architecture.<br /><br />"The Stunts of Aeon Flux." Charlize Theron trained hard for this role. She came from a dancing background so she was very flexible - an ideal attribute for her character. It's amazing to see the level of commitment she had for this movie and the fact that she did 95% of her own stunts!<br /><br />"The Costume Design Workshop of Aeon Flux" takes a look at how the film's many costumes were designed and then made. They took their inspiration from the film The Conformist (1970).<br /><br />"The Craft of the Set Photographer on Aeon Flux." He took pictures on the set for publicity stills and sometimes even for the film's poster. He shows us the various lenses he uses and gives a little insight into how he works.</p></body></html>

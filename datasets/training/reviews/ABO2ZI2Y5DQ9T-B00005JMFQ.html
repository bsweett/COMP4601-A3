<meta name="summary" content="Love Is All Around; Enjoyable, But Actually Too Much Around"></head><body><p>[Actually, my rating is 3.5 stars.]<p>No one can deny the fact that Richard Curtis is one of the best screenwriters in the world.  And yes, "Love Actually" confirms the fame again.  But as to his directoral skills, "Love" actually shows that it is short of the ones' such as Roger Mitchell who did in "Notting Hill."  In short, good, but not great.<p>"Love Actually" has many (including potential) couples in love, and too many, I am afraid.  Hugh Grant as Prime Minister of UK is in love with his chubby secretary while Emma Thompson plays a wife of Alan Rickman, in whose office Laura Linney works, who is in love with a hunky guy, and so on and on.  However, though the film includes the stars like Keira Knightley, Colin Firth, Rowan Atkinson, and Liam Neeson, the screentime alloted to each actor is too short for any character they play to fully engage our attentions.<p>That does not mean the film is boring.  On the contrary, it has a lot of witty dialogues of Richard Curtis, the same kind of funny lines you enjoyed in "Four Weddings and a Funeral."  But as you keep watching on, you will probably some stories should be left in the cutting room.  Actually, two (or three) couples' stories are not interesting at all.  And the slightly political satire on the US-UK relation (represented awkwardly by the US President Billy Bob Thornton) clearly sticks out.  We need romance here, not political comments, even wrapped with laughter.<p>Among the many actors, it is Bill Nighy who steals the show, as an ex-rocker whose acid tongue cannot be kept silent even on the air.  The way how this down-and-out, die-hard rocker sings his awful version of "Love Is All Around" (used in "Four Wedding" by Wet Wet Wet) is a real pleasure to see, and you can find him in every funny moment of the film.<p>"Love Actually" is too long, and its story clutters with too many characters.  It is a fun to see it, but no one would complain if Richard Curtis concentrate his enormous talent on writing only in the future.</p></body></html>

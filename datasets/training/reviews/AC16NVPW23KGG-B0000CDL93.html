<meta name="summary" content="Collectors Edition is Top Notch"></head><body><p>This is a cinematic masterpiece by Oliver Stone. I think that this film along with the Doors and Platoon rank among his best works. Stone certainly does capture the essence of the 1960s America. I bet that he could easily remake Easy Rider and it might top the original! Film is based on the late Jim Garrison's memoirs and Jim Marr's &quot;Crossfire&quot;. There is a cast of a thousands in this one(COSTNER, JONES, PESCI, SPACEK, LEMMON, MATTHAU, CANDY, BACON, SUTHERLAND) and includes excellent music by John Williams. JFK won a well deserved OSCAR for editing and it shows. There is a unique and quite riveting mix of actual footage with re-created footage of assassination in Dallas.  The collector's edition includes several plusses. The theatrical trailer is just as riveting as film itself. The B- disk includes several deleted scenes. I felt that Stone should have left in the scene involving the Colorado businessman offering Garrison a bribe if he would stop the investigation. There is a sequence involving man-X that was the original ending(Stone felt, initially, that the Man-X and Costner exchange needed an intermission in order for audiences to absorb all of that intense information connecting the military-Pentagon involvment) of the film, and there was a great deal of ending credits that were cut explaining how Garrison was indicted for bribery following the Shaw Trial, de Mohrenschildt's suicide, divorce of Jim and Liz Garrison in 1978, etc. There is a director commentary option as well that is interesting.  The collector's edition sound is good quality, but use of rear channels does seem limited. I have the VHS and there is more of a surround effect on it! Picture quality is excellent, and highlights the use of the light coloring at the beginning and color increases as we are taken to 3 years after assassination(notice how the color changes during the beginning of scene with Senator Long(Matthau) and Garrison), and Stone explains why this was done on the commentary disk. The b-Disk includes an interview with Col. Fletcher Prouty.</p></body></html>

I always have to wonder when I start rooting for the "Badguy" in any movie.  Right after Viki gives her last memorable speech of how the human race is run by self interest, self involvment and self everything (which is primarily true), they decide to shut her down and kill her because the truth hurts.  My main question in this movie was, who's the good guy and who's the bad guy?  By the end of the movie, I wanted Will Smith's character dead and his little counter part's character to suffer too.  Not that the robots were anything to cheer about either.  Their faces were enough to punch, and their pompous laid back attitude is what's wrong with humanity in the first place.  I was more intrigued with the first stage robots.  They had kind faces and hearts of gold.  A big problem I had with this movie was the miscasting of Will Smiths character and the fact it ripped alot of the premise of the film off "Blade Runner".  I was impressed with the awesome special effects, it's just a shame the story didn't live up to the visuals.</p></body></html>

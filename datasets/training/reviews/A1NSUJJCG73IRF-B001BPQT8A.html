<meta name="summary" content="Seven  (1995)"></head><body><p>Director:  David Fincher<br />Cast:  Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, John C. McGinley, Kevin Spacey.<br />Running Time:  127 minutes.<br />Rated R for extreme violence, gore, and language.<p>One of the most gruesome, yet intriguing mystery/suspense thrillers of the past decade, "Seven" is widely considered one of the best of its kind-and rightfully so.  It is a film that will test the stomachs of all its viewers, yet even those who feel queasy throughout the entire picture stay engaged because of the impeccable acting, top-notch direction, and riveting cinematography.<p>Detective William Somerset (a stupendous, touching performance from the always admirable Morgan Freeman) is looking forward to retirement-he has had it with all the horror, stress, and dead partners that accompany his job.  His young prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Detective Mills (Brad Pitt), is looking forward to follow in his footsteps, but realizes that his feet are in too deep as a serial killer who calls himself "John Doe" begins to parade around the city-killing each of his victims in a pattern that references to the seven deadly sins.  As both detectives uncover more of the truth about the horrific killer, they become entangled in a ghoulish scheme that will shock them.  Gwyneth Paltrow gives a fine performance as Mills's distressed wife.<p>Director David Fincher creates a dark and disturbing film, using Freeman and Pitt well (both give slightly dark, somber performances) to his advantage.  The unique camera angles, explosive chase sequences, and vivid crime scenes enhance the picture, making "Seven" an inimitable thriller that is so effective, powerful, and alarming that it will scare your socks right off.  The finale is one of the most electrifying of all time, pitting Pitt (no pun intended) against the evil murderer in an emotional, unforgettable showdown.  A rare cinematic experience that will make you have nightmares for weeks-but enjoy every second of it.  The Platinum Series DVD is phenomenal, which includes many deleted scenes, alternate endings, and a DVD-rom exclusive that allows you to look into the killer's mind.  A captivating, spellbinding look at how the horrors of society can simply drive an ordinary man mad.</p></body></html>

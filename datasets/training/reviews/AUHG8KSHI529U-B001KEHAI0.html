<meta name="summary" content="I enjoy everyone in the cast and every scene is a delight"></head><body><p>One of my favorite multiple-watching films.  I don't even want to argue whether the film is important or not, great or not, or whatever or not.  It is a fun film with a pleasant love story and is full of actors I really enjoy watching.  The love story is fun because it is the mirror of the normal film love story.  Typically the girl hates the guy but she slowly changes to see what a great guy he is and finally falls for him.  Here, Rita (Andie MacDowell - in one of my favorite of her performances) remains the same and it is Phil (Bill Murray - one of his great roles) who slowly learns who he needs to be to win Rita over and finally becomes that person.<br /><br />While everyone knows the plot of the story by now, I don't want to give it away to the three people left who don't know it.  Just let me say that unless you think funny movies cannot have a kind soul, you will like this movie.  Frankly, I get awfully tired of the oceans of howling venom passing for wit.  This is a movie I am willing to watch anytime at the drop of a hat.  There are so many funny scenes, but the image of Bill Murray giving driving instructions to a groundhog as the flee from panicked townsfolk is wonderful.<br /><br />Enjoy it!</p></body></html>

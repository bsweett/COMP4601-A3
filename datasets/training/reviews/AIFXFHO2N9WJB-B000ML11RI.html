<meta name="summary" content="This Movie Is Sinfully Twisted & Pointless..."></head><body><p>I have to admit I have never read a Sin City comic, I am a comic book fan but that is one series I've never been all that interested in reading.  When I heard about the movie being made I figured I'd see the movie and if I liked it enough then I would read the comics.  Well, let me say this if the movie is any indication of the comics, then as far as the comics go, no thanks I'll pass.<br /><br />"Sin City" follows three different storylines that really don't have much to do with each other.  One storyline focuses on an old near-retirement cop named Hartigan (Bruce Willis) who is trying to save a young woman named Nancy (Jessica Alba), who as an 11 year old he saved from the same man that is trying to rape and kill her now.  The second storyline focuses on Marv (an unrecognizable Mickey Rourke) who after spending the night with a girl who winds up dead the next morning, goes on a rampage to find out who killed her and why.  Third, is the story of Dwight (a very wooden Clive Owen), a shady man with a mysterious past who now spends his time trying to save his new girlfriend from a crooked cop/ex-boyfriend.<br /><br />All of the storylines work decently on their own, but really don't belong in the same movie together.  Other films have used the format of having separate storylines that intertwine with one another with great success, "Traffic" would be a prime example, but "Sin City" is not one of these films.  Supposedly each of the three storylines had much more footage that was filmed and edited down for time constraints.  Now if a director's cut appears and the storylines get fleshed out then maybe this would be a somewhat better movie.  Even if that happens there are still several things wrong with this movie, the script is very clunky and sounds as if it came right off the pages of a comic book.  Some things just sound better when you're reading them in a comic and not using them to tell a story within a movie.  Another problem would be the acting, it was way too wooden from almost every actor.  I presume this is how director's Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller wanted it, though the reason eludes me.<br /><br />On to some positive notes, there was some humor in the movie that helped lift certain moments in the film.  Another positive for the movie is the special effects, since the movie was filmed entirely in front of a green screen the CGI backgrounds were flawlessly mixed with the actors, unlike the terrible "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" that attempted the same trick.<br /><br />All gripes aside, "Sin City" is an alright movie, and I'm sure it stays incredibly faithful to the source material and for that I respect what has been created, but the movie as a whole, just didn't light my fire.  If you are a fan of the Sin City comics then I'm sure you will love this movie, but you will probably be left wanting to see the separate storylines fleshed out a bit more.<br /><br />"Sin City" is rated R for violence, language, and nudity/sexuality.</p></body></html>

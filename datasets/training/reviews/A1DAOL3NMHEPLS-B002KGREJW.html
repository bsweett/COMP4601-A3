There are a number of funny bits, but overall the movie is closer to a tragedy than a comedy.  The Hoovers are not a happy family, their road trip is marred by death, and Olive does not triumph at the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. Abigail Breslin is perfect in the title role, and many of the adult actors' performances are quite funny; Alan Arkin is particularly good. But overall, the movie misfires almost as often as it succeeds.  As I watched, I couldn't help but think how much better it would have been if the "Seinfeld" cast had performed it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="widely considered the scariest movies of all time"></head><body><p>its a bit slow in parts i think.a little girl gets posessed by a demon and a priest comes to try and exorcise it.it looks all low budget.theres a few versions.i think this one is best.its pretty intense,many people get scared off.the very fact that a little girl is the victim is pretty lewd i think.its supposed to be true but somehow i doubt it.its very psycologicly tormenting.theres the girls mom whose no spring chicken and a little girl,so the chick element is non-existant!the demon acts as the clerics assistants mom and really messes with his head.the important message is,dont mess with demons,but if you must,be prepared!the entire movie is extremely intense!the special effects blow.every so often they redo this movie.theres been 3 so far so maybe by 2015 0r so there will be another one.</p></body></html>

The whole purpose of the boring Village was to try to throw you a tweest, but it did not prepare me for the cinematic train-wreck that is Lady in the Water.<br /><br />In the opening scene we see M. Night flaunting his camera style where we see a bunch of people reacting to Paul Giammati squashing some bug, ok so they can act, let's see them act out a fairy tale pinched out of M. Night himself. So Paul Giammati's the maintainence guy of this apartment complex that's main/only attraction seems to be this gigantic pool in the middle, where he finds some nymph who claims she's from the 'blue world' or some dumb crap like that.<br /><br />Eventually she meets all of the apartment residents and finds M. Night Shymalan playing himself in his most humble role yet: the savior of mankind through his stories. The story is so stupid and jumbled that I got the impression that Dingdong made up the story as it went along, and speaking of which the lady is named 'Story', I can just picture Shyamalan thinking "this is genius, like me" to himself when he thought that dumb name up. 'Stor-f*** this I'm calling her lady' is apparently motivating, she convinces Giammati not to kill himself and reveals the other tenants true purpose, but all you really see her do is hug her knees in the shower and stared blankly, wow real motivating.<br /><br />So later when the characters are going on their adventure trying to figure out who's role is who (instead of working like normal people) they get a film critic to help, and he ends up screwing it up because he thinks he knows how to choose the roles by movies. Oh yeah, and one person dies in this movie, guess who? That's right, the wormy, snobby critic who hates everything, just like in real life! That's right Shymalan, keep rubbing your, *ehem* 'ego' while writing this self-congratulatory s***. When the critic is confronted by a monster he says to himself "I'm going to narrowly escape, almost getting killed but not quite", then BAM! He dies! TAKE THAT CRITICS, YOU THINK MY MOVIES ARE S***, I'LL WIPE OUT A PLANET-LOAD OF CRITICS IF YOU DON'T STOP CRITICIZING MY MOVIES! OH GOD I'M CUMM-anyways no one seems to care that the critic has died, and they're all going through some weird impromptu formula for the lady to get picked up by a giant eagle (lord of the rings anyone? oh wait, it's name was Eagatron or whatever so I guess it's suddenly original).<br /><br />M. Night Shyamalan's character is an amazing brilliant writer that's way ahead of his time apparently. He's going to write a novel that will one day inspire peace and end war, however his book is controversial and leads up to him inevitably getting assassinated, and he knows this and writes the book anyways. Wow, now DingDong is drawing comparisons of himself to Christ, never in the history of movies have I seen such an egotistical little man write himself as the voice of God, I think at the end of the initial screening only one person was still in the theater standing in applause, M. Night Shyamalan of course. Maybe one day we can all come to recognize his genius, because his scripts are definately going to change the world one day, just look at the Happening's brilliant script of killer plants.</p></body></html>

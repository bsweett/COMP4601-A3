Rated:  *(****)"></head><body><p>I agree with any of a number of previous reviewers: Would somebody PLEASE take STAR WARS away from George Lucas before he ruins it completely?<br /><br />Like Francis Ford Coppola, who messed with THE GODFATHER trilogy over and over again trying to "perfect" it, Lucas keeps coming back to the original STAR WARS trilogy and adding enhanced effects and formerly deleted scenes.<br /><br />In what is now known as STAR WARS EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE, (let me catch my breath a minute, please), Lucas decided to add creatures to the Mos Eiseley spaceport scene, alter the classic cantina scene, throw in a scene between Jabba the Hutt and Han Solo in the hangar of the "Millennium Falcon," add a sappy reunion scene between Biggs and Luke just before the Battle of Yavin, make the battle scene explosions more "dramatic," do a score of other little tweaks, and clean up the print.<br /><br />Lucas has done this so many times over the past three decades that it's now impossible to figure out which film is the "real" STAR WARS. Of all the questionable "improvements" he's made, cleaning up the print is the only worthwhile effort. Most of the added scenes add nothing to the film, the "extra" creatures are interesting but unnecessary, and some of the changes  actually degrade the movie, because the dialogue is repetitious. For example:<br /><br />IN THE CANTINA:<br /><br />Greedo---Jabba has no use for smugglers who dump their cargoes at the first sign of an Imperial ship.<br /><br />Han---Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice?<br /><br />and<br /><br />IN THE HANGAR:<br /><br />Jabba--- I have no use for smugglers who dump their cargoes at the first sign of an Imperial ship.<br /><br />Han---Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice?<br /><br />Not only was it repetitious, but the hangar scene immediately followed the cantina scene, making the repetition even more obvious. DEAR LORD, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING, MR. LUCAS??????<br /><br />Fortunately, this two-disc set contains the original theatrical release with all the nicks and imperfections it was born with. The print's a bit dim, and the special effects are showing their limitations after thirty years, but this is the STAR WARS that will remain STAR WARS. It is what it is, and it never needed changes. Given the immense amount of material that has grown up around STAR WARS since it was first released, Lucas would have been smarter to release one or the other or both versions as he did, but added an Extras disc with all kinds of "The Making Of.." and "The Legacy Of..." goodies. I was disappointed that this isn't that set.<br /><br />I was one of the first people to see STAR WARS when it debuted in the summer of 1977. At age 17, this now-classic movie became and remains a benchmark of an era in my life. While I never became a "Jedihead" (the original tag for the STAR WARS version of a Trekkie), I liked the film a great deal.<br /><br />STAR WARS is not CITIZEN KANE IN OUTER SPACE. It's not a "great" film, but it is a true "classic." At the end of the first film you might even wonder what all the hype was about. Yet the movie has a engaging and endearing quality that makes you want to keep coming back for more, the true basis of success and the core of meaningfulness for any story. STAR WARS is clearly derivative. THE LORD OF THE RINGS has a "Dark Lord." STAR WARS has a "Dark Lord of the Sith." Lightsabers are yet another nod to the film's Sword & Sorcery roots, as is the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi (a little Gandalf, anyone?). STAR WARS' "Corellians" appear in Isaac Asimov's FOUNDATION as "Korellians", and "Han Solo" is also there as "Hari Seldon." The space war elements are a mishmash of STAR TREK, FORBIDDEN PLANET, AMAZING STORIES, pulp fiction, and a hundred other sources. George Lucas was able to take these well-used pieces and combine them into something that is both very original and yet archetypal.<br /><br />STAR WARS is a sci-fi retelling of the Mythos of the young Hero. Aided by a mentor (Obi-Wan), an older, more seasoned companion (Han), and his own court jesters (See Threepio and Artoo Detoo), the young Hero (Luke) is introduced to his special (Jedi) birthright, saves the beautiful Princess (Leia) from the clutches of Evil (Darth Vader), and then must confront that Evil himself (the Battle of Yavin).<br /><br />Since STAR WARS is so mythic and archetypal, it survives some really bad acting by the background characters, a few missed beats here and there, and even Lucas's post-theatrical obsessive-compulsive changes to remain a modern classic.<br /><br />FIVE STARS FOR "STAR WARS", ONE STAR FOR LUCAS' DECISION (OBSESSION?) TO "IMPROVE" IT.</p></body></html>

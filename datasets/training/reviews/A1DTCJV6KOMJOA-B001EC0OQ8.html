<meta name="summary" content="Harder Hitting Than a Lead Armed Man With a Black Jack!"></head><body><p>This film is one of those flicks that just starts everything else in its genre but still after numerous films copy it it ransk as the best! Maltese Falcon gives of four big things; amazing dialogue, Humphrey Bogart, great cinemtography, and unseen violence! The plot follows a swine after swin as they search for a jewel encrusted falcon the only hitch is that somewhere along the line the falcon was misplaced. Bogart wants to know who has it and why everyone wants it! The dialogue is the saving grace of the film overlapping and delivered faster than a pizza! Smacks and gunshots are thrown all around the screen and Houston's direction catches every bit of it. Houston paints such a clear vision that the camera tends not to so much follow the scenes but move them along. houston constatnly pans off to follow and actor befor they even move making for a sense of rushed urgency and moving the film at break neck speeds. Bogart is offering his tough guy persona that he will later use to the utmost but here its raw, new and powerful. Mary Astor as the film's ice queen is brilliant. Never reaching the fame she deserved her off easy looks and washed out expressionsa nd stabbing tone of voice are just stunning and adds an extra element of danger. The film uses the &quot;invisible gun technique&quot;; of when you believe the film's &quot;main&quot; character is just off screen and will come into the plot to give the film another level of over the top depth but it never happens but its in the illusion of this character that gives the flick an omnipresent feel. Films of this stature are not even being produced anymore because this level of talent is no longer around.</p></body></html>

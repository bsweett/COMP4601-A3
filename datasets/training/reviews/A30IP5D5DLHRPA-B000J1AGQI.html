<meta name="summary" content="Excellent movie in almost all aspects."></head><body><p>As a son of a Vietnam Vet, I get the luxury of getting feedback on how realistic war movies really are.  When he took me to go see We Were Soldiers, his first comments was on the terrain.  He said it looked as though it was filmed in California.  But that was the only fault we found.  The combat sequences were excellent and truely realistic, you really had to make sure you own Hueys and planes did NOT shoot at you instead of the enemy.  <p>The helicopter crash was the most realistic one I've seen yet in a war movie where when they crash they don't erupt in a ball of flame but the emmit severl bursts or sparks and the props spin off, the Hueys don't just explode and this was something which the producers worked really hard on and we could tell. <p>And the NVA and the Viet Cong really did send their troops out as if they were nothing more then dust.  The mentality was there would always be more troops and that was another really good point the movie made.  All in all, a great movie!</p></body></html>

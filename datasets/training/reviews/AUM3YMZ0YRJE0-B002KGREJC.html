<meta name="summary" content="an excellent kid's view of a very adult experience with consequences"></head><body><p>It was weird to watch this with my daughter, who is just about the age of the girl in this film.  What is so wonderful about the film is that it truly gets to the essence of how a child would experience a pregnancy that was a mistake.  On the verge of getting an abortion, she decides to have the child and finds a local family for it.  Then she goes on with her life, muddling through like so many high school students.  It is believable, moving, funny, disturbing, and uplifting, a wonderful stimulus to dialogue between generations.  The ending is a little la-di-dah with newfound love, there are perhaps not enough emotional consequences - but that might be the point, when she and her boyfriend do not even want to see the baby - but it is genuinely beautiful in its own way.  The acting is absolutely superb, with all the pain and confusion of adolescents dealing (or not) with adult issues.<br /><br />REcommended warmly.</p></body></html>

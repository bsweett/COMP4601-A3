They never get the eyes right.""></head><body><p>In 1944,a band of spirtually dark men and women joined forces with Hitler's quest for world domination. Girgory Rasputin, supposedly dead, helped in creating a machine and activating a portal to the dark world to unleash the seven deomns of chaos. After being foiled and dissapearing from sight, the machine did, however, let one thing through it's open mouth before being destoryed. A creature with bright red skin, a stubby tale, two little horns on it's forehead, and a right hand encrusted in stone. Along with the american soldiers professor broom took care of the infant named HELLBOY.<br /><br />Later on, we are shown that HELLBOY is grown up but barely aged twenty years. 60 years have passed and he's been riding the world of nightmare creatures ever since. That is, until, one day, Rasputin makes an appearence. But HELLBOY isn't as helpless as when he was an infant. He's got a load of new friends. John meyers, a promising second in comand agent. Elizabeth Shermen, A talented Pyro who can consume her whole body in flames and loves taking pictures. And, last but not least, Abraham Sapien, a Fish-like creature that lives to read four books at a time, eat rotten eggs and research more paranormal material.<br /><br />Together, they make a band of freak outcasts whose sole purpose is to rid the world of more people like them but who have turned to evil.<br /><br />Aside from fighting crime, Hellboy has a nagging goal to fit in. He files down his horns to 'fit in' and he also smokes big fat cigars and believes in christianity.<br /><br />But others are searching for him, waiting for him. Becuase their purpose involves hellboy. And it involves putting the demonic back into the demon.<br /><br />But, along the way, take advantage of seeing the spectacular special effects and the incredibly comic-like settings. It's easy to sympathize with hellboy because he's trying to become a man. And he has to learn it in the same way that all of us learned it . . .except for a few shady characters and unbelieveable circumstances. It truly is a Comic Book adaptation that shows you what it takes to be a man . . .even if you are from somewhere else.<br /><br />Final Verdict: He's big and red and full of wise guy.<br /><br />Enjoy!</p></body></html>

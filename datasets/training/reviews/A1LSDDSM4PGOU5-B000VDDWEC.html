<meta name="summary" content="not a zombie movie,but much more"></head><body><p>28 days later is a well made film.it has good performances from its<br />main actors,it is suspenseful,and there are some scary moments.the<br />director maintains tension throughout the movie.the make up effects in<br />the film are very well done,so that the infected look much less than<br />human,quite horrifying in fact.the action sequences are well done as<br />are the dramatic moments.this a not a zombie movie per Se,but a movie<br />about human relations and interaction in the face of what seems like<br />hopelessness.the most horrifying thing in the movie is its<br />premise,which is: plague has spread throughout the land,infecting<br />people and turning them into animalistic creatures,not quite<br />zombies,but not human either and having no thought other than attacking<br />and infecting the uninfected.it shows the desperation that some people<br />are willing to go through to survive.i won't give away any specifics of<br />the plot.anyway,for me,this is a well crafted movie all around.it is a<br />deep movie with a message and it asks some very scary questions.highly<br />recommended 4/5</p></body></html>

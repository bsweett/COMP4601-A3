It is not what we expect from  a "settling in America" love story. It is  beautifully photographed and, often, well acted. It tells a story fundamental to the myths of America  and tells it well. Yet, it makes no concession to the rhythms of American film-making, the expectations  of an American audience. It is slow, even when events are dramatic, the film is not; better, it is dramatic in a measured way with the drama implicit in the scenery, the walk, the glance. Frankly, I watched it over a period of three days, able to enjoy it only in a series of segments, one at a time. So, judge what kind of viewer you are before ordering this for an evenings  pleasure.</p></body></html>

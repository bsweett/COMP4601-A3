They didn't miss a trick.  Everybody has their own favorite scene in this movie, whether it's the tornado shredding the Hollywood sign in Los Angeles, or hail the size of soccer balls falling on the beach in Malibu, or the rainfall guysering up through the manholes in Manhattan... my own favorite is the giant wave about to engulf the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor and getting ready to flood out all of the Lower East Side and midtown. The first hour of this film is a special effects fanatic's delight.<br /><br />And a good thing, too, because once the special effects are done, what's left of the movie falls flatter than the proverbial pancake. Alas, Roland Emmerich never realized that great special effects do not a great movie make. Once the deep freeze outside is on, the movie freezes up as well. We've heard it all before -- the lone, unregarded scientist, preaching doom and gloom, ignored until too late; his super-bright, nerdy kid who solves complicated calculus problems in his head, competing for the cute coed against the rich kid from the Ivies... is there a cliche that Emmerich forgot to add to this film? Well, the general plot line is interesting, if not altogether original -- global warming leading to a global deep freeze, although this time the deep freeze happens in days, not centuries (there's progress for ya!), but the "human interest" side plots add absolutely nothing to the script and are at best a big yawn and at worst just plain irritating. The acting is adequate, but just barely. The rain, snow and hail have more personality than the actors.<br /><br />If Emmerich thought he was giving us a deep film that would sound a global alarm on the dangers of global warming, he's too full of himself to be taken seriously. As if anyone would take this movie seriously. It's a fun movie, and taken as such, it's a fun way to spend a couple of hours in front of the TV. Kick back with a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy.</p></body></html>

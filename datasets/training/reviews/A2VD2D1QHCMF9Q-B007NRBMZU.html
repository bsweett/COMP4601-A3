Not very profound . . . obviously, changing the past will change the future.  But for the Butterfly Effect to be true to its name, many other things would change too, which doesn't happen.  The film is "politically correct" covering a rainbow of situations . . . in having lead characters in prison, dead, happily married, as a paraplegic, as students, in a mental ward, with incurable cancer, in a porno movie, a drug-crazed hooker, and so on.  What's left out?  This is a simple minded film which makes very little sense and it would be better to have passed it by.</p></body></html>

Consequently, I watched this story unfold without any preconceptions whatsoever and was able to get into the flow of the movie to the point that when Penn's Jimmy Markum declares that he knows that he had a hand in the twists of fate that led to the murder of his 19-year old daughter, Katie (Emmy Rossum), I knew that this was a pivotal line in the film and a key to unraveling the mystery.<p>&quot;Mystic River&quot; begins with a past that is prologue.  The only real clue is that Luis Tiant is the Boston Red Sox pitcher under discussion by the guys on the front porch.  Three young boys are interrupted while writing their names in drying cement by evil wearing a false face of authority.  We learn enough of the details to understand how all three boys are scarred, in different ways, and that when circumstances bring them together a couple of decades later, what happened way back when is a material part of their present realities when Jimmy's world is shattered by his daughter's violent murder.  <p>Beyond that I am not inclined to get into much more detail regarding the plot.  The script by Brian Helgeland, adapted from the novel by Dennis Lehane, does a good job of laying out the clues and false leads.  I found that I was just far ahead enough of the dual investigations, one by the cops Jimmy (Kevin Bacon) and Whitey (Laurence Fishburne), the other by local thugs Val (Kevin Chapman) and Nick Savage (Adam Nelson), to know they were getting closer but not putting the pieces together the right way.  However, even though I know that telling such a story in a world where modern forensics turns a pint of blood in the trunk of a car into a mountain of damning evidence, the holes in the story's logic did not prove a distraction and my only serious comment would be that I would have changed the motive of the murder to conform better with Jimmy's self-incriminating epiphany.  The film plays fair with the audience and ultimately it is the characters that captivate us. <p>It is only November but it is not too early to talk about Eastwood and this film getting nominated for Academy Awards.  Sean Penn is almost certainly going to get an Oscar nomination for his performance and I would expect the same for the eerily sedate Tim Robbins, although I suspect it will be in the Supporting Actor category.  But the performances of the entire cast are outstanding and it is easy to believe that these people all grew up in this neighborhood and are indeed feeling the pains that force them to make the life altering decisions they do in the course of this film.  The film's tagline--&quot;We bury out sins, we wash them clean&quot;--is not paraphrased until the climax, but we recognize the truth of that idea long before that point.<br /><br />This is also a film that successfully hints at the depth of the novel, no more so when Jimmy's second wife, Annabeth (Laura Linney) delivers what is essentially the films benediction and provides a new perspective on the events that have transpired, putting them rather unexpectedly on a larger level.  As I turn over this film in my mind my final question is whether &quot;Mystic River&quot; is more akin to a Shakespearean tragedy or an ancient Greek tragedy.  Either way, Clint Eastwood has presented a film that tells of tragedy on a grand scale even if it is played out in a small corner of South Boston.</p></body></html>

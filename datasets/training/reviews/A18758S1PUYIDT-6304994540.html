<meta name="summary" content="Pretty good; would be better with some tweaking"></head><body><p>Perhaps it's just an editor's/writer's fantasy....I would have removed the characters of Jesus (completely unnecessary) and Delphino (ditto).  I also would have made somewhat more of a coherent narrative, although I might concede the necessity of absurdist scenes like 'Gutterballs.'<br /><br />There's plenty to like, though:  the chameleon actor Jeff Bridges, a native of L.A., is perfectly suited to the role of the Dude; the Stranger is not totally necessary, either, but he is wonderful; Steve Buscemi and John Goodman are hilarious, especially the latter, with his constant refrains about Vietnam; and then there are the usual hijinks and screw-ups related to kidnapping and other crimes for which the Coen Brothers seem to have a very strong affinity.</p></body></html>

This movie is rather short compared with the earlier two movies.  It concluded at a mere 1 hour 24 minutes.  The tirade old jokes seemed to be running out of puff.  Whereas in the earlier offerings, we would be laughing our heads' off, in this instance, we might chuckle here & there.  There were many unexpected delightful cameo appearances & you could have mistaken the opening sequence to a John Woo's action movie.  I guess it's the charisma of Mike Myers that carried the whole movie.  The supporting cast was stunning particularly Michael Caine who showed his depth & versatility in acting.  I always fancied Roach's direction as his light-hearted & casual approach seemed to motivate the cast to improvise in their actings.  We have seen all the jokes & gags before.  Otherwise, this movie would be a blast.  I'm not surprised that this is the grand finale of this trilogy.  This DVD package is great as it offered many deleted scenes (on the hindsight, those scenes really don't add anything to the movie), documentaries about the production team, cast, choreography team, stunt team, vehicles sourcing team, special effects team, commentaries from Mike Myers, Director, Producer.  Even though this movie is mediocre, it's still a worthwhile movie to watch for a laugh.</p></body></html>

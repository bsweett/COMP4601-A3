<meta name="summary" content="BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE"></head><body><p>Actually give this one 4 1/2 stars.  Much closer to the spirit of the comics than the first movie.  General Stryker hates mutants even though his son is one.  He has a beef with Professor X and his school and begins his hunt against the mutants.<p>Not only that, but Stryker knows Wolverine from the past and while not going into detail, it's clear he was the one who gave Wolverine is adamantite claws and bone augmentation as a weapon.  Again, staying somewhat true to his Weapon X origins.<p>Several new X-men are along for the ride, most notably the spectacular Nightcrawler who has a fantastic sequence where he teleports through the Whitehouse taking out guards in order to kill the president.  <p>We also see Bobby Drake as Iceman, Pyro, and a short cameo with the armor skinned Colossus as a student in the school.  <p>Also back is Ian McKellan as Magneto and Rebecca Romijn Stamos as Mystique,who joins forces with the X-men to fight Stryker and his troops.<p>Much better story than the first movie and more exciting.  Wolverine, Iceman, and Nightcrawler get the bulk of the character development at the expense of Cyclops and Rogue who have rather minimal roles in the movie.<p>The DVD is loaded with many extras and multiple commentaries.  One of the best DVDs of 2003.</p></body></html>

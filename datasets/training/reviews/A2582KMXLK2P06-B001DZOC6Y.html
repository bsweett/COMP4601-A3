I guess people didn't like the storyline, which mainly focused on a young couple running away from these poisonous plants that released a chemical making people kill themselves (in graphic ways in a few spots).<br /><br />No, don't worry, it's not what you're probably thinking- you don't actually SEE the plants turn violent with silly special effects and chase after people or anything like that- it's just that, whenever the wind would blow, people had to run for their lives.  Much of the storyline focused on the outside, especially the fields, while people were walking through them and trying to find a place to hide.  The kind of people the young couple met along the way brought a lot of entertainment to the story.<br /><br />And, SURPRISE, I happen to live in one of the areas where the plot was focused on, haha.  I guess I better start being nice to the plants around me then.<br /><br />As I mentioned above, having plants release something that would cause people to kill themselves leaves the door open for a lot of possibilities as far as storyline direction and creativity goes, and the Happening took advantage of this BIG time with lots of incredibly shocking scenes involving suicide and people showing no concern for their own lives because the toxin from the plants was controlling them, and in a way the people on the verge of suicide moved around like zombies.<br /><br />This movie did every single thing right to me- had a LOT of suspense, had a storyline that was easy to follow yet interesting enough to keep you guessing what would happen next, and the main characters were pretty good too (especially the guy).  I seriously don't get all the negativity for this movie because it was honestly good enough for me to rate it pretty highly and recommend it to others who might be interested in watching it.</p></body></html>

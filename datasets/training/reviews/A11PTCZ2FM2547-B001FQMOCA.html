The only time I got a kick out of his music was in the late Sixties (or early Seventies?), when he released his tongue-in-cheek hit, "Boy Named Sue."  Very entertaining, in case you haven't heard it.  Otherwise, I paid scant attention to the Man in Black, other than knowing he sang about trains, and crime, and prison, and that he was a tad rambunctious.<br /><br />So when WALK THE LINE initially came out, my interest wasn't all that keen on learning about the troubled life of Cash (or his equally tumultuous romance with June Carter).  Two words got me to go see the film during its theatrical run--and to watch this exceptional movie several times since:  Joaquin Phoenix.  I'm a big fan of this remarkable, versatile actor, have been ever since seeing him in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009ZYBY">Gladiator</a>.  And in Cash's biopic Phoenix doesn't disappoint:  he immerses himself in the character, becomes the troubled Man in Black--right down to the singer's deep baritone.  Equally impressive is Reese Witherspoon as the ever-aloof June Carter (ultimately June Carter Cash); Witherspoon is dead on, from June's feisty sassiness, to her twang and drawl.<br /><br />It's one thing not to appreciate the actual music--it's quite another to be blown away when two actors absolutely nail the actual music.  That's what makes WALK THE LINE such a great film:  it's completely, unequivocally, believable.  Further kudos go out to Robert Patrick, who plays Cash's forever-disapproving father (the Denethor of the Ozarks).  So don't let not being a fan of Johnny Cash keep you from seeing this film; if you haven't checked out WALK THE LINE, by all means do so.  And get rhythm, when you get the blues.<br />--D.

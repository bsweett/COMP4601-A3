<meta name="summary" content="Cute, classic movie. 3.75 stars."></head><body><p>This movie has a lot of charm, but sometimes it's a little boring.<br /><br />Snow White is cute and all. And she has an alright personality. But I feel this movie lacks some of the perfection that other titles such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JBWWRY">Peter Pan (2-Disc Platinum Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXB4">The Lion King (Disney Special Platinum Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F8O35U">The Little Mermaid (Two-Disc Platinum Edition)</a> had.<br /><br />The animals add a lot to the overall innocent feel to the movie. And like I said, Snow White has the perfect, girl-next-door personality.<br /><br />I'm sure I was watching the restored version, but from what I did see, the movie has aged really well considering it was from 1937. That was 72+ years ago!<br /><br />I really enjoyed watching them all dance with Snow White. It was cute.<br /><br />All in all, a good movie for kids and some adults to enjoy. Grumpy's comments and Dopey's actions were the funniest.<br /><br />3.75 stars or a 7.5/10.</p></body></html>

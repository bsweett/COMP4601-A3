<meta name="summary" content="Missing the Magic Word"></head><body><p>This film has a good premise unfortunately it never seemed to fulfill it or to offer anything other than another Hollywood view of relationships.  This is really unfortunate because this could have been a good film with a variety of messages, instead it simply describes in ever increasing painful detail a failing relationship.  This is not surprising because the film at its core describes two self-absorbed individuals who are committed to only two things -- winning and keeping their condo. There is no real committment to each other or to the relationship, which they constantly talk about but never do anything to repair it or to show they really care about the other person.  The focus is on winning and when Vaughn finally capitulates Anniston walks away -- having won a pyrhic victory.  Thus the moment for the magic word "marriage" comes and goes because this isn't about real love or committment to each other, it is all about ME.  The film portrays the modern view of "relationships" which essentially means being "friends with benefits".  These modern living arrangements are popular but bear no resemblance to either committment or marriage but this point is totally ignored in this film.  These are two people who have a lot of fun together and form a sexual and financial relationhsip but when the downside comes --after several years of fun and frolic -- it collapses -- like so many do in real life -- into a contest of wills.  It becomes very obvious that there was never any committment to each other at a personal level, which I presume is why there was no marriage -- just pseudo-adults playing house.<br /><br />This film had many opportunities to explore marriage versus relationships, it could have contrasted love and passion, it could have shown that true love is about sacrifice, but none of this was present or even attempted.  It was simply a drawn out contest of wills.  In essence it was simply the war of the roses lite --i.e. no violence.  I gave it two stars solely because the final symbolic scene showing them turning their backs on each other and going their separate ways was well done. This was a sad film that had no point, no message, no love, and no marriage.  I wouldn't recommend buying or even renting this film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Impressive debut by Eminem is a mildly flawed film"></head><body><p>I was extremely impressed with Eminem's screen debut, all the more so in that I am not at all a fan of rap.  Unlike many other musical performers who try their hand at acting, Eminem is a natural in front of the camera, never coming across like an actor wannabe, never having dreadful moments in the film like one finds in similar efforts by Mariah Carey or Madonna.  Moreover, the world in which Rabbit, the rapper Eminem portrays, lives is portrayed vividly and convincingly.  It is a bleak, unpleasant, unforgiving world that offers little in the way of a future.  <p>It is not a perfect film.  Some of the characters struck me more as caricatures, like Kim Basinger's portrayal of Rabbit's mother.  The mixture of friends wasn't completely convincing.  Brittany Murphy's character is so vague as to be indecipherable.  But despite the holes, the movie at its core is powerful and convincing.<p>The central event of the film is the &quot;battle&quot; of rappers near the end.  At this point the movie feels more like a Western than anything, with young pretender to the crown of &quot;Fastest Gun in Town&quot; taking on and vanquishing all comers.  These are among the best scenes in the film.<p>But in the end, many crucial issues are left untouched.  One of the central dilemmas and contradictions of Eminem's career is his being white but having excelled in an overwhelmingly black musical genre.  This crucial issue in Eminem's career was not addressed as explicitly in 8 MILE as I would have liked.  It is referred to, but for the most part Rabbit's presence on the rap scene is accepted more than discussed.  The central question of why a white kid would become a rapper is in the end not mentioned at all.  Why did Rabbit cross over to a black musical genre?  Interestingly, at one point in the film a movie is playing on TV.  I recognized it as Douglas Sirk's IMITATION OF LIFE, a 1959 film in which a beautiful, light-skinned black girl passes for white, only to meet tragedy when the white kids discover she is black.  Clearly this is intended to hint at the danger Rabbit is encountering in crossing racial boundaries, but it still doesn't answer the question of why he wanted to cross over to begin with.  Why rap instead of punk?  Why hip hop instead of a predominantly white form of music?  None of this is dealt with, but it remains the central unresolved issue in the film.</p></body></html>

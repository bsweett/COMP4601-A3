<meta name="summary" content="This is the way LOST should be seen!"></head><body><p>The good news is that this is a FANTASTIC DVD set of a superb show.  The bad news is that it will spoil you from wanting to sit through new episodes, one week at a time with commercial breaks.<br /><br />Everything about this show works...the cast, their performances, cinematography, soundtrack, plot devices, EVERYTHING!  Skill and serendipity come together in a perfect mixture.  Having the ability to watch multiple episodes in one sitting greatly enhances the LOST experience.  Unfortunately, having to wait for new episodes on TV each week results in forgetting certain nuances or plot points that are so integral to the fun and mystery of the overall show.<br /><br />Great special features on Disc 7 (the entire product is as thoughtfully and beautifully produced as the series itself).  If only all series were given the care, backing and attention of this one, the world of network television would be elevated to a much higher level.<br /><br />My only pet peeve is that most (NOT ALL! There are definite exceptions...) of the commentary tracks feature participation from multiple actors/producers that essentially turn into a joke fest of insider's humor or recollections that do little to enhance the "behind the scenes" information.  It would have been better to limit these commentaries to one or two participants at a time and have them addressing the home viewer rather than each other.<br /><br />LOST Season One has set a very high bar and I hope they'll keep it up for all the seasons to follow.  I'll look forward to getting the next DVD collection as well, for this is far superior to watching it first-run on Wednesday nights.  A definite set for your collection and a bargain at the amazon price.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="What was Berry thinking?"></head><body><p>I'll cover the good points first. Halle Berry did a good job considering the material she had to work with. Why she chose this role, I am not sure. Maybe she knew she would look really good in leather. Pratt was okay considering it wasn't much of a role. He was basically a boy toy (or cat toy?) Stone had a horrible role so I'm will not comment on her acting in this movie. How can you act when you are suppose to have a stone face?<br /><br />The bad points are plentiful. The plot was unbelievable. The dialogue was horrendous. The CGI was unconvincing. The characters were silly. The mythology was laughable. At least Spiderman had a good message: "With great power comes great responsibility." Catwoman's message seems to be: "Don't stand in the way of an independent woman." Morality is ambigious. Independance is key. Oprah and Martha would be proud.</p></body></html>

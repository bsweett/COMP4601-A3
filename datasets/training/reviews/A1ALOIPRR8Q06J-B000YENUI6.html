<meta name="summary" content="Cronenberg - one of our best directors."></head><body><p>"I seem to be drawn to enclosed hermetically sealed subcultures whether they're ones that I've invented myself in sci-fi terms or things like M. Butterfly which was the Peking Opera. This is not only Russian culture transplanted to England but mob culture, which is a subculture of a subculture. I think it's my existentialist underpinnings that draw me to that, the idea that we create our own reality through our culture and our art. We create a reality that seems as real as anything else, but in fact, it's quite transitory and is really a projection of our own creative will. And so, too, it is with this crime family and that we discover in EASTERN PROMISES." -David Cronenberg.<br /><br />Fascinating, yes? Well summing up in in couple of sentences the story, a nurse (Watts) stumbles into the world of the Russian mafia in England after taking an interest in a patient that died in her hospital and the patients newly born baby. Things aren't often what they may seem. She means well, but is in over her head. Will good prevail? I wasn't bored for a second and there are a couple of nice surprises.<br /><br />*Great script.<br />*Great cast...<br />*Naomi Watts is wonderful. Also I like her Uncle. He's "old school". Viggo Mortensen is a very talented actor and he delivers an incredible performance as a Russian mobster. One of his finest. Viggo always prepares extensively for his roles, doing in depth research, immersing himself in the part. He actually traveled deep into Russia "a couple of time zones east of Moscow, Saint Petersberg, and the Urals" to a place called Yekaterinburg, located far from Western Europe and that "feels quite different". He met people and would sort of just absorb their "Russianness". If you never saw Viggo in previous roles you'd absolutely believe he is a Russian actor.<br />*DVD contains great bonus material.<br /><br />Like many, I enjoy films that depict the underbelly of society and criminals. I'd have to say "Eastern Promises" is in the top 6-7 films "gangster/mob films" ever made -which is saying a lot. Some believe David Cronenberg to be America's greatest director of recent decades. This film certainly helps make that case. He is surely one of the most interesting.</p></body></html>

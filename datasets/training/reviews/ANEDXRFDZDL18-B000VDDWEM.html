<meta name="summary" content="Meh"></head><body><p>This is the sequel to 28 days later, and I thought it was pretty weak. An entirely predictable plot from start to finish, featuring annoyingly silly teenage protagonists, their dad, and a group of somewhat dim NATO soldiers. I was disappointed because the first film was well done, had an interesting plot and was surprising. This film the children take over with their TSTL (too stupid to live) antics, and the plot devolves into horror/slasher formula. The moment the children arrived in the military zone I predicted they'd do something really moronic. I was disappointed to be right.<br /><br />I enabled close captions, which was convenient when I fast forwarded all the chase scenes that the director apparently considered plot development. This way  I could read the sparse dialog without feeling the need to slow down.<br /><br />The ending was almost the only interesting part of the film. Perhaps a sequel would be better.<br /><br />Overall? I give this one a star. It was barely watchable and boring in its banality.</p></body></html>

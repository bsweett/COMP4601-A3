Nic Cage was decent, but didn't seem to be trying that hard. The CGI was better than the trailers would lead you to believe, but it was nothing I haven't seen done better before. The worst part of the film was the villians and how easy they were defeated. This isn't the worst comic book adaptation, but it deserves a spot somewhere on that list. Wait for the DVD!</p></body></html>

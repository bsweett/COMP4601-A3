<meta name="summary" content="Tooth fairy"></head><body><p>Don't expect a film better than &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; because &quot;Red Dragon&quot; is far from that.  This is the prequel to that film and a replacement for the 1986 film &quot;Manhunter&quot;.<p>&quot;Red Dragon&quot; once again stars Anthony Hopkins as the excellent Hannibal Lector, whom Edward Norton &quot;consults&quot; with to find out more about the Tooth Fairy serial killer.  The Tooth Fairy is played beautifully by Ralph Fiennes. The only problem is, it is a very long time into the film where he does anything frightening.  &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; had multiple suspense moments, whereas Red Dragon really lacks in this department.<p>Overall, I was quite disappointed with &quot;Red Dragon&quot;.  I found Edward Norton very dull, and too long before anything interesting happened.<p>For die-hard fans of the series only.</p></body></html>

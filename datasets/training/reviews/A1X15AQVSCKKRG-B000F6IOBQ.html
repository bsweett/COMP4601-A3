<meta name="summary" content="I loved it and horror fans will love it"></head><body><p>This was a great horror flick. The action was good, Kate<br />Beckinsale was absolutely sizzling on screen, the story<br />is essentially the same and the special effects are great.<br /><br />With movies like "Underworld 2" you don't disect the<br />details about the splot you just watch the action, and blood<br />and enjoy it. Speedman still comes out as stiff but Kate<br />luckily is the main reason the film was made and most<br />fans will not be disappointed. The movie definitely has<br />more gore than the first film put together.<br /><br />It never gets too boring and the action does payoff at<br />the end. I would agree with the others and say to ignore<br />the critics who bashed the movie because quite<br />frankly what were they expecting? Munich? I never<br />understand those movies fans who fork over a money<br />for a movie that they clearly where it's aimed<br />at and still complain later that are dissatisfied.</p></body></html>

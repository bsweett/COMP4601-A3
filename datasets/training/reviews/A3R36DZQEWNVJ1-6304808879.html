<meta name="summary" content="HellRaiser still stands on its own in the Horror Genre"></head><body><p>Andrew Robinson and Clare Higgins move into a British home and Robinson's daughter, played by Ashley Laurence (HellRaiser 2 and 3, Lightning Bug) is also with them.  But Robinson is unaware that his half brother Frank who is Higgin's ex former lover is hiding upstairs in a gletanious skeletal form and he wants Higgins to bring stray men back to him for their blood in order to regain his skin and look the way he was alive. Laurence then winds up in some kind of hospital later on in the movie where she has the puzzle box and discovers for herself some pretty hellish things like PinHead, played by Doug Bradley, and his 3 goonies. Fast, fierce, gruesome fun all the way threw with Clive Barker on the spot, he doesnt destroy this horror classic. Ashley Laurence is scorching hot....even to this day. Word for the wise first time viewers of this movie...if you have a weak stomach...beware...mwahhaha! Dont mind the mwahaha, beware only. Peace out.</p></body></html>

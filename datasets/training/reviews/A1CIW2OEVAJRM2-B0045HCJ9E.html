<meta name="summary" content="Classic cold war espionage story."></head><body><p>Imagine you're a businessman abducted by the Soviets because you're thought to be an American secret agent.  This nightmare is exactly what happens to Manhattan advertising executive Roger Thornhill (acted by Cary Grant).  Once he is mistaken for the spy George Kaplan, the action never lets up.  Thornhill is thoroughly perplexed, and even his mother thinks his story is completely disbelievable: "I think I'd like to meet these killers."  But the Soviets, led by Phillip Vandamm (James Mason), really are killers because they are convinced that Thornhill is about to expose them.  As it turns out, secret agent George Caplan, the man whom the Soviets mistake Thornhill to be, is a fictional creation of the Americans to take the heat off their real secret agent.  And so the Americans are eager to convince Thornhill to continue the charade, life-threatening as it is.  Along the way, Thornhill gets involved with the beautiful Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint).  Or is she a Russian spy herself?  Or perhaps a counter-spy?  It is this combination of romance and intrigue that sets the tone for the rest of the movie.<p>Personally I found the romance rather overdone, particularly the extended and passionate kisses.  Although there is the implied suggestion that the two spend the night together (the trivilization of both casual sex and divorce is a remarkable laxity in morals that was very bold for 1959!), thankfully we are spared any footage more intimate than the kissing.  Thornhill & Kendall's mutual feelings of "love" are pure infatuation based on physical attraction at first sight.  The mention of making love in the first minute of their first conversation is rather absurd and certainly outrageous at the time of production.  Nonetheless, these "offensive" elements are rather tame alongside what most modern movies deliver.  And they are not the focus of attention, since it is really the suspense of the espionage and intrigue that carries the plot and the drama.<p>Of course there are many espionage movies with wonderful suspense.  But Hitchcock's 1959 production delivers suspense without extensive violence, profanity and sex.  The focus is on the suspense and intrigue with numerous plot twists, accompanied throughout by wonderfully dry humor (For instance, Thornhill expressing his reluctance to participate in a charade that could threaten his life: "I have two ex-wives, a mother and several bartenders depending on me!  They would be most disappointed if I got slightly killed.")  There is beautiful scenery and filming throughout - the memorable cinematography of the crop duster attack and the final chase scenes on the faces at Mount Rushmore is superb!  Unlike most modern thrillers, there are times where the action is slow, such as when Thornhill waits alone alongside a desolate road in the middle of nowhere - effectively building up suspense and tension all the more.  As far as cold-war thrillers go, this is a worthy classic of the genre!  Hitchcock serves up delightful humor, spine-tingling suspense, and delightful cinematography, without marring it with much of the moral filth that pollutes contemporary movies.  It's one of the master Hitchcock's best, and is certainly worth a look.</p></body></html>

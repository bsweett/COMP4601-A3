It is sad how unoriginal Hollywood has gotten these days.<br /><br />Because this is a "chick flick" -- there's no doubt about that -- I tried to play it cool and not laugh to hard at the funny bits.  But I have to admit that there were some funny things in this movie, definitely more than I expected.  Zooey Deschanel, Justin Bartha and Terry Bradshaw (yes, the old Steelers quarterback) were dynamite.  Everyone else was good enough to keep the movie afloat.<br /><br />If you're looking for a movie that has romance and comedy, Failure to Launch isn't a bad way to go.  You definitely could do worse.</p></body></html>

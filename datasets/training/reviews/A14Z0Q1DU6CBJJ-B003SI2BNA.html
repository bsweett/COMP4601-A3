But, before watching, you need to realize what you're watching. Because if you're watching it for the proper reason, you may actually really like this. If you're watching it because it's supposed to be scary and scare you... YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. If you're watching it for a neat little ghost story, then you may like it. Because it is.<br /><br />BUT, for the most part, DARK WATER is very slow moving, dark, drab, drudging movie. It has some interesting points to make, but it waits way too long to deliver the goods and doesn't truly capitalize on the moments that should have been scarier then they were.<br /><br />Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly) is a women in a custody battle with her ex-husband for custody of her young daughter Ceci (Ariel Gade). In her attempt to find a suitable home and a place she can afford on a meager budget, she finds an apartment in a rundown apartment building outside of the city. What follows is A LOT of hints and question marks that have you wondering if the apartment building is haunted, or if Dahlia is out of her mind.<br /><br />You may very well find that you love this movie. I mean, it has a great cast. John C. Reilly, Jennifer Connelly, Tim Roth, Dougray Scott & Pete Postlethwaite. They are all fantastic and there's a good story here. Just don't go in expecting a scarefest, because you won't get one.</p></body></html>

I read the novel and was marginally stirred by it, but the cinematic adaptation brought the true horror potential of a giant rogue shark home is a primal way that other films have sought to imitate, but could never duplicate.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg was unarguably the genius behind the execution of the film, but everyone from the excellent cast, to the special effects gurus (remember this was done before digital special effects were even dreamed of), to the editors and sound effects people coalesced to produce an amazing film.<br /><br />I am sure that everyone knows that the film is about a giant rogue shark terrorizing a resort community, and the man-versus-beast battle which ensues, but to me the real genius here is in the development of the lead characters into real, believable people thrust together in a very trying situation. I personally believe that Robert Shaw and Roy Scheider are the true stars here. Shaw's "USS Indianapolis" monologue is one of the most effective in film history (the "Making of" feature discusses this at length in an interesting segment), and Roy Scheider's "bigger boat" adlib is possibly the best line in the entire film.<br /><br />There are many extras, including an interesting "Making of" feature, which is highly recommended viewing, even if you normally don't enjoy such things.<br /><br />Although this film has been repackaged many times (and undoubtedly will be again), to me that doesn't detract from the film itself: buy the cheapest version of "Jaws" you can find on DVD. Forget the extras if you wish: this is a film worthy of being called a true cinematic legend.</p></body></html>

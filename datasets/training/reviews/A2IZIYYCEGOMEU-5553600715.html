<meta name="summary" content="A LEGITIMATELY EERIE GHOST STORY"></head><body><p>Nicole Kidman was at the top of her game in this film. It is a crackling good suspense movie, that unwinds its chills in slow twists of plot, and superb dialogue. Amenabar quietly, subtly, and ever so deftly reveals the twisted secrets of a haunted mansion, seemingly perpetually wrapped in fog, and seething with dark psychological underpinnings.<br /><br />THE OTHERS is a trance-like walk into a deviously, evolving nightmare, with a deliciously macabre finishing flourish. Not many ghost stories are comparable to THE SIXTH SENSE, or THE INNOCENTS. This lusciously atmospheric morsel is- in spades!</p></body></html>

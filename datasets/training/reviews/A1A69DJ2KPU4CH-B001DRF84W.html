<meta name="summary" content="Much Better Than The New Hulk, But Not For Today's Short-Attention Span Viewer"></head><body><p>Since this movie is seven years old and already has plenty of reviews written, meaning it's doubtful this one will ever be seen, I'm going to keep it short. This movie was simply too smart for many of today's movie going audience. If stuff isn't blowing up every five minutes they lose interest, fast. It is no wonder to me the new Hulk was so well received compared to this one, because stuff was blowing up all the time.<br /><br />Since I don't have a short attention span and I appreciate stuff like character development, a well written script, and an emotional core to my movies, this version of the Hulk delivered in spades. The effects were also fantastic, and I thought the CGI was very convincing, better than the new Hulk with it's synthetic looking CGI, which is impressive considering the new version had six years of technology advances over this version and in my opinion had nothing to show for it. Lastly, as someone who has emotional scars from my own father, and the very troubled upbringing I had with him, this Hulk was a much more emotional experience for me than I am used to in an action/sci fi movie. I applaud what Ang Lee attempted with this version of Hulk, and how he was more interested with using the character as a catalyst for a much fuller, cerebral movie experience. Sadly since much of today's movie audience doesn't want to think during a movie, it was lost on many a viewer. If you value the same things I do in a film however, and you haven't seen this version due to the bad reviews, you owe it to yourself to give it a shot.<br /><br />[ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS]Since posting this review I have read comments regarding the review, both negative and positive. I have removed a bunch of the superfluous stuff from the original review. It was/is not my intention to come off as a pretentious, pompous, blow-hard, thus if the new Hulk works for you, than more power to you! I have to call it like I see it however, and while the new Hulk was a good action movie, that's all it was (for me). Ang Lee's Hulk offered more than that (for me) and I appreciate what he attempted with it. It's easy to create a strict action movie, it's far more difficult to create an action movie that offers a cerebral core to its plot. Movies like Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, the Sam Raimi Spiderman trilogy, and Ang Lee's Hulk all offered deep/dark psychological plot lines, that again, provided for a much fuller movie experience. There is nothing wrong with superhero movies like the X-Men trilogy, the new Hulk, the Iron Man movies  (Iron Man 1 was significantly better than 2 IMO), Thor, the Fantastic Four movies (I did not care for either of the two, I hope FF are rebooted with a far more competent director), or the Avengers, but all they were was action movies, nothing more, nothing less. Again, if that's what you prefer there is nothing wrong with that, but it's apparent from the comments to my original review, lots of movie goers appreciate a bit more to their superhero/action movies.</p></body></html>

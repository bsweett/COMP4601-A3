It somewhere along the lines of, "People rarely notice things right in front of their eyes."<br /><br />The genius of DA VINCI CODE is that, that line is so very true. We have been blinded by repetitive images. Television. Politics. Religion. We don't question, we just live and assume. Not only is that true, but the movie proves it with unmistakable evidence that will throw you for a loop and have you questioning your very lives.<br /><br />Anyway, THE DA VINCI CODE is ultimately, fiction. Yet, more than any other fiction to date, blurs the line of fiction and reality successfully. Despite all the things that are suggested in the DA VINCI CODE that would turn traditional religion on its ear, the movie pleads its case with great visuals, history, symbols, hidden meanings and unmistakable question marks hidden in real paintings by Leonardo Da Vinci.<br /><br />How many times have we've seen DaVinci's THE LAST SUPPER? Hundreds? Thousands? Yet, we are blind to the unmistakable questions that the movie poses about the painting. Sure, DaVinci obviously wasn't there at the time of the Last Supper, but it's still fun thinking about the questions his painting poses.<br /><br />THE DA VINCI CODE continues to pour on the evidence as the movie goes forward, leaving a lasting impression on your mind and your grasp of the stories we may or may not have been forced to believe throughout our lives. If anything, THE DA VINCI CODE, all be it fiction, stimulates the brain and makes you want to know more about Jesus Christ, Leonardo DaVinci and Mary Magdalene. That may be its greatest asset.<br /><br />After watching DA VINCI CODE, I find it hard to believe that there were so many bad reviews. Either they are people who are really really jaded and watch too many movies, or their religious types who are offended by the movies potential implications.<br /><br />The way I see it, God gave us brains so that we could walk, talk, think and help each other. He gave us rational thought so that we could decipher for ourselves what is right and wrong and not to just believe because we were told to.<br /><br />Ultimately, it's just a movie, and a darn good one.</p></body></html>

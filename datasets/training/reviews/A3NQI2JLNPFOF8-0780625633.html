That's a very important aspect of this film.  The hatred spewing from his mouth along with statistical evidence and insightful rhetoric places the viewer amist what seems to be an actual white supremicist rally.  It becomes easy to see how so many fall into crowds like this with characters like the fictional Derrick Vinyard preaching to the masses.  Many people don't like the way the world around them is.  They're looking for a  change.  People like Vinyard offer a path to that change.<p>But this story is mainly about redemption.  The redemption of the character in question, Derrick Vinyard.  Only after he loses everything can he begin to see the horrible path that he has beaten for his younger brother who is speedily chasing after him.  The unlikely friendship with a black prison inmate and the tutalage of his former principle are what helps him return to his humanity.  The simple yet distanced solution to all the hatred and anger that he's felt most of his life comes like an epiphany:  "It's just not worth it."  A point that he vehemently drives into those around him.<p>Be forwarned, this is not a happy story.  The ending is tragic yet depressingly real.  Hatred becomes a vicious circle.</p></body></html>

There is a lot of shooting going on, some rootin and tootin, and quite a bit of scootin.<br /><br />Mark Wahlburg is ok, I like the guy, he isn't De Niro, but he is a solid, honest actor who brings his look of quizical confusion to many of his roles, and he does here as well. The plot of both the film, and that of the actual baddies, is over complicated, with the mantra "keep is simple stupid" so beloved (and quite rightly too) of military planners entirely absent, but it makes for a high octane ride.<br /><br />Not "War and Peace", but still an enjoyable "beer and nuts" film for a weekend night.</p></body></html>

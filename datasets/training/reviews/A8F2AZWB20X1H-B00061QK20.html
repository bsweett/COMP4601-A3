Set in the third century BC during the unification of the seven kingdoms under the first Chinese emperor, the film stars Jet Li as a literally Nameless warrior who has supposedly vanquished the emperor's most fearsome enemies: Sky, played by Donnie Yen, Snow (Maggie Cheung Man-yuk), and the previously undefeatable Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu-wai).<br /><br />Nameless is escorted into the divine presence as a hero, but after hearing his account of how he defeated these three foes, the emperor isn't buying any of it; he suspects Nameless fabricated the whole thing only to get within striking distance (ten paces) of the emperor himself in order to carry out an assassination plot. The story then divides itself into a Rashomon-like re-telling from various POVs, each one photographed with strikingly vivid color shifts -- a vibrant red, a pale blue, a pristine white, and a delicate, pale green. And then we see Reality, photographed against a background of lifeless desert mesas which seems to emphasize the futility of it all.<br /><br />The most compelling characters in the film are Snow and Broken Sword -- she's a single-minded woman warrior with a take-no-prisoners mentality, and Broken Sword, her lover, is a warrior who has fought one fight too many and no longer believes that the sword is the only option to resolving conflicts. But Snow, like the true believer she is, loves her principles more than him, and the resulting confrontation between them is as inevitable as it is tragic.<br /><br />The acting is excellent all around. Jet Li is an appealing and likeable hero (or is he an anti-hero?), and Tony Leung gives a totally convincing performance as Broken Sword. The cast is rounded out by the exquisitely beautiful Zhang Ziyi as Broken Sword's servant Moon, in love with her master and faithful to the end, and Chen Dao Ming as the emperor of Chin.<br /><br />There are going to be endless comparisons between "Hero" and "Crouching Tiger", Ang Lee's masterpiece. Visually, "Hero" can hold its own against "Crouching Tiger" any day in the week. And yet, somehow, it doesn't grab you emotionally in the way "Crouching Tiger" does. "Hero" is gorgeous to look at and maybe that's its problem, it's so eye-popping to watch that the story doesn't measure up to its pure visual impact. Zhang doesn't do a "Rashomon" tale as brilliantly as the late, great Akira Kurosawa, and in this film he doesn't grip us as totally as Ang Lee, but he's delivered a movie that, at least to watch, is eminently satisfying.<br /><br />Judy Lind</p></body></html>

You definitely feel for the guy.  This movie will make you angry.  It will make you sad.  It will make you cheer.  You will wonder how you would have done given the same set of circumstances.  I only want to see it once because of the grief suffered, but I do want my kids to see it when they are old enough to understand to help motivate them.</p></body></html>

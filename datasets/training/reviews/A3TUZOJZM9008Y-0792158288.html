<meta name="summary" content="If adventure has a name..."></head><body><p>it is three great movies. Okay, bad name for adventure. How about Henry "Indiana" Jones, Jr.?<p>In a return to the early serials of their childhood, George Lucas and Steven Spielberg invented an archeologist/adventurer by the name of Jones. Originally to be played by Tom Selleck, Harrision Ford stepped in when Selleck couldn't get out of doing a TV series (Magnum, PI). Each man ended up with a signature role to call their own.<p>Raiders of the Lost Ark - Where the adventure all began. Ford, along with Karen Allen, try to stop the Nazi regime from finding the Lost Ark of the Covenent. A roller coaster ride from beginning to end. Perhaps the best of the three.<p>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom - A prequel which sees Indy team up with a kid and Mrs. Spielberg on another quasi-religious quest. While darker and less satisfyiong than the first, still an excellent film.<p>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade - It's Indy against the Nazi horde once again. This time, our hero sets out to save his father (Sean Connery), and find the Holy Grail, literally. They played up the comic elements more in this one, but it was better received than the second installment.<p>All in all, this is one of the best trilogies in movie history. If the rumored fourth film ever manages to make it to screen, this set will probably be replaced in a few years.</p></body></html>

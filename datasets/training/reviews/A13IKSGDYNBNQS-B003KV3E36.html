<meta name="summary" content="Better than expected"></head><body><p>I wanted to hate this movie so much, but came away having been throughly entertained (in an extremly violent way) for 90 minutes. It was a blood splattered 90 minutes but it was better than I expected.<br /><br />Rambo has retired to Thailand, but he's still in top shape. Stallone of course is still in good shape aged 60. I won't discuss steroids at this point.... A group of missionaries are trying to helped the sick and wounded in Burmah. The people are living under a military regime which is brutal in the extreme. The missionaries are captured and Rambo ultimataly helps a group of mercenaries to get them out. The body count is vast, it might be a record for I know. If you have any problems with watching bloody scenes I'd give this film a miss as there are a great many which involve huge blood loss!<br /><br />The ending is well done, taking you almost full circle back to First Blood from 1982. However making comparisons with that film are a mistake as it isn't in the same class. The main reason is a lack of another major character to support Stallone. In First blood we had the always excellent Brian Denehy as the local Sheriff, in Rambo there's nobody.<br /><br />However overall I shall be quite happy to watch this again. Its not a great film but it is a lot better than I expected.</p></body></html>

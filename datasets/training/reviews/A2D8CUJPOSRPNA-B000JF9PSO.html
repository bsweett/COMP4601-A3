<meta name="summary" content="Gut-Wrenching, Humanistic Look At 9/11"></head><body><p>When one thinks of September 11, 2001, one usually thinks of the War on Terror that it helped spawn.  But the politics of 9/11's aftermath are just one aspect of it, and it is something that writer/director Paul Greengrass (THE BOURNE SUPREMACY) has chosen to sidestep in favor of a gut-wrenching, humanistic approach in his film UNITED 93.<br /><br />United Airlines Flight 93, enroute from Newark to San Francisco on that fateful morning, was the only one of the four hijacked planes that didn't reach its intended target (which, as the film shows, was most likely the U.S. Capitol Building).  This is because the passengers onboard, knowing already that two planes had nailed the World Trade Center and a third had taken out the southwest corner of the Pentagon, quickly formulated a plan to try and take back control of the aircraft from the four Islamist terrorists who had taken it over.  Although their attempt to regain control of the aircraft was doomed to end in a field sixty miles outside of Pittsburgh, their actions saved untold thousands of lives in the nation's capitol.<br /><br />Utilizing a docudrama approach via hand-held cameras, as well as razor-sharp editing, Greengrass, working with a cast of largely unknown actors plus some of the very civilian air traffic and military personnel who were there on that terrible day, made UNITED 93 an intense experience, but one that avoids political grandstanding.  This film is about people, pure and simple--from the people in the civilian and military air trafic control centers faced with a thoroughly impossible situation, to the fanatical hijackers, to the passengers who were determined to stop them.<br /><br />Of course, there are well-reasoned arguments against UNITED 93, that it is too soon for a 9/11-related film to be released now (though maybe FAHRENHEIT 9/11 slipped everyboody's mind).  But exactly when WOULD be the right time?  After all, films about the 1978 Jonestown tragedy and the 1976 Entebbe incident were both made within 18-24 months of those events.  Besides, UNITED 93 is never exploitational--violent, yes, and unavoidably so, but definitely never exploitational.  It is a film to be commended for being a deep human interest story of the highest order, and Greengrass, his cast, and his crew are to be commended for their extremely laudable efforts here.</p></body></html>

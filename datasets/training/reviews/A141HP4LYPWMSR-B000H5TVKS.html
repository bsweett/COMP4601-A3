More gore, more special effects, more characters in jeopardy, etc... In doing so one takes the risk of losing that intangible element that made the first film a success. Well the film 'Saw II' did just that, more of everything. But you know what? It worked beautifully!<br /><br />'Saw II' was successful in taking all the successful elements from the first film; expanding the cast, improving the effects, intensifying the psychological angst and physical gore while maintaining a strong narrative continuity with the original movie. Even more impressive was the manner in which they were able to have so many new things going on and still add psychological depth and breath to an already great protagonist (Jigsaw played by Tobin Bell).<br /><br />There are a lot of clever and unexpected twists and turns in this one that really leave an already strong storyline up to many more sequels to come!<br /><br />Almost forgot, I loved Shawnee Smith in the role of Amanda.</p></body></html>

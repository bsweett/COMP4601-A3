<meta name="summary" content="A good sandwich"></head><body><p>The movie has many great moments, but it doesn't really build on them. Nothing really happens in the movie. The plot meanders. The relationships work sometimes. The movie does a good job of developing Tea's character as the psychotic wife. The viewer gets a fuller and fuller picture of her dysfuntionality as the movie goes on. However, her personality is all over the map and it is hard to get a good picture of her. Adam Sandler's character works as the super nice husband. The maid character is supposed to be sane, but never really works out that way. The daughter of the maid's voice over is really confusing sometimes and I don't think it helps much at all.<br /><br />The movie does score some very direct emotional and humourous hits, but it misses just as much. I enjoyed it, but is a rocky ride. The extras includes how to make "The world's best sandwich." The commentaries were good too.</p></body></html>

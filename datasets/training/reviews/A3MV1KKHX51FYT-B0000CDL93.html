<meta name="summary" content="The Anti-Warren Report Documentary"></head><body><p>This film is based on Jim Garrison's book, which tells of his investigation into the conspiracy. JG joined the National Guard in 1940, served five years in Army artillery, went to law school, joined the FBI, went home to New Orleans, and was elected District Attorney (3 terms) and then a judge. The controversy around this movie is due to Oliver Stone's dramatization of the facts. In one scene DA Garrison points out that LH Oswald's Camp St. address was across from the FBI, the CIA, and Naval Intelligence. At that point in time the offices of the FBI and CIA were a few blocks away. But the point is dramatically made: the "Fair Play for Cuba Committee" was practically underfoot. Who was watching them?<p>I think it was a mistake to cast Ed Asner as the private detective who was former Naval Intelligence, former FBI. Efrem Zimbalist JR had a better resemblance. Walter Matthau played Senator Russell Long. The movie generally follows the book. DA Garrison hears of the connection to David Ferrie, and turns him over to the FBI; nothing happened. A few years later he talks to Senator Long and learns of his doubts on the Warren Report. JG then opens his own investigation into any crime committed in New Orleans. When his secret investigation is uncovered, the corporate media vilify his operation. There was NO cooperation from either J Edgar Hoover, President LBJ, or government agencies. The trial ended with a 'not guilty' verdict. The Congressional investigations in the 1970s revealed many more facts. Many books were written from this new information.<p>The "Mister X" brought in as a 'deus ex machina' is not in Garrison's book. He is based on L Fletcher Prouty, whose articles or books were available to Oliver Stone. LF Prouty joined the Army in 1941, and retired decades later. His experiences were in "Black Ops": executive action for the Government. Prouty was in the Philippines, Vietnam, etc. Prouty pointed out that it was SOP to have Army officers scout any location for a Presidential visit. It was not done in Dallas. The questions of "Mr X" remain: who benefited from JFK's assassination, and, who could cover it up.<p>So watch and enjoy this drama. You should read "On the Trail of the Assassins", or other books on the unsolved mystery of the Assassination of JFK. Is the conspiracy still trying to kill JFK's reputation? JFK was neither the first or last Ruler to enjoy female companionship as a perquisite of office, like stars in music or sports. Politicians are not moral role leaders, like ministers, priests, or rabbis. <p>An assassin who uses a pistol will be caught or killed. They are fanatics who sacrifice themselves for their cause. As assassin who uses a rifle will be able to get away to collect his pay; this implies a conspiracy. You can decide for yourself.</p></body></html>

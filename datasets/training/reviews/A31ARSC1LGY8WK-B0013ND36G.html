<meta name="summary" content="OK action film let down by an overall air of familiarity"></head><body><p>"T3 - Rise of The Machines" is a decent entry in the big, dumb action (BDA) movie genre. Nick Stahl adds depth to the role of John Connor - future leader of the resistance and Claire Daines is pretty good as his love interest Catherine Brewster but Governor Schwartzenegger's acting has not improved - even playing a robot (the "good" termininator) - and Kristina Loken makes a memorable if rather one-note "bad" terminator. The film has all the stunning special effects and spectacular stunts you would expect in a BDA but the main problem the film can never quite overcome is an overall air of familiarity.</p></body></html>

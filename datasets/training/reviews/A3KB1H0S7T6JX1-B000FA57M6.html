<meta name="summary" content="Though not a masterpiece, a movie worth watching!"></head><body><p>I have to say that I am not a fan of the game Doom nor have I ever played the game, so I cannot take part in discussing the technicalities and the specifics like other reviewers have. Therefore, coming from someone that is not familiar with the "details" I have to say that the movie was pretty good!<br />The film is an action-packed sci-fi adventure combining significant elements of horror.<br />It starts off like Stargate then turns into Alien and then goes Resident Evil on us.<br />The acting is above average with Karl Urban (from LOR), the Rock (from Scorpion King) and Rosamund Pike, a Halle Berry type (which is definitely a bonus) doing a good job in their respective roles.<br />The setting, the plot, the special effects, the battles and the special effects are all very good!<br />In conclusion, the film establishes a GREAT cliffhanger for a sequel, which I would definitely line up to watch!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="the horrifying truth about American health care"></head><body><p>Sicko is perhaps best described as an expos&eacute; by Michael Moore on the disgusting failings of the American health care industry to pay for necessary medical procedures even though their customers have paid their premiums and "played by the rules." We see heartrending stories of Americans treated cruelly, to say the least, by their health insurance carriers. Just as many other reviewers note, there are pathetic, sad stories of grown parents having to move in with their children because they went bankrupt paying for three heart attacks; and there's the story of a 79 year old man who has to work at a Pathmark supermarket doing heavy lifting so that he and his aged wife can have the medicines they need every day.<br /><br />The horror stories continue, mostly with the fat cats of the health care companies getting seven figure annual salaries based on how much health care they deny to their "customers." We learn from professionals and analysts that the less care any health insurance company gives the more money they make--and their executives get rich on this terrible truth.<br /><br />There is one scene in which a doctor tells a Congressional hearing that she is still haunted by a decision she made to deny a man a life-necessary operation. As a result of her decision she was promoted to a six figure a year job. Moore also notes that Hillary Clinton did try to get universal health care but her idea died before it could become a reality.<br /><br />Moore travels to other countries to see what they do there about insuring people's health. We learn that in Canada, England, Norway, and France, socialized medicine is quite acceptable because the citizens of these countries truly believe that they should have health care for all. Naturally, this is done through much higher taxes; but at least they never worry about a hospital stay, getting tough pre-approvals for life saving procedures and more.<br /><br />You'll easily remember the Michael Moore "stunt;" he takes rescue workers from September 11th and sails to Cuba with them so that they can get free health care at Guantanamo Bay. Fortunately for the workers they do get treated on the island although they don't get their treatment on the military base.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I must say that I think Moore painted the picture of these other countries a bit too rosy. I have friends in Holland who certainly don't live as well as the foreigners interviewed in their homes by Michael Moore. In addition, how fast you get health care in other countries often depends on how sick you are--you may have to wait ten months for a hip replacement if doctors there decide that you can wait.<br /><br />Overall, however, Michael Moore makes his case a very solid one; and I certainly agree with him on this issue. We should have at least an optional universal health care program so that people who don't want to participate don't feel forced into it.<br /><br />The DVD has a plethora of extras that really add a lot to the experience of watching the movie. There are great interview segments with Tony Benn, a former member of Britain's Parliament; and we see Moore having an "extra" premiere of his film in a Los Angeles ghetto with audience members who probably can't even afford to see the movie in a movie theater. There is more footage still of Michael Moore and legislators in Washington fighting for universal health care.<br /><br />Sicko is a fine film by Michael Moore that cries out for universal health care. Moore wants a better standard of living in America; and he hopes Americans develop more concern for other Americans--something that is very often lacking in the United States. I highly recommend this film.</p></body></html>

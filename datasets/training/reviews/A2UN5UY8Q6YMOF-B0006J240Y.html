<meta name="summary" content="tired plot yields disappointing film"></head><body><p>I chose this movie under the assumption that it would be a psycological thriller with perhaps a touch of the supernatural much like the 6th Sense.  Instead, it turned out to be a cliched government conspiracy, alien UFO movie.  At times I thought I was watching a poorly made episode of the X-Files.  Is it a coincidence that Julianne Moore plays the red-headed lead named "Telly", while the X-Files female lead was another red-head by the name of "Sculley"?  Maybe I'm paranoid, but this movie stinks.  The writers could not even come up with a plausible reason for the aliens' experiments.  The DVD contains 2 endings, both of which were garbage, but the theatrical ending was actually the worst.  Julianne does a compentant job playing a grieving mother, but the rest of the cast is forgetable.  Julianne seems to be a fine actress, but when has she ever picked a good script?  At least the title is appropriate since this movie should be among the forgotten.</p></body></html>

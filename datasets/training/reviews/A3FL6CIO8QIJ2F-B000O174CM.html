<meta name="summary" content=""An Entertaining Musical""></head><body><p>Movie musicals gained new notoriety with the release of "Chicago" a few years back, so it was only natural that a studio was going to finally release the film version of "Dreamgirls". I say finally because ever since "Dreamgirls" debut on Broadway in 1981, starring Jennifer Holiday, there has been talk that this fine show would make it to the big screen. In 2006 "Dreamgirls" premiered at the boxoffice to audience and critical acclaim.<br /> I first saw most of the cast of "Dreamgirls" when they promoted the film on "Oprah" and I knew it was going to be a huge hit. Beyonce, Jennifer Hudson, Eddie Murphy, and Jamie Foxx star in this film based on the lives of 1960's girl group The Supremes. However, it is Jennifer Hudson's searing performance of Ellfie that steals the film with Oprah telling her that watching Hudson's performance is like "a religious experience".  She plays the role based on the life of Florence ballard, the Supreme who became an alcoholic and died broke. Beyonce is also great in the Diana Ross role. Everything from the beautiful music to the costumes is excellent, and you do not have to be a fan of Broadway musicals to enjoy this film. "Dreamgirls" is an entertaining movie for everyone who has ever had a dream of making it big in show business. Jennifer Hudson would reach superstardom by winning that years Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role in the film.<br /> This 2 disc set comes with a slew of bonuses, the best being a two hour documentary on how "Dreamgirls" was developed from Broadway to film.<br /> "Dreamgirls" has so far made over 154 million dollars worldwide.</p></body></html>

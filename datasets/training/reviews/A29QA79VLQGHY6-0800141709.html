This "40th Anniversary Special Edition" of Stanley Kubrick's blackest of black comedies targets households bunkered for the widescreen age. The primary upgrades are the high-definition transfer (its first) and -- more dramatically -- a re-engineering into 1.66:1 anamorphic widescreen.<br /><br />Aspect ratios usually don't draw attention, but "Strangelove" is a special and controversial case. The previous Columbia DVD, released in 2001 (included in Warner Bros.' "Stanley Kubrick Collection"), followed specs issued by the director. Kubrick's home-vid vision -- presumably influenced by VHS and the square TVs that still dominated in the 1990s -- was mostly full screen (1.33:1) with some slight ratio adjustments. Criterion's marvelous laserdisc of 1992 shifted between 1.66 and 1.33, again per Kubrick.<br /><br />Columbia's latest thinking was to redeploy "Strangelove" in its "correct" original British theatrical widescreen ratio of 1.66, providing consistent dimensions scene-to-scene as in 1964. A direct comparison of the 2001 DVD and the new disc reveals a lot of lost visual information, some significant. The effect on compositions inside on Ken Adam's famed War Room set ranges from meaningless to dramatic when A-B'd. The transfer holds other surprises. The new version is markedly darker at the expense of imagery previously much more brightly cast. The older versions tended toward coarse, blown-out contrasts, however, and many viewers will appreciate the new more elegant and sinister look. Sony's restorers were able to exterminate a lot of the debris evident on the older DVD, even though they used materials several generations away from the mother negative (the original is long gone).<br /><br />Audio options are Dolby Digital, DTS and mono, all solid choices, but don't expect much from the 40-year-old sound. (Kubrick wanted you to hear it in mono.) The 5.1 formats add some rear-channel rattle and hum from the bombers and some echoes, but the sound mostly holds its center-channel position. All that great dialogue from Kubrick and Terry Southern is crystal clear, an upgrade from the 2001 version, which sounds a bit hollow.</p></body></html>

There's Thomas Harris' novel of course, and Michael Mann's derivative mid-eighties interpretation of it, sub nom Manhunter (apparently so as not to be mistaken for a martial arts movie!). Looming even larger is Jonathan Demme's Silence of the Lambs, which most critics (this one included) will tell you is the pick of the Lecter Bunch. Weighing in for good measure is Ridley Scott's baroque, and markedly under-rated, Hannibal.<p>Ratner's Red Dragon is indebted to all, but transcends none, of these. It is a much better picture than Manhunter (I don't understand how conventional wisdom has managed to conclude that Manhunter is good cinema: it just isn't); Red Dragon is better executed; there's better workmanship; clearer plot exposition, it's far less a hostage to style - but on the other hand it borrows its style wholesale from Silence of the Lambs.<p>Overall, Red Dragon is workmanlike and no more. Anthony Hopkins can be dealt with quickly: the character of Hannibal Lecter has already been fully mined for chill (in Lambs) and as some sort of hammy, homicidal galloping gourmet (in Hannibal), so he steered an easy course between the two, relishing his one or two choice lines, but otherwise sleepwalking it. Harvey Keitel was a big disappointment: here he demonstrates how little he can actually act (he is terrific in films where he doesn't have to), while Edward Norton turns in a solid performance, leaving only Philip Seymour Hoffman to add any colour. Emily Watson stands out as Reba McLane and Ralph Fiennes acts well - he plays it extremely straight - but is handicapped (ahem) by his fundamental lack of ugliness. Note to file: without substantially more in the way of prosthetics, Francis Dolarhyde should not be played by one of the most handsome men on the planet. <p>Silence of the Lambs had the element of surprise and novelty, but more than that it succeeded through the complex character of Clarice Starling and her absorbing relationship with the equally fascinating Doctor. Red Dragon has none of this. Will Graham is a less interesting literary character than Clarice Starling, and to the extent there is an underlying story (in the novel Harris makes much of Graham's questionable sanity and his empathy with serial killers), Ratner largely fails to bring it out, and when Graham does get a line on the subject, at the very end (having read Dolarhyde's scrapbook, he admits he feels sorry for him), Norton misses the opportunity to imbue it with any real meaning.<p>The screenplay is patchy, too. There's no excuse: its writer, Ted Tally, scripted Lambs. But there is some pretty clumsy plot exposition, mostly out of the mouths of Keitel and Norton. And some things which work in a novel just don't play out on celluloid: the idea of Dolarhyde eating a William Blake painting is all very well as a figurative device. But just try filming it. Foolishly, Ratner did.<p>But for all that it's an entertaining film, even if it is a pretty obvious potboiler. But no work of art.</p></body></html>

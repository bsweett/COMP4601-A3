I saw several reviews over the course of the last year that claimed No Country for Old Men was a disappointment. I found it to be anything but that. Honestly, at just over 2 hours long, I wished its length was double. Its ending may not be what viewers desire but it was appropriate given the nature of the characters. I found The Ladykillers very poor so I see this movie as definitely being a return to form for the Coen brothers who, next to Martin Scorsese, are the best directors of our era (in my opinion). Yes, Josh Brolin was excellent, yes, Tommy Lee Jones was excellent, but this fellow Javier Bardem was absolutely superb. I had never heard of him previously, but he played the perfect villain--a mixture of subtlety and aggression. The guy is scarier than DeNiro was in Cape Fear. He made the film for me, but then again, the Cormac McCarthy plot would have won me over anyway.</p></body></html>

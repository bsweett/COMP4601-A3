<meta name="summary" content="Just a Fun Movie"></head><body><p>I really enjoyed Independence Day. Will Smith was riot and Bill Pullman as the President of the USA was a kick.<p>However, having just seen Emmerich's The Day After Tomorrow, I was left wondering whether he has it in for DC, Los Angeles and NYC.  Actually, I was rather surprised at how many cheered when I watched this in the theater when the White House got it.....what were these people thinking.<p>Anyway, this movie takes you all around the world and of course a bit of luck is what causes the good guys to win.  I really got a kick out of how the Aliens on the mother ship say &quot;uh oh....&quot; when they realize their goose is cooked.  <p>Interesting the graphics of the larger buildings being the target of the aliens.  Sadly the implosion of the Library Tower and the Empire State Building looked all too much like that of the WTC.<p>I can still remember the look on the man's face while looking up in disbelief as the alien ship over Manhattan begins to ignite the Empire State Building.  This as a fascinating movie and fun for the most part.  The story did drag a bit at times.  I look forward to getting the limited edition.</p></body></html>

I figured it was just another pop release along the lines of the lackluster "We Own the Night." I was totally wrong though and could not stop watching once it started. I'd put it right up there with The Departed, but below masterpieces such as The Godfather and Goodfellas. No matter where you place it, American Gangster touches on a seldom discussed topic in the history of crime and is riveting. If you haven't seen Across 110th Street it really adds to this film's appeal. Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe were magnificent and I was pleased to see Chiwetel Ejiofor in the cast. I loved "Dirty Pretty Things" and he gave an amazing performance as Okwe. Josh Brolin's Detective Trupo was haunting. I know, of course, of his dad and step-mom but was not familiar with him beforehand. Overall, American Gangster is a must see.</p></body></html>

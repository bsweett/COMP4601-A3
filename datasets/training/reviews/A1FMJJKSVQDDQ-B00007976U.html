<meta name="summary" content="A psychological thriller/drama that is intense, disturbing, and gut-wrenchingly powerful"></head><body><p>It's rare to see a family in a photograph that is full of sorrow and despair. Most of the time, it's a requirement to have smiling faces in a family picture. Nobody wants to see any sort of sad expression on a face, because that's not what people would want to remember when it's revisited. It's the exact opposite of the news: we want FOND memories of life. And sometimes when we look at a smiling family in a Kodak picture, we wish we had that sort of happiness in the past (and in the present). It may seem odd to some people, but never to the main character of "One Hour Photo": Sy Parrish.<br /><br />In the film, Sy (played by Robin Williams) is one of those people that we never really notice everyday. He works at a clinic in a department store, and he seems to be nothing but air. Very few people care about him (mainly his customers).  He's neither a celebrity nor a messiah. People would pass him by and would always be oblivious of his presence, and it's only because they've got other things in mind. As a matter of fact, he would actually blend in the white and gray walls due to the dull colors of his clothing. Sy doesn't look like he acknowledges his mediocre existence, but it's clear that he cares about his work. He is fully dedicated to creating photos, but it's unfortunate that his line of work offers him nothing in return. He is not married, and he has very little friends (probably none). Whenever he heads home from work, all he does is feed his pet hamster and watch television. His life is devastatingly empty, and he just wants the world to see that he existed. Something does give him happiness, though. There is a customer named Nina Yorkin (played by Connie Nielsen) who brings in family photos, and Sy happily process them. She is his favorite customer, and therefore, her photos are the ones that he admires the most. In fact, he loves them so much that they have actually become a part of his life. The smiles and the various colorful images on these photos make him happy, because this looks like the one thing that was missing his entire life: a perfect family. He has the desire to become a part of the "supposed" picture-perfect family that's embedded on hand-sized pieces of paper, and he'll do anything to make sure that it this happiness stays within, even if it results in severe consequences.<br /><br />Director Mark Romanek has done a splendid job with "One Hour Photo." He and Jeff Cronenweth, the cinematographer, have made the correct look of the film: the contrasts of light and color between Sy's apartment, the department store, and the Yorkins' home are very well-done. Romanek has also formed the appropriate pacing for this movie: nothing is ever too slow or too rushed. Credit should also go to Reinhold Heil & Johnny Klimek for the chilling yet beautiful music score. Actually, credit should go to everyone who was involved with this film.<br /><br />Robin Williams is mostly known for his comedic work. I don't admire a majority of the films that he appeared in, but I admire him for his abstract comic timings and improvisations. His dramatic work, however, has surprised millions of people because this is the exact opposite of what he has been associated with. I'm not particularly shocked by this change of pace, but I was deeply fascinated by not only his character, but also his performance in the film. Robin has that quiet, awkward personality down perfectly for his character, and his complete absorption of Sy Parrish's mannerisms and dialogue is really a mesmerizing sight to see. The supporting cast does a very good job as well. Nielsen, Michael Vartan, and Dylan Smith were very appropriate as the Yorkins, while Gary Cole plays Bill Owens, the store manager, with very few flaws.<br /><br />"One Hour Photo" is not a feel-good film, nor is it trying to be one. It succeeds at being a psychological thriller/drama that delves into solemn real-world issues. It's depressing, but it's also powerful. It's not exactly perfect, but it's still an effective film, and it remains on my list of all-time favorites.<br /><br />Grade: 9.5/10</p></body></html>

There are some worthwhile concepts present, but all are never developed in a good fashion.<br />  KATE BECKENSALE is horrible.  A badly written character played with a badly miscast actress makes for a hard time watching with any conviction.  She just looks uncomfortable.<br />  The werewolf effects are atrocious.  With a plot surrounding a vampire/werewolf war, you end up rooting for the wolves; that is until you witness their transformation.  Bad FX.<br />  The action scenes are stillborn.  The build up is as suspenseful as slumber and the delivery is rehash.  Without some fleeting half-creativity the entire film is an all out rip-off of the ultra-far superior BLADE (1&amp;2), and borrows some inspiration from THE MATRIXes.<br />  The direction is slipshod.  Obviously lensed by a first timer working with an amateur script.  I can't believe they are already filming not one but TWO sequels.  Totally unnessesary.<br />  Check out the flick DOG SOLDIERS instead.  That film has the action, horror, and werewolves, that works with the sense to not take itself seriously.<br />  Given the subject matter, UNDERWORLD should have been a lot better of a movie.  I love vampire and werewolf films, and there really aren't that many good ones.  UNDERWORLD has both aforementioned creatures, and still ranks at the botttom of both catagories.  So I'll have to say that it's definitely bad.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Single Best War Biography Ever Filmed!"></head><body><p>When this movie was released, it was almost immediately recognized as one of the finest, most accurate and most sensational biographies ever filmed. The unique integration in "Patton" of such fine acting, such a wonderful  script, and the filming itself combined to make this a gorgeous film to  watch, be entertained with, and also learn from in terms of its historical  value as an absolutely superb depiction of a most controversial man and his  times. All that said, this is a movie best enjoyed with the kind of visual  clarity, terrific cinematography, and matchless Technicolor it offers by  way of DVD technology. <p>George C. Scott gives the performance of a  lifetime as the ego-drive, brilliant, and iconoclastic Patton, marvel of  the U.S Army, a man the Germans are convinced is far and away the single  best General the Allies have, and they watch him convinced he is the only  logical centerpiece for American plans for the impending invasion of  Europe.  Of course, they didn't understand the politics of the day, or the  degree to which Patton was his own worst enemy. Yet the progress of the  story on the screen convinces the viewer of the accuracy of the German  command's judgments of him; he is at once bold, brilliant, and innovative,  willing to improvise as he goes along to seize the opportunity of a given  moment, attempting to grab hold of the ever-present chaos of the situation  to transform it into an asset he can employ to gain advantage and win the  engagement. <p>Such men as Patton (and MacArthur and others) are uniquely  suited for war; they do not ordinarily fare well or survive with much  public acclaim during less extreme and bloodcurdling times. The fact that  Eisenhower, for example, succeeded so well as President is probably due  more to the fact that he was less a battlefield commander and leader of  "desperate men in combat" like Patton than he was a superb organizer and a  natural politician. The movie &quot;Patton&quot; is an investment in both  great entertainment and a colorful, dramatic, and educational video you can  share with your sons and daughters to help them understand better the  chaos, contradictions, and cruelties of war. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

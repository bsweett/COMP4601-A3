"Team America:  World Police" isn't much of either.  Oh, there are a few bits I guffawed it, not limited to the infamous, graphic puppet sex scene, which lampoons, among other things, the MPAA's rather narrow-minded view that showing sex without genitals will somehow be less problematic than showing sex with.  Kim Jong Il is a hoot, about the only aspect consistently amusing, though he's so much like Saddam Hussein in the much, much better "South Park:  The Movie," right down to his demise, that it felt like I was viewing outtakes from the previous effort.  And while the puppets are an interesting -- and cheap -- novelty, they're never really used in quite the same stylish fashion as the Gerry Anderson shows from the 60s they invoke.  Ostensibly the plot of "Team America: World Police" concerns an elite if clueless group of WASPy heroes who save the world from terrorists . . . while generally destroying much of what they've come to save.  The swipes at U.S. foreign policies that impose values rather than inspire them are here, but both liberals (in the form of Hollywood headline-mongers and armchair diplomats) and conservatives (as freedom-through-firepower types, echoed in the movie's absurdly jingoistic country music songs) take it on the chin.  Yet for all the hoopla, this Parker/Stone vehicle never is all that clever.  The humor is about what you'd expect from sixth-graders playing naughty with dolls, and the satire is too obvious to be biting.  I'm sure the film is a hit around frat houses, but that's probably about it.  If you want more -- and I hope you do -- you'll need to look elsewhere.</p></body></html>

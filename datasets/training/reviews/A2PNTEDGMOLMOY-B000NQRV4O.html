<meta name="summary" content="Dark tale of selfish love and infidelity among unlikeable foursome"></head><body><p>"Closer," if nothing else, is a refreshing change for major movie releases in that it truly defies established formulas.  If your best friend said that there was a new movie about love and romance and it stars Julia Roberts, Natalie Portman, and Jude Law (plus the rakishly handsome Clive Owen), you'd probably leap to the conclusion that a studio had tried to make "Love Actually II" or some other sappy romantic comedy.<br /><br />Nothing could be further from the truth.  In a movie that revolves intensely around the four leads as two couples who, shall we say, "interact," it's hard to find a likable chap or gal.  Selfishness and betrayal rule the day, along with graphic language about sex.  I'm not talking overly clinical language, I'm talking about the language of people who use sex as a means to establish dominance and superiority, not intimacy or even enjoyment.  Guilt and shame are at least as prevalent as love and affection, and truth may be the rarest commodity of all.<br /><br />Be warned -- this is not a feel-good movie in any way.  That's not to say that it's a "bad movie," of course.  My three-star rating stems from the fact that the movie spans a few years, yet the transitions between leaps forward and flashes back are confusing, and the characters generally talk like movie characters and not real people (listening to Jude Law explain his job as a writer of obituaries rings false, and I'm not sure a woman like Natalie Portman's character "Alice" has ever walked the earth).<br /><br />Still, if you're looking for a dark examination of the war between the sexes (and we are talking about war), and you've worn out your copy of "In the Company of Men," or you find "The War of the Roses" too cheery, this may be just the movie for you.</p></body></html>

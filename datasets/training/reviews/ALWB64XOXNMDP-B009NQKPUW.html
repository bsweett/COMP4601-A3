<meta name="summary" content="Fantastic art airection without a good script"></head><body><p>I'd have to sum up Prometheus like this:  Five stars for art direction, one star for the script.  It was fantastic to look at. However, all the character archetypes are still there. It's esscially the original Alien with a few changes.  That being, how they originated.  While I wanted to like this film; Ridley should have stepped in and made changes to the script.<br /><br />This prequel is to be part of a trilogy, according to Scott.  Where is he going to go from here?  I'd make Prometheus a dream if I were a director.  Without giving away major elements of the story, for those who haven't seen this movie, all the mystery is gone.  We are left with a very simplistic answer to all the questions that have been part of the franchise.</p></body></html>

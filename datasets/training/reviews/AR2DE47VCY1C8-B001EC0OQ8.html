It was lost in transit to the king.  Crusted with jewels of immense value, but covered with black lacquer to disguise its worth, it was lost for centuries.  This story is about the struggle between factions of villains to get the bird.<p><p>If you have never see Bogart in this movie, you have missed one which is partly responsible for his fame.<p><p>Joseph (Joe) Pierre<p></p></body></html>

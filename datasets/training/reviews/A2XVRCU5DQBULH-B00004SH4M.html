<meta name="summary" content="Bond at his very best..."></head><body><p>Sean Connery's third outing as James Bond is one of the best in the series. This time, Bond goes after German baddie Auric Goldfinger, played by Gert Forbe. There are tons of Bond landmarks including Oddjob, the Aston Martin DB5, a cool theme song, and one heckuva car chase! Plus, Connery is the personification of cool as James Bond. Only Pierce Brosnan can measure up to Connery, but even then he's just as good, not better. Connery is the man and this movie (as well as &quot;From Russia With Love&quot;) proves it. The film has tons of memorable moments that lead up to a fantastic final battle with Bond squaring off against Oddjob in Fort Knox. This scene is one of the best in the series and possibly one of the best fight scenes ever filmed. This is truly a great movie.</p></body></html>

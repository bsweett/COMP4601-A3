<meta name="summary" content="Great Movie, Great Extras on 1 Disc..."></head><body><p>Overall its a great film, there are plenty of extras, and all on one disc. I don't just mean extras separate to the movie, there are lots of in jokes, which may be a little bit of the problem with some people not finding some things funny. One thing I found not funny after purchasing the DVD, was the partially confirmed rumour that HOT FUZZ is coming out on a multi-disc version later this year, one reference can be found in the current commentary on this release where Simon Pegg refers to the "other commentary", well there is only one.And I completed a survey which refers to a Multi disc version coming out on a specific date.<br />Anyways, its clear that the guys are experimenting with development, since a bigger budget allows this, as well as getting Edward Woodward, although I did not spot Edward until I read the credits went back and saw who Tom Weaver was... seems like Edward is the Frenetic star you have when you just want a damn fine actor. And the other key point is that they have some of Britains finest Thespians.<br />The Movie, the Comentary, the Text info track, and etc all mean many hours of repeat watchings.<br />ENJOY</p></body></html>

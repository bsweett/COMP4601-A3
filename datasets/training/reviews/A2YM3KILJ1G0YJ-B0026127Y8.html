<meta name="summary" content="Good luck."></head><body><p>The setup in concept and execution is brilliant.  Even the trailer made not apologies about the type of movie it was going to be.  Someone takes Bryan's (Neeson) little girl Kim (Grace), but doesn't realize he is a very dangerous man capable of some serious damage when provoked.  The rest of a movie is a chase to find Kim, where Bryan uses his vast array of skills acquired as a former FBI agent to track down the evil criminals involved in her abduction.<br /><br />Before allowing Kim to go on vacation to Paris with a friend, Bryan insists on precaution.  He's hesitant in the first place, denying her initial request; however, he eventually relents but with a few requirements.  Kim gets a cell phone and must stay in constant contact with her father.  Off she goes to Europe away from daddy's protection.  Within a single day, but not too quickly, his daughter calls her father.  While on the phone she sees her friend get kidnapped, and her father lets her know she is also going to be taken.  Dad is not pleased, informs the bad guy as much, and the bad guy's reply, "Good luck."  The hunt is on.<br /><br />Make no mistake about it, get in Bryan's way and you'll be punished.  If he has time, and you pose a particularly burdensome obstacle, you may even die.  For the most part he drops various bad guys with single head shots.  Other than Captain Kirk's infamous neck chop, there has not been such one-punch precision in the history of combat.  Every criminal element involved is essentially a punching bag, rag doll waiting for the coup de grace.<br /><br />Will he get to his daughter in time?  The power of this movie is the suspense, not knowing if he'll make it in time to save Kim from danger, or if he'll find her at all.  Great action movie, something that goes from zero to sixty in no time at all, and never takes pressure off the throttle.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A good political thriller, but I expected more."></head><body><p>David Mamet's "Spartan" is a taut, polished, cynically satisfying political thriller, but because it was written and directed by David Mamet, I expected something beyond that. It's too bad we should always judge Mamet by the standard of "Glengarry Glen Ross" or "House of Games," in which he really turns the klieg lights on the ugly underbelly of humanity. But since he's Mamet, it's unavoidable. He certainly makes some unlovely observations on the current state of political affairs in his tale of a coldly efficient, tough-as-nails Marine commando (Val Kilmer) sent on a mission to rescue the President's daughter from kidnappers. Mamet's script takes plenty of wild--but, in context, plausible--twists and turns, generating plenty of suspense, and the cast is impeccable. This is Kilmer's best performance since his "Tombstone" and "Doors" heyday, and it's great to see him again in a role worthy of his talents. But as good as this film is, its cynicism about the White House and the upper political echelon seems like business as usual after "The Pelican Brief" and "Clear and Present Danger." This is a very good movie, but with Mamet we've come to expect something great. It lacks his unique voice.</p></body></html>

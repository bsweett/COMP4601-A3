His humour just does not appeal to me. And I always get him & Adam Sandler muddled up. I swear they're the same guy. Why is it as well that they put a very bad wig and moustache on him, and do their best to make him look like a very bad porn star? Surely he didn't think he looked good?! And I have never seen a film with Vince Vaughn before. The only things I know about him is that he's very tall (and I'm very small, so I won't be standing next to him anytime soon), and he's rumoured to be dating Jennifer Aniston.<br /><br />Isn't Dodgeball a game you would play in primary school? Well, it certainly is now, with the influence of the game. I have to say I would have failed miserably at this game. I have no hand-to-eye co-ordination, and if I have to avoid something (like a ball coming flying at you), then I'd walk straight into it. And how many shots were there in the movie of a poor guy getting hit in the ... y'know? I'm not a guy, but have been told that the pain is indescribable, and you certainly do not get up straight afterwards, and carry on. Now, if I was crossing my legs during the film, what would an average guy be doing?! It's too scary to think about.<br /><br />Was it deliberate that extremely tall people surrounded Ben Stiller? Vince Vaughn must be well over 6ft, and there was also that guy who was "White's" right-hand-man, who's name sounded a lot like Michelle, he was big too. In fact, most of White's team was taller than him.<br /><br />I have to say compared to other reviews, which have compared this to Kingpin & Baseketball, I disagree. Mind you, I wasn't taken by both films (have I seen both?), and much prefer this movie.<br /><br />I loved Christine Taylor in this (Ben's real life wife! Awwwwwww), I was loving the braids, and the way she played against the stereotypical girl in this film. By the looks of some shots, she really went for it! Even if her hubby did break 3 cameras, and also hit her in the face. (I'll bet he was making up for that later.)<br /><br />The film is very fast-paced, and you'll be sitting on the edge of your seat for most of the film, trying not to bite your nails. There's also quite a few cameos, including absolute hilarious turns by David Hasselhoff & William Shatner. However, I didn't get the cameos by Lance Armstrong, Hank Azaria and who is Chuck Norris?<br /><br />The extras are quite reasonable, the gag reel is so funny! But the rest of it is just your usual bog-standard extras. Nothing special.<br /><br />I quite enjoyed this film, and had a good laugh with it. The wig Ben Stiller is wearing though is unforgivable however. Ugh. Poor Christine.<br /><br />I'm all caught up with my reviews now. xx</p></body></html>

Somehow they are able to communicate by letters put in the lake house mailbox, despite the fact that she is living two years in the future from his life.  The movie shows scenes of their separate lives, hers as a doctor and his as an architect.  Their paths cross in unexpected ways, some planned and some by accident.  The premise sounds ridiculous, but somehow these actors make it work and they create an aura that pulls in the audience.  This is recommended viewing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Crouching Oscar, Hidden Failure"></head><body><p>The only thing distinguishing this film from your average "D" quality Hong Kong kung-fu film is the state-of-the-art cinemtography and slightly above average directing. Apart from that, the screenplay is whimsical, the acting dull and shallow, and the script is inundated with those generic Confucian/Dao proverbs already overused in the 70's Kung-Fu series with David Caradine.<br /><br /> Yes, Chinese kung-fu cinema often has the characters floating in the air or doing other motions that defy the limitations of physics: this reflects their notion of how the channeling of chi through mental and physical concentration can overcome natural laws. Although I'm not disturbed with such reality gaps in film, I don't see why it would be worthy of an Oscar or the amount of praise it received. The screenplay presents a story that is just as absurd as the one for Rambo II where Rambo bravely defeats an entire entire North Vietnamese regiment using just a knife. Rambo II wasn't Oscar material and wouldn't have been Oscar material even if it had a better script, an added love story and enhanced cinematography: Why? Because the story line is generic and unimaginative. The same goes for Crouching Tiger: the story is essentially no different than every other generic kung-fu film coming out of Hong Kong. This is not to say that there aren't any good films coming out of China but, kung-fu films are essentially the Chinese equivalent of our Shwarzenneger or Stallone films. Have either of the latter actors or their action films won Oscars? No. So why should Crouching Tiger: just because it's foreign?<br /><br /> Check out 'Red Firecraker, Green Firecracker', 'Farewell My Concubine', and/or 'Raise The Red Lantern' for good Chinese drama; not this overhyped and revamped generic kung-fu fiasco.</p></body></html>

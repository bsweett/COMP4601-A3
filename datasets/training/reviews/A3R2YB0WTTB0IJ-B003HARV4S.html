<meta name="summary" content="NEIL BURGER, OPUS 2"></head><body><p>***** 2006. Adapted from a Steven Millhauser short story, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K7VHQ4">The Illusionist (Widescreen Edition)</a> was written and directed by Neil Burger. It's an outstanding love story in the Vienna of the early XXth century. Everything is perfect in this film: the production design, the actors, the Philip Glass musical score and the screenplay. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LC55F2">The Prestige</a> was the ultimate movie about magic, then came Neil Burger's masterpiece. What a wonderful year for movie lovers !</p></body></html>

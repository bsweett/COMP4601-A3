<meta name="summary" content="A Rich And Effective Biopic"></head><body><p>Doing film biopics can be very tricky. You can either come out with a tremendous success or an overconvulted film. With Milk, thankfully, it falls into the latter catagory, with a great script, masterful directing, and talented cast, it rises up as possibly one of the greatest film biopics ever.<br /><br />Havery Milk was the first openly gay man to enter public office and is considered an icon in the gay community. What he accomplished in the short span of his politic career could fill volumes. The film begins with Milk recording his life story, from his meeting with longtime lover Scott Smith, to their move to Castro street in '72, his run for office, the numerous people he meets, and of course his untimely death at the hands of a fellow politician.<br /><br />Out of all the award films that I have seen this year, Milk is really the only one that I felt really lived up to all the acclaim. Slumdog was great, so was Benjamin Button and The Dark Knight, The Reader was alright, as was Frost/Nixon, but Milk was truly that one film that really satisfied me. I would gladly say that Milk is hands down the best picture of 2008.<br /><br />Gus Van Sant has made arguably his best film, perfectly balancing all the emotions, sensitivity, and humor that everything just sort of flows across the screen and nothing feels to rushed or to slow. The screenplay by Dustin Lance Black perfectly encapsulates who Milk was as a person, warm, funny, stead fast, someone that you looked up to, no matter if you were gay or straight.<br /><br />The cast, in particular, does a great job, with the obvious standout of course being Sean Penn as Harvey Milk. Now I will admit, I am not a Sean Penn fan. There has just always been something about him that I just did not like. But with this role, he has really turned my opinions on him. The whole time I was watching the film, seeing him gave me nothing but joy, with no animosity or hatred at all felt towards him. He emobied so much of what Harvey Milk was as a person that you cannot believe that this tough as nails actor could play someone so opposite of who he normally potrays. Each of the supporting actors are also great as well, with Emile Hirsh, James Franco, and Josh Brolin being standouts. I will say that I don't agree with Brolin's Oscar nomination. Out of all the supporting roles, I think his is the most underwritten. If it were up to me, Hirsh would get the nomination and not Brolin.<br /><br />This is really a film that everyone should see, no matter what orientation you may be. And in the wakes of the recent Prop 8 vote in California, this film couldn't be even more relevant then ever. If there is any award movie you must see this year, Milk is that film. It will have you leaving the theater with a skip in your step and light in your heart.</p></body></html>

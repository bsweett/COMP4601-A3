<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant film, but what about some extras?"></head><body><p>This is great because it's in widescreen. The images are clear, the colours are bright, and this has the look of a restored version (or at least a good print). The R &amp; R Sherman songs never date and you will find modern children all over England and America singing along to Chim Chim Cheree and A Spoonful Of Sugar just as their parents did. David Tomlinson is both stuffy and loveable as Mr Banks, and Glynis Johns is wonderfully scatty as his wife. The two children are probably the least irritating in cinema history and were something of a casting coup for Disney, when compared with the horrid child actors in most of their output. But it is Dick Van Dyke who makes the film the fun it is. You can imagine, say a Petula Clark or a Diana Rigg as Mary Poppins, but only Van Dyke could play Bert the way he does. Leave aside the dodgy accent, and you're left with a great song and dance man who could carry the film even without the co-stars. The one disappointment is that there aren't any extras on this disc (I don't call scene selection a feature!).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Night At The Hostel"></head><body><p>Eli Roth (Cabin Fever) brings us another cool gorefest film. Only this time, it's torture. In this film, 3 guys (Hernandez, Richardson and Gudjonsson). are having a good time in Europe. But all that changes when a stranger tells them to go to a Hostel in another part of Europe to get girls.<br /><br />When they get stupid and go there, they meet 2 girls that set them up, and take them to a place where people are paid to torture and kill tourist.<br /><br />In real life, only a fool would fall for a trick like that. It seems to good to be true. But hey, it's a horror movie, can't have a horror movie without dumb victims. The gore in this film is awesome, but there's nothing unrated in this version. Even Roth himself said nothing much was cut.<br /><br />This is a good horror film to see, especially if you wanna have a bloody good time.</p></body></html>

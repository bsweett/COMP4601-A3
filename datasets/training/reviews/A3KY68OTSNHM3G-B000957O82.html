<meta name="summary" content="A Funny Romantic Comedy"></head><body><p>Will Smith stars in this funny film about dating and falling in love.  Smith stars as Alex "Hitch" Hitchens, the "Date Doctor".  He helps men find dates.  He has been rather successful at his work, as evidenced by the pictures of couples he helped get together hanging on his wall.  Hitch may have finally met his greatest challenge in Albert Brennaman (Kevin James).  Albert is a junior financial offecer who handles the account of heiress Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta).  Albert is desperate to have a relationship with Allegra, so he goes to Hitch for help.<br /><br />Hitch is skeptical at first, but he decides to try to help him.  This is the beginning of a friendship between Hitch and Albert.  Soon, Albert is going to fancy art galleries and New York Knicks games with Allegra.  Meanwhile, Hitch has found a woman that he likes.  Her name is Sara Melas (Eva Mendes).  She works as a newspaper gossip columnist. Hitch is immediately attracted to her, and the two begin dating.  In the meantime, Sara has seen the photos of Allegra and Albert that have been appearing in the papers.  Intrigued, Sara decides to do some investigationg of her own to find out why a socialite would be dating a junior accountant.<br /><br />What she finds out doesn't bode well for Hitch.  She finds out that he is indeed the infamous "Date Doctor".  Feeling hurt and betrayed, she breaks up with Hitch.  But is this really the end for them?  What will happen with Sara and Hitch and Allegra and Albert?<br /><br />This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in quite a while.  Will Smith was the perfect choice for the role of Hitch.  His funny disposition really makes the character shine.  Kevin James does an equally outstanding job as the bumbling but lovable Albert.  You can't help but root for him to get the seemingly unattainable "trophy girl".  Eva Mendes and Amber Valletta are also very good as Sara and Allegra.<br /><br />I recommend this movie very highly.  I'm a fan of Will Smith's music and movies, and he delivers perhaps his finest performance in this movie.  This is the perfect "date" movie, so if you're looking for something fun to do on date night, put this movie in, relax, and see a really great romantic comedy.</p></body></html>

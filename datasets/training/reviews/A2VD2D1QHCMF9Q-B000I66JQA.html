<meta name="summary" content="Sadness!"></head><body><p>These three women were looking for something that none of them found.  They needed unconditional love, and in that their three lives came together.  There is such a ubiquitous sadness, and it makes one wonder if it is possible to find some sense of happiness or fullfillment in one's life, or if it is just a chimera.  Running away or dissolving your identity into somone else's or just walking into a stream is not an end, and, unfortunately is not much of a beginning either.  Are we all destined for unhappy desperation . . great talent doesn't do it, neither does a conventional housewife's existence give answers, nor, apparently does caring for someone else.  Maybe life is a haphazard set of experiences leading downward, and ultimately to nothingness.</p></body></html>

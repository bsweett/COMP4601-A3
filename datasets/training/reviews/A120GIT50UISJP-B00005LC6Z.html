<meta name="summary" content="Not as strong as the original, but a solid entry in the Halloween series"></head><body><p>Picking up where Halloween left off, Laurie is taken to hospital while Dr. Loomis continues to search for Michael Myers. Drugged, traumatized and injured, Laurie nevertheless realizes that she is not safe and tries to escape from the hospital, exactly the place that Michael is headed, slashing his way through body after body to get to Laurie. Laurie displays the same resilience and resourcefulness that made Halloween such a groundbreaking movie, but her role is much smaller in this film. Donald Pleasance as Dr. Loomis gives another excellent performance as well.<br /><br />This movie could have been much better with a larger role for Laurie and some exploration of the relationship between Laurie and Michael, but it remains one of the few horror films in which a woman shows strength simply for her own survival, and not some feminine duty, like saving a child or lover. Overall, not as strong as the original, but one of the best entries in the Halloween franchise.</p></body></html>

Yessirree, Billy Bob, I come from West Virginia, home of the cinderblocked cars, extra tv satellites and inbred kinfolks.  This here movie sure skeered the pants off of me and my wife/sister, but I don't think it was filmed here in West Virginia...didn't see any Dale Earnhardt Jr. license plates.  Oh, well, WRONG TURN ought to keep furners out of our hills, and if it don't , you can stop by our hut for dinner.....we'd love to have ya!</p></body></html>

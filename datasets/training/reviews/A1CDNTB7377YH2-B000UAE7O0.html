<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining!"></head><body><p>Here is another entry into the spoof the Night of the Living Dead series.  This one is highly entertaining.  It is made like it is being shown in a cheap movie theater in the 70's with breaks in the film and coming attractions to other movies (they show a spoof called Machete).  Rose McGowan alone makes this movie as she is one of the sexiest looking stars in movies.  During the movie she loses a leg but her boyfriend later replaces it with a machine gun for which she then starts mowing down the zombies.  My only question is how did she fire that gun since it is attached to a hook on her leg stump?</p></body></html>

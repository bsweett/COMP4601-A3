<meta name="summary" content="Where they have gone before..."></head><body><p>I have only just seen this movie, partly because I began to lose interest after Insurrection, and partly because of the overall negative reviews.<br /><br />However, Nemesis is certainly worth watching, even if it is a little formulaic; although there are a number of questionables, many of which have been pointed out by other fans.<br /><br />For me, the recurring idiocy is the idea of being defenseless against a cloaked ship. Hello, the second the ship fired, even a modern-day military computer and radar system could pinpoint the exact source of the shot, and provide counterattack coordinates to the ship under fire. Even if you can't see the ship, you can see the point of emanation.<br /><br />As for using up all of the photon torpedoes in a single relatively brief engagement; as another fan pointed out, this is simply ridiculous.<br /><br />Please watch the movie and make up your own mind. It's better than Insurrection, but not a 'great' movie, like First Contact or any of the Classic Trek epics.<br /><br />There's certainly the possibility of a sequel built into the ending, but after the disappointing box office for Nemesis, they will need to be very sure they have a winner before they put anything else together. Especially since the sequel would be an odd-numbered movie...</p></body></html>

This film took some of the most important and emotional events of the 20th century and trivialized them.  Not to mention the fact that it gives the unthinking viewer the idea  that stupidity works.<p>I'm not in favor of book or movie burning but if I  could destroy every copy I would.  If there is a more dangerous movie than  this one I hope I never see it.</p></body></html>

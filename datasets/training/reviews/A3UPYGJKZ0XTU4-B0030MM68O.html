<meta name="summary" content="Dramatizing the Defining Feature of the Iraq War: EOD Techs in Search of IEDs."></head><body><p>Journalist Mark Boal was imbedded with explosive ordinance disposal (EOD) technicians, AKA a bomb squad, in Iraq in 2004, where he observed the stresses and perils of Iraq War at its most bloody. Improvised explosive devices (IEDs) are the defining characteristic of the Iraq War, and that was during their peak, when EOD units saw a lot of action. Director Kathryn Bigelow asked Boal to write a fictional script based on his observations. "The Hurt Locker" follows a three-man EOD unit called Bravo Company for the last five weeks of its rotation in Iraq. The team's leader is the new guy, a brazen but highly skilled adrenaline junkie, SSG Will James (Jeremy Renner). He clashes with the professional, even-tempered Sgt. JT Sanborn (Anthony Mackie), while the younger Spc. Owen Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) has a hard time coping with the death around him.<br /><br />"The Hurt Locker" was shot in a documentary style, always using four cameras with different views on the action, so the 44-day shoot in Jordan produced a million feet of film. Don't worry. It's all edited down quite nicely. The downside is that there is camera shake, a style that seems to have taken over contemporary cinema. The advantage is that Barry Ackroyd's cinematography and Kathryn Bigelow's direction bring out the drama inherent in the high-stress, do-or-die situations without seeming to try. Their approach to the material is almost prosaic. This is a day in the life of the bomb squad. And then another day, etc. It is always suspenseful, because diffusing bombs is inherently suspenseful. It is always dramatic, because these men must cope with extreme circumstances, and they do so differently, which can make them uneasy with one another.<br /><br />Bigelow cast the lead roles with actors who would not be immediately recognizable. We don't have any particular expectations of them, which augments the film's sense of immediacy. We don't' know ahead of time how anyone is going to react to the constantly shifting emotional landscape. But we get a few surprises when more recognizable actors show up in smaller roles. It's a nice touch. And the cast is terrific. Though there is plenty of action (and realistic explosions, not the kind that make pretty orange plumes), "The Hurt Locker" is very much a character drama. Three people react to war as they see it and to each other. It's not a political film. It doesn't comment on the wisdom, or not, of the Iraq War. It doesn't tell the audience who to see as hero, villain, or victim. But "The Hurt Locker" does give the impression that this is the reality of 21st century warfare.<br /><br />The DVD (Summit 2010): Bonus features are a making-of documentary, image gallery with audio, and a feature commentary. "The Hurt Locker: Behind the Scenes" (12 min) interviews Kathryn Bigelow and Mark Boal, cast, and some creative crew about the films genesis, characters, the director's style, and the cinematography. The "Image Gallery" is a slideshow of behind-the-scenes photos with audio from a Q&A with Bigelow and Boal at the Institute of Contemporary Art in London. So it gives us something to look at while we listen to the Q&A. The audio commentary, again with director Kathryn Bigelow and writer Mark Boal, is informative and constant. They discuss the locations, cast, filming in Jordan, the explosions, and Boal contributes some observations from his time in Iraq. Subtitles available for the film in English SDH and Spanish. Dubbing available in Spanish.</p></body></html>

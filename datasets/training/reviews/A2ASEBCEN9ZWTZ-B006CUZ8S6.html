"Sorcerer's Stone" went on to be the biggest worldwide hit of 2001 (and of all time next to Titanic) due in large part to the popularity of J.K. Rowling's hit series of books that it was based on, but as a film it easily stood up on its own merits combining the right amount of action, eye candy FX, humor and "whodunit" mystery intrigue.  "Chamber of Secrets" keeps the tradition going, and then some!<p>THE STORY:<p>"Chamber of Secrets" is the adaptation of J.K. Rowling's second book in the landmark Harry Potter series, the story of a boy wizard who through a twist of fate is locked in mortal combat with an evil wizard.  The series follows his (and his buddies Ron and Hermione's) (mis)adventures as they progress through 7 years of study at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  Chamber of Secrets chronicles their adventures during their 2nd year at school where Harry becomes the prime suspect in a string of deadly attacks against his fellow classmates as the mysterious Chamber of Secrets has been opened.  What exactly is the "Chamber of Secrets" and if it wasn't Harry who opened it, who did?<p>THE COOL THINGS:<p>All the stunning visual eye candy from "Sorcerer's Stone" is back, bigger and badder than ever! The world of Hogwarts is once again depicted just as grand as before, if not more so.  For fans of the first movie the revamped Quidditch scene will hit you harder than before like a psychotic Bludger.  Also, the addition of the new "wizard duel" scene will strike you just as hard as any of the Lightsaber battles of Star Wars fame.  Overall, if you're an FX freak you'll love CoS as much as SS, if not more.<p>The actor's performances in this film are just brilliant.  Rupert Grint's Ron Weasley and Kenneth Branagh's Gilderoy Lockheart as well as the Jason Isaac's Lucius Malfoy and Dobby the House Elf easily steal the show and bring Rowling's depictions to life just as you'd imagine it.<p>BEST SCENES:<p>- Wizards duel<p>- Quidditch Match<p>- Flying car<p>- Harry vs. The "Secret" in the Chamber<p>THE ADAPTATION:<p>Fans of the books will once again (or at least should) be pleased with this very true and near perfect translation of book to silver screen.  Like the first movie, very little was changed from the book with just a few "minor" deletions of scenes or "rearrangements" from the book.  Once again, as movie adaptations of books go, the Harry Potter movies are almost as perfect as you'll get.<p>WARNINGS:<p>Readers of the books should know what kinds of things to watch out for in this one.  For the somewhat squeamish there are scenes with slugs, spiders, giant snakes and a few other things that may upset you that you'll want to look out for or be mindful of if you are bringing very young children.<p>THE VERDICT:<p>Overall, once again, if you are a fan of the series (or even if you are not), "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" should easily top the list of movies you should definitely see.  Fans of the book will appreciate seeing everything come to life and fans of great movies will marvel at all the action, humor and visual eye candy this one has to offer.<p>Can't wait for the "Prisoner of Azkaban" movie and the Chamber of Secrets DVD.<p>Highest Recommendation. (Like you didn't know...)</p></body></html>

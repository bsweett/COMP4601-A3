<meta name="summary" content="A Winner:  A 21st Century Classic!"></head><body><p>A fascinating early 21st century fable and one of the most beautiful American movies to come along in ages. Michael Gondry is blessed with a cast that seems to have trusted his direction and was equally responsive to every idea presented, and fearless executing every moment.<br /><br />Jim Carrey is offered his best role to date and he not only doesn't disappointment he proves himself to be me more than clownish cartoon characters he too frequently (and easily) settles into.  It is a remarkably affecting and touching performance.<br /><br />Kate Winslet is once again the chameleon and her Clementine while initially straightforward and uncomplicated beguilingly shows how many facets this character has behind her.  It's a fascinating portrait.<br /><br />The remainder of the ensemble, the art direction, sound and every other aspect of this movie set a standard for the new century.  I hope we're up to it!</p></body></html>

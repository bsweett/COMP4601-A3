The story centers around a Texas high school football team and their hopes for a state championship win. Trouble ensues when star player Boobie (how'd he get that name?) injures his leg. Pretty good performances and scary to think that people can get so carried away with a game that it rules their lives. Then again, this is Texas so what else do they have to do with themselves?</p></body></html>

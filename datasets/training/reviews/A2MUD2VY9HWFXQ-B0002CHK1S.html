"The Thing" is John Carpenters masterpiece!<br /><br />I watched this movie fore the first time last night; alone, in my darkened basement and it scared the living hella outta me! This movie ROCKS!<br /><br />Somehow, "The Thing" always eluded me. I never knew much about it and never really had an interest in it until I started doing a little research on the internet of horror/sci-fi movies I had not seen.<br /><br />First off, "The Thing" holds up marvelously 23 years after its release! In fact, this movie could probably be re-released today and make a ton of money. It's just THAT good. With so many of our classic horror movies being re-made these days; this is one re-make that was done right and at a time when re-makes weren't being mass produced (as they are in today's market).<br /><br />Well written, acted, & shot, "The Thing" is one heck of a gore fest. The graphic violence in the "The Thing" is just amazingly shocking, realistic, and awesome!<br /><br />Quick plot summary:<br /><br />A US research team working in the Antarctic comes across a Norwegian base that has been deserted. They find a dead and deformed body and take it back for research. The end up learning that something has attacked the Norwegians and is somehow shape-shifting with detailed precision into a predatory killer. By researching the evidence left behind by the Norwegians, they find a space ship that looks like it crashed in the snow some time ago.<br /><br />They soon realize they are being stalked, and it could be anyone of the team. They began to lose all trust and confidence in each other and quickly began to turn against their colleagues.<br /><br />Will they find WHO amongst them is the "Thing"?<br />Can anyone kill this creature before it wipes them all out and infects our entire civilization?<br /><br />Kurt Russel rounds out a very nice cast of actors in this fantastic thrill ride. I was very impressed and satisfied with John Carpenter's "The Thing".<br /><br />I cant recommend this movie enough!  Enjoy!!</p></body></html>

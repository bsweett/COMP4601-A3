In fact, this is one of those films that leaves the viewer with baited breath, constantly wrapping us around its tightly woven finger to keep us engaged and engrossed, thoroughly.<br /><br />That said, this is not a film that ages remarkably well.  Yes, it remains entertaining and exciting, but upon reflection it becomes easy to point out the flaws.<br /><br />It isn't as smart as I remembered it being.<br /><br />Still, there is little not to like about this film.  Yes, it is violent and littered with profanities, but if you know anything about this movie then you should know what you are walking into and so you really have no room to complain about those things.  This is a gritty cop movie filled with drugs and gangsters and death; and the trailer alone kind of made that evident.<br /><br />The film follows a rookie cop named Jake as he gets a taste of the job from his new partner, Alonzo Harris.  Alonzo is a rough and tumble cop who is apparently crooked.  The job has hardened him, making him ruthless and corruptible.  Jake has not yet been manipulated by his profession.  He is still green and his naivety makes him an easy (allegedly) target for Alonzo's games.  As their day together escalates, things happen that set off a series of alarms in Jake's head.  This is not going to be your typical day on the job.  As the day draws to a close it becomes apparent that Alonzo has had a lot more than just work on his mind, and soon violence spreads like a plague over this newfound, explosive partnership.<br /><br />For me, this film is intensely edited and directed to capture your interest and hold it firmly in its grip.  Each scene is manipulated in a way to keep us glued.  This is a blessing, but upon reflection it also seems like a curse.  The film dissolves into nothing more than a series of scenes; no real moving plot just exciting moments strung together.  When it does try to form a plot it winds up becoming a tad too far fetched for its own good.  It works solely because of the pacing and the performances.  If left on its own right the film would have fallen apart.<br /><br />Those performances (or the two that matter) are beautifully compatible.  For me, this is easily Ethan Hawkes movie.  So much love and flattery has been showered on Denzel Washington for his performance here, but that is only because it is flashy and baity.  Honestly, Hawke had the harder character to formulate, someone who is suppressed in his own convictions as he observes and reacts to the outlandish behavior of someone he cannot trust yet needs to in order to survive.  He has to make his subtle performance equal Washington's flamboyant one or else he suffers becoming overshadowed and thus forgotten.  I'm so glad he got the Oscar nomination, even if it was in the wrong category (how in the world was he supporting?).  Denzel is very good here, if not a tad over the top.  He nails a lot of scenes (the introduction scene in the diner is still one of my favorite moments in film this entire decade) but he also goes overboard a few times.  He runs that fine line between intense and hammy.<br /><br />Hawke wins.<br /><br />In the end I give this a solid B+.  I still think that the script is the films weakest link.  It has a nice contrast of morality at play here, and it had the potential to really tap into that concept (and it does to a degree) but the overall plot just doesn't stand up on its own.  It works far better as a concept than an actual story.  That said, the fresh take on direction and the solid performances make this a must see film, and one that you will surely enjoy.</p></body></html>

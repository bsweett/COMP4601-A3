<meta name="summary" content="Was Good"></head><body><p>Though Foster is featured prominently on the cover, this movie really stars Washington and Owen, with Foster appearing not nearly long enough.  This was a clever and well thought out movie.  A bank robbery that is not all that it should be with Owen leading the thieves and Washington as the detective in charge of the negotiations.  A cat and mouse game between the two ensues, and you never really know who will come out on top.  Though the ending was satisfying, it fell a little short of being a surprise, shock or a feel good type of conclusion.  Very good acting highlights this movie.  I might watch this one again to see if I missed anything the first time around, but I am not sure if I will purchase it.</p></body></html>

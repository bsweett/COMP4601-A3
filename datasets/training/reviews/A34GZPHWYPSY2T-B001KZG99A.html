Not just that: today's crummy offerings (mostly involving silly brainless teens falling into comic books or video-/Hasbro-based schlock) suck beyond all recognition. That is why IRON MAN takes the prize in my book.<br /><br />As most of my generation and the following two, I grew up reading comics. Of all, Marvel Comics were my favorites. It is a thrill each time a Marvel character is done justice. In IRON MAN, nothing disappoints. In spite of today's grand cine-tech, this is a seamless, superbly executed work of art.<br /><br />Featuring the dramedy-slapstick talents of Robert Downey, a growling villain in the form of Jeff Bridges, we have as a perfect spice the support of Gwyneth Paltrow and Terence Howard. This film will show you what "supporting role" is supposed to mean.<br /><br />Though there are multinational (presumably Muslim) terrorists, who give Tony Stark his Iron Man initiative, this film is lighthearted, fun, never overbearing and funny as hell. Thanks to this, Downey got offered Sherlock Holmes, and IRON MAN really is his 'comeback'. He reins in Tony Stark's pathos and gives us a strong, determined man who is not afraid to grow. Jeff Bridges' villain shows the opposite side of that coin brilliantly.<br /><br />I loved hearing Paul Bettany's sexy voice as Stark's computer Jervis, and the inventions, gadgetry, even weapons were a fantastic treat. When I think of the hatchet job done by Christian Bale to BATMAN....<br /><br />Here, IRON MAN is overtly political but not in any patronizing, annoying way. Stan Lee has always been 'political' marching to his own drummer's beat, and this movie reflects that better than any other I've seen so far. Political can only take you so far: the rest had better be entertaining and just plain good. And IRON MAN IS GOOD!!<br /><br />Now that its sequel is floating around, get and enjoy this unique film. There are explosions, but everything looks and feels so new here. That is a level of skill I just don't see anymore. Samuel L. Jackson gives the perfect "this-is-about-to-get-big" cameo at the end, and I nearly jumped out of my seat at that promise--which I can only hope has been delivered as well as this delivered.<br /><br />IRON MAN will be a classic, mark my words.</p></body></html>

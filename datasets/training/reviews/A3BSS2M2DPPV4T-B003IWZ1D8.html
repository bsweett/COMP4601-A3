<meta name="summary" content="STILL GIVES VIEWERS THE CREEPS!"></head><body><p>Although this landmark Hitchcock film is over 4O years old, it still manages to instill the shudders!  Many factors contribute to this fact.  The performances are first-rate, especially that of Anthony Perkins: he was forever identified with this role (is it any wonder?) and Perkins was practically type-cast as movie audiences relished savouring his playing of demented Norman Bates.  The black and white photography is another factor towards the film's perennial success.  If this had been filmed in colour, it wouldn't have nearly the intended impact.  Thirdly, there is the classic, terrificly creepy musical score by Bernard Herrmann which is, in a word, unforgettable.  Janet Leigh is natural and effective in her playing of Marion Crane: when she takes off with that $4O,OOO, the audience goes right along for the ride!  Even Hitchcock's daughter, Pat, is cleverly cast as the receptionist at the Phoenix bank, and she somehow lingers in the memory - definitely a Hitchcockian touch: we remember &quot;Teddy&quot; and &quot;aspirin&quot;.  Handsome John Gavin is a bit wooden as Sam, but then so is Vera Miles as Lila (is that a wig she's wearing?): they seem destined to be together after the fade-out. Even as a kid, I thought the bedroom of Mrs. Bates was grotesque: hearts, artificial flowers, cupids and all - and that imprint on the bed....ugh!! The scenes in the Bate's motel office are brilliantly acted in every respect: with Leigh, Gavin and Balsam respectively.  As Arbogast, Martin Balsam is memorably honest in his playing and his death scene is particularly jolting. Concerning Lila, Sam &amp; Marion's whereabouts,  I love the scene where Arbogast says to Lila &quot;...but I don't believe you&quot; - Lila replies thusly: &quot;I don't care whether YOU believe me or NOT!!&quot;  When Mrs. Bates appears to be very much alive according to Lila, John McIntire is memorable as the gruff but essentially tender-hearted sheriff.  Eerily, he questions just who is buried in her plot in the local cemetery? - which gives the film an obviously intentional &quot;false twist&quot;  Lurene Tuttle, that great veteran character actress plays the sheriff's wife who insists that Mrs. Bate's was buried in a dress of &quot;periwinkle blue&quot; (!). Most every horror fan knows that Leigh (and thousands of women) refrained form taking showers after seeing this film upon its initial release in 196O.  Janet Leigh's &quot;blood&quot; was actually Hershey's chocolate syrup going &quot;down the drain&quot;!  The Joseph Stefano script is - if not brilliant - interesting: it was adapted from the novel by Robert Bloch.  Said to be inspired from one Edward Gein, an eccentric Wisconsin bachelor who, after his domineering mother died, went &quot;psycho&quot; in his secluded isolation. Creepy.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Fantastic - Worth Seeing More than Once"></head><body><p>This futuristic film about a to the letter "cleric" (similar to 'the cleaner') who suddenly finds himself going against everything he has known.<br /><br />There is no more war in a society that is without emotion thanks to a handy dandy drug that sounds an awful lot like Prozac. All things that stir emotions, literature, art, music, color are banned and those who are caught not taking their medication or collecting emotional paraphernalia pay for it with their lives. But there is an underground movement willing to risk it.<br /><br />One day John (Christian Bale) breaks a vile of his medication and ends up not replacing the daily dosage. This leads to another day, and another day until finally he's hiding his dosages and killing his teammates to protect "sensors" (people who've stopped taking their medication and are feeling again) and lost puppies.<br /><br />It sounds a little hokey but it is an awesome movie. Beautifully shot action scenes as well as dramatic scenes. The child who plays John's son is perfect as the emotionless child willing to turn in friend or family. The film does have reminders of other movies but it really doesn't take anything away from this film.<br /><br />It was nice to see guest appearances by Angus Macfadyen (Braveheart), Sean Bean (Lord of the Rings), William Fichtner (Prison Break), Taye Diggs (Private Practice) and Emily Watson (Punch-Drunk Love).<br /><br />This is going to be one of repeat viewing movies and is a must see film for any futurists or Christian Bale fans.</p></body></html>

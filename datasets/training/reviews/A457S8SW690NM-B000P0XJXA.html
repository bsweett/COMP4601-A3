<meta name="summary" content="This is Val Kilmer's movie!"></head><body><p>I just rented this movie and really enjoyed it. It's a movie that I strongly recommend to everyone, whether it be a rental or a buy. This is the best Val Kilmer movie in my opinion. Kilmer is a talented actor but most of the movies that he is in are average. He was good as Batman, but the movie sucked. This movie is a good drama movie that is a thriller. It has suspensful moments, shocking moments and puzzling moments. This is one movie that requires the viewer's complete attention. If you don't, you'll be confused probably.<br /><br />This movie is about a kidnapping of a very important girl. Val Kilmer plays a special ops guy who is assigned to help search for her. But, this case is complicated with betrayals and lots more. The movie is compelling and exciting and a fun movie to watch.<br /><br />I see mixed reviews on Amazon but don't understand them at all. Ignore them as this is one excellent movie that got a rave review by Roger Ebert. And rightfully so!!!!!! Check this one out as it is a surprisingly good movie that is one of the better ones of the past 5 years.<br /><br />Keep an eye out for William H. Macy who delivers a strong performance in a small role! Rent this, buy it, do what ever you want. But just make sure you watch it!</p></body></html>

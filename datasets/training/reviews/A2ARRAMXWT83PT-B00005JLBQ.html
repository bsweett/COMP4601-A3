<meta name="summary" content="AWESOME FILM!"></head><body><p>This is one of the best films of the summer, and should win every Oscar that it gets nominated for. All of the performances were superb, the direction, the music by Thomas Newman, everything about this movie was great! It was a wonderful father/son story. Tom Hanks has out done himself again. He is a great actor, and should win another Oscar. Paul Newman was great, too! I loved this movie. I have seen it twice already.<p>Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

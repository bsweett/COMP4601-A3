<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant, and a Very Revealing DVD"></head><body><p>I saw this in the cinema when it came out. Absolutely enthralling.<br /><br />This film is extraordinarily well-crafted. Not done on a colossal budget, but it stands up to many films of the period VERY well ( compare this with HELL HOUSE , and you can see the difference in scare value, as well as the quality of this film).<br /><br />In terms of content, the film has Priests in it who said that the various scenes most critics rail against as Blasphemous, are perfectly legitimate in context.<br /><br />The really  chilling element that I have found bugs some people out , is that the Director uses some REAL  audio from an actual exorcism to beef up the presence of the demonic sounds.<br /><br />If you are going to do a film on this genre, general topic area, then using the right material makes a big difference. This film does not make the mistake of making up its own "occult"  material like some recent films do.<br /><br />This is a perpetual classic that shows just how a well made film will stand the test of time, small minded critics, and quality scripts ... however much the Director has to beef it up with cool ideas :-)<br /><br />Great version .... also , get the 25th Anniversary  edition for some great , and insightful  extras.</p></body></html>

Pretty sad<br /><br />to hear ole Harrison being harangued by the juvenile story of<br /><br />this movie.  Firewall was a fire sale of eigth grade ideas about technology and suspense.  The bad guys seem totally inept<br /><br />and there were about a hundred ways Harrison could have given them false info, retracted the info, notified the police, etc etc.  Anyways, bascially it is the kidnap dilemna, do you concede to the ransom or call in the cops, not much suspense.<br /><br />The movie just gets worse as it goes along, until the down right<br /><br />laughable ending. The last 15 minutes were straight out of a macho mexican western.  Old and decrepit Han Solo was brawling<br /><br />as the script ran out of ideas, reminding me of Star Wars: Episode 1 - The Phantom Premise.  This movie is bad...and sad.</p></body></html>

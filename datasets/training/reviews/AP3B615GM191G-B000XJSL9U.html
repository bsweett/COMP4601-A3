<meta name="summary" content="A Crisis Worthy Of John McClane"></head><body><p>Bruce Willis (and the Die Hard franchise he perpetuated) will always be judged next to the other famous action franchises of the 1980s, such as "Rocky", "Rambo", & "The Terminator".  While all those series got re-booted in the 2000s, they also contained a heavy dose of nostalgia for the past.  In "Live Free or Die Hard", however, it is "full steam ahead" with little time for remembrance.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Live Free" sees John McClane (Willis) pulled into another tense criminal situation when villain Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Oliphant) executes an event of cyber-terrorism severe enough to bring Washington to its knees.  Along with "hack-boy" Matt Farrell (Justin Long), McClane sets out to find the perpetrators and bring them some 1980s-style justice.<br /><br />This film really works primarily due to airtight direction & pacing.  Director Len Wiseman never lets the pace flag whatsoever.  When the action dies down, the wisecracks & humor ramps up.  Suffice it to say that there is never a boring moment what with all the action, chases, explosions, technology, & typical Willis humor.<br /><br />The main plot ("cyber-terrorism") also serves to usher McClane into the 21st century.  McClane's old-school justice provides a nice counterpoint to the tech-nerd played by Long (who is actually, on a rare occasion, watchable in this effort).<br /><br />Actually, the only negative thing I can say about this movie is that I almost wished it would have harkened back to the themes of the original even perhaps a bit more.  There is a subplot involving the daughter of McClane, but little more is mentioned (besides a few "easter egg moments") regarding the original Die Hard trilogy.<br /><br />Overall, though, "Live Free" is a great addition to the Die Hard cannon (already better than parts two & three).  For an action-oriented film, it really holds its weight.</p></body></html>

The animation is typically fine Dreamworks stuff, though I wish I'd seen this in 3D in theaters, as many shots are clearly set up to highlight those effects, and while they look fine in 2D, it's clear that we're missing another semi-dimension. But that's no big deal, as the film is in general quite winning.<br /><br />The voice work is all good, with Gerard Butler the most convincing. I really liked Toothless' look, and the highlight of the film is the boy-and-his-dragon aspect; it's always kind of funny when animation makes you tear up a bit. But anyone who's ever really loved an animal friend knows how that goes.<br /><br />The blu-ray transfer is quite good, though not quite as amazingly crisp as Up or Kung Fu Panda. There are a few extras, a brief doc on the voices, but it's not an especially great BD package, merely decent.<br /><br />All in all, a very good-looking, heartfelt movie, one of the best animated films of 2010 that I've seen.</p></body></html>

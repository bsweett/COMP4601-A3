<meta name="summary" content="Lightweight Fun, But Souless (pun intended)"></head><body><p>Nothing great about this latest comic book transfer to film, but it is, overall, enjoyable.  The effects are fun and the story moves along at a nice pace, but the acting is rather pedestrian although I always enjoy seeing Eva Mendez, who seems to have a lot of trouble buttoning her shirts in any film she's in, and Nick Cage who gives us another of his quirky, "I know this is stupid stuff but I'm having fun", performances.  It's also nice to see Peter Fonda (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RYUU">Easy Rider</a>) who is nicely sinister here and Sam Elliot (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00023P4U6">The Legacy</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007KGCT">Hulk</a>) who is always good to see.  Sam has always had a great narrative voice and his world-weary voice and appearance works very well in this particular film. Some may remember him from the days when he and Tom Selleck, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002VF6CO">Magnum, P.I.</a>, co-stared in a number of memorable TV-Westerns (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EOTUSK">Louis L'Amour's The Sacketts</a>) together back in the 80's.<br /><br />Although no one does any memorable acting here, they do pull off this lightweight entertainment effectively enough.  Relative newcomer Raquel Alessi who plays Eva Mendez's character in her youth is innocently charming and believable.  Expect to see more of her in the future.<br /><br />Just as the acting is nothing special in this film, I also found that this film doesn't really have any great memorable moments that stand out.  I can't say anything like, "there's this great scene where  . . ." or "I was blown away when . . ."  The film was rather empty and forgettable, but still fun.  I did end up buying this DVD when it came out as it is simple popcorn entertainment, but I find it rather humorous that there are 2 and 3 disk "special editions" of this film as if it were some kind of epic like Peter Jackson's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H30B2C">King Kong - Extended Cut (Three-Disc Deluxe Edition)</a>.  Maybe the producers knew we wouldn't buy multiple editions of this flick like we might invest in true epics so they gave us everything in one shot (not that we needed it -- I purchased the single disk widescreen version and that is enough for this film).</p></body></html>

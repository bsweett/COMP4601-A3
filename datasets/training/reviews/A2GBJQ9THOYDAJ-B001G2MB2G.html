<meta name="summary" content="This film definitely has problems"></head><body><p>This is the first in the series I wasn't able to see first at the theater, which I try to do with any film that promises large quantities of SFX. But I just never found the time. As it turned out, I caught all the glitz just fine on my large-ish TV. It was the dialogue that gave me trouble. From the very first scene, the actors seemed to mumble more than half their lines and I'm sure I missed a lot of the by-play. And since I haven't read the novels (Yet. Maybe.), I didn't even know what I was missing. But my wife, who has read them all at least twice, assures me that was much, much more that ought to have been said about Neville's parents, and about the revolt of George & Fred, and that there's a great deal more to say about Luna Lovegood and Sybil Trelawney, etc. I know it's the fattest of the seven Harry Potter books, and I'm perfectly aware that any good screenplay based on a novel is obliged to discard many of the subplots, but even so, two hours and a quarter apparently just wasn't enough, so they had to zip past a lot of important information. I shall have to get hold of the screenplay and read along when I rewatch the film -- and I will.</p></body></html>

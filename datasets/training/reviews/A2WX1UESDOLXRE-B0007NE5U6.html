<meta name="summary" content="Not As Good As First, But Still Funny Second Time Around"></head><body><p>Some of this movie does feel like a re-hash. But that's okay, since the movie was great the first time around, I don't mind seeing some of the same stuff again. This time around, we join Bridget, as she's right in the middle of her relationship with sexy lawyer Mark Darcy (Colin Firth). She's still at her TV job, making a fool of herself (remember the hilarious fireman's pole thing from the first??!! Similar situation in this one...).<br /><br />Bridget is getting worried because it seems that Mark might have a love interest at work. Of course, Bridget is just jumping to all the wrong conclusions. She gets pretty low, then gets a job to go to Thailand and film a sort of tourist guide. Guess who is working there too? And at the same job and company because her boss told her that they needed a male personality? That's right. Daniel (Hugh Grant). Unlike Mark, Daniel really is a skeez. Will she go back with Daniel, who feeds her compliments and tells her what a fool he's been? Or will she get back with Mark? Obvious answer. The movie got a little weird for me (I actually thought she had to be dreaming at first because I couldn't believe it) when Bridget is sent to a Thai prison. Yeah.<br /><br />Overall, though, this is a funny movie. It'd be fun just to take a Saturday night with your girlfriends and watch both movies in a row, feeling bad, then happy, bad, then happy right along with Bridget. I don't care if I've seen some of this movie before in the first. It was funny the first time. Why wouldn't it be the second time?? RECOMMMENDED!!</p></body></html>

Hence I passed on it when it was in theaters and I waited this long to finally watch it On Demand. Turns out that Moneyball is the best movie that I've watched so far this year.<br /><br />The movie adapts Michael Lewis's 2003 book of the same name and is the story of how Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane took the team from the sound of losing to the roar of winning. Brad Pitt plays Beane and Jonah Hill plays assistant GM Peter Brand, and both were masterfully casted for the roles.<br /><br />I've heard the endless criticism that Brad Pitt is successful only because he's a pretty boy, and I have to ask: what the heck is that all about? Pitt is excellent in Moneyball and at times I felt like I was watching a video documentary of the actual Oakland A's back-office for most of the movie. Pitt can act, and Hill seamlessly stepped away from comedy for this dramatic role. The rest of the cast was great too; I thought that Philip Seymour Hoffman really was A's Manager Art Howe.<br /><br />The movie runs a little long at about 2 and a quarter hours, but the time went fast and it felt shorter than that. So that's a good thing. There's really not a lot more to say here other than to reiterate that what may seem like a boring movie on the surface is actually an uplifting, compelling movie that entertained me from start to finish. May not be a collector's item, but it's certainly worth a spot in the top of your viewing queue. Check it out.</p></body></html>

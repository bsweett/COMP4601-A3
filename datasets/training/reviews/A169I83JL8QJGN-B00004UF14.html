<meta name="summary" content="Summer fun in a great DVD package"></head><body><p>One thing I hate is when studios put out multiple versions of the same movie and each package contains different features. New Line Cinema is doing this with Lord of the Rings. The same was done with Men in Black. Thankfully, with MIB most of the special features that were on the single disk version were included on the dual disk version, so I don't think I missed anything. However yet another version of this DVD is in the works. I'll be sticking with what I've already bought.<br /> The movie itself is your typical summer blockbuster. It may not set new standards in story telling, but it is certainly a lot of fun with some good looking CGI special effects, something that's becoming a rarity these days. The acting in the movie is probably the most fun, especially the villain of the movie, and Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are great. The movie may be lacking in depth, but it is supposed to be an action comedy. So this is excusable. This film is worth the purchase, and the load of special features are more than enough to keep fans of the summer blockbuster genre busy for hours on end.</p></body></html>

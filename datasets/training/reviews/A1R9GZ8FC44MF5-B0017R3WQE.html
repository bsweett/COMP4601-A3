<meta name="summary" content="Rap Sucks, This movie Doesn't."></head><body><p>This movie is talked about by alot of rappers, because they think their cool trying be tough and some actually think Al is cuban.  In truth this movie is not about who is the baddest, who does the most drugs, and kills the most people, this is a real movie a crime drama directed by a good director.  Its got one hell of a performance by Al, who by the way is Italian, and nobody else can deliver the line "say hello to my little friend" like he can.  Its got some good gangster action, the chainsaw scene and the last shootout.  Its got a good story, its got drama, its got some humor, and some pretty good cinematography like in the riot.  Overall is a very good movie, not one of the best, but its definetly an entertaining experience, i give it a 9 out of a 10.  I would just like to say that rap is terrible and soon i hope it will be gone it is ruining the music industry, and anyone who only likes this movie because rappers think its the hot good needs to be shot.</p></body></html>

It remains Mel Gibson's crowning achievement.  While certain details of the story are suspect, the arching narrative is so powerful and affecting, it's hard not to become enveloped inside.  The characters are wonderful and the cinematography is among the best in film history.<p>This DVD offers a nice round of extras for the film buff, lots of commentary and trailers-the standard fare.  This is an essential DVD for all film libraries.  As an aside, I find inspiration in Gibson's character.  I'm sure many guys want to have the convictions and strength of William Wallace.  I am no exception.  I try to live by his famous line &quot;Every man dies, not every man really lives.&quot;<p>Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An excellent 'road trip' movie"></head><body><p>"The Motorcycle Diaries" is one of my favorite movies from 2004. Lyrical and insightful, it is one of the best `road trip' movies of all time.<br /><br />It is 1952. Two medical students from Caracas, Venezualia, Ernesto [Gael Garcia Bernal] and Alberto [Rodrigo De la Serna] are about to go on a trip on an old motorcycle through the heart of South America. What they encounter is a South America far different from their comfortable middle-class upbringing. Intellectually, they know what they will see. The gut response is far different, especially for Ernesto.<br /><br />Gael Garcia Bernal is one of the great actors of our generation. He gives to Ernesto a great meaning and presence.<br /><br />"The Motorcycle Diaries" is based on a true story. Alberto went on to become a famous doctor in Cuba. Alberto became Che Guevara. If you don't know who he was, forget this movie.</p></body></html>

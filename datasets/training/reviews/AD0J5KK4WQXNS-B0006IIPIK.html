With that said and done the art value of Sky Captain is quite high, although certainly not the near perfect CGI as we have seen many years ago in a similar teenage movie "Final Fantasy", which did it better, but the story was not really there either, whereas Sky Captain has live action actors in with the CGI, doesn't really end up doing that much for it in the end considering that the best thing in this offering is the sexy/funny/action heroine character that Angelina Jolie plays for the ten minutes she is in it and not the dumb blond character of Gwyneth Paltrow actually playing a dumb blond and obviously hating every second of it because Jude Law gets to blame absolutely everything on her (he should have loved it a little more maybe), Episode 1 has certainly much better background composite effects work, plus animations, Sky Captain never breaking the airplane special effects that Pearl Harbor had, EP1 though had an even better story, so that will tell you what kind of audience this End of Summer 2004 Sci-fi was catering for.<br /><br />By all the means, this is a great movie for young kids because there is no elements of strong violence, except for very light comedy violence towards the end and is devoid of bad language meaning anyone can watch it, and so for that reason should be not be trashed for being at least a glamorous looking Saturday Cinema morning candy stall sell-out that is probably actually worth their dollars this time but if you are older then maybe consider watching all the originals that this one tries to pay homage too first (everything from Jurassic Park to The Day the Earth Stood Still). I maybe still get a better kick out of watching black and white Flash Gordon episodes to give this anything more than a solid three stars. Fun if you like Flash though, but I think this one could have been better.</p></body></html>

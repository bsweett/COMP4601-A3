Brazil is wonderful and Twelve Monkeys is the best time traveling movie ever, but this movie does not click. It starts off really slow, I gave up once. The second time I fast-forwarded through sections I saw before and was able to make it all the way through. There are some good moments and it does tie some loose ends together, but it is just too weird. The non-fantasical world is stranger than the enchanted forest. The happy ending works, but it was a very convoluted and nonsensical path to get there. I can't recommend this movie. It is Gilliam's worse movie.</p></body></html>

Winslet and DiCaprio as the warring couple are excellent if a little bit too "pretty" for their roles. All their bickering becomes a little bit repetitive and depressing. But that this film makes you feel uncomfortable is no accident. It's an unusually mature examination of adult relationships.</p></body></html>

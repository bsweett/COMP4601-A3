<meta name="summary" content="To Kill a Mockingbird"></head><body><p>{The only reason I gave it a mere four stars is that the book got five.}<br /><br />My earlier review of the book amounted to little more than "rah rah rah, go read this!" Now let me go into some more detail. The story is excellent on many levels, and it's a bit more complex than a retelling of the plot would indicate. "Black man accused of raping white girl in the Depression era." That's the court case that drives some of Harper Lee's novel. Gregory Peck won a well-deserved Oscar for his portrayal of attorney Atticus Finch, one of literature's most memorable characters. And yet, in the novel, Atticus isn't the main character. This book is about his daughter Scout and his son Jem. Scout is our narrator, and what we see (and don't see) comes from her.<br /><br />So how did this translate to the big screen? Quite well. The child actors, both newcomers, were excellent in their roles. Ditto on the boy who portrayed Dill, whose part was far larger in the novel but which is good in the film as well. The book had a large number of plots and subplots, so the filmmakers had to strip some away to make it work as a movie. They chose well. The results are still as complex and multi-textured as life itself.<br /><br />I watched this maybe a month after reading it, so I remembered 90% of what would happen, along with much of what was deleted. I doubt the movie could have been done much better than it was, and I'll watch it again. I'm aware of all the "deep dark Southern secrets" from the novel, those that were in the film and those that weren't. I got a strong sense that the actors were equally aware, and that's cool. Nobody could fit them all into a film that lasts under 2 hours, so they only chose the most relevant. This is how it should be. I very love this film, as we say in China, and it'll probably be in my DVD collection until I die.<br /><br />Oh, and this is purely coincidental. Later in this newsletter you'll see "The One-Plot Wonder," which I wrote over a year ago but chose to rerun. I made this decision long before watching TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. But this book, and this movie, are a fantastic example of what I'm talking about. It has many plots. It's what we should aspire to every time we write.</p></body></html>

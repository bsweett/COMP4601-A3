<meta name="summary" content="Inbred Hillbillies + "City Folk" = FUN!!!"></head><body><p>Wrong Turn is one of those fun B-movie gems all Horror fans look for, usually in vain. I mean, how could you NOT like a movie about a pack of inbred cannibals menacing a stranded group of city slickers? Chances are, if you're the type of person who goes to see something like this, you're going to be receptive enough to enjoy it. So leave the snobs at home, and let's go down West Virginia way.....<p>  Wrong Turn wastes no time getting out of the gate, as a couple of mountain-climbing doofuses get waylaid by our inbred trio. The title sequence lays out all you need to know (Inbreeding is bad! An unusually high number of disappearances take place in this particular stretch of West Virginia backwoods. Inbred people are scary looking and mean! They have LOTS of sharp knives and stuff!) On his way to a job interview, Chris Finn (Desmond Harrington) takes that titular wrong turn to avoid a traffic jam (ALWAYS STAY ON THE MAIN ROAD, FOLKS!), and literally runs into a group of stranded vacationers (Headed up by the intense Eliza Dushku) wrecking both of their cars. The group sets off on foot to get help, but soon finds out that you probably shouldn't go barging into people's backwood shacks looking for a phone, and DO NOT look in their tupperware! <p>  Movies like this aren't exactly brain surgery, and saavy viewers will know exactly who will wind up on the menu and who will survive to see the final credits roll. The cast is appealing, the make-up effects are well-done (What else would you expect from the legendary Stan Winston?), and even if the movie doesn't offer any surprises, it's all competently done. My only complaint is the murderous trio isn't shown nearly enough; I would have appreciated a few more lingering shots of them so I could really absorb Winston's make-up designs. I guess that'll have to wait for the DVD, though. Wrong Turn is a fun popcorn flick that hammers home a point us city dwellers have known for a LONG time: STAY OUTTA THE WOODS!!!!</p></body></html>

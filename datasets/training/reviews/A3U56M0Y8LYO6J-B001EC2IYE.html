This is a film more concerned with examining the hard choices that life sometimes asks us to make.<br /><br />Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) asks Frankie Dunn (Eastwood) to train her as a boxer.  Frankie refuses because he says she is too old and a girl.  Yet, the defiant Maggie continues to insist and, with the support of Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman), gets Frankie to change his mind.  Soon she is on the fast track to success but a terrifying accident abruptly changes her life and forces Frankie to make a difficult decision.<br /><br />Eastwood never resorts to melodrama or cheap manipulative tricks in "Million Dollar Baby" to examine the value of one's personal dignity.  He instead uses his veteran directing talents to weave together a heartbreaking story that refuses to supply any easy answers.  Maggie's quick professional ascension may stretch credibility a bit but this is a minor quibble.  Anchored by strong performances throughout, especially that of Swank's, "Million Dollar Baby" is a compelling piece of filmmaking that will undoubtedly linger in your mind for quite some time.</p></body></html>

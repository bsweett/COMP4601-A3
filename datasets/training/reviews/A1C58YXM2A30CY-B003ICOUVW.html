<meta name="summary" content="Clap for the Wolfman -- a New Universal Classic!"></head><body><p>The mysterious, Gothic feel of The Wolfman was really well-done.  First of all, it was great of Universal Pictures to release this film on a full moon.  Unfortunately the full moon hit Valentines' weekend.  *shrug* What do you do??<br /><br />Unlike the 1941 Lon Chaney, Jr. version, which took place in the then-contemporary pre-WWII Europe, this picture takes place in 1890s England, apparently right outside of London, in the inevitably named "Blackmoor."  Nice.<br /><br />Benicio del Toro seems a bit miscast at first glance.  But viewers find out early in the film that Sir Talbot married a Latin woman, so Benitio's Latin looks makes sense.  Without the "Why me?" look of Lon Chaney, Jr., Benicio had the fear of God in him instead.<br /><br />This fear seemed real and sincere, as he discovers he is cursed.  Cursed from the bite of a werewolf.  He implores the local gypsies to help him but this version of Maleva is not much help.  Her advice is to put Larry Talbot out of his misery.  Silver bullets no extra charge.<br /><br />Quite a surprise as to who the other werewolf is (no spoilers here).  The duo werewolf smack-down will make any WWE fan proud.<br /><br />Larry getting captured and locked up in a mental asylum was quite intense.  The director's view of psychiatry as a barbaric science with its use of ice-baths to cure delusion and sticking him with some kind of drugs has, unfortunately, not changed that much in 21st century psychiatric practice.  We've graduated to electro-shock treatments from ice-baths.  A true horror story.<br /><br />The transformation of the man to wolf is great.  Memories of The American Werewolf in London will come to you, and naturally so, because Rick Baker had something to do with both films.  But where to the wolfman's clothes go?  Does he pick up after himself after each transformation?  But I digress.<br /><br />As in the first Universal picture, there is a mild love interest.  It's a subdued, subplot however.<br /><br />Anthony Hopkins (chewing up enough scenery to gorge on!) is delightfully demented as Sir Talbot, Sr.  The gothic mansion atop the hill with moon shining down in its full glory is so iconic -- and the fake time-lapse movement of our lunar neighbor as it glows through the dead tree branches and storm clouds brings back more memories of Universal pictures past.<br /><br />Example:  The usual villagers with torches marching through the forest (with the baying dogs and such, reminiscent of Frankenstein).  The deep howl of the wolfman as he bays at the moon, as he gorges on the liver and intestines of his latest victim.  Oh, the hopping from the rooftops, again reminiscent of Henry Hall's wolfman, Werewolf of London (which predates Chaney's version).<br /><br />The music evokes a mood and the plot moves along quite swiftly.  At times, the audience is surprised as if the director says "boo" out of a closet or something.  He does this a bit too often, but it's still fun to do.<br /><br />If you are any kind of a Universal fan and have waited for a more adult treatment of this film, then you really should watch this film.  See how many iconic pictures you can spot as Universal digs deep into its vault of horror.<br /><br />So don't be a cynic -- turn off your brain, don't think, and enjoy this bit of entertainment.<br /><br />Warning: much gore and decapitations ensue!<br /><br />I understand Bride of Frankenstein is coming soon.  Pray it ain't Anne Hathaway!<br /><br />Recommended - 4.5 Stars!<br /><br />Of course, you can always pick up the originals:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0024FADD8">American Werewolf in London Special Edition</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Y0KRDO">The Wolf Man (Special Edition) (Universal Legacy Series)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6302526159">Werewolf of London [VHS</a>]</p></body></html>

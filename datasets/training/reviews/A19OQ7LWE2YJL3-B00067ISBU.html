It was a great movie.  Not as funny as Men In Black, but it's not supposed to be.  I really enjoyed the movie.<br /><br />Hellboy makes the Spawn movie look tragically lame.<br /><br />That minion of Rasputin's gave me the ultimate heebie jeebies.  I'm going to have nightmares about him.<br /><br />The horrible evil unleashed at the end reminded me of Lovecraft's Yog-sothoth!!!<br /><br />Hellboy rocks.<br /><br />The director and screenwriter Del Toro deserves a nod for this.  Art as its creator intended.  Bravo! Can't wait for a sequel.</p></body></html>

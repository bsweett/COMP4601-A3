<meta name="summary" content="Hitch at His Most Enjoyable!"></head><body><p>This is one of those pictures you can watch again and again--totally delightful -- like eating a big dish of ice-cream.  Wonderful photography, Hitchcock's great directing skills and a superb cast.  James Mason is the perfect "nice" villain--just what Hitchcock always said a villain should be.  The picture has many memorable Hitchcock set-pieces that are now movie legend -- the kidnapping of Grant in the Plaza hotel, the assassination in the U.N., the crop-dusting sequence, the chase across the Mount Rushmore monument.  Add to this a good deal of humor and Bernard Hermann's brilliant score.  How can it miss?<br /><br />Sorry to see  so many reviews that complain of defective discs.  It's a dual-layer disc and apparently the place in the picture being described is the layer transition point, where the player must switch from layer one to layer two.  It sounds like a run of defective discs.  I got my disc in 2000 which I believe was the original release and it plays OK.  I plan to buy the Blu-Ray version when the price drops a little.  Incidentally, some Blu-Ray players, when playing standard DVDs, take a little longer to negotiate the layer transition point than many late-model standard DVD players.  My original release by Warner of this MGM classic, which is anamorphic, looks wonderful on a Blu-Ray player and a large screen.  I can just imagine what the Blu-Ray will look like.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Typical Burton"></head><body><p>There's a lot of criticism focusing around Tim Burton at the moment and it's spiked at the release of this film. The major criticisms directed at Burton focus on his lack of any original ideas and the re-casting of the same actors in every film he makes. Johnny Depp is a great actor; I don't think anybody would deny this, but to cast him in almost every movie made by Burton is just insane and has become repetitive to the point it runs the possibility of damaging his career and casting a negative shadow over the serious roles he has played in the past and may play in the future. Anyway, back to the film...<br /><br />19 year old Alice Kingsleigh is a girl in a difficult situation. Haunted by weird dreams and still mourning the loss of her father, Alice is faced with the decision of deciding whether to marry a man she cannot foresee a life with, despite her family's wishes to marry the man in question. Events lead her to find herself falling down a hole, landing her in a place called Underland which is filled with a number of strange people and creatures and turns her perception of her own life upside down. Greeted by Doremouse, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, and the white rabbit, she is told that she is the right Alice and that it is her destiny to fight the Red Queen's Jabberwocky on Frabjous day to restore the White Queen to power.<br /><br />That is the general gist of the movie plot, but naturally, the story includes the legendary Mad Hatter (Depp) and other wondrous creatures which are lead by a truly brilliant cast. The main cast, both voicing and live action consist of Hatter (Depp), Red Queen (Helena Bonham-Carter), Absolem (Alan Rickman), Tweedledum & Dee (Matt Lucas), White Queen (Anne Hathaway), Nivens McTwisp (Michael Sheen) to name but a few. I would say that the cast are the real saviours of this film as without them, this would have been a bland attempt at re-inventing the Alice's Adventures in Wonderland story.<br /><br />I like Burton's work, I really do. Beetlejuice is up there as one of my all time favourites and Edward Scissorhands isn't far behind. But these were new and fresh ideas created solely from the mind of a genius; but his most recent works have simply been gothic reinventions of classic novels or movies we have all heard of at some point. This is where Burton fails in my head as, although I find his style of film making interesting and visually, the films become quite intriguing, it's all the same just with a different plot. It has come to a point where you can safely say to people that when you've seen one Burton movie, you've seen them all. When considering his works over the past decade, that couldn't be more true.<br /><br />That aside, I liked this film. It was a simple and easy way to kill a few hours and I have to admit that it was kind of interesting to see Burton's twist on this classic tale, so it's sort of understandable to see exactly why he still manages to release financially successful movies. I would recommend this if you already have the curiosity to see this, or if you have some time to kill; otherwise, if I were you, I just wouldn't bother.</p></body></html>

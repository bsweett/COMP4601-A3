<meta name="summary" content="Just too much, rude, crude, trying to be over the top but ends up on the bottom."></head><body><p>If you could have told me last year that such an offensive film could get so much critical acclaim and even awards, golden globe best actor and an oscar for best screenplay, I would have committed to a psych hospital.  Well this one did, and now I am probably the crazy one for not likeing it.  It hard to predict which movies will spark controversy in the media, thing that attack religion such as passion of the christ, or movies such as brokeback mountain.  Now, this movie that clearly is a huge stereotype of Kazakhstanians and the way it beats on the jewish population, I don't remember nearly the press on this movie.  And men wrestling naked...please, warn people. I just don't care for this movie, it was offensive and rude.  And for those that think I "don't get it", no I get it, its suppose to be so over the top its funny, but some things just aren't, and this is one of them.  Luckily it's just a movie. The character of borat is shallow and sterotypical for theatric reasons.  Besides, wasn't this guy done by Andy Kaufmann back on the show Taxi?  Not original, just offensive in my book.  Again, another marker that the acadamy awards are off the base of the standard american public, either that or I missed the sinking ship that american public has taken to make this movie a semi-sucess.</p></body></html>

The picture quality is consistenly completely smooth with a wonderful sense of depth that really shines through.  The audio, meanwhile, is subdued but wonderfully so.  The uncompressed surround is terrific.  Now that the tech specs are out of the way, onto the bulk:<br /><br />Ever since Christopher Nolan's little seen movie entitled Following, I knew we had a director worth keeping an eye on.  Following that up with Memento was perfection and then there was the oft overlooked Insomnia.  Then, he reinvented the Batman saga.  However, scrunched between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight was this little movie about magic, named The Prestige.  Actually, it wasn't really about magic.  It's about obsession, misdirection and mysterious plot twists...pretty much par for the course.<br /><br />Nolan has crafted a fine story that runs like a trainwreck.  From the first death in the film, you know that things can't end happily.  At every corner, each magician tries to top the other, but neither is strong enough to know when to stop.  And what happens when someone has a trick that is utterly impossible to pull off?  How do you top it?  By doing the unimaginable.<br /><br />And it's the unimaginable that will either make you love or loathe this film.<br /><br />When I saw The Prestige in the theatres back in 2006, I left feeling a little bit cheated.  After a pitch perfect first two acts, in which Jackman's Angier and Bale's Borden continued to try and upstage/get back at each other, Christopher Nolan (and brother Jonathan) threw an utter curveball that seemd to not only stretch my belief in what I was watching but completely seemed out of place.  I thought about the movie for a long time and decided that I ultimately didn't like it.<br /><br />The other day, it was playing on a movie channel and I managed to catch it just as the opening credits were running.  "I'll just watch a little bit of it," I thought and ended up staying for the entire runtime.  I bring this up because what I find so thrilling and interesting about The Nolans is just how well-constructed (to a fault) their movies are.  The continual moving back and forth in time is nothing new to them (Following, Memento), but the way it's constructed, perfectly, as the three acts of a magic trick is pure...well, magic.<br /><br />And watching through it a second time illuminated just how early they set up the events.  The twisting third act no longer seemed utterly incredulous (only just semi-incredulous).  The other not-so-out-there twist seemed incredily "duh!" but what was perfectly appropriate was simply how well a fairly obvious answer is hidden in plain sight and yet, not seen.<br /><br />In the end, the final lines speak volumes:  "Now you're looking for the secret. But you wont find it because of course, you're not really looking. You don't really want to work it out. You want to be...fooled."</p></body></html>

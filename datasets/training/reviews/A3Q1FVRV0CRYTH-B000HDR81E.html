<meta name="summary" content="Not what I expected, and for that I'm thankful!"></head><body><p>To me the breakup falls in line with last years `The Family Stone'.  It's marketed as a comedy, but at times it can become extremely uncomfortable in all its seriousness.  I use the word 'uncomfortable', but what I mean is that, if your walking into this movie wanted to do nothing but laugh, then when you see characters crying and it's no where near funny then you feel awkward, like "what am I supposed to do".  That's not a criticism, not at all.<br /><br />`The Break Up' is not, at least in every sense of the word, a comedy.  It is, however, a very good movie at that.  Upon hearing that Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston have the lead roles in this film one may assume that this is going to be another romantic comedy regardless of that fact that the trailer has a lot of yelling and the title itself references the end of their relationship.  What I was so glad to see was that this film took such a different approach than even I expected.  I can honestly say that this film is not predictable and that in itself should account for something.<br /><br />Gary (Vaughn) and Brooke (Aniston) have been together for quite sometime and they've slowly grown out of love, or at least out of sync with one another.  The beginning of the film definitely paints Gary as the villain, which is not what I expected at all.  I was under the impression that this was going to be a case of equally guilty parties, and even though Brooke did have her faults I was still regretful for choosing his side on the menu screen.  After a hilarious family dinner which included Brooke's crazy singing brother, Richard (John Michael Higgins) and Gary's two brothers Lupus (Cole Hauser) and Dennis (Vincent D'Onofrio), Brooke finally has had enough and calls off their relationship.  It's immediately apparent that Brooke went further than she wanted to, but Gary doesn't see that and soon the war begins, the war for friends, the war for space and most of all the war for the condo that they co-own.<br /><br />Littered with hilarious situations and fantastic dialog, `The Break Up' does serve up the goods, but as I've said, and as so many have pointed out, this film is more of a drama with some funny scenes.  It's a very serious and at times depressing film, but it meshes well and delivers solid entertainment.  Vince and Jennifer have great chemistry together and come off as a very believable couple.  I'm fascinated with everything Vince has touched lately, he's really taken hold of his career and steered it in the right direction, and this film is just another notch on his belt of success.  The supporting cast does a great job as well, Justin Long playing the token gay guy and doing so brilliantly, and Jon Favreau and Joey Lauren Adams playing Johnny O and Addie, best friends to the conflicted.  I have to give my props to `The Break Up' for serving up a slice of unexpected and triumphant pie.</p></body></html>

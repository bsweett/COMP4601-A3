<meta name="summary" content="Better than the book."></head><body><p>I remember when Jurassic Park first came out. It was probably the last true blockbuster of the modern era. Everybody loved the special effects and seeing realistic dinosaurs on the big screen (remember, this was the FIRST time a movie had realistic dinosaurs as opposed to Godzilla-like monsters). But what really made this movie click was the characters. It's a perfect mix of lovable and oddball characters. I love the subtle character development over the course of the movie, particularly with Dr. Grant and John Hammond. You actually do care if they get eaten and you want them to survive.<br /><br />Jurassic Park is also the only time I've ever thought that a movie was better than the book. The book was more like a B-rated horror story with flat characters and more violence. The movie by contrast embraces the wonder of seeing dinosaurs on the big screen and is much more fun to watch. It was already an instant classic when it came out and I predict it'll be so even years from now.</p></body></html>

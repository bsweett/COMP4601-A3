Its bang, however, takes place in the twilight of the American Civil War as the Confederate ironclad, "Texas," escapes an attack.  We blitz forward to modern times and are quickly introduced to Eva Rojas(Penelope Cruz), Dirk Pitt(Matthew McConaughey) and Al Giordino(Steve Zahn), in that order by way of swift-moving events.  The Zahn introduction segues into a slower atmosphere, as we meet William H. Macey, who plays Admiral Sandecker and the geeky Rudi(Rainn Wilson).  We also take a brief gander at the primary baddies and from there, the adventure takes off again.<br /><br />Pitt is in search of the ironclad "Texas," which he, and only he, believes has managed to end up somewhere in Africa.  He coaxes Sandecker into letting him take his private boat to hunt for the ship.  The only catch is that he must bring along Rojas and her companions from W.H.O. looking for a cause and cure for a plague that has stricken Africa.  From this point on, the viewer is fed a steady diet of explosions, old-school cannon fire, gunplay, tricked-out plane wreckage, and African tribesmen.<br /><br />McConaughey has hit a homerun with this flick.  It's the perfect beginning for a new action franchise.  He's almost too clean to play Dirk Pitt, but it's the fact that he IS too clean that makes him perfect for the role.  The character just oozes with the machismo of characters made legendary by the likes of James Cagney.  Even his name, Dirk Pitt, makes one think of a soap opera-like hero who always manages to get away by the skin of his teeth.  Zahn is a complete opposite, making his character the perfect foil to Pitt.  He doesn't look or act like Navy material, but somehow he works perfectly in the role.  His comedic timing throughout the flick is dead on.  Cruz and Macey fill out their respective roles perfectly, with Cruz supplying just enough sexuality and innocence to make Pitt fall for her and Macey sort of bumbling around as the leader of NUMA.  The rest of the cast does a wonderful job, though this is Dirk Pitt's story.<br /><br />As stated before, there are a ton of explosions and plenty of action for any fan of the action genre.  It's pretty much all surface here, but the story is just too fun to turn away.  The comedy relies heavily on the skills of Zahn, but McConaughey doesn't take his character too seriously, reminding us of good ol' Indiana Jones.<br /><br />I'm not familiar with Clive Cussler's work, so I don't know how much this contrasts from the books, but as a stand-alone flick, "Sahara" is a breath of fresh air amid a ton of stereotypical action tales.  I highly recommend it to fans of action and comedy.  It's a definite purchase.</p></body></html>

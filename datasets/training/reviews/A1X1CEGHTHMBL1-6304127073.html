<meta name="summary" content="A high action Sci-Fi movie with Arnold as the leading star!"></head><body><p>Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) lives on earth and is the average construction worker and his wife is the beautiful Lori Quaid (Sharon Stone).  Douglas visits a company named Rekall who can provide false memories that give you a real life experience. (Like a vacation but having never left home) Douglas selects to go to Mars but even before he is put under he begins to act violently and the Rekall staff puts him under and tries to wipe any memory of his visit to the company.  He already believes he has been to Mars. They send him home in cab and when he arrives there is attacked by his wife and realizes that his memories are coming back and she is some kind of undercover agent....<br /><br />This is a good Sci-Fi film made about life in the year 2084.  Arnold has been living a hidden life and when his real memories begin to come back he knows he has to get to Mars and go to the mining colony.  This is a good movie and depicts some prejudice views of humans toward mutants as second class citizens. Quaid has to stop the cover-up and release the alien artifact that can change Mars forever.  Some of the special effects are not outstanding while others are very realistic.  I enjoyed the movie as entertaining, especially if you like Sci-Fi.  Arnold does a good job in his role and the story line and action sequences move quickly.  I recommend this movie to you.</p></body></html>

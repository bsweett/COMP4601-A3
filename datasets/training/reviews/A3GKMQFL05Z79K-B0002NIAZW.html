<meta name="summary" content="The Day After Tomorrow......."></head><body><p>Let me begin this review by saying one thing, The Day After Tomorrow is an excellent movie. I loved it. The special effects were outstanding. It's good fun for a date movie.<br /><br />But,....trying to take this movie seriously is actually hard. The story revolving around global warming and the world being hit hard within a week is a bit too hard to swallow. Too, there's just some things in the movie that I just don't see happening quite the same way if they were to happen in real life. I'm not saying that we shouldn't take the threat of global warming seriously but the way it is presented in this movie is ridiculous. If the writer of the film took more time to research the material on global warming, I think he(and Roland Emmerich) could have made an even better film. As much as I love disaster flicks(having collected the majority of them that has come out in recent memory), I really don't know if I could recommend this one for people to buy.<br /><br />However, if you're hankering for a disaster flick to watch on a Friday night with family and friends eating pizza and popcorn, then- this is a rental that's sure to please.</p></body></html>

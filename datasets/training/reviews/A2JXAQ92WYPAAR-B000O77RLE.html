Gosh, I had heard so much about this movie and had somehow drawn the conclusion that life itself would be enhanced after viewing it. However, the film did little for me at all. I thought it a great bore, highly sentimental, strangely unrealistic, anti-Japanese and anti-American. In the first place, the film emphasizes the Japanese concept of honor but then shows the officers acting with shameless dishonor. The General, who is depicted as a solid guy, can't find anyone willing to obey his orders. The officers are so eager to commit suicide, it is a wonder they waited for the American to attack. Virtually every command made by an officer to an enlisted man is greeted with, "yeah, but..." instead of "yes, sir." It is chaos down in those tunnels. One group is going one way, while another is going another. The General's orders never get delivered, and anyone who wants to fight is killed for disobeying the order to commit suicide. I don't believe anything like this took place. The one American captured is fed and treated with precious medicines, but the one Japanese captured by the Americans is shot on the spot, white flag in hand. The fat, smoking soldier who shoots him point blank can't be bothered to guard him. The Japanese come off as the keystone cops, while the Americans, presumably led by Darth Vader, are well-fed, heartless slobs. More Japanese are killed by each other than by the enemy. When they are not swinging their swords at each other, they are aiming their pistols. There are three guys in particular whose job it is to kill as many of their fellow soldiers as possible, for fear they might say something against the Emperor, or fail to kill themselves at the first sight of the enemy. These loud-mouths are extremely obnoxious. I am not sure what Clint Eastwood wanted to achieve by making this "culturally sensitive" nonsense, but I am now persuaded that his aims have nothing to do with art and everything to do with propaganda. Was this supposed to make me see that the Japanese are human too? "Can't we just get along?" Well, I for one am all in favor of getting along, but it is hard to stand by in silence while watching one country destroy another. I'd advise Mr. Eastwood to read the history of the Japanese in Asia, beginning with Korea.</p></body></html>

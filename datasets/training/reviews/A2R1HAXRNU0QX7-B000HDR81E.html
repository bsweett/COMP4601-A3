<meta name="summary" content="Waste of a good cast!"></head><body><p>I only just saw this film.  After all the mediocre reviews when it came to theatres...I wasn't exactly clamboring to see it.  But yesterday, it presented itself and we had time to kill...  And now I know why it wasn't much of a  hit.<br /><br />The trailers of the film promised a comedy about breaking up...and showed lots of Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughan...two performers who have a lot of goodwill stored up with the public.  YIKES!  They used much of it up on this flick.  Anyway, all the "funny" stuff was in the trailers.  There is very little to laugh at here.<br /><br />That would be okay if this were a serious exploration of the death of a relationship, with some lighthearted modern sensibilities.  Nope, what we get is a shrill and unlikeable couple who never belonged together in the first place yelling at each other!<br /><br />That is the film's biggest (and fatal) flaw.  We see the two meet in the opening scene, in a way that was completely unbelievable.  Cut to opening credits which show a montage of Vaughn, Aniston and various friends and relatives in a series of still photos.  We see that these two became a long-term couple, cuz we see lots of shots of them kissing.  Or looking drunk.<br /><br />Somehow they buy a condo together, and when the relationship implodes, the battle over the condo is almost as important as anything else...particularly to Vaughan.  We simply NEVER see these two together as a happy couple.  The very first scene after the credits shows the relationship teetering.  Then there is a highly uncomfortable "family dinner" scene, in which Aniston's closeted brother (played by the usually wonderful John Michael Higgins) sings an a capella version of "Owner of A Lonely Heart."  Then, the families leave and the two fight, break up, and then they spend the rest of the movie one-upping each other.<br /><br />WAR OF THE ROSES, with Michael Douglass and Kathleen Turner, explored similar ground with bitter, brilliant and painfully funny results.  Their one-upmanship with each other was far more brutal than the silly pranks Aniston and Vaughan pull.  See that movie if you want a true BLACK comedy about breaking up at all costs.<br /><br />BREAKING UP, as I said, has tiny laughs every so often.  But mostly you watch and shake your head and wonder "why were these two ever a couple and why do I hate Vince Vaughan and Jennifer Aniston so much?"  We don't really care what happens to either character.  We only see them at their worst.  Then end of the film looks for a bittersweetness...which it actually achieves a tiny dose of.  But otherwise, the tone of the movie is uneven.  It wants to be a wacky romantic comedy...but it misses the romantic part, the comedy part and mostly the wacky part too.  (Judy Davis and Justin Long are the funniest parts of the movie, as Aniston's boss and co-worker...sadly, their characters really belong in another movie.)  On the other hand, Vincent D'Onofrio is plays Vaughn's inexplicably odd older brother, Jon Favreau plays Vaughn's friend as a complete jerk and Jason Bateman is given nothing to do (and pretty much does that).  And Ann Margret shows up pointlessly in one scene as Aniston's mother.<br /><br />What a waste of talent.  I can't think of a single good reason to see this film.  It only gets manages the second star out of sentimental liking for Vaughn, Aniston, Bateman and Judy Davis.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Perfect Ending to the Best Animated Trilogy Ever!"></head><body><p>After watching this film I have to admit that the Toys are my favorite Disney characters ever! In this one, Andy has grown up and is preparing for college. The toys are worried that they will be thrown away as Andy is no longer interested in them. Only Woody is sure that Andy would never do that. In fact Andy packs Woody to take to college with him and sets the other toys aside to put in the attic.<br /><br />Andy's mother accidentally thinks the toys are meant for the garbage and puts them out. Only some last minute action by Woody and TRex save the toys from being garbage fodder (this is an omen of a larger danger later in the film).<br /><br />Andy's mother than thinks the toys were meant to be donated and she then takes them to a day care center. The toys at first thinks they have arrived in Heaven because they meet a whole bunch of new toys led by a big pink teddy bear who tells them they will be played with all day.<br /><br />Unfortunately, things are not as good as they seem as the daycare starts looking like a prison and dangers abound. There are a lot of touching moments in this film and don't be surprised to shed a tear or two.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film as much as the other two. The authors have made another fun and original story and all the toys still have the same voices, except Slinky Dog whose orignal actor passed away. On the DVD extras, the new voice of slinky dog is the original actor's friend and he tells how he imitated the original actor's voice. Also, on the extras we get to meet the voice of Andy who is the same actor (now in his 20's) who needed to be tracked down and luckily was delighted to do the voice again. Ned Beatty is the pink teddy bear, Michael Keaton plays a "sleazy" Ken doll and Whoopie Goldberg even has a character.</p></body></html>

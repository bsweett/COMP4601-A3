<meta name="summary" content="Not a great piece of filmmaking but good enough for Doom-fans"></head><body><p>I went into watching this film adaptation of Doom with little or no expectations other than to see lots of big guns, kickass Marines to wield them and lots and lots of zombie-demons and mutant demons to shoot at and kill. With that criteria in mind I wasn't disappointed by what I saw. The movie felt just like I thought it would. A close to two hour piece of popcorn fluff based off a video game franchise of the same thing.<br /><br />Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is the headlining star of the film with Karl "Eomer" Urban playing a close second. The charisma of both actors is all this movie needs. Every other character in the movie either serves as demon-fodder or person-in-jeopardy. They help enough in moving the story (as basic a plot as there is) from one scary action sequence to the next. The special effects is mostly done with animatronics by the house that Stan Winston (FX master of such films like Aliens, Terminator, T2, Predator) built and it helped in making the demons and monster look real. For a film based on a video game this one has a minimum amount of CGI-effects outside of the first-person sequence in the closing part of the movie. That sequence straddles the fence between cool and cheesy but never seems to fall on either one. Just when it started to look laughable something cool happens that reminded me of the game.<br /><br />The way the film ended and changes in certain characters happened was a surprise to me. I wasn't expecting the film ending the way it did and I think that helped in making me enjoy it enough. The movie is not for everyone but for fans of the game Doom it's a surprise that it didn't suck and look terrible like most film adaptations of video game properties.</p></body></html>

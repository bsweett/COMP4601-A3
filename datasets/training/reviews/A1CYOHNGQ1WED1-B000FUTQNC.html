<meta name="summary" content="Better than expected"></head><body><p>Harrison Ford plays a man in charge of security for a large bank in Seattle. His family is kidnapped so that he will cooperate and find a way past the security for the thieves to steal $100 million dollars. Ford's character needs to find a way to rescue his family and keep the thieves from getting the money.<br /><br />This movie was better than I expected it to be. There are problems, especially with the underdevelopment of most of the characters in the film, but if you can overlook the obvious flaws, the movie builds some real tension in various scenes. There are no stellar performances here. Ford can sleepwalk through a role like this because he's done it so many times. Paul Bettany is good as the head bad guy. Everyone else is given so little to do they can't give great performances.<br /><br />You have to look past a script that is weak structurally, but if you can do that, Firewall is a decent movie.</p></body></html>

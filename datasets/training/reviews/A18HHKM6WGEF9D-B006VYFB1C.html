<meta name="summary" content="Not Just for Baseball Fans..."></head><body><p>...but it helps. This isn't strictly speaking a baseball movie, since it's focused on the business side of things. But there's still a lot of baseball talk and baseball footage, so being somewhat of a fan certainly helped me appreciate this movie. The main thing however, is that I really enjoyed Brad Pitt in this in a way I haven't in along time. He was perfect for his role as Billy Beane, General Manager for the Oakland A's in 2002 who revolutionized the way players are recruited and even the way the game is played by focusing on complex player statistics, as opposed to 'soft' factors. Pitt played the right combination of cockiness and desperation, and I thought it was one of his better career performances.<br /><br />Jonah Hill was also great as the Yale educated economist/statistician he hires, and the entire supporting cast worked. It's a fascinating story. The only thing that kept it from 5-stars for me is that it did drag a bit at times. I felt it could have been shortened a little in the middle, to keep the momentum going. But other than that this is a great movie for anyone looking for a mature adult drama...and if you like baseball, all the better!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The glorious return of the R-rated comedy (that isn't about teenagers)"></head><body><p>For the few times that Wedding Crashers meanders around, the film does much, much more right; and it's a welcome return of the R-rated comedy.  Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn play a pair of wedding crashers who have been in the game for a while now.  However, while Vaughn continues to have a blast, Wilson is growing tired; all of which comes to a head when they crash the wedding of one of the daughters of a Treasury Secretary (Christopher Walken), where Vaughn gets in over his head with one love crazed daughter (Isla Fisher) and Wilson falls in love with another (Rachel McAdams).  In between all this there's some enjoyable raunchy humor, but it's Wilson and Vaughn who make Wedding Crashers a winner.  Both stars, particularly Vaughn in another scene stealing role, are comedically brilliant and a joy to watch.  Though it does wear thin towards it's predictable denouement, Wedding Crashers is a comedic delight, and for those craving an R-rated comedy that isn't full of predictable gross-out gags, this is for you.</p></body></html>

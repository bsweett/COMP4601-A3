I have shopped online and around at stores, but Amazon has them beat by at least $5.00. This is the best action/adventure series out there that the whole family can watch. I find it hard to believe there is a soul alive that hasn't seen them and loved them. If so here is a short synopsis.<p>1. The first movie starts out with a clever superimposing of the Paramount logo before a mountain in the movie. Indiana has to avoid traps in a South American temple and excape with a golden idol. He then tracks down a old girl friend and her father in Nepal for a relic to lead him to the Ark of the Covenant. He must search a tomb and then fight Nazis in order to try and retrieve it. God has the last word and the Nazis get a lesson in religion they won't forget. My favorite by far since there is so much here to enjoy.<br />2.Indiana goes to India and tries to help some villages recover their children and religious stones. Once again he travels around the world. It comes down to him as good against a evil cult leader that requires Indiana style convincing with some assistance from his small side kick, short round, and his girl friend. Oriented a little more towards kids with his sidekicks age, and lots of creepy bats, bugs, and a roller coaster ride in a mining car.<br />3. Indiana gets together with his dad to track down the Holy Grail. Once again the Nazis get in his way. The search takes us all over with great scenery and interesting story line of medieval and religious history. At first we are not aware of the clever female being involved with both son and father, but when we find out how. Well lets just say a fine sense of humor. Ford and Connery are great together. Indy travels all over to find clues to the grail's whereabouts. Indiana must avoid the traps of the tomb containing the Grail in order to save his fathers life, it is action packed to the last. The special effects in all these movies are great. Order them now!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Decent plot and good picture/sound"></head><body><p>This is not one of my favorite movies, but it is an interesting adaptation of Washington Irving's classic story.  I'm a Depp fan and he doesn't disappoint in this one either with his quirky/creepy demeanor.<br /><br />The picture quality is good and the sound is improved as well.  But in my opinion dark movies like this do not exhibit the breathtaking picture quality of brighter scenes in HD.  The picture is a bit grainy at times (not sure if this was the way it was originally filmed).  This is a movie definitely worth renting, but I'm not so sure about buying.</p></body></html>

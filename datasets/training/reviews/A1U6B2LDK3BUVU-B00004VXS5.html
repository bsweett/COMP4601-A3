<meta name="summary" content="Great score, stylized presentation, overrated"></head><body><p>Fairly interesting script, done too slow.  Parts of the movie drag.  Nothing exceptional about it.  Overrated.  The best thing about the whole movie is the musical score.  By far.  It really underlines the action.  I think when people rate this movie as an all time great, what they are reacting to is the music.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood isn't all that good and Eli Wallach isn't ugly.  The bad guy was awfully bad though, so at least he wasn't misnamed.<br /><br />The movie is about the search for buried treasure.  Eli Wallach finds out what cemetery it is buried in, and Clint Eastwood finds out what grave it is located in.<br /><br />There is an unreal quiet throughout a lot of the movie.  You don't get the feeling that you are on earth.  You are out in some windswept dustbowl or desert.<br /><br />This movie is stylized, and that, plus the excellent musical score, are the reasons that it is vastly overrated.  Actually it's not that easy to sit through the whole film at one time, in excess of two and a half hours.  I couldn't do it.<br /><br />When someone calls this one of the greatest films of all time, he's falling for the stylization.  It's like The Emperor's New Clothes.  There's really not enough excitement here to make a really great action movie.<br /><br />Another thing people may be falling for is just how cool Clint Eastwood is.  Remember, guys, it's in the script.  He's not that great a shot in real life.  It's make believe, kids.  He's the Marlboro Man.  So what.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Classic Film Noir -- With a Reverse Twist"></head><body><p>"Memento" is the ultimate movie lovers flick.  It incorporates the best aspects of classic film noir (circa early 1950s) and turns it on its head with the clever trick of presenting the narrative in reverse.  The movie starts out at the end, with brain damaged Lenny taking revenge by killing the man who raped and killed his wife and who left him brain damaged.  But did he get the right guy?  As the film progresses, it becomes more and more unclear.  When the truth is revealed, the "ending" takes on a whole new meaning.<p>Guy Pearce, the "other" Australian actor in "L.A. Confidential" emerges from Russell Crowe's shadow with an outstanding performance as the tormented Lenny.  Backing him up are fine efforts "Matrix" vets Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Ann Moss, who are Lenny's main antagonists.<p>Well scripted, well acted, and challengely put togather, "Memento" was the best American movie of 2001.</p></body></html>

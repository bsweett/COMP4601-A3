<meta name="summary" content="Creepy!"></head><body><p>I was pleasantly surprised or should I say scared by this incredibly creepy film!  This is one of the best screen adaptations of a King novel to a movie since The Shining.<br /><br />John Cusak is a myth debunker who spends the night at places that are reputedly haunted and then writes books about his non-eventful night.  He is warned not to stay in room 1408 at the New York Dophin.  Of course he then insists on staying there and no amount of persuasion can stop him.  Even documented records of 54 deaths in the room don't phase him.<br /><br />During his time there it is bone-chilling horror that may claim his inner soul.  Along the way he re-examines his relationships with his father and his daughter who are both dead.</p></body></html>

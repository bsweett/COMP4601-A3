Damn impressive cartoon technology, but so what? They're never going to be as convincing as human actors. So what do we do with this technology? Move it to the fringes where acting isn't so important, like talking animals, science fiction, fantasy, superhero stuff. TERMINATOR II was an awesome use of the technology, but what else is it good for? This movie is good if you're too exhausted to do anything constructive, like thinking, but I doubt any adult will sit through it twice.</p></body></html>

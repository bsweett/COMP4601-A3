This is probably the best movie I have seen Tom Cruise do in a long time. The movie is interesting enough to draw you in, and it manages to entertain. In the end though, to me it was just "ok" movie. I thought the taxi cab scenes where over done, by that I mean most of the movie is spent in the cab with Cruise talking to Foxx. To me, this got a little old. **Spoilers warning** I also thought some of the writing was poor in this movie. Starting with the beginning of the movie, You already know the girl his going to play a part in the end of the movie, and within the first 20 minutes of the movie, you will know how everything is going to go down in the final scene. To me it was predictable. Some more poor writing can be seen during the bridge sequence. No one grabs a brief case owned by a guy with a gun and throws it into traffic. You would get shot, besides this, what does Jamie Foxx do after throwing the brief case? Stands there! If you just threw a briefcase over a bridge that you stolen from a man with a gun. You would chuck it and run! Not stand their waiting for him while putting up you hands. Instead of running, he stands their and waits for cruise to catch up and draw his gun on him. I thought that was stupid. One other example of poor writing, that you see in a lot of action movies, is the ending. Here we have a whole movie with Tom Cruise shooting people with DEADLY accuracy.  He can take out select targets in a night club, hitting them sqaure on from a distance in a mob of moving people. However, when it comes to the final scene in the movie, he can't take out 2 people? What happened to Mr. dead shot? Anyway, it was a good / ok movie. It is worth a rental, but I wouldn't own it, or probably watch it again, but it wasn't bad either. I did like Cruise as a bad guy though.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="CLASSIC MOVIE WITH ONE OF THE BEST MAKING-OFs EVER"></head><body><p>Personally I prefer the original version of Riddley Scott's phenomenal movie. Somehow I liked the fact that Dallas (Tom Skerritt) was never heard from again making his destiny feel all the more horrendous (even though it is bad enough when you actually see it).<br />The real reason to double dip and re-purchase this DVD: the incredible, just incredible documentary. Deep, detailed and always interesting, it alone is worth the cost of this DVD, no matter how many times you have purchased this movie in the past (at least 2 in my case). The most interesting part of the documentary for me was the story of the alien's design by HR Geiger, to learn how afraid he was of his own nightmares and even of the rumors that the skeleton in his home is actually that of his suicidal girlfriend.You can't make this stuff up !</p></body></html>

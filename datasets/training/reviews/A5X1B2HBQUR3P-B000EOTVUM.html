A lot of reviewers panned this as being too gory. High profile reviewers saying that it crosses the line. I don't know what all the fuss is about. Its got less than a quarter of the gore of say texas chain saw massacre (new one) or say hostel1&2. I found the movie had more of a pshycological fear infused in it due to the character of the australian boogie man aka crocodile dundee character. The story starts of as 2 girls and a guy leave by car to visit the wolf creek a site in the australian outback where the characters plan to hike around. The find their car break down and then are offered help by a supposedly good samaritan "crocodile dundie" type of guy who seems to be a local and conversant with the area. They take the help to be towed by the dundee's guy's pickup. Only it lands out to be a bad deal for them. They just got towed to their deaths. This apparently happy go lucky naive, bumbling along help-a-friend-in-need cheerful stranger happens to be as cheerful when killing people. It's different from the regular slasher film because I felt the terror of this villain. The way he snickers and speaks. He is a true sadist but it's no where near as gory as hostel. The most gory it got to to which some reviewers expressed dissent as being inappropriate was when the villain guy apparently severes the spinal chord of one of the girls with a dagger. Now this is shown in an abtuse way. We dont really see the actual deed in gory detail. If you consider the circular saws, blow torches and drills used to tear apart the faces in hostel, or the hellish implements used to squash, impale and twist people to ther deaths in say the saw series, this movie is very tame indeed. The movie is based on real life unsolved australian outback murders. The movie has a bit of this "blair witch project" feel to it. Not a lot but a bit. I can't say a great movie but a good movie neverthless.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></body></html>

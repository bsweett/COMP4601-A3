<meta name="summary" content="Never wander with Gypsies in places too dark for comfort."></head><body><p>An obscure attack by some sort of beast leads a long-lost son back to visit his father. Along the way he hears folklore of something other than an animal wandering these parts, and is left confronting something that is both sinister AND closer than he ever wanted to think.<br /><br />When I heard that the Wolfman was coming out, I was happy about the release but I was hesitant about the movie. Typically, werewolf movies have several flaws in them and, more often than not, modern movies do not give the werewolf the things it deserves. This movie does that and more, however, by getting great actors to stand alongside a great place and get special effects - leading the watcher on a journey that is both twisting and terrible in a delightful manner.<br /><br />One could tell from the start that this was going to have a lot of gore in it, but the way the gore was placed in the movie was tactful and was also something that one was left to wonder about. At times it simply appeared and you were left watching and wondering, and other times left you wondering if the wolf would appear of if it would simply disaapoint - which it did not. Combine that with a storyline that threads it s was around our main characters and you have yourself a tragedy that had been accursed for a long time and would have remained that way had it not  been for an act that starts as the movie does.<br /><br />Many other things can be said about this movie but, with a fear for giving something away, I simply have to say that I enjoyed it and that I think other horror fans will as well. If you like your movies with the suspense that is required, the acting that is a must, and the location that always plays a part in making a monster work, then you will love this.<br />I personally found myself wanting a lot and thinking it delivered on all fronts, making this consumer happy. It is rare to find that type of thing in modern horror, and even less in something centering around a foundation-monster like the wolf.<br />Great - approved of on so many fronts.</p></body></html>

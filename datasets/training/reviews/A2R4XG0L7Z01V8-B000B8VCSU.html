But his acting is great and the fact that he wrote most of the soundtrack shows that he's one of a kind. <p>I did enjoy this film; I liked it better on my second watching. Although the insults and rapping was good during the rap battles, you could see the rappers literally spitting the words if the camera went in too close. Also, the handshake between Jimmy Rabbit (Eminem) and his friends gradually got on my nerves. The worst part of the film is when Jimmy gets beaten up, and Lily is screaming in the trailer. I cannot watch that part; it's so horrible. I was constantly turning the sound up and down during this, particularly when Rabbit and his mates are out driving in the car, you can hardly hear their lines as whatever they're playing is far too loud. Also, when they're in the Shelter, and the crowd is so noisy! And then I couldn't hear what Brittany Murphy was saying, so the volume was turned back up, and then I had to quickly turn it down in the next scene!<p>Well known for her roles in Girl Interrupted, Cherry Falls, and Drop Dead Gorgeous, this will be THE film of Brittany Murphy's career. Although she normally always has dark hair, in 8 Mile and Just Married, she attempts going blonde and it really suits her. There's chemistry between Brittany Murphy & Eminem and she definitely acts like she's enjoying herself during their sex scene! Lucky Brittany!<p>Kim Basinger plays Jimmy's mum, downtrodden and without makeup, embarrassing her son with her sex life. <p>Eminem's various and prominent tattoos are notably absent during this film, most importantly during the topless shot - the makeup artists must have had fun trying to cover up those!<p>During 8 Mile you can also see and hear the progress on the song that is the theme to the film - "Lose Yourself", which is perfect for this film. <p>The finale is the highlight of the film, worth watching just for that - and Eminem looking sexy in a vest top!<p>The DVD contains: the making of; exclusive rap battles; the music of;  "Superman" music video; theatrical trailer; production notes; cast & filmmakers; recommendations and DVD-ROM features. Definitely better value than some DVDs you can get these days, which don't have much more than the trailer - if that - on them! The "Exclusive Rap Battles" is narrated by Curtis Hanson (director), and also features Eminem talking about his first time doing a rap battle. The whole sequence wouldn't be what it is without the extras; they are definitely part of it. Curtis Hanson gave four of the extras a once in a lifetime opportunity to battle against Eminem. During this, Eminem was actually losing his voice, so he mimes his words, but some of the winners start really ribbing him during their rapping, so understandably, he raps back, making this the best out of the DVD extras. It's a very brave girl who goes up to battle against Eminem, who totally ribs her during his rapping, but he hugs her afterwards. <p>My other favourite about the DVD extras is the video to "Superman", the song which made me go out and get "The Eminem Show" album. It's one of the best songs that Eminem has done, for me, and seeing the video sheds new light on the song. The only thing I didn't like about the video was the female starring alongside him - when you see close up shots she looks a LOT older than she looks from further away. The lyrics, like most of Eminem's songs, are fantastic, and I'm constantly humming it. All the video is brilliantly shot especially the shots of Eminem with 50+ women in their underwear - you can barely see him most of the time!<p>8 Mile is a must see for all Eminem fans and recommended even for non-Eminem fans. It shows Eminem in a different light, to that of his hard man, woman hating rapper persona. You need to see this.</p></body></html>

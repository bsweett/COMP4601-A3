<meta name="summary" content="Great Thriller"></head><body><p>I'm not a big fan of scary movies, mainly because of all the bad decision making and unreal characters (bad guy gets shot 9 times and is still running around full strength).  However, this movie is very well scripted and carries its suspenseful pace in a manner that is rare amongst it genre.  Being a Hotel Manager myself I really appreciate the "Comment Card" scene at the end with McAdams and the angry Gst.  This movie has great action sequences, has a plausible storyline, and "bad decisions" are kept to a minimum.  I highly recommend this movie.</p></body></html>

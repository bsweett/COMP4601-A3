<meta name="summary" content="Not as good as the original"></head><body><p>My oppinion: This new version of the Wicker man is horribale. they changed alot from the original story. most remaks stay true to the original but change a little but this one changed alot of it.<br /><br />About The Film: The wicker Man(2006) is a remak of The Wicker Man(1975) and the movie is about this california cop who witness a car accident and is on medication to help him, but when he gets a message from his ex-wife about a little girl Who is messing on an island he goes there and trys to help find the girl. can he find her lets hope.<br /><br />My Second Oppinion: This movie is really diffrent from the original. they changed practually the whole story. But cages performance and beging in the movie is the only reason for seeing it and in my personal oppinion buying it. watch the original and you'll understand how much they screwed up the story.<br /><br />If you liked this movie check out The wicker Man(1975) & The wicker Man original motion picture Soundtrack.</p></body></html>

I also remember hearing about the violent murder of its writer/director Adrienne Shelly in her Greenwich Village office shortly before the film was released.  Knowing this, watching this film had a bittersweet sadness about it.  The word "bittersweet" is a good word to describe the film as well.  It's actually tagged a "comedy/drama/romance" and that it is, although the comedy part is not "laugh out loud" but the "chuckle" kind that lifts the drama above the plight which the heroine is experiencing.  This independent film defies categorization and has won quite a few awards.<br /><br />The heroine, Jenna, is played by Keri Russell.  She's a young woman with a gentle disposition who works as in a small town southern diner as waitress and is married to a bully of a husband.  She's unhappy in her marriage and becomes even more unhappy when she becomes pregnant.  Her women friends at the diner sympathize with her and add a little humor to the situation.  Dawn (played by the director/writer herself, Adrienne Shelly), is shy and unattractive until she meets a man who adores her and constantly writes bad poetry to honor her.  Another fellow waitress, Becky, is married to an invalid husband and is driven to an affair with her sour faced boss.  A theme of the film is that Jenna is an expert pie-maker and specializes in mixing unusual ingredients with a delicious result.  This is also the theme of the film. And it works beautifully.<br /><br />When Jenna goes to the doctor regarding her pregnancy, she discovers that her female gynecologist has retired and that a young attractive male doctor has taken her place.  There's immediate chemistry between Jenna and the doctor and soon they are embraced in a hot romance of their own.  He's married too and they are both confused about this but can't seem to stop.  In the meantime Jenna is getting more and more pregnant and her husband comes across as more and more of a brute. The owner of the diner is played by Andy Griffin.  He gives a fine performance as the elderly gentleman who eats breakfast at the diner each morning and gives very demanding orders to the waitresses.  He soon befriends the unhappy Jenna and even finds out about her affair.<br /><br />How this all plays out is a masterpiece of writing.  None of it seems contrived the pacing of the film makes it flow.  There wasn't one moment that I was bored, which is very unusual for me, especially in a "comedy".<br /><br />Needless to say, there is a happy ending and I was smiling at the end of the film.</p></body></html>

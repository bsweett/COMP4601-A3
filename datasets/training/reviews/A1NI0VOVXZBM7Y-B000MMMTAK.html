<meta name="summary" content="Not Politically Correct, But Very funny."></head><body><p>I enjoyed the movie besides the subtle hints hidden in there of perhaps a bias towards the U.S.? or maybe just in general? But the movie, The creator and character I don't think are trying to make a political statement, At least not in my belief. It is very funny and provoking, When He chases Pamela Anderson is a favorite scene, when he goes to a Pentecoastal Church is another(Could be offensive, not to me). When He arrives in the U.S. in the beginning ,in NYC and there is all these rude people, and when He talks to A Feminist group.I laughed out loud so bad. Very Enjoyable.</p></body></html>

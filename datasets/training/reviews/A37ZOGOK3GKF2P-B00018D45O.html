I remember Gus Van Sants lame shot by shot remake of "Psycho," and I was certain this was doomed from the beginning.  Instead I was pleasantly suprised by the pacing, script, and the way the film was shot.  It felt 1970 and looked 1970.  The thrills were aplenty.  The gore was splashy and the whole tone of the film was dark and urgent.  I cared about this young group, and wanted them to survive.  They weren't stupid kids high on drugs looking to get laid.  They seemed genuine and like the kids you see everyday.  These good kids were put through a living hell.  A cast of strange villains and one mean muther with a chainsaw gave me a few goosebumps. This DVD is loaded with extras, but one cool feature is the packaging folds out into a chainsaw.  A good time horror movie that stands out on its own.  Well worth visiting 'Texas' over and over.</p></body></html>

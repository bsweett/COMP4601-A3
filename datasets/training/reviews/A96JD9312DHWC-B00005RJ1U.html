In fact, it does it so well that the good parts of the movie, including a nice room coated in mutilated corpses, seem to drag a bit. As I watched on, all I wanted to know was now long it would take to start the car this time, and when the main characters were going to die. O, how I hoped for their deaths.<br />This brings me to my second problem, the characters. Normally, I enjoy meeting the characters of a movie so I can feel their pain vicariously. Normally, but not this time. Even in movies where I wished for the characters to start dropping like flies, I don't usually think this because of the quality of the actor or because of the predicability of their reactions. To understand them, think "stupider than even a believable horror victim" and you've got yourself a role.<br />Thirdly, the plot was a mind-numbing sleeper that simply didn't cut it. Now, I'm not insulting the flesh-eating "demon" part or some of his handiwork, but the Jeepers Creepers insertions, the "psychic" that warns us of these, or the "it drives a scary truck and has your scent, so you'll never be safe" pinnacle the horror structured around was a bit too much for me.<br />All this said, there were still a few, scantly numbered, memorable parts in the film. The "cat lady's" death, a demon loose in a police station taking out cops, and the ending gave this movie a little breath of life. Still, watch at your own risk.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="George C. Scott as George S. Patton"></head><body><p>I knew that George C. Scott was a good actor, but you will never realize exactly how great he is until you see this film.  After seeing pictures of General Patton, it is hard to image the general without thinking of the actor.<p>There is some German and French in the movie, but there are subtitles or someone translating for you.  There is not enough to detract from the movie, but there is enough to keep the movie authentic.<p>This was not a war movie meant to build up the general as larger than life.  Here, you see not only the fire of Patton, but the pathos of a man trying to succeed in a world that he wasn't born for.  In the movie, they point out that he seemed to be ready for the sixteenth century.  He also mentions that he was at many of the historical battles.  With his extensive reading, I do not doubt it.  Although he tries to play politics, he really isn't ready for it.  His forte is battle and seeing him held from it hurts the viewer as well as Patton.<p>I did like the ending of him walking his dog, but I was expecting the rest of the movie.  I do not know why it was omitted.<p>I would strongly recommend this movie.</p></body></html>

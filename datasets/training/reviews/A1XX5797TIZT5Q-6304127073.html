<meta name="summary" content="One of the all-time great science-fiction films."></head><body><p>Total Recall is not only Arnold Schwarzenegger's best film; it is also one of the most complex cinematic statements ever made about reality, technology and totalitarianism.<p>The script is cracklingly smart, with multiple setups and payoffs that require repeated viewing to fully comprehend.  And the world of Total Recall is filled with little details that are now becoming closer and closer to reality:  The &quot;nature&quot; wallpaper in Doug Quaid (Schwarzenegger)'s apartment; the &quot;instant fingernail polish&quot;; the &quot;virtual space trip&quot; that forms the core of the film's conceit; and the equation of government and corporation.<p>As Doug Quaid, Schwarzenegger brings his trademark humour and one-liners.  They fit the character well, making his quest for identity all that much more entertaining to watch; Sharon Stone has her breakthrough role as his insidious wife Lori; Rachel Ticotin is suitably heroic as sidekick Melina; and Ronny Cox offers up yet another terrific turn as villain Cohaagen, a much more complex and human character than his character in RoboCop, Dick Jones.  Cox has a way of chewing up megalomaniacal lines yet also bringing moments of realness and vulnerability to his character, and as a result the film acquires a much richer psychological layer.<p>All in all, this film's greatest power lies in its sociological concepts.  &quot;Blue sky on Mars&quot;; &quot;more freedom, more air&quot;; &quot;the walls of reality come crashing down&quot;; &quot;your whole life is just a dream&quot;; &quot;if I'm not me, who the hell am I?&quot;  Each little detail is worth days of pondering over if you're the kind of viewer who likes to analyze text, and if you're not, you can always revel in Verhoeven's effortless virtuosic filmmaking, the extremely brisk narrative, and the over-the-top action set pieces, where Verhoeven once again sets new standards for both bloodlust and kinetic energy.</p></body></html>

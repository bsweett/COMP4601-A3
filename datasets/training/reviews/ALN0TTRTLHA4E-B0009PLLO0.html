It is raining there are moneys all over the place and the troops march through jungle. Now in reality the part of India invaded by Alexander was north west India. A rather dry place which is now Pakistan. There were no jungles and monkies would have been confined to cages. Why is it that a film is just so inaccurate?<br /><br />At the battle of Guagamela 47,000 heavily armed Greeks met a large number of lightly armed Persians. The Greeks lost 500 killed. Yet the conclusion of this battle looks more like aftermath of the battle of Borodino in which tens of thousands were killed.<br /><br />However the major irritation is not the historical howlers. At school there are two types of people. Those who are good at sport and those who like reading books. The ones who are good at sport develop a self confidence early on and are free of doubt in themselves and what to do. Those who read books are always full of self doubt and dither when faced by decisions. Alexander was a person who was raised for militiary command since being born and commanded large bodies of men from the age of 17. There is not the slightest suggestion that he ever suffered from self confidence or doubt in himself. His invasion of the Persian Empire was a meticulously thought out operation which involved the neutralisation of the Western part of the empire to destroy Persian sea power and to free the Greek cities in Ionia. Alexander then moved to conquer the centre of the Empire.<br /><br />Stone's portrait of Alexander is one of the sort of kid at school who read books, who was eaten by self doubt and dithered. Not only is Alexander portrayed in that way so are his generals. Prior to the battle of Guagamela which was an easy win the movie portrays Alexander's generals as wanting to retreat or not to engage. The historical accounts suggest that after previous victories including Issus the Greeks knew that they would win and Alexander's generals were more confident than he was.<br /><br />The ancients saw Alexander's life as a tragedy. He started his campaign with Greek virtues but he began to be seduced by barbarian customs. He wanted his soldiers to prostate themselves to him and he wanted to merge the Persian and Greek peoples. Stone has a different approach. He sees Alexander as a wounded soul because of his fathers rejection of him and his mother. The real Alexander was not a 20th century feel good type who suffered from identity issues. He was a person who was raised in what was at the time the most militarily developed part of the world and he set about using his country to conquer the world.<br /><br />Still the costumes are good.</p></body></html>

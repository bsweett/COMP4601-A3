<meta name="summary" content="Great CGI and Robert Downey Jr. has the best superhero personality"></head><body><p>This has to be included with the biggest SuperHero movies now. You would think that these would at least become slightly predictable but no, this movie is a totally original Genre movie. I was amazed to find the opening scenes in the dispelling deserts of Afghanistan! From the get-go Robert draws your attention to his millionair personality, and he gets away with it because he's a quirky kind of guy. I'm glad Roberts Bad days are behind him and that he has his Giant Success now. Best movie of the year, and I'm sure it's one of the best reviewed also. What could they be complaining about? It's a fantastic story, with rich characters and the best CGI this year. I look forward to the sequel slated to come out sometime in. Now that I think about it a little more, why can't we say that for now, this is an Oscar Worthy performance by big-time actor Robert Downey Jr.? I don't want to imagine this movie with anyone else. And STRONG performances by Terrence Howard as Jim Rhodes, Jeff Bridges as the Iron Monger and the beautiful and flirty Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts. The CGI was Fantastic! Jeff Bridges sits inside the menacing Iron Monger as if it were right in front of you. Witty, Funny, Alarmingly FUN! Best SuperHero movie since...Since my personal favorite <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B5XOY8">Batman (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a></p></body></html>

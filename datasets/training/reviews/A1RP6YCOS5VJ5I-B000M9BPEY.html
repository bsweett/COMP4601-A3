<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant Film Set In A Modern Day Fairy Tale"></head><body><p>Big Fish is one of the best movies I have seen recently. This is a great drama/fantasy film that almost had me in tears more than once while I watched it. Ewan McGregor and the others did a fantastic in this film. It was good to see Steve Buscimi in the film as well, since I'm a fan of his.<br /><br />Like always, the scenery and the places that the story took place in looked amazing, almost like a fairy tale world within the mind of Tim Burton. This fit in well for this story since the entire film is like watching a modern day fairy tale come to life. I was very surprised with how good this movie was, this has definitely become one of my favorite movies that I have seen recently.</p></body></html>

One is about a bodyguard who is tasked to protect a little girl (Dakota Fanning) in Mexico City.  The other is a dark take of the kidnapping trade in Mexico City.  This movie was much better in the second half of the film.  Denzel Washington shows he can be an action hero just like Schwarzenegger and Stallone.  I thought Tony Scott's direction was all glitz and glamour.  We didn't see who or what the character was like and why we should care about him.  All we know is what he was capable of.  Overall, it's entertaining enough to recommend.</p></body></html>

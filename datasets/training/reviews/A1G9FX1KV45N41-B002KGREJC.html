<meta name="summary" content="Bravo, Bravo, Bravo"></head><body><p>There are plenty of other movies with a similar theme, but this movie shines because of various differentiations, not least being the special quirkiness in a lovable way of the lead character.<br />Juno Mc Guff (Ellen Page) ,a 16 year girl, cute, quirky and with a quick wit and sarcastic tongue) is a girl who marches to her own beat. Juno hides her own emotions and fears under her wisecracks and perky demeanor.<br /><br />When she finds out she is pregnant  by her  on and off boyfriend, the shy Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera) she decides against aborting the baby (which has astonishingly led to attack on the movie by some radical leftist-feminists for the implicit that might be alternatives to abortion). she finds a yuppie couple Vanessa  and Mark Loring (Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman) but gets more involved with their lives than she hopes to be.<br />Juno's deadpan dad Mac MacGuff (J.K. Simmons) domineering step mother Brenda 'Bren' MacGuff (Allison Janney), and her incorrigible friend friend , Leah (Olivia Thirlby) add colour to the production, it is the dialogue that makes this movie, there is more to it than just the plot and you have to see the well done interplay to see what I mean!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Although unconventional, still a fun ride!!!"></head><body><p>At first I did not care for this, but after watching it again, I have to say I love it, definately a fun summer movie, it is right up there with Indiana Jones as far as thrill rides go, Brendan Fraser's Rick O'Connell could in all reality be a rival to Harrison Ford's Jones, Director Stephen Sommers wanted to out do himself with this sequel, & for the most part he did just that, the film begins with the Scopion King (The Rock) who is out to conquer anyone & everyone, soon he is near death as he makes a last plea to his God for eternity, his wish is soon granted as he becomes immortalized for thousands of years, the film then progresses to 1933, some 8 years after the events of the first film, Rick & Evelyn are now married with an 8 year old son & for the most part living a normal life, they still treasure hunt, but with caution, they soon discover the scorpion King's wrist band that has the power to unleash his wrath upon the world, unknown to them, there are mercenary hunters digging in the City of the Dead, the first film's centerpiece, the tomb of Imetopp is once again brought back to life as he is re-united with his love who has somehow been re-incarnated in the form of another woman who bears a resemblence, when they learn of the Scorpion King's wrist band they go after O'Connell for it, that is when the fun begins, soon O'Connell & Co. are once again on the ride of their lives as 'Connell's son who is wearing the wrist band is kidnapped, Imetopp, determined to acquire the Scorpion King's powers proceeds to follow the path of which the Scorpion King dwells, what follows is one adventure after another, Everyone from the original returns for this one, somthing that is rare in sequels, Arnold Vosloo gives more depth to Imetopp, as does the protector(can't remember his name) Patricia Valesquez is stunning as his re-incarnated lover & Rachel Weisz is equally stunning as Evelyn ... & Brendan Fraser is comical as always as O'Connell, definately a thrill ride if you don't take it so seriously, the locations are stunning to watch, Ancient Egypt is brought to life in a very realistic way, a little contrived, but a winner nonetheless, definately outdoes it's original!!</p></body></html>

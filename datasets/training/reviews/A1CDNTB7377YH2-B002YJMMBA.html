<meta name="summary" content="Too Much Happening Too Fast"></head><body><p>For those who hadn't read the book, this movie would be hard to understand.  In the book a lot is explained and the book flows at a good pace.  The movie crams a lot of information at you and you have Dr. Langdon off chasing clues to kidnapped Cardinals and it is difficult to follow what is going on.  The Da Vinci Code, which was an inferior book, played much better on the big screen.  There the audience was given sufficient explanation for everything and the pace was such the the human brain could easily comprehend what was happening at all times.<br /><br />Tom Hanks if back as Dr. Langdon who is asked to fly from Boston to Rome immediately because the old enemy of the church, the Illuminati has surfaced.  Additionally, the world Cardinals have convened in Rome to elect a new Pope and four of their preferred choices have been kidnapped.  Langdon learns that he has only a matter of hours to save the kidnapped Cardinals and prevent an explosion that will level the Vatican.<br /><br />The book went into fine detail as to the development of anti-matter at the CERN Institute as well as exquisite detail as to how the Vatican works when a Pope dies.  That is all absent here, instead the audience is force fed this info in a couple of minutes.<br /><br />The movie does have a lot of tense moments as Langdon races to save each of the Cardinals before they are killed.  Langdon must solve riddles (a la Da Vinci Code and National Treasure) to find where they are but where that translated well in the other movies it falls flat here.<br /><br />I did give the movie three stars because of the grand scenes we see at the Vatican and inside.  There are some tense moments too and while most of the acting is good, the character of Vittoria is nowhere as good as the female character that assisted Langdon in the prior movie.<br /><br />I recommend reading the book before you see this film so you would have too much shoved down your brain at once.</p></body></html>

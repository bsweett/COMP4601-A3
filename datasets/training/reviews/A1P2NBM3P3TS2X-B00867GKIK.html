<meta name="summary" content="Grab it Up."></head><body><p>I saw this film in its first week of release in the theaters and with a sizable audience.  The laughs were plentiful ("Squirrel!") and the entire experience very enjoyable.<br /><br />Problem is, can that experience be duplicated watching it at home on DVD or Blu-Ray?  Mostly, but not entirely.<br /><br />The laughs are still there but not as hearty as you get in a theater full of people watching it for the first time.<br /><br />Visually, "Up" is stunning - as one expects from Pixar.<br /><br />The 4-disc Blu-Ray combo pack provides so much value-added material that it would be a bargain at twice the price.  Even if you don't have a Blu-Ray player yet, buy the Blu-Ray combo pack version because you get the regular DVD anyway and you will have all that bonus material IN CASE you ever buy a BR player.  Duh.<br /><br />I don't consider this to be Pixar's best movie.  I liked "Wall*E" and "The Incredibles" just a bit more.  But "Up" easily ranks as one of the best movies of 2009 and does the Pixar legacy proud.</p></body></html>

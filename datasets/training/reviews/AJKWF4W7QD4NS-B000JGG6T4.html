<meta name="summary" content="Very stylistic and routine revenge trip"></head><body><p>Denzel Washington is a force to be reckoned with in Man on Fire, featuring some glossy and overly stylistic direction courtesy of director Tony Scott; something which hurts the film as well as propels it.  Washington plays a burned out assassin/secret agent type who takes a job being a bodyguard for the daughter (Dakota Fanning) of a wealthy couple (Radha Mitchell, Marc Anthony) in Mexico.  Soon enough, the two form a predictable bond which leads our hero to go on a bloody, revenge filled rampage when the girl is kidnapped and presumed dead.  Were it not for Washington's magnetic performance and the surprisingly realistic interplay between him and Fanning, Man on Fire would be a derivative mainstream revenge flick, but it works for the most part despite some mis-steps by Scott.  The visual style is different from anything Scott has done with his more recent projects, but the frequent unnecessary subtitles are more of a distraction than anything else.  Not to mention that the story is predictable, but despite this Man on Fire still manages to be satisfying.  Also featuring Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke, Rachel Ticotin, and Hannibal's Giancarlo Giannini; Man on Fire isn't the finest work you'll see from any of the party's involved, but you could do a lot worse.</p></body></html>

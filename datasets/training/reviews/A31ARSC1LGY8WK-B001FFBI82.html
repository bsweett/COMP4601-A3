<meta name="summary" content="The frustration of going to war and never firing a shot"></head><body><p>This war film contains precious little action. It's anti-war in the sense that the main character never gets to fire a shot (as Gulf War I is over so quickly) and so is left frustrated - and the viewer is left with this feeling too. We certainly get to experience the boredom and tension that came with the six months preparation for the war. Well made and well acted but not that entertaining.</p></body></html>

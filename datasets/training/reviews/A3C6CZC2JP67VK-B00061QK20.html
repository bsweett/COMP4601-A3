Nameless weaves his heroic though modest story of how he killed the assassins, but the King remains unconvinced, spinning his own version of how he believed events unfolded. It's reminiscent of Akira Kurosawa's RASHOMON, and is a great way of developing a mystery thriller. Zhang Yimou handles the building of the tale expertly, as one would expect from such a master film maker.<br /><br />The direction and photography is artsy without being pretentious. Every shot is worthy of being a work of art in itself. The language spoken is traditional mandarin, even though I couldn't understand a single word except for the word "Yes" but other then that I went on reading the subtitles. (I don't think Tony's and Maggie's voices were dubbed, but I could be mistaken). The main characters were very well acted out, especially that of the role of the Qin Emperor. Zhang Ziyi's character was largely insignificant though, so I think she's been put in to add some star power to the production.Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung were great in there roles. I feel that they had outclassed everyone in this film. Their scenes are so good it drains any remaining interest out of the main story.<br /><br /> The fighting scenes are unusual by most standards, employing an interesting combination of CGI and real action. Some of the powers that the characters possess appear too amazing to be true, but remember that some of the fights only took place in the fighters' imagination. The music, though quite similar to that in 'Crouching Tiger', is appropriate, and sticks hauntingly to the back of your mind long after the movie is over.<br /><br />`Hero' is undoubtedly a beautiful and awe inspiring film. What it lacks in plot substance, it makes up for with structure and script. It elaborates on the ground work created by 'Crouching Tiger' and is an experience that I would encourage you to seek out, as long as you are willing to submit to the film and let it guide you through its world on its own terms.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Hangover"></head><body><p>`The Hangover' is a goofy comedy about a stag night in Las Vegas that goes horribly wrong when the stags wake up in the morning with a tiger in the bathroom (!), absolutely no recollection of the night before and a missing groom. The film quickly descends into frantic farce as they try to retrace their steps and find the lost groom before it is too late. The actor who plays Andy (Zach Galifianakis) is particularly good and makes this film a whole lot funnier and the other actors manage to keep things speeding along whilst raising laughs at regular intervals. This has a real `old school' vibe about it and reminded me of various comedies from the 80's and if you enjoyed the off-the-wall comedies from that era then this will be right up your street. There are plenty of cliches and obvious jokes but they are delivered so well you can't help but laugh despite yourself. You even get a cameo appearance from Mike Tyson who is pretty funny as well. The various elements the stags have to track down and uncover to find the groom keep the story interesting and make you want to keep watching to find out how various things occurred and how they lead to the groom; like a funny detective story. This is a film that doesn't try to take itself too seriously and sets out to deliver some laughs by the time the film ends and whilst it isn't ground shaking or the best comedy I have ever seen, it does achieve it's goal and had me chuckling at points throughout. Worth a look at some point.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN (BLU-RAY) - Wow, this is clearly depressing"></head><body><p>NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN was quite an experience to watch on my large screen HDTV and BLU-RAY DVD player. The movie itself was great and the video transfer outstanding.  This was clearly a visual film in the Stanley Kubric tradition.  As far as I was concerned the level of screen violence did not set any records, however, due to the way it was presented the effect this film had on me was devastating.<br /><br />"No Country for Old Men" is graphic and implied, both explicit and chillingly indirect. The smaller characters are often murdered on screen, while main characters meet their ends off.  The clear message is that violence is as arbitrary and unpredictable as the toss of a coin and as one writer has already said "things are only going to get worse..."  A coin toss often determined if the killer should or should not end a life.<br /><br />I found very chilling that the victim was made to select "heads or tails" to determine his fate. If you were lucky enough to correctly select the outcome of the coin toss, the killer would just hand you the coin possibly suggesting you save it and leave. I was glad when one of his victims refused him the pleasure of their selecting the coin toss, saying that they knew what they were in for the moment they entered the room. You must see this film to believe it. It is depressing to be sure, but I bet you can't take your eyes off the screen.  Just bring plenty of your favorite antidepressant.</p></body></html>

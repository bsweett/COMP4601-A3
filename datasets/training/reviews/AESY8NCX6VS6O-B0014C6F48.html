<meta name="summary" content="An entertaining, funny flick that oversteps its shortcomings"></head><body><p>I'll be honest. I really don't expect much from 'these kinds' of movies, so occasionally one of them does take me by surprise by being fantastic (i.e. - Freaky Friday last year, which would have made my Top 10 list had I not seen it so late). 13 Going on 30 gets really close to "fantastic" in quite a few moments, but has enough uneven little slips of narrative to put it in "cute" category. But let's get this straight - it's cute as hell, and enjoyable too. I'm not going to sit and rehash the plot because just about everyone knows that it's loosely based on the concept of Big - but the movie takes an added step in a great direction by forming that setup into an often intelligent meditation on those moments in life that everyone wishes to "redo." <p>  Jennifer Garner is cloying in the movie's opening stretch, but then settles perfectly into the role of Jenna, a 13-year-old girl who wishes to be 30 and then magically zooms ahead 17 years. Mark Ruffalo is great as usual in the role of Matt, a former childhood pal who resurfaces after all those years. I want to sit and nitpick on a few moments of the movie that had me rolling the eyes and I want to say that there's better stuff out there right now, so don't waste your time...but 30 really pulls out the stops and makes it totally worth it in the end. You don't have to be a 14 year old teeny-bopper to enjoy this movie either - anyone can identify with that age-old sting of regret. This movie will surprise you with its intelligence, its humor, and its ability to leap over a few flaws that you'll forget by the credits. Of course, guys, you can just stare at Garner's perfect body the whole time if all else fails. Jennifer Garner: A+++; The Movie: B</p></body></html>

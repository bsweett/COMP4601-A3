<meta name="summary" content="The Green Mile"></head><body><p>Stellar performances from all of the cast.  The story is compelling, and you really get to fall in love with Coffey, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, who is accused of a horror of a charge that he did not commit.  This is one of those movies that may test your threshold for crying.  Be sure to have some kleenex handy.  Five stars for this fine title.</p></body></html>

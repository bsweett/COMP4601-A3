<meta name="summary" content="Spidey sense is ringing off the scale"></head><body><p>It's plot meanders and shamelessly riffs off the first movie, slams us with special effects and brazenly ends off arrogantly predicting a sequel.  Yet this could easily be one of the greatest superhero movies ever made.<br /><br />SM2 picks up 2 years after the last movie.  Though the last movie ended with Mary Jane confessing her lover for Peter Parker, the two remain unconnected by the start of the new movie.  Trying to juggle college, a part-time job and saving the city from random acts of mass destruction, Peter Parker's life is a wreck.  Both Harry Osborn and MJ have moved on with their lives (and don't dodge foreclosure like Spidey has to).  After losing his job and MJ, and on the verge of flunking college, Parker begins losing his powers, and is forced to consider hanging up his sticky alter-ego for good.  Meanwhile, Parker's idol, the Brilliant physicist Otto Octavius, is on the verge of cracking the key to safe fusion power, while Harry Osborn holds Spiderman responsible for his father's death, and plots revenge.  Will there be an horrific accident at Dr. Octavius's demonstration?  Uh huh.  Will his mind become twisted as he becomes fused with a quartet of robotic arms?  You betcha.  Will he turn criminal to finance experiments that may blast NYC to kingdom-come?  Hey, is Darkman mean?<br /><br />Though a special effects treat, SM2 flies on the strength of Tobey Maguire's understated performance, it also rides the steam of the other players - Rosemary Harris as a feisty Aunt May, Alfred Molina as a likeable if scary Doc Octopus (even though the script just re-writes the same characters Defoe played in the last movie) and of course JK Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson.  With a script padded with tons of in-jokes yet slick enough for the non-fan who doesn't even know that superhero is one word, SM2 is a rare treat.  Best of all, SM2 stays true to the every joe-a-hero theme of the first movie (a point made during a titanic battle royale between Spidey and Doc Ock on a runaway El train).<br /><br />CAVEAT: The flick is, if anything, scarier than the last - a good example being the scene when the arms of the near-dead Doc-Ock come alive and tear up an OR.  If you've got an 8 year-older who loved the first movie, SM2 might still be too much.<br /><br />Lastly - a flick of this scale just can't be enjoyed in full screen.</p></body></html>

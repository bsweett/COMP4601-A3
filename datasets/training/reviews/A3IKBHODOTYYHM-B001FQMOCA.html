<meta name="summary" content="Commendable job by Witherspoon and Phoenix!"></head><body><p>"Walk the Line" is representative of Johnny Cash's life, depicting the rise to stardom and its consequences, as well as brief points about his childhood and, later on, his drug addiction and martial problems. Joaquin Phoenix takes on a tough role as Cash, and does commendable in creating the rebellious man who has high hopes of making it big despite family tragedy and hardships. While the die-hard Cash fans might not be as accepting to call this movie an instant and solid success, I, a new fan of Cash, found the film remarkable and very deserving of the accolades it received in being nominated last year ( I thought this film was far superior to eventual winner "Crash").<br /><br />The most remarkable and entertaining aspect of this movie was the performance given by Joaquin Phoenix (Johnny Cash) and Reese Witherspoon (June Carter), as one reviewer noted. Joaquin Phoenix's ability to make a role like this work, and sing Cash's songs with some success, is what really gives this role much credibility and dignity. Reese Witherspoon's role as June Carter relies on much of what she has had to do before, which is create comedy and be perky. However, Witherspoon successfully makes this role complex and deep, not just one-dimensional, and her ability to portray some of the difficulties that June Carter had in her own life while becoming acquainted with Cash makes this portrayal a success. Phoenix and Carter work well together, and they do an excellent job singing some of the songs by Cash and Carter, as well as performing duets they did together (one of my favorites was "Jackson").<br /><br />The film also covers briefly some of the aspects of Cash's family life, as well as his interest in music. Although this part of the film is perhaps too short (what can you do in only two hours), we understand the heavy guilt that plays a role in Johnny's life for the loss of his brother during his younger years. We also see the riff between him and his father, with Johnny seemingly feeling like the "other" son much of the time, and being unable to please him. Johnny derives interest in gospel music, but, when he is told that that won't sell, he pulls out a song he when inspiration hit, "Folsom City Blues" (Cash will later play in Folsom County Jail after he gets tons of fan mail after writing that song).<br /><br />If there is one negative, it is that perhaps there is too much time spent on Cash's drug addiction. Maybe more of this could have been spent focusing on some of his younger years or the later years.<br /><br />However, overall, this film is entertaining, vibrant, and worth the two hours spent watching it.</p></body></html>

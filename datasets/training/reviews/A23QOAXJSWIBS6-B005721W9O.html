<meta name="summary" content="Very enjoyable"></head><body><p>This was a very enjoyable &quot;poke&quot; at the whole Trekkie phenomenon.  I wonder how William Shatner would handle himself if he were transported to another galaxy.  Allen is surprisingly good.  Weaver is not only beautiful but hilarious.  The real show stealer, for me, was Alan Rickman.  He is consistently one of the best actors working today.  Enjoy this one.  Try not to be overly critical of the thin spots, because the vehicle works quite well on the whole.  I'm not sure if a sequel is warrented, but I guess they've earned the right to make one.</p></body></html>

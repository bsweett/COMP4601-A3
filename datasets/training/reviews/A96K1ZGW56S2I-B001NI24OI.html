<meta name="summary" content="Very Realistic Football Film"></head><body><p>Based upon the best-selling nonfiction book of the same name, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is the story about Odessa, Texas's high school's bid for a state football championship in the fall of 1988.  The movie follows the lives of key members of the team as they begin their summer training through their season that comes to a dramatic conclusion at the Astrodome.  Odessa is a small town and doesn't offer many future prospects for the students who live there.  Most of them come from troubled backgrounds, for example quarterback Mike Winchell's (Lucas Black) mother is sick and dying and Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund) lives with an emotionally abusive alcoholic father.  Nevertheless, hopes and expectations are high for the Permian "MOJO" Panthers and Coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton).  The town wants perfection, meaning a perfect season with a state title.  Coach Gaines wants perfection, too, but he defines it differently.  For him, perfection means giving it all; it is a way of life.  The Panthers start off the season strong, lead by Winchell and star tailback Boobie Miles (Derek Luke).  But then tragedy strikes, distilling the peace and threatening to destroy even Coach Gaines' definition of perfection.<br /><br />FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is one of the better team football movies that I have seen.  The action on the field is very realistic.  That is in part due to some actual footage of Permian football games that were sliced in with filmed footage from the movie.  However, much of the realism comes from the attitude of the characters.  If you've never been to Texas or Oklahoma and have never played football or personally known someone who has, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is an incredibly depressing movie to watch.  The film has been made that way because FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS isn't really supposed to be about football, but it's supposed to be about the characters in the movie.  FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is really a movie about the friendships between a group of close high school friends.<br /><br />Yet, it is a football movie.  I never played football myself, but I generally like watching football movies.  RUDY and INVICIBLE are great films to watch.  They aren't as uplifting, but I also enjoyed ANY GIVEN SUNDAY, THE PROGRAM, and VARSITY BLUES as well as comical dramas like THE LONGEST YARD.  However, as much as I enjoy watching these films, they are nothing like real football in a small town.  FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is.  It's a very realistic film that illustrates how much the game means to many people and if you are connected to the sport at all, it seems a little insane.  For example, in FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS more money is spent on the football team than the rest of a school district's budget combined, the game is followed as a religion, and the biggest moments expected to happen in a person's life are during the Friday night lights of the football season of their senior year.  I realize for many people all of that sounds incredible, but in many parts of the country those things are a way of life.  Priorities might be out of line, the people might be misguided, and living like that seems incredibly depressing, but it's all very real.<br /><br />In short, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is one of the most realistic football movies ever made.  Highly recommended for football fans, citizens of Texas, anyone who read the book, and people who favor dramas scattered with a little sport action.<br /><br />A couple of trivia pieces:  FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS features country singer Tim McGraw in his motion picture debut.  Also, Connie Britton who plays Coach Gaines' wife, Sharon, is also the same actress who plays Coach Eric Taylor's (Kyle Chandler) wife Tami on the television series FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS.<br /><br />An extra on the DVD is the short documentary "The Story of the 1988 Permian Panthers." This featurette is a look back at the 1988 season with some of the real life players from that 1988 team, including Boobie Miles, Mike Winchell, Brian Chavez and Don Billingsley.  Real footage from some of their games as well as television interviews and news pieces about the team are seen.  I really enjoyed this featurette. It's the best extra on the DVD.<br /><br />Other extras include the usual directors commentary, deleted scenes, a brief conversation with Tim McGraw about acting, a behind the scenes personal video entitled "Player Cam", and a comment from director Peter Berg about the reasoning why he added the scene at the burger joint.</p></body></html>

Hackers are murdered and McClane is asked to bring a hacker named Matt Farrell (Justin Long) into custody. Right away McClane finds himself facing bad guys yet again. But that's not the half of it since they can hack into what ever they want and they use that technology to cause havoc in Washington D.C. They also use it to track McClane and control traffic so he has cars coming at him in all directions on top of bad guys shooting at him. So yet again, John McClane is in for one hell of a day.<br /><br />  Despite the plot being a bit silly the film still manages to work on a lot of levels. The action is fantastic even if it can be overly cartoonish and it helps that the effects are excellent as well. Most of all though it's easy to forget how silly the plot is when Bruce Willis is in top form. It also helps that Timothy Olyphant is in good form as the main villian. He's one of my most favorite under-rated actors and he is good here but still I have to say I liked all the main villians in the other films more. He's a cool actor and he trys hard but I still think Alan Rickam, William Sadler and Jeromy Irons were more menacing in the other films. Olyphant still is a worthy addition to that list even if he does come in last.<br /><br />  Justin Long trys hard too but he's no Samuel L. Jackson or Reginald VelJohnson (Family Matters) even. Still though, I admit he gives his best performance since.....playing a Mac. I think if they make a part 5, I'd like to see Taye Diggs play VelJohnson's son who McClane gets stuck teaming up with. This way we could get a cameo from VelJohnson since I actually think his performance was one of the best things about the original film. It's sad that now most people just know of him as the fat guy who Steve Urcle always pissed off lol. So anway I'd like one more film with appearances by Reginald VelJohnson, Bonnie Bedelia and William Atherton but as a retired newsreporter who's now married to McClane's ex wife Holly lol. Anyway from the first trailer I didn't expect much from this film but it delivers more than a lot of the sequels that were released this summer.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Transcends the genre"></head><body><p>This movie transcends the zombie horror genre in ways that are reminiscent of George Romero.  Zombies are the greatest monsters in "monster movies" because they are your family, your friends.  No one wants to be the one that has to kill their once-loved family member and a great zombie story will work with that in mind.  Zombie movies also work on the fears of the current time period.  For instance, Night of the Living Dead (50s) deals with a downed satellite when space exploration and satellites were new.  In the 60s we had zombies that were formed from nuclear means (the Cold war, nuclear annihilation fears).  Today, with SARS and the threat of biological terrorism around the corner, we have this infection that spreads as fast as one minute, turning normal people into bloodthirsty savages.<br /><br />Danny Boyle (director of Trainspotting) infuses this movie with his dream-like sense of direction.  Portions of the movie are so eerily dream-like (for instance, a car ride that passes a field of roses that look like they were painted there) that it shows a stark dichotomy with scenes of zombies and violence.  It's also brilliantly filmed with a digital camera that makes the film look documentary in places, adding to the fear.<br /><br />Horror movies show the worst in humans.  It is often said that a good horror movie, one that transcends the genre, will have a horrific obstacle or monster but that, by the end of the story, the horrors humanity will eclipse the terror of the monster.  For instance, at the end of the Night of the Living Dead, the lone survivor is killed not by a zombie, but from a bullet.  The character happens to be African American in a time (again, the 50s) where segregation and blatant racism ruled.  His character being killed not by the "monsters" but by a human bullet helps propel that movie past its monster movie mania.  The same can be said of 28 Days Later.  To exactly explain how this happens would spoil an excellent plot twist.  Needless to say, this movie shows the horrors of humanity in a similar way to Night of the Living Dead.<br /><br />Another positive in this movie is the fusion of music with what's happening on screen.  In at least two areas, the music starts quietly, in the background.  But, as the scene progresses toward intensity, the music builds to pounding climaxes that really make you feel edgy.  I've watched this movie countless time, but each time the music builds I can feel a knot in my stomach.  Very effective.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent movie that takes the zombie movie in an awesome direction.  It's intense, scary, and smart.  And, it shows us that sometimes it's not the monsters we should fear, it's each other.</p></body></html>

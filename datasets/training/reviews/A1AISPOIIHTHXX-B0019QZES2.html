<meta name="summary" content="It's not the original but has its moments"></head><body><p>The original was quite simply a very funny and likable movie with polar opposites Robert de Niro and Ben Stiller sparring with Ben trying desperately to please Robert and it certainly was funny. It was of course a hit too so a sequel was in the works but not immediately simply because "we wanna make sure the scripts good". They should've waited about a year.<br /><br />Pam and Greg(real name's Gaylord) are getting married soon and Greg has just barely impressed Pam's parents. But now it's time for everyone to meet Greg's. So off they go in their RV with Pam's newphew Little Jack to Florida. And of course Greg's parents couldn't be anymore different than Pam's. His father is very uninhibited and loves to talk and laugh and joke around while his mother's a sex therapist. They also have a cute little dog named Moses which, as dogs like to do, hump things. Which isn't a good thing for Jack's expertly trained cat.<br /><br />There's a noticeable sameness with the film. It almost feels like things were placed together simply because they knew it would work and don't take chances. We still have the jokes about Greg's last name(Focker) such as his cousins Randy and Orny, since one family has a cat, why not add a dog? There's even a moment where through really no fault of Greg's, he's blamed for a big catastrophe, like the original.<br /><br />The casting however is spot-on. Normally playing a kind of know-it-all, Dustin Hoffman is quite perfect as Greg's eccentric dad. And while I normally can't stand Babs, Barbara Streisand was likable, but she still sucks otherwise, just not here.<br /><br />I find it's best to watch it with people since if they laugh you end up laughing too but watching alone it's almost like jokes flatten.</p></body></html>

Morgan Freeman portrays the wise Sergeant Major Rawlins and Denzel Washington the cynical Private Trip who comes to believe in the Union cause.  Also Andre Braugher is great as Thomas the free well-educated black Bostonian.<br />  Heavy hitting emotional impact as Blacks fight against the Fascist South, but find Union racism rampant.  And the sense of becoming part of history, especially the final battle.  Robert Gould Shaw's ideals for the country were as noble as fellow Bostonian, JFK, and in effect they shared the same fate, the fate that noble ideals often lead to.<br />  Finally the theme music is perfect.</p></body></html>

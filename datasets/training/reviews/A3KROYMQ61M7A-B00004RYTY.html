<meta name="summary" content="[Three stars out of Four] Run to see this movie while it's still available!"></head><body><p>Get your VHS / DVD copies of this Franke<br />Potente thriller while you can. Plot: Her<br />boyfriend Manni has left a big skinhead-<br />looking thug's bag with 100,000 Deutchsmarks<br />on a subway and the bag gets picked by a<br />homeless guy. Manni calls Lola, a raspberry<br />colour haired punk rock chick, with a pet<br />boxes turtle to tell her the bad news; un-<br />lass he finds the money, he's as good as<br />fried. Three different versions in here<br />with three different ending of how peoples<br />lives could be changed by the endings. But<br />the last one things turn out alright - barely!<br />Not quite as good as Der Clown or Straight<br />Shooter, among german import films, but Potente<br />is worth a look despite that dumb tatoo on her<br />belly!</p></body></html>

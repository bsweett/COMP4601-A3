I reluctantly watched Slumdog Millionaire, as my wife insisted due to the overwhelming high praise lavished on this film, and while it isn't the worst movie I've seen, it wasn't really my cup of cocoa.<br /><br />For me it had a few issues, for one thing for a movie about some Islamic characters, it was an ironically, Hindu tale in that it was heavy in Karma, but that may be quibbling. More to the point, it was so depressing and violent. Not action movie violent, but sadistic and disgustingly violent. As a movie about India, it is not much of a tourist invitation.<br /><br />What did work for me was the overall message about why would someone be murderous in the name of religion? That the events of your life for good or ill, make up who you are.<br />That true love should win in the end.<br /><br />As for the rest of it... The metaphors were largely lost on me, and the stupid American bit who buys away all trouble, was a bit ham fisted. The music video during the credits... I guess that's a cultural diversity educational bit.<br /><br />So were there things to admire about the film? Yes.<br />Was it the film of the year? Not for me.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content=""I WAS A PART OF SOMETHING" - THE DEFINITIVE MAFIA FILM"></head><body><p>It's a cinch to see why this classic deserves every bit of its stature; five times and I still don't tire of it. Kudos to Scorsese's visceral cinematic style, for this could quite easily have been your garden-variety gangster tale.<br /><br />The rough and tumble world of mafia can be intoxicating, as we follow our protagonist Henry Hill's rise through the ranks in the underworld (Liotta has yet to equal this incredible early performance). His voiceover permeates the entire film, breathlessly, in awe of the things he gets away with.<br /><br />He slowly ingratiates himself in this hood, first as a gofer and then to become a mid-level "family member." The appeal of the good life is summed up brilliantly in the simplest terms possible, "I was a part of something."<br /><br />It's both shocking and fascinating to watch these guys work. There's even an unexpected tinge of sardonic humor along the way, albeit the gallows kind.<br /><br />But between a constant cavalcade of Italian cheese and wine we soon discover that there's a reverse side to getting the best seats at plush restaurants and walking scotfree because cops are on dough. No one in this crowd seems to have a conscience, and eventually Henry begins to look over his shoulders even with his closest friends.<br /><br />His higher-ups include a hitman who is feared and respected in the organization (Robert DeNiro in an understated by chilling performance), a volatile loose canon who may make you laugh one minute and blow your head off the next (Joe Pesci), and the local kingpin who lets others do his dirty work and to whom respect must always be paid. Danny DeVito rounds out the studded star cast.<br /><br />Goodfellas has attracted flak for taking a sympathetic look at violent criminals, but let's face it, Hollywood is hardly to blame for the allure of the mafia. Plus, if anything, Goodfellas demonstrates better than any other movie on the subject how fleeting that heady charm is.<br /><br />It's the most ruthless depiction of the underworld I've seen apart from Scarface, an absolute catnip for mafia movie aficianados but a pretty good watch for the rest of us too. Get a DVD for your own collections, this'll stand up to repeat viewings.</p></body></html>

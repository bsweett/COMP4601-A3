<meta name="summary" content="A Not-Half-Bad Waste of Several Hours"></head><body><p>While I'm not the biggest fan of Disney flicks, I decided to take advantage of the opportunity to check out an advance copy of Monsters Inc's deluxe 2-DVD set. Aside from the amazing CGI work that has made Pixar a pre-eminent production company in the field, I found M-Eye to be a decent presentation that makes little effort to break the hackneyed Disney character format of the strong-yet-gentle hero, his cynical motormouth of a sidekick who always has plenty of snide remarks to lay out, and the slimy, underhanded villain. Interestingly enough, I found the guys who voiced these roles-- John Goodman, Billy Crystal, and Steve Buscemi, respectively-- to fit their characters perfectly. And the usual silly moments that you'd expect from a Disney toon-film also pop up from time to time. Otherwise, it's a fairly charming and safe movie for the young'uns-- well, except perhaps for the Abominable Snowman's lemon snow cones and the deep belch gag-- and a not-half-bad diversion for the young at heart.<p>The secondary commentary track, covered by four of the picture's producers and/or directors, discusses the talents of the voice actors and some of the original concepts for the film to a small degree. But for the most part their coverage is on the technical aspects of the flick, such as the difficulties of trying to imitate certain surfaces, textures, and shading in CGI (like Sully's "fur", for example). I was especially amused by their discussion of how incredibly cavernous the door-storage facility "set" was, which allegedly could fit the Statue of Liberty on each "floor", were it a real set. The THX-mastered picture and sound were top-notch in the way of sharpness and clarity.<p>Much like its other deluxe 2-Disc Disney cinematic brethren (Snow White, Tron, et. al.), The House of The Mouse and Pixar threw in everything but the kitchen sink onto the second platter. There's an entire behind-the-scenes tour of Pixar Studios that outlines the production of Monsters Inc from the voice acting to storyboarding and many other phases of production. There's also an M-Eye 'blooper reel', company play program, deleted scenes, a couple of bonus Pixar shorts (both with commentary tracks), storyboard & concept art galleries, the Monsters, Inc training guide, games for the kids, and lotsa other tchotchkes that'll likely take many hours for you to go through. If you don't find one part of interest, simply check something else out!<p>Then there's the 'practical' special features. The English subtitles match up very well with the spoken dialogue, and even describe some of the sounds being made in each scene. You can also select between widescreen and standard pan-and-scan presentations! You know, just in case your TV screen isn't big enough for you to fully appreciate the widescreen format, or something of the like...<p>'Late</p></body></html>

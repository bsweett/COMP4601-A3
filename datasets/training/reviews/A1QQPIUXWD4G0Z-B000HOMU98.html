<meta name="summary" content="One of the Best Vietnam Films"></head><body><p>Stanley Kubrick's 1987 film is a two part view of the military as an institution more than about Vietnam specifically.  The film first looks at the institutionalization of soldiers through basic training and, second, how such training develops the characters in actual combat.  The film is more of a system analysis than the symbolic social themes present in 'Platoon' and 'Apocalypse Now.'<br /><br />The film starts in Paris Island where several Marine recruits undergo basic training.  This is definitely the best part of the film with the great performance of Lee Ermey as the zealous drill instructor.  The film follows how the training affects the recruits psychologically and how they work as a group.  Trainees who perform under par (Vincent D'Onofrio) are soon put at the bottom of the pecking order and are subjected to the abuse of their peers as well the drill instructor.  As for the combat part, there are pluses and minuses.  True, the city didn't really look like Hue and, in light of the huge offensive the North Vietnamese launched on the City, there don't seem to be many corpses littering the streets or any soldiers in the City other than a young girl with an AK.  Even accepting Joker's (Matthew Modine) limited combat experience, the other soldiers themselves look too disorganized and confused to be hardened men who've been in-country for a while now.  I did like Kubrick's brilliant camera work in filming the combat scenes; the cameras aren't fixed in one place at any time: they follow the action briskly with the men as they run, seek cover, etc.<br /><br />This is a good film to own and watch especially for the first half of the film.  I rate this film with just as much quality and insight as the other two top Vietnam films of 'Apocalypse Now' and 'Platoon'.</p></body></html>

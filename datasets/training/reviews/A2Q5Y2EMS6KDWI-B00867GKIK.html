"Up" ranks as one of the most original tales the team has come up with, featuring one of the most unlikeliest heroes. Carl Fredericksen (perfectly voiced by Ed Asner) was a young boy who idolized Charles Muntz, a revered explorer whose discovery of a rare South American bird fossil turned out to be faked. Forcing him back to the Amazon, Muntz vanishes for years. Carl unexpectedly finds common ground in his dreams of flight & exploration with a sprightly girl named Ellie. In one of the most touching episodic montages I've ever seen, Carl & Ellie live out their lives together: From marriage to daydreaming on a grassy hill to the "Paradise Falls Fund Jar" (which keeps getting raided when emergencies arise) to Ellie's illness & subsequent death. Now alone, old and beside himself, Carl is facing the mothballing of his remaining days in a retirement home. What to do? Simple: The retired balloon salesman attaches thousands of colorful balloons to his quaint little home & sails off to Paradise Falls, the place him & Ellie had long ago dreamed of going to. Unfortunately, Carl has picked up a passenger cowering on his porch: Russell, a pudgy Wilderness Scout who's trying to earn a merit's badge for helping the elderly. Russell is soon driving the old curmudgeon crazy.<br />Upon arrival, Carl soon learns that this expedition is more than he bargained for as Dug--a cute dog fitted with a human-voiced collar--and "Kevin", the rare bird of Muntz's obsession--are along for the ride. Sure enough, Carl encounters the elderly Muntz, whose hero worship of him soon turns deadly once the half-crazed Muntz discovers Carl is harboring Kevin. And so, the movie's tempo shifts from a reflective, whimsical tale into an action-packed adventure full of offbeat twists & turns.<br />In the "adventure book" that Ellie leaves behind, she writes to Carl: "Thanks for the adventure. Now go have a new one!" And that alone sums up what the film is saying: Never stop living, and be there for the younger generation.<br />DVD extras include the charming & amusing original short "Partly Cloudy", and the new short "Dug's Special Mission", an extension of the movie's plot.<br />An animated film that will always remain one of Disney-Pixar's most special efforts!</p></body></html>

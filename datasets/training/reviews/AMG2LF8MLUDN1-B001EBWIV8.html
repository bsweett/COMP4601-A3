<meta name="summary" content="And so the Action Continues!"></head><body><p>As with the first movie, when I first saw this movie, I was unimpressed.  After watching it again, just like the first movie, I became a diehard Matrix fan.  Same great action and special effects.<br /><br />(Spoilers Ahead)<br /><br />I have one gripe.  The love scene between Neo and Trinity and the scene in the temple with everyone dancing around half naked were a disappointment.  Both those scenes were totally unnecessary and uncalled for.  We know Neo loves Trinity and we know Trinity loves Neo.  We din't need to see them make love.  That was a cheap thrill and I don't understand why the directors went there.  They certainly couldn't have been worried about getting an audience.  That having been said, The Matrix Reloaded is still a great ride.  Some say that this film is the worst of the set but I disagree.<br /><br />Many of these scenes have never been seen or even thought of before. There are so many new things to see here. My review would go on for days if I tried to explain them here. Don't feel left out while others discuss the theologies and philosophies of The Matrix. Instead, watch it for what you can get out of it. You may note something that everyone else missed. There are many levels and we don't get all of them at the same time.<br /><br />While many find flaws and faults with all of The Matrix films (what movie isn't flawed?) still others will walk away unimpressed as I did. Mind you I haven't seen any of the Matrix films in the theater. I do urge you to see them more than once. Once the inital shock is over, the many levels contained therein will start to seep into your brain. Pretty soon instead of saying Huh? what? you say Ahah!! I get it. So that's what that means.<br /><br />The Matrix Trilogy has ushered in a new era of sci-fi just as Star Wars did back in the day. It seems like a million years ago. We will never be the same!! We may never be satisfied with the same old thing again. The sci-fi world is forever changed now.<br /><br />I must add my kudos to the main cast. They all did some amazing stunt work and really pushed themselves physically and mentally to learn all of the martial arts moves and other dazzling feats. You can see how hard they trained when you watch the special features on each dvd. Yes there are a lot of CGI scenes but the actors are underneath most of it providing the movement for the camera to capture. Great wire and stunt work.  The sets are fantastic.<br /><br />Parental advisory: There is violence in this movie. There is no nudity or sex but there is foul language and unfortunately the Lord's name is taken in vain. I would advise a viewing age of at least 16 because the plots are so demanding that a younger mind may not grasp the details.<br /><br />THIS TRILOGY ROCKS!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Star Power of the Leads and Zooey Deschanel Saves This Romantic Comedy from Complete Failure"></head><body><p>I am not sure to what part of this terrible script of "Failure to Launch" Matthew McConaughey was attracted, but it is certain that he has a star power. However, that is exactly the problem of this romantic comedy, of which premise depends on the lifestyle of one thirty-something guy named Tripp, who still lives with his parents. His girlfriends, it is shown early in the film, would not like it, even shocked to know that, and leaves him eventually.<br /><br />Now I don't know you, but if you fall for a guy like Tripp, as handsome as Matthew McConaughey, who has a good job (it seems) and owns a Porsche, will you dump him simply because he lives with parents? Yes, his mother (underused Kathy Bates) cooks for him and does his laundry, but it is still sexy McConaughey. In fact, another girl Paula shows up before him, played by delectable Sarah Jessica Parker, and falls in love with him. Apparently.<br /><br />As you see, Paula is actually hired by Tripp's parents, unbeknown to Tripp himself, in order to encourage their son to leave home. However, as I said, Paula really falls in love despite the fact he still lives with his parents because after all Tripp is so nice and charming. As the film's implausible story goes on, it gradually digresses from the initial premise about Tripp's `failure to launch' and begins to rely on romantic comedy clich&eacute; and silly and unfunny gags about animals biting poor characters, Terry Bradshaw's daddy posing naked (no, not frontal) or reviving the half-dead mockingbird shot by a BB gun. It is wonderful, even miraculous, to see actors shine in this messy script. Besides Matthew McConaughey and Sarah Jessica Parker, Zooey Deschanel is wonderful as Kit, Paula's sulky roommate with oddball personality, whose way of delivering lines is ten times funnier than the rest of the film.<br /><br />The film's tagline goes "To leave the nest, some men just need a little push." I don't know whether or not every man and woman should leave his `nest.' Or even so, I am not really sure parents need a woman's love to lure their son to be independent. Though the star power barely makes us forget the film's implausible story and its inept concept, the film still looks like a collection of concocted ideas from the notes jotted down on writer's memo, which probably it is.</p></body></html>

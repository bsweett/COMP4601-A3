<meta name="summary" content="Fog-get About It!"></head><body><p>Made for TV caliber stinker remake of a for-its-time decent horror movie. Acting is bad with TV actors. The dialogue is bad to corny at best. The story is completely unbelievable. Continuity was all over the place. This was just one of those plain old bad movies on cable that you somehow find yourself in front of after stumbling in late on a Saturday night.<br /><br />I remember the original as being a bit more entertaining, but that was like 25 years ago (the original The Fog was actually the first movie that I saw on cable TV in like 1980). So if you're in the mood for a Foggy evening, rent the original. There's no way it couldn't be better than this amateurish remake.<br /><br />More than enough said.</p></body></html>

The deaths are way gruesome (some seem to have been edited, so bring on the Unrated DVD), but they aren't as inventive as the ones in the past films. The acting and dialogue isn't the greatest in the world, but for this kind of film, it could be much worse. This is rated R horror movie that delivers the goods!</p></body></html>

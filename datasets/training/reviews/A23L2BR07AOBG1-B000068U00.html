This is also a special commemorative edition because it's a little older and usually they also cost even more, but not this one.  Boy oh boy, this includes both versions of the film, widescreen and PS, in case you loved the theatrical, or caught it later on video.  The extras are all personalized and funny.  Interviews with the cast and director, a review of the year in independant cinema breakthrough, Sundance film festival reviews of the directors and their films.  Critics at the festival who offer their view on the film, scene specific commentary from various people involved in the production, a dedication to various influences on the film by Tarantino, and much, much more.  My favorite thing was to listen to the raw audio tracks of Stephen Wright recording his DJ work with Quentin, hilarious.  The film is now considered a masterpiece of unique proportions and yet it also talks about certain things in it that might have derailed that success if the public hadn't been open to them, such as the violence.  Overall, a great presentation of a very influential and seminal film.  It almost gives you too many special features, which is rarity.  If you love American independant cinema you awe it to yourself to check out this inexpensively priced gem.</p></body></html>

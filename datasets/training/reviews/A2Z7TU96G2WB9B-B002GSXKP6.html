<meta name="summary" content="Well-paced movie"></head><body><p>When watching the many advertisements or interviews talking about the movie, I got the impression that this was George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, and Matt Damon.  Following along behind these guys would be some other stars who did more cameo than anything.<p>Not true.  One thing I liked about the movie is that all the stars got a chance in front of the camera.  Yes, there is more George and Brad, but I never got the feeling that this was their movie alone.  It was odd that Julia did not have a larger role.  Perhaps with her star power, anything more would have eclipsed the other actors.<p>The movie never drags.  The pace is steady without seeming too quick.  There are special effects, but not so elaborate that it detracts from the movie.  It has an exciting, yet comfortable, feel to it.<p>The script is fresh.  Usually, when actors get in a jam, some divine intervention steps in to save the day.  Here, you may follow the plot and see some of the foreshadowing, but parts of the ending will surprise you.<p>I would recommend this movie to anyone.  It is not just a star vehicle produced because Hollywood wants to do.  This is a good film.</p></body></html>

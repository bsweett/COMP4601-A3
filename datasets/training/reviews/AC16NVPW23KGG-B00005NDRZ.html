The use of the steadicam is amazing as  it glides through the magnificent hallways and lounge. Music by Wendy  Carlos is very effective.(I swear that during the maze chase at the end  they used music from 2001!-listen and you will see what I mean).Best scenes  is where Jack is having conversations with the ghostly Lloyd and Grady(who  was the caretaker!).Film is full of those classic trademark Kubrick  elements(steadicam use, slow pullbacks, etc.)This one is a lot better than  that made for tv version which was simply too long.(even though that  version was closer to the book)</p></body></html>

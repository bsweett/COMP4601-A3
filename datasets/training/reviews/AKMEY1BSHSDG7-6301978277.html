Everything about this movie is perfect, the set-up, the characters, the impossible twists... Everything about Some Like It Hot is flawless.<br /><br />Two out-of-work musicians accidently witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, and the mob knows that they know too much. Desperate to escape, they join an all-girl band about to leave town for Florida. Now assuming the identies of Daphne and Josephine, romance, the mob and utter confusion collide to create one of the sweetest comedies of all time.<br /><br />Just the ending is worth the price of the film!</p></body></html>

Any movie headlined by Denzel Washington translates into an instant spellbinder; Washington puts an extra gear into all of his roles.  Yet the gritty, malevolent, gratuitous violence of this film transcends Washington's powerful acting--and it's violence enhanced, yet ultimately punished, by director Tony Scott's eery cinematography.<br /><br />The plot is certainly nothing original:  A man with emotional baggage befriends a youngster (a precocious Dakota Fanning), then embarks on a one-man apocalyptic quest to avenge a kidnapping gone awry.  Yet this is not your grandmother's quest for vengeance; Washington punishes the bad guys until your stomach flip-flops, and his brooding protagonism is amplified by camera shots and angles and blurs and stop-motion and hand-held sequences. . .compelling cinematography so dominant it eventally interferes with the story itself.  And because much of this movie (set in a very urban Mexico City) is in Spanish, director Scott dubiously inserts subtitles--even when the dialogue is in broken English.<br /><br />Scott is also the star of this DVD's extra features; he tells us, gleefully, about shooting the auto smash-ups, dusting off and using an old 1910-ish winding camera--he even recalls a delightful story about his bodyguard getting beaten up by gangbangers during a late-night filmmaking session in the bowels of Mexico City.  This is all good stuff, and only enhances the "ick" factor of this most troubling film.  MAN ON FIRE gets your attention, and keeps it, through all the muck and the gore, even while you're wishing the camera shot would stay still, and come into focus.<br />--D.

It was kind of boring and completely disbelieving. No way in hell would anyone in their right mind do anything that happened in this film. I hate these 'dysfuntional family' type movies which never make sense and again, are not realistic in the least. I am shocked the Academy even nominated this for anything.</p></body></html>

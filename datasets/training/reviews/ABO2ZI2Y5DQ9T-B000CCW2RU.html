<meta name="summary" content="It's a Copy, But Still a Pretty Good and Entertaining One"></head><body><p>Originality is not Michael Bay's strength, but having said that, I find his latest film 'The Island' fairly entertaining Sci-fi action.  You can call it a copycat of another films in the past -- 'Logan's Run''Blade Runner''The Sixth Day' etc. -- the list would be a very long one, but that doesn't mean that this film is not worth watching.  And surely Michale Bay knows how to make good actions.<br /><br />The film can be divided into two parts.  In the first, you see Ewan McGregor as "Lincoln Six-Echo" in tight white costume wake up from a bad dream.  Living in some big institute managed by wards in uniform, everyday Lincoln is medically checked, is told to do certain things like putting colored substances into tubes, and is curiously attracted to "Jordan Two-Delta," a beautiful blonde female played by Scarlett Johansson though it is strictly prohibited by the authority to touch each other.  But why these rules?<br /><br />The secrets are not really secrets to many of you, and you may find the first 30 minutes pretty dull -- I did -- but anyway, the inmates in this building believe that the world outside is 'contaminated,' and only a few selected ones can go to 'The Island' the ultimate paradise left on the earth.<br /><br />Of course, we know better, and Jordan and Lincoln, once outside the sanctuary after seeing the truths behind the place, have to survive the fight against the bounty hunters.  And in Bay's film, the survival means lots of actions -- chases involving cars, bikes, and choppers; shoot-outs, and hanging from the high building.<br /><br />The actors are all good, though typecast.  They include Michael Clarke Duncan (only in a few scenes), Sean Bean (in his typical villain mode), Djimon Hounsou, and Steve Buscemi who gives some good laughs when opening his closet in his home.<br /><br />The film's time is set in near future, about 15 years from now, but the production designs, collecton of pieces from another sfi-fi films, are not convincing enough to convey the touch of the futuristic world.  But you should know that it's a Michael Bay film, and in his films, like in 'Pearl Harbor,' accuracy means nothing.  It's actions that really count, and they are reasonably done.<br /><br />So is it good?  It depends.  'The Island' has good actions, thrills, and a few disturbing moments (thanks to the role of Michael Clarke Duncan), but it does not mean Michael Bay did something new.  But he knows what he is doing, and he did it better than before.</p></body></html>

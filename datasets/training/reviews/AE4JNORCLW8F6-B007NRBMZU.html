Though disturbing in several areas, the film kept my attention and engaged my mind. Ashton Kutcher gave an excellent performance, as did the other actors. The plot was unique, so this wasn't a run-of-the-mill psychological thriller. Character development was superb, making the storyline that much more engaging and important. I'm glad I ignored the bad reviews and checked it out for myself. It was worth the watch.</p></body></html>

Let me say upfront, that I never have, and don't intend to, read the source material, as it looks boring. The script considerably expands on Irving's characters and moody atmosphere. The movie is very well directed by the Master Of Idiosyncrasy, Tim Burton (see "Edward Scissorhands," a bittersweet love story, or<br />"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber Of Fleet Street," a stylish and operatic "Kill Bill" set in Victorian England). The performances in this movie are first-rate, from Johnny Depp & Christina Ricci right down to the child actor who plays Young Masbath. I love the tender moments in the film (when Katrina holds Young Masbath in her arms and when she holds Ichabod in her arms); those are my favourite bits. What else can I say? I'm very sentimental. The suspense is chilling, and the ending will shock you. When you think, you know what will happen next, think again. Very complex and intriguing gem of a film. I won't say more, lest I give away the plot. "Heads Will Roll."<br /><br />The special features are quite interesting, beginning with a Making of featurette, and exclusive cast and crew interviews, which are very thorough. However, I think Christopher Lee and Martin Landau should have also been interviewed, as their roles were very small, but significant to the plot of the movie. Also, I'm somewhat disappointed that some scenes in the trailer (and lines of dialogue heard in the Making of featurette) were not in the movie or included as deleted scenes on the DVD.<br /><br />I highly recommend the film. It's worth repeated viewings to fully understand the complex (but well defined) plot. It deserved the R rating, for graphic horror violence and gore, and a scene of sexuality.</p></body></html>

Never saw the original movie, but I did see the play. This is even better, with a great leading lady in Nikki Blonsky - her first movie role, she just steals every scene she's in. Reminds me of Jennifer Hudson in 'Dreamgirls', but this is an even better movie. Even John Travolta in drag works well.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="decent, but not perfect, homage"></head><body><p>This film  is set between the two world wars, and does a good job of capturing the spirit and feel of the old serials from the 40s, as a mad scientist decides to destroy Earth, only to be dogged by an intrepid pilot and his feisty ex-girlfriend reporter.  The look of the film, which was done entirely against a blue screen, is great, and the acting, with the exception of Gwyneth Paltrow as reporter Polly Perkins, is very good; Paltrow plays the heroine in a much too whiny way, which gets annoying quickly.  Also, Angelina Jolie does not appear until an hour into the film and then is not on the screen enough after that.  The creatures and special effects are awesome, and the plot is good -- true to the movies it's trying to emulate.  I would recommend this film to those who like special effects, sci-fi, Jude Law or old adventure movies.<br /><br />Extras include two commentary tracks, a gag reel, 2 deleted scenes, an original 6-minute short, a 50-minute feature about the effects and a shorter featurette about the style.<br /><br />The film can be heard in English or French, and subtitles are available in English or Spanish.</p></body></html>

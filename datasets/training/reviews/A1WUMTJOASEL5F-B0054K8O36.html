<meta name="summary" content="Arrrrr, the fourth time around fer sure!!"></head><body><p>My favorite POTC flick bar none, because it was goofy fun, and the 3D effects were special, and seamless photography makes you feel you're in every cave, ship,  banquet room, beach, grotto, and lighthouse. The third installment kind of rubbed me the wrong way because of excessive chatter and bargaining.  The script in this fourth one is merely the pause between many action scenes, and a wine cellar keg full of rambling shots involving sword fights, nasty escapes, and tumbling action aboard ships and village streets. The familiar soundtrack is here once again, proving the original filmakers knew what they were doing with the upbeat score.  Great fun if one can just give themselves up to fantasy with pirates ships, lost hearts, and vicious mermaids.  One of the Jack Sparrow best! Er, that's Capt. Jack Sparrow . . .</p></body></html>

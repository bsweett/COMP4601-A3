They encounter many things on their quests, and many humorous things happen.<br /><br /> This movie is hilarious. From beginning to end, it's filled with random, British-style, humor that will make you howl. The killer bunny rabbit, the Black Knight, the Camelot song, and an ending that will make you go, "WTF?!" is the best parts about this hilarious film.<br /><br /> If you want a good laugh, check this out!</p></body></html>

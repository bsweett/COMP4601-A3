<meta name="summary" content="Happily Disconnected unlike the anchored life of Matt Damon's The Informant"></head><body><p>I'd rather have George Clooney's life in this movie (I have no idea what his character's name is - I just think, "George Clooney!") where everything is expense account-ed plus he gets kickbacks in the form of accumulated miles for every dollar he is reimbursed for anyway.  Everything is done for him in terms of meals, washing dishes, laundry, changing the bed linens, washing the bathrooms (one hopes) and in flight coddling and free oreos in the executive class lounge.  Pretty good if you don't have true love and the desire for babies that true love brings.  Plus, George Clooney's job does not involve expertise except reading people's personal files and his ego-nourishing use of his personality to get over on total strangers.  The job itself sucks but how the job is packaged is great for certain personalities.  Not everyone who watches this movie is going to feel better about nesting in Nebraska or Wisconsin.  This is somewhat like Nicolas Cage's Family Man before Don Cheadle appears.  I think the remorse is projected by the audience.  George Clooney never meets his One in this film.  Anna Kendrick as Natalie is great but really undamaged and inexperienced in contrast to Vera Farmiga's character who could only survive encountering and interacting with someone like George Clooney if she didn't have a fallback situation. If I had been Natalie's age, I would have wanted to sign up to be Up in The Air.  I've heard a Dell rep in Hong Kong complain about five star hotels and business class fares but not everyone would have found it to be a hardship especially if they had no human relationships tying them down.  I could have done this job for decades and happily accumulated unspent income AND kickbacks.  It's a very busy ant stockpiling against the coming winter kind of employment - low expenses and creature comfort perks.</p></body></html>

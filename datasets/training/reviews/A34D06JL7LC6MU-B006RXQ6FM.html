<meta name="summary" content="Certainly One of the Best of 2008"></head><body><p>Doubt is written and directed by John Patrick Shanley, who also wrote the Pulitzer Prize-winning play. The film was one of the most acclaimed films of 2008 and scored Oscar nominations for all four main performances...I can honestly say that Doubt is, without a doubt, one of the best films of 2008.<br /><br />Meryl Streep plays Sister Aloysius, the dictator-like principal of Saint Nicholas Church School. Lips eternally pursed, Aloysius inspires fear in the hearts of staff and students alike. Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is the parish priest who is universally loved by all; nuns, students, superiors...Everyone except Aloysius. When Father Flynn takes an interest in a young African-American boy named Donald Miller, Aloysius warns Sister James (Amy Adams), the young and innocent history teacher, to keep her eyes open. One day, Donald Miller is called to the rectory by Father Flynn...When he returns, Sister James notices alcohol on his breath; she reports her findings to Aloysius.<br /><br />Doubt is not a mystery or a "did he or didn't he?" about the priest. If this is all you want from the film, you'll be disappointed. Doubt is about exactly what it title implies.<br /><br />Much has been made about the performances in the film...I'm about to add to this. Hoffman, Streep, and Adams all deliver powerhouse performances, but for completely different reasons. We have three actors here all delivering various degrees of performances. Streep completely disappears into her role, simultaneous getting our fear, hatred, and sympathy. Hoffman plays his role so well and with such nuance, we don't know how to feel about him. He's fascinating. Amy Adams brings such an innocent, endearing quality to her role it becomes apparent why she's one of the most acclaimed actress's of recent years...And than there's Viola Davis, who has less than 20-minutes of screen time and was nominated for an Academy Award.<br /><br />Davis is the most talked about, despite having only two scenes. In the first, she's working with Meryl Streep and actually threatens to upstage the woman. Davis plays Mrs. Miller and brings such a dramatic punch to the film; it's a travesty that an actress who pulled off such a feat did not win the Academy Award. She is the heart-and-soul of this film.<br /><br />Even the child actor's are good and don't have that annoying "clearly acting" quality.<br /><br />Anyone studying terrific acting need look no further than the scene where Father Flynn is confronted by Sister James and Sister Aloysius. I found this scene more thrilling than many action movies and the way the actors play off each other while the tension slowly builds is just wonderful.<br /><br />Movies based on stage plays are usually so rooted in their stage origins, there's little room in a film version for anything besides great acting and a great story. Well, Doubt has both as well as great set direction and great cinematography by the legendary Roger Deakins.<br /><br />Entertaining, timeless, and powerful. Doubt may not look like a very appealing movie to the masses, but it's a wonderful film with some of the best performances of 2008. Not to be missed.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Vaughn is Hilarious."></head><body><p>I almost turned this one off during the first ten minutes but I am now glad that I didn't.  It started out as semi-ridiculous camp and appeared to be a rehash of Zoolander with Stiller playing another outrageous goofball character.  I also could not buy Vince Vaughn as a broken loser.  No matter what he wears or drives, it's hard not to imagine him being a stud. Yet, overall it was pretty funny.<br /><br />Some of the situational and physical humor was hilarious.  The "all male carwash" was a classic and the movie's highlight may have been a 1930s mock documentary, produced for school children, about dodgeball.  When Vince Vaughn tells a girl scout, "you were adopted and your parents don't love you" I fell apart.  Another awesome line is when he confesses that "when you don't have any goals in life you are never disappointed." Other typical one liners are Rip Torn saying "that dyke can play" and Vaughn's "put your mouth where our balls are."  Torn has a ton of excellent lines and it was hard not to laugh out loud at the sight of their team's S&M uniforms.<br /><br />I recommend this one.  It's good, unclean fun and as politically incorrect as it gets.</p></body></html>

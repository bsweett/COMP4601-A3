Bale, Yelchin, and Worthington give excellent performances. The action and special effects are great. The added 3 minutes of footage give some extra cool touches to the film. Many complain that Skynet should have killed Reese immediately, but they forget that it has always been Skynet's goal to kill Connor, not Reese, and it is never stated that Skynet knows that Reese is Connor's father.</p></body></html>

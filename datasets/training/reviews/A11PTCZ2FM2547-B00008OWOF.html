A young con man impersonates an airline co-pilot, a doctor, and a lawyer; in the process, he cashes over four million dollars in bad checks.  When he's finally arrested, convicted, and imprisoned, he is released early to go to work for the FBI.<p>Is this a great country or what?<p>Stephen Spielberg's CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is based on the true story of Frank Abagnale, Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio), who conned his way to outrageous fortune before he was even old enough to buy a beer.  The Abagnale family is on the cusp of implosion, and when his parents finally split, do does Frank, Jr.  As a 16-year-old living on his own, he quickly learns one thing:  as long as you can write a check, you can survive another day.<p>DiCaprio at last sheds his bubblegum "Titanic" image and turns in an impressive performance.  He shows some remarkable range in a role that is fundamentally and inherently complex.  Tom Hanks is solid as FBI Agent Carl Hanratty, who stubbornly and relentlessly pursues Abagnale from one con to the next.  But it is Christopher Walken as Frank, Sr. who steals the show; Walken effectively portrays the senior Abagnale as a shrewd, yet vulnerable businessman overwhelmed with financial troubles--a con man himself who is pleased with his son's daring duplicity.<p>I would have liked for the film to dive deeper into the ingenious machinations of Frank, Jr's check forging ability, and the Sixties Retro opening credits are so annoying I almost walked out then and there.  Yet CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, not even close to Spielberg's best work, is still very entertaining, and well worth a visit to your local cinema.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Bad Film"></head><body><p>I've seen thousands of movies but WLB is seriously very, very bad. I am shocked that Ford/Pfeiffer/Zemeckis actually churned out a film so awful. Considering how many cool movies Zemeckis has created in the past such as the BTTF trilogy, Who Framed Roger Rabbit and Cast Away, plus his involvement with the 'Dark Castle' movies (House on Haunted Hill, Thir13en Ghosts, Ghost Ship-all graphic and way scary) and Tales From The Crypt for WLB to be such a boring affair is bizarre. <p>Thank goodness I bought this DVD cheap, I would have felt so criminally cheated if I had paid full price for it. Never before has 2 hours seemed so unfathomly long. Every tedious minute is dragged out and every second is felt. <p>This wouldn't be so bad if the plot and story were bearable but the whole thing is so full of holes and embarrassing contrivances that it becomes too hard to swallow. For such a long, drawn-out and tedious affair to have a boring, tension-free ending is unreal. Considering the talent behind this film it's strange for it to be so bad. I wouldn't recommend it under any circumstances.<p>The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby/DTS 5.1 sound.</p></body></html>

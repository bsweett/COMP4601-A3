<meta name="summary" content="Pretty Much of a Repetition of Bourne Identity"></head><body><p>In terms of the series of three Bourne, this does move the story forward a bit, but, in essence, it is a repetition of the Bourne Identity: lots of good action scenes, less plot meat than the little in Identity, and an entirely superficial approach to character. Nonetheless, it can be quite entertaining if you do not see it in a double feature with the first (for the repetition of action might well become boring). On the other hand, if you have not yet seen Bourne Identity, then you can expect some exciting urban chase scenes. The acting is highly stereotyped but quite suitable to the demands of the script.. films</p></body></html>

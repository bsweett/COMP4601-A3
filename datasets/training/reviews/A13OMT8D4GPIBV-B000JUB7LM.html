<meta name="summary" content="A Tragic, Beautiful, and Brilliant Masterpiece"></head><body><p>Clint Eastwood has truly grown as a director.  From his early efforts like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005LC4R">Play Misty for Me</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005NTNW">The Outlaw Josey Wales</a> to his middle character pieces <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006RCOA">A Perfect World</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790729369">The Bridges of Madison County</a> to his critically acclaimed works <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006FDCJ">Unforgiven (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P1XITE">Letters from Iwo Jima / Flags of Our Fathers (Five-Disc Commemorative Edition)</a>, Clint Eaastwood has definitely shown a grasp for directing.<br /><br />So this movie did not seem to be too different to expect from Mr. Eastwood.  But it was.  Coming off the success of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001ZX0PG">Mystic River (Three-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>, Clint Eastwood returned with another critically acclaimed masterpiece.  Following two wins in the acting category, Eastwood directed two more performers to Acaemy Awards in this female boxing story that is so layered and magnificient.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood plays a boxing trainer that trains a new up and coming female boxer (Hilary Swank).  Morgan Freeman (who won an Oscar) plays his former bocing trainee and provides the narration.<br /><br />One of the best movies of the decade and possibly the best of 2004.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Creepy, Odd, Unique Western!"></head><body><p>I know all of you have heard the buzz, the praise and the gushing but, believe me, the film lives up to its reputation. This is, quite possibly, one of the best films The Coen Brothers have made and that's a bold statement indeed when you consider these are the guys that made Fargo. No Country for Old Men is a tense, nail-biting thriller that completely knocked the wind out of me on multiple occasions. All Oscar-winning performances aside, the originality of this film alone deserves to be seen.<br /><br />Oscar, Golden Globe & Goya Award winning actor Javier Bardem handed in an incredibly exciting (and terrifying) performance as the calm, collected and deeply disturbed Anton Chigurh and there's no doubt in my mind that we're going to continue seeing big things from him. Obviously Josh Brolin, Tommy Lee Jones and Woody Harrelson all turned in admirable performances as well but this is Bardem & Coen Country all the way.<br /><br />Its electrifying films like this, and creative filmmakers like The Coens, that really drive home the idea that American cinema was, is and always will be some of the greatest cinema out there.<br /><br />Folks, go purchase this; it's absolutely mesmerizing. The performances were stunning, the violence was unflinchingly brutal and the Coen's knack for dusty nu-Western crime is unparalleled. I not only highly recommend you watch this film but I also recommend purchasing it. In my opinion this is a classic.</p></body></html>

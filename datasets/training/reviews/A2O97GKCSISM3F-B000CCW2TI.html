Air Force One was good, but Gary Oldman's charecter repeatedly infuriated me!<br />This film intrigued me because I saw `a Wes Craven film' on the case, so being on sale on my fye, I had to try it.<br />Rachel McAdams-this being my first intro with her, did a very nice job, and Cillian Murphy-who starts out so quiet and nice, does a subtle jekyll and hyde twist in seconds, very frightning, but still convincing.<br />Wes Craven displays almost no bloodshed, but does an excellent job. How it managed to be so short and PG-13, I'm not sure. Only complaint about the DVD is there's no trailer, other than that, it was great! Kudos to Wes Craven for taking on a different genre-for him, and still doing a great job with it! Thank you, Wes!</p></body></html>

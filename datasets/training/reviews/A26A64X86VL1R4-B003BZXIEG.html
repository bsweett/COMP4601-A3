<meta name="summary" content="Script problems--don't blame the actors!"></head><body><p>This latest installment of the X-men saga made me feel like I was getting in after the movie had already started.  A vital ingredient was missing--a central character whose development was key to the plot.  There were a lot of characters but we really didn't spend much time with any one of them.<br /><br />The result was a somewhat flat action film.  Yes, there was a struggle that needed to be resolved but it really was not amplified enough.  The ongoing metaphor of mutants as the marginalized citizens of our society still worked.  The action scenes were fine, we just were not made to care a lot about how things resolved.  Too bad--many talented actors put time into this movie.  With a little script tweaking it could have suceeded!</p></body></html>

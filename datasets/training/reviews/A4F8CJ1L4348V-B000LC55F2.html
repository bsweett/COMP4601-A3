<meta name="summary" content="Very good movie about magicians"></head><body><p>Since this movie was released, I wanted to see it and now I finally did. I am very happy that I was this movie because of the plot and all of the twists. I will say that I do love this era and time period. The competition of the magicians are what really makes this movie and the illusions that are presented. It did take a "dramatic" turn near the end and it is the ending that you do not expect. I am a fan of both Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman. I think that they are both excellent actors and in this one did an excellent job. This is a must see for anyone that likes "movies with twists". I highly recommend it!!!</p></body></html>

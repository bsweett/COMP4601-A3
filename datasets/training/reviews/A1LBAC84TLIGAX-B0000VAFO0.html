<meta name="summary" content="AN ENTHRALLING VAMPIRE EPIC  9 OUT OF 10"></head><body><p>When the people of today rave about cinematic failures like Twilight, you can't help but wonder, "What the hell is wrong with you people?" Why aren't you people watching 'real' vampire films that are actually entertaining, like the Underworld trilogy? You mean to tell me you'd trade awesome characters who are armed to teeth for emo pansies like the Twilight characters? Shame, shame. There were some people (Including moronic critics) who said that the Underworld series is boring, and yet they raved about Twilight. Here's my opinion for why I think the Underworld series is infinitely superior to Twilight in every way.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Centuries ago, a conflict began between aristocratic vampires called Death Dealers and Lycans (Werewolves who can become human again) which still continues into modern societies. We are then introduced to the sexy Death Dealer, Selene who centuries ago was turned into a vampire by the leader of the vampires; Viktor, who raised her like his daughter. And then after an intense gun battle scene, we are introduced to Michael Corvin, who is being hunted by the Lycans over the fact his bloodline goes back to the Corvinus (The father of both vampire and Lycan bloodlines) line, which means he is the only person in existence who can be both a vampire and a Lycan. So when Selene investigates why the Lycans are after Michael, both are pulled into a dangerous adventure full of hidden secrets, forbidden love, and a lot of intense, bloody action scenes. The plot for the most part is good, but it doesn't seem to go as far as it could have.<br />MUSIC: The music in this film is great, and never fails to set the mood and entertain. I have no gripes with this area.<br />ACTION: This film is loaded with many gun and sword fights, which come with many explosions and lots of blood and gore. Any action fan should have no problem enjoying this film because it rocks. You won't find this action in a pansy, emo, sappy, teen drama vampire tale like Twilight! A true splendor of awesome bloody violence.<br />ACTING: Some people said the acting and dialogue in this film is bad. What bad acting and dialogue? These actors are great, unlike the 1-dimensional, cardboard actors of Twilight. Kate Beckinsale is a great actress and pulls of her role as a vampire action heroine very well. I have no gripes with the other actors either, as they perform their roles superbly as well.<br />OVERALL: Forget cinematic monstrosities like Twilight which are an insult to vampire films, and watch Underworld instead! This is an awesome action epic that both girls and guys alike can get into. If you're an action fan or a fan of 'real' vampire films and you're tired of the stupid Twilight craze, pick this one (Along with the other two) up as well.<br />THE GOOD: Lots of bloody mayhem, great acting, great music, and a fairly good plot.<br />THE BAD: Plot doesn't go as far as it could have.</p></body></html>

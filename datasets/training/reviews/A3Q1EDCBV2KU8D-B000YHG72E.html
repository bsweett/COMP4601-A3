<meta name="summary" content="This is Buddy the Elf, what is your favorite color?"></head><body><p>There are great scenes and then there are some rather painful scenes.  Buddy the elf is a human orphan that sneaks into Santa's bag during a stop.  Raised by the elf in the North Pole.  At some point he learns that he is human and about his real Dad.  He goes to live with his real Dad.  Of course he had trouble adjusting to New York city after living most of his life at the happy North Pole.  His Dad has trouble accepting that he has a son, especially one that is so happy all the time.<br /><br />Of course Santa faces trouble with less people believing in him and having trouble making his deliveries.  He crosses paths with Santa again and now helps to save the day.</p></body></html>

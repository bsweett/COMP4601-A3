However, when the author of the original book, Roald Dahl (1916-1990), upon which both films were based saw the 1971 film, he was so disgusted that he forced the film's producers to rename it to "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory".  Though we will never know today how Roald Dahl would have reacted to the Tim Burton's 2005 version, chances are that Roald Dahl would have been far more pleased with the result.<br /><br />Unlike the 1971 version, the 2005 version both parents of the young Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) are still alive.  His mother Mrs. Bucket (Helena Bonham Carter) and his father Mr. Bucket (Noah Taylor) struggle to support their son, as well as each of the aging parents: Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) who had previously worked at Willy Wonka's factory, Grandma Georgina (Liz Smith, who some viewers may recognize as the character Letitia Cropley from the 1994-1996 British sitcom "The Vicar of Dibley"), Grandpa George (David Morris) and Grandma Josephine (Eileen Essell). Unfortunately, things get worse financially for the Buckets when Mr. Bucket is laid off from the toothpaste factory where he had worked; but the announcement of five golden tickets hidden within five Willy Wonka chocolate bars that will grant the winners to a visit to the mysterious chocolate factory sends the world into a frenzy to find them.  The lucky children that do find them are Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz) and his mother Mrs. Gloop (Franziska Troegner); Violet Beauregarde (AnnaSophia Robb) and her mother Mrs. Beauregarde (Missi Pyle); Veruca Salt (Julia Winter) and her wealthy father Mr. Salt (James Fox); Mike Teevee (Jordan Fry) and his father Mr. Teevee (Adam Godley); and finally, Charlie Bucket, who is accompanied by Grandpa Joe.<br /><br />Another interesting aspect that separates this film from the original is the exploration of Willy Wonka's childhood (Little Willy is played by Blair Dunlop). His father, the eminent dentist Dr. Wonka (Christopher Lee), forbids Little Willy from ever eating any candy or chocolate and forces Little Willy into a maniacal headpiece that prevents Little Willy from closing his mouth so that everyone can see the braces on his teeth.  However, Little Willy, after going trick-or-treating, finds a piece of chocolate that his father had not completely destroyed.  Upon eating it, Little Willy is obsessed with candy and chocolate, which eventually leads to Dr. Wonka abandoning Little Willy.  However, Little Willy has big plans and eventually opens his chocolate factory; but when competitors send spies into his factory, he fires all of his workers and eventually replaces them with the oompa-loompas (with the aid of special effects, each oompa-loompa is played by one actor: Deep Roy).<br /><br />With engaging characters, wonderful songs sung by the oompa-loompas, colorful cinematography, great dialog, superb direction and brilliant acting, I rate the 2005 "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" with a resounding 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to everyone.</p></body></html>

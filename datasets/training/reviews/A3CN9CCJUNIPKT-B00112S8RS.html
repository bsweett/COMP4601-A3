<meta name="summary" content="3+1/2 stars  ====  Dark, depressing, ugly story"></head><body><p>This is a very dark, ugly tale about two brothers who plot a crime together that explodes in their face. It wouldn't be accurate to say that the disastrously botched job ruins their lives, though, for as the film unfolds we find that both brothers were already beyond hope or redemption.  The failed heist only brings things to a head... I was engrossed for the first half of this film, repelled for the rest, as layer after layer of tawdry, icky back-story reveals itself.  If you like dark material, boy, is this movie for you... If, on the other hand, you're already overwhelmed by the ugliness in life, well... maybe you should pick another rental.

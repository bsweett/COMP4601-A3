<meta name="summary" content="Revolting &quot;Revolutions&quot;"></head><body><p>The first sci-fi trilogy for teenagers who have a bloated case of attention deficit disorder comes to a close, not without a bang, but a whimper. Basically, any fan who sees Matrix Revolutions will probablly come out of this wondering why he or she cared about any of this mind spam in the first place.<p>  The war between man and machines takes ahead as the Sentinels breach the loading dock to the human city. Neo is stuck between the matrix and the real world. Agent Smith has taken over the matrix by transforming and absorbing everything in his path (even The Oracale can't stop him). Its up to Neo, Trinity, and Morepheus to save the planet from total ruin.<p>  &quot;Matrix Revolutions&quot;, like its predesessors, rips off other films. This time out Aliens, Robocop 2, Thelma &amp; Lousie (the sunrise scene reminded of the end of this film. I laughed so hard when this scene showed up I got a few intense stares from some Matrix fans, a.k.a. losers) and Saving Private Ryan. A waste.</p></body></html>

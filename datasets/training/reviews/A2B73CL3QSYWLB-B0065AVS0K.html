This film delivers on the promise that director Robert Rodriguez suggested in previous endeavors.  Though assisted by Frank Miller and Quentin Tarantino I was trying to spot the efforts from these contributors, particularly Tarantino, but was hard pressed.  If this was a case where the stunning visuals surpassed the story then this film would be easy to dismiss but that's not the case here.  The story here is primary and the three connecting vignettes flow smoothly.  The acting here is also not overwhelmed by the visuals.  Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke both give their best performances in years and Clive Owen's star continues to rise.  The women here  offer strong performances here in particularly Rosario Dawson, Jessica Alba and Carla Gugino.  The real find here is newcomer Devon Aoki as the lethal Meho.  This film may not be to everybody's taste but it cannot be faulted for lack of originality.</p></body></html>

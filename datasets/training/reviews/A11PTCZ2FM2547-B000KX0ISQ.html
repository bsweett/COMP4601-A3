<meta name="summary" content="&quot;Give 'em hell, 54th!&quot;"></head><body><p>That line, uttered by an obscure character, a white Union soldier watching the Massachusetts 54th Infantry prepare to assault a heavily-fortified Confederate fort, signifies the acceptance of the Union Army's first all-black regiment.  GLORY, director Edward Zwick's Civil War masterpiece, shows us the evolution of the 54th, from a ragtag group of former slaves and freemen--a group under supplied, underpaid, and initially used for manual labor and looting--to an efficient fighting machine.<p>Like many other reviewers, I was pleasantly surprised by Matthew Broderick's portrayal as Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, the young, idealistic leader of the 54th.  Broderick gives this character depth, compassion, credibility, and yes, maturity.  And what else can be said about the supporting cast, including Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, and Cary Elwes, other than &quot;exceptional?&quot;<p>GLORY is profound entertainment:  gripping, violent, raw, and emotional as the fragile subject of race--of racism--is brought to the forefront.  It is a story that is as timeless as it is transcendent.</p></body></html>

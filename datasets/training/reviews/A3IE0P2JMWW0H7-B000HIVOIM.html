<meta name="summary" content="Great Sci-fi, Best Movie"></head><body><p>When Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzennegger) an average construction worker takes a virtual vacation, memories of Mars flood back. Forcing him to travel to the Red Planet to discover his past. Quaid has to help the Resistance to free Mars from the oppressive corporation. One of Arnie's BEST movie's, plenty of violence and great FX. Great with Pizza.</p></body></html>

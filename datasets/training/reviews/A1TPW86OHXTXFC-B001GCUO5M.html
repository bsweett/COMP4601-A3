The book was an abrupt turn from the kind of books Lehane had written. The book was a best seller and this film should be right there up with the novel.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio delivers an exquisite performance as the Federal Marshall who comes to Shutter Island to solve the mystery of a lost woman patient. Shutter Island is an Insane Asylum for the Criminally Insane, and quite an island it is. Off the coast of Boston Harbor this island is one of your worst nightmares. Marshall Teddy Daniels and his new partner, played by Mark Ruffalo, team up together to solve the mystery. But, what they find is a series of mysteries upon mysteries, and the more they<br />look, the more bizarre the situation becomes. Bit by bit Teddy becomes more involved and caught up in the nightmare of the treatments that are occurring on this island. The anxiety that becomes Teddy becomes our anxiety and the old Nazi captains and the stories of children drowning become more real. Take a ride with Teddy in this insane, mad world. What you will discover is so antithetical to anything you ever believed possible. This is a glorious tale, told with the majesty of Martin Scorsese. The  soundtrack from Robbie Robertson is ominous and stunning.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.  prisrob 06-15-10<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001N44BVQ">Body of Lies (Widescreen Edition)</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305941122">A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies</a></p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Buy it? Not necessarily.  Watch it? Definitely recommended"></head><body><p>I see another reviewer here at Amazon.com is recommending purchase of this flick (see review titled: Don't Hold Back).  I'm not trying to be contrary, but I'll disagree a bit with that recommendation.  Not because the movie isn't worth it, but more because the Blu-ray disc version is relatively sparce on extras and also because the long-term value for this disc/package doesn't seem high enough to get over the threshold I'd would normally set for recommending purchase versus rental.<br /><br />The film itself is certainly worth viewing, so at least do yourself the favor of renting via Unbox or any other service you prefer.  While the subject matter is sad and somewhat depressing (two victims of cancer or other terminal diseases bond while sharing a hospital room) to begin with, the journey the two individuals make is heartwarming and somewhat uplifting.<br /><br />The movie is fairly short, clocking in at 97 minutes.  The first major portion of the film deals with the main characters finding out about their illnesses and living through (mostly suffering through) treatment for same.  That segment is fairly depressing and not necessarily easy to get through.  It is worth watching just to educate yourself on what life with cancer or a tumor is like, and especially what life while being treated for such things would be like.<br /><br />Once past that part of the film, the story that was promised in trailers and advertisements for the movie comes through, that of a pair of friends that go off to do the things on their 'bucket list' -- a list of things to be done before kicking the bucket.<br /><br />Seeing these two great actors playing these roles and doing a great job in portraying their characters is well worth the price of admission here.  They both are living legends, and both do a great job of playing believable characters.  Additionally, the director for the film is none other than Rob Reiner, himself a legandary director.  A genuine A team of talent.<br /><br />See this movie.  It is most definitely recommended viewing.  Purchase decision really comes down to what you want from a Blu-ray disc or DVD package.  Basic movie? It's here.  A few extras? Yeah, there are a few here, and those that are here aren't bad, but overall the bundle is weak and leaves the feeling that there should have been more.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A unique coming of age story"></head><body><p>Despite not exactly being what a friend of mine and me had hoped on our girl's night out, we still enjoyed this screenplay. It has powerful messages about courage and ethics.<br /><br />Ofelia (Ivana Baquero)'s world is really glum in 1944 Spain. Her pregnant mother is sickly and she doesn't really get along with her new stepfather either. Naturally then, when she discovers an alternate world, she finds solace in escaping to it--despite it also being filled with danger.<br /><br />She retreats even further when this family mocks her for believing in fairy tales. Anybody who's ever lived in a dysfunctional family of any kind can strongly identify with this theme of the film despite the subtitling--being the family outsider (i.e. black sheep) is not a fun position for a person to be in.<br /><br />Ofelia intentionally is supposed to be the character audiences identify with throughout the story, she is an outcast but is constantly on a mission to do the right thing for herself and others.  She attempts to help her mother through a diffcult pregnancy and then rescues her brother.<br /><br />This screenplay is one of the most realistic I have ever seen--not because of the violence (which admittedly there is lots) but because she is a multi-dimensional character.<br /><br />She is young and innocent, but also disobeys both her family and the magical creatures in her alternate universe. She deliberately samples fruit off of a table despite previously having been told not to eat anything and then has the nerve to beg (whine?) that she deserves another chance to receive her gift.<br /><br />People expecting the prototypical happy ending which is usually featured in fare featuring children as a lead need to be advised that like the rest of this screen play, this one is interesting but dark and quirky.</p></body></html>

This is one of the all-time funniest movies ever made (one of many by Mel Brooks that are on that list) and a delight from beginning to end. I loved seeing some of the deleted scenes and the actors chosen for their roles were perfect. Marty Feldman alone accounted for quite a few of the laughs, really making the role of "Eye-Gore" come alive.<br /><br />I'm sitting here smiling just THINKING about this movie again!</p></body></html>

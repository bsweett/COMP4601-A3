<meta name="summary" content="Iron Man-Chapter One"></head><body><p>The big screen was blessed this year with two superlative comic book adaptations, "Iron Man" and "The Dark Knight".  What's not to like about "Iron Man"?  Good acting, characters that are full bodied and make sense, good visual effects and edge-of-your-seat action.  What's my reservation about the flick?  It feels like an incomplete film.  It seems like it's mostly exposition.  By the time the flick really heats up it's over.  It's like the makers of the "Iron Man" were so confident in it's success that they're setting you up for the sequel which, now with the film's success, is inevitable.  I might elevate this film to five stars if the sequel's any good.</p></body></html>

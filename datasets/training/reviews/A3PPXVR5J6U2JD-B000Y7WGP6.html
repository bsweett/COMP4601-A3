<meta name="summary" content="A slow morality tale"></head><body><p>Like The Hurt Locker, The Kingdom is about Americans in a foreign land, this time Saudi Arabia. After an innovative sequence retelling the tale of America's complicated relationship with Saudi Arabia, we witness an escalating series of suicide bomber attacks against an American oil company's housing compound.  The Kingdom never lets us forget that children's lives are at stake here, both American and Saudi, and that war exacts a terrible human cost.<br /><br />Special Agent Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx) leads the charge to track down the terrorists responsible for the bombing.  He brings forensic examiner Janet Mayes (Jennifer Garner), intelligence analyst Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman), and bomb technician Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper) into Saudi Arabia by bending the rules of diplomacy and law.<br /><br />What ensues is a boring investigation in which the American team is delayed at every turn.  There are issues with gender, challenges with the ruling monarchy, and good old government politics. Where The Hurt Locker was a knuckle-biting series of escalating mental and emotional challenges, The Kingdom is a slow drag through a frustrating series of roadblocks that, while they may be realistic, don't make for good storytelling.<br /><br />After the good guys defeat the bad guys with a rote firefight, the American agents are ordered home - too easy, of course.  The real villains ambush our heroes as they depart and, after kidnapping poor Leavitt, helpfully lead the agents back to their lair and the man responsible for the bombing in the first place.<br /><br />The most tender moments, and the best acting, are from the children and their fathers.  Foxx spends most of the movie angry, but he comes to life whenever he interacts with the kids.  Unfortunately, almost all of those interactions are to deliver the news about the death of the kid's father.<br /><br />The Kingdom veers from trying to drive home the cultural differences of Saudi Arabia to a stereotypical terrorist plot complete with an attempted televised beheading.  When the same trope shows up in Syfy Channel's Sand Serpents, you know something's wrong.<br /><br />The real story belongs to Colonel Faris al-Ghazi (Ashraf Barhom), who straddles the fine line between doing his job and loyalty to his country. If The Kingdom gets something right, it's in portraying al-Ghazi as a hero, a soldier, and a father. And that's what The Kingdom is really about - the sins of the fathers visited upon their sons. I just wish it didn't take so long to make its point.</p></body></html>

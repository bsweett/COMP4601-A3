<meta name="summary" content="Nothing Amazing, But Still Great"></head><body><p>Now let me be honest from the start and say that I've only read the first 4 Harry Potter books and have never really been interested in the rest. I must also be honest and say I've only ever really been a casual fan of the films, not getting overly excited about the upcoming release, nor being somewhat ashamed of even saying "oh that looks good." I simply ended up watching Order of the Phoenix on a whim and I must say I found it very enjoyable. The combination of the hidden magic world and believable characters, really allow the film to blend into one hell of a two hour ride.<br /><br />Harry's fifth year as a wizard doesn't start too well, he and Dudley are attacked by dementors which leads to Harry being expelled from Hogwarts. Through a series of random, craziness Harry discovers that Dumbledore is putting together an army to help fight Voldemorts army. The Order of the Phoenix involve the likes of Azkaban runaway Sirius Black, Godfather of Harry Potter and Sirius Black. The Ministry of Magic are the biggest problem facing the order at the moment as Dumbledore and Harry are constantly attacked in the daily prophet for spreading lies. The Ministry are in denial that the Dark Lord Voldemort is back and in order to stop the rumours, they must take Dumbledores power and remove him as Hogwarts headmaster. In his place is the old fashioned and quite evil Professor Delores Umbridge. She, like the ministry seems in complete denial about the dark lords return and seeks to bring order to Hogwarts. Harry on the other hand decides he must take teaching into his own hands and puts together his own army of students and prepares them for the impending war.<br /><br />I have to be honest and say Radcliffe has once again really pulled it off as a genuine actor. Although the Harry Potter label will stick with him forever, he continues to display genuine acting talent within the role. The supporting best friends of Emma Watson (Hermione) & Rupert Grint (Ron) provide the general emotional guidance that helps keep Harry going. Personally I found the Delores Umbridge character to be the more intimidating of characters from this year, she has the ability of being a bit too sweet giving the image that you know there's something more going on. She demands order, she wants peace without possibility of injury so she bans all magic in the classroom and insists all theory work is the correct way to teach wizardry. Well played part by Imelda Staunton.<br /><br />The special effects are as usual astonishing, they allow the truly magical Potter world to come alive. The Centaurs, Giants and general magical fights can only be done through the magic of computer animation and are simply flawless. There wasn't a single moment where I spotted a faulty special effect with which I could say "that's done by computers." If it did have that effect on someone then there's no denying it would have ruined the entire effect of the film.<br /><br />I do want to point something out and it's something that has been talked about time and time again. It's the darkness of the film, for a book aimed at kids the stories tend to get more and more adult as time progresses. This is a good thing for the older fan of the books, but isn't something I would really say should be seen by kids as they would possibly find it a bit terrifying. It's an amazing, honest and enjoyable picture that although there will be the complaints of cutting down too much from the book, I have no doubt that it's still a film the loyal book fans will thoroughly enjoy.</p></body></html>

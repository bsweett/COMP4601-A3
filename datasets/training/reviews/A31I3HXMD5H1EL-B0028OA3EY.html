<meta name="summary" content="Bryan Singer's Soaring Vision of the Man of Steel..."></head><body><p>"Superman Returns", the long-awaited NEW chapter of the Superman Saga, rewrites Superman's cinema history, occurring after the events of "Superman II" (III and IV have been thankfully discarded), and a 5-year absence of the Man of Steel, as he explored the remains of Krypton, searching for something tangible from his past. The film introduces Brandon Routh (1979- ) as the latest incarnation of Krypton's Last Son, bearing an uncanny resemblance to Christopher Reeve while in the Kent identity, and an aloof, almost Christ-like benevolence as Superman.<br /><br />Director Bryan Singer and writers Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris ("X-Men" I and II) wanted to create not only an original new chapter in the Saga, but a sincere homage to Richard Donner's definitive first "Superman", as well, digitally inserting clips of Marlon Brando as Jor-El, utilizing John Williams' famous theme (for the fifth time in the franchise), showing pictures of 'Pa Kent' Glenn Ford on the the Kent Farm's mantle, and repeating key dialog from the first film (Superman's well-known advice about flying brought laughter and applause from theater audiences). While "Superman II" and "Superman III" composer Ken Thorne, and "Superman IV" composer Alexander Courage (who wrote the original "Star Trek" TV theme), had been hamstrung, creatively, by being forced to simply 'adapt' John Williams' soaring music into the sequels' storylines (with decreasing success, in each film), frequent Singer composer John Ottman actually expanded upon Williams' vision, adding his own themes and motifs, creating a score even more vaulting, heroic, and spiritual.<br /><br />To those critics who would claim "Superman Returns" followed the first Superman film too slavishly, there was a major change, barely noticed when the film debuted; the 'take' on the Man of Steel's superpowers came from the mid-eighties' comic book revamp of the character...No longer did Kal-El come to Earth already possessing "Powers and Abilities Far Beyond Mortal Men"; he, instead, was a Kryptonian solar "battery", powered by Earth's yellow sun, who would not manifest his abilities until sufficiently 'charged' (which was why young Clark would be seen in the film wearing glasses; he actually needed them, as he was quite frail...as would any child be, of Kryptonian heritage...baby Kal-El could never have lifted Pa Kent's truck, saving his life, in this version!)<br /><br />Superman would soon find that things had changed dramatically in his absence. Lois Lane (portrayed by Kate Bosworth as much calmer and more level-headed than Margot Kidder, though incongruously younger-looking), feeling betrayed by his never having said goodbye, has won a Pulitzer Prize for her editorial "Why the World Doesn't Need Superman", now shares her life with Perry White's nephew, Richard ("X-Men" star James Marsden), and has a frail five-year-old son (portrayed by young Tristan Lake Leabu, who is a pivotal character in the plotline). Lex Luthor (a very engaging if sinister Kevin Spacey), long released from custody (since key witness Superman never appeared at his trial to testify), bilks an aged millionairess (legendary 'Lois Lane' Noel Neill) on her deathbed, and uses his new fortune to return to the Fortress of Solitude and steal the Krypton crystals in the 'ultimate' land scheme. The only friendly faces around are his stepmother, Martha Kent (the always wonderful Eva Marie Saint), Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington), who, in a nostalgic scene, takes Clark to a bar run by Jack (TV's original 'Jimmy Olsen') Larson, and Perry White (played with rumpled charm and a twinkle in his eye, by Frank Langella).<br /><br />After a truly spectacular rescue sequence, involving a space shuttle, a disintegrating airplane, and a stadium full of people, Superman regains the public's confidence (another scene that brought cheers from the theater audience, the night I viewed the film)...but Lois would require far more time...and Luthor plans to kill billions, beginning with Superman.<br /><br />"Superman Returns" is a stunning, brilliantly conceived achievement, offering not only the expected (and superbly created) 'super heroics', but a deeply satisfying, uplifting 'morality tale', of life, death, and redemption, as well. Brandon Routh, while not as charismatic as Christopher Reeve, proves himself more than capable as the Man of Steel (although I DO prefer the old Superman uniform over the Speedo-inspired new look!)<br /><br />While I believe the first Christopher Reeve "Superman" movie is still the best film of the series, thus far, this newest production runs a very close second, in my opinion...<br /><br />With generally enthusiastic reviews, and a world-wide box office gross well over $350,000,000, there is definitely life in the Superman franchise, yet!</p></body></html>

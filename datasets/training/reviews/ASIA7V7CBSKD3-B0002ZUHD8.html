<meta name="summary" content="King of Myth"></head><body><p>This is a great movie.  Clive Owens does an excellend job playing King Arthur in this true-to-life (provide the legends are true) movie.  This is not the "Sword in the Stone" fairy tales we've heard and seen in the past and I greatly enjoy this tale.  Regardless of whether or not you believe any of this movie (I believe it) or not, you will be greatly entertained!</p></body></html>

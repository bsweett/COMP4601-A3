The woods simply seem more inherently frightening and dangerous than a suburban street for horny teens.  In any event, I feel that both of these series, especially Friday the 13th, have lost their lure in recent years.  Trying to find ways to bring back our favorite slashers and attempting to do it in contemporary fashion have fallen short, in my opinion.  I've remained a fan through it all, yet when they took Jason out of Camp Crystal Lake and brought him to New York City, he somehow became less imposing and some of the mystery was lost.<br /><br />Freddy vs. Jason was an idea borne years before this film began pre-production.  The premise of the film (Freddy calling on Jason to strike fear back into the children of Elm Street) is decent, but it seemed to me that something was missing...<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie, especially the dream sequences, but I couldn't put my finger on what was wrong with the film.  It just didn't feel like Friday the 13th to me.  It felt more like a Nightmare on Elm Street film, but even those movies were scarier.  This movie bordered on absurd at times and much of what we had come to know about Freddy and Jason was betrayed in this film by way of contradiction (i.e. Jason suddenly having a phobia of water after he had, on many occassions in the past, pursued people into the water to kill them).<br /><br />I am glad that this movie was made and I will always remain a fan, but I feel that with all of the time and writing that went into this idea, it could have been a hell of a lot better.  The story was not bad, but the movie was simply not scary or suspenseful at all.  It's a must see for any fan of either series, if for no other reason than to see what your favorite classic slasher is up to - but don't expect to get that good old feeling you used to get when watching a Friday the 13th or a Nightmare on Elm Street film back in the 80s and 90s.<br /><br />The bonus material is extensive and quite exhaustive.  They cover every aspect of the film, including pre-production, direction, stunts, visual effects, make-up, audio commentary, deleted scenes, storyboards and galleries, etc....  The bonus disc amounts to a few hours of extra viewing, which is actually pretty informative and insightful.  With cool, animated menus, this is a great DVD edition for something of a letdown film.</p></body></html>

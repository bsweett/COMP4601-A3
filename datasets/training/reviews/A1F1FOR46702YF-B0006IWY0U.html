Set in the early 19th Century during the Napoleonic Wars. Captain Jack Aubrey (Crowe) and the crew of the British warship HMS Surprise embark on a mission to intercept and destroy the French privateer Acheron. After narrowly escaping their first encounter with heavy damages and casualties, Captain Aubrey continues the pursuit of his powerful adversary into the Pacific Ocean. Directed by Peter Weir (Witness & The Truman Show), "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" is an outstanding well-crafted epic movie that successfully combines great storytelling and strong human drama. The visual effects are terrific. The climatic sea battle sequence is thrilling and very entertaining. Russell Crowe and Paul Bethany deliver great performances. "Master and Commander" was nominated for ten Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray release of "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" misses its mark. The 2003 war drama is presented in its theatrical 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The picture quality is certainly a noticeable improvement over the DVD but unfortunately it isn't a solid choice to show off your High-Def television. With its fine clarity and thunderous bass, the DTS-HD audio is the real winner in this release. Its only extras are six deleted scenes, a pop-up trivia track and the film's theatrical trailer. If you're looking for special features, the 2-disc Collector Edition DVD is a better choice. Overall, "Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World" gets a "B".</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Wow, is this really horrible!"></head><body><p>First of all, it is SLOW, very SLOW.  I thought it was about 6 hours long - which gave me plenty of time to think.  Did DaPalma think he was taking Chinatown and and L.A. Confidential and throwing them in a blender with a real-life hollywood mystery tacked on?  Not a good move.  This is as tedious as they come.  H. Swank should be forced to return her two Oscars.  Her over-the-top (unintentionally hillarious) performance makes Faye Dunaway in Mommie Dearest look subtle.  Nobody else fares any better.  I think they brought back Gloria Swanson to play Swank's mother! Save your time and money.  Or put it on when you need a good long nap!</p></body></html>

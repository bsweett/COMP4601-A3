<meta name="summary" content="Creating a State of Fear"></head><body><p>The film shows scientists in the antarctic, their tests show global warming is increasing. The paradoxical result will be a frozen earth! TV news shows snow in New Delhi, large hailstones fall in Tokyo. The strongest hurricane has been recorded. A scientist's young son has discovered the politics of education. Sensors measure drops in the ocean's temperature. Birds and animals are restless and disturbed. What in the world is happening? Tornadoes in Los Angeles destroying the city! People are squashed like bugs. Typhoons in Australia! Could the North Atlantic current be changed due to melting ice (fresh water)? [It was cute to have a President who resembled Al Gore. But is the rest of the film just as correct?]<br /><br />Their computer projections show a disaster is only 6 to 8 weeks away. The worst storms will soon be here. But the Vice President [looks like Dick Cheney] can't be bothered. The temperature dropped so fast people froze to death in Scotland. The water level has risen so fast New Foundland is flooded. Water is flooding the subways and tunnels of Manhattan. Is it the end of the world as we know it? A huge tidal wave hits New York City! [These special effects are really great!] Now super-cooled air is being pulled into the atmosphere to create a new Ice Age! Anyone who goes outside will be flash frozen. There is no escape for anyone. The southern states will be evacuated, there is no hope for those Yankees north of the Mason-Dixon line.<br /><br />[Hollywood films usually have a happy ending.]<br /><br />Back in the real world discussion continues on the effects of Global Warming. From the 10th to the 14th century the world was much warmer. Greenland was a green island where settlers lived on their crops. Southern England raised grapes for a wine industry. That changed in the 14th century, increasing cold led to food shortages, famine; then the Black Death killed over 30% of the population. [Read Barbara Tuchman's "A Distant Mirror" for one view of those times.]</p></body></html>

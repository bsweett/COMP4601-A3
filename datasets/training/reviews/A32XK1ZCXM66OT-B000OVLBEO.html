Who was just trying to have a normal life. Peter Fonda was great as the devil, who tricks Johnny into signing over his soul. I mean, if you watch this movie. You can tell that Peter Fonda was having fun playing the devil!!! Eva Mendes wasn't too bad as Roxanne, Johnny's girlfriend. Even Wes Bentley put in a good performance as Blackheart, the devil's son. Not bad for this movie!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Quite a Nice Film"></head><body><p>This is a movie about people whose experience with death (their own or others') transforms them.<br /><br />So in a sense it's a story about rebirth--but the rebirths are not at all what anyone expects.<br /><br />There are three stories, in three locations, and they eventually converge.<br /><br />In Paris, Marie LeLay has her world exploded by her drowning and resuscitation in a tsunami.  She can't stop thinking about her time in death, and it affects, and eventually destroys, her work, and her (apparently rich) life as a news interviewer and correspondent.<br /><br />In London, one of an indissoluble set of twins is killed, leaving the remaining brother hopeless and familyless (his mother leaves at the same time).<br /><br />In San Francisco, George Lonegan (Matt Damon), tries to begin a new life after years of heartbreaking work as a psychic connecting others to their dead loved ones.  (Lonegan himself got his "gift"--which he regards as a curse--after dying several times on the operating table as a child.)  But this life, too, shatters, when he reluctantly performs one last reading for a woman he meets in his Italian cooking class (Bryce Dallas Howard).  She is unnerved by his ability to see her childhood abuse, and she flees, and shortly after George is let go from his escapist factory job.<br /><br />With his severance money--job, hobby, and potential girlfriend gone--George decides to follow his love of Dickens to London.  (I knew I would love this movie when I heard George listening to a recording of David Copperfield--one mention of Peggoty, and I was hooked.)  Naturally, he runs into the bereaved twin boy, and also the French correspondent, who has written a book called "Hereafter" about her death-experience, and is at a London book fair.<br /><br />In some ways, the movie is like a Dickens novel--preposterous coincidences and shameless tugs on the heart.<br /><br />But that is all to the good, because it is genuinely moving and thought-provoking.<br /><br />All the characters develop, but not at all in ways that they, or we, can predict.</p></body></html>

For one thing the transfer is very strange - the brightness is pumped WAY too high. The orange credits-on-black looks incredibly washed out. The original laserdisc transfer looks better than this. There's MORE picture information on the sides of the frame than the previous widescreen transfer, so that's a plus. The audio commentary, while informative, is NOT screen-specific. It sounds like interviews from cast & crew edited together; not bad, if you like it that way. As for the supplements, someone thought it would be clever to present the interviews in a cutesy format. It does NOT work. Can you imagine any other crime film being treated like this? Of the better features are the commentaries by notable film critics like Peter Travers, et al.</p></body></html>

The plot simply is set up to go from "Point A" to "Point B" to move the story along with no twists to storyline or character development. Again, director Mark Steven Johnson creates another shallow relationship as he had done in his other comic book film adaption, DAREDEVIL (Matt Murdock & Elecktra). This time it is between characters Johnny Blaze & Roxanne Simpson (Nicholas Cage and Eva Mendes respectively). The CGI effects of the title character are terrific and it actually doesn't overtake the film which might not be a good thing because somehow the moviegoer is wanting more action with the Ghost Rider. Nick Cage seems to be phoning in his performance and channeling in variations from his past action movies (i.e. THE ROCK, CON AIR, & NATIONAL TREASURE). Eva Mendes simply cannot act and is terribly miscast as Roxanne Simpson. One would guess that since her character is somewhat of a reporter that she is a variation of a 'Lois Lane' to the title character and it ultimately falls short...big time. In a bit of inspired casting, Peter Fonda is cast as Mephistopheles, the demon who gives the Ghost Rider his persona, powers (and demon motorcycle chopper). Also, another bit of inspired casting is of Sam Elliott as Carter Slade who is a Ghost Rider from the old west who rides a demon horse. The best part of the movie is when the modern day Ghost Rider and the old west Ghost Rider are side by side going through the desert at night.  The rest of the film is not interesting with the plot of Mephistopheles' demon son wanting to take over his Dad's reign of terror and the Ghost Rider must stop him. This is a tired and cliched plot. Overall, another failed comic book movie adaption with tired plot devices and an uninteresting relationship of the comicbook character and the would-be girlfriend.</p></body></html>

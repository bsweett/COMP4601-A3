<meta name="summary" content="What's so racist about this movie?"></head><body><p>I don't see anything racist about this movie. The two main characters are nowhere near stereotypical asians (sure, Harold and Kumar are intelligent individuals, but they also like to get stoned). However, everyone should agree that this film makes fun of everyone (from white trash to over-achieving Asians to brutal cops to skinheads to whatever), so calling this racist because of (?) the minor stereotypical Asian characters that are present for only a few minutes is idiotic.<br /><br />Anyway, this film's flat-out hilarious. Hurry up and buy/rent it!</p></body></html>

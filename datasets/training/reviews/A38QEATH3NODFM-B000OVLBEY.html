<meta name="summary" content="entertaining, a fair movie, not the best comic book movies though."></head><body><p>I did make it out to see this movie finally, and it was, but not great. I like nicholas cage in this film, and funny to see peter fonda as the devil.  The action was decent, and the story was ok, but very comic book, didn't translate well to a movie. I loved the punisher, and the spider-man movies are entertainingly far fetched.  The acting just wasn't up to the level of those movies, and the story wasn't one of my facvorite comics.  so check it out, good for some entertainment, but not a must have in my opinion</p></body></html>

I experienced it the first week it came out in the theater, and on my way home was filled with giggling, weeping, and joy -- I was so happy Proyas hadn't compromised his artistic instinct enough to destroy such a vision.  Dark City deserves to be seen as a film, in a theater, and I  refuse to watch it on a television.  Roger Ebert's review of it has sustained my hope that not all movie critics are totally unlike me.<br /><br />Director's Cut:<br />09/28/10 Bluray<br /><br />I'm astounded how right on target the original cutting style was to what I'd wished it had been in the theater, where the cuts were a little too tight, too rhythmic, too MTV, too commercial advertisement in spots.  Too much brevity.  Not only does getting rid of that awful intro voice-over help (I didn't see that in the theater, as I came in slightly late as we move down into the city), but bringing back Jennifer Connelly's voice better suspends disbelief and the flow & development of everything is drastically, monumentally improved.  The story and concepts, admittedly some of them borrowed from alien abductions and noir-ized for artistic sake here, all are thoroughly fleshed-out, paced, and called back appropriately.  The rushed, abbreviated version was a truly great achievement, but this a mind-blowing &uuml;ber masterpiece.<br /><br />I did not experience any issues with sound, but I will say the Bluray is still lacking in what the theatrical prints portrayed.  There is some noticeable generational degradation and some video processing-induced motion blur in some of the footage used from the theatrical telecine, which appears to be from the same HD scan the original DVDs were downres'd from.  They seem to have just remastered that original telecine (not rescanned an interneg or interpos, let alone the original negs) with some unfortunate edge enhancement to further "spoof" its apparent quality.  It ends up looking almost embossed in spots, PAL-conversion-like motion blurry in others, and generally inconsistent in inherent fidelity of the visual information.<br /><br />Comparing the theatrical footage intermixed to the newer transfers of the added or extended footage that they co-exist with, you can see marked differences in fidelity from moment to moment.  It does look superior to the DVD, yet is still vastly inferior (not just resolution or visual dynamic range) to the brand spanking new print I saw in an enormous auditorium when it first came out.  The contrasts will certainly improve with plasma screens, OLED, pro grade CRTs, or if you make prints from this disk and show it in a pitch black room.  But there is more lost here than just what is the result of your budget LCD display.<br /><br />I would hope one of these days the money is spent to re-scan the negatives and do a new digital intermediary, digital composites of the virtual effect plates, and not only bring that out on Bluray (or whatever the standard is at the time) but back into the theaters.  This film never had the appreciation it deserved and this intended version is one of the few instances where the "director's cut" is not just some unnecessary, drawn-out indulgence that lacks elegance.  It had that elegance before it was tampered with.  Test screenings and executives meddling: for shame.  You cut and alter a film down to the lowest common denominator, and the result is less, not more.  Most people are tasteless, moronic sheep who would just assume gas you under Hitler's orders or be spoon fed Britney Spears & endless Michael Bay sequels for the rest of their lives.  Art requires purity.  Don't expect great art to have mass appeal.</p></body></html>

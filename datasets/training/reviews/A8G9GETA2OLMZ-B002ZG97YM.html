<meta name="summary" content="Wanted to Like It, But . . ."></head><body><p>I wanted to like this movie.<br /><br />And it does have engaging things.<br /><br />The Night Fury dragon, Toothless, that Hiccup adopts is cute and likable.  In the commentary, the animators talk a long time about how hard they had to work to fashion a cute, yet still scary, face.<br /><br />One look at "Stitch" from "Lilo and Stitch" will show that they needn't have worked so hard.  They could have stolen Stitch's (maybe they did).<br /><br />Likewise, the moral is engaging: better to understand and befriend than demonize and kill.<br /><br />Also, Astrid is cute, and the love-story is humorously un-romantic.<br /><br />But still, I had a hard time liking it.<br /><br />One reason was Jay Baruchel's voice for Hiccup.  In the commentary, Baruchel becomes effusive with what a super, great, life-changing and world-changing movie this was.  But it isn't.  I can't tell if Baruchel actually believes this, or is just protesting too much.  Baruchel gets the "Christian-Slater-Talk-Alike" award, but his whinyness gets old fast.<br /><br />Another reason is the static appearance of Stoick, Hiccup's father.  Yes, he is mildly engaging, but only mildly.  The animators talk at length about what a breakthrough he is, but his braided beard and furry coat look merely painted on, and his body moves like a robot.<br /><br />The dragons are uniformly cute and interesting, but the human characters are uniformly monotonous.<br /><br />Despite the raves of all the people who worked on the movie (in the commentary), really it is nothing special to look at.  And even if it were, mere appearance can never make up for mediocre characters.</p></body></html>

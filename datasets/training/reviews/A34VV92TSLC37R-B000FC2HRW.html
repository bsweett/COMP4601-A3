<meta name="summary" content="A step down from number 2"></head><body><p>I love the first two Final Destination movies.  It was an original idea, and it was executed extremely well.  The car crash sequence in Final Destination 2 is one of the best I've ever seen on film.  Number 2 was also great because of its ridiculously elaborate ways to kill characters.  And the gore was some of the best in recent horror to top it all off.  The  first movie was more about plot and characters, but still had some intense moments and good kills.<br /><br />Needless to say, I was excited to see the third entry in what I am hoping becomes a franchise the likes of Friday the 13th or Freddy (I'm talking number of movies here, not quality-wise).  Normally I don't let myself get too excited for a movie, because I am always let down.  Well that's what happened here.  I got myself all pumped up and excited, then as the movie progressed, it just didn't do anything for me.  There were a couple moments where I was like "that was cool," but nothing that made my jaw drop like in the second film.<br /><br />You all know the premise.  Main character has premonition of horrible death sequence (a roller coaster crash in this case), and gets people off of the ride and saves their lives.  However, Death then comes calling, in the order of how they would have died in the original incident, all the survivors start being knocked off in inconceivable, horrendous ways.  The roller coaster sequence was pretty cool, but the movie was basically downhill after that.  I got to the point where I was just counting down the minutes until the next death scene.  In the previous two, I was at least interested enough to pay attention to what the characters were saying, but at this point, how to avoid your death has been rehashed three times, and I think that's plenty.  If they are planning on making another one of these films, I suggest a new perspective on the story, because even I, a fan of the series, felt a litte tired of it after leaving the theater.</p></body></html>

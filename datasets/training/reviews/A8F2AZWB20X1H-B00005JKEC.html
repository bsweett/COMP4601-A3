It's as if they were able to tap into the dark side that lurks inside all of us in varying degrees, and play it to the hilt while enjoying every minute of it.  Richard Gere playing a venal cop in "Internal Affairs".  Ralph Fiennes as a loathsome concentration camp commander in "Schindler's List", and playing the ultimate bad guy as Harry Potter's nemesis Voldemort.  Humphrey Bogart as Dobbs in "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre".  And now comes Denzel Washington, usually the squeaky-clean hero of whatever film he's in, giving a bang-up performance as Alonzo Harris, a LAPD detective who is rotten to the core.<br /><br />"Training Day" chronicles one momentous day, from dawn to midnight, in the lives of two cops.  Jake Hoyt is a newly minted detective, anxious to make the grade in Alonzo Harris's elite narcotics squad, who takes "Serve And Protect" seriously.  He rides shotgun with Alonzo for the day.  Alonzo is going to break him in to what being a narcotics detective is about.  But Jake finds out that Alonzo has his own code that has nothing to do with serving or protecting, and everything to do with exploiting the people he's supposed to serve and protect.  He robs the dealers and steals their cash.  He breaks into people's homes with fake warrants.  "I got 'em all under my thumb", he brags about the inhabitants of the Los Angeles ghettos.  We soon realize that Alonzo's superiors have allowed him to do pretty much whatever he wants to do as long as he doesn't embarrass them by getting caught.  But Alonzo has his own problems, which require prompt resolution -- a very expensive weekend in Las Vegas left the Russian mafia into him for one million dollars, payable by midnight if he wants to live to see the dawn, and he's not past doing whatever he has to in order to come up with that sum, including armed robbery and homicide.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke gives the performance of a lifetime as Jake Hoyt, the idealistic, impressionable young detective who very soon realizes he's riding a tiger he may not be able to shake loose.  It can't be like this, he protests to Alonzo. But Alonzo responds, that's how it is; deal with it.  And Jake is left alone to somehow find his way out of this mess and salvage his own integrity in the process.<br /><br />Along with Hawke and Washington, some minor characters give some outstanding performances.  Chief among them are Scott Glen as Roger, Alonzo's erstwhile friend who has something he very much wants; Cliff Curtis, a hitherto unknown Maori actor from New Zealand who gives a devastating performance as Smiley, the Latino thug from the Hillside Trece gang whom Alonzo sets up to waste Jake, once he realizes there is a limit to his venality past which Jake refuses to cross, at which point Jake becomes a liability; Eva Mendes as one of Alonzo's four babymommies, and Cle Sloan as Bone, the South Central gangbanger who makes Alonzo finally realize that maybe he doesn't have them all under his thumb the way he thought he did.<br /><br />The film gets off to a fairly slow start but after the first fifteen minutes it hits warp speed and never lets up.  Antoine Fuqua directed a great movie that is a star vehicle for two outstanding actors.  It's an ugly picture, and we want to protest along with Jake that it can't be this way, but we have to agree with Alonzo that maybe, sometimes, it is.<br /><br />Judy Lind</p></body></html>

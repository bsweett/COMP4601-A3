<meta name="summary" content="Great Imaginative Film!!"></head><body><p>I went to see Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland the day it opened in theaters. I'm a fan of Burton films and I waited a long time to see this film. I wasn't dissapointed. The visuals are gorgeous and really creative, Wonderland is in one word "fantastic", the characters blend effortessly in the Wonderland scenery (sorry Underland). The plot is predictable but the performances of the characters make this a truly engaging experience. Johhny Depp is fantastic as the Mad Hatter as is Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen and Anne Hathaway as the White Queen. Crispin Glover also was good as the Knave of Hearts. The vocal performances for the animated characters are top-notch (especially Alan Rickman as the Caterpillar (Absolem) and Stephen Fry as the Chesire Cat). Mia Wasikowska gave an excellent first impression in the title role. As conclusion, Disney and Burton delivered an imaginative, visually stunning, well performed film.<br /><br />The Bluray/DVD/Digital Copy combo is excellent. The picture looks stunning in Bluray and Wonderland is gorgeus. The sound is equally impressive. An excellent transfer. The DVD, loses some of the richness in hi def but nonetheless is an excellent transfer for SD. The extras are a little short in time but they will entertain you. An excellent combo for a nice film.</p></body></html>

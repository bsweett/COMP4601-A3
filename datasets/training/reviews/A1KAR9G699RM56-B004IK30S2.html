<meta name="summary" content="Anchorman for old anchor days"></head><body><p>Will Ferrell, a particularly humorous person in my opinion, has created the partially witty but mostly overt throwback to those old days of anchoring.  When men were men, and they thought women were too.  Now, that is not true.  It is interesting however that, although portrayed in a comedic manner, gender segregation was a component of early broadcasting.  History aside, Anchorman was creative, albeit not the wittiest piece of work in film.  Enjoyable, maybe if only for the first viewing, this film still has some shine.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Iron-Man gets it right. Looking forward to more."></head><body><p>Iron-Man doesn't mess it up when it could have been easy to do so and Robert Downey Jr is on top form in a story about him being a multi-billionaire weapons tycoon who finds his products used against Americans and so develops an Iron-Man suit to combat Muslim terrorists that kidnapped him, killed his friend and tried to use his technology in ways that he didn't foresee. Things go from bad to worse when he finds his company has been double-dealing and business partners have turned bad.<br /><br />In short Iron-Man is Robocop for young adults but Downey Jr actually puts on a worthwhile performance that overshadows when he puts on the suit. Even with the suit on the flying through the sky moments are well worth the wait and while the fights and finale are kept on a somewhat small scale they are still good.<br /><br />Overall Iron-Man delivers on an interesting balance of action and content. If you like quality superhero movies then you can't go wrong with this.</p></body></html>

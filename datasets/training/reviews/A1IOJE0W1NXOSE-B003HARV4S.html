<meta name="summary" content="Exquisite movie!"></head><body><p>The young son of a cabinet-maker(Edward Norton) becomes acquainted with Sophie, the daughter of a wealthy man for whom his father works.  They are inseparable until their parents decide that their friendship is unsuitable and they forbid them to see each other.  The young man travels the world and learns the art of being an illusionist, while the young girl grows up and is to be betrothed to the Crown Prince of Austria.  They meet again and discover that their attraction is as strong as ever, but they are threatened by the cruel Crown Prince who has no intention of letting Sophie go.  This is an exquisite movie in every way.  It is beautifully filmed, wonderfully written, and well-acted.  There are moral questions, particularly with regard to the Chief Inspector who is under the wing of the Crown Prince, and questions as to how the illusions in the movie are done.  Rather than detracting from the film, all of this creates a perfect mood and setting for a highly entertaining movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Man Of Steel "Returns" - The Results Are A Mixed Bag Of Kryptonite"></head><body><p>"You wrote that the world doesn't need a savior, but, everyday I hear people crying for one."<br />- The Man Of Steel tells (on again, off again girlfriend) Lois Lane one of the many reasons why "Superman Returns"<br /><br />Twenty-five summers after the release of "Superman II" & another roughly ten to fifteen years trying to get the project off the ground, Superman finally makes the leap back to the big screen in the aptly titled "Superman Returns". The results are mixed (I actually give the film ***1/2 stars).<br /><br />After the events of "Superman II", "Superman Returns" starts off with the Man Of Steel returning to Earth after a five year absence. It looked like astronmers had found the remains of what looked to be the burnt out planet of Krypton, Supes' his homeworld & Kal-El had to find out if anyone was home. Finding out that he truly is the last of his people, Superman returns to his real home, Earth.<br /><br />As for Superman's arch-nemesis Lex Luthor, he's free after Superman fails to show up for his parole hearing.<br /><br />"How much do you think that pisses off Superman?", asks Jimmy Olsen.<br /><br />"A lot.", replies an unamused Clark Kent, stunned by the news.<br /><br />Lex is also back in the green after swindling an inheritance from a millionairess, early on in the film.<br /><br />In the wake of Superman's mysterious dissapearance, the people of Metropolis realize that maybe they don't need a Superman afterall. That's the big question that Big Blue has to face. Will people accept his return? Do they really need him?<br /><br />Things don't actually look up for Clark Kent on his return to "The Daily Planet". Sure, he got his old job back, but, it's a one two punch that sends him to the local bar, in search of a drink, after finding out that Lois Lane has written a Pulitzer Prize winning essay on why the world doesn't need Superman, has moved on with her life with her five year old son & is engaged to Richard White, Perry's nephew, associate editor to "The Daily Planet", & father (?) to Lois' son.<br />It's at the local sports bar, having a beer with Jimmy Olsen (the only one that seems happy to see him back), & a dangerous mishap with a NASA space shuttle, that Clark Kent makes up his mind to bring Superman back into the public eye.<br /><br />While most of the people of Earth embrace the return of Superman, two people aren't happy to see his arrival.<br /><br />Lois Lane, originally, heartbroken & now, angry has quite a few questions for her former boyfriend.<br /><br />As for Lex Luthor, he's making a huge land grab that will sink most of America underwater, thanks to some Kryptonian crystals pilfered from Superman's Fortress Of Solitude & Kryptonite stolen from a local museum.<br /><br />Of course, it's not a Superman film without Lois getting into trouble & all hell breaking loose thereafter. After some snooping around, trying to find out the cause of a mysterious citywide blackout, Lois, with her son in tow, accidently lands on a yacht that belongs to a freshly showered millonaire.<br /><br />"Lex Luthor."<br />"Lois Lane?!"<br />"Your bald."<br /><br />It's up to Superman to save Lois, her son (who may or might not have the White family blood running through him), & the U.S. of A from Lex Luthor's "Century 21" making disaster.<br /><br />"Superman Returns" is one of those films that should be epic & fun, but, comes off big & by the numbers. I expected a lot more from director, Bryan Singer. There are quite a few loopholes to the film. "Returns" can't hold a match to the first two "Superman" films (those are still tops).<br /><br />"Superman Returns"' main & ultimately crippling problem is that it lacks the charm, warmth, & humor of "Superman: The Movie" & "Superman II" & this problem spreads throughout the film's lead charcter's. The chemistry between Lois & Superman is practically non-existent (they don't even kiss for God's sake!), & the big battle between Lex & Supes is lame & could be akin to a New York gang mugging.<br /><br />Brandon Routh does a passable job in the title role, but, in some scenes it seems as if Routh is doing an empty impression of Reeve. The classic Superman flyby that ends each "Super" film is mechanically done here. Oddly, of all the character's in the film Superman gets the least lines. The scenes where Superman secretly looks in on Lois & her family, & the scene where he watches, what might be his own son, sleeping are actually, & I hate to say it, a bit creepy.<br /><br />Kate Bosworth is too young to be playing Lois Lane. Her Lane is more of a smoking, soccer mom than a hard-nosed reporter. The thin plotline of Lois' son possibly being Superman's is just ludicrous. Remember, Superman gave up his powers in "II" in order to be with Lois. Only after learning about the Phantom Zone criminals taking over the world, did Supes go back & retrieve his super powers.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor is one of the saving graces of "Superman Returns" (the action scenes are the other saving grace). His Luthor is more inline with Gene Hackman's portrayal than Spacey admits. However, Spacey doesn't bring that sense of menace that both Hackman & Michael Rosenbaum (Luthor in "Smallville") to their roles.  The scene where Luthor discovers Lois & her son aboard his yacht & the scene on the island near film's end are priceless. Parker Posey is dissmissable as Kitty (Posey was better as Gail Weathers in "Scream 3"). Valerie Perrine's, Miss Teschmacher & Ned Beatty's, bumbling Otis are sorely missed.<br /><br />The action scenes are pretty much what makes "Superman Returns" worth watching, especially the shuttle/airplane sequence.<br /><br />Superman's return is a welcome one but it's not an epic one.<br /><br />"Superman Returns" flies home on DVD on November 28, 2006. Two editions will be available both in the 2.40:1 film aspect ratio. The first is either wide or full screen & contains just the film. The 2 disc edition has "Requiem For Krypton" - a 3 hr. doc on the making of "Superman Returns" & other features.</p></body></html>

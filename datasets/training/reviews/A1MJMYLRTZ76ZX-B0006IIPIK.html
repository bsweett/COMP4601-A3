<meta name="summary" content="A brief comment on the design"></head><body><p>Sky Captain is a beautifully designed and convincingly rendered movie based on the stylistic concepts of the early Golden Age of Science Fiction, which started in the 30s and ended in the 60s with the arrival of the so-called New Wave. Much of the visual style owes its inspiration to the work of several architects and designers of the period. Huge Ferriss, an architect, drew beautiful charcoal drawings and portraits of a futuristic, high-rise New York that were very popular and appeared as illustrations in many important magazines of the day. Two other influences that were significant were Norman Bel Geddes, an industrial designer, and Raymond Loewy.<br /><br />The flying platform in the movie derives from one of Bel Geddes's most ambitious concepts, a nine story high amphibious airliner that incorporated open recreation areas, space for a symphony orchestra, two airplane hangers, a gymnasium and a solarium. Loewy is remembered for designs that have influenced almost every aspect of American life, including Air Force One, NASA's Skylab space station, Frigidaire freezers, washers, and ovens, the redesign of the original Coke Bottle, the Lucky Strike cigaret package, many diesel locomotive designs, Studebaker automobiles, and the Greyhound Scenicruiser bus, to mention some of his most important projects.<br /><br />The streamlined art deco design of the period owes a great deal to the work of these three men, and was the reason that everything from cars to Buck Rogers's rocket ship had the same look. The film brilliantly recaptures the zeitgeist and overall look and feel of this period of the Golden Age. I think the film is worth seeing if only for that. But the special effects and action are also great and make this a fun movie to see even if you're not a fan of Art Deco architecture and the old Sci-Fi pulp magazines.</p></body></html>

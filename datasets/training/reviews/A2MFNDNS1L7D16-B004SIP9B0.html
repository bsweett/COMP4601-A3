<meta name="summary" content="I found myself supporting the queen's position."></head><body><p>Apparently the British public is just as foolish over the cult of celebrity as the U.S. I put Diane in about the same category as those other one name wonders like Paris or Brittany or Lindsey. Whatever she was, it was totally as the result of being the wife of the next king of Britain & the mother of the heir, with a spare. Those pseudo-mourners who hate the royals need to remember without a monarchy, Diane would have been a cute, kindergarten teacher from a prominent family. Her charitible works, eliminating land mines, helping people with AIDS could have been done by anyone if given her oppotunities. The first one, marrying into the royal family & the second, sleeping with the son of one of the richest men in the world. That royalty should even exist as parasites on the British people, the fact is they do. Therefore the people demanded the Queen grieve as they did. Give her grandsons up to be viewed & pitied. It was not her way. Helen Mirren was dead on as the Queen, as was Michael Sheen as the PM, Tony Blair. Always the politician, Blair was instrumential in convincing the Queen into making a statement concerning Diane's death, as he did. The monarchy does move toward modernity at glacial speed. The evolution from the Queen Mum, to Elizabeth, to Charles is evident in this movie. He considers himself a modern man. Even 10 years ago...not. His son, William also a future King, is. Although this movie takes place in a short period of time in 1997 you get a lot of inside information on the monarchy & the life of Elizabeth II. I think she is loved, & respected as maybe representing not the way things are but once were. Maybe not such a bad thing. If you're an Anglophile, watch the commentary version after the movie.</p></body></html>

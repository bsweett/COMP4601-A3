<meta name="summary" content="What A Great 40th Edition Of This Classic Film Dead."></head><body><p>I like many other night of living dead fans i have  been scratching my head over which version of this film to get. because it seems like every tom,dick and harry who is in film company biz has release their version  of this classic film, which explain  why there are so many versions. it's a headache too choose which one to get, i know george and his associates are bit upset over this problem too. well i got this version because it was endorsed by george himself and was filled with goodies that the others didn't have like  duane jones last interview in audio form on this DVD which  is great and all the other extra have interviews with the surviving cast members of this classic dead film. showing where they shot most of key shots in the film and fun  stuff like that, plus the film has been cleaned up with the scratches and dirt removed from so it looks as if it was shot today with exception of the vintage automobiles etc. it is a pristine print ,  clear and vivid . This definitely  the one to get out of all the ones on the market.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.</p></body></html>

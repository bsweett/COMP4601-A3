From the Japanese soldiers view, they were dead man. They did not expect to survive. Still they fought to the end.<br /><br />The film explains the battle well as is the strategic position that Japanese faced. I though the acting was reasonable although not brilliant. The characters well developed. I think the acting let it down a bit.<br /><br />The filming is good.<br /><br />It shows that Japanese troops with as the write up said with strength, honour and courage. Still it is a shame in his earlier movie "Flags of our Fathers" Clint Eastwood did not use his talent to show the American troops going though similar suffering in that battle with these virtues too.</p></body></html>

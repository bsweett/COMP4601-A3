<meta name="summary" content="Not Bad, but Not Great either"></head><body><p>Superman Returns was a bit of a disappointment, considering the hype, though by no means is it a bad movie.<br /><br />After taking an unexpected and abrupt leave of absence, Superman returns to find out that things are not as he had left them...<br /><br />In short, the acting is pretty good (though nothing great), the setting is the familiar Superman setting, the special effects are very good, while the dialogues and the plot are just average.<br /><br />The major setbacks are in relation to:<br /><br />1) The mediocre plot and the average dialogues, for which the writers are to blame.  Specifically, turning the film into a soap opera was such a letdown!<br /><br />2) Kate Bosworth was not that great as Lois.  Just as uninteresting were the actors playing the minor roles.<br /><br />3) Why did the little boy have to look like a little girl???<br /><br />4) Apart from being given terrible lines, Kevin Spacey was surprisingly not that good.<br /><br />Though the potential for an amazing movie was definitely there it fails to take off, primarily due to the writers.<br /><br />The very good special effects in conjunction with the fact that it's (lovable) superman after all and that Brandon Routh does have potential are just about the only things worth while.<br /><br />Let's hope the next one is better.</p></body></html>

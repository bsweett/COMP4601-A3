<meta name="summary" content="a very gripping movie"></head><body><p>robocop is explosive from beginning to end. from the very beginning where he is human to where he gets gunned down(the shooting doesn't last very long on DVD as it did on the big screen- that's my only complaint)to where he becomes transformed into robocop and he then exacts revenge on those that killed him and then on dick jones after he gets fired from OCP. this is non-stop action, but also lots of violence and foul language. i would not recommend it to anyone under 13.</p></body></html>

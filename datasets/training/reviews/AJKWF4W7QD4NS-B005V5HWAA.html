<meta name="summary" content="Some intriguing moments, but ultimately falls flat"></head><body><p>Mr. Brooks takes an interesting stance on the whole psychological thriller/serial killer genre, with Kevin Costner in the title role.  Earl Brooks is a successful businessman with a loving wife (Marg Helgenberger) and daughter (Danielle Panabaker) who is unexpectedly home from college.  Unbeknownst to them though is that Earl is addicted to murder; an addiction which he has unsuccessfully tried to keep in check.  To make matters worse, he's being blackmailed by a slimy individual (comedian Dane Cook) looking for a thrill, and trailed by a millionaire cop (Demi Moore, yes you read that right).  While it offers some good moments (mostly from William Hurt, who appears as Mr. Brooks' murderous alter ego), the majority of Mr. Brooks falls flat thanks to the somewhat convoluted and above all non-sensical story.  Costner himself is good once again in a villainous role, and William Hurt is a blast in a film he has far too few appearances in.  Dane Cook is more annoying than anything else, while Demi Moore is about as believable as Demi Moore can be.  The film does offer a small twist at the end, but for the most part, Mr. Brooks is a mediocre thriller that could have been better than it is.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Arnold Goes To Mars..."></head><body><p>In spite of a few ridiculous aspects (some ultra-cheezy sfx, Arnold in a dress, etc.), TOTAL RECALL is one of the better sci-fi / hyper-action movies. Paul Verhoeven (Robocop, Starship Troopers) is the master of cinematic overkill done right. In his hands, a simple story about the reliability of memory becomes a titanic tale of conspiracy and inter-planetary adventure. Arnold is Douglas Quaid, construction worker and husband of Lori (Sharon Stone!!!). Or is he? One day, Quaid sees an ad for a company called, Rekall, that offers "trips" to places through memory implantation. Quaid wants to go to Mars, which has long been colonized, and goes through the implant procedure. Something goes wrong, and actual memories arise in Quaid's mind about Mars! Or do they? This leads to Quaid's being pursued by a nefarious gaggle of ne'er-do-wells led by one of my all-time favorite baddies, Michael Ironside (Starship Troopers, Scanners, Visiting Hours)! We end up on the martian surface for an all out explosion of bullets, blood, and mutants! Ronnie Cox (Robocop, The Beast Within) co-stars as the slimy corporate boss. Wow! This movie takes me back to those golden years when Arnold had an invincible streak of blockbusters! It's all part of his diabolical plan for global dominion! Just wait, he'll find a way to be president yet...</p></body></html>

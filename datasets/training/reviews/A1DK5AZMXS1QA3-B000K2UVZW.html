<meta name="summary" content="LA Confidential on crack"></head><body><p>The Black Dahlia was a famous murder of a young lady named Elizabeth Short, Betty, that occurred in Hollywood in the 1940s.  The case remains unsolved, and spawned multiple books, one of which is the basis for this movie.  The movie itself uses the murder and the ensuing investigation to explore multiple facets of LA society at that time; a corrupt LAPD, the criminal underworld, the rich and famous, the ultra-rich and secretive, and the various women who migrated to LA hoping for stardom but ending up with less admirable fates.  Several themes from the real life case show up in this movie as sub-themes that control events.  These include the power of the press and the hidden but common intersections between police officers and criminals.  The plot of the movie is quite intricate, and offers many twists and turns that are totally unexpected.  All the main characters are portrayed as corruptible or corrupted, and personal loyalties are often abused, if not outright betrayed.  Unlike real life, the murder is solved here, and nobody could have possibly guessed who it was until the murderer reveals him/her self.<br /><br />This movie is set to look and feel like LA Confidential, with the gorgeous babes and everyone smoking, but does not come across quite the same.  First and foremost, the violence here occurs in many forms, while it was mainly gun play in LA Confidential.  Second, the girls are really wicked here.  Third, no one seems to really know what everyone else is up to.  DVD's now come with special features as a given.  For this DVD, I was hoping for an  in-depth comparison between the movie, the book it was based on, and actual events.  This is not provided; we only get a superficial comparison of the movie to actual events that is narrated by the book's author.  Overall, an OK movie that is worth the time to watch, but not the movie to buy.</p></body></html>

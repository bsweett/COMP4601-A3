But still, you have to ask yourself: how memorable was Hannibal Rising if I forgot about it while listing out the movies I'd seen this weekend to review, and not remembered to add it to that list for over an hour?<br /><br />Now, I'll admit that I'm judging this movie more harshly than I otherwise would because it's from the long-bleeding and damned-close-to-dead Hannibal franchise, but screenwriter Harris (adapting from his own novel) and director Webber (Girl with a Pearl Earring) really invite that sort of thing; there are little visual clues to the other movies littered throughout, including the infamous scene of a young Lecter (A Very Long Engagement's Gaspard Ulliel) trying on the bottom half of the samurai mask, which directly resembles the masked forced upon Anthony Hopkins in the Silence of the Lambs. Even that would be forgivable if the armor ever ended up being more than set decoration in this movie. But no-- it's there for the sole purpose of throwing the audience a biscuit. Really, what can you say to that?<br /><br />Divorced from the mythology, it would probably be a serviceable little thriller, a kind of I Spit on Your Grave-lite. Lecter and his family are living in Lithuania in 1944-- not a very nice place to be, as the Germans and the Russians are about to collide on their doorstep. Eight-year-old Hannibal, his younger sister Mischa, and his mother and father, along with some servants, retreat to the country house just before the Germans, with some SS-wannabe tagalongs headed by Grutas (Danny Deckchair's Rhys Ifans), get to Lecter Castle and start murdering the help. Through various chains of coincidence, the surviving Lecters and Grutas' band both end up barricaded in the country house, where bad things happen, and Hannibal vows revenge. Yeah, you've heard it all a million times before. And it works, kind of, in the sense that you know what's coming within a few minutes of the opening (really, if you've seen the rest of the movies in the canon, you knew what was coming from the moment you first heard this movie was in production). In that respect, it's analogous to any of the Friday the 13th or Halloween sequels; you're looking forward to the next inventive death, rather than worrying about such details as plot, characterization, etc. All of which do exist here as a kind of thin veneer, so at least it ranks above any Friday the 13th after the second one.<br /><br />One high point n the movie bears mentioning, though. I've been seeing more and more of Richard Brake (who here plays one of Grutas' underlings) recently, usually in really, really bad movies. But the more I see of the guy, the more I like him. He's wonderful at playing slime. One of these days, he's going to break out and become "that guy you know, but can never remember his name," like William Fichtner. Be ready, you can say you knew him when.<br /><br />Other than that, really, as long as you can turn your brain off for two hours and aren't terribly insulted by Harris' pandering, you'll have some fun with this. **</p></body></html>

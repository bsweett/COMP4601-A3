<meta name="summary" content="JOE WRIGHT, OPUS 2"></head><body><p>***1/2 2007. Based on Ian McEwan's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307388840">Atonement</a> and directed by Joe Wright. Earned two Golden Globes ((Best Drama and Musical Score) and Academy award in the musical score category. England in 1935. A young student is sent to jail on account of the testimony of a 13 year old girl. Four years later, he chooses to join the army on behalf of prison. The first hour of ATONEMENT is a little jewel dealing with what is left unsaid and delusion. I was less enthralled by the second half of the movie with its war scenes and the character played by Romola Garai that didn't have the mysterious and multi-level aura of Briony Tallis at age 13. Notwithstanding this critical remark, I recommend this film.</p></body></html>

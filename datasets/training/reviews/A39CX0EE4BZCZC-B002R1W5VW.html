<meta name="summary" content="Different & Entertaining......But Where's The Justice?"></head><body><p>This was a bit different: a con movie that stays pretty low-key with some humor and a nice father-daughter story and then - wham - the last half hour it turns violent and very serious.<br /><br />****possible spoilers ****Frankly, I didn't particularly care for the last few minutes. I'm not opposed to forgiveness, it's what we all are supposed to do, but I also am a proponent of justice....which doesn't happen here with Allison Lohman's role as "Angela."<br /><br />All the characters are very interesting and the story is involving. It hooks you in early on, and keeps your wondering what will happen. There is a nice soundtrack to this film, too, and the camerawork is first-rate. The bad news is that, once again we see a film in which they make good guys out of crooks and the lead good guy "Roy Waller" (Nicholas Cage) smokes the whole movie. When is Hollywood to stop promoting bad things (like smoking)?<br /><br />Overall, if you are looking for something entertaining and a little bit different, this is recommended.</p></body></html>

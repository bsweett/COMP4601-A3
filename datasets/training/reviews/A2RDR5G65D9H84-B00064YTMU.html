<meta name="summary" content=""Why don't you take the cab?""></head><body><p>What a year for Jamie Foxx! Not only he delivered an unbelievable performance in "Ray", but also, in a completely different genre, he shines in the role of Max, a cab driver in a less than agreeable situation. Besides having Foxx, this movie counts with the always-dependable Tom Cruise, an action packed and intense script and interesting cinematography.<br /><br />Max is a grinder who drives a cab for a living and dreams with having his own limo business and spending his holidays in his perfect island. He is a nice guy, likes to talk with his customers and generates a sense of trust in everyone he meets. After driving a glamorous prosecutor to her offices, Max gets Vincent (Cruise) as his ride, a guy that offers a considerable amount of money to rent the cab for the night. Even though it is illegal to do this, Max is too tempted to refuse, and thus his torment begins.<br /><br />Things get interesting after the first stop, when a body falls from the sky on top of the cab and Max realizes that Vincent is a killer for hire. As expected, Max tries to get away, offering Vincent the car and promising not to say anything, but that does not fly. From that moment on we embark on a thrilling ride, but one that is surprisingly different from the typical action movie, because we get to take a real look into the psyche of the two main characters. This makes the movie really interesting and the good vs. bad guy line gets a little blurry.<br /><br />This intense psychological thriller delivers what it promises, a fair amount of entertainment, and more. The fact that towards the end, the action turns a little bit over the top is not a huge drawback. Another positive feature this film has in addition to Foxx and Cruise is the presence of Javier Bardem, the Spaniard actor, who shows that he can grant proof of his talent in just a couple of scenes. This is definitely one of the best action movies of the year.</p></body></html>

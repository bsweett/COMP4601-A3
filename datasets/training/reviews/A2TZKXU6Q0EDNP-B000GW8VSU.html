<meta name="summary" content="Demme-urian boredette.."></head><body><p>While the ending of this film was basically given away somewhere in the first half hour of it, there was indeed one big surprise for the viewer: that director J.Demme delivered such a sad mediocrity.<br /><br />  With the storyline offering great possibilities for a great and very dark atmospheric film, Demme and the other contributors managed to make a boring saga that will have you reach for the fast-forward button in desperation.<br /><br />  The story is indeed full of holes (as other reviewers mention as well) and on another surprising note D.Washington is actually pretty mediocre here too. Someone either forgot to tell the scriptwriter or Washington himself that being brainwashed does NOT mean walking around in total stupor and half asleep.<br /><br />That is really one part of the film that borders bad comedy as Washington's interpretation of the brainwashed veteran trying to find out who's pulling the strings behind the New Order plot he's unwillingly involved in is simply horrible.<br /><br />  To make things unbearably worse, you know far too early what the actual score is (and if you failed to figure it out early enough i'm stupified myself). But that's not the main problem. That would be that the film is so unengaging that even if it did manage to keep its plot twist unrevealed till the end it would still be boring.<br /><br />  Aside of Merryl Streep who's probably the only bright spot of this flick, the casting is actually a disaster. The senator candidate looks like someone out of a toothpaste commercial and acts like someone out of a toothpaste commercial. Granted, some politicians do look and act that way, but this is not what this film needed. The rest of the cast are simply putting in a good day's work, grab the check and go home.<br /><br />  The biggest failure here is by far the script. Had the script been adequate the actors would've (perhaps) put in a better and more engaging performance. But that's as iffy as the plot itself if not more so. In a film like this, where the storyline has to be super tight in order to capture the audience it's exactly that element that falls loudly apart. Early on too.<br /><br />  All in all, keep this on your rental list for when you've run out of all the better and even lesser choices you've got. I'm sure that list is ever-expnading.</p></body></html>

ET himself is a creative marvel, the cutest, most non-threatening alien in sci-fi history. The child actors are uniformly good, particularly Thomas and the beguiling Barrymore. "ET" ingeniously turns science-fiction conventions on their head, as the earthling grown-ups are the bad guys, and the alien, the hero. Larger-than life emotion (and tension) elevate this film to timeless family classic, aided by another majestic John Williams score.</p></body></html>

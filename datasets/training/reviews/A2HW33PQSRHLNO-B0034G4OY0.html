<meta name="summary" content="An unflinching look at mortality coupled with hope"></head><body><p>While one can't help but be surprised--even now--that Clint Eastwood had anything to do with this particular film (Harry Callahan is most definitely a thing of the past), he does an excellent job teaming up with Peter Morgan for this pleasant oddity which manages to transform Bahhhstan actor Matt Damon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305216088">Good Will Hunting (Miramax Collector's Series)</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000M341QE">The Departed (Widescreen Edition)</a> into a reclusive psychic (a real one) and a lover of Charles Dickens.<br /><br />Damon's character George Lonegan, a man who works on the docks of a shipping yard while possessing the ability to contact the dead, is a strange guy who no longer wants anything to do with the John Edwards' or Uri Gellers' of the world.  Once a professional psychic making tons of money, he now wants only to live a quiet life apart from the hereafter and in the now. The problem is that every time he touches someone, their past is revealed in a kind of watery cinematography that Eastwood clearly favors over the stereotypical "flashback telepathic vision" scenario.<br /><br />His brother Billy (Jay Mohr) is a man who rightly or wrongly feels differently and wants George to return to the I See Dead People Business.  Not only, he reasons, might this garner some cash--his brother is the real deal and in one of the most affecting scenes in the film, Lonegan gives a private reading to his a co-worker of his brothers' coming directly from his deceased wife.<br /><br />Cecile De France plays Marie LeLay, a famous French newscaster who is happy, famous, beautiful and all until she has a sudden vision of a tsunami while on vacation with her agent.  What exactly she sees may be open to the interpretation of the viewer: her own death?  The apocalypse?<br /><br />Because of two chance encouters--what makes this film touching and believable is that it adds an all too human dimension to the otherworldly subject by portraying quite worldly concerns, perhaps the most memorable of which concerns two small London boys with a heroin addicted mother--LeLay and Lonegan are brought together.  What happens at the end is certainly left open to the viewer's interpretation, though something big is definitely about to occur both in the metaphysical and worldly sense for the two protagonists.<br /><br />This is a film which stands on it's own merits stylistically but also delivers a message that needs to be sent: that those who quest for the afterlife, for the ultimate, are not to be laughed or sneered at.  Have we come so far that we can no longer believe in anything but the material world?  Why, then, do we watch people running around on television with glow lights and EVP monitors?  A brilliant movie and a must see.</p></body></html>

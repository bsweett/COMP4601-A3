I have a habit of buying movies before viewiing them. Dvds can be purchased for the price of seeing one in theaters or a rental at the video store. On to the movie, story is pretty weak. I dont see how people enjoyed this been there, done that story that had alright speical effects. Overall, its a renter and not buyer.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Confusing film about the CIA and a life filled with righteous deception"></head><body><p>Directed by Robert DiNiro, this is the fictionalized story of the beginnings of the CIA.  Matt Damon is cast as Robert Wilson, a composite character who believed in America and closed his eyes to some of its abuses in the belief that he was doing the best he could for his country.  We see him first as a young man joining the Skull and Bones society at Yale, a secret society steeped in tradition which shaped the lives of many of America's leaders.  The CIA is a secret society too, and as the film progresses the audience sees how it shapes its members.  There's a code of right and wrong here, and Wilson makes choices about what he sees as "right".  He marries Angelina Jolie because she is pregnant, but her life is lonely and unfulfilled because he never loves her.  His relationship with his son as well as everyone else has a wide variety of strings attached.  And, in the, end, Robert Wilson learns the price of a life filled with righteous deception.<br /><br />Matt Damon's acting ability is flawless in this film.  He embodies his character completely.  The storyline however, is extremely confusing and I suspect it was by design.  The audience often does not know what is happening or why.  This soon grows tedious to watch however, especially as the film is more than three hours long and it is impossible to be sure of who the bad guys and the good guys are.  As a result, I was bored a lot and even though this is clearly a worthwhile film, there are lots of problems with the fuzzy plot.<br /><br />For many, the appeal of excellent acting and a critique of the CIA's role in America since the 1960s will result in a satisfying film experience.  It wasn't quite enough for me however.</p></body></html>

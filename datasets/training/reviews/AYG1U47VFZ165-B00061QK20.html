<meta name="summary" content="Vivid Cinematic Poetry"></head><body><p>If CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON is a good book brought to the screen, then HERO is stunning poetry splashed across the silver screen in vivid colors, artful battles, and wonderful drama.<br /><br />During China's warring states period, the country was divided into seven kingdoms: Qin, Zhao, Han, Wei, Yan, Chu and Qi, and these kingdoms fought violently for years.  Understandably, thousands of people died ... and it is this very situation that serves as the narrative backbone for HERO.  The King of Qin seeks to unite all of China, and this desire made him the target of assassins.  In order to maintain his position, the king offered rewards (mostly the privilege to sit closer and closer to him) to anyone who could kill those opposed to him, and a nameless warrior (enter Jet Li) finally delivers the king the satisfaction he has long sought -- seeing the best assassins hunting for his head brought to their own end.<br /><br />Or has he?<br /><br />HERO is the kind of film that either one loves or one hates.  It polarizes audiences, presenting the story in a visual fashion that will either fascinate or dull the viewer.  For those it captures, HERO is an epic, possibly unrivaled in cinematic scope.  It needs to be seen to be loved or hated, and it needs to be seen, if for no other reason, for one to truly understand what the role of a 'hero' could quite possibly be.</p></body></html>

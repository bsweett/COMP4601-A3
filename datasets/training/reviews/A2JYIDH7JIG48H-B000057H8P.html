The plot is about entertainers endeavoring to produce a musical comedy based on Faust.  Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray provide a little comedy relief, but only the musical numbers stand out.  That's Entertainment is the most memorable.  Astaire has some fine dance sequences as always, and is good paired with Cyd Charrise in one scene and Jack Buchanan in another.  Astaire, Buchanan, and Fabray also do a cute number as baby triplets.  For the song & dance, it's worth viewing once or twice, but not over and over.</p></body></html>

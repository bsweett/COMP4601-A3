<meta name="summary" content="Salt"></head><body><p>For all it's flaws I found `Salt' to be a reasonably entertaining film.<br /><br />Following a CIA agent who is accused of being a Russian sleeper agent who then goes on the run, we see Jolie shoot and fight her way out of numerous scrapes.<br /><br />This is one of those films you need to suspend your disbelief to fully enjoy as it has so many inaccuracies and far fetched aspects that you could very quickly wind yourself up by pointing them all out.  If you manage to do this you should be able to enjoy this for what it is; a fast paced, espionage action film where you don't need to think to hard to enjoy it.  You can guess the various twists and plot revelations very early on, but it doesn't stop them being enjoyable when they are revealed.<br /><br />Jolie is very bland in this film, as are all the actors really and Li ev Shreiber is probably the best actor on offer.  The direction is ok, nothing special and the stunts are adequate enough.<br /><br />All in all this is a perfectly serviceable spy action film and like I mentioned at the start, for all it's flaws (which are numerous) it does still manage to entertain, which is about all we can hope for.  Worth a viewing, just don't expect anything outstanding.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></body></html>

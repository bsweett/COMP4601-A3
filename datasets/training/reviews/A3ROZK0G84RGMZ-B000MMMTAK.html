The wrestling scene was a bit gross but at the same time really funny.  I loved how he literally tries to bag Pamela Anderson.  I can't believe all those people got tricked so easily into believing he was actually from another country?  The funniest thing to me is how he was able to get some Americans to basically confess on how they felt about racism.  Great.</p></body></html>

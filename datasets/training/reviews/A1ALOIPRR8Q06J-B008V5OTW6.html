Are they just not like us, which is to say morally inferior? Study of history is crucial to understanding these questions. Ever hear about what happened at Deir Yassin on April 9, 1948? Or at Kafar Qasem on October 29, 1956. How much do we know about the founding of the Israeli state and what that meant for those non-Jews living in what was then the country of Palestine?<br /><br />Steven Spielberg is incapable of making a truly bad movie. He's one of<br />America's most entertaining and talented popular directors. Maybe the most popular. Spielberg movies are good Hollywood stuff. So, I very much enjoyed MUNICH as a suspenseful political/espionage action thriller. But truly useful in understanding history? Nah. Enjoy it as a well crafted Spielberg movie.<br /><br />If your an American you either A) passionately feel this film is unfair or even biased against Israel, or B) that it offers a challenging exploration of moral complexity and so on. You know shows "both sides". My sympathies much more with the latter, however I disagree with both. My guess would be that really only in America could there be such perceptions.<br /><br />The first part of the film portrays the events which took place in Munich during the 1972 Olympic Games. It is an amazing bit of filmmaking, making you witness to the tragedy. The second part of the film portrays the Israel response and it is largely fictious as director of the film Spielberg says so himself but some of the killings were depicted accurately.<br /><br />We get to know the head Jewish assassin, "Avner", played by the likable, intelligent and handsome Eric Bana. We meet his beautiful and see them together. We meet his mother who is quite an interesting character, but I'll not get into why...(I suspect Spielberg may have been saying something with this character, but who knows). We see the tragic terrorist attack in Munich and rightly are disturbed by this. We watch the top officials of the Israeli government decide on the proper response and we meet Golda Meir who is sort of Big Grandma of Israel.  Anway, it is clear that Israel must assassinate the terorists. No point in capturing any? Guess not.It is historically true is the Israeli government did murder those suspected have involvement along with some that may not have been and of course innocent civilians that were in the wrong place at the wrong time. But the mission was called "Operation Wrath of God" and so what does international law matter.<br /><br />Spielberg said he did not want to do a Charles Bronson DEATH WISH revenge flick. So, we see conflcit in our hero Avner and we do meet a terrorist A-Rab. The Palestinian is allowed to speak of the Olive Trees and land of his people before being blown away. MUNICH does NOT show, doesn't dare show and nor does any character speak of what motivated the terrorist Muslims. In MUNICH we can admit they are human and it seems to be admited there is such a thing as a Palestinian -and for this along an adminition that things in the real world aren't always black and white Spielberg incured the wrath of, if not of God Himself, at least his spokespersons on Earth in the form of certain groups and individuals I'll not bother mentioning because quite frankly they're best left ignored as much as possible. If your American you'd do well to read what you can from the Israeli press which on the whole covers the business of that country much, much better and has a wider variety of view points than anything you can get from the mainstream media in the US.</p></body></html>

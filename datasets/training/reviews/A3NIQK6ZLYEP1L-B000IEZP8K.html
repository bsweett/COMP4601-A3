<meta name="summary" content="Two good films and one so-so"></head><body><p>The first two movies are very good, in the old fashion Hollywood adventure way that many directors and writers seem to be going for.  The first two DVDs have tons of extras and great commentaries.  The third movie, The Scorpion King, feels more like a corny fantasy film, like the Gor flicks or a porn movie with all the sex removed.  They have tons of extras also but the commentaries are kind of weak.  If you don't have any of the movies I would suggest getting the set.  If you already have the first two DVDs don't bother with this set.  The first two DVDs, as the other reviewers have pointed out, are the same as those released before and I don't think the third DVD is worth getting.  Unless you can get it at a low price.  The third movie, in fact, is why the set has had two points removed.  Overall, there are lots of sexy women and humor, but the third movie just falls flat on its face, even with the charming Rock starring in it.</p></body></html>

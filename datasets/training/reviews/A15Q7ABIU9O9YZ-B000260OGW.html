<meta name="summary" content="Don't waste trust from a man like Charley on a card game"></head><body><p>The high points of this excellent film are simultaneously the stillness and simplicity of the Montana-like (Western Canada) background with again, the simplicity and strength of the dialogue. The two men, Costner as a Shane like character, traumatized by his past-trying to go 'straight' and Duvall, scarred also by a past who finds &quot;getting lost&quot; in the bigness of the late 19th century country comforting, work together like few actors can and do. Wryness, not one liners. Advice not mandates. A simple code of freedom and justice spoken in a cafe by Duvall, not Costner. <p>Costner, content to play second role to Duvall's experience in the role, and quite possibly in his skill as an actor.<p>Duvall is as good as he's ever been and Costner better than he's been in years.<p>Simple plot, right and wrong colliding a 100 years ago a 1000 miles from here. The love interest is a stabilizing factor, adding credence to what good men need, drawing out a painfully shy Charley (Costner) and the curmudgeon Boss (Duvall).<p>The best western in years, on par with The Unforgiven and Tombstone, perhaps better. 5 stars.

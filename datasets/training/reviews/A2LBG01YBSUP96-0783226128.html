<meta name="summary" content="gratuitous use of everything foul,to my delight!"></head><body><p>there was even a touch of incest!no doubt about it,90% of rappers today owe this movie their identities.this movie inspires their tough guy stories/personnas.as for the movie itself,well,im sure those reading this review have already witnessed the carnage that is scarface.cuban immigrant comes to USA and becomes major drug/crime kingpin of epic and brutal proportions.there are whispers that there are scenes here not on the original release.but if there are,theyre not in cronological order.they are in pain in the rear deleted scenes section.all this time and producers cant blend in deleted scenes?is the technology evading them?its not thrilling,for me at least,to view a scene unto itself.joyride had the best idea(others may have also,but im not sure).the deleted scenes are built into the actual ongoing movie.you will be prompted to click on an icon to experience deleted scene/s.why cant all of the ''special/ultimate/anniversary/yada yada blah''follow this simple example?joyride was not special effects driven yet it out does 99% of the new versions of previously released movies.ADD INTO THE MOVIE THE DELETED SCENES WILLYA?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?in my T2 ULTIMATE version review,i ranted about how''unwise''consumers could be by buying the same movie twice/thrice.no one will acknowledge the common sense behind such rant,hence,the flood of reissues.and reissues to the reissue.heck,if i could sell the brooklyn bridge,i would.and someone here would buy it.anyway,if youre into watching isolated scenes/buying the same movie again,have at it.on another note,i just bought weird science,3 oclock high and am about to get last exit in brooklyn.my list of great movies not on DVD is dwindling.year of the dragon,prison,8 million ways to die,and after hours are still waiting.</p></body></html>

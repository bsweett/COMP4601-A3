<meta name="summary" content="A discombobulated family comes together"></head><body><p>A fine cast helped garner the critical acclaim that the feel good comedic drama, "Little Miss Sunshine" richly deserved.  A dysfunctional family headed by unsuccessful motivational speaker Richard Hoover played by Greg Kinnear and his wife Sheryl played by Toni Collette embark on a 800 mile journey in a VW bus to a childrens beauty contest their daughter Olive played by the irresistable Abigail Breslin is a late entrant.  Olive had been choreographed and nurtured by her vulgar, heroin snorting grandfather played by Oscar winning Alan Arkin.  Also along for the ride were her gay and suicidal Proust professor uncle played nicely by Steve Carrell and brother Dwayne who'd taken a vow of silence played by Paul Dano.<br /><br />The Hoovers encounter a staggering array of obstacles that are capable of derailing the plans for their odyssey.  Family members become confronted with the decimation of their own personal aspirations during the trip.  They nonetheless pull together to assure that young Olive is able to fufill her destiny, the ability to compete in the Little Miss Sunshine contest.<br /><br />Directors Faris and Dayton brilliantly capture the inane but heartfelt interactions between family members as the acting ensemble portray a discordant group that rally together in a display of solidarity.</p></body></html>

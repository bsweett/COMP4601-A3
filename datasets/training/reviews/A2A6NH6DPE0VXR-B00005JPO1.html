A 4th film was rumored since 1997 but they couldn't agree on a script they liked. If this was the best script of them all, then I'm scared on how bad the others were. But still there's a lot less to whine about than there was with episode 1. This movie is never dull like that was. It's goofy and cartoonish though. But I didn't have a problem with that since the others have had their share of unbelieveable moments. Like Indy using a raft as a parachute and landing on to a river of all places in Temple of Doom for instance.<br /><br />  The action alone really isn't the only goofy thing about this one though. Cate Blanchett is an excellent actress but I stopped taking her villain Russian character seriously after she tries to read Indy's mind with the palm of her hand. Shia LaBeof befriending monkeys the second he sees them and swinging on vines with them wasn't needed as well. But still, people shouldn't whine so much. I'm just happy to finally see Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones again. I mean all the reviews here that say stuff like Spielberg and Lucas let me down again just make me wanna puke. I mean when Lucas is coming up with the story you should know that you shouldn't be too excited any more. The Star Wars Prequels are examples of that. His imagination has gone to a galaxy far far away.<br /><br />  The movie still managed to make me feel like a kid again though. No matter how goofy the action got I was still entertained. Ford is at least in good form as Indiana despite his age. He also has some fine chemestry with Shia LaBeouf (Transformers). They almost make as good of a team as Ford did with Sean Connery. It's also nice to finally see Karen Allen's character reintroduced as well. While Ray Winstone (The Departed) and John Hurt (Hellboy) are fun in supporting roles. The movie wasn't perfect like I said but I still left with a smile and so should other fans. They should just be happy that the movie was finally made and it could have been worse. Like, Indy could've had a new sidekick called Jar-Jar Binks for instance.</p></body></html>

He's trying to swing a book deal, or turn his so-far one-man show into something spectacular. We are never told what he left behind to pursue his "dream", but that's really not important.<br /><br />Frank, the mother's brother, (Steve Carell) is the country's preeminent Proust scholar who recently tried to kill himself for a number of reasons, all entertainingly told over dinner. He's gay, as is the 2nd (according to him) most prominent Proust scholar.<br /><br />Kinnear's father, known only as Grandpa (Alan Arkin) is a foul mouthed heroin user who was kicked out of an assisted living home. We soon learn why - other than the heroin use - when giving advice to his grandson about having as much sex as he possibly can while he's young and it's still legal to have sex with teenage girls. There's a screw or two loose there.<br /><br />The son, Dwayne (Paul Dano) is a fanatical devotee of Nietzsche and has taken a vow of silence until he joins the air force and flies a plane. He communicates through writing on a pad, and claims to hate everyone. He wears, at one point, a T-shirt that says "Jesus was Wrong". Hysterical.<br /><br />The daughter, Olive (Abigail Breslin), an adorable young girl has fantasies of winning the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant. Unfortunately, she's only adorable - and adorable isn't beauty pageant material. Still, this is her dream, and her family supports her enough to throw themselves in their VW van and drive hundreds of miles to get her into the pageant.<br /><br />The mother, Sheryl (Toni Collete) is the necessary straight character, and certainly the sanest of the bunch. Her presence holds everyone together.<br /><br />With a cast of characters like this, it's impossible for a fantastic voyage not to occur. And it does. From the van breaking down so that it can only be started by everyone getting out and pushing to an improbable hospital escape, the adventure is a lively one.<br /><br />The beauty pageant itself is extremely disturbing. I've never felt comfortable watching 8 year old girls preen about as adult women. To my sensibilities, it's the parent living vicariously through the daughter - most of the time, at least. I'm sure - like Olive - that some have dreams of their own. For those that don't, shame on the parent.<br /><br />Olive stands out, nearly literally, as a very sore thumb at the pageant. She does not have the makeup, the hair, the moves, or the skinny body to compete. That doesn't stop us from rooting for her. We have to, because she's easily the most endearing character in the film. We also feel tremendous pity for her, knowing that she just doesn't measure up to these other girls. Which, in itself, is sad. It's very likely that she more than measures up to them in terms of quality.<br /><br />Olive's dance presentation, the final of the evening, is hysterical. She begins to dance - a dance her grandfather taught her - and from the very first move, the audience is in hysterics. Throughout her entire performance, most couldn't stop laughing. Her family joined her on stage toward the end, which wasn't terribly believable, but served to demonstrate their intense loyalty to Olive and her dreams.<br /><br />The movie is centered on dreams. Richard dreams of becoming a motivational speaker; Dwayne dreams of becoming a pilot; Olive dreams of winning beauty pageants; Frank dreams of regaining his status as the preeminent Proust scholar; and Sheryl dreams of normalcy.<br /><br />Part of the enjoyment - aside from the hilarity - is watching the development of these dreams.</p></body></html>

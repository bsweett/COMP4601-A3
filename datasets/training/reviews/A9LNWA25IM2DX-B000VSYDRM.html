<meta name="summary" content="Almost like reading the book"></head><body><p>Director Tom Tykwer decided to take on a project many directors previously rejected for considering it `unfilmable', with `Run Lola run' as a reference he started to work on this project. The result? An excellent adaptation that makes the experience of watching this film feel almost like reading the book.<br /><br />Based on the novel by Patrick Suskind, `Perfume' tells the story of a singular character born with an enhanced sense of smell that enables him to identify and separate all smells he can detect. The character seems also to be cursed as everyone related to him ends up badly. When he gets obsessed with the smell of a virgin he then looks to learn how to capture the essence of things so he can obtain the smells he wants to create the ultimate perfume.<br /><br />The story in the movie is guided by a narrator (John Hurt) and has most of the story arcs from the novel; some details were removed but they aren't really to be missed, in the novel for example, Grenouille creates a perfume with the smell of human that is not shown in the film. From beginning to end the adaptation is incredibly accurate, but even though the ending is exactly the same as the one in the book (even the same lines), the ending didn't feel quite well to me in the movie, I remember it having a deeper effect on me when I read it.<br /><br />The style Tykwer uses to show the smell of things in interesting and in the same format of effects used in `Run Lola run', the music fits well with the movie as it uses haunting themes that complement the visuals to create a dark mood for the film.<br /><br />Other than a 30 minutes documentary of the making of the film, there are no special features. The movie is presented in anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 and 2.0 surround and English/French/Spanish subtitles. The lack of extras really don't compensate for the price, you can get the movie for a cheaper price in the amazon market place instead. This detail explains the star I took from the review.<br /><br />If you read the novel you definitely want to see the film as the people involved in the making made a great job adapting it to the cinema. If you haven't you don't really need to read the novel first unless you'd like to compare details.</p></body></html>

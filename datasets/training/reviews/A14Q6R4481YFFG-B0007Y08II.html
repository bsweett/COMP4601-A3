This film certainly conveys that sentiment perfectly.  On the one hand, you've got crazed Americans in red-white-and-blue jets destroying various world landmarks while chasing Osama bin laden look-alikes; on the other hand, the sneering directed at Hollywood and liberals in general ("...and they act all corporation-y...") is far more visceral and emphasized.  Recommended to anyone on the right, and if you're on the left, you'd probably better skip this one.<br /><br />James Taranto remarked on opinionjournal a few weeks ago that "Team America" is the only even partially pro-Global War on Terror movie made.  That got me thinking.  *I* certainly can't think of another one, but I can think of several anti-GWOT films ("e.g., "Valley of the Wolf") with a slough more of them right around the corner (e.g., "Redacted").  I feel bad that the only pro-GWOT film is constituted by puppets, but I guess that's about as much as we can expect out of Hollywood.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Finally, Indiana Jones without TV or VHS!"></head><body><p>Finally, the Indian Jones Trilogy has made it to DVD.  And it was worth the wait!  With amazing picture quality, superb sound, and a few nice touch-ups thrown in throughout the series (one notable example being the snake/glass scene in "Raiders") this DVD set is definitely worth its meager price.  All of the special features are contained on a fourth DVD with three extensive "Making of..." documentaries on each film.  Additionally, a few short featurettes are included on various aspects of the technical crew, from stunts to sound.  The documentaries are very interesting to watch for anyone who loves the films.  One learns all sorts of interesting facts and trivia and gets to watch footage from the filming sessions.  It's nice to see how the idea started small and developed into a gigantic success.<p>That being said, it's disappointing that there aren't more special features to be had in this set.  I would have liked to have seen Director's commentaries on each film and deleted scenes.  This set definitely does not have some of the extra features that other sets include, but the documentaries make up for this fact to a certain extent.  <p>All in all, what's really worth the price of this set are the restored films.  Having seen these movies only on VHS and TV myself, it was stunning to see them without any defects or tracking lines.  And the sound blew me out of my seat.  One can really gain an appreciation for the sound effects editing and the score with this release.  At a price of just $15 a film (plus the extra DVD with the documentaries), this set is definitely worth the investment and should be in everyone's collection.</p></body></html>

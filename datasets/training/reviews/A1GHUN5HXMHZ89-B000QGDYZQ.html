Yes Sandra Bullock is a decent actress. Yes it is an interesting story idea. But somewhere along the line it gets boring and by the end of the movie when we realize nothing can be done you feel as though you wasted your time. My wife and I both agreed we wouldn't watch this again. It didn't make us feel better, uplifted, or entertained. It is a argument for fate, nothing more. So if you want to be depressed by the whole movie being spent with a wife trying to save her husband but can't by all means have fun. Oh and making her pregnant after she makes up with him does not make a happy ending in my book. He's dead Jim, as is this movie. I do not recommend this movie in any shape or form. I guarantee if you see it you will wonder why you wasted the time. The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is I have actually seen worse movies and this had decent acting and production values.</p></body></html>

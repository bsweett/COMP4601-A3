<meta name="summary" content="Even More Breathtaking Than Remembered"></head><body><p>A few evenings ago, I had the great pleasure of introducing my four year old daughter to Walt Disney's SNOW WHITE.  Let me tell you, SNOW WHITE is still a true classic - beautiful, charming, and quite amazing even all these years later.  And the joy of sharing it with my wee one made it even more special.<br /><br />I don't think that I have seen SNOW WHITE in probably close to 40 years.  While I remember the basic story - who doesn't? - there are many snippets and scenes that I had forgotten.  Watching this latest, lovely version with my daughter snuggled in my lap, the forgotten scenes and songs came flooding back, and my daughter and I found ourselves singing along together.  The music of SNOW WHITE clearly crosses the generations with ease.  Old favorites, such "Some Day My Prince Will Come" and "Heigh Ho," sail across the years and are as fun and memorable as ever.  My little princess was entranced by this film, and, I have to admit, so was I.<br /><br />It is astonishing to realize that SNOW WHITE was released in 1937, and that it was Disney's first full length animated feature film.  The story, the art, the animation, and the music have all stood the test of time, and still rank near the top with the best of the Disney films.  This latest version is bright and sharp; quite simply, it is exquisite.<br /><br />Everyone born after 1937 was basically raised on SNOW WHITE.  I am so glad that Disney has rereleased it for yet another generation.  I can just picture great-grandmothers, grandmothers, mothers, aunts, daughters, and sisters all sitting down together to watch this movie, introducing it to the latest little princess in the family.  And that, most certainly, is the true definition of a classic family film.</p></body></html>

So I had high hopes for this movie, but they were not fulfilled. The production is pretty good, and the film's basic message is OK -- but the high-speed action sequences aren't even remotely believable, as Will Smith fends off computer-generated robot armies time and again.  Not really a bad movie, but it could have been so much better!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Underworld: Evoultion bites the dust"></head><body><p>Sequel to the 2003 Underworld starts off where it left off as that leather clad lethal vampire Selene, played by Kate Beckinsale (Pearl Harbor, The Aviator) and her vampire/lycan hybrid Michael, played by Scott Speedman (Dark Blue, My Life Without Me) are on the run. Soon after vampire Markus, played by Tony Curran (Blade 2, The 13th Warrior), rises from his tomb and on the hunt for Selene and Michael because she killed Victor, played by Bill Nighy (Love Actually, The Constant Gardener). Also Markus is looking to find his brother William who is like the lycan of all lycans because Markus is like the vampire of all vampires...one of the very first...oh yippie! Really not. As much as I like vampire stories this one doesnt cut it. Beckinsale is rendered dull and her husband, Director Len Wiseman gets her naked...wow what a love scene that was....corny I should say. The Lycans are still looking pretty ridiculous like the first one and as much as I love blood and violence and action....this was terrible..Markus gets killed by swirling helicopter blades...wow..impressive. Bad dialouge and plot thin...man, what a waste. Also starring Steven Mackintosh (Blue Juice, The Jacket), Michael Sheen (Timeline, Bright Young Things), Derek Jacobi (Gladiator, Gosford Park) and Shane Brolly (Sin's Kitchen, Imposter). It left open for a third one....WHY?! They are serious running out of ideas for movies that's why they make sequels like this, Big Momma's House 2 and Final Destination 3..oh well....peace out</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Moose Hole - Goes Off Nearly Without a 'Hitch'"></head><body><p>It appears as though you only need one surprise-hit film, one more notably found during a time period at the box office that has been particularly dead-silent for movie studios in years past, in order to make a name for yourself in Hollywood, or at least in the romance genre of the film industry. After bursting out of the gate big time in September 2002 with Sweet Home Alabama, the Reese Witherspoon romantic comedy which went on to gross close to one-hundred and thirty million dollars domestically, Andy Tennant, whose directorial credentials have been severely limited to a small number of lackluster features such as Ever After and Anna & the King, now helms marquee name Will Smith in a more ambitious, and therefore more highly-anticipated, film but the question still remains as to whether he truly has what it takes inside to deliver the hit film the studio needs whenever they demand it of him.<br /><br />The story centers on the man who thought he knew everything there is to know about getting a man to sweep the love of his life off her feet and how it had it all wrong when a cynical woman walks into his life. Alex Hitchens, also known as Hitch, has been declared the date doctor amongst his clientele within New York City by helping the desperate men who contact him to land the love of their lives. His philosophy of relationships is actually quite simple - any man can sweep any woman off her feet; he just needs the right broom. His next client is a bank accountant named Albert, who is about as clumsy and downright pathetic as a person of his age can get but still maintains a quality that makes him admirable. While he helps Albert attempt to pull off what seems like the impossible, Alex falls head over heels for a beautiful woman named Sara, a gossip columnist with a cynical view on both men, which is that they are only out for the next woman to land in bed with, and life in general. Sadly, in spite of his extensive list of past cliental success thanks to his techniques, this time around he can not seem to get his practices right around her and yet she still remains attracted to him despite this. The story for Hitch follows in the hollow footsteps of every other romantic-comedy feature that has come before its time, adhering to the same basic blueprint storyline and committing the exact sins and vices as has been accustomed for audiences, boyfriends at least, but in turn does so with such convincing style and flare that it does not become a hindrance at all. Andy Tennant, the director who also helmed the Reese Witherspoon surprise-hit, Sweet Home Alabama, has clearly acquired a knack of sorts for this particular genre, or maybe it actually is more along the lines of hand-picking the right actors, or actresses, in the lead roles that allows these films to connect with audiences so readily. In any event, Hitch's meritable message that in spite of our best intentions there are no magic formulas, potions, or specific game plans to tie down the love of our lives, if we are even aware of it at the time we meet them, and we have only to be ourselves to find acceptance makes the whole two-hours effort worth the price of admission, especially on a Valentine's Day weekend.<br /><br />Will Smith is positively charming, witty, and, must it be said, stylish in the role of Alex Hitchens, also known as the date doctor. The romantic-comedy genre, or comedies in general, is the precise arena in which Smith should use to his benefit his charming comedic stick as opposed to dramas of a semi-seriousness nature, I Robot being a prominent example, where it tends to throw off the flow of the storyline for its audience. Sure, there are some questions left unanswered as to how Hitch went from being a geeky lovelorn loser as he was back in college to the classy professional he is today, but its audience automatically accepts the notion that it just happened. It is after all a romantic comedy, is it not? Would you truly come to expect clear and precise logic or reason from this genre? On the other hand though, unlike films of this specific genre, there appears quite an equal balance in the amount of screen time, if not the quality of their particular scenes together or separate, between Will Smith's Alex Hitchens and Eva Mendes' Sara, of which she performs adequately well. There may be a time in the not too distant future that she could stray away from the usual eye-candy or limited comedic roles she has been reduced to over the last few years but as it works for her at the moment there are truly no complaints with her performance. As had been abundantly clear in the film's trailer leading up to its release, Kevin James, star of the CBS prime-time television series King of Queens, undoubtedly steals the spotlight, if only for a short period of time, from his fellow co-stars in Hitch, which for once is actually a fantastic quality to have seeing as how this is first major film role. Every single scene he makes an appearance in goes practically without a single misstep, or at least nothing that was noteworthy that is. Now if only lead roles, of which he will receive in the not too distant future, will be as easily accomplished as this.<br /><br />Overall, Hitch more then states the obvious in its observations about relationships, which is bluntly that men are bumbling idiots when it comes to love and women are nearly as clueless as they are (though certainly less commonly or explicitly), which certainly not advance within the field of love if that is what you were hoping for. But, on the more optimistic side of things, this film does conveniently provide with an opportunity to take that special someone out to catch a charming, if not often clich&eacute; filled, romantic comedy. Here is yet another example of a high-profile feature in which a fair majority of the gags found within this two-hour film are visibly present, either entirely or partially, in its trailer. The surprising quality of Hitch, as opposed to so many other projects that have fallen flat on their face in part to this horrendous marketing move, is that when these elements are placed within the proper contexts of the script they become more humorous then they had been beforehand. This helps separate this picture from the rest of the drawn-out romantic comedy pack that has plagued movie theaters the past few years. A small problem the film tends to run into occasionally, only when either the direction or the script calls for it to be this way, is that the dialogue and the actions of the characters onscreen become overtly, border-line excruciatingly, clich&eacute;d. But, when you think about seriously, is this not the curse of every romantic comedy churned out by Hollywood within the past decade, if not longer? Another fate of chick-flicks' past that this film has managed successfully to avoid is the bubble-gum pop laden soundtrack, which, though rarely addictive, happens to have worn out its inventiveness. Bottom-line, Hitch gets its point across though in the fact that through our lives we will have the fortunate opportunity to meet a wide-range of astonishing individuals who click instantly with us, many of whom we will be forced to lose at some point or another. But unless we are willing to take the risk involved and face rejection and heartache on occasion, we will never know for sure and that will be a fate worse then anything else life can throw at you. As the date-doctor himself so eloquently put it, any man can truly sweep any woman off her feet; he just needs the right broom to do it, which is whatever you want to make of it in your life.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The second best western ever made"></head><body><p>Ethan Edwards, an ex confederate is to his own way, an outlaw. But I'd really like to make a crossroad in the analysis. Doesn't Ethan belong to the dinasty of the mytical hero? In the purest sense of the term. His origin is not very clear. And suddenly he appears, so he leaves at the end. In this sense his efforts for searching his kidnapped niece are an epic fight against all the obstacles.<br />And the turning point that makes that film so extraordinary, is the decission which prevails when he finally finds Debby and almost kills her. In this sense it's a personal choice. Through all his trip he has established his own code. He kills Putterman because it has to be done, and forget all the ethical reasons.<br />But when he goes to rescue her with the group, and finally saves her, you notice he isn't very satissfied with the result.<br />At last, all the people experiences a happy ending, but he doesn't seem to be very convinced with himself. And that's why he made a decision politically right.<br />John Ford was the western's director per excellence. The  film has unforgettable moments, the use of the objective, the travellings and the fantastic landscape in Texas support this jewel. If not for The wild bunch this film would be the greatest western movie, but a second place is not a trageddy.<br />In addition you can find in Ethan a close affinity with the beliefs of Pike in the wild bunch. Doesn't it tell you anything?<br />You must have this DVD in your collection. It's a must. Believe me.</p></body></html>

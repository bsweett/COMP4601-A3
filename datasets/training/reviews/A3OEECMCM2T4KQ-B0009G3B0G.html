The head wound should have been fatal but he miraculously survives, after 12 months of convalescence, he is discharged, however experiences bouts of amnesia. Now we see him walking along a cold snowy road somewhere in the northeastern United States, stopping to help a mother and daughter experiencing car trouble. The woman is obviously a drunk, vomiting in the ditch beside the road while Jack attempts to fix their truck. The little girl, Jackie, and Jack make a connection, and she asks him if she can have his dog tags, which he gives her. He fixes the truck, the woman shouting obscenities and drunkenly drives away. Later, a man who seems to be normal, gives Jack a lift, when they're pulled over by the police. Something happens, the police officer is shot dead, Jack cannot remember what occurred, and he is later convicted of murder. He is judged to be criminally insane and sent to an institution. It is here that the film begins to get very strange.<br /><br />We now see Jack in his cell, given medication on a continual basis, and as time moves on, he seems to becoming more and more docile, when in the middle of the night, he is violently whisked away and taken to the basement, where he is injected with a drug, strapped in a tortuous-looking jacket to keep him from moving, and put in a morgue locker- draw designed for corpses, and left there screaming bloody murder. Anyone with the slightest bit of claustrophobia, would feel discomfort watching this scene. While trapped in the morgue locker, he begins to experience severe hallucinations, that are simply too real. Three hours later the attendants open the locker and return him to his cell.<br /><br />We discover that the head doctor, (Kris Kristofferson) is performing drastic experimental therapy on Jack, in an attempt to cure him of his criminally violent behaviour. The doctor is obviously a quack, other doctors have an idea what he is doing,(Jennifer Jason Leigh) but turn a blind eye. Through the course of this therapy, Jack's "hallucinations" reveal that he has travelled into the future and discovers the exact day of his death. Is he hallucinating from the therapy or has he actually travelled in time? The "flash forwards" are just too real, as he meets a grown-up Jacky, (Keira Knightley) and finds his dog tags in her house. It is at this stage that he behaves radically in the institution in order to continue the therapy because he wants to return to the future and find the answers to the mystery.<br /><br />This type of film can either be a complete failure or can be done in such a way that the filmmakers pull it off - the filmmakers, in this case, pulled it off, because it is a riveting film, well acted and well-written, keeping the audience enthralled from start to finish.<br /><br />Adrien Brody gives a believable performance, he is a subtle actor, bringing to the character the right amount of pathos without over doing it. In fact all of the performances are above average making the film credible and worthwhile viewing.</p></body></html>

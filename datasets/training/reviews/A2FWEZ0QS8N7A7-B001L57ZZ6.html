<meta name="summary" content="Boy, Have We Seen This Movie Before"></head><body><p>Lots of spoilers here, but then, isn't this movie just a pastiche of a hundred others?<br /><br />Billy Bob channels Tommy Lee after Harrison Ford. Shia a scruffier Matt. When computers go bad, but this time with a creepy female voice.  And don't forget, speaking of bad, The Patriot Act.  Hundreds of Chicago police cars in spectacular pileups. Drones destroy with incredible accuracy.  We're all being watched, we're all being monitored and it's all a seamless net of spying. Overachieving brother, slacker brother just waiting for his moment. And, of course, father finally recognizes slacker gold.<br /><br />How does it all end?  The usual way, cleaning the couch of popcorn kernels still in the grasp of a pleasant mindless buzz.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Don't Run Out And Get "Hitch""></head><body><p>On the surface the message of "Hitch" is you can't predict love. There are no rules, you just have to go out there and be yourself and if you do that you will find everyone has a special someone out there waiting to be found.<br /><br /> But I've seen this movie before and the most memorable example is the 1972 Herbert Ross film based on Woody Allen's stage play "Play It Again, Sam". In that movie Allen wants to be Humphrey Bogart, who is suppose to be the epitome of cool. Allen thinks if he can act more like somone else, and less like himself he will get the girl.<br /><br /> Fastforward, it's now 2005 and most people don't know who Humphrey Bogart is so they now look to Alex "Hitch" Hitchens (Will Smith) who is a "date doctor". He coaches men on how to be cool. He tells them all the rules of dating.<br /><br /> I wonder though if underneath the surface there is another message being sent out. Will Smith is an African-American actor who has a great amount of box-office success. Maybe he wasn't chosen for the part merely because of his appeal. In our society we tend to think the black culture is also the epitome of cool. Only black men can act suave and sweep the ladies off their feet. Only they know how to dress or dance whereas white men are seen as nerds. Notice how nearly all of Hitch's clients are white males. I realize I'm thinking outside the box here, but don't be so quick to dismiss the casting decisions made in this movie. I realize Hollywood at times seems as if it doesn't have a brain but just think about it the images you are seeing and what exactly they mean in relation to society.<br /><br /> But most people who watch this movie may not even think about it terms of its social ramification so lets talk about it as if it had no hidden agenda.<br /><br /> Alex Hitchens was not always the "date doctor" as a flashback shows us. In college he was quite unpopular until one day he fell in love with Cressida (Robinne Lee). He thought she was the love of his life and he made sure to repeatedly tell her he loves her to which she would appear uncomfortable. Alex then catches Cressida cheating on him, breaking his heart. He now vows he will never have another man go through what he did again. So he decides he will help men get the women of their dreams.<br /><br /> Albert (Kevin James) is an accountant who is in love with Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta), one of the clients his firm handles. She doesn't even know he exist and so he seeks out Hitch.<br /><br /> Hitch thinks Albert his hopeless but sticking true to his vow agrees to help him out anyway. Albert though does nothing but stumble over things and knock things over. But I just found it annoying. Sure Woody Allen has made a career out of it, but I've never heard, even from Allen's critics, somone describe what he does as predictable and juvenile. I can not say the same thing for Kevin James.<br /><br /> Now while Hitch is helping Albert get the girl of his dreams, Hitch meets a gossip columnist Sara (Eva Mendes). Sara is shown as a cold bitter person who has some issues, that sadly are never fully explored in this movie, and seems to have sworn off men. She claims they always disappoint her. We soon realize she was just waiting for Hitch to come along. But when Hitch is with her he doesn't seem to be playing his game right. He stumbles, says the wrong thing, and even gets food poisoning.<br /><br /> The movie then becomes a guessing game of whether or not Albert will get Allegra in the end? Will Allegra find out about Hitch? Will Hitch get Sara and will she ever find out about who he really is?<br /><br /> If you're over five who should be able to guess the answers to these questions and that's pretty much the problem with this movie. Everythng happens exactly the way it is suppose to happens. Nothing new or different is done here. It strickly follows the formula of movies before it. And I thought it was all done without any big laughs.<br /><br /> Now a movie like "Hitch" I guess is pretty hard to actually hate it. I didn't have a bad physical reaction to it but I don't think I would want to watch it again. It is not a great movie and quite frankly I'm surprised at the reaction this movie is getting on Amazon. But this movie is not worth your time.<br /><br /> Okay, so if by some small miricle I've convinced you not to see this movie you're asking yourself then what should I go out and see. Well in theaters there is Paul Haggis' "Crash", and if you like animation, and even if you don't, please, please, please go see "Howl's Moving Castle" and I also recommend "Cinderella Man" and the new "Star Wars" movie. On DVD you have Sean Penn giving one of his best performances in "The Assassination of Richard Nixon" and Kevin Bacon in "The Woodsman" and on a lighter note the Alain Renais French musical\comedy "Not on the Lips".<br /><br /> Bottom-line: Disappointing formula driven romantic\comedy that just isn't all that funny. Kevin James starts to get a bit annoying and the movie just bails on Eva Mendes as it leads us to think there is some secret about her past and a particular man that may have hurt her.</p></body></html>

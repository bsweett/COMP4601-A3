<meta name="summary" content="Eh, Not my Favorite"></head><body><p>I could take or leave this movie. To me it was not as good as Meet the Parents. While Barbra Stresiand and Dustin Hoffman played unique characters, the movie used them too heavily at the sacrifice of the story. Near the end I was growing weary of sexual humor and wanted the movie to end. It's not that I don't enjoy a good joke, but The Fockers tries too hard to be one big joke. The story is weak and virtually non-existant. I didn't find myself laughing much.</p></body></html>

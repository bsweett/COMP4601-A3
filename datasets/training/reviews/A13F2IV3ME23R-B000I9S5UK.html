<meta name="summary" content="GREAT CHARACTER LINE-UP --"></head><body><p>Not going into this movie with any pre-conceived ideas I was ready to enjoy some action and mystery.<br /><br />It sure delivered!  Hawke [like that name] as Jake lead us through a mental and emotional maze.  The two women were a bit confusing [or is it a distraction]<br /><br />To me Fishburne as Bishop was a disturbing but powerful character [was he trustworthy at all??] Hate to say it but was glad he got away.<br /><br />I expected those two escapees to get it -- Was that a SWAT team shooter or an Army sniper?<br /><br />But Dennehy was the biggest surprise -- great character! [the twit].<br /><br />Precinct 13 set in Detroit was debatible - yeah! where did the trees come from?  But still, don't bother with location just go with the flow.<br /><br />Still a great movie to watch - Hey, I am not buying the production just the enjoyment of watching some action and very good, believable characters.<br /><br />Definitely Recommended - action, great pace, some mystery [Gabriel Byrne was great - just as evil as ever] - Well worth watching again. [except for that fricking barnyard language]</p></body></html>

Night Shyamalan film was much better than his last, The Sixth Sense. First off I think the story is much better. It tells the tale of Bruce Willis' character who basically cannot be hurt, or can't get sick. I don't want to give any of the movie away, so I won't get into it in specifics. All I can say that I was on the edge of my seat in numerous scenes, with my heart just pounding away. There were some very creative angles in which some scenes were shot in the picture. An example of this would be the opening sequence on the train where Bruce is talking to another woman. Its like you are looking between the seats in the section in front of them watching the action. Little sutlties like that give this film a look of its own. An actor which impressed me was the young boy who plays Bruce Willis' son. I wish I knew his name, but I think he had a great performance. I had read some critics reviews and many had said they thought the ending was terrible. Well honestly, I don't know what they are smoking, but I thought it was shocking and unexpected, at least in my point of view. Definetly what I was hoping for in this movie, I'm surely going to see it again.</p></body></html>

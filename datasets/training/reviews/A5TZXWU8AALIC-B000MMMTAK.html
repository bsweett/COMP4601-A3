<meta name="summary" content="Gaspingly Funny"></head><body><p>I cannot remember the last time I laughed this hard and this much at a movie.  I might have to go all the way back to "Blazing Saddles," "Animal House," and "Airplane!"<br /><br />"Borat" is just that funny.<br /><br />There is so much that is so politcally incorrect, so outrageous...just so WRONG that I was gasping just before the biggest laughs.  The sold-out crowd I saw it with sounded like they would agree with me.<br /><br />Before you go, you have to know this: Borat isn't real.  He's one of three characters played by a brilliant British comedian named Sacha Baron Cohen, who's perfected each persona to appear totally believable.  His other two characters, the hopelessly white and moronic Ali G and the out-and-proud gay fashionista Bruno are absent here but Borat easily carries the show.  How Cohen doesn't break character in some situations is as much fun as watching the hapless people he's goofing on.<br /><br />The film has a loose feel to it but it contains a great eye for detail.  For example, pay attention to what's inside of Borat's producer's refrigerator when Borat catches up to him in L.A.<br /><br />I can't wait for the DVD to hopefully listen to a commentary from the filmmakers!<br /><br />Wildly, wildly funny.</p></body></html>

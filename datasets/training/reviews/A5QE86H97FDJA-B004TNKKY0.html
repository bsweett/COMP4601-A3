<meta name="summary" content="First film = good, 2nd = fair, 3rd = bad"></head><body><p>The first film was fun because of its' inventiveness but the second film was a wild brilliant ride but it was darker and disturbing. By the the third film, you were bored with the whole idea and it was just too silly to waste any time watching. Well, what the heck, watch them all in sequence but be sure your kids are older because the 2nd film is too upsetting for smaller kids.</p></body></html>

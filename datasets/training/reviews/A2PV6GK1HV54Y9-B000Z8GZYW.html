Hopefullly this hit film will put a smile on your face afterwords, Bill Murray and Andie MacDowell are heavenly together. They have great chemistry and you believe their love/hate relationship. This is director's Harold Ramis second best film after National Lampoon's Vacation, I just love his movies. I highly recommend purchasing this classic, enjoy!</p></body></html>

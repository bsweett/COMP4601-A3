<meta name="summary" content="Tough guy bites the dust"></head><body><p><p><br />This is a more-or-less run-of-the-mill tough guys film directed by the master of the genre, Martin Scorsese.  One thing sets it apart from the other gangbanger films: it is based on fact--the life of Henry Hill (played by Ray Liotta), a half Irish, half Sicilian punk from New York City who associated himself with the local mob at an early age.<p><p>From a run-of-the-mill street punk, Hill graduates into bigger scores, and eventually into dealing drugs.  To save his neck he turns government witness, through the Witness Protection program, and burns everyone who has ever known or been associated with him. The feds get him placed in Seattle with his wife and kids, but once a punk, always a punk.  He falls back into his old patterns, and his wife divorces him and he again gets entangled with the law.<p><p>All pretty predictable.<p><p>The big boys that he ratted on end up doing time, of course, and so everthing is made acceptable, except... Somehow, we end up with the feeling that justice has not really been done.  He should have been locked up as well.  At least, that's my reaction.<p><p>The film is of course well done.  But, I thought the filthy language was overdone and gratuitous.  I think a good film could be made, and still get the idea across, using language more acceptable to a general audience.  You wouldn't want to view this one in company with your mother (or any other person you respected.)  That's too bad.<p><p>We've come a long way since Gable cussed mildly in Gone With the Wind, and everyone gasped in dismay.  Are we better off now, that nothing is left unsaid anymore?<p><p>Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret)<br />author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<br />and other books<p></p></body></html>

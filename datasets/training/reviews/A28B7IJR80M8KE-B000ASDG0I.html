<meta name="summary" content="Way better than "True Lies""></head><body><p>Aside from "Troy", this is Brad Pitt at his best, him & Angelina Jolie have good chemistry, & are quite funny in this film, I was sure I was going to hate it, especially given all the tabloid hype surrounding it, but to my amazement, I laughed at these two trying to outmanuever each other, if you have ever been married, than this is fun to watch, it is definately every married couples fantasy as far as boredom might go, Pitt & Jolie play a married couple that are hired assasins for rival companies who discover each other after both are asssigned to the same hit, Pitts arrival in a doone buggie with 80's rock band "Poison" playing in the bcackground is comical at best, when they discover each other, they have what you could call a marital sqaubble that involves guns, as they litterally destroy their suburban house, is comical at best, the scene where Pitt gets in her moving car as she abandons it causing him to go off the road & down a hill as he says "we need to talk" is funny, all & all, a fun movie if you don't take it seriously, & Pitt, who it seems is now loosing up in movies, it is about time he got out of the serious genre of movies & let loose, & here he does just that, watch it, you won't be bored.</p></body></html>

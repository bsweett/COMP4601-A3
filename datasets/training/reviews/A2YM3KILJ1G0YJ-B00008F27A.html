Guess what?  AOD is not only probably a better movie in that singular genre, but it also includes all the other genres.  Imminently rewatchable, it's the perfection of an otherwise unsavory blend of King Arthur, Leslie Nielson, the combined might of a zombie and skeleton army, the special effects of Clash of the Titans, and a final showdown between good and evil that has paved the way for countless others since.  In fact, it could be argued that AOD has been the inspiration for more scripts, concepts, and subplots since its creation than is even worth mentioning.<br /><br />Aside from the aforementioned special effects - which are admittedly bad - the rest is perfection.  The homage to the Three Stooges, the trash-talking during sword fights, the hokey skeleton army storming the castle, all perfect.  Comedic timing that would make even a headliner jealous, there are numerous moments throughout the movie that illicit snorts.  Even the musical score, which blends seamlessly with the action as well as the romance, is nearly without equal.  A person going back in time several hundred years and immediately being the smartest, most powerful person is a hilarious concept because it's cemented in probability.  Not only smarter, but more than likely stronger, craftier, and better suited for an actual battle in nearly every way.  Which brings me to Bruce Campbell.<br /><br />He's absolutely untouchable as far as I'm concerned.  The fact that he doesn't placate the armor-wearing simpletons by changing his word selection, using slang that would obviously confuse and amaze all, is brilliant.  Every sword swing, shotgun blast, and taunting laugh is the epitome of entertainment.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie...WHAT is wrong with you?!  If you have, do yourself a favor; watch it again.  This is still one of the most enjoyable movies of all time.<br /><br />Jason Elin</p></body></html>

All the wait for this???"></head><body><p>I don't understand the hype surrounding Rob Zombie's much-awaited directorial debut, which becomes nothing more than a bloodier, gorier rehash of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"and not even a good one! While it does have dazzling visuals, gob smacking editing, flamboyant sets and deliciously over the top characters, that's the only merit I can give it. <p>Taking its cue from vintage 70s horror films, "House" centers on very little, but one might make out that it's about four kids whose car breaks down and they end up in a house full of lunatics. You see, the kids were on the road looking for eerie and abnormal tourist attractions and are about to stare a couple in the face, most notably the manic cannibalistic Dr Satan. <p>If an hour and a half of undecipherable plot and sickening - but not exactly novel - horror tickles your fancy, then "House of 1000 Corpses" should get your heart palpitating. Some of the characters in this movie are truly terrifying. Sid Haig's Captain Spaulding, the owner of a roadside attraction chronicling serial killers, is an obvious highlight. He's freakishly uncomforting, but refreshingly entertaining. It's a pity the movie didn't feature more of him in it's plot. Karen Black's over the top performance is also a highlight, but hey, she's a legend in my book. <p>Once the kids get to their `Final Destination'--the house of horrors, if you will--the film goes down hill. One by one the freaks come out of the woodwork, and one by the one the kids are slaughtered. Nothing very novel there - and horror fans, it isn't done very imaginative either. In fact, most of the horror sequences are clouded by either foggy edits, shots of old horror films or TV shows, or unfathomable imagery. For a film that's been shopped around to that many distributors and been removed and re-slotted into different release dates, I fail to see what the attraction is with this film. In my opinion, it's not better than an MTV video clip that some hard rocker would helm. Yes, it's similar to "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", but more "The Next Generation" than the original. Now does a film like that deserve so much of your attention?</p></body></html>

So.......10 am on Friday morning, I was sitting in the theater with my wife hoping not to be disappointed.......we were not! The film's opening scene gets your attention and then back pedals a few hours to fill in the blanks. This works very well and makes you want to know the who, what and where!  Robert Downey Jr. is perfectly cast as Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man or "ol' Shellhead"....if you will. I think his career is about to take a very big turn for the better after this film! I think he will forever be associated with this character like Toby McGuire is to Spider-Man. I can't see anyone else in either role now. Like the Spider-Man films, it's the characters who are the stars and that's what makes the FX and super hero stuff work so well. This is one of the best Superhero films since any of the Spider-Man films. I actually may go see this again, something I never do, well I did see the first Spider-Man movie twice. I don't know if anyone noticed this, but Tony Stark's cell phone ring was the theme song melody from the 1960's Iron Man cartoon,(totally cool)I love little things like this! 'Iron Man' takes the heart of the 'Spider-Man' films and the believable techincal aspects from 'Batman Begins' and comes up with one entertaining knock out of a movie!<br /><br />A compelling story, a great cast, superb special effects and most of all it's FUN! Like all superhero movies should be....go see this movie!..and stay through the credits for a great cameo setting up the next installment......oh yes, there will be another!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Epic Comic Book Film"></head><body><p>Watchmen is a film directed by aesthetically strong Zac Snyder (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q6GX5Y">300</a> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002ABURA">Dawn of the Dead</a> remake).  This film is as loyal a transfer as can possibly be imagined of the twelve issue <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401219268">comic book</a> masterpiece written by Alan Moore.  The Watchmen was a story tailor-made for the comic book medium, it isn't and never was intended to be made into a film, so I can at least partially sympathize with Moore's frustration in seeing this happen.  To be honest, I'm an even bigger fan of Moore's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1563898586">League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</a> series and I'm a bit surprised and perplexed to not hear he has the same animosity toward the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JM5B">film</a> version of his work there, especially when considering the tremendous difference in the quality of that movie compared to Snyder's work on the Watchmen.  The Watchmen is an evenly paced epic that is surely not for everyone.  It has its minor flaws but it is still an outstanding achievement.<br /><br />To briefly summarize, the film takes place at a time that would be Richard Nixon's fifth term in office.  It is literally a setting that considers what might happen if superheroes were actual and had a major impact on our reality.  For example, Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup), a naked blue omnipotent character, changes the results of our country's war in Vietnam.  A lot changes, so that is just one example.  Other characters include; the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), an elder Watchmen that has serious ethical issues; Silk Spectre II (Malin Ackerman), the daughter of a previous hero; Night Owl II (Patrick Wilson), a more virtuous hero with gadgets reminiscent of Batman; Rorsharch (Jackie Earle Haley), a masked vigilante outlaw type; and Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), a seemingly effeminate yet nearly invincible capitalist.<br /><br />I actually waited for the performances to be a bit of a disappointment, but they were not nearly as bad I had heard and expected from seeing how other actors perform within a Snyder film.  In fact, Haley's role as Rorsharch was actually exceptional.  He had a tremendous presence and seemed to know the character more deeply than his cast-mates.  It most likely helped of course that his character is more intense and tragic than the others.  On the flip side, Ackerman was flat more often than not, but she looked great.  Crudup can't be blamed as his character is no longer human.  Morgan was also great as the Comedian but I'll confess that I was not aware that he wasn't Robert Downey Jr. until after I watched the movie.  My other minor complaints would be the make-up used to age some of the characters like Silk Spectre I (Carla Gugino) and Richard Nixon (Robert Wisden) and that Phobos and Deimos would not appear the way they do on the Martian landscape like they do here.  That last one is admittedly a really silly nitpicking.<br /><br />There are many positive things to say about the visual effects but that should be pretty obvious just from the commercials.  The story is a hugely creative one and even when watered down for the screen it still serves as the film's strongest point by far.  It is more than enough to provoke some deeper thinking than other films within this sub-genre, but the pace of the story almost made me hope for a mini-series on Showtime or HBO at first.  In the end I had no problem with the slower scenes, but I know that some viewers did and will.  Still, Snyder and company make the film work well enough to give it a strong recommendation.</p></body></html>

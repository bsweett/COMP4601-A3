The story captures the obsessions of the era (based on a novel written in the 50's) of the fears of Communism and mind control.  It wouldn't be written today but it's still amazing to watch it.<br /><br />The cast is first rate.  Lawrence Harvey's accent wavers a bit but his stony intensity is perfect for the role of the psychologically damaged young man.  Frank Sinatra is so enjoyable to watch. (I wish he had made more films) Actually I thought Streep did a better job of bringing the creepy psychological stuff to the role; Landsbury is good at being bossy but comes across mostly as a 50's ladies' club woman.  (One can only wonder what Lucille Ball would have done with the role?)<br /><br />The fact that the film was pulled out of circulation by Sinatra after the assination of his friend, JFK, adds another note of pathos to the story.<br /><br />We have a new set of villains these days but this film is so raw and right-on that it's still chilling to watch.</p></body></html>

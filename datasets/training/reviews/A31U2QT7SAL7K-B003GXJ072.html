As Ridley Scott says in the liner notes for the DVD, this &quot;director's cut&quot; just adds some deleted scenes from the original in exchange for some removals; however, the story remains the same and it's still worth viewing. Purists can be satisfied with original, also presented on disc one.<p>The second disc is a treat for every fan or anyone interested in the process of filmmaking.  With insightful commentary and &quot;making of&quot; anecdotes from all the cast (with the exception of Yaphet Kotto), director Scott, special effects wizard Brian Johnson, writers Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett, composer Jerry Goldsmith, and a bevy of other creative talents, everything that one ever wanted to know about the film is here.<p>This DVD has the extras that most skimp on; it is truly a collector's treasure.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Go Bananas over this set :)"></head><body><p>With all the reviews of each film all over the place, I will make short and simple. Planet of the Apes is the best of the whole series, however the other films, Beneath, Conquest, Escape and Battle for the Planet of the Apes all are worth watching. They might not be as good as the first, but they all have their own merits. Obviously the budgets sank as the series moved on, but they are all entertaining in their own way. To me it was worth owning the entire set, you get the whole series, widescreen, THX , super sharp transfers and a bonus disc for under 40.00. Even if I didn't like one of the movies Id still get the whole set , which is what I usually do if I enjoy most of the movies of a set (3 out 4, 2 out of 3,etc)<br />For those who haven't gone Blu-Ray this is still the best set to get.<br />In closing, yes Planet of the Apes is the superior film of the whole bunch but I think the rest all hold up well with great acting, stories & the constant battle of man vs ape,plus the endings are incredible. To me the whole set is worth getting...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A good movie that could have been a little better!"></head><body><p>John Ottway (Liam Neeson) is living in the frigid Northwest Territories on a petroleum drilling and refining plant. His job is to protect the workers from the wildlife that surrounds the plant. While traveling to Anchorage via plane, the almost full aircraft encounters bad weather and temperature so cold that it finally crashes. When he wakes up he finds 7 men capable of moving and the rest are dead or dying.<br /><br />They believe that their injuries and subzero weather will kill them until the wolves arrive and they realize that they have even more serious problems......<br /><br />This movie is a good story but it is also very gruesome so be warned. Both the plane crash and the wolf attacks are bloody. The men struggle to survive and face all of the elements that nature can throw at them. The movie is well filmed and the actors do a good job portraying their roles. Liam Neeson is especially good as the group leader take charge type of guy.<br /><br />For me what detracted from the movie was that these aggressive and intelligent men could not form weapons of any major type. They leave the crashed plane and all of the supplies and potential weapons they could have made from metal to wander into the frigid artic wilderness. This movie was good but it could have been so much more if the men hadn't forgotten everything they could have done more easily.<br /><br />My wife and I still enjoyed the movie and I recommend it to you as a suspenseful story about survival. I just wish that one time you could watch a movie of this type and have some of the protagonists do more of the right things!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Spielberg from the heart, and he tugs hard................"></head><body><p>A very intimate, touching, and believable film about a boy that connects with an Alien deeper then we can imagine. He is 8, we would be the same with the little guy. People are dissing the newly remasterd version, don't watch it, you get both versions on the DVD, personally, I like the new C.G.I. effects, quite mindblowing and lifelike. Forget about that stuff, indulge in the story, and the ending is fantastic, a definate tearjearker. And remember people, it is a film and fantasy, look at Spielbergs intent, that what roams in outerspace is not always scary and violent, but have feelings like us. WOW, THAT IS NEW. A fantasic twist and a must see film for family. The extras are very worthy.</p></body></html>

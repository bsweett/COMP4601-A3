<meta name="summary" content="Not Pleasant but"></head><body><p>I haven't seen "House of a 1000 Corpses" however, this is an interesting film - would have been 3 and a half stars for me.<br /><br />The violence is very unpleasant and there is also quite a lot of nudity (women of course) and inferred sexual violence as well. But don't watch it if you're easily upset by these things.<br /><br />Unlike some previous reviewers I disagree about the acting and the directing. Some of the cutting/editing was very clever and most of the time the acting was pretty good. There is an edge of very black comedy (ala the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre) in this film. OK it is very black and I didn't actually laugh but I assure you it is there. This is helped by a classic soundtrack of 70's rock (the film is set in 1978), which provides a very strange contrast to the extreme violence being portrayed.<br /><br />The murderous family are quite believable, and there continual bickering with each other has a ring of truth about it. Look out for Geoffery Lewis a veteran of the two Clint Eastwood "Every Which..." films.<br /><br />In all honesty you don't really care what happens to the people in the film, but it is strangly compelling viewing.</p></body></html>

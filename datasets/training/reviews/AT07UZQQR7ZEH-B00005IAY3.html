<meta name="summary" content="A science fiction masterpiece looks better than ever"></head><body><p>On its thirtieth anniversary, Steven Spielberg's UFO masterpiece, CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND (1977), seems as fresh and wondrous as a child's birthday present.  UFO's appear in the night skies over Indiana and kidnap little Cary Guffey.  His poor mom, Melinda Dillon, has no idea that the aliens are friendly.  Richard Dreyfuss sees the sightings also and all but ignores wife Teri Garr to follow them all over Indiana in a truck.  After Dreyfuss makes a giant mountain of earth in his living room without knowing why, Garr takes their son and leaves him.  But he's too busy trying to figure out what obsesses him about the mountain.<br /><br />Then Dreyfuss and Dillon realize at the same time what the mountain means--Devil's Tower in Wyoming.  But what is the mystery of Devil's Tower?  Pretty soon they are joining forces by truck to head for Wyoming.  What compels their journey?  I'm not even sure Spielberg, as writer and director, knows.  Over thirty years, he has re-edited his movie at least three times--from 135 minutes, to 132 minutes, to a Director's Cut of 137 minutes that leaves out several scenes I remember, including the inside of the space ship at the film's finale.  Anyway, our intrepid duo reach Devil's Tower.  Ironically, the Army arrest them as aliens!<br /><br />The last third of CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, secretly filmed in an Alabama warehouse, has some of the most spectacular visual effects in movie history and won Vilmos Zsigmond a Cinematography Oscar for his brilliant work, in tandem with at least five other cinematographers all over the world, including Douglas Slocombe in northern India.  (The great Douglas Trumbull gets Visual Effects credit, along with Spielberg.)  Legendary French filmmaker Francois Truffaut has a nice supporting role as a French scientist who initially wants to know what Dreyfuss knows.  But he turns out benign.  This was one of the first mainstream Hollywood movies to treat extra-terrestrials sympathetically.  (Spielberg's E.T. was still five years in the future.)  And it is still one of the best ever, helped immeasurably by John Williams' ethereal score and an innate intelligence toward UFOs.  Young Guffey's final scene is particularly lovely as he waves goodbye to the departing spaceship.<br /><br />I still wish Spielberg had kept in the scene he replaced in the 1980's for TV where we go inside the spaceship at the end.  But my Mom thinks it is more satisfying to let us wonder what the interior is like and who is inside.  Judge Crater?  Lee Harvey Oswald?  Marilyn Monroe?  I still fondly remember "When You Wish Upon a Star" from PINOCCHIO playing inside, but maybe my Mom is right on Spielberg's decision.  He and longtime editor Michael Kahn (still his editor of choice) seem to have imperceptibly improved the middle of a long 137 minute movie.<br /><br />CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND is magnificent filmmaking that holds up beautifully after thirty years.  Though his SCHINDLER'S LIST (1993) and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (1998) are mature adult works of art, Spielberg still has no equals for creating great popular movie entertainment for kids of all ages--like the INDIANA JONES trilogy.  CLOSE ENCOUNTERS is worth another look if you have not seen it in a while.<br /><br />I am reviewing a $10 drugstore DVD with no bonuses, but restored color, THX sound, and letterboxing for Panavision.  You might want to spend more and get the two disk set with bonuses on how the astonishing UFO's were created.</p></body></html>

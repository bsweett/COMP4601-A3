Gary Gray<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Action / Thriller<br />Release Date: 16 October 2009<br /><br />I don't know exactly what I was expecting Law Abiding Citizen to be like; but I know I wasn't expecting Saw meets The Punisher! It's a thriller more than an action or horror picture, but it embodies similar elements of both these genres.<br /><br />You need to ensure that when you take your seat, you are completely ready, because when the movie starts, it starts! I'm not sure whether it was due to editing for time or if it was the filmmaker's direct intention, but we get the wind knocked out of us from the get-go. While I was not a fan of this method for this particular film, I can see how most will appreciate it a great deal.<br /><br />We meet Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) and his family for about three seconds before they are attacked by two intruders. Clyde witnesses his wife and daughter being butchered and brutalized in front of his very eyes, before being left for dead himself. I'll admit it was very shocking, but we don't even get to know the characters at all before they are slain; so for the rest of the film we have no sense of who they were. Two or three minutes more with them would have been sufficient for me.<br /><br />We move forward and learn Clyde has survived and that the assistant district attorney of Philadelphia, Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx), has been appointed to his case. Nick is rushed and impatient with Clyde when he does not agree to the plea-bargain that Nick has been ordered by the DA to make; one of the killers will testify against his partner for a lessoned prison sentence. Nick believes this deal is better than no deal, as due to a loop-hole, both killers could walk. Nick informs him that it's too late to negotiate; the deal has gone through and that's just the way the system works.  Clyde is devastated but there is nothing he can do. Or is there?<br /><br />10 years go by and Nick has had a successful career and now has a daughter of his own. We have no idea what Clyde has been up to; until the execution of one of the killers goes horribly wrong. When the other killer winds up brutally murdered, all evidence points directly to Clyde.<br /><br />It's clear that Clyde expected to be arrested because after these two sadistic, well planned killings (which I will not describe in detail), we know he is smarter than anyone else in the film.<br /><br />Once arrested, he outsmarts Nick in a very well written and acted scene and that's just the first of many similar amazing moments. More people start dying; all linked to Clyde's case. But Clyde is locked up. Can he really be responsible? Yes he can. We learn along with everyone else in the film, that Clyde is not your every day guy.<br /><br />He has a past similar to that of Rambo. In one particular scene, Nick interviews someone that Clyde worked with in the past. The man flat out tells Nick, "If he wants you dead... you're dead."<br /><br />On top of all that, Clyde's spent the last decade familiarizing himself with the law and the supposed justice system. Eventually he is in a place to bargain with the city and Nick is forced to act as a liaison between Clyde and Philadelphia. Clyde gets under Nick's skin by asking for ridiculous favors in exchange for some self-incriminating information. He is exposing how corrupt the system actually is.<br /><br />One of the great things about a film like Law Abiding Citizen is that you are entertained visually by the action sequences, but at the same time this is a film that really makes you think. You can't help but ask yourself what you would do if you were in Clyde's shoes and this happened to you.<br /><br />I didn't feel like Jamie Foxx really brought his full potential to this film like I have seen him do in others. On the other hand, he's such an extraordinary actor that perhaps this role was just too simple for him.<br /><br />Gerard Butler is an amazing actor. He has a wide range of roles he can play. From his barbarian of a character in 300 to his romantic side in P.S., I Love You; Butler has shown us his vast range of talent.  In this film you believe him in every scene and he and Foxx make a good match for each other.<br /><br />Some of the things Clyde pulls off are a little far-fetched; but the film was beautifully written and directed, and is full of twists and turns that you will never see coming. The movie races forward like a bullet tearing through flesh and we are along for the ride, loving every minute of it.</p></body></html>

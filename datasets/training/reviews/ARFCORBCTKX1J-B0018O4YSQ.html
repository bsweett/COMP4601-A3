<meta name="summary" content="the waking dream"></head><body><p>It's probably fitting that my review of "Dark City" follows my review of "Metropolis". The former owes a lot -- at least visually -- to the latter. You'd have to be blind not to see it, and the supplemental material even includes a too-brief discussion of the films' similarities. There's an excerpt of a 1927 review of "Metropolis" from H G Wells, which pretty much nails everything wrong about /that/ "silly film".<br /><br />But this is about "Dark City". The film's mysteries gradually unwind in a way that's perfectly clear to the characters and the viewer, with The Basic Reveal coming about 40 minutes before the end (in the extended version), so there's no need to describe the plot. However, I think most viewers will recognizethe analogy with the dream state in which we are assaulted by unknown forces, yet are able to perform seeming miracles (teleportation, walking through walls, etc) that protect us.<br /><br />The DVD of "Dark City" was one of the first DVDs I bought a dozen years ago. It's a beautiful film that did not come across very well on a letterboxed 32" screen. It really needs an HD transfer and a 50" or larger display to reveal just how magnificent it is. (I might also add that it's hard to believe Alex Proyas also directed the miserably sloppy/boring "I, Robot".)<br /><br />This is a gorgeous demo disk with uncompressed 7.1 sound. If the strange and the wonderful appeal to you, it's strongly recommended, at a price that makes it very nearly an impulse purchase.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Chronicles of Riddick"></head><body><p>In 2000, we were introduced to Riddick (Diesel), a criminal who can see in the dark.  With the video success of "Pitch Black" and the interest of Vin Diesel, a sequel was inevitable.  "Chronicles" finds Riddick five years later, and still on the run from bounty hunters.  When he crosses paths with old friend Inam (David), he learns that he may be the only one who is able to stop the Necromongers, lead by Lord Marshall (Feore).  The Necromongers are gearing up to destroy Inam's planet, and Riddick has landed there just in time.  He soon is on his way to save Jack (Davalos), a friend from the previous movie that may be able to help him out.  Throw in Dame Judi Dench, and you even have a touch of class in this sci-fi action extravaganza.<p>Vin Diesel could very well have a real franchise on his hands here if "Chronicles" is able to make a dent at the box office.  Filled with action and amazing special effects, "Chronicles" seems poised to do just that.  The ending also provides a jumping off point to further adventures, so don't be surprised to see more of Riddick in a few years.</p></body></html>

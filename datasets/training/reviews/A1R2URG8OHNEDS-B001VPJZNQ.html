<meta name="summary" content="The Best Action Film of the Year!"></head><body><p>The year started off with "Daredevil." Decent but not good enough. Lighter action films took place such as "Agent Cody Banks", "The Core", and then "Bulletproof Monk." Then a few bigger ones came like "Bad Boys II", "Lara Croft Tomb Raidor The Cradle of Life", "SWAT," and "The Medallion." But none of those hold a candle to the fun, excitment, and action packed laughs as "The Rundown" the film where The Rock proves that he can be a good actor. He is joined by "American Pies" Sean William Scott and "Catch Me If You Can's" Christopher Walken, along with the help of Rosario Dawson of "Men in Black II." But I think that the best performance is The Rock. He started his acting career in 2001's "The Mummy Returns" but wasn't in it enough. He then took another movie spinoff of The Mummy in his "Returns" character "The Scorpion King." But the problem with that movie was that there was not enough dialouge to make me think of him as a good actor. It was mostly running or him doing his trademark look from wrestling. I don't think in any of the 104 minutes of "The Rundown" he does anything close to his trademark look. <p>In this movie The Rock plays Beck, an expect finder. He always gies people two options. For instance, in the beginning when trying to get a ring he gives them option A which is "Give me the ring," or option B which is "Have me make you give me the ring." Most people always choose the latter which NOT the way to go. He then proceeds to give you the beating of a lifetime. But he wants to get out of that and open his own resturant. His boss Billy agrees to let him be out, as long as he does one last job for him. The job is to travel to Brazel, the jungle, to get Billy's son Travis, who has been in the jungle searching for treasure. But he's gotten into so much trouble that his father has had to bail him out of prison. He is flown there by Declan and thinks that finding Travis will be a quick job, in and out. But of course problems arouse. Beck meets Hatcher, a businessman who uses the locals as slaves to mine gold for him. Hatcher finds Travis for him but when he finds out that Travis knows where a great artifact is, he decides not to let Beck take him back to his waiting father. But a fight between Beck and Hatcher, has Hatcher and his men wanting to find Travis and Beck dead. They do flee into the jungle, with Travis sturggling to regain his freedom. They do get help from local bartender Mariana who is looking for the same artifact that Travis knows where it is, so she can liberate her people. <p>"The Rundown" is loaded with action, effects, and comedy. It's loads of fun as well. It's not just a predictable action comedy, and they don't even use the character of Mariana as a love intertest to the character of Beck. Beck basically wanted to finsh the job so he can fullfill his dreams of becoming of chef in his resturant. I think that after this great work of film, The Rock can finally start starring in action movies that are worth seeing on the screen. His "The Scorpion King" was a good movie, but it's more of a movie that you rent rather then pay a large sum of money to see on the big screen. "The Mummy Returns" he had a very smaller part and it was his film debut so you pretty much didn't know what to expect. But he is a movie star now, because "The Rundown" proves it.<p>ENJOY!<p>Rated PG-13 for adventure violence and some crude dialogue.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Jamie Foxx This Is Your Movie!"></head><body><p>Jaime Foxx, you are the man!  What a performance. First, he comes across as the articulate, smooth -operator taxi driver.  Knows the routes into, around and out of LA, and can guesstimate the amount of time it will take for the drive. It doesn't appear he is wrong at all. Then, he loves his momma. And, as a man driven literally by a madman he is able to fulfill the role of a hero.<br /><br />Tom Cruise first appears as a sophisticated older man with grey hair and an air of a man on the make. It doesn't take long before we forget the color of his hair. It is the action of his gun and his stance and his body movements, all together, that make this man look deadly and menacing.<br /><br />Jada Pinckett Smith has a small role, but she is able in this amount of time to let us know she is a beautiful, intelligent woman who understands who she is and what she wants.<br /><br />Mark Ruffalo plays a local LA Detective. He knows and understands "something" isn't right about the 3-4 deaths coming into the morgue on this night- all the bullets from the same gun. And, then the taxi- the same type of scene heard before with 4 unanswered deaths and now this taxi man.  Wait, wait, Max the taxi driver isn't the man!<br /><br />"Collateral" directed by Michael Mann is an action movie, beautifully photographed by hand-held cameras. Always moving, always studied and superb.  The story is that of a hired gun, a hitman, and in this instance hired to kill all involved in some sort of trial. The high tech communicatopn of the "hits" is amazing. As the movie proceeds, Tom Cruise, as Vincent, first hires Max, Jamie Foxx, to drive him to his five destinations, then Demands he drive. Max begins to understand his role after the first murder and tries valiantly to stop this madness and get away. Vincent is cruel- he knows his job and he will stop at nothing.<br /><br />The action is fast, the soundtrack is brilliant, and I was so disappointed to learn the sound tract was not recorded.  All in all, this is the movie that .I will remember as Jamie Foxx becomes his character. There is "Ray", of course, but this role as Max, the taximan is Jamie as I will remember him.<br />Highly recommended. prisrob</p></body></html>

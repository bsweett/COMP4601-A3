Overall, this was a good movie with great visuals. Stanley Tucci was amazing as the creepy neighbor and Saoirse Ronan as Susie Salmon, acted well as his victim.<br />Rachel Weisz as her mother was fair but her character was not well developed. Susan Sarandon as the Susie's grandmother was okay. Mark Wahlberg as Susie's father managed to display as a father struggling to come to terms of his daughter death was excellent. I had read the book may years ago so had forgotten the minute details of this story but I still enjoyed the movie. I gave it three stars...6/10/10</p></body></html>

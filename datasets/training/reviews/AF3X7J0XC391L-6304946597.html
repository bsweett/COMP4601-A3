It does a fair job in historical accuracy of the events that surrounded his contraversial career and demonstrates the character, flaws and all, that made him so. Though Mr. George C. Scott's voice matches the General's character more than his actual voice, the casting choice was otherwise a perfect match. A fantastic biographical work of the scrappy general.</p></body></html>

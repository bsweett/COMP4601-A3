<meta name="summary" content="ONE OF BEST WRITTEN AND CLASSIEST OF THE CLASSICS"></head><body><p>I'm guessing Casablanca is the most referenced film in history. There is good reason for this, as you can cut the mystique surrounding it with a knife. It has one of the finest scripts, among other things. The story behind the writing of Casablanca is legendary. Without getting into the details, writers Julius and Philip Epstein, along with Howard Koc, would finish a scene and rush it over to the set in time to be shot; then they'd write the next one. No one knew how the story would end. As it turned out, it ended up one of the classiest and most iconic of all classic films.<br /><br />In Casablanca, isolated from war-torn Europe, political alliances and hatreds are bubbling, but no one can do anything about them, as it is a neutral country. In the midst of this hotbed, enigmatic Rick (Humphrey Bogart) owns the swankiest nightclub in town,  the Cafe Americane. It is a place to meet, drink and gamble, and to listen to Sam's piano playing; but it's also a place to plot how to obtain one of the rare exit visas to leave Casablanca and fly to the New World.<br /><br />One night, breathtakingly beautiful Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) and her stoic husband, Victor Laslo (Paul Henreid), show up in Rick's. Laslo is an international hero, fighting for the  resistance against the Third Reich. They have come to Casablanca because he is being hunted by the Nazis, and Casablanca is about the only place to catch a flight out of occupied Europe.<br /><br />Flashback: the story is a love triangle, but it is innocent enough. Rick and Ilsa were in love in pre-war, romantic Paris. The lovers made plans to leave Paris before the Germans marched in, but on the night they were supposed to leave, Ilsa's husband, whom she had thought was dead, resurfaced; so, she left Rick standing in the train station in the rain with no explanation.<br /><br />Now in Casablanca, Victor and Ilsa need exit visas like everyone else, but the Germans are determined not to let them leave. It is rumored that Rick has letters of transit, which are even better, stolen off two dead German couriers. But no one knows where Rick's loyalties lie. Ilsa uses her old relationship with Rick to try and get them - not so much for herself as for Victor. But Rick is still nursing his wounds from Paris.<br /><br />At the same time, Ilsa is torn between her old love for Rick and her continued love for Victor. Rick reveals that he is still in love with her; but makes a great show of not believing in causes or heroes. Is that really the way he is? Everything hinges on what Rick will do. Everyone thinks they know him, but no one is sure. As the tension mounts, his character is the key to everyone's future.<br /><br />Casablanca is full of interesting and wonderful characters, played by some of the best character actors at the time. Claude Rains is the debonair but corrupt prefect of police and Rick's friend, Captain Renault. Conrad Veidt plays the despicable Nazi Major Strasser. Sydney Greenstreet is his usual mercenary and rotund self as Rick's business competition, Signor Ferrari. Peter Lorre is the pitifully underhanded Ugarte. S.Z. (Cuddles) Sakall is the wonderfully sentimental waiter Carl. Madeleine LeBeau plays the singer Yvonne. Dooley Wilson is Rick's man and pianist, the memorable Sam. The list goes on and on.<br /><br />The ambiance of Casablanca, and of Rick's Cafe Americane in particular, is part of the wonder of the film. Warner Bros. created a world that, even though it was threatening and war-torn, continues to mesmerize audiences. We can't get enough of Rick's or the interesting characters who frequent it. As they say in the film, "Everyone comes to Rick's." We also can't seem to get enough of that classic 1940's style: the dinner jackets, the evening dresses - even the uniforms. The 40's were the apex of sartorial style.<br /><br />There are so many memorable quotes from Casablanca that you could almost reproduce the script en mass recalling them.<br /><br />Casablanca won three Oscars: Best Director (Michael Curtiz), Best Picture (Hal Wallis) and Best Screenplay (Julius Epstein, Philip Epstein and Howard Koch). It was also nominated for Best Actor (Bogart), Best Supporting Actor (Claude Rains), Best Cinematography (Arthur Edeson), Best Film Editing (Owen Marks) and Best Music Score (Max Steiner).<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></body></html>

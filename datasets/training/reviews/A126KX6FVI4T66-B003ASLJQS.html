<meta name="summary" content="clearer than the book"></head><body><p>Sean Penn's acting actually makes the petty crook come alive better than in the book.<br />Three boys just messing around on the city streets in a poor suburb<br />are targeted by predatory adults. One of them gets into the car<br />which the policemen who aren't.<br />Their lives are forever changed by that one moment.<br />The boy who gets in and his two friends become grown ups<br />in a strange way:one a cop, one a crook and the other just<br />a struggling confused fellow who drinks way too much.<br />The death of the 19 year old daughter of the crook<br />brings out old time troubles that had been mostly forgotten,<br />like a murder and that time locked in the cellar.<br />What results is a tragedy where again<br />the third guys gets in another car with two predators.<br />Who the real killer is comes as a big surprise to everyone.</p></body></html>

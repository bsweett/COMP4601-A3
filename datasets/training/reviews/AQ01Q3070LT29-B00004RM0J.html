<meta name="summary" content="Goonies Reunion!  Entire younger cast is reunited."></head><body><p>The entire younger cast of The Goonies are reunited on this DVD version in the Special Features/Commentary With Hidden Treasures. On camera is Jonathan Ke Quan (Key Huy Quan), Corey Feldman, Sean Astin, Director Richard Donner, Kerri Green, Martha Plimpton, Jeff Cohen and Josh Brolin.<br /> The reunion and commentary is fun to hear and see.  Also in the Special Features section are three outtakes, the original theatrical trailer, a short documentary "The Making Of The Goonies", and the Cyndi Lauper music video "The Goonies 'R' Good Enough" Part One and Part Two.  The first outtake is 3 minutes long. The second  and third outtakes are about 2 minutes long.  Watch out for that giant octopus!<br />  I enjoyed the reunion of the cast.</p></body></html>

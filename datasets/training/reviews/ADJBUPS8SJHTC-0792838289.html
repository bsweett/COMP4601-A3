I got real interested in this movie after they voted Mrs Icelin as the one of the top villianess to the AFI poll on villans and villianess(sic). So I had to see what the fuss was all about, and to be honest, Ms Lansbury was no peach in this role for sure. I am still trying to understand how she could allow her own son to kill folks coldbloodedly, and for personal ambition at that. But the movie itself will keep you hanging on to your seats. My sympathies went to the guys who kept having nightmares on something they actually gone through. And for his wife. She just didn't have a clue nor a chance. A great movie full of suspense, a bit or romance and plenty intrigue. Worth the look</p></body></html>

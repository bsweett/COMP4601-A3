Basically many of the scenes simply look BLURRY and out of focus, it's unavoidably noticeable and made me CRINGE in agony upon seeing such scenes in the movie. To me this is an overall letdown and I don't know if they can put out a better version... maybe it's just the nature of the source material that cannot be enhanced without also enhancing original problems with those certain camera shots?</p></body></html>

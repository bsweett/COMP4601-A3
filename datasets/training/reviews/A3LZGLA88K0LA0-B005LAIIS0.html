<meta name="summary" content="ONE MORE DAY INTO THE FRAY"></head><body><p>Liam Neeson continues his string of action hits with THE GREY.  The story is fairly simple:  8 survivors of a horrifying plane crash in a hostile Alaskan wilderness must face Mother Nature--and a ferocious pack of hungry wolves.  Along the way, there are moments of male bonding and character expositions.<br />Director Joe Carnahan who assaulted us with the A-TEAM reboot helms the film, which boasts one of the most frightening and realistic plane crashes caught on film.  The film has a brutally beautiful canopy, and lends an air of desperation and loneliness.  Neeson is powerful as usual, a little more vulnerable than in TAKEN or UNKNOWN.  THE GATES' Frank Grillo makes good use of his first big movie role as the blustery macho man whose false bravado masks his true personality--a star-making performance.  Dermot Mulroney eschews his leading man persona in his laidback role and Dallas Roberts brings his usual "everybody's friend" image to fuller fruition.  The entire cast is good, but it's basically Neeson and Grillo's movie.<br />THE GREY is a dark survival film, flashing moments of painful optimism crushed by brutal reality.</p></body></html>

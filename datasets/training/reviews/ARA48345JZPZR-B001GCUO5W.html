It is all on display here, in his latest collaboration with Leonardo DiCaprio.  Moody and dark and imbued with an atmosphere of paranoia and dread, of deep mystery and conspiracy, I was completely caught up in this effort to take genre material and find new energy and inventiveness within it.<br /><br />The early scenes were so overlain with sombre music and portents I was afraid it was going to be too much, but quickly was mesmerized by the tension Scorcese creates and the imagery he creates to bring the movie down into the realm of conscious and unconscious fear and nightmare, of reality and memory. And it is great imagery and flawless technique that continues to spin the tale as it pitches through raging storms without and within toward a conclusion that I was afraid might be a let down, but I found, while not unexpected, surprisingly workable and satisfying.  And, there is even a final kicker that really makes it all worthwhile!<br /><br />I have to admit I find some critics mystifying.  I think the two doofuses on TV said to Skip It.  Really? Compared to what?  I have to wonder why some people go to the movies.  Is it an intellectual exercise?  Sure, there's that sometimes, but can't they ever allow themselves to be seduced by the sheer ebullience of people working at the top of their game with familiar yet re-imagined material?  To suspend belief just for fun? Shutter Island didn't spring from a world where themes of insanity and conspiracy have never been dealt with before, but it does so with originality and force!<br /><br />I confess there is still a kid in me that can put aside pre-conceived notions and intellectual pretenses and simply be swept up in the vision of master craftsmen working with good writing and interesting material. It worked for me here.  I can understand if it doesn't for you, but anyone saying the movie doesn't have punch and interest, well....aw, whatever.</p></body></html>

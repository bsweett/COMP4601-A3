It is about Leonardo Dicaprio as the son of Liam Neeson, who confronts Daniel Day Lewis and his gang in a turf war but is slain before his five-year-old eyes. All very Shakespearean, with revenge as the prime motivator throughout. Besides Bill "the Butcher" Cutting and his gang, there are the many other gangs, the criminals, the thieves and stealers, as well as the remnants of the Irish gang Dead Rabbits, with ghouls like Hellcat Maggie and all the rest of the filth and scum that make their living in the wickedest den of scum and villainy. People living sad, fearful lives where even the sex is frightening and traumatic. There are parallels and betrayals and regret and valour, but mostly there is a fearful loss of life, with no honour. What a crazy world. Is it still like this? The most interesting point is when the film ends with the fearsome New York Draft Riots of that year, showing a time when anti-draft sentiment was whipped up and the mobs marched on the house of the mayor, destroying everything, when they looted and raped and lynched, and when they fought against the cannons that the military had to fire on more than just the four dead in Ohio.</p></body></html>

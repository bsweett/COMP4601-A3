<meta name="summary" content="Across the Universe"></head><body><p>The Beatles are a hot commodity, and with good reason. They started what became known as the "British Invasion" of the 1960's, and are the most commercially and critically successful group of the modern era. For that reason their song catalogue has been sought out by many industries from Cirque du Soleil to movies. One would think a biopic would have been made about The Beatles by now, but nothing more than the stories of their early years (Backbeat, Nowhere Boy).<br /><br />While there still hasn't been a biopic about The Beatles, artists have found many interesting ways to utilize and pay tribute to the music of The Beatles. Director Julie Taymor (Frida, The Lion King on Broadway) had a great idea to craft a new musical around The Beatles' song list called Across the Universe. The result was a coming of age story set during American turmoil during the late 1960's and features 33 songs from The Beatles ranging from early classics such as "All My Loving" and "I Want to Hold Your Hand" to later tracks such as "Oh! Darling" and "Something".<br /><br />Young Liverpudlian, Jude (Jim Sturgess), moves from England to New York in an effort to make it as an artist in America and to find his birth father who works at Harvard. While at Harvard he meets a rebellious student there named Max (Joe Anderson) and they become friends, and Max brings him to his home in Dayton, OH where Jude falls in love with Max's sister Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood). Things begin to unravel for the group as Max gets drafted for the Vietnam War and Lucy joins an antiwar group.<br /><br />If anything can be said about Julie Taymor, it's that she is an extremely visual and artistic director. Her visual sense at times lends itself to make elements of the film feel surreal and even avant-garde. She also has a real eye for authenticity. Across the Universe really draws you back to the times of the `60's and her staging of the Detroit race riots and the antiwar riots makes the tension feel palpable. Taymor lends an edge to the film that brings you back to that era, while also representing parallels to today's political climate while not glorifying one side over another.<br /><br />To me, musicals are always best when actors actually know how to perform and sing their own songs. Adding to that is the fact that most of the actors and actresses in this film are relative unknowns, allowing you to feel their performances more thoroughly. There are several cameos that really steal the show when it comes to performances though. Eddie Izzard has brilliant fun playing Mr. Kite (the circus leader in "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite"), and Joe Cocker plays three different roles (pimp, bum, and hippie) while crooning "Come Together". Bono steals his scenes as Dr. Robert during an upscale book signing event.<br /><br />While Taymor has added some brilliant flourishes to this film, her tendencies toward avant-garde and surrealism takes away from the story as a whole. At times the plot feels disjointed and major lapses in the films time frame can cause the viewer to lose focus of exactly what's going on in the narrative. There's also such a huge cast that some of the characters aren't fleshed out as much as they should be. For example, Prudence (TV Carpio) seems to be more of an excuse to use the song "Dear Prudence" and she's not much more than a closet lesbian throughout the narrative.<br /><br />Despite its flaws, Across the Universe is a fun and engrossing film. All of the elements are there to appeal to just about anyone: romance, comedy, drama, and even a little action. Visually the film is impeccable. If you're a fan of the music of The Beatles, or you're just looking for a film that gives a little something for everyone I highly recommend that you check this out.<br /><br />3/5<br /><br />Be sure to check out: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006K7WZ7S">Armadillo & Sands: Intellectual Properties at Work</a>!</p></body></html>

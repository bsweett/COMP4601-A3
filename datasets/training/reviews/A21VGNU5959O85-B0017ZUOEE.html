Check. Is it English, or Spanish or German? Check, I do not just buy one because it's "supposed" to be "like" some other movie. Foreign movies offer us so much but so many people shun them because they cannot get past the subtitles "I couldn't read and watch at the same time" that baffles me, you can't drive and read road signs either? Or commercials with words? Not everything is in English, and let me give you a word of advice, listening to the dubbed versions is an affront to the movie makers and the actors in it. 90% of the movies charm and impact is in the voices, the sounds, the accents, open your mind a smidge and you will fall in love with foreign films as much as I have.<br /><br />The Orphanage is not written by Del Toro, he is a producer. It is written by Sergio Sanchez and directed by Juan Antonio Bayona. Del Toros name is on the front, because he is a well known and well respected writer director and producer and the masses will identify that this movie has someone amazing backing it. You should not however think that this movie is supposed to be like Pans Labyrinth or Hellboy.<br /><br />The Orphanage, La Orfanato is a skillfully made ghost/love story that is masterfully told and amazingly hauntingly beautiful. It's the kind of movie I wanted to see as a child, a story with everything!! It's not full of clich&eacute;s, unless loving and losing a child is a clich&eacute; now? It's a ghost story, there is going to be similar aspects to other movies, but resist comparing it and begin to understand it better. God, it's so gorgeously saturated with grief and beauty and emptiness and longing and hope, I couldn't stop my heart from almost bursting.<br /><br />I love when movies take back that frightening feeling with good old fashioned storytelling instead of fancy schmancy special effects like herky jerky motions and Computer generated craziness that you know isn't the least bit real. I would love to watch it in black and white one day!<br /><br />Love the addition of Geraldine Chaplin as the Medium, Charlie's Daughter is a wonderful riveting actress!<br /><br />So go rent this, buy it and I warn you don't watch it at night!</p></body></html>

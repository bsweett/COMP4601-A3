<meta name="summary" content="Great Tornado movie!"></head><body><p>Bill Paxton plays in this movie about two people who want to put this "instrument" into the funnel of a tornado to get lots of information on the tornado. Let's just say they barely escape with their lives!<br /><br />  Bill Paxton does a great job in this movie. This movie shows courage and persistance. I really enjoyed watching this movie! I definitely recommend this to you!</p></body></html>

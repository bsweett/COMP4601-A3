<meta name="summary" content="A HAUNTED HOUSE"></head><body><p>First time director Juan Antonio Bayona reveals a reverence for classic horror films in this haunted house thriller about a ghostly country orphanage unleashing secrets from the past. Some of the finest films of the suspense-horror genre; The Haunting (1963), The Innocents (1961), are given the tip of the hat, and even the opening credits pay homage to the rapid succession of images in Hitchcock's classic, Vertigo.<br /><br />A successful married couple (Belen Rueda, Fernando Cayo), with an HIV positive adopted son buy the dilapidated and abandoned orphanage where the wife lived as a child. Their intention to turn it into a home for other disadvantaged children runs afoul when the young son experiences the presence of long dead children.<br /><br />What The Orphanage does so well, is master the classic jump-in-your-seat scare. Not the all-out, sudden horrific image of a grotesque, face ravaged killer with a bloody knife suddenly appearing on screen, but the subtle and equally compelling frights of a hand reaching out from the darkeness and a door slamming shut. The Orphanage earns it's shudders while absorbing you into it's somewhat traditional gothic story.<br /><br />It's a bit unfortunate that the story eventually overwhelms the tone of the film, and the last half-hour or so, becomes a fearless damsel-in-distress climax which is not entirely satisfying.<br /><br />The cast is fine with notably child actor Roger Princep as the son in a masterful blend of innocence and mayhem, and Geraldine Chapman, as part of a psychic investigating team, in a perfectly executed segment confronting technology with the supernatural. My highest marks though go to the creepy and quiet soundtrack, which had me second-guessing just which sounds were coming from the TV speakers, and which were the sounds of my own home at night.<br /><br />In Spanish with English sub-titles.</p></body></html>

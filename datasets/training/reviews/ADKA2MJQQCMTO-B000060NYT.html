<meta name="summary" content="Too many loose ends ..."></head><body><p>I was wandering around the mall a few days ago with nothing to do, so I figured I'd treat myself to a movie.  I was actually looking to see Final Fantasy, but it turns out it was no longer playing.  Simply on a whim, as a replacement, I decided to go see 'Jeepers Creepers.'  Man what a disappointment.<br />My first groan came when I learned it was a Victor Salva film.  Salva, you may remember, is the convicted child-molester who had made the movie 'Powder.' I swore I'd never pay to see one of his movies and I was kicking myself when I realized my mistake.<p>My second error came relative to the plot.  Granted this is my own fault, I was told by a friend, the plot of the movie was similar to the Shirley Jackson story of 'The Lottery' where a town is sacrificing people to this demon that lived in a hole under a church.<br />That half-heard assessment turned out to also only be about half-right.  I won&#65533;t rehash the plot completely, but in this movie, the townspeople are unaware of the demon (in the beginning that is).<p>The plot, to me anyway, never really seemed to come together.  It seemed as if there were several points that it tried to make, and then just gave up on.  For example, why after the demon took whatever body part he needed, did he stitch all the corpses back up and together?  What was the idea behind making a point of the dead interracial couple? I thought it was going to be a murder mystery for a few moments after that.  Why did he even have a hole to the old church when he could have just walked down into the basement?  What the hell was with the woman with all the cats?  What was with all the crows everywhere?  Did they work for the Creeper or something?  Things like this just seemed to keep piling up to the point that I wasn't really enjoying the movie anymore.  It just seemed to be all over the place.<p>I don't know, I was admittedly really never into gore/horror movies very much.  This just didn't do anything to change my mind.</p></body></html>

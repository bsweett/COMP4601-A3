<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining but not the best of the series"></head><body><p>The main storyline focuses on Dr. Jean Gray, and her transformation into the Dark Phoenix which is quite interesting. Kelsey Grammer also appears as Dr. Hank McCoy, the Beast! I always loved this character from the vintage years of X-Men and Grammer is perfect casting. Beast and the Dark Phoenix make this one worth your time, but don't expect too much -- The Final Stand is just not quite as dramatically satisfying as the first 2 films in the series. This one is a fairly conventional allegory about tolerance with some excellent sci-fi elements and good performances from Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and Halley Berry as Storm.</p></body></html>

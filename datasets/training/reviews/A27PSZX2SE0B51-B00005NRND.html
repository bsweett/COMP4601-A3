Taken from a book by Du Lu Wang (which has been described in more than one place as "pulp"), there are elements within that we've all seen before: the headstrong young girl not wanting to go through with her arranged marriage; the smoldering but never realized love between two friends; the "you killed my master twenty years ago so now you must die" plot device.  These are not original.  Doesn't matter.<p>Take a look at what director Ang Lee puts on the screen.  On one hand, it's just gorgeous.  Witness the first crane-shot of Peking, the labyrinthine compound of Governor Yu, the desert, the reed forest, and the peasant village.  All are presented with wonderfully composed shots, which calls to mind haiku poetry rather than cinema.  On the other hand, it's kinetic and exhilarating.  I'm talking, of course, of the wonderful fight scenes.  Akin to "The Matrix", yes (same choreographer), but different in a very important way.  Whereas "The Matrix" was riddled with bullets and explosions, "Crouching Tiger" works well with its silences.  The Wudan warriors are economical in their movements, whether they are gliding on air, or wielding a sword.  Thus, the fight scenes are compact and quick, rather than flashy and fast.  And they are just astounding to watch.  My favourite pits Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) against Jen Yu (Ziyi Zhang) in the reed forest.  If you can suspend your disbelief, then I guarantee you'll see nothing as wondrous in the cinema this year.  The forest bends and sways as the combatants perform a samurai-like duel as if walking on tightropes.  Not to be outdone, Jen has two magnificent fights with Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), one at night in the courtyard and one in Yu's training ground.  They are both balletic and engrossing.<p>The actors here are all top notch.  Chow is strong as steel, yet manages litheness unparalleled in my memory.  There's a quiet scene near the middle of the film, where he practices Tai Chi like movements (with a warrior's edge) alone in a courtyard.  It's almost as thrilling to watch his power and grace in this scene than in his fight scenes.  Throw in his thespian eyes and you've got a real charismatic star.  Only he's not really the star, is he?  He takes a backseat in terms of screen time to the two women.  And they surely deserve it.  Yeoh is all quiet dignity, fierce intelligence, and repressed emotion.  Yet she can kick your ass six ways from Sunday if provoked properly.  Contrast this with the determination and passion that newcomer Zhang brings, and you see why Chow wasn't needed all that much.  Throw in a charismatic Chen Chang as Lo (he supplies both the love interest and comic relief), and you have a fine ensemble cast.</p></body></html>

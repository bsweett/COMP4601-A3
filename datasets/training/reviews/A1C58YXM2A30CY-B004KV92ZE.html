<meta name="summary" content="Life Lessons from Po the Panda - Fun Film!"></head><body><p>Kung Fu Panda was a cute story with some interesting messages told in a back-drop of martial arts mania.<br /><br />The panda is Po, a lazy bear whose father (a duck! -- they never explain that, which is humorous in itself) runs a noodle shop.  Their family has had many generations of noodle shops and he looks forward to the day when Po can take over the family business.<br /><br />But Po has other dreams.  He is the martial arts warrior looked up to by all.  He is the kung fu master who beats all enemies.  But then he wakes up, admires his action figures and goes back to work selling soup.<br /><br />I really liked how the story unfolded, with Po meeting his stars of the kung fu world, working with them and being elated to even see them.  But Tigress, Viper, Crane, Mantis and Monkey are less than thrilled when Po is named the Dragon Warrior.<br /><br />Themes:<br /><br />Pop philosophy make its way into this film as other animated features of this type.  There is the past which is history, tomorrow hasn't happened yet, so all you have is the NOW.  And the NOW is a gift, that's why it's called "present."  Cooool!<br /><br />All fun aside, I did have to admire Po and his not wanting to give up -- he did at first -- and how the master also changed, realizing that Po, being a different kind of fighter needed a different kind of training.  The mixing of kung fu and dumplings was hilarious.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Great story, detailed animation and wonderful voice actors come together to make this a fun movie to watch and learn from.  Martial arts purists might whine and complain, missing the point of this light bit of entertainment.  Can't wait for the sequel!<br /><br />Other Dreamworks Animated Pix:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001HN690O">Kung Fu Panda 2 (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GCUO7A">Monsters vs. Aliens</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000CABEZ">Dreamworks Animation Award-Winning Family Fun Pack (Spirit, The Prince of Egypt, Antz, Chicken Run, The Road to El Dorado)</a></p></body></html>

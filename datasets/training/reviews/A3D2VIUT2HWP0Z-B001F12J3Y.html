<meta name="summary" content="Totally Sublime One  Disc Edition"></head><body><p>I sort of wish I had got the Double Disc edition, but what I did get in the single disc edition was and is so magical, I can honestly say I am more than happy with it.<br /><br />The sound is totally beautiful; if you have a theatre sound system at home, this will be a beautiful watch. Every moment is a precious journey into the heart of a world of "Believe". Tom Hanks and Bob Zemickis must be commended for their roles, and their young actors who voiced that beautiful song done at the end of the train must be commended for such a heart rending performance.<br /><br />The biggest and best step with this journey is decided to get on the train: its a wonderful, beautiful, and sublime experience.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Nightmare Before Christmas"></head><body><p>Produced by Tim Burton (who also co-wrote the story), Henry Selick's Gothic holiday fantasy blends state-of-the-art stop-motion animation with an imaginative, light-heartedly eerie story about a clever spook who decides to reinvent Christmas. Along the way, the jack-o-lantern-headed Jack (amiably voiced by Chris Sarandon) has to square off against his evil nemesis, Oogie Boogie (Ken Page), who has sinister plans of his own. With Danny Elfman's frightfully jolly score and a bright script based on characters Burton created, this is a "Nightmare" the whole family will enjoy (though smaller fry might get spooked at times).</p></body></html>

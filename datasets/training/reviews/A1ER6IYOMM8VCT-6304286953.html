I have always loved Universal's Wolfman and was skeptical when they went with the four legged variety in this film, but it works. Rick Baker's effects are outstanding and the wolfman transformation still looks incredible. I personally like the mix of horror and dark humor in this film and having Claude Rains in this film is a respectful nod to the original! The DVD has a good transfer and some interesting extras.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Like a big chainsaw commercial..."></head><body><p>Certain things should better be left alone. Like, for example, certain cult movies from the depths of the 70s such as the "Texas chainsaw massacre". Now, those who've seen the original know that it had cultdom written all over it because it had this feel to it as if it was done based on a true story. Kinda like the recent "Blair Witch project" flick but even more so. <p>What the original didn't have was sexy babes runnin about in a hilarious scream-a-thon and a hillbilly family that wasn't scary but resembled rather the equivalent of Married with Children gone South.<p>  But lets get down to the painful details as far as this sorry remake is concerned. It'd be best if i went over a summarised list of the annoyances and nuisances in this movie:<p>- The chainsaw wielding guy is so overused in this movie that in a perverse way it looked as if Black n Decker was doing a very advanced, cutting-edge, long commercial about its new line of products.<br />- Not only was the chainsaw guy overused, but eventually he turns out to be a focal comedy point in the film, as he seems to be a moody fella. First he stashes his soon-to-be-victims away in his cellar (where they can have time to hatch escape plans, and practice some more screaming) and then quite whimsically he remembers that he's got'm all sweaty and waiting down there so he picks up his chainsaw and down he goes chopping up half the staircase in the process. Sounds like a parody? Yes, but the problem is it was not intended to be, or if it was, it stayed a well hidden secret from the movie creators.<p>- The bizzaro-murdero-caniballo hillbilly family is so funny that it adds more howling laughter to be had and spoils whatever dim hopes this film had to be even remotely "scary". I know, it sounds like an intended parody again. Well, as i said above, it wasnt supposed to be.<p>- The good guys, composed obligatorily of 2 categories: the babes, and the hunks, falls into one of the most horrendous cliches of bad horror films. That would be that according to such films the victims are always future catwalk stars. They are also (perhaps again obligatorily) surrealy dumb. Maybe this is supposed to kick some sense of justice into us as they become anatomy experiments by the chainsaw-wielding psycho? I don't know, but i have some notions about that...<p>- The script, is, well, what script? To paraphrase a famous adage, the first casualty of a bad movie is the script. In this one here, the script is given to the chainsaw-psycho for practice BEFORE the movie gets filmed. It's all downhill from there.<p>All in all, as remakes are rapidly becoming Hollywood's way of bailing itself out of a dire need for scripts, we're having a sad phenomenon where perfectly good movies are butchered in the search for mo'bucks. Younger audiences might not be as offended as older ones but the result is nevertheless poor, really poor.<p>Acceptable for a night when you're snowed out and have a serious case of the flu to take care of, otherwise check out the original.</p></body></html>

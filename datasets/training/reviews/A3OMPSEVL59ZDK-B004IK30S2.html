<meta name="summary" content="Anchorman: The Arrogance of an entire cast"></head><body><p>This film was terribly unfunny. It tried way too hard. It had absolutely no plot or any kind of motivation for any of the characters. The supporting cast was extremely dull and uninspired. Will Ferrell was on auto-pilot, playing a pompous uncharismatic lead character, who gives us no reason to root for him or like him at all. Christina applegate was terrible. It had some good moments, but over all it just wasn't funny enough. <p>Why does an audience of 2004, give a rats patoot about a woman becoming an anchorman? I know it takes place IN the 70's, but the audience of today doesn't care about those issues anymore. Yet the film used it for its only mild plot device. What a waste.<p>I can't believe this film actually has a script. Ron's team was so over the top. The sports guy was never funny. The guy from daily show, was a waste. Its too easy to throw in a character like that for cheap laughs. The last guy again, not one good joke.<p>I wanted more stories about the rival studios, and less of the crap of a 70's news station getting a female anchor for 90 damn minutes.</p></body></html>

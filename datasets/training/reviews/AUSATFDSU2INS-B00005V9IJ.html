A puzzled look.<br /><br />Four years stranded on an island can leave us with much more than sand in our skin.<br /><br />Four years can change our priorities.<br /><br />The everyday commodities can mean nothing compared to the safety of knowing when we will drink a glass of ice water.<br /><br />The necessity to relate to other people acquires a worthy value when, drowned in the deepest solitude, we start to talk to a volleyball.<br /><br />And those are some of the hard lessons Chuck Noland learns.<br /><br />Cast Away is a rather optimistic vision of how an ordinary man, obsessed with the clock, is forced to let go of the notion of time, physically and emotionally.<br /><br />Tom Hanks is Chuck, a Fedex systems analyst; expert in problem-solving, in connecting people; for him, every minute counts, time is worth everything. A clock is crucial to the success of every task<br /><br />And while his busy agenda keeps him in places like Russia, Asia or Paris, in Memphis his girlfriend Kelly waits for him.<br /><br />One Christmas eve, Chuck has to go away again, leaving Kelly with the words "I'll be right back" floating in the air.<br /><br />Life can be full of such ironies.<br /><br />So, instead of coming back, Chuck's plane crashes and leaves him stranded on a desert island for four years.<br /><br />Four years where surviving is the challenge. Learn to fish, to open a coconut, find a shelter, lit a fire, fight nature.<br /><br />And then after overcoming all obstacles, what matters is live. So Chuck starts a rebirthing: talks to a volleyball, which he calls Wilson, and it's a sort of conscience to confide all his fears, frustrations and desires.<br /><br />Finally, all the conditions are given for the survivor to return to civilization.<br /><br />To a world that moved on, where time didn't stop, a world out of sync with Chuck.<br /><br />Cast Away is brilliant showing us how irreversible is the past and how marked we are with our experiences.<br /><br />Director Robert Zemeckis displays Chuck's life changes with a clean and simple technique. Overwhelming and busy at first, slow and full of silences during his isolation, reflexive and enigmatic at the end.<br /><br />Hanks proves his effectiveness carrying the entire movie in his shoulders. Frenetic and exhausting when we meet him, he transmits his busy way of life. And he is equally persuasive and convincing when he goes to that exceptional situation, sympathetic and also worthy of compassion.<br /><br />Chucks' spiritual changes are as obvious as his physical changes. He disconnects from reality and after four years, he loses that spark that shines in our eyes, result from our everyday contact with others.<br /><br />And once his hope to return to his loved ones is given to him, how difficult is to find that you don't fit anymore in that life. What can one do?<br /><br />Smile and look the possibilities the road offers you.</p></body></html>

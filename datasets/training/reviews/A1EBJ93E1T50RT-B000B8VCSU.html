<meta name="summary" content="8 days on the 8 Mile"></head><body><p>I have to admit I didn't even know who Eminem was until "The Marshall Mathers LP" came out in the summer of 2000.  When I first heard "The Real Slim Shady" on the radio that summer, I honestly thought it was some kind of practical joke.  Could anyone's voice really be that nasal?<p>Of course, the joke was on me.  The joke's on everyone when it comes to Eminem.  The morning that "8 Mile" came out, I heard two radio hosts in New York City (a right-wing social crusader, and a left-wing civil rights lawyer) debating Eminem.  One host decried Eminem, while the other lauded him, and it's not hard to figure out which host took which side.  Obviously, once I heard the debate phrased in those terms, I simply had to go see the film.<p>"8 Mile" is well worth owning on DVD -- if nothing else, for those of us less than fluent in hip-hop, the English subtitles make the movie remarkably easier to understand.  In the theater, the film was inspirational, without being hokey.  It stands up to repeated viewings, which is the mark of a truly good film.  Director Curtis Hanson has made increasingly solid movies throughout his career (his early "The Little Dragons" was banned to the purgatory of monthly airings on the Lifetime Network in the late '80s; now he's an Oscar winner) and in "8 Mile" he pushes all the right buttons without ever producing anything phony.<p>The magic element that makes "8 Mile" hang together is Eminem... of course.  Rabbit's an anti-hero, who picks a fight every ten minutes and loses most of them.  His film romance (with Brittany Murphy) is limited to an erotic encounter in an auto-stamping factory; the would-be couple's romantic gesture involves the middle finger.  If you're expecting "8 Mile" to conclude with a triumphant record deal and a marriage proposal, you're in the wrong theater.<p>The supporting cast in "8" mile is also notable.  Mekhi Phifer, who first came to my attention with an explosive recurring role on the penultimate season of "Homicide", is outstanding as Rabbit's hip-hop mentor and would-be sponsor.  Someone named Evan Jones is quite likeable as "Cheddar Bob", quite possibly the dumbest sidekick to appear in a movie since Steve Buscemi in "The Big Lebowski".  Sample exchange: "I need some privacy." "Can I come with you?".  The third notable character is Detroit itself.  Here's one of the bleakest movie landscapes ever, and it's all filmed "entirely on location in the 313", as the film's credits tell us.<p>The extras are a little weak.  The "making of" featurette runs just 10 minutes and doesn't seem to involve any original contribution by Eminem himself.  Well done, however, is the music soundtrack options, which all you to jump directly to the scene in the movie in which a particular song appears.  You can also watch the film's excellent freestyle battles this way.<p>The finest feature on the disc is a behind-the-scenes look at the filming of the freestyle battles.  Here we see the "American Idol"-style selection process of four extras who'll get to actually battle Eminem in the movie.  The feature is all the more  riveting for the fact that this sequence didn't make the final cut.  This feature is the closest that the "8 Mile" DVD comes to actually penetrating Eminem's barriers and getting a look at the real man himself.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Hyped sequel delivers"></head><body><p>After the acclaimed 'Silence Of The Lambs', a sequel was almost inevitable.  When it was finally disclosed that there would be, there was much speculation on who exactly would get the role - it seemed to be between Gillian Anderson and Julianne Moore.  Whilst Anderson may have been the more obvious choice, her role as Scully in leading TV series 'The X-Files' actually being based on that of Clarice Starling, Julianne Moore is fantastic.  Where Jodie Foster turned down the role for the movie being too graphic (she's right), Moore makes the most out of a very different character.  Whereas 'The Silence Of The Lambs' depended on Clarice and Hannibal's interaction, a few years down the line we've got a much more subdued, hardened Clarice that spends most of her time in the basement of the F.B.I (again with the Scully links).  When she actually does meet Lectre, it's utterly mesmerising - this down to great performances on both sides.<p>As for Hannibal's character, it's become a little camp with phrases such as 'goodie goodie' and 'okey dokie' that are nowhere near as unnerving as the director obviously intended them to be.  It is unfortunate that when the audience is treated to old tapes of some of Hannibal's most famous quotes from the previous film, that we get to realise that the character is just not as good.<p>Disregarding this though, it's very competent and managed to evade being pulled apart by the critics.  Ridley Scott also gets rid of, or lessens the role of, several characters in the book such as Margot and Barney that played out an interesting subplot in the book.  There are some scenes from Thomas Harris' novel that doubtless people wanted to see, such as Verger's disembowlment by a huge conger eel, but these are cut.  Although this may upset some fans, in the long run it works and cuts the long book down a great deal without taking from the main story.<p>Still, looking back, 'Silence Of The Lambs' was so much better.</p></body></html>

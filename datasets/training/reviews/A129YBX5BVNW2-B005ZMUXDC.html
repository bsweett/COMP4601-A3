<meta name="summary" content=""Disney Grows Its Hair Long And Regains A Long Lost Crown...""></head><body><p>Just finished watching "Tangled" on BLU RAY and it's everything other reviewers have said it is - and better.<br /><br />I suspect like many adults in their 50's, the last half-decent Disney we saw was "Beauty & The Beast" - and that seems like a very long time ago. Since then Disney has done some right saccarine pap, but this clever little beauty is back on track in a big way. Truly beautiful animation, great vocal work from the 3 principal leads, songs that are actually witty - characters you like and root for - and a very clever modern telling of an old tale. You can 'feel' John Lassiter's presence and heart all over it (Pixar)...and it's a genuine sensation to look at on BLU RAY (I believe the 3D version is even better).<br /><br />Very, very good indeed - well done to all involved.</p></body></html>

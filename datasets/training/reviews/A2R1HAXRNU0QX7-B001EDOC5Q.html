<meta name="summary" content="Improves from the first and provides real thrills."></head><body><p>As a child (probably over 30 years ago now), I read the CHRONICLES OF NARNIA every couple of years.  I loved the books, and at that time, they seemed like fast moving, exciting adventures to me.  Looking at them these days...they are charming but a little slow-paced for a modern audience.  I still highly recommend them as an introduction to epics for younger children (kids too young for LORD OF THE RINGS, for example)...but I also admit that they aren't exactly barn-burners.<br /><br />This was further borne out when I saw the made-for-TV British versions a few years ago.  While very faithful to the books...they moved at a glacial pace (and the special effects were pretty awful).  My kids couldn't get through them.<br /><br />So that's the main reason I so much appreciate the latest versions of these great stories.  Part 1, THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE was very faithful to the original...yet added some epic action sequences to jazz up modern audiences.  My biggest problem with that film was the sometimes poor special effects (I thought The Beavers were pretty badly done...to the point of distraction) and I thought James McAvoy was poorly cast as Mr. Tumnus...again a big distraction.  I thought the kids were very good, and Tilda Swinton was probably the perfect person for her role.  I liked the movie...but I didn't love it.<br /><br />I almost love PRINCE CASPIAN, though.  For one thing, it's nice to see another book in the series getting loving attention.  Second, the four young leads have really grown as performers.  (Although the young man playing Edmund has grown just a tiny bit too much...no fault of his.)  I particularly liked both of the young actresses.  Susan is truly a young woman you would NOT want to mess with in a fight...she's empowered but not the least bit showy about it.  And Lucy is perfect...we believe she is always the one who keeps one eye out for Aslan.<br /><br />The kids return to Narnia after one year back on our earth...and 1300 years have gone by.  Their old palace is in ruins, and they quickly discover that a race of humans called the Telmarines have driven the "magical" denizens of Narnia out of their own land.  The current leader of Narnia is so cruel, in fact, that he has driven his own nephew Caspian (and rightful heir) out of Narnia and into the woods.  There Caspian meets his destiny.<br /><br />PRINCE CASPIAN is populated with delightful creations.  The dwarves are a delight...Peter Dinklage is an actor of considerable gravity and subtlety...and gives a heartbreaking performance.  Reepicheep the Mouse appears and steals his scenes...just as he does in the book.  There are badgers, mighty Centaurs, fearsome Minotaurs, etc.  Most of them are rendered better than in the first movie, and there were only a few moments where the CGI wasn't quite up to the task.  For the most part, these creatures felt very much like physical presences.<br /><br />Naturally, the book's modest action scenes are greatly enhanced for the film.  While the ending battles are truly spectacular and actually quite exciting...I enjoyed the sneak attack on the Telmarine fortress almost as much.  Not only was it exciting...it had emotional resonance.  The great High King Peter and the up-and-comer Caspian both get taken down a peg or two...at a great cost.<br /><br />I hate to reveal any more plot...because most kids are far less familiar with this story than the first.  It isn't exactly a groundbreaking plot...but it's done very well and will engage kids and adults alike.  It is rated PG...but I almost think PG-13 would have been more appropriate...it is VERY violent, and lots of people die.<br /><br />There are some weaknesses, of course...Ben Barnes as Caspian needs some maturing.  He looks the part, and no doubt is quite a handsome young man...but his acting skills are not up to his fellow-young people.  Perhaps if he returns in a sequel...he'll add some gravitas.  Also, the movie is just a little slow going early on.  One or two scenes of voyaging or trudging through woods could easily have been eliminated.  Once the film kicks into high gear, though...it's pretty terrific.  The script itself is fairly faithful to the book and serves its purpose...but it's not transformative.<br /><br />By no means is this film the masterwork that THE LORD OF THE RINGS series was.  It has just a little childish edge to it...which is appropriate.  Nonetheless, I heartily recommend it.  If you liked the first film...you'll love this one.  If you were only so-so on the first film...I think you'll be pleasantly surprised at how this one grows.<br /><br />The best sign, to me, that I liked the film was that five minutes after it was over...I was very sad knowing it would be years before VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER comes.  I EAGERLY await that film...with its epic action sequences set at sea.</p></body></html>

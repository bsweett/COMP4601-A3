When crime has been happening thanks to gangster Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong), he orders a wet suit and decides to become a superhero named Kick-Ass. Although he has no superhero, he has metal plates in some parts of his skeleton and excellent fighting abilities with two clubs in his arms fighting whatever criminal and thug is out there. However, two of the city's well known superheroes such as Big-Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and assassin Hit-Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz) begin to make a comeback since Kick-Ass has became a pop culture phenomenon as they start to kill some crooks by themselves as well as have Kick-Ass join them. The don's son Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) becomes an anti-hero himself called Red Mist to lure the heroes into a deadly trap that can cost them their lives.<br /><br />Ultraviolent, hilarious and wild action-comedy based on the cult Marvel comic from Mark Millar! this one is basically like a satire on superheroes even on the very idea that what if superheroes existed in real life. The film has been controversial due to an 11 year old girl character killing people and cussing even though the actress is really in her young teens, i think this movie is a gory and relentless action packed bath of jokes and blood with ideas of course, this movie is a winner all the way.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray includes flawless picture perfect image quality and theatrical sound to it with great extras like Ass-Kicking Bonus-View, commentary, featurettes, art gallery and marketing. Disc 2 is the standard def DVD and disc 3 is a digital copy.<br /><br />Also recommended: "Superman Movies", "Batman Begins", "Dark Knight", "Watchmen", "Ichi The Killer", "Sin City", "Kill Bill 1 & 2", "Pulp Fiction", "Battle Royale", "Riki-Oh The Story of Ricky", "The Toxic Avenger", "Mystery Men", "Iron Man 1 & 2", "Superbad", "Pineapple Express", "Dick Tracy", "The Rocketeer", "Hellboy 1 & 2", "Ghostbusters 1 & 2", "Leon (a.k.a.

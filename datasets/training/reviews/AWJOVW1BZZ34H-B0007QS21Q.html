Great big budget action movie, decent story. Will Smith is good in this, he doesn't try to do too much. In some of his movies he becomes tiresome with his "always trying to be cute" personality, but they keep him in check in this one. The only downside to this story is there is no real victim, or somebody to feel sorry for, unless you count the poor misunderstood robot that only wants to help a cop that hates robots. Either way, worth seeing.</p></body></html>

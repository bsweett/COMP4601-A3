It reminded me alot of Richard Romanus' Heavy Metal, as Rodriguez tried to piece together several of Frank Miller's stories into one movie.  Still, I liked the look and feel of the movie, a deeply saturated black and white with spot colors.  It was interesting to see such actors as Mickey Rourke and Elijah Wood transformed beyond all recognition.  Clive Owen proved to be an inspired choice as Dwight, making a good contrast to Benecio del Toro's talking head.  But, in the end, this movie simply didn't add up.  It was more like a promotion for Frank Miller's serial graphic novels, which he continues to put out having gone beyond comic heros such as Batman and the Daredevil.  This isn't kids' stuff, but a series drenched in lurid sex and violence, which seems to be the staple of pulp fiction these days.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A terrific and high tension thriller!"></head><body><p>Around the genre of the gangsters there have been many interesting proposals. In this case we must recognize a very original treatment of the genre through audacious narrative ellipsis and a mesmerizing employment of the camera eye.<br /><br />Ben Kingsley and Morgan Freeman two legendary actors, in the role of the respective bosses give us a tour de force performance that join forces to an intrepid and fabulous script, that must be seen carefully through his puzzled construction. Arresting images and a memorable stage make of this picture a must-see. Unstoppable tension and solid argument that reminds us  Tarantino (Reservoir dogs) and Tony Scott (True romance).<br /><br />Don' t forget this young promising director.</p></body></html>

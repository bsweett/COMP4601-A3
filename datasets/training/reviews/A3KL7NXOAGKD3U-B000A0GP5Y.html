So much hype for a movie that should have been rated R....here is the breakdown for those that care about what they watch:<br /><br />At least 6 "N" words<br /><br />One f-bomb...yes the "f" bomb!!!<br /><br />Lots of "B's"....too many to count really<br /><br />Yes it is a prison movie...then it should be rated as such....I am dissapointed with the way that this film was handled in the rating boards eyes....<br /><br />I would not recommend this film to anyone under the age of 16...<br /><br />Where are the R's when you need them...what a let down!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Visually Stunning But Kind Of Muddled In Places...Glad I Rented It First!!"></head><body><p>This movie was not at all a bad movie...it was visually stunning,<br />utilizing great special effects throughout.<br />Saoirse Ronan captured the ill-fated Susie Salmon to a tee!<br />She exudes all of the sunlight of a cherub and brings forth<br />the uncertainty and self-absorption of being a 14-yr old girl<br />who is full of life, loves her family, and is beginning to have the<br />unmistakable pangs of her first love before she is brutally murdered<br />by her neighbor, played with reptilian cunning by Stanley Tucci!!<br />Tucci's cold calculating and deeply disturbed Mr. Harvey is by far<br />the break away performance of the film!<br />After Susie is murdered, she is caught between heaven and earth in a<br />beautiful purgatory-like netherworld where she can see her family as<br />they deal with the aftermath of her murder. Mark Wahlberg turns in a<br />very passionate performance as the father of Susie.<br />Susan Sarandon is great as the alcoholic eccentric hot mess of a grandmother,<br />who comes to live with her daughter and her family after the murder of Susie<br />to supposedly help them along, but she does more harm than good!---She's funny though.<br /><br />Michael Imperioli plays Lt. Fennerman, the detective who's assigned to solve<br />Susie Salmon's murder case, but is struggling because there isn't a whole<br />lot of evidence & viable leads, and forensic DNA profiling is still<br />30 yrs in the future. (-:<br />In the book, there are a lot more layers to this story and<br />Lt. Fennerman and Abigail, Susie's mother, even have an affair together.<br />Comforting each other...she in her pain over her daughter's murder,<br />and he, still grieving over the recent loss of his wife to illness.<br />Fennerman's character in the book is much more developed than in the movie.<br />Without going into a blow by blow detail of the movie, I'll just say that<br />I still found it to be interesting and entertaining.<br />It was just kind of muddled in some places, and they had to summarize<br />alot of the original story to make it work for Hollywood sensibilities.<br />I'm glad that I rented this movie first though...not to say that it's<br />not worth buying, but it ranked as just okay overall in my book....<br />Meaning it was interesting, entertaining, but not strong enough for me<br />to add it to my collection. Of course, that's just my humble opinion...<br />You can judge for yourself. (-:<br />P.S.>> I do like how Mr. Harvey gets his comeuppance in the end though!!</p></body></html>

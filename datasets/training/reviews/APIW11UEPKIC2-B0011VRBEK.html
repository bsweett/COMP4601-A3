<meta name="summary" content="I can only give the mvie a 3, but a 5 for the dvd release"></head><body><p>Now I enjoyed this movie very much.  But only up to a point.  I haev heard about these "tartan asia extreme:  Enough said, I don't exactly want to dwell on it.<br /><br />Now the story is VERY ineresting and had me wonderign all the way.  Now that was teh point of it, but it really went out of it's way to mget you interested in teh characters.  Teh whole revenge factro was just WAY too weird for me and then end is extreme .  It, well, no, I can't tell you,  you have to see it to believe it.  If you are into this kind of sick stuff, it is for you, but the second half of the movie just gets too "extreme" for me.  I will check out another one of these some time, but I give it one more chance.  Can anyone recomend a "tartan" action movie for me that is not so freakign extreme.  Good flick though, very good.<br /><br />Also the music kicked ass, but the music changes just like the movie does towards the end.  I may have gave this 3 stars, but being an action fan, I really enjoyed the realism as well as the unrealism in the fight scenes.  Yes he does use that hammer:)  The acting was BRILLIANT, story was good, but I only like my stomach turning over when I am watchign a horror. But last reviewr is right, camera angles and overall directorial job is just awesome.<br /><br />Commentary gives you all types of insight as the director and cinematographer focus mainly on the film and don't really get off topic.  They certianly wanted to talk about how they made it, some really good info on the  commentary.<br /><br />In the interview with the director he talks about the violence in his movies, how surprising.<br /><br />Other goodies iclude deleted sceens and trailers.<br /><br />Overall I have to say that the special features are superior to pretty much any other all region or region 1 asian dvd.  Well, I should say chinese, that's all I really know, but kno a lot.</p></body></html>

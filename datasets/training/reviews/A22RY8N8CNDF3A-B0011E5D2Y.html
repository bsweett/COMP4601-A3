<meta name="summary" content="Solid Comic Performances"></head><body><p>"Wedding Crashers" turned out to be fun and entertaining, although watch out for some raunchy guy banter and action.  It features two great performances by Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, who play a pair of divorce mediators.  They spend their spare time crashing weddings to enjoy good food and drink, and find the perfect woman looking for love, which, of course, ends in a series of one night stands.  Sure as every romantic comedy, one of them falls for someone already engaged.<br /><br />Vince plays his laid-back dude role, but Vince Vaughn is delightful in his part of the dynamic duo hunting for dames.<br /><br />Actually the two actors make a great pair, and bring a vibrant energy to the story.  It was a happy surprise to watch a well-done comedy.</p></body></html>

I was just amazed at what I was missing when I finally got the widescreen version of this movie.  They did an excellent job of bringing this film to DVD.  The sound is fantastic and the picture clarity is top notch. This movie is certainly one of the best movies out there.  As for people who say this movie slams the British and is historically inaccurate they're wrong.  One of the main advisors for this movie was General Bradley and it was almost lifted word for word out of his book.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great sports movie..."></head><body><p>Friday Night Lights is being billed as the best sports movie ever made.  That's a hard title to live up to.  The problem with sports films is that they - almost by necessity - follow the same arc; the tough coach who nobody supports comes in to a small-town team and leads them to the state finals.  Could be the plot of Hoosiers, right?<br /><br />What sets this film apart is that is based on true events.  Far from romanticizing the game, this movie makes the life of a high school football star seem like a nightmare.  It is too much of a responsibility to place on the shoulders of a 17-year-old to give meaning to an entire population's existence.  The director, Peter Berg, is an actor who is distinguishing himself with films like this and The Rundown.  He shows tremendous visual flare.  The movie has a documentary feel.  One of the great devices he uses is to have the constant talk radio chatter in the background; we know that the town's citizens feel that the problem with the local high school is that they "care too much about learnin'".<br /><br />I have never read the book, but I am told that the film is an accurate representation.  I am given to understand that they both capture what it is like for a small town sports star.  Even though it is hard to come up with new twists in sports movies, it does manage a few surprises.  It makes a fascinating and enjoyable movie.</p></body></html>

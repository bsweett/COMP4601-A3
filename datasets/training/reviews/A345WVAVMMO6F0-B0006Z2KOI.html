<meta name="summary" content="hasta la victoria siempre!"></head><body><p>this spanish language film accounts the early life of che guevara, and his tour thru south america while on vacation from medical school in argentina in the early 1950s. whatever one thinks of che, one cannot dispute the charisma. and gael garcia bernal (who is dreamy creamy, btw) evokes that on screen. the sequence in the leper colony can not help but get to you. and if the movie is a trifle overlong, im not sure what i would have omitted. worth anyones time.</p></body></html>

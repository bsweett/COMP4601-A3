<meta name="summary" content="A guilty pleasure"></head><body><p>Well, I have to admit that this movie looked very stupid and just terrible. It was very stupid but was, I have to admit, quite funny. It's completely out of control humor with a very stupid but funny plot. This movie for one had the most pot references EVER! (that I've seen) It had a lot of that stuff!<br /><br />The movie is about Harold and Kumar, two roomates, that are planning on having a night where they smoke mucho pot. Harold works hard and is mad because lots of work got dumped on him by his mean co workers. But, later he gets revenge on them! Kumar is the brilliant son of a doctor that doesn't really care that he's smart. They smoke some pot and decide to go to White Castle. But before, there's a hilarious add, showing the deadly consequences of marijuana, but there's so stoned that they jsut laugh at it. From then they invite their friends to go with them but there's busy watching the Gift, because they want to see Katie Holmes's boobs.<br /><br />They then go but get lost and encounter many crazy adventures and meet many whacko people along the way.<br /><br />If you're in the mood for just a really stupid comedy that's actually funny, this one's the one. Neil Patrick Harris costars and is really funny. Kumar's facial expressions are hilarious!<br /><br />Some of the people they encounter on the way are two bombshells with some "problems", a mean racist cop, a cheetah, a crazy guy named Freakshow, and more. The movie is stupid and has some unnecessary moments but gave me a lot of good laughs.</p></body></html>

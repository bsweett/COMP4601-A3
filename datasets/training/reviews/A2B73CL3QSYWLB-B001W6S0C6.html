I remember the anticipation and the dread it incurred from fans and non-fans alike.  The purists wanted it to go in the direction of it's comic book roots by going in a darker direction.  These acolytes loathed the 1960's TV series with a passion.  Jack Nicholson seemed the obvious choice to play the Joker.  Michael Keaton?  That light comedian as the Dark Knight?  And what of this young director, Tim Burton, who had two relatively successful films under his belt, "Pee Wee's Big Adventure" and Beetlejuice"?  Let's just say that this is not Adam West's Batman.  What is most striking to me is the macabre tone of the film and that it got such an overwhelming reception from the general audience($250 million in 1989 dollars).  Michael Keaton gives an interesting reading as Bruce Wayne/Batman, a kind of stoicism with personal demons bubbling under the surface.  Nicholson's performance is downright inspired with him just chewing the scenery as the mirthful homocidal performance artist.  Much was made of the look of the film, which won an Oscar for art director Anton Furst ("Full Metal Jacket").  The look of Gotham City can best be described as decaying industrial gothic.  Unlike alot of films nowadays, with the exception of the "Spiderman" films, character and story come first here and that's the reason "Batman" holds up so well.  The most recent entry in the "Batman" canon, "Batman Begins", is the only one that I can think of that compares favorably to this one.</p></body></html>

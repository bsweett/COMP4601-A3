<meta name="summary" content="It's Good, But I Personally Found The Ending Stupid"></head><body><p>Don't worry, I'm not going to spoil the ending for you but If I do with my ramblings then I apologise. The year is 1957 and a group of soviet soldiers break into a secret military base with an aged Indiana Jones. They want him to lead them to a box containing a mysterious mummified corpse which will help lead them to the powerful yet mysterious crystal skull. When they manage to locate the crystal skull and return it to its original resting place, unknown powers will be unleashed that if returned by the leading soviet lady Irina Spalko, it could mean a drastic turn in the cold war for the west.<br /><br />Now myself, like many others were doubtful that a fourth Indiana Jones film could work just as well as the originals. Not to sound ageist but the age of Harrison Ford was one of the main concerns when playing such a role. Literally from the first few scenes starting with the warehouse, my doubts were squashed. Harrison seemed on form with his action sequences, although I'm sure the stunt double played a particularly larger part in this instalment. Accompanying Indy on his missions this time around is a young, cocky, motorcycle riding 60s clich&eacute; called Mutt (LaBeouf). Don't worry though because this instalment isn't just starring one original cast member as an old Raiders of the Lost Ark love interest Marian Ravenwood comes back to reclaim Indy's heart. Oh and she's also Mutts mother, see the connection there?<br /><br />The action for this film is easily the best I've seen from any Indy film and that's including the classic boulder scene. Of course the CGI was destined to play a big part in a new Indy film and it really does. That doesn't take anything away from it, however, as the CG really is flawless and presents the environments with a genuine rapport to them.<br /><br />Overall it's a genuinely good film, the ending is a bit random and in some ways disappointing. It keeps the classic humorous moments in over the top situations, I have a genuine respect for Harrison Ford for what he's done in this film. He's shown that he can still hang with the young action stars of today and it definitely had its passing of the torch moment in relation to LaBeouf. I would recommend it to any film lover and wouldn't separate it from the entire Indy series as it's definitely kept the trend of being a satisfying action movie.</p></body></html>

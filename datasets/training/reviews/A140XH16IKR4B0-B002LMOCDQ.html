Maybe just a little bit, but you do. The Swedish group's music was a perfect complement to the 1970s disco era -- mindless, pleasure-oriented, saccharine and highly melodic. "Mamma Mia" stitches together ABBA's greatest hit (and a few more) into a fun and sometimes funny musical experience. The plot is silly and contrived -- a hippy girl's daughter is getting married and wants to invite her Dad to the nuptials. The singing -- done by the principals themselves, including Meryl Streep -- is mostly good, with the exception of poor Pierce Brosnan's forced efforts at song. The ABBA tunes more or less, kind of, almost fit the action. But the star of the movie, as far as I was concerned, was the terrific movement and lighting -- dancing, running, leaping glory bathed in Mediterranean light and Greek aesthetic. Cute story, fine music, but a delight for the eyes.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Damage From An Overambitious Attitude - Again"></head><body><p>I can't help comparing this movie with the story of another crazy girl who damages herself in her pursuit of perfection, an old story known as The Bell Jar.  There's one thing in this movie that I don't remember from The Bell Jar though that might explain the girl's overambition a bit better, and that is the driving force of the mother.  No wonder this poor ballerina went nuts.  She had an insane mother, an insane teacher, and an insane female dance partner (for lack of a better term).  The mother drove the ambition in the first place, the teacher purposely nourished it further and led to its distortion, and the dance partner fulfilled the distortion by feeding her the wrong messages.  It's really quite brilliantly weaved together for being as ugly as it is.<br /><br />The one way in which this really differs from The Bell Jar is the ending, but other than that, I can't point out too many major differences.  I wish I could remember the driving force that made the girl in The Bell Jar so unable to handle failure, but I just can't.  I think as I read the book, I simply assumed the driving force was just the societal pressures of the day to succeed academically (which is far worse now than it was in the 60's).  All I know is I got past my first truly epic failure years ago, so I shouldn't be in this sort of danger.  Hooray for EPIC FAIL!</p></body></html>

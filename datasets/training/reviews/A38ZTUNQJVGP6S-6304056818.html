<meta name="summary" content="Robby Robot Rules"></head><body><p>This movie is one hour and 38 minutes long and was released on March 15, 1956. Since this movie is based on Shakespeare's The Tempest, a book I never read, I cannot do a compare and contrast. In the movie, you can see some effects that Star Trek used in its television show. Basically the movie is set in the year 2200 and a group of soldies is sent to the planet Altair IV to find out what happen to a group of scientists who try to colonize the planet 20 years ago. Once the expedition reaches the planet reaches the planet the find the three remaining survivors. Robby The Robot, Dr. Edward Morbius, and Altaira "Alta" Morbius. Murders start turning up when an invsible creature start attacking the crew. The movie does have some laughs and tries to make a statement. I would recommend this movie to any. Just for the special effects alone.</p></body></html>

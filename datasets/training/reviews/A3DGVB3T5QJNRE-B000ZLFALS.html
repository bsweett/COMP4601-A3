Your timing could not of been better! You helped me to remember the fervor, passion and idealism that made up the mid-late 60's. It's been many years since I have burst out sobbing in a movie theater! Thanks for helping to lift the fog a bit! As an activist, you have collectively given me some badly needed renewed vigor!<br /><br />I also feel so very, very sorry for all the critics of this movie who don't have a clue about what  all this means, or whose hearts have grown so hard with such bitterness, cynicism or despair; or have just simply sold-out; or plain no longer care! All your ranting and raving and nay saying won't do a thing to take away one moment of  the adventure, creativity, experimentation, excitement or passion that made this time in history so great!<br /><br />I also what to thank the brilliant filmmakers for paying homage to so many important cultural icons, organizations and events of the period: Walter Cronkite, the greatest  broadcaster of the 20th century. Baba Olatunji, the Nigerian Drummer and social activist, his double looked like he came right off the Drums of Passion album cover! I can now see him smiling from heaven! The tremendous scene with Bread and Puppets, a living, breathing, direct link to 1960's radicalism, warmed my  heart! You even went up to their stronghold in Glover, Vermont, to film part of the scene! Bravo! The SDS (Students for a Democratic Society), which did not advocate violence, and the much smaller splinter-group that morphed into an organization advocating extreme measures, called the Weather Underground. The brave Martin Luther King, Jr. and his intervention in a labor dispute, which cost him his life. The historic occupation of  the Ivy League, Columbia University by its students protesting both the Vietnam war and the intense poverty that surrounded the school.  Ken Kesey and his legendary bus. The Jimi Hendrix & Janice Jopplin characters who show such dignity, and a passion for music. And, of course, the Beatles! Their music reaches deep into my soul. You gave me insights into the meaning of their tunes that after all these years never crossed my mind!<br /><br />I also enjoyed being bathed in all the very colorful special affects. The 60's and early 70's were a time of outrageously bold colors and design. Something brilliantly portrayed in Across the Universe! The only film I intend to purchase on DVD that has been released this year!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1931498199">Rehearsing With Gods: Photographs and Essays on the Bread & Puppet Theater</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0413605108">Bread and Puppet Theatre (Theater) - Volume 2</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0882861778">The New Radicals in the Multiversity and Other Sds Writings on Student Syndicalism (Sixties Series)</a>,  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006B1RI">Drums of Passion</a></p></body></html>

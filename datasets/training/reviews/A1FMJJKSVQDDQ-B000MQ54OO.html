<meta name="summary" content="*sigh* Again with penguins . . ."></head><body><p>So now we're having a deeper fascination with penguins. They're adorable, but this supposed trend is getting overrated. We've got animated films that contain talking penguins (no surprise there). We've got Surf's Up, Madagascar 1 & 2, and now this. Here we have Happy Feet, which is obviously a CGI family film. But what's wrong with it? Well, I can think of a few. First, it's very anti-religious. I'm an agnostic, and I found the overall message to the second half of the movie very insulting. It's like one of those worthless hypocritical messages that you see on The Church Channel; this is just as bad. Second, the songs are very out of place. Many of the songs contain sexual innuendo. I don't care what kids do (they can do whatever they want), but don't you think that this is a bit too much? And lastly, these penguins are so ANNOYING! Everything about them, from their voices to their dancing, is always on the top level of annoyance. But hey, this is still a family feature, and we all love dancing penguins, don't we?<br /><br />But there is still a plus side for Happy Feet. The animation is really impressive: Antarctica really looks beautiful here. But that's the only good thing about this family film. If you have kids, then watch it with them. You'll have a good time. Otherwise, try to avoid its anti-religious message, and its seemingly nonstop cuteness.</p></body></html>

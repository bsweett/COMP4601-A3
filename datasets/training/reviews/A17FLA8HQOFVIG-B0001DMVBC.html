<meta name="summary" content="I loved the book.  And I loved the film even more."></head><body><p>The theme of this story is one of constant contrasts.  Ben Kingsley stars as Behrani, an Iranian man living in California.  He was wealthy in Iran and he and his family escaped with their lives.  They've been in America a few years and the wealth they formerly had is fast being depleted.  Behrani works at two jobs - a laborer by day and a convenience store clerk by night.  He saves his money and buys a house at auction.  He thinks his troubles are over.  But they are just beginning.<p> <p>Jennifer Connolly is cast as Kathy, the young woman was evicted from the house that Behrani buys. She's been abandoned by her husband, works cleaning houses for a living, and just can't seem to keep her life together.  She's also a former drug addict who is easily tempted by alcohol.  Devastated by the eviction, she vows to get her house back.  This is a perfect formula for trouble.<p> <p>The acting is perfect.  And the direction and cinematography are excellent.  Some of the shots were able to show in a few seconds what it took pages and pages to bring out in the book.  It's an ultimately sad story and I remember how upset I was while reading the book.  But watching the film, I actually wept.  There's something about the media of film that could do that.  The book had more detail and background.  But ultimately, it's the story that touched my heart.<p> <p>Don't miss this film.  It's a tear-jerker, but it is great!</p></body></html>

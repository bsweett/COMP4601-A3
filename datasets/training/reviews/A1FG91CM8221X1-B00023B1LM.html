<meta name="summary" content="The Damon Identity changes--to action hero."></head><body><p>The Bourne Identity is a solid, efficient, old-fashioned thriller that gives us everything we could want in a summer shoot-'em-up. Robert Ludlum's ingenious original story--he made Jason Bourne COMPLETELY alone, hunted by the police and his own colleagues alike, without even memory to help him--is given swift, streamlined treatment by director Doug Liman, with plenty of explosions, assassinations, car chases and double-crosses to keep us on the edge of our seats. Matt Damon gives an assured, charismatic performance as Bourne, his weathered baby face giving the character a certain poignancy without detracting in the slightest from his credibility. He's nobody's male ingenue anymore! German actress Franka Potente lives up to her last name: she's a potent and sexy screen presence, not particularly pretty but far more alluring than many women who are. And it's interesting to see Chris Cooper, normally typecast as a nice guy, give such a thoroughly creepy performance as Bourne's treacherous CIA boss. I was disappointed to see Clive Owen wasted in a role beneath his talents, but the rest of the movie ticks away with the deadly efficiency of a Rolex watch attached to a time bomb.</p></body></html>

Well, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind main star may be billed as Jim Carrey, but it's true star is Michael Gondry, the director. This film is best described as an acid trip, a bad case of deja vu and a nightmare rolled into one. The story centers around the relationship between an introverted, lonely man Joel (Jim Carrey) and a spontaneous, vivacious extrovert named Clementine (Kate Winslet). They meet by chance and fall in love and then hit some hard times which leads the impulsive Clementine to have her memories of Joel erased by a company called Lacuna. Once Joel realizes this, he decides to have his memories of Clementine erased from his memory. Much of the duration of the film is spent as the doctor tries to erase Joel's memories of Clementine, while Joel realizes (as the process is going on) that he's made a big mistake. Joel and Clementine try to escape to a part of Joel's brain where they can't be detected so that Joel can keep his precious memories of her. Carrey gives a fantastic understated performance, while Winslet continues to impress with every role she takes. Eternal Sunshine does shine brightly because of the impeccable, flawless direction of Michael Gondry. Simply put, you have never seen another movie like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and you never will after it. This movie will resonate in your brain and haunt you...in a good way. A monumental achievement. Highest Recommendation.</p></body></html>

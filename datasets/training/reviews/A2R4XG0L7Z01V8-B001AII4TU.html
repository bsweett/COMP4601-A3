<meta name="summary" content="Worst one of the trilogy"></head><body><p>As someone very special pointed out, the Shrek movies are all about pop culture references, and spotting the celebrity voices, rather than watching it properly for a movie.<br /><br />I'm sure if I re-watched the first two movies, I would be ultimately as fed up of them as I am this one. They were good when they first come out, but the third was one too far I think.<br /><br />There's just nothing stand out about the movie. It's the same tired jokes, the same nonsense once again, and it's just got really old.<br /><br />Is it worthwhile seeing? No, it's not, only if you seriously LOVED the first two, but otherwise, put it down and walk away.</p></body></html>

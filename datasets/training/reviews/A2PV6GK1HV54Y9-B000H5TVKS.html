<meta name="summary" content="The return of Jigsaw."></head><body><p>Saw II with Donnie Wahlberg is a great and intriguing follow-up. Just as good as the orginial. At first, I had no interest in seeing the sequel but I am glad I did see it, the movie is only 90 minutes long and it goes by pretty darn fast, this movie keeps you on your toes to the end. Saw II has a great and surprise ending like the first one (didn't see it coming.)Defintely worth viewing, I tend to hate sequels but this one actually is amazing. I think Donnie Wahlberg is a better actor than his brother, who would of thought?</p></body></html>

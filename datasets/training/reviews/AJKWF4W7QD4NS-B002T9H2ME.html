In the realm of the science fiction film genre, many films usually occupy the sub-genre of alien invasions/contacts, interstellar travel, etc.  Now and then however, a few films will pop up in the genre that akin more to the kind of hard science fiction that 2001: A Space Odyssey pioneered years ago; films like The Fountain or Steven Soderbergh's remake of Solaris.  Moon falls into that category of hard science fiction, marking the feature film debut of director Duncan Jones, the son of David Bowie.  Sam Rockwell stars as Sam Bell, an astronaut on the way of coming to an end of a lonely three-year stint on the moon.  His only company is the robotic GERTY 3000 (voiced by Kevin Spacey), and needless to say, he's looking forward to reuniting with his wife and young daughter.  Things take a strange turn however when Sam starts seeing and hearing strange occurances, and then things really take a turn after he recovers from an accident and discovers that he isn't quite as alone as he thought he was, and things are definitely not what they seem.  I really don't want to give anything away here, but when things twist and turn with Moon, they manage to truly surprise the viewer.  The film presents some thought provoking moments, and while things don't always work out as well as they probably should (the film is quite slow moving), the end result is that Moon is a haunting, and surprisingly touching at times, science fiction film.  Rockwell is superb, and truly one of the most underrated actors working today.  Hopefully after Moon, and with his upcoming role in the high profile Iron Man II, he'll finally get the right kind of recognition that he wholeheartedly deserves.  All in all, give Moon a chance at the very least, regardless of what sorts of science ficiton films are your cup of tea.  You'll be pleasently surprised, as Moon is indeed a future cult classic.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="FLAWLESS MASTERPIECE even though changes were made from the comics!"></head><body><p>Similar to what Alien did to the Sci-Fi thriller genre, the film X-Men was a milestone in re-introducing the comic genre to the general public. The last blockbuster movie based on a comic before X-Men was the Batman with Mr. Freeze, and I think it's safe to say we would all like to forget that one.<br /><br />When I first watched X-men over a decade ago, I remember not being over-zealous or joyed over the plot, characters, acting. After watching it over and over again throughout the years, I've realized the intangible greatness that lies in the film. It laid the blue-print for how to introduce an ensemble super-hero cast. Truly one of those films that you appreciate more and more every-time you watch it.<br /><br />What Singer does well is give the film a feeling grounded in reality. His "Star Trek" approach to X-men is unique and the cinematography of the film is beautiful. I love the openings of the film with magneto and rogue. I feel that everyone got a decent amount of time on screen and the performances from xaiver and magento couldn't have been better. They were brilliant. and even thought they made a lot of changes to the rogue character, the way she ties in to magento's plot and the bond her and wolverine make and how he saves her was very touching. and i love the soundtrack as well, the rogue/wolverine theme was brilliant.  i like how this movie wasn't all about action but about the actor's performances. everyone did a great job. This movie really captures what x-men are all about and despite the changes they made to rogue and the unexplored past of some characters (for budget and running time reasons obviously) this is in my top 5 comic films of all time. a true sci-fi masterpiece.

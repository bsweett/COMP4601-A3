<meta name="summary" content="some will like it and some won't"></head><body><p>i spent many years watching foreign films in art houses.  i got hooked on the authenticity of seeing a film in its natural setting and in its own language.  i barely registered after awhile that i was reading subtitles. thus, when this hugely successful swedish novel was made into a swedish film, i loved it.  i loved the novel and its sequels too. surprisingly, many americans who don't usually like subtitled films, loved it too, i just assumed no one would be interested in remaking a rather perfect experience.  i was wrong.  we remade it in our languaage, set it in sweden but had the actors speak english.  some of these actors adopted swedish accents for, ahem, authenticity. on the plus side, at least a first rate director, david fincher, was at the helm.<br /><br />it is a good film.  how much you like it will depend on whether you've seen the swedish film. the swedish film was the novel brought to life.  the american film isn't simply because it is american. however, if you hate subtitles, don't like foreign films much and in general like american remakes of foreign films, then this is the version for you.<br /><br />here's the plot: a wealthy industrialist wants the murder of Harriet, a young relative missing for decades and presumed dead., finally solved.  he perceives a disgraced journalist as his best bet as a detective.  he makes him an offer too ample to refuse and we are off and running. as our amateur detective keeps digging, it appears that a serial killer is involved. joining him in this investigation is lisabeth salander.  she takes over the movie just as she took over the book and swedish film.  she is a very complex young woman with staggering computer abilities. she also has some staggering problems which begin to unfold. the young woman playing her in the film is outstanding,  i can't decide which actress i like best in her role.  we all know daniel craig is a great actor but he doesn't even come close to what this actress pulls off in this film. she even makes me believe she is swedish, which craig never does.</p></body></html>

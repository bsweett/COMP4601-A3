<meta name="summary" content="Stoned in Persia"></head><body><p>This Director's Cut DVD rates its three stars because Oliver Stone is incapable of being non-controversial, it's an epic view of an epic life, it's a full nine minutes shorter than the original (truly), and because so many wrong-headed reviews have appeared here and elsewhere that it qualifies as victim or  underdog, either of which earns some sympathy. Otherwise, "Alexander" might be starless, not for its askewed history or card-shuffle editing but for the wasted opportunity it represents.<br /><br />Baz Lurhman, the Austrailan director, is planning his own take on Alexander with Leonardo DiCaprio. It can only be better. Last year's "Troy," for that matter, was better, even though it turned the legendary anger of Achilles into petulance and his male lover into a cousin (Stone gets credit for not dodging that issue.)<br /><br />Colin Farrell as Alexander and Angelina Jolie as his scheming mother are pretty but clearly miscast. Val Kilmer fares better as his rabid father but the script undermines him, as it does everyone. Robin Lane Fox, the definitive biographer of Alexander, was a consultant, but Stone must have stoned him. Two combat sequences, one featuring an eagle's overview and the other costumed elephants, are edited so ineptly it's hard to know what's happening, which doesn't much matter because Alexander never lost a battle. Anthony Hopkins' on and off-screen narration throughout helps somewhat.<br /><br />For this two-disc DVD, Stone says he cut some of the "gayness" over which critics and homophobes have chortled. In fact, in his original there was nothing overt, just the suggestion that Alexander was bisexual, as was customary at the time. Even that little was too much for some; others complained it wasn't enough. Unless you show naked people fornicating, filmmakers are accused of avoiding human sexuality. Cameras used to pan away and scenes dissolve after the first kiss. Not any more; today the actors are just getting started.<br /><br />Subtlety is usually a stranger to Stone, but the very idiosyncracies that favor this director go against him here. Farrell and his pals have lilting Irish accents, Jolie utters (there's no other word for her speech) an ersatz Balkan, Kilmer barks Americanese, and everyone else speaks brittle British. When Alexander enters Babylon, you half expect to encounter the Tower of Babel.<br /><br />What could this bold and, yes, exciting director have been thinking to tackle a subject of such complexity and magnitude? Ancient history is far from the contemporary terrain he walks so well ("Wall Street," "JFK," the Vietnam trilogy). Stone is never going to conquer his known world if he spears another spectacular dud like this one.</p></body></html>

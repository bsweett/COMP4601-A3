<meta name="summary" content="Corpse Bride"></head><body><p>Victor Van Dort (depp) is arranged to be married to Victoria Everglott (Watson), a woman he has never met.  Her family is upper class, but broke.  His family have recently come into money through the fish business.  This marriage will save Victoria's family and keep them solvent.  Fortunately, when Victor and Victoria meet, it is love at first sight.  Unfortunately, the wedding rehearsal goes poorly, with Victor forgetting his lines.  While practicing his vows later in the forest, he accidentally places the ring on the skeletal finger of Emily (Carter), the Corpse Bride.  She brings him to the underworld to meet her parents and friends.  Meanwhile, in Victor's absence, Victoria's parents plot to marry her off to Barkis Bittern (Grant).<br /><br />"Corpse Bride" looks amazing.  Stop-motion animation comes seamlessly to life and makes the characters alive.  Tim Burton's "regulars" voice all the characters and all do a good job.  The main problem, for me, was that the movie felt too long, even at only 78 minutes.  While the animation is neat to see at first, it loses something after a while and ceases to be a novelty.  "Corpse Bride" is definately for fans of Tim Burton or this kind of animation.  Others may be less satisfied with it.</p></body></html>

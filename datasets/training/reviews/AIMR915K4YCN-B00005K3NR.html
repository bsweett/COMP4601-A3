<meta name="summary" content="Loved The Book AND The Movie!"></head><body><p>This is one of like 3 or 4 screen adaptations of Stephen King novels I can tolerate. I consider this to be the best. Sissy Spacek IS Carrie White! Piper Laurie IS her crazy mother! They shine in this classic battle between kids and parents, cultural norms vs. religious fanaticism, and knowledge vs. ignorance. Carrie is growing up. She experiences her first period and is humiliated by her entire gym class (who "stone" her with pads), due to the fact that her psycho-preacher mom  never explained the simple facts of life to her. Such things are far too "sinful" to even mention. Well, along with puberty comes a power that enables Carrie to move things with her mind. Slowly, we realize that this power is awesome and dangerous. This is not so much a spook show about telekinesis, as it is a tragedy. Most people know the story about the prom, the pig's blood, Mom's kitchen crucificion, etc. In the book, Carrie personified the awkwardness and misery suffered by the "outsider" in teen life. Sissy Spacek made the role her own. The intensity of her eyes during the final holocaust is incredible! Brian DePalma handled the direction with honesty, humor, and complete terror. An impressive film. Bonus- Check out the young John Travolta and Nancy Allen as the king and queen of slime! Amy Irving is great too! Also, see P.J. Soles (Halloween) in a funny hat! ...</p></body></html>

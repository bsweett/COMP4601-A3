Produced by Michael Bay and starring Jessica Biel, the film is about a group of young people who come across an abandoned house in the backroads of Texas. What happens to them is unimaginable and the horror and fear they go through is something that has never been put on film before. This remake is based on the classsic 1974 horror film. However this remake outshines the original because of the outstanding production values and amazing performances by the leads. R. Lee Ermey steals the film as a so-called sherrif who inflicts tortue and hell on the innocent youngsters.<br /> This DVD two disc set is breathtaking as the studio painstakingly took the time in producing it. The DVD set opens up like a mini chainsaw and there is an actual tin card featuring the movie poster art. The bonuses are endless with interviews, commentaries, deleted scenes, and trailers, plus much more.<br /> "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre-2003" would go on to be a huge boxoffice smash and ultimately more remakes of classic 1970's horror films would be produced.</p></body></html>

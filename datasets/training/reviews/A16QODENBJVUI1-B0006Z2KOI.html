<meta name="summary" content=""On the Road" with Che Guevara"></head><body><p>As most potential viewers know, this film is based on diaries and letters to home written by Ernesto "Che" Guevara during a motorcycle and foot tour of a significant portion of South America during the early 1950s, years before Guevara achieved international renown as a Communist and Latino revolutionary.  Thus, the film functions as an attempt to get at the heart of the person who preceded the myth.  The film is therefore difficult to judge as pure cinema.  Is this, on its own merits, a great film?  Or is it a great film about Che Guevara?  Interestingly, the person I saw this film with knew absolutely nothing about the subject of the film before it started, and did not connect Ernesto Guevara with Che Guevara until very late in the film.  Her reaction was interesting.  Until she realized that it was about Che, she says that she considered it a decent but only slightly above average "road" picture, but it gained considerably in her estimation once she realized who the film was about.  I think she was correct, and I would agree with those who feel that what merits the film has depends to some degree on who the film is about.  If Ernesto hadn't become Che, it would be a good film but of considerably less interest than it is.<br /><br />The film does a good job of rooting Che's eventual concern with the liberation of the oppressed by depicting his broad and constant encounters with everyday people throughout the continent.  Camus wrote that it was important to side with the victims and not the executioners, and in his travels Ernesto spends most of his time with the victims.  His near-epic exposure to the continent clearly condition his sympathies and inform his vision.  At the end of the film it is easy to understand why Che chose a life dedicated to aiding the oppressed in Cuba and elsewhere.  The great question left unanswered, and the one reason one can find Che's life morally troubling, is why he felt that the causes he espoused demanded a violent, military response.  Why follow in the steps of Trotsky and Lenin rather than Gandhi?  Apart from a single line which merely hints that Che felt violence might be necessary, the film doesn't come anywhere close to answering this question.<br /><br />In many ways, the star of the film is the South American continent.  I have seen many films over the years set in one corner of the continent or another, but none provided a panoramic view.  This film, however, by swinging through Argentina, Chile, Peru, Columbia, and Venezuela provides a graphic impression of the continent's immense geographical diversity, expanse, and enormous beautiful.  I don't think it would be possible to see this film without a deep urge to visit the land.  The scene shot in Machu Picchu reveals the incredible beauty of the site better than anything else I have ever seen.<br /><br />Gael Garcia Bernal is a remarkably handsome, talented young actor, formerly best known for one of the two young men in Y TU MAMA TAMBIEN, and is outstanding in portraying the young Che Guevara.  One suspects that his days as an actor in primarily Latin productions is close to an end, his next several projects originating in Hollywood.  Rodrigo De la Serna does not have the enormous charisma of Bernal, but he more than holds his own in the film.  The cast is rounded out by a large roster of professional and amateur performers.<br /><br />Che Guevara is such a controversial figure that this film could elicit a host of differing responses.  How one will respond to this film will be deeply conditioned by how one views him.  But I do think that it is a film that virtually every viewer will respond to with great interest, and I defy anyone not to find the remarkable landscapes anything short of stunning.</p></body></html>

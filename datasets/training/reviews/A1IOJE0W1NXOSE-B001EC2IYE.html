It started out like many sports movies with a young, unknown athlete (in this case Hillary Swank) who decides that her whole life will be dedicated to winning a championship in her sport.  Her mentor (Clint Eastwood) is a crusty old curmudgeon who keeps telling her that he doesn't coach girls.  When his best fighter leaves him, however, he finds himself with time on his hands and frustration in his heart, and he agrees to train her.  I did not expect the dark turn that the movie takes and I'm not sure what point is being made by the crisis situation.  On the positive side, the characters are real and believable.  It is the situations in which they find themselves that strains credibility.  Morgan Freeman is still able to put his indelible stamp on any movie in which he appears, and I was grateful for his soothing presence amidst the tragedy of the film.</p></body></html>

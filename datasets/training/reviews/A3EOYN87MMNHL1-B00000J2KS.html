Those of you of a certain age know what happens to eight-track tapes--they eventually start double-tracking, or the tape player eats them.  Precision splicing will give them a few more month's play time which I attempted in desperation. I always had it in the back of my head to get a copy of the movie, and I did, and viewed it a few month's back.  Malcolm McDowell is perfect as is the sound-track a perfect accompaniment. The costuming is FAB. Although the sets, which seemed ultra-futuristic at the time seem retro- Seventies now, it is still a great movie--I think Kubrick's best.</p></body></html>

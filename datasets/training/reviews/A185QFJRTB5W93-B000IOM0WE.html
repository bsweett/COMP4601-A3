<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly Good Sci-Fi . . ."></head><body><p>I went into this film with extremely low expectations.  I used to watch the animated Aeon Flux series which was very well done, if not somewhat confusing.  Bringing Aeon Flux to the big screen actually IMPROVES upon the original.  The film fleshes out the the story/history of Aeon Flux and actually makes the entire premise understandable.  This film was an enjoyable ride with some interesting special effects, some were good, some were lacking (I found all the blood in the film very fake).  Overall, this film is a good watch for anyone interested in sci-fi (even if not totally original).  The film stands on its own without any viewing of the animated series.  Four stars = above average.  Aeon Flux gets a well deserved four stars.</p></body></html>

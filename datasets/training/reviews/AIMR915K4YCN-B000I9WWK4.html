Kurt Russell is cast in the role of his career (yes, better than his role as escape from new york's "Snake") as Macready, a no-nonsense helicopter pilot with an arctic research group. The opening scene shows an alien craft crash-landing on earth in some distant past. The next scene is the eerie "doghunt", where the world's weirdest husky is saved from it's norwegian (scientists from another research facilty a few miles away) pursuers by our unsuspecting heroes. Of course, the poor doggy is taken back to the base, where bizarre things begin to happen right away. It seems that our canine friend was not a dog at all, but an extraterrestrial entity with the ability to attack, assimilate, and assume the identity of any living creature. Like a monster virus, it jumps from person to person, becoming an almost perfect copy of it's now dead victim. Put this together with the fact that this takes place in a totally isolated location, and you've got the best paranoid nightmare ever filmed! The tension, suspicion, and terror are palpable (In fact, aside from the arctic setting, THE THING has more in common with INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS than it does with the original classic film THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD). The alien transformation scenes are as awesome as they are disgusting. This is John Carpenter's magnum opus of slithery goo! THE THING is a downright disturbing frightfest. Even Wilford Brimley is scary! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED...</p></body></html>

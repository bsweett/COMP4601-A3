<meta name="summary" content="Springtime for Idi Amin"></head><body><p>In The Last King of Scotland, Forest Whittaker won an Oscar for this portrayal of Ugandan dictator, Idi Amin. Forest has a slight asymmetry to his face, where his eyes don't quite match, and while Idi Amin didn't possess this facial quality, Whittaker made good use of it for a "crazy eyes" effect. Soon you totally accept him as Idi Amin, you can't see the Forest for the Idi, you might say. He has a great accent, too, speaking with a British accent, reflecting his time in the British Army, since Uganda was a British colony up until 1962. What made the Oscar people take notice, I think, was how he was able to capture the mad dictator's charisma, the sweet and seductive charm, and then gradually reveal the terror of what was happening in Uganda.<br /><br />In interviews with the actor and director Kevin Macdonald included with the DVD they talk about how they didn't want to demonize Idi Amin. It is not exactly Springtime for Hitler, but it does show another side of him. He is ultimately revealed as a monster, but he was also a charismatic leader who did a lot of good for his country and people--when he wasn't killing them.<br /><br />The screenplay was based on a novel by Giles Foden. The story is told through the eyes of a totally fictional character, Scottish doctor Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy). He is a strange looking man, and one of the opening scenes shows him screaming, as if having a nightmare, and he looks positively wraith-like. Not sure if this was supposed to be foreshadowing of the horror to come, or if he was just screaming out of boredom. Wanting to get out of his hum drum life and have some adventure. Once he gets to Uganda and becomes Idi Amin's personal physician, he proves an excellent foil for the dictator, and provides an interesting perspective to tell the tale. Whittaker has a way of calling his name, "Nicholas, Nicholas" that is sweetly sing songy, but becomes increasingly disturbing as the terror ratchets up.<br /><br />Alex Heffes composed music for the soundtrack, that is mostly good to adequate, but the best part of the soundtrack is the different African songs used. They really convey the excitement, vitality, and promise of an old country struggling to come into the modern world. Toko Momo by Wandel, Nakawunde by Percussion Discussion Africa, Afro Disco Beat by Tony Allen, Save Me E. T. by Mensah & The Tempos Band, Grazing in the Grass by Hugh Masekela, Kasongo by Afrigo Band, Fever by Jingo, Bukom Mashie Mashie by Oscar Sulley & The Uhuru Dance Band, Love Is You by Ofo The Black Company, and Acholi Pot Song by Ndere Dance Troupe really contribute to the excitement of this fine film. There are even a few songs done African style that speak volumes about Uganda's colonial past: Me and Bobby McGee by Angela Kalule and The Bonnie Banks O' Loch Lomond by Nyzonza Singers.</p></body></html>

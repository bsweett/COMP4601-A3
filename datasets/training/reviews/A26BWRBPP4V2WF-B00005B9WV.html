We follow two aging experts - one male, one female - as they try to find a quiet life for themselves together.  Unfortunately, their old nemesis reappears with an apprentice.  The apprentice has stolen the master's legendary sword and has taught herself (from a stolen manual) the secrets of the Wudan, the martial arts society that is the pinnacle of skill, instructing its students in the art of swordplay, unarmed combat, and "flying."<p>The film is visually spectacular.  The scenery of the desert, the bamboo forest, and a recreated 18 century Beijing are all beautifully filmed and provide an epic backdrop.  The fight scenes are also beautiful to behold, well-choreographed, exciting, and oddly realistic, considering the belligerents can defy gravity at will.  The soundtrack, with its staccato drums to emphasize the action and haunting cello meoldies (by Yo Yo Ma), is a perfect accompaniment for the images.<p>Unfortunately, the story itself does not hold up the sections between the fight sequences.  Usually this is not a problem with martial arts movies, as the plot is secondary.  However, in this film more time is spent in exposition than fighting, so we must assume the plot was meant to be important.  There are two glaring problems (for me) that detract from the enjoyment of the film.  The first is the nature of the "main" character, the apprentice evil-doer.  The screenplay seems to keep changing its mind - is she the rogue with a heart of gold or a selfish brat that deserves what she gets?  We are left wondering why the old master keeps forgiving her faults, and how she could have made the brigand chief fall in love with her.  Secondly, there is the problem of a 20-minute flashback sequence explaining the love between the apprentice and the brigand chief.  It comes out of nowhere half-way into the film and disrupts the whole flow.  Surely the script should have been reworked to ease into this subplot; as it is, it seems forced on us and we resent it.<p>It's entirely possible that a native Mandarin speaker would not agree with my criticisms.  I know when I watch English movies subtitled in French (or vice versa), the subtlties and nuances do not always translate well, and I'm sure it would be worse crossing a cultural barrier from Euro-American to Chinese.  However, Lee's own "Eat Drink Man Woman" was wonderful and had the same potential issue, so I have to think the subtitles are not totally to blame and the fault lies in the script.<p>The commentary on this DVD is quite fun to listen to.  There are tidbits of information that explain why and how the film was made and explaining scenes.  There are also some funny moments, where Schamus is pointing out "cheesey shots."  There's also a making-of featurette that is interesting, showing how the stunts were performed with wires.  However, the commentary is the jewel of the DVD edition, aside from the superior sound and video quality that is inherent to the format.<p>Overall, I enjoyed the film, and can see why it was so successful.  However, I was disappointed by the inconsistencies with the apprentice character and the plotting in general, which lowered the film's rating.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Unnecessarily Sad"></head><body><p>This movie broke my heart - between the unexpecting employees being fired to the major disappointment with the main character and his love interest -- really a very sad film.<br /><br />However, with the economy continuing to collapse and the unemployment rate going up, this is a movie for its times.  Great acting and a good story make this a must see film.</p></body></html>

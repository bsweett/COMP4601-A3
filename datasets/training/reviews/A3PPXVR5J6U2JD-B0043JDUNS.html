<meta name="summary" content="More Iron, Less Man"></head><body><p>The sequel to Iron Man promised to be an entirely different movie because it took the standard trope - playboy superhero trying to lead a double life - and turned it on its ear by having Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) revealing his secret identity to the world. Iron Man is the Batman of the Marvel universe, so you can imagine the implications of a billionaire with an arsenal of firepower at his fingertips.  The government, for one, is extremely nervous about a private enterprise waging wars in foreign countries - a topical concern in today's world of "security firms" operating in America's wars. Shareholders, for another, fret that the often intoxicated Stark is such a warped genius that he will self-destruct ala Charlie Sheen.<br /><br />Iron Man 2 is further complicated by aggrieved Russian scientist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) codenamed Whiplash, who teams up with Steve Jobs-like Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), a second stringer defense contractor.  To make matters worse, Stark's palladium core - the miniature reactor in his chest - is poisoning him.  The world has it out for Mr. Stark.<br /><br />There are several plot points that Iron Man 2 struggles to juggle simultaneously: the leadership of Stark Industries, the government's demands for the Iron Man plans, Stark's romance with his personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), his past relationship with his deceased father (a genius in the Walt Disney mold who built his own World's Fair-like Stark Expo), his looming death, his battle with alcoholism, and his rivalry with a competitor (Hammer) and the son of the original developer of a similar suit (Vanko).  And oh yeah, there's a little matter of the Avengers trying Stark out for membership.<br /><br />There's so much going on that inevitably some of these plot points suffer.  Stark's romance with Potts is more implied than acted, his alcoholism is played up for laughs, and both villains are poorly realized in comparison to the other people in Starks' orbit.  Rockwell, in particular, comes off as an incompetent boob incapable of actually leading a company much less rivaling Stark. Vanko, on the other hand, has such a dangerous presence that it's hard to believe he's both a brilliant scientist AND a bird-loving, whip-wielding thug.<br /><br />When Iron Man does bust loose though, it rocks.  War Machine is a welcome sight, and the conflict between Stark and Vanko in the middle of the Circuit de Monaco is thrilling. The fight scenes are exciting, more akin to jet fighters in flight than human-sized tanks.<br /><br />Iron Man 2 doesn't have the emotional heft of its predecessor - it's far too busy to worry about peoples' feelings - but it does pack a solid punch.</p></body></html>

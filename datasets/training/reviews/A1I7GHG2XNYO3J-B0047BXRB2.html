Nope they are stasis chambers used for protection while entering the atmosphere of the Forbidden Planet. I see lots of things that would be familiar to star trek fans as well as a robot,a beautiful young girl and a force much different than anything used in sci-fi movies up to that point. Lots of far out sound FX and a feast for the eyes of a sci-fi fan. The DVD is of the highest quality and plays very well. One of the best!</p></body></html>

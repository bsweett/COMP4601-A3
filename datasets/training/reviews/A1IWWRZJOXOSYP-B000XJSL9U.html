<meta name="summary" content="Getting the Bad Guy"></head><body><p>"Live Free or Die Hard" is a great film.  Even if you had been on Planet Zircon & hadn't seen the first three films, this would still put a smile on your face.  Bruce Willis surpasses recent action efforts such as "16 Blocks" & <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FKO5QK">Lucky Number Slevin (Widescreen Edition)</a>.  Len Wiseman's third film after two "Underworld" vampire pictures puts the audience on a roller coaster that leaves us breathless at the final frame.  Justin Long who may not be all that famous anymore for kissing Britney Spears in "Crossroads" does a great job as computer hacker Matt Farrell.  The opening sequence, where Willis goes to his apartment only to survive barrage after barrage, sets a pace that does not slow.  Timothy Olyphant who to me looks like he should film the Ryan Seacrest bio pic, may make you forget that he played a gay photographer in "The Broken Hearts Club."  He also did good work in "Gone in Sixty Seconds" & "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMX6">The Girl Next Door (Unrated Version)</a>."  As Thomas Gabriel, he smirks, he stews until we're glad he won't be around for DH5.  Maggie Q as his evil girlfriend trumps her job in "Mission Impossible 3" and plays Mai Linh somewhere between an iceberg and a blizzard.  "She likes to kick people," Willis comments.  Mary Elizabeth Winstead from "Grind House" & "The Ring Two" plays Lucy McClane.  She puts a smile on our face as she seems to be a chip off the old block.  "What'd he say about me?" is the perfect ending for the character as she obsesses on her hormonal level.  Kevin Smith who wrote and directed "Clerks" & "Dogma" and is in the upcoming "Catch & Release" does a great job in the cameo role as the computer hacker Warlock.  Bruce Willis infuses McClane with humor that lets us laugh between thrills.  This is a perfect summer film to turn off our brains and cheer getting the bad guy.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

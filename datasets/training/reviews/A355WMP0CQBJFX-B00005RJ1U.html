<meta name="summary" content="NOW THIS IS HORROR!!!"></head><body><p>man, when i watched this movie all i saw were good things. from the previews alone i knew it was going to be scary good, and i was not let down. jeepers creepers, it's a name you won't soon forget. it's not about a gorefest movie, or things like that. it's more about the suspense. it gets pretty intense at some points. i really enjoyed it, and i've watched it many times since. first off, big points for coming up with a wicked looking demon. man, that was nice. pretty unforgettable you know. the whole idea and concept of the film was bangin. this demon comes out to hunt for 23 days and all he does is eat. eat what? well human body parts. whatever he's lacking or has a hunger for if you've got it he wants it, and he won't stop following you until he gets it. he sniffs you out and he decides from who he will take by smelling your fear. now that was nice. unfortunately he's been doing this for a long time, and two innocent kids just happen to stumble on him while riding on this deserted road. they see him, they get curious, and bam he's onto them. the chase is on. he follows in his beat up truck, very eerie looking, and he doesn't give up. the kids are up against something so horrible they have no idea, and by the time they do it's to late. it keeps you at the edge of your seat, and gives you that shiver right down your spine. the ending is great. didn't see it coming, but those screams down in that dark place gave me the chills. what a piece of work. after this you can't help but wonder what's really out there.</p></body></html>

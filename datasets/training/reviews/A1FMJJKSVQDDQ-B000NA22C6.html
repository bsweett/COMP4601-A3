Writer and Director David Koepp gives Stephen King's novella a very nice flow and atmosphere, but it does tend to slow down in a few parts. The shocks and thrills aren't as strong as, say, the ones found in Asian horror films, but all of the gore effects make it more disturbing than shocking. The very good performances by Depp, Turturro, Bello, Dutton, and Hutton should be worthwhile to those who are about to watch this film. I won't give any details to what happens at the end; you should see for yourself.<br /><br />Grade: B+</p></body></html>

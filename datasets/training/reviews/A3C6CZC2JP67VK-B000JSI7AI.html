<meta name="summary" content="Can we already call this film a "Classic?""></head><body><p>I believe we can. This movie will be remembered for years and years to come due to its superb acting, majestic cinematography, incredible dialog, intense emotion, cogent storyline, and the excellent score converged into making this two-hour-plus movie one of the great landmarks in the history of the cinema. I agree with those who say that this movie will be discussed and studied, along with the great ones: `Casablanca,' `Citizen Kane,' etc......<br /><br />Heath Ledger's rough-and-tough-but-tender-and-vulnerable performance is so believable that very little make-up was required in order to try to convince the audience that he is aging right before our eyes. As you watch him, you really do believe that this taciturn young roughneck is actually becoming a middle-aged man who is coming to terms with day to day responsibilities, family life, and an ever-present, nagging, burning need to hold onto a love that will not let him go (Sorry, couldn't resist that phrase). Can't say what has already been said regarding Michelle Williams, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Anne Hathaway because we all know they gave excellent performances.<br /><br />The last twenty minutes of the movie comprise some of the most gut-wrenching and emotionally painful experiences I have rarely encountered in a movie. This film is really hard to forget even though there is a gay context to this film it contains universal themes of love, intense longing, disappointment, infidelity, passion and sexual desire, all of which are applicable to all people, everywhere and anywhere.<br /><br />Ang Lee has done another amazing job putting this film together that was well deserved.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the Best Horror Remakes Ever!"></head><body><p>Horror fans! Don't hate me, but the Rob Zombie remake of "Halloween" could quite possibly be better than the John Carpenter directed original. I love the first "Halloween" (I even caught it at a movie theatre where they played it the night before Halloween and the day of) and I love Rob Zombie's previous two movies. "House of 1000 Corpses" wasn't very good, but I enjoyed it...And "The Devil's Rejects" was one of the best horror films I've ever seen. Zombie's re-imagining of "Halloween" sticks close enough to the original store to not upset horror buffs, but puts his own stamp on it at the same time. One thing the film does is delve a bit deeper into the childhood of Michael Myers. The movie opens on Halloween, where we meet the family. Michael's mother (Sheri Moon) is a stripper with an abusive, drunken, crippled boyfriend. He has a baby sister and an older sister and, besides wearing masks constantly appears fairly normal. Well, for two seconds...Until we watch him slaughter his pet rat. Pretty soon, Michael has killed a schoolyard bully and, while his mother is at work, he kills the boyfriend, his sister, and her boyfriend...Leaving only the baby alive. Sent to a mental asylum, Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell, who is nice to see in a nice-guy role) is assigned to treat Michael. Pretty soon though, Michael has killed a nurse at the asylum and has withdrawn into his mind...And not long after, his mother commits suicide. 15 years later; Michael escapes from the asylum and decides to try and find his sister. Most of the things that happen after his escape will seem quite familar to watchers of the original film. Zombie did a really great job with this movie. Learning about the Myers character was very interesting and creepy. His casting of McDowell (whom he no doubt cast over his love for "A Clockwork Orange") was great, as well as casting Brad Dourif (voice of Chucky) as a cop. The aging of the characters is very well done. When we meet Loomis in the beginning, he looks like a fairly younger guy. 15 years later; Loomis looks like...Well, Malcolm McDowell. "Halloween" has it's share of originality on top of the things that were necessary for the remake (i.e., the music). But this is easily the best remake I've seen of a horror film in a good long while. Rob Zombie is a very gifted writer/director (I'm starting to like his movies better than I ever liked his music) and I hope he continues, because this movie already shows that Zombie has created a signature style (listen to the dialogue between Michael's mother and her boyfriend in the beginning of the film). Anyway, as it is a horror film...It's no masterpiece. And it has its share of nudity and violence, but overall...It's a work of art.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></body></html>

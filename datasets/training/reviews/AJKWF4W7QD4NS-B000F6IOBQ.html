<meta name="summary" content="Not much better than the first film"></head><body><p>I wasn't too bowled over with the original Underworld, which is mainly why I had lowered expectations going in with Underworld: Evolution, and probably why I came out liking it better than it's predecessor, albeit not by much.  The sequel picks up where the first film left off, with death-dealing vamp-babe Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and vampire/werewolf hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman) on the run and out of time, as uber-vamp Marcus (Tony Curran) has risen from his sleep, and seeks revenge against everyone who has wronged him, and seeks to free his imprisoned werewolf brother William (Brian Steele) as well.  While writer Danny McBride and writer/director Len Wiseman attempt to give the Underworld universe a more believable spin this time around, a majority if the film just comes off as lame and predictable.  Where Underworld: Evolution works is in it's dynamic action scenes, in which the blood and gore has been upped considerably compared to the last time around.  The CGI effects are pretty well done as well, particularly the werewolf-transformation effects and frequent dismemberments.  All in all, if you enjoyed the original Underworld, you'll no doubt enjoy Underworld: Evolution, but if you're like me and didn't really dig the first film, Underworld: Evolution won't win you over.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="IT COULD HAVE BEEN EPIC"></head><body><p>THE SCORPION KING<br /><br />Dwayne Johnson has come along way since his wrestling days as far as the movies are concerned. I personally have always liked "The Rock" especially when he was a heel in wrestling, so when I heard he was going to be in "The Mummy Returns" it seemed a natural fit. Maybe some day I will get into that movie but my over all feeling from him was he did a good job with his first role. As a pro wrestler it seems a natural fit for him to move over into movies, he certainly is better than Hogan by a long shot.<br /><br />This is a prequel to the aforementioned Mummy film and as an off shoot or sequel or whatever you want to call it this is pretty good. The story is about an ancient time, apparently before the time of the pyramids [even though the sequel to this which is also a prequel would contradict that], were a great warrior became a king. This king along side a fine sorcerer dominated all other kingdoms and became a tyrant destroying all who opposed him thanks to her visions. That is until the last of a people who are known to be the deadliest of assassins are hired by the remaining tribes to kill the sorcerer. So Mathayus [Dwayne Johnson/The Rock] and his two other fellow people are off to kill Cassandra the sorceress, they fail in their attempt and only Mathayus is left alive. Still he wakes up with his entire body buried except for his head and there are some hungry ants looking for some food. This is were he meets his new partner in crime the slippery thief Arpid, the two make for an amusing pair [every hero needs a comic relief side kick]. From here the two battle the king and his armies, go through massive sand storms, take the sorceress, and do battle with a tribe of all female warriors [sounds like a good time, especially that last part].<br /><br />While this movie certainly has flaws it is one of those turn off your brain for a while and just relax type flicks. The acting is solid and the action is good not to mention there is some very nice eye candy for all us fellas, ladies I suppose you have The Rock to look at. Director Chuck Russell does a good job here with the action in particular as that is the main reason this film was made, and writers Stephen Sommers, Jonathan Hales, William Osborne, and David Hayter did a decent job with the script. It feels flat at times as far as dialogue but even then I never expect much from these types of films in that department. As far as the final outcome this is a pretty good film but it just felt like it could have been epic. A story like this begs for an epic story with an epic outcome, this just seemed like a good story with a good outcome. I just feel like it could have been so much more.<br /><br />As far as the acting every one is solid and seemed like they had a great time making this, I know I would. Dwayne Johnson aka The Rock does a good job on this film but you can see that he gets better with each film but he does a good job on this. Steven Brand is really good as king Memnon as he seems to have had a lot of fun with this character. Same can be said for Michael Clarke Duncan who plays Balthazar the leader of a tribe full of female warriors [lucky him]. Kelly Hu is super fine in this film as Cassandra the sorceress and does a good job with her performance. Bernard Hill as Philos does a great job in this as well in this film, love them explosives. But it is Grant Heslov who I find to be the most amusing in this film as Arpid, don't know what it is but I am a sucker for comic relief.<br /><br />This movie is an enjoyable one but this is not the classic it could have been but at least it is better than most of the things out there. As far as The Rock's first starring film he did a good job and you could see back then that we was on his way to becoming a star. And for those wondering or if you do not know this is a WWE or at the time WWF film, Vince McMahon is an executive producer on this film. This is a fun movie that I would recommend to lovers of action flicks or people who like these back in the day films like Conan.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Super 8 on Blu Ray"></head><body><p>Cut to the chase, this movie doesn't know whether it wants to be 'Stand By Me', ET, or Aliens. Rented the blu ray last night.  Bottom line for me, it that it lacks the soul of Stand by Me or the sheer terror of Aliens.  No real explanation for the magnetic powers of the alien stuck on this planet.  The ending is brought to its denouement in the final 2 minutes, the first of which is that all humans, the kids, are not bad,  the second is the military gives up and bye bye alien.  I give it a 5 out of 10.<br />However, both the video and audio were excellent with critical detail found in the black and shadows and reasonable use of surrounds.  The well trailered train wreck was just great.  While it is the quality of the disc I am most interested in before purchasing, I buy only decent storylines and what I consider good movies and I was terribly disappointed in this one as were the 3 others watching with me.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of help and, if so, please check the 'Helpful' button so I know I am on the correct path with my reviews for you. Thanks.<br />steve</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another stinker from Michael Bay"></head><body><p>Michael Bay's so called "talent" is being able to make cheesy, conventinal, pump-action, predictable "films" for 12 year old bored suburban boys. No matter what trouble his characters get into, they're always pretty and unbruised, and for goodness sake man, you can predict his endings to such a degree that it gets redundant at some point to even watch the previews, they give away the whole plot, whatever that's worth in a Bay film.<br /><br />Example:<br /><br />I'm Michael and I'm lookin' for the next summer box-office flick. So I find a studio and make them give me a script, the script I receive is the compelling story of a terrorist organization that captured governor's Island and are threatening to blow it up unless...whatever. The bad guy also happens to be the good guy's best friend. So the good guy gets to governor's Island, kills everyone, there's a huge fight, explosions, and a love story with a beatiful young, large breasted woman, the conclusion of this 2 hour epic? He kissed the young blonde, saved the world, which was obvious from beginning.<br /><br />The Island only made 12 million dollars it's opening week in the USA. Michael Bay throws together a bunch of car chases and edits them as if they are all part of a TV commercial. He can't stay on a subject for more than 7 seconds without cutting. His movies are so monopaced because of that and so boring. The majority of people don't like his films but because of teenagers who have more disposable income (no rent for most of them), he keeps making money. Michael Bay is pretty bad. I never understood how people use the blanket term "entertaining" to cover films that lack of logical storylines, coherent plots, well developed characters that you can care about, emotional content, etc. Just throw in the formulaic one liners, big explosions, cheesy dialogue and lots of people getting killed and that makes "entertainment"? That just doesn't cut it for me. The only Michael Bay movie I really liked was The Rock - everything else was horrible. By the middle of Armaggeddon, I wanted to put an axe through the TV. Might as well skip the movies and watch WWE Monday nights - it's just as entertaining and you save the $10 on the ticket.<br /><br />Anyway, enough about Michael Bay. "The Island" is becoming a huge disaster at the box office. It's opening day take was $4.2 Million. That is pretty damn bad for a big budget summer movie.<br /><br />How can someone enjoy this film? You'll have to leave your brain at the door, which, for some (such as myself), is the only way to enjoy a Bay movie. Bay movies, to be honest, don't require you to think. Sure, for most of the brain-dead clowny kids of today, that's terrific, which is how Bay's films rank in the big bucks. If Bay continues to make films like he usually does, he's sure to have money in his pocket always, supplied mostly by males in the 18-25 age demographic. This is the age bracket that frequents theaters nationwide, and these are usually the films that they pay to see. Yes, teens are a very powerful market in regards to Hollywood. The movie industry puts their power into a genre depending on the subject's popularity. They aren't going to put a lot of focus into a romance piece if shoot-em-up, hip-hopping action is the trend at the time. It's pretty sad.<br /><br />I give The Island 1 out of 5 stars. Definitely not recommended.</p></body></html>

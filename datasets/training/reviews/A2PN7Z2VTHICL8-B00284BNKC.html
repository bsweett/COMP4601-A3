Even unfeeling husks like myself will not escape unscathed.<br /><br />This is a beautifully mastered film about drug addiction, but not in standard, drugs-are-bad format.  Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) is a junkie who dreams of being a better person but still regularly hawks his mother's battered TV set for fix money.  He and his friend Tyrone Love (Marlon Wayans) and girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) decide to go into dealing, to set themselves up so that they never have to worry again.<br /><br />Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), Harry's mother, is a lonely widow who spends her simple days watching TV, eating chocolates, and gossiping with her friends.  Until she receives a phone call saying that she has won a chance to be on television, and with this dream comes a revitalization of Sara's life.  Determined to fit into her old red dress when they call her to be on television, Sara embarks on a diet.  Unable to resist food, her only companion through her lonely widowhood, Sara goes to a quack doctor for diet pills.<br /><br />It is extremely fascinating how `Requiem' managed to tackle two separate types of addiction in one movie, blending their patterns, their cause-and-effect, and their rise-and-decline results into one sweeping expanse of cinematic pleasure.  Imbedded behind this well directed and well-photographed movie is an eerie soundtrack, with an ominous score repeated throughout the movie giving audio fuel to the increasingly horrific visuals.<br /><br />`Requiem' will leave you hollowed out, numb, aching in a profound and disturbingly vague way.  It is filled with hope and hopelessness, love and destruction, compulsion and self-defeating purposes, centered around that gaping wound called addiction.  Look for spectacular performances from Ellen Burstyn (The Exorcist), Marlon Wayans (Scary Movie 1 & 2), Jennifer Connelly (Labyrinth), and Jared Leto (The Panic Room).  Each of these actors/actresses give us their best performances to date in `Requiem', and tip your hat to the realism from the supporting cast members.<br /><br />If you watch only one movie this year, make it Requiem For A Dream, and if you only get to watch two movies, then watch this one twice.  Also of note, if this movie touches your soul the way it touched mine, go out and grab up a copy of the book `Candy', by Luke Davies.  Also themed around addiction, it uses the same despairing approach to this tender subject as `Requiem' does.  I cannot recommend this movie highly enough.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

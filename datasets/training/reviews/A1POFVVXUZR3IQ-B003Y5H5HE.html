He does not disappoint - this movie far exceeded my expectations, and I actually loved it even more than the book. It was like whatever I had imagined while reading the book (which has lots of graphics btw) was brought to life, only even better!<br /><br />My husband and I took our almost seven-year-old daughter to view this and she was riveted. It is difficult to imagine any child or adult not being captivated by the visuals in this movie. They are truly magical, and though my daughter is obviously too young to get some of the subtler undertones and themes in the movie, she was able to appreciate the visuals and follow the basic premise of the movie.<br /><br />The story itself is one that tugs at one's heartstrings and imagination. Young Hugo Cabret (finely nuanced performance by Asa Butterfield) is an orphan who has lost his father (played by Jude Law) in a fire and is now living on his wits, keeping the clocks running in a large train station in 1930s Paris. His uncle is the real timekeeper, but for a large portion of the movie, we do not know where the drunk has got to. Hugo's father was a clockmaker and had been restoring an old automaton, an object of fascination for both father and son. Upon his father's death, Hugo takes over the automaton, and tries to get it to work, using his dad's notebook as a guide. He steals parts from wherever he can, including the store of Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley), who catches him in the act one day, and becomes irate with anger when he sees the notebook.<br /><br />Over a period of time, young Hugo forms a friendship with Papa Georges' goddaughter, the orphan Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), and the pair discover some of Papa Georges' long-buried secrets. Hugo is in peril though, as the station inspector, Gustaf (Sasha Baron Cohen) holds no tolerance for young orphans and makes it his mission to catch them and have them hauled off to the orphanage. Emily Mortimer plays flower seller Lisette, whom Gustaf pines for, but is afraid to make the first move for fear of rejection and self-consciousness at his crippled leg.<br /><br />There are several bit roles played by some recognizable actors which add to the charm of the movie, but the real appeal of this movie revolves around young Hugo's attempts to get his automaton to work, and how he eventually finds his way 'home'. Along his journey, Hugo discovers the history of cinema, and all the wonders associated with it. The director's love of films shines through in every frame, and the beauty of this film is that it truly dares us to dream and give flight to our imagination!<br /><br />This is a magical film, and a homage to the magic of film-making, that will capture the hearts and minds of viewers, both young and old. The film is rated PG, as there are some intense scenes, though I'd have to say Hugo's father's death is more subtly portrayed here, alluded to by a giant ball of fire. There are some scenes which younger viewers might find scary, such as the scenes of Hugo being chased through the train station by the Station Inspector, etc. but on the whole, the movie is great entertainment for the family.</p></body></html>

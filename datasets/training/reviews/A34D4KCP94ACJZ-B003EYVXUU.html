<meta name="summary" content="Immaculate but Pointless Remake"></head><body><p>The cynic in me hates the reasons for recreating one of 2008's greatest films, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MYIXAC">Let The Right One In</a> or L?t den r&auml;tte komma in, an absolutely perfect romantic horror film that didn't need to be remade at all, much less only two years later.  The reasons are simple; the American audience that fills up theaters is much less likely to show up to a film that is in Swedish and lacks the special effects hooks and quasi-starpower of this remake.  Regardless if it is a remake or not, Let the Right One In is a superior film and I preface this review of its Americanized remake with the highest recommendation I can possibly give to the original.  However, do not let this play down entirely the fact that Let Me In is overall a terrifically disturbing and enjoyable horror film in its own right.<br /><br />The film takes place in Los Alamos, New Mexico and follows a sad twelve year old outcast named Owen (called Oskar in the 2008 movie).  Owen is neglected by his selfish parents and abused, sometimes brutally, by his peers at school.  He's easy to like but has some quirks that really put his relationship with the audience under scrutiny.  Owen is played by Kodi Smit-McPhee who won't get the credit his co-star Chloe Moretz will get in many circles but deserves it just the same.  Owen gets a new neighbor in Abby (played by Moretz, who was great earlier this year as Hit Girl in the super hero action comedy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG983M">Kick-Ass</a>), a strange girl who doesn't wear shoes in the snow and seems altogether careless about her appearance.  Owen and Abby grow to have a wonderful relationship and although the film's sense of romance didn't hook me in as deeply as the original film did, it still works.  The major obstacle to Owen and Abby's budding friendship is simple; she is a vampire.  The supporting cast is great here and the although Elias Koteas's character was not present in the 2008 film, he is a welcome addition if only for the fact that this guy is a such a fantastic actor.  Richard Jenkins, an actor who dominated every frame of another great 2008 film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015OKWKI">The Visitor</a>, plays the role of Abby's "father" and protector.  He is, as always, amazing.<br /><br />I have to give director Matt Reeves (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4OQG">Cloverfield</a>) credit for giving this story the respect it deserves.  He is a very good filmmaker and knows how to make an audience uncomfortable while also connecting to the characters.  He loses some points for taking on a project that either he or the producers merely intended to cash in on, and despite having some meticulous aesthetic strengths he only imitates the over powering atmosphere of the original film.  I don't like some of the special effects used for Abby, in particular the obvious use of CGI, but others will.  I didn't like that the film pulled some punches in areas that might make a more broad audience uncomfortable.  On the other hand I thought that one scene in particular was actually an improvement from the original.  Still, the original can't be touched and shame on them for trying.  But in the end this is a very good horror film by any standard and you should see it before Halloween, because it will be much better than the other garbage you'll be asked to see through endless obnoxious advertisements in the coming weeks.</p></body></html>

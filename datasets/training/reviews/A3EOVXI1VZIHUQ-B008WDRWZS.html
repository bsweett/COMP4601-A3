He loved them so much that he taught elementary classrooms about them for free. He loved them so much that he went and lived with them in a protected wildlife preserve for 13 summers. In that 13th summer, he outstayed his welcome and ended up being killed by one of the grizzlies, along with his girlfriend.<br /><br />In the 13 summers that Treadwell lived with the bears in Alaska, he filmed 100 hours of footage. Director Werner Herzog has taken that footage, along with interviews with friends, family, bear experts, and others and pieced together the story of, as the DVD cover states "A Life Gone Wild".<br /><br />Treadwell is so eccentric that at times it feels like you're watching a fictional film where the lead character is played by Crispin Glover. The way Herzog pieces the film together makes for an exceptional viewing experience because he starts out with all the kind, childlike, sympathetic clips of Treadwell and his bears and slowly begins to insert the footage showing Treadwell's more violent, fanatical nature. As we start to see more of the other side of Treadwell, we feel the despair of having lost a kind-hearted soul to discover that he's actually an extremely off-kilter man.<br /><br />If nothing else, it can be said that Timothy Treadwell lived the way he wanted and lived where he wanted doing what he wanted. Whether he should have is another question. And it's definitely a tragedy that his girlfriend at the time, Amie Huguenard was killed with him following his mad lifestyle.<br /><br />Herzog makes the discreet decision not to play the last 14 minutes of audio clip in which Huguenard and Treadwell are heard screaming while being eaten by a bear. Herzog could have easily based his film around such shocking footage, but instead, he respectfully declined to use it, instead featuring a clip of himself listening to the footage with Treadwell's ex-girlfriend, breaking down into tears himself, and then telling her to destroy the tape and never listen to it.<br /><br />Overall, Grizzly Man is a stunning documentary that provides a brilliant study of a mentally unstable man and the effects of his life.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The film that reveals the heart of the matter"></head><body><p>America was on the verge of colonization.  The tribes lived as they had for millennia, hunting, gathering and honoring the surrounding natural world. They knew nothing of deception, greed, property or bureaucracy, the ills of "civilization". Then one day the great ships came...<br /><br />This is not a standard, play-by-play historical learning tool by any means. The New World looks at these events as if through a dream.  It is all about beauty, wonder and emotion. Not only was the cinematography perfect, but it captured  America's virgin wilderness just as I imagine it must have appeared to the newcomers back then - and in a way that few Americans even today will ever see it. The connection made between John Smith and Pocahontas unfolds slowly, alive and tangible in a way that few other films have managed. I am not normally a romantic, but I fell hard as I watched.<br /><br />The musical score is a hand in hand companion here, building wonder and intensity; this would not have been the same film without it. It haunted me for days.  Between the music and the landscapes a tangible presence was effectively created.  Without the influence of any of the usual, manipulative tricks that directors sometimes employ to symbolize the Divine, my spirit was worshipping God. Glorious!<br /><br />For the actors' part, The New World boasts a great ensemble of quality performers, both familiar and new. Christopher Plummer is of course superb as the captain and overseer of the mission; but Colin Ferrell and Christian Bale went far beyond their usual typecastings as pretty boy action heroes, delivering instead thoughtful and tender portraits of the men who fell in love with Pocahontas. And what can we say about our leading lady, Q'orianka Kilcher, except that she gave this story its heart?  Ms. Kilcher is a fabulous new find, one that I sincerely hope will go far in the film industry as a very nontraditional beauty with genuine talent.<br /><br />You may have seen the animated versions of the Pocahontas story; forget all that. The New World takes this piece of history and elevates it to the level of true art. Was it exactly accurate? I don't know, I'm not enough of a history scholar to say.  But, if you're open to this, you will experience a complete vision.<br /><br />-Andrea, aka Merribelle</p></body></html>

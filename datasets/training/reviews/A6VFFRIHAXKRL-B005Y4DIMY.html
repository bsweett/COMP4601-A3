<meta name="summary" content="He'  l  l raiser review 8/10"></head><body><p>So I'm going to review another horror series for this month & I'm going to review them all even the dreddful direct to DVD sequels. So<br />He'  l  l  raiser released in 1987 directed by Clive Barker who wrote the novel. The movie stars Andrew Robinson as Larry Cotten, Claire Higgans as Julia, Sean Chapman as Frank, Doug Bradley as Pinhead & Ashley Laurence as Kirsty Cotten. Story is this guy Frank bought a puzzle box. When he goes & solves it he gets ripped apart by hook chains & then the 1st appearance by PPinhead & The Cenobites. Frank's Brother & his Wife Julia move into the house Frank's no where to be found he believes he's in Prison cause he has a criminal history. Larry's Daughter Kirsty moves in with her bf cause she doesn't like Julia. Larry cuts his hand on a nail when he was moving a Matterss upstairs. The blood drips on the floor which leads to the attic which brings back Frank who is skinless. He needs blood & or g  an  s to look normal. Julia has history she was cheating on Larry with Frank & she decides to help him she picks up other guys & kills them so Frank can regain his skin. Kirsty sees what Julia is doing. Kirsty is confronted by Frank she throws the puzzle box out the window & runs for it & later passes out. She wakes up in a hospital She solves the box & it summons Pinhead & The Cenobites. She's chased by this 1 creature which is a nice practical effect. Kirsty tell Pinhead about Frank. Frank went & killed Larry & he has control of Larry. Kirsty goes home & then she finds out what happend & Frank & Julia try to kill her but he accidentally kills her & then it leads into the attic where Pinhead & The Cenobites tear Frank apart with great FX no CGI nonsense. They still want Kirsty to come intio their realm. She figures out the box & sends them back. I'm sorry it wasn't an in depth review. But this is a pretty solid horror film. Great effects messed up images. Clive Barker does good job directing. Andrew Robinson was great. Doug Bradley does a great job for the few scenes he had. Ashley Laurence was good likeable character. Sean Chapman did a good job. So that my H  e  l  l  raiser review & I'll review the 2nd which is my favorite.</p></body></html>

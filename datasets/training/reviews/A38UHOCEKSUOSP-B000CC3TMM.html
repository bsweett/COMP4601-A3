<meta name="summary" content="still transporting some fun"></head><body><p>Jason Statham returns again as the cool transporter, this time involved in a less dangerous transporting business - the driver for a wealthy and famous Miami family.  The action and choreography are still as cool as the beautiful scenes of Miami, but the characters and CGI useage hurt this sequal just a tad, thus making it slightly less entertaining than the first Transporter.<br /><br />So on the positive note, Jason Statham is still wonderful in this sequal, fun to watch, and just down right cool to say the least.  The action scenes are fun, and there is still some martial arts to please.  The story is inetersting - at times - and the cinematogrpahy of beautiful Miami makes one want to starting earning the bucks to live in such a gorgeous place.<br /><br />On the down side, the charcaters - especially the villains - are not nearly as enjoyable as the first film.  The boss is rather average, but its his ridiculously skinny girl, who's always in the heat of action, that is somewhat distracting and not in a pleasant manner, despite her skimpy outfits.  The CGI, which was rarely used in the 1st film, is more abundant this time, and is very obvious when used.  Some of the action scenes are so wild, only CGI could be used to execute them.  Unfortunately, they look too fake at times, especially they airplane which just happens to be the climax scene of the film.  It was cool to see Frank (Jason Statham) and the bad guy fight it out inside a plane that was doing loopies, but it also ment no cool choreography for this final fight.  Fortunately, there are some other scenes in the film that show off Corey Yuen's great choreographing.<br /><br />Overall, a good action film that will succed in action entertainment, but don't expect a "great" action film.  Jason Statham is the best part of Transporter 2, the rest is average.  3-1/2 stars overall.</p></body></html>

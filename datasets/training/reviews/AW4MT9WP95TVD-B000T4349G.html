<meta name="summary" content="A not bad sci-fi thriller, a not great movie"></head><body><p>The Forgotten is okay. Some parts are much better than others, but it is never boring to the point where you would give up watching through to the end.  Julianne Moore is (as usual) great and lifts this movie up due to her perfomance alone.  Some good moments, a couple a chills and a less than thrilling conclusion, but worth a viewing if your in the mood for a B-level thriller.</p></body></html>

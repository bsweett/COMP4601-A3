(See "Live Free or Die Hard" for the kind of thing I'm talking about.)<br /><br />Based on the equally grisly novel by Cormac McCarthy, "No Country" is essentially meditation on evil and the way in which evil slowly corrodes the human soul through intimidation, fear, apprehension, and last but not least:resignation.  It is also a thinly disguised commentary on the impotence of authority to protect us from phenomena which arises from the worst of human instincts.<br /><br />Nearly every scene in this film is rich with symbolism, angst, and a sense that things could go horribly wrong at any moment in a huge tide of slaughtered innocence.  Each character represents a piece of the American landscape which, in the present time, has become obsolete.  Josh Brolin's Moss, clearly a cowboy of the classic Bonanza/Western variety, finds that his ethics no longer apply when he comes into conflict with Chiggurh, played by Javier Bardem in one of the best performances I have ever seen in any movie, who embodies the evil and meaninglessness lurking somewhere within us all.  He resembles some kind of bow legged Frankenstein, lurking across the Mexican landscape with his emphysema tank resembling cattle gun, killing sometimes for pleasure and sometimes for principle, taking everything he wants; not so much because he's pursuing the money Moss has as his thorough enjoyment of the entire affair.  Bardem manages to make his voice a grating, terrifying rasp, as though Darth Vader picked up a crack habit and decided to return an re-join the Emperor.<br />Pretty much everyone who comes in his path dies quickly; his coin toss is the only possible salvation, and even that seems tenuous.  If he wants you to die, you do, no matter how much you resist, flee, or hire other people to protect you.  Though it is clear that Chiggurh is human (I wasn't sure until he bled) I have no doubt that the Coen's use him as a metaphor for the absurd ways in which we flee from the inevitable.  Moss goes from hotel to hotel, jumps across national borders, hides in hospitals, and none of it is of any consequence.  You could very safely interpret this film as a very stark reminder that whatever we do, however far we flee, oblivion cannot be avoided, and neither can our humanity.  First Brolin's Moss, after tangling with Chiggurh for awhile and nearly dying as a result, stumbles across three youths walking near the New Mexico border; they ask him if he was in a car accident, and he uses a bloodstained dollar bill to buy a coat from one of them.  Chiggurh does the same thing (with two younger men riding on bikes) at the end of the film, when we finally get to see him bleed a little bit; he uses a similar bloody dollar bill.  The first three youths are eager for the money, and the second group consider it unethical to take money from a man who "has a f**king bone sticking out of his arm".  Hushing up corruption and pain with money, all of it somehow soaked in the blood of another, becomes easier with age.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones is perhaps the most "normal" of all the characters in the film, and we slowly discover that he is going to make absolutely no difference in Moss' fate or the fate of his wife.  He has seen too much gratuitous evil, and he is sick of being involved or even trying.  For all that he has some of the best lines in the film, lecturing the younger sherrif about what he's in for.  They both seem like fossilized relics from a time long past when things made sense and they could keep track of the blood.<br /><br />"No Country For Old Men" is a wake up call of sorts, but for all the questions the Coen brother raise they offer very few answers; perhaps because in the worldly sense there really aren't any.  The death of Carlo Jean and the narrow survival of Chiggurh clinches it: salvation is elusive or even absent in this world. The film left me with such a palpable feeling of nihilism and evil that I could almost taste it; for all that, it was also thought provoking, and simply the best movie I have seen in years.</p></body></html>

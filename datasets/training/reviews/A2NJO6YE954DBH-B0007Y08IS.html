<meta name="summary" content="To date, the best marionette satire film of the 21st century"></head><body><p>I was trying to figure out if Trey Parker and Matt Stone were mainly going after George W. Bush or Alec Baldwin in "Team America: World Police," but it turns out their real targets were Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer (the song "'Pearl Harbor' Sucked and I Miss You" was a big clue).  You think that the Bush doctrine of military intervention is being lampooned, but the guy on the suicide mission wearing the dynamite belt is Michael Moore and there are almost as many liberals killed by Team America as there are terrorists (but I might be wrong on that score as I gave up counting dead bodies in movies ever since "MAD" did the bit about Clint Eastwood in "Where Eagles Dare").<br /><br />The movie starts off with its best sequence as Team America shows up in Paris to save the City of Lights from terrorists with a weapon of mass destruction.  Team America succeeds, but pays a price as one of their members is killed.  Also, there is some collateral damage, but the important thing is that the terrorists were stopped so everybody should just shut up and be grateful (not necessarily in that order).  What we then have is the introduction of the new team member and a whole bunch of standard action movie scenes, only acted out by marionettes following a script written by Parker, Stone and Pam Brady<br /><br />What I can do is assure you that you will be offended by "Team America" at some point during this unrated and uncensored version (I can totally understand why the movie was heading for a NC-17 rating on the basis of two shots during the semi-infamous marionettes having sex scene).  But it is not Parker and Stone unless they go too far and that is certainly preferred to not going far enough (for proof, watching "Saturday Night Live" the next time it is on).  So there are moments when you will laugh yourself silly and other moments where you need to worry about what will come flying out of your mouth if you are not carefully given the visual inspiration provided by the film.<br /><br />Probably the only person who comes out looking good in this movie is Gerry Anderson, the guy who came up with "Thunderbirds" using the process of "Supermarionation," which gets the big screen treatment here (unlike, ironically, the recent "Thunderbirds" theatrical film).  There are some good gags based on treating the puppets like puppets, but the main laughs come at the expense of the action film genre.  You cannot get through the opening titles without having a bunch of explosives and while there are plenty of funny songs the use of heroic music to pump up the fake bonding moments and emotional travails are actually funnier.  I also liked the juxtaposition of interpersonal revelations with explosions as the team finally sorts out who likes whom.  This is not as great as "South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut," but it is the closest that Parker and Stone have come to date, which would be one of those good things you hear about from time to time.<br /><br />The cinematography is by Bill Pope, who shot the "Matrix" films but is a fan of "South Park" and tired of shooting blue screens.  The production design by Jim Dultz, the art direction by John Berger and Tom Valentine, and the set direction by Fontaine Beauchamp Hebb and Richard C. Walker is pretty impressive for a puppet movie and the featurettes will get you to go back and pore over the movie scene by scene to see what interesting things you can spot in this 1/3 scale world.  That will serve you a lot better than trying to figure out the impolite politics of this film.  I am toying with the idea that maybe the film is an attack on the Bush Administration by embracing the use of force and killing all the activist actors.  Or maybe Parker and Stone just do not like actors.  They certainly do not like Kim Jong Il, but then who does?</p></body></html>

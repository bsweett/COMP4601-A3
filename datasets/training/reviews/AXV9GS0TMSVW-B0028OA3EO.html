<meta name="summary" content="An unbalanced story"></head><body><p>Anyone who has seen the first two X-men movies was probably excited to hear Bryan Singer was directing Superman Returns.  In those movies he balanced the human (mutant?) element of the characters with a fair amount of external conflict with Magento and co.  One would think that he could take that formula over to the Man of Steel and make an equally good movie.  Not so.  The result presents Superman at his most vulnerable - which is not a bad thing - but Singer gives us a bit too much of it.<br /><br />Superman returns takes place after the events of Superman II.  Superman returns to earth after taking a 5 year hiatus to go visit Krypton.  What happened during those 5 years is never explained clearly in the film.  This causes it to be more than mildly frustrating when we hear that this is the reason that Lex Luthor got off the hook because Supes couldn't make his court date and that we see a confounded Lois Lane, played by a horribly miscast Kate Bosworth, who has moved on from Superman.  Throughout the film, Superman is trying patch up this relationship.  Singer spends a good amount of the movie showing that Superman is not very good at this.<br /><br />Oh yeah, there is some action in it.  Superman's first act of goodwill on his return involves stopping an air plane from crash landing.  Then there is a good montage of Superman going around helping people and then there is a finale with Luthor which kind of ends with a wimper.  The Luthor/Superman conflict is handled very poorly.  Though props to Kevin Spacey who has the part down really well.<br /><br />In defense of Singer, his biggest crime is not giving a good balance of the human/vulnerable Superman and the Superman who is the greatest superhero in the world.  Singer may have felt that viewers had enough of that and gave more attention to the humanity of Superman. That we see that side of Superman is not a bad thing.  There is too much of it and it never seems to get fully resolved.  Of course there will be sequels and it can be wrapped up there, but for an audience that is gearing up to have Superman back in their lives, this was not the right time to display so much of it.<br /><br />The film is laced with emotion, which Singer and co are good at, but it's too much too soon for the revived franchise.  The world needs a savior, yes, but not a guy who can't get his personal life straightened out.</p></body></html>

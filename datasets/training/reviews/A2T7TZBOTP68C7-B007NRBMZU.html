<meta name="summary" content="Mind-Blowing Thriller"></head><body><p>The Butterfly Effect is a stunning thriller about a young man(Ashton Kutcher) who discovers he has the psychic power to literally relive his childhood traumatic memories.  Obsessed with getting things right between him and his girlfriend in the present, Kutcher just keeps making things worse, to the growing horror and fascination of the viewer.<p>Kutcher's dark and powerful performance is a far cry from his That 70's Show.  One look into his dark, haunted eyes tells you that you will see this young man again on the big screen.  <p>The Butterfly Effect is most profound in the implications it has for our own lives, and the lives of those you love.  This movie has one of the most powerful and moving endings ever.</p></body></html>

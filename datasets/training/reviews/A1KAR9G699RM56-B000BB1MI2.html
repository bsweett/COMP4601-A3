Some for the better and some for the worse, as is often the case.  Oh, and to clarify now, the film is not actually that dark.<br /><br />The plot itself feels a little awry.  For instance, Charlie is treated almost as a sub-character for much of the film, and we are pressed to pay more and more attention to the factory and Willy Wonka himself.  This is particularly true when Burton shows us the newer personal side of Wonka, filled with flashbacks and more.<br /><br />On top of that the whole feel of the musical has diminished, but admittedly they're just not as popular anymore so no surprise.  Oh yes, the Oompaloompas sing, and in quite a  variety of styles too, but don't expect Depp to crack out a note, or the kids.<br /><br />And speaking of Oompaloompas, in the previous versions where obviously a few characters played them, this version has one actor digitally cloned into all of the Oompaloompas.  Not only that, but he is not the most appealing Oompaloompa, as he actually fits the image of a man who I do not think should be around kids.  Oh yes, I definitely loved the musical numbers, and the shrewd comments based around them particularly by the kid characters, but still, scary man.<br /><br />So did I like it?  Yeah, I did, and although I prefer Gene Wilder's version this one gives us another side, perhaps unnecessary side, to this strange yet classic tale of a poor boy and his fortunate and strange trip to the Wonka Chocolate factory.</p></body></html>

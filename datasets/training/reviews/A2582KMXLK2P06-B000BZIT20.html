<meta name="summary" content="an old classic"></head><body><p>Alien is an old, though somewhat scary horror movie.  While most of the horror comes in the form of building up suspense *very* slowly, I think you'll be rewarded for your patience if you are able to sit on the chair and wait for the action scenes to come.  I can imagine people being frightened by the alien back in 1979 because it was designed quite creatively.  It simply looks convincingly scary.  There weren't a whole lot of movies released before this one that contained the same level of fear and suspense, so Alien is definitely a classic movie.</p></body></html>

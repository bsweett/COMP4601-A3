<meta name="summary" content="Mad Max got religion"></head><body><p>There is nothing more to the movie than was promised. It is post-apocalypse and Eli (Denzel Washington) must deliver the last KJB to the west.  To do this he must go through Mad Max territory. He makes a stopover in a town ran by Carnegie. Carnegie is Gary Oldman in his Jean Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg character from "The Fifth Element". I guess some people are distend to always play the ruthless bad guy.<br /><br />So will Eli make it out west and foil Zorg (oops) Carnegie or will the bad guy finally win for once.  After all being ruthless has its advantages. Of course, there has to be a ditzy girl to slow or distract Eli from his mission. In the case, it is Solara (Mila Kunis) who is not aware of the wicked ways of the west.</p></body></html>

I haven't see the original film but I certainly found this remake a thrill ride and felt the actors did a good job with their roles.  Mark Wahlberg is good as the ring leader, Charlie, and Charlize Theron, the lovely Oscar winning actress makes a tantalizing partner for the team as Stella, a whiz at opening almost any safe.  Edward Norton is very good as the sleezy, one-time friend turned villain, who becomes the target of Charlie and Co after a major betrayal. <p>Other cast members include Seth Green, as a computer geek nicknamed &quot;Napster&quot; and Donald Sutherland as Stella's father, once the leader of this team of charming thieves. This is a good action film and worth seeing.</p></body></html>

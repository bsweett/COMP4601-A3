<meta name="summary" content="Exceptional Movie That Crosses Genres And Possibilities"></head><body><p>I'm going to risk coming off like I'm slightly off my rocker to people who are slightly less...eccentric...than I am and say what I really think of "Unbreakable": this movie is the first small portion of what Should happen in the real world.<br /><br />  A train wreck kills every one of its passengers onboard (okay, that isn't the part that should happen in real life, obviously) except one survivor (played by Bruce Willis in his best role ever) who doesn't have a scratch on him.  This attracts the attention of a comic book historian, of all things, who has a most unusual theory on why this one man was able to escape even the slightest injury.  This historian, briliantly played by Samuel L. Jackson, has reasoned out a theory that seems very reasonable, and very very familiar to me personally.  In this current world, we have crime, war, poverty, neverending famine, disease, and every other malady that preys on the world.  Driven by tremendous hardship in the course of his own life, Jackson's character has wondered: could not nature somehow produce a counterbalance to everything that always goes wrong?<br /><br />  "Unbreakable" is filmed in a grim, dark, rather bleak style meant to highlight - in its early portions - the negative aspects of the world rather than the positive ones.  A broken world, for the most part.  And Jackson is looking for something to break the gridlock from a highly unusual source.<br /><br />  Great performances by the whole cast, tremendous suspense, thought-provoking and dream-provoking, groundbeakingly innovative, "Unbreakable" is Willis's best, and possibly M. Night Shymalan's best as well.  Possibly Jackson's best along with "Star Wars", although he didn't play as large a role in those movies (and to be honest, there's still a couple of excellent-looking Samuel Jackson movies out there I haven't seen yet).  This could have spawned not only a sequel or two, but an entire line of movies now that the first crack is in the floodgate.  They wouldn't even have to all have the same characters; the potential for expansion on this concept into a whole movie universe is astonishing.<br /><br />  If you're intrigued by the comic book references and parralells and would like to give one or both of the 'big' ongoing comic universes a try but don't know where to start, I have a few suggestions.  These collections don't require as much of a foreknowledge of the histories and concepts involved, and get right to the hearts of key characters, and thus would make good starting points. DC- "Superman: No Limits", "Batman: Evolution", "Hawkman: Endless Flight", "JLA: Pain Of The Gods".  Marvel- "New Avengers: Breakout", "Incredible Hulk: Return Of The Monster" (well, right to the heart of one of the Hulk's many incarnations anyway), "Astonishing X-Men: Gifted" and "Amazing Spider-Man: Sins Past"</p></body></html>

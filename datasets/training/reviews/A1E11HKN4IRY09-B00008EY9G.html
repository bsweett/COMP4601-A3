<meta name="summary" content="Wickedly twisted."></head><body><p>IDENTITY is a clever premise that is expertly executed.  This flick pulls you in with an honestly good mix of atmosphere, pacing, plotting, and performance.  A feeling of impending doom shrouds the story revolving around a group of strangers stranded at a remote motel in the unending rain.  When they start getting bumped off one by one ala AGATHA CHRISTIE, the fun begins as the interesting plot unfolds into something unexpectedly non cookie cutter hollywood.  The movie plows though it's ninety minutes and gives the viewer some cool unexpected curves.  An excellent late night noirish chiller that hits the mark.  The 'alternate ending' on the DVD is really nothing special.  There are very subtle differences that do not change the impact of the film.  The film itself, however, is well worth it.</p></body></html>

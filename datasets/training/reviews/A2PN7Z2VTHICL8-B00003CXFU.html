<meta name="summary" content="True story of David and Goliath in modern terms"></head><body><p>PG&E, Pacific Gas And Electric company, unintentionally polluted ground water for the town of Hinkley, CA, but tried to cover it up rather than admitting they had caused a major health problem to the residents.  This cover up went on for a long time, until a barely-employable spitfire named Erin Brockovich, working for the lawyer Ed Masry, uncovers a strange file of real estate documents which include medical records.  Curious as to why a real estate file would contain medical documents, she begins to research the case.<br /><br />What follows is the true story of a woman named Erin Brockovich, who together with Ed Masry uncovered a major cover up of a health hazard resulting in one of the largest settlements in history.  This film is extremely well done, dividing its time between Erin the worker, Erin the single-mom trying her best to raise her three kids, and Erin the human being.  The movie skates over the fact that the real Erin got sick along with the rest of the town (although you can see some cut scenes of her illness in the "deleted scenes" feature).<br /><br />The movie is definitely a dramatized reproduction of the true story, though it still manages to hold very close to the truth.  A&E has done a special on the Erin Brockovich case which proves the movie stays true to form.  Julia Roberts as Erin and Albert Finney as Ed Masry both give excellent performances.  The movie isn't necessarily fast-paced but the dialogue is intriguing, intense at times, and funny at times, keeping the entertainment level high.  The acting and dialogue alone are enough to carry this film.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the little guy taking on the giant, or a fan of Julia Roberts, either way you won't be disappointed.  Like Grisham's fictional 'The Rainmaker', you'll feel satisfied that sometimes the little guy can win ... in real life.  I recommend a 'buy'.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

After seeing countless horror films trying to be scary and frightening by using predictable tactics and loading on computer generated blood and gore, my faith that horror films of old that didn't rely on blood, gore, and gross out effects to be scary (Poltergeist, Pumpkinhead, the original Halloween) would be returning in films such as The Ring, but I was very disappointed. The film starts out with an eerie opening and some nice scares leading up to an investigation by a reporter (Naomi Watts from Mulholland Drive) into the death of her niece which involved a video tape rumored that if one watches it, seven days later you'll die. While the storyline is interesting and has a bit of originality to it, it seems that director Gore Verbinski wanted the film to be too suspenseful. Not to mention some things are never explained in the film (such as why the horses flipped out) and by the time the credits start rolling you'll have more questions than answers. The acting is pretty well done, but the child actor playing Watts' son seems a bit out of place and a little creepy himself.  What really makes me wonder though is how big a hit The Ring was in theaters, most of which were populated by mid-teen girls who had never heard of and/or seen any films gracing titles like Evil Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Pumpkinhead, Last House On the Left, or Hellraiser.  Those films were original (the first installments of the ones which became a series that is) and truly deeply scary.  The Ring is simply overrated, and is teen horror at it's near worst.  I suggest checking out the Japanese film it was based on; Ringu, that is at least watchable.</p></body></html>

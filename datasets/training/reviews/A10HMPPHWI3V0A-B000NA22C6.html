<meta name="summary" content="His secret, hidden from himself... Johnny get into the "Depp-th's" of the film."></head><body><p>Johnny Depp Stars as Mort Rainey, a semi-famous author living in the mountians as a sort of shelter from his (pending) ex-wife who cheated on him in a hotel with Ted Milner played by Timothy Hutton, her current fiance (also understandably,... pending). Very soon after the movie begins we meet John Shooter, an angry and very eccentric Mississppi man who is led to believe that Mort plagerized one of his beloved stories, "Secret Window" (what a suprise!),. Conflicts rise, animals are killed, people get mangled with screw drivers while others get diced with axes. You get the picture if you have seen a few horror or thriller films. The movie though is more of a guessing game for the first hour or so but in the end lies a twist, dont get to excited because the twist is actually quite common in films nowadays ... but overall all very good acting makes veiwers to believe that the film is actaully better than it is. The story is based on a Stephen King novel. The screenplay is really not hat great same goes for the directing, but overall I found the film to be somewhat convincing and overall pretty good with the ending. Though the ending might be some what confusing, if you were paying attention than you should understand everything just fine. Johnny Depp gets right down within the "Depp-th's" of the film and is really convincing. John Turtorro's performance as the bad guy (John Shooter) is also really good.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good horror film than this is not for you, it's PG-13, very low on blood and not at all scary, BUT the film his more than it's share of sheer suspense and is a pretty good, involved thriller.<br /><br />Grade: B-</p></body></html>

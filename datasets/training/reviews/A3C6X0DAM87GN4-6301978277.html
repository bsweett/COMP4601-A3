<meta name="summary" content="One Of Wilder's Wildest!"></head><body><p>A.F.I's choice for the funniest movie ever made, is indeed quite funny.  Whether it's the funniest movie of all time, is a mere matter of opinion,  and not at all &quot;a fact&quot;. Great performances by Jack Lemmon, Tony  Curtis, and Marilyn Monroe. The standout to me is Joe E. Brown who delivers  of course the famous ending line, &quot;Nobody's perfect.&quot; A very good  script written by I.A.L Diamond and Wilder. Much ,much better than their  later outting &quot;The Fortune Cookie&quot;. A excellent fast paced,  humorous, movie which deserved to get Lemmon an Oscar nomination, but  unrightly over-looked Curtis and Monroe! Top moments are Monroe singing  &quot;Running Wild&quot; and my personal favorite &quot;I'm Thru With  Love&quot;, I couldn't stop laughing when Curtis ,dressed up like a woman,  actually kissed her after the song! I enjoyed the scenes with Brown and  Lemmon out on the town, dancing the tango. And of course the famous ending  scene. Also the great George Raft turned in a &quot;fun&quot; performance  as &quot;Spats Colombo&quot;. A great movie everyone in need of a good  laugh should watch. A COMEDY CLASSIC!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Avengers crossed with Mystery Men"></head><body><p>To be honest LXG is probably the underdog because X-Men seems to have this summer blockbuster category filled and even though LXG tries very hard to be a contender it can go nowhere near really hitting on what X-Men has achieved and certainly Spider-man has nothing to worry about. So where does it rank? Well if you did not like The Hulk then you will find LXG a much more suitable superhero mash.<p>LXG has a few problems. Sean Connery is not exactly flaring across the screen and even though all the other superheroes are given enough screen time it is surprisingly a fairly wooden affair with not much fleshed out in the way of their backgrounds even though quite a bit is hinted at. So really our dependence in engaging these characters is with their action quality. We would expect LXG to have lots in that department, but sadly what action there is just turns out to be a "been there before and bought the T-shirt" except for one good action sequence in Venice which is quite frankly a little bit hard to follow or understand and never really amounts to much. So the action is a way below par, especially if you have seen the likes of Blade from the same director - Stephen Norrington.<p>Where LXG really stands out is in the design and the concept realized onto the screen looks simply amazing. It is like Batman crossed with Wild Wild West. In fact Wild Wild West is exactly the same kind of summer bummer unblockbuster as this one. LXG looks incredible and certainly moves along at a good pace but ultimately it just as forgettable with nothing to really make you want to catch a sequel.<p>When all is said and done LXG is far from the worst DVD you can pick up for some pop-corn fodder entertainment but at the same time is pretty much an under-nourishing experience with some good scenes but not a great movie. The plot is a little banal and certainly the twists that come about are not really anything suspenseful. I somewhat enjoyed it enough to say that it was worth watching if there is nothing better on the shelf but I would not exactly be running to the cinema to see the sequel by any means.</p></body></html>

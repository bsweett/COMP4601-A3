It would all be for naught if the effects didn't compliment a good story(See "Wanted") but that's not the case here.  This a breezy comic sci-fi concoction that goes down as smooth as lemonade.  The action is terrific and it's complimented by cheeky humor.  Park your brain cells and enjoy some great summer entertainment.</p></body></html>

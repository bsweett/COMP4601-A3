<meta name="summary" content="A fun 90 minutes"></head><body><p>When I first heard of this movie, I was not looking forward to it.  However, I really liked it.  It is the story of a Greek woman who is part of a huge, cohesive family unit, who not only does everything with each other, but owns their own restaurant.  They won't even associate with anyone who is not Greek.  The woman's name is Toula.<p>Toula is somewhat lonely, because she is single.  Her dad wants her to do what Greek girls do.  Marry a Greek man, have a bunch of Greek kids, and make lots of Greek food.  Of course, she meets an American man, falls in love, and marries him.  This pleases her dad none too much, therein lies the conflict.<p>The movie is about the characters, not the plot.  The actors are all relative unknowns.  There is not one legitimate star in the cast.  It's similar to &quot;Blair Witch Project&quot; in that it was a sleeper hit.  Not a large budget, small opening circulation.  But word of mouth is still the best advertising.  <p>This movie will appeal to you if your family is anything like this one.  My family is not like this, but I see my wife's family here.  They are tight knit, and they do everything together.  However, they only use Windex to clean the glass.</p></body></html>

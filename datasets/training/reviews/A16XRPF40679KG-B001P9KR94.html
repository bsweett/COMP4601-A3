It has 12 deleted scenes and several other bonus features that some dvd pressings did not have evidently.  You have 156 people mostly telling you that this is a great movie, and are they all correct? Absolutely , this is a great movie that has strong characters and is easy enough to follow even though the story jumps from the police station to the game show and back into the past of the main character. This seems confusing but it's not at all. The story is a solid story of the terrible conditions the poor are facing in the hugely overpopulated democratic country of India.  The picture deeerved it's best picture oscar because it tells it's story well , and it is as well acted as any A budget movie made anywhere else in the world.  This isn't bollywood though; a type of movie which had musical numbers thrown into the middle of it and which has it's place in world cinema; this is straight forward filmaking with solid direction and a more western style of storytelling.  Which is why it holds up well against the many other great movies made in the last 100 years and rightly joins them as a top effort in film.  The story of a slumdog orphan escaping poverty and by strange coincidences having his life mirror the questions on the Indian version of "Who wants to be a millionaire!".  The actor who plays the host of the show also creates a  very engaging and interesting character. He is all about himself yet not a villian and he certainly doesn't like to be reminded that he was once himself a slumdog.  The blu ray looks great and the sound is excellent. This is the reason to buy a blu ray player so that you can see movies they way they looked largely at the movie theater and this disc comes close to that.  So go blu ray and you won't regret it.</p></body></html>

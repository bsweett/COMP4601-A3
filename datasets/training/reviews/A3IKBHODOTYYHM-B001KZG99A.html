<meta name="summary" content="Great comic book movie!"></head><body><p>What was enjoyable about Iron Man was that it was a smart addition to the Marvel Comics film adaptations. There are some action scenes, but they don't attempt to mask or steal the show or moral of the movie (that weapons in the wrong hands can have devastating results). After realizing that his father's company was inadvertently leading to the destruction of lives, and after having a terrifying experience being held hostage in the Middle East, multimillionaire Tony Stark (Downey) changes his tune of his invention-making ways, saying that he will not create anything aimed at destruction again. However, some information of making the perfect destructive machine has leaked, and now it is in the wrong hands. Sometimes the ones closest to you are the ones who turn against you, and now Tony battles both sides of evil.<br /><br />Although the film was two hours, it was a quick two hours because of the pacing of the film. There aren't crash scenes that drag on for long periods of time, and the plot and script were well-written enough to keep all main characters involved in the climactic and critical scenes. The major characters all did great jobs in their roles: Gweneth Paltrow does a commendable job as Stark's assistant, and Jeff Bridges does an excellent job Stark's company business partner.<br /><br />I would rank this film just a shade lower than Spiderman 2, but I think they are two of the best comic book movies out there in recent years.</p></body></html>

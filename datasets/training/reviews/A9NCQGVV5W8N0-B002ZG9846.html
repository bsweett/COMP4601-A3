He spends his days fixating on his English teacher's breasts, reading comic books, hanging out at the local comic store with his equally feckless friends and wasting far too much time on social networking sites on the internet. It is this life of unremitting banality - as well as his own inherent naivety - that leads him to don a green and yellow diving suit and mask and attempt to live the life of a superhero. However, as Dave is about to find out, trying to dispense comic book justice and cookie-cutter morality on the streets of a mob-town like New York can be a very dangerous idea indeed...<br /><br />Matthew Vaughn's "Kick Ass" is a glorious satire of the notions of super-heroism, vigilantism, fanboy culture and Gen Y's obsession with spectacle and hyper-reality; I also suspect that is probably a very faithful adaptation of Mark Millar's comic book (and whilst I haven't read this particular book myself, I am familiar enough with the rest of Millar's work to recognise the pertinent hallmarks of lunatic genius that have made the mad Scotsman a "force majeure" in the comic book industry) given that it is violent, foul-mouthed, disturbing and amusing in equal measures (and on a number of different levels) and it is, for the most part, whip-smart. As a screen outing, its also a far more satisfying depiction of Millar's obsessions than the awful "Wanted" movie (a film which took an amoral tale told amorally and attempted to sanitise it for the screen).<br /><br />I can't really go into too many details of the plot without ruining this film but all I will say this: if you're sick of the nauseating pontification that gets shoe-horned into most modern American action cinema, then this will be right up your alley because its a glorious fart in the face of conventional cinematic wisdom and morality. Parents should be warned though that despite being tangentially about superheroes, this film is emphatically NOT suitable for children. Don't let the shiny costumes fool you. It is an adult fairy tale with a pronounced accent on the "adult".<br /><br />For the record, my partner and I generally despise Superheroes and Superhero movies on the grounds that most of them are nauseatingly smug morality plays which have no basis in reality - that was not the case with this film. We both thoroughly enjoyed it and it left us wanting to adopt a "Hit-Girl" of our very own.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="GOONIES Are Good Enough For Me"></head><body><p>I've always loved THE GOONIES. It's arch villains (the Fratelli's and their Mama with her tatoos) are inspired casting!  The film has an innocent, Hardy Boys sense of adventure that is hard to resist.  I've always enjoyed the hyper-active line readings in the film. You can tell that director Richard Donner created an ad-lib atmosphere on the set. Some of the lines are hilarious and I always hear something new during repeated viewings.<p>The DVD has a great bonus:  The commentary is a screen within the film of the reunited actors.  They got everybody back!  Check out how the child actors have grown up!  Some of the commentary is hilarious.  Martha Plimpton has some particularly enjoyable memories and a ferocious laugh.<p>The cut scenes (including the famous Octopus scene) are disappointing.  The Octopus looks really fake.  No wonder they cut it!  The digital revolution of the 90's really changed filmaking.  Today, the Octopus would be CGI.<p>Also, it was fun to see the second part of Cyndi Lauper's &quot;Goonies&quot; video.  I used to watch MTV all the time, trying to catch part two!  I never saw it.  It seemed like they only played part one.  This video, with its campy wrestling stars and lovely, kooky Cyndi, is a hoot!<p>As the Cyndi Lauper song goes: THE GOONIES &quot;are good enough for me&quot;.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Return of Khan. The Death of Spock."></head><body><p>This is the second motion picture with the original STAR TREK cast (1966-69).<br />  Before you see this film, you should see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VDDDY6">Star Trek: The Original Series - Season One (DVD/HD DVD Combo, Remastered Edition)</a>, Episode 22, "SPACE SEED" (originally broadcast February 16, 1967).  It is the first time we see Ricardo Montalban as  "Prince Khan Noonian Singh".<br />  When we last saw Khan, he and his crew were exiled to Ceti Alpha 5.  This motion picture is a sequel to the tv episode as well as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JKHP">Star Trek - The Motion Picture: The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)</a>  (1979).<br />  Stardate 8130.43: Spock (Leonard Nimoy) is now the Captain of the Enterprise.  James T. Kirk (William Shatner) is now Admiral and it is his  birthday.  Kirk is beginning to feel his age at 51, but what he really wants to do is helm the Enterprise again.<br />  Having been transported down from the NCC 1804 Reliant, Captain Terrell (Paul Winfield) and Commander Chekov (Walter Koenig) scout around on what they think is Ceti Alpha 6. It is an especially windy barren desert.  They find a cargo ship and inspect it inside.  Chekov (Walter Koenig) begins to remember a few items when suddenly he recalls Botany Bay.  He quickly warns Captain Terrell that they must leave now.  They are captured by a crew.  The leader unveils his face protection.  It is Khan! Khan (Ricardo Montalban) recognizes Chekov and decides to hold both men hostage.  Khan explains that their were 70 of his crew on Ceti Alpha 5, but when Alpha 6 exploded, it sent Ceti Alpha 5 off course.  Kirk never bothered to check on Khan's progress.  Khan shows the men an overgrown earwig that killed his wife and other crew members.  He puts a young earwig into Chekov and Terrell's ear as it wraps around inside to grow causing excruciating pain and madness.  Khan demands to know how to find James T. Kirk.  Khan wants revenge.<br />  Dr. Carol Marcus (Bibi Besch) who is creating a new planet surface called, Genesis, also has another surprise for her former boyfriend of 20 years ago, Kirk's son, David (Merritt Butrick).<br />  All of the original cast members are present including John Winston as "Kyle" who also appeared in the first STAR TREK tv series (1966-69).<br /><br />  We have known Ricardo Montalban from his films and the "Fantasy Island" tv movies, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AO9D5E">Return to Fantasy Island</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B8IA3U">Fantasy Island - The Complete First Season</a> tv series (1977-84).  Montalban is delightfully evil in STAR TREK: THE WRATH OF KHAN (1982).

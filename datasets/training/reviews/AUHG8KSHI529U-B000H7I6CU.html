<meta name="summary" content="A good family film, but somehow we expect more than good from Pixar"></head><body><p>Well, maybe something got past me because I am not a NASCAR devotee, but this one seemed pretty much an ordinary "fish out of water" story with few twists or turns or delights.  It isn't that it is bad.  In fact, it is even enjoyable to watch with kids.  However, it just didn't have any "wow" factor.<br /><br />The look is pretty good and some of the cars are even dazzling (if preposterous) to look at.  However, the story of the selfish young hotshot having to basically lose it all, but then learning about friends who pull him through is quite old.  It is a useful story for kids to learn (and adults who didn't learn the lesson as kids), but somehow I wanted Pixar magic to kick it into overdrive - to use some Nitro.  But it just sort of plodded along.<br /><br />The voices were all good.  Why Paul Newman is there becomes clear in the second half of the movie.  Owen Wilson puts in the right amount of ego with enough humanity to learn as the star "Lightning McQueen" (will that name seem cool to anyone who doesn't know Steve McQueen?  McQueen???).  Bonny Hunt is good as Sally Carrera.  And Tony Shaloub and Cheech Martin are fine color characters.  Especially fine, I would say.<br /><br />But do we really need Larry the Cable Guy as Tow Mater?  Isn't that awfully - well, awful?  It isn't that I hated them going out tractor tipping, or Mater showing McQueen some moves that McQueen didn't understand, but a buck toothed hick?  Who thought that was witty?  Let them know it wasn't.<br /><br />The bit with John Ratzenberger over the credits was quite well done and shows the kind of sparkle that I wish had been in the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Still, a pretty good movie.  Just not up to the standards we expect from Pixar.</p></body></html>

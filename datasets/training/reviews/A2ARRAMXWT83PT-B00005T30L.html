<meta name="summary" content="Ghost World: What a film!"></head><body><p>This has got to be one of the most thought provoking films ever. Thora Birch, Steve Buschemi, and Brad Renfro all give memorable performances. It was so funny in it's own little sarcastic way! Any teen who watches this movie, or any adult for that matter, knows that they have been through the same situations before in life, or atleast have felt that way before..all alienated, like the world just hates you. The writer of this film new how to find humor in these situations, and pulled it off! <p>All together, a very moving and funny film that all should see! Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

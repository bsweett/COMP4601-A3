<meta name="summary" content="A Haunting We Will Go..."></head><body><p>THE OTHERS is another wonderfully dark, modern ghost story like THE SIXTH SENSE, THE RING, etc. Nicole Kidman (Invasion, Dead Calm, Practical Magic) is the center and soul of the movie. She carries the story all the way through to its twisty conclusion. She is not only beautiful, but a fantastic actress as well. The film itself is gloriously sombre and mysterious. THE OTHERS turns the typical supernatural tale inside-out! This "haunted" house is not your run-of-the-mill spooky mansion. Something is going on within its walls that will cool even the most jaded heart. Unlike fx-dependent mush like the re-makes of THE HAUNTING or HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, THE OTHERS relies on excellent story-telling, bleak atmosphere, and fine performances to do the job. Highly recommended...</p></body></html>

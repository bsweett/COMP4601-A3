This movie was not something that I would be interested in seeing again.  I found the plot to be pretty good, but the rest of the movie as it played out was BORING!!!  Cage's narration throughout the flick was annoying too!!  I was just waiting for this movie to get better, but it never did.  You may find yourself just sitting there bored to tears with this one, as I did!!</p></body></html>

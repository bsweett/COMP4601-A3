The spiritual successor to The Matrix, Equilibrium had the perfect mix of cinematography, pathos, and action that has rarely been equaled. And the first thing I thought when watching Ultraviolet was..."Wow, this is a terrible imitation of Equilibrium."<br /><br />Equilibrium used its special effects sparingly, cutting away when appropriate, zooming in when necessary, and always remaining focused on relationships despite the nihilistic setting. To my surprise, Kurt Wimmer, director of Equilibrium, also directed Ultraviolet.  Something clearly went horribly awry.<br /><br />The parallels between the two films are striking.  The fabled Gun Kata - a martial art using pistols - is clearly in evidence in Ultraviolet. The same dystopian future plagues humanity, only instead of emotion the authorities suppress hemophages (a cute term for vampires). And just like in Equilibrium, the main character's relationship with children is at the crux of her redemption. And yet Equilibrium is superior to this film in every way.<br /><br />Buried somewhere in Ultraviolet is a parable about fear, misplaced trust, and abuse of authority - all the same themes explored in Equilibrium. The special effects are generally above par, the combat scenes impeccable, and Mila Jovovich (as Violet) is as deadly sleek as ever. But when the CGI clearly doesn't hold up, the camera never looks away.  When combat scenes should be beautiful they become blurry jump-cuts of confusion.  When Violet gets mad, instead of a cold killing machine she comes off as a mumbling thug. Aeon Flux she ain't.<br /><br />Ultraviolet has high ambitions for its comic book "Japanimation" aesthetic, but it fails by simply being all violence all the time. Equilibrium had a similar premise but it pulsed with love, sorrow, and rage.  Conversely, Ultraviolet has the emotion dial set to angry and keeps it there. It's not that the movie is terrible - it simply has no soul.</p></body></html>

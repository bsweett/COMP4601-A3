And then it took some time and thinking to realize the film isn't about Khan---it's about revelation and realization, that terrible sensation that is a common trope in any adventure series featuring close friends: the moment where one realizes that they are not invincible.<br /><br />Admiral Kirk has gone through the vast majority of his career smoothly, a stalwart hero as likely to resolve a conflict with words as with fists, and always able to rely on his trusty friends.<br /><br />And he's bored.  He's old, he's bored, and he can't stand it.<br /><br />His career-long invincibility was actually a crutch to him, as he had glided through for so long, always having an escape plan or a secret option to escape from defeat.  The Kobayashi Maru "no-win scenario" running plot-MacGuffin is in no way a Red Herring---it comes back around and smashes Kirk in the face when he realizes his refusal to accept a no-win scenario worked for him in the past, but it will never truly work out in the end.<br /><br />Spock dies.  That's not a spoiler; it's a forgone conclusion.  Spock's death isn't just a tacked-on "SHOCKING SWERVE~!" thing I had originally called it in my review.  Spock's death was in no way something to justify Khan being considered such a fiendish villain.<br /><br />Spock's death was that moment, that revelation.  It was the moment Kirk realized there IS no cunning solution to the Kobayashi Maru.  It was the moment Kirk realized he is NOT invincible.  Indeed, Khan (at least until movie three) did exactly what he wanted to do to Kirk---he hurt him.  And he made sure Kirk would go on hurting, for a long while.<br /><br />Kirk himself states at the end that he "feels young".  In fact, he does.  Having lost his best and closest friend, he is suddenly shown that he is not immortal, and he cannot loll through missions and commands expecting everything to work out in the end because it's "Star Trek".  He has cheated death all his life through all his missions, and death finally strikes him, not where it could do the most damage, but where it could HURT him most significantly.<br /><br />Khan is still a lackluster villain to me.  Ricardo Montalban is magic with his acting talent, and brings an epic, operatic quality to Khan Noonien Singh.  But that's about it.  There's a huge multitude of parallels with Khan, the character and the movie, involving "Moby Dick" and "Hamlet" and "King Lear", and spectacularly executed with Khan's mirroring of Captain Ahab, blindly chasing his quarry, to the death and destruction of himself.<br /><br />Above all, it's worth mentioning this is NOT an action movie.  It's an insult to this movie and it's dramatic, operatic quality to call it as such, especially when comparing it to "Star Trek: The Motion Picture".  It's a common barb of fans of The Motion Picture to claim people like Wrath of Khan more because it's more action-packed.<br /><br />No, it's not.  People like Wrath of Khan more because of the STORY and the depth and skill by which it is told, with deep themes on weighty issues such as death, aging, rebirth, and revenge, that resonate through all time, and are handled in a highly complex manner which most people would completely miss from their first viewing of the film, likely due to the stigma of "geekiness" and "goofy garbage" that Star Trek has.<br /><br />"The Motion Picture" was an adaptation of a failed TV series pilot featuring the original crew.  It involved a 30 minute story dragged out to nearly 2 hours, with blatant padding all around, from a FOUR MINUTE UNCUT sequence of just Kirk and Scott looking at the Enterprise while SLOWLY flying around it in a transport pod, to EVEN MORE SEQUENCES EVEN LONGER of the crew just staring into V'Ger's cloud, and arbitrarily cutting back to people's faces as they stare out the window.  "2001" Star Gate sequence this ain't.<br /><br />The Motion Picture was full of long periods of nothing, and a very powerful theme of obsession---that of Kirk with command of the Enterprise---that was childishly "resolved" not by any character development or revelation, but by having the one person opposing his command (Decker) conveniently exit the picture without really dying, but more or less dying.<br /><br />Wrath of Khan does not avoid any weighty issues or themes.  There is no quickfix solution to anything.  Kirk can't just have Khan's ship explode, then shield the Enterprise in some kind of Nebular vacuum spot where he can survive the Genesis explosion.  Kirk can't just blast Khan out of the sky and fly home victorious.<br /><br />In some way, Kirk has earned redemption in this film for all the swaggering and slickness of his days of youth in The Original Series.  He is hurting, and he will go on hurting...<br /><br />At least until Star Trek III: Search for Spock.</p></body></html>

This is War!!"></head><body><p>+++++<br /><br />This movie is based on Robert Heinlein's 1959 classic science fiction novel of the same name.<br /><br />The movie begins with an advertisement from the "Federal [Military] Network" where young people are encouraged to join the military "to become a citizen." (A citizen as opposed to a civilian is a military person.)  We are also shown how the Earth can defend itself against "the arachnoid [or bug] threat."  (Yes, the aliens threatening to destroy Earth in this futuristic sci-fi movie are giant bugs and they live on a bug planet.)<br /><br />Then the story switches to the four young people who have made the decision to join the military during peacetime:  (1) Johnny Rico (Casper Van Dien), (2) Carmen Ibanez (Denise Richards, the ex-Mrs. Charlie Sheen), (3)  Dizzy  "Diz" Flores (Dina Meyer), and (4) Carl Jenkins (Neil Patrick Harris).  Johnny's decision is heavily based on what Jean Rasczak (Michael Ironside) tells him.<br /><br />Eventually full-scale war with the bugs ensues.  During this part of the movie (which mainly follows the exploits of Johnny) there are intense, graphic action sequences (thus this movie is definitely not for children).  The special effects are spectacular as well.<br /><br />If this movie was only about what I said above, I certainly would not give it the rating I did.  But the movie is more.  It is actually a not-so-obvious, comical satire of fascist propaganda with an emphasis against military conformity and a warning of the sickening realities of war.  (Fascism is a system of government characterized by one-party dictatorship, private economic enterprise under central government control, racism, militarism, etc.)  However, like I said, this is not obvious and I suspect that many people will only see this movie as humans fighting giant bugs.  (In fact, this would explain the one- and two-star ratings below this one as these people saw the movie on its most obvious level.)  You have to watch this movie carefully and not let the dazzling effects distract you.<br /><br />All the actors, contrary to what other reviewers say below, do a good job in their roles especially with respect to the comical aspects of this movie.  (I suspect that there were many retakes as some of the actors probably cracked up laughing.)  I have to give special kudos to Michael Ironside as the determined Lieutenant Rasczak for an exceptional fine acting job.  ("Rasczak" means "bastard" in Tchzekkian.)<br /><br />Finally, the special edition DVD is practically perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has many interesting extras.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a unique movie that has to be closely viewed in order to be fully appreciated.  As such, I feel that it is a movie not to be missed!!<br /><br />(1997;  2 hr 10 min;  2 discs;  widescreen)<br /><br />+++++</p></body></html>

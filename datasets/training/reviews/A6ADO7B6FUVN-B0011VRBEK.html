<meta name="summary" content="Brutally Raw & Brilliantly Inspiring Revenge Film..."></head><body><p>Oldboy has a Shakespearian tone as it depicts the tale of Oh Dae-su (Min-sik Choi), whose name means "he who can get along with people".  Oh Dae-su is on his way home after having been arrested for public drunkenness to celebrate his daughters birthday.  However, Oh Dae-su never arrives to his home as he is kidnapped and imprisoned in a small room where his only contact with the human world is a television.  During the time Oh Dae-su is caged someone murders his wife and he becomes the prime suspect for the murder.  The questions that Oh Dae-su unsuccessfully attempts to answer while locked up is why revenge is being taken on him and who is seeking this cruel revenge.  After 15 years Oh Dae-su is released from his torturous imprisonment, which leaves him confused and ragingly vengeful.<br /><br />Chan-wook Park directs a brilliant cinematic experience that is full of well-written conspiring intrigues that will keep the audience in suspense.  The suspense is initiated in the opening shot where a man is hanging over the edge of a roof top causing the audience to asks themselves--why is this happening?  The suspense continues as new and mysterious clues appears, but apprehension does not leave the audience even after the end of the film as the final line echos in the minds of the audience.  Park's vision of revenge in Oldboy often depicts exaggerated violence that is well balanced with story as it is related to the themes of the film.  However, this should serve as a warning to squeamish folks as the film is occasionally brutal and bizarre.  Furthermore, the cinematography used in Oldboy vividly projects the emotional tone of the cinematic themes and characters.  The characters are also superbly performed by an excellent cast, which will help the audience to experience a first class cinematic event.</p></body></html>

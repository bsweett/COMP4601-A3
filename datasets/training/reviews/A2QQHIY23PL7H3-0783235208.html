<meta name="summary" content="Above-average old school adventure flick"></head><body><p>The Mummy is a throwback to two different schools of filmmaking: the globe-trotting republic serial adventure flicks (where Indiana Jones took inspiration from) and also the monster horror genre for which Universal Studios is famous for. The plot-line is pretty well-known; explorers and treasure hunters disturb a mummy's tomb, and he comes back to seek revenge. Only now instead of a man wrapped in bandages, we get sleek, sexy, bald Arnold Vosloo in robes and enhanced by computer graphics. And instead of the plastic, gung-ho hero we get the very likeable Brendan Fraser.<br /><br />The Mummy is a pretty fun film from a relatively undistinguished director. If you dig the romanticized, Indiana Jones-style adventuring with laid back heroes and fiesty female leads (Rachel Weisz), this is a great movie to check out. The cast is having lots of fun, the script packs in lots of good comedy bits and action setpieces, and the CG effects are handled well. They went a little overboard with the sequel and packed in too much of everything there, but this first installment is a nicely contained film.<br /><br />There are two editions, the regular collector's package and another 2-disc ultimate package. The ultimate set doesn't add that much except for commentaries and a look at the sequel (now useless), and also loses the isolated score bonus feature. This single disc can also be found in the Mummy 3-pack that collects all the movies together. Whichever version you pick, The Mummy is a solid adventure flick thats good for repeated viewings.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Nicholas Cage Seeing Two Minutes into the Future: Entertaining, But Not Great"></head><body><p>"Next" is an action film built on an intriguing sci-fi concept. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Cris Johnson, a Las Vegas "magician" who can see the future. Actually, he can see only two minutes into the future, but his uncanny ability would be still useful for some people, like an FBI agent played by Julianne Moore, chasing a group of terrorists who have smuggled a nuclear bomb into America.<br /><br />Yes, the film's story is implausible, full of plot holes and sometimes the "two-minutes-into-the-future" idea seems totally forgotten, but once action gets started, the film is entertaining. I really enjoyed watching Cage's hero evading dangers, running (or walking) away from guards hiding behind objects in a casino, or dodging numerous objects flying and falling (including a bullet) in the cliffside scene. One humorous scene has him trying to talk to his love interest, a beautiful teacher named Liz (played by Jessica Biel) that reminds us of "Groundhog Day."<br /><br />Unfortunately, Cris' romance turns out one of the weakest parts of the film. The heroine is too generic to make the love story interesting and though Nicolas Cage's character remains likeable and watchable, most characters in "Next" are colorless or given too short time to shine like Peter Falk's. We are not allowed to know even the motives or backgrounds of the terrorists. Special effects are not very impressive and some of them look hurriedly done.<br /><br />While watching the film, I was wondering: "Why didn't they use Julianne Moore's no-nonsense FBI agent as Cage's possible love interest, who is definitely a more interesting character than Biel's. You know this is not a masterpiece, but you will also find this film could have been much better, more thrilling with minor changes. Perhaps that is why some people (including me) didn't like the ending, which looks a bit abrupt.<br /><br />I'm not saying "Next" is a terrible film (especially after seeing "The Wicker Man," which it is.) But the film still needs more actions, more chemistry between Cage and Biel, and most of all, like "Ghost Rider," more original ways to make use of the hero's unique abilities.</p></body></html>

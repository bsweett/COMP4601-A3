<meta name="summary" content="An Extremely Powerful Motion Picture"></head><body><p>"Milk" is one of the best and most devastating movies I have seen in this decade. Harvey Milk is beautifully portrayed by Sean Penn in an absolutely flawless performance. The film is photographed with great sensitivity and power using some footage from the period. An activist who changed the gay world forever, Milk had a personal life that was severely challenged by his public political stands. The movie spends a great deal of time filling in the details of Milk as a person and a lover. It doesn't shirk from showing his erotic gay side.<br /> The movie makes him a martyr, but so was Martin Luther King, Gandhi and so were many others who defied contemporary morals and ethics. The film is very good at portraying the organization of political lieutenants that Milk built up. It makes Milk funny, vulnerable, driven, sympathetic, and has examples of the oratory he used to sway his advocates. If there is a villain in the piece it is Anita Bryant who had an agenda of prejudice and hate that motivated Milk and his allies. White, Milk's killer, is portrayed as a deeply troubled man who was predetermined by destiny to cut down his rival.<br /> The movie depicts the birth of the Castro in San Francisco as a gay area. Milk was one of the first merchants there with his camera store. He learned the power of organization by starting a gay owners' association which rivaled the straight merchants' groups.<br /> This film gives everything a sense of urgency and intensity which adds to its power. You feel as if you are living his life with him.<br /> For those who did not live through the Milk era this is a history lesson, but it also does a fine job of delineating any kind of political activist. It may seem to some as too sympathetic a portrayal, creating a picture of a man that was almost too "good" to be true but his failures in personal relationships and single-mindedness correct that view of a man without flaws. Sean Penn has, in a series of difficult roles, developed into a fine screen actor, versatile, protean, and capable of conveying great emotion and power. A superior movie.</p></body></html>

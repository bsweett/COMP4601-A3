<meta name="summary" content="Pleasantly Surprised...."></head><body><p>I honestly wasn't expecting much from this movie. The previews were just not that appealing. The storyline didn't seem to make any sense (from the previews.) I had no clue. (In more ways than one!)<br /><br />The fact is the movie was very smartly written. The animation was creative and very bright. It was realistic but abstract enough to be slightly amusing. The storyline is simple, but with a wide array of gags and "physical comedy" that entertains young and old alike. Of course, having said all that I must admit that the simple story is balanced by characters that are very complex in nature.<br /><br />Alex is the king of the jungle... only his jungle is the city zoo. Melman, the hypochondriac giraffe, along with lovely hippo, Gloria and Marty the laughable zebra make for an interesting zoo dynamic.<br /><br />Throw in a bunch of oddball penquins with military delusions and a gaggle of lemurs that like to "move it" and you have the screwball hit of the year!<br /><br />A perfect story for the kid in all of us.</p></body></html>

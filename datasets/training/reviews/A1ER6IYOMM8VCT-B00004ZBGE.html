I saw this film at the movies when it came out. That being said......I'm sorry folks, but this is not that good a movie! The first part is OK, but when they go "beneath" and once the religious hoopla starts, it is a complete snore fest! There is too much mumbo jumbo for this type of film and too quick a resolution! It is however essential to own, if you are going to watch the rest of the series. I am a fan of all the ape films, but this one is boring as H E L L in the middle! The DVD transfer is excellent on the new edition and 3 1/2 stars is generous.</p></body></html>

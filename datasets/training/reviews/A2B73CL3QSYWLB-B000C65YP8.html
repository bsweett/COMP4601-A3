I have been a big fan of Niccol's previous forays in paranoia.  "The Truman Show" and "Gattaca" are masterpieces.  Heck, I even liked "S.I.M.O.N.E".  Despite some bullseyes Niccol doesn't seem to focus his arguments here, therefore, he can't ratchet the sufficient outrage against the death merchants in our midst.  What redeems the film is Nicolas Cage's charasmatic turn as Yuri who enters into arms dealing as a lark and dicovers he's just so damned good at it.  A great scene in the film is where Yuri is stuck in an African village with a planeload of munnitions.  With Interpol on his tail he proceeds to empty out the contents of the plane by giving it away to the natives.  Not bad, but could have better.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="REALLY BOOORING..."></head><body><p>Failure to Launch was quite of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Matthew McConaughey, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Bates among others.<br /><br />A 35 year-old man's parents plot to have their son move out of the house (!) by hiring a professional who feigns interest in him...<br /><br />In short, the acting is generally pretty good (though nothing great), the setting is above average, while the dialogues and the plot are below average.<br /><br />The major setbacks are in relation to:<br /><br />1) The weak plot and especially the weak dialogues, for which the writers are to blame.  Matthew McConaughey, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Bates were given weak lines.  What a waste of a good cast!<br /><br />2) The whole "nephew" issue was just ridiculous!<br /><br />3) The whole naked father thing...<br /><br />4) Parents plotting to get rid of their child is absurd.<br /><br />On a positive note, Zooey Deschanel is delightful as Kit.  Let's see more of her...<br /><br />Though the potential for a decent movie was definitely there it fails to take off, primarily due to the writers.<br /><br />In a nutshell, it's a mediocre movie and that's about it.  Wait till they show it on TV.</p></body></html>

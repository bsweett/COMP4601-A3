Or at least this is what Aldington in a rather nasty biography would have us believe. Lawrence according to his own legend is meant to have helped he Arabs revolt against the Turks during the First World War, and thus lessen their ability to resist the British armies which moved up from Egypt to Syria. Aldington suggests that the Arabs did not become much involved in any military activity whatever and that what Lawrence wrote in his book the Seven Pillars of Wisdom was a lot of tall tales. Despite all of this the film although being a bit of pro Lawrence propaganda is one of the most brilliant visual spectaculars of all time. This was achieved long before the days of computer animation and without the use of models or any other tricks of the directors trade. It is best on the big screen with high quality speakers playing its remarkable sound track. The performances made the careers of the principle actors Peter O'Toole and Omar Shariff. Despite the fact that it is a very long film watching it one never has a moment of boredom and the time simply flies.</p></body></html>

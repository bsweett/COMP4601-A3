<meta name="summary" content="A truly dazzling look at a fictional truth..."></head><body><p>`The Last King of Scotland' opens almost childishly, kind of amateurish, as if it was going to make light of a very serious subject.  Almost immediately though it shifts gears and begins its gradual decline into darker waters, submersing the audience in the stirring madness that was the reign of Idi Amin.  Told through the eyes of fictitious character Dr. Nicholas Garrigan, `The Last King of Scotland' attempts to give the audience a ringside seat to the tragic events surrounding Amin's rise to power; and for the most part it succeeds very well.<br /><br />One must remember that this is not a true story.  It is a fictitious account of historical events.  You can liken it to `Titanic', for it is a fictional story woven around a foundation of actual events.<br /><br />The film opens with Scottish Doctor Nicholas Garrigan making his way to Uganda to help care for the sick villagers but is soon persuaded by the power behind Idi Amin (who has a soft spot for the Scottish) to leave his original plans and become Amin's personal physician.  This decision proved to be devastating for Garrigan, but that realization would come at a time that was almost too late for him.  As Garrigan becomes more knowledgeable of the truth behind Amin's reign, his initial admiration turns to disgust as he realizes the weight of the situation he now finds himself.  Garrigan finds himself acquainted with those in Amin's circle, including one of his wives named Kay with whom he starts a very dangerous relationship.<br /><br />The film is strengthened by the phenomenal performances by the two male leads, both Forest Whitaker and James McAvoy delivering career best performances.  Whitaker delves into the real man that is Idi Amin, the brutality festering beneath his surface always showing through in his eyes.  (His performance reminds me a bit of Yul Brenner's Oscar winning performance in `The King and I', a portrayal of a man savage by nature who tries to justify his actions with a fa?ade of kindness.  Yes, they are two different people in the end, but he similarities are obvious.)  His performance garnered him award after award (a sweep to be exact) and finally got him recognized among his peers.  His performance is extraordinary, but to be honest he is not as good as McAvoy who fleshes out Garrigan with expert precision, creating a character who is complete and real.  As Whitaker slips Amin into savagery, McAvoy is slowing peeling away Garrigan's sanity to unveil a man scarred by his surroundings and paralyzed by his newfound predicament.<br /><br />I was a little let down by Kerry Washington, not because her performance was lacking (it was quick good) but because the script didn't allow her to become someone truly real to us.  The film was so focused on Garrigan's relationship with Amin that it didn't take a few moments to really flesh out his relationship with Kay, and if it had then her performance would have seemed richer.  That is really the only fault I have with the script also, that it fails to fully invest itself in the entirety of Garrigan's surroundings, targeting his interactions with Amin and allowing the rest of the events around him to become mere side-points.  The film is not particularly long so it could have benefited from a few more minutes added to flesh out the entire plot.<br /><br />But, that is really just a small issue, not anything that should detract anyone from seeing this film.<br /><br />The final moments in `The Last King of Scotland' literally took my breath away (and single-handedly landed Whitaker his Oscar, when if the Academy would look at the less showy performance in the same scene they may have made a different choice).  It is in those moments that the entire film comes to a traumatic and emotionally rooted climax.  Many will see this film for Whitaker's lauded performance (as did I) but what you will find is a diamond in the rough; a truly outstanding fictional biopic that tantalizes every one of our senses.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="WORST MOVIE EVER MADE !  0 OUT OF 10"></head><body><p>Within the first few minutes of watching Happy Feet I was screaming it was so bad . This movie features the worst music ever, known as R&B. I wanted to go and impale myself on the nearest sharp object throughout the entire movie. The movie doesn't do anything to revitalize the movie industry, it's just another crappy animated movie like Chicken Little and Meet the Robinsons. No part of this movie was enjoyable and it felt like I was being mind-raped in my music and movie tastes section.Well,I didn't kill myself from the agony of this movie, but I better not go near any penguins because I now have the urge to beat the living crap out of a penguin for every bad penguin movie I see.</p></body></html>

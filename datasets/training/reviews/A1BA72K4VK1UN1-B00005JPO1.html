<meta name="summary" content="A sad last gasp of Hollywood senility (details)"></head><body><p>In the special features of this DVD, Steven Spielberg remarks that when Harrison Ford first ran the idea of a new Indiana Jones movie past him, he told the actor that he had *moved on* beyond this series of films. It would have been infinitely prudent had Spielberg remained steadfast in this profoundly clear assessment.<br /><br />I've seen better fight scenes in a 1930s B-western film... but I'm getting ahead of myself. The point is that Harrison Ford wasn't precisely a young man when he made his first three Indy films. And as this movie unfolds for the viewer, it becomes notably apparent that he was far too old and rickety to be making yet another in 2008. What in the world were they thinking about?!?<br /><br />This film is little more than a fairly heinous and unashamed re-write of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014Z4OMU">Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Special Edition)</a>, even to the point that the producers clung to the now-hackneyed John Williams *Raiders* theme/filmscore, with not the slightest hint of an update. In *Raiders* this soundtrack was uplifting and triumphant -- but here it comes off as dated and silly.<br /><br />In *Raiders* the stunts and events were just plausible if one allowed his or her imagination to joyfully stretch just a bit for the sake of completing the Hollywood magic... totally acceptable. In this instance, however, Indy survives unscathed a full nuclear blast by leaping into a 1950s vintage refrigerator. Through a repetition of similarly moronic gags, the film takes on the flavor of a *Bullwinkle* cartoon minus the great humor of the latter. These antics are openly slapstick but they suffer from clich&eacute; and familiarity and the overall story, a tenuous one at best, breaks down as a result.<br /><br />For me though, the greatest insult was to one of my favorite actors who was grossly mis-cast here into an inappropriate role: Cate Blanchett [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000654ZK0">The Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)</a>]. She plays a stereotypical ruthless Bondish-type Soviet scientist. Even though she yields a valiant effort, even she cannot surmount this witless dialogue and artless direction. Thus the role served only to diminish her sterling career.<br /><br />The film-makers also shamelessly re-introduced a wrinkled and aged *Marion Ravenwood* [played by Karen Allen]... unforgivable.<br /><br />No, this movie isn't exactly hateful. It just comes off as a lame idea and equally as Hollywood good-old-boy senility. It's clearly the worst idea that Lucas, Spielberg, and/or Ford ever spawned and represents a direct slap to the previous three Indy movies, all of which were really First-Class..<br /><br />WARNING! SPOILERS AHEAD! So, what does this yarn involve? Well, it's actually all about a discovery by one of Jones' associates of advanced aliens having invaded an ancient South American tribal culture -- but they don't call them aliens. The producers felt that it would be a superior approach to assert that these beings came from another *dimension*, even though the beings ultimately exit the planet in a flying saucer!<br /><br />The tale transpires in the 1950s and Indy (who discovers along the way that he has a grown son, vignettes of Captain Kirk in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000683DH">Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan - The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)</a>) faces the Red Menace of the Soviets rather than his former pre-World War Two nemeses -- but it's still the same story. Even *The Ark of the Covenant* garners a flash of a cameo appearance, (which is perhaps the only really humorous moment during the entire film.)<br /><br />I see that used copies of this DVD are being hawked for ninety-seven cents plus a fiver for shipping and handling on Amazon. Thus, I highly recommend that you check out your local public library's copy before you lay out that sort of cash for this slug of an action flick.</p></body></html>

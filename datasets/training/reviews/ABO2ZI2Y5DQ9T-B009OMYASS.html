Horror film fans know that there are a set of basic rules in the genre, and you will see `Hostel' is following them faithfully. That means, three backpackers, booze, women and some remote place no one has heard about before. There is nothing new or inventive about the premise, but it is only a starting point for the entire film, so that is alright with me.<br /><br />The most disappointing thing about `Hostel' for me is, however, that the film is not scary very much. The film seldom builds up the tension or the chills before the terrifying events that happen to each character. Things are set up in by-the-number way, never letting us imagine what is really going on in this quiet village in Slovakia.<br /><br />Instead, like his previous film `Cabin Fever' director Eli Roth shows lots of gores and tortures that are dreadful to see, and he is surely good at that. But if you ask me if there is something else that is particularly great about the film, I must say I could find none. The political subtext is cursory, and dark humor only falls flat.<br /><br />The film is "presented" by Quentin Tarantino who must have found something great in this film, but frankly I don't know what part of this film he liked so much as to give his name to it. But this is not the first time; anyone remembering the 1996 film `Curdled' (for which Tarantino served as executive producer) knows what I mean.<br /><br />One interesting thing is that Takashi Miike appears as cameo, an enigmatic businessman warning the protagonist Jay Fernandez to `be careful.' Perhaps this prolific director from Japan could have done a much better job, judging from his works like `Audition.' `Hostel' is after all not a terrible film. It is only passable, having nothing truly scary in it except,  you know, its gruesome torture.</p></body></html>

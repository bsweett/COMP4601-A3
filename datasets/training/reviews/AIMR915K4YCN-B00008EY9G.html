IDENTITY is a movie w/ loads of secrets and twisty surprises. The action grows increasingly odd and ultimately turns completely illogical. In the end, we find that this is necessary to the story. John Cusack, Ray Liotta, and Amanda Peet play the central characters. The rest of the cast is equally awesome, w/ Rebecca DeMornay (The Hand That Rocks The Cradle), Clea Duval (How To Make A Monster), Alfred Molina (Species), and Jake Busey (The Frighteners, Starship Troopers) among them! There's a cop, a convict, a chauffeur, a has-been movie star, a hooker, a family, a young couple, and Larry, the jittery desk-clerk. None of these people are who or what they appear to be. Many secrets will be revealed. Many will die. This all culminates in a mindf'ing final twist that will pry your jaw open! Highly recommended...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I will find you. And I will kill you."></head><body><p>"Taken" is essentially two lines of dialogue - "I will find you. And I will kill you." - stretched out into a 90-minute film. The speaker of this line finds his man. And, boy, does he kill him. And then he finds more people and kills them, too. And before he found the guy he was looking for in the first place, he found some other guys. Guess what? He killed them.<br /><br />This is not a subtle film. It's not all that bloody, either, this tale of a CIA agent (Liam Neeson) whose estranged daughter (Maggie Grace) is kidnapped by sex trade smugglers, thanks to a PG-13 rating. But nuanced? No. Luc Besson ("The Fifth Element," "The Professional," The "Transporter" series), who co-wrote the screenplay and more or less breathed life into this thing as producer likes his action scenes big, and his hit men sentimental-yet-efficient.<br /><br />And Neeson's character, Bryan Mills, is certainly that. He's divorced from his wife (Famke Janssen) for logging too many hours in hot zones for the CIA, and since she's remarried to, of course, a billionaire (Xander Berkeley, not the villain, if you're guessing), Bryan has idealized his gangly, selfish daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), and transformed her into his Reason For Living.<br /><br />But Kim cons him into signing a release so she can go to Paris with her slightly older, sluttier friend. It's only Bryan's zeal for worrying about every little detail - she forgets to call him upon landing in France, so he calls her - that allows him to hear his daughter getting kidnapped by Albanian slave traders.<br /><br />Inexplicably, her kidnapper picks up the phone. That's enough for Brian and his connections at the CIA to start the manhunt.<br /><br />The second and third acts of "Taken" are, frankly, one mass killing after another, each unlikelier than the last. In the background, we see the pale, starving figures - some alive, some not - of other kidnapped girls. At one point, Bryan looks for his daughter in what appears to be a giant Port-A-Potty divided into tiny rooms by cloth curtains with a bed, a slave and a client in each. Bryan eventually finds the Albanians' home base, which is a hive of, well, drugged-out women and presumed venereal disease.<br /><br />The movie is structured almost like a video game, with a number of bosses to kill and levels to complete. Brian's most daunting challenges lie in the bowels of a Paris brownstone at a million-dollar auction and aboard a ship headed for the Middle East. Whether Maggie is there, and whether he saves her, I'll let the film reveal.<br /><br />Let it be said that Maggie Grace, a veteran of the "Lost" TV series, was 25 years old when she filmed the movie. She's lost any useful clue on how to play an innocent 17-year-old, and thus turns in one of the more embarrassing performances of the year. There is a way to pout - Kim is required to do it in just about every scene - and a way not to, and it's a mark of Grace's inelegance that she never carves out an ounce of chemistry with Neeson, whose Bryan is risking more than his life, his moral compass and years in prison to save her.  And, unfortunately, she is also not cute, as a scene near the end so drastically points out. You'll know the one, and you'll be asking yourself, "Her?"<br /><br />Neeson slips nicely into the role once given to Harrison Ford. His Bryan is sharp and ruthless, and the movie's key "find you/kill you" monologue is delivered with menace and precision. You'll want to watch it twice. Janssen and Berkeley have bit roles, as does the excellent Leland Orser as one of Brian's CIA buddies.<br /><br />A subplot involving a pop singer is so extraneous and unnecessary that I think it exists to be extraneous and unnecessary, as if to show the audience a modicum of 1980s decency. Everything in "Taken" - the Eurotrash baddies, the body count, the "heart's on fire" hero of steely resolve but pudding heart - feels stolen from 1986. In other words - good for a pizza night.</p></body></html>

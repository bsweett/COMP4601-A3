<meta name="summary" content="A visceral meditation on faith"></head><body><p>Having seen the original "Exorcist" about a million times, I wasn't expecting much; a few more spasms of pea soup, some more foul language from the smartass demon we all know and love, or maybe Father Merrin going to the pharmacy and getting some heart medication that ACTUALLY WORKS.<br /><br />But "The Version You've Never Seen" defied all my expectations and then some.  This is better than the original, infinitely better, and I don't say that lightly. It transforms that classic 1973 shockfest/bleak tale of an innocent young girl defiled by forces beyond science and beyond the most extreme of human assistance into a subtle masterpiece which transcends horror and most so called "religious" films in general.<br /><br />The story is the same but recounted in a manner which is somehow entirely different from Friedkin's original cut: there is a meditative silence to the quietly catastrophic events which put a girl's life in danger and bring two men who barely know each other together to help her:the scene in the doctor's office, when Regan is being given a series of medical/psychological tests, answer in no uncertain terms the question of whether she was possessed or not.  The face that appears momentarily speaks for itself.<br /><br />Father Karras' personal crisis with the insanity and death of his mother and his reaction to it is dramatically altered by the beautifully restored scenes in which he says mass: in the original, he looks from the altar and sees people weeping, broken.  In this version, Miller's character is beginning to realize that Regan is actually possessed and his faith is being strengthened by this new catastrophe, not weakened.  The spiderwalk scene is appropriately foul; it shows that the horror living inside of Regan will not be restricted to her bedroom forever.<br /><br />The images which are spliced within the film are not hoky at all but on the contrary make it more frightening: the ill-fated hypnotist with a serious case of blueballs gets a momentary glimpse of what he is dealing with before Regan chokes the chicken.  The sense of ultimate mystery--an aging Jesuit priest finding an unpleasant relic in Iraq, a tortured young priest who is ready to pack it in and leave the priesthood, the little daughter of a rich and lively actress in Georgetown, and the coagulation of these forces into a disastrous but successful final confrontation--it is all done to better effect here.<br /><br />There is something deeply, deeply disturbing about this movie; while certainly not the "scariest movie of all time", it is a visceral assault on the senses filled with a strange voodoo subliminal power that does not make for casual viewing.  Unless one is absolutely steeled to whatever one sees, and even then, this will scare the hell out of you, no pun intended.  One of the best horror movies ever made and thought provoking about the most important questions in our lives.</p></body></html>

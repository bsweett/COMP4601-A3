<meta name="summary" content="Not Great but very entertaining"></head><body><p>This movie is not as good as the original Alien or Predator but it is entertaining from start to finish nevertheless. A large corporation detects a pyramid under 2,000 feet of ice in Antarctica and assembles a team to explore it.<br /><br />The company is headed up by a mega millionaire, played by the same actor who was the android in the first two Alien movies. The star of the team is a mountain climber who is an expert in climbing ice walls. She is joined by a bunch of experts including an archeologist whose biggest prize seems to have been a Pepsi bottle cap found at one of his digs and another one who seems to only be interested in taking digital pictures.<br /><br />When the group arrives at the site they discover a hole has already been mysteriously burned into the ice all the way down to the pyramid. Rather than take time to assess the situation they head with reckless abandon down the hole to the pyramid.<br /><br />The pyramid seems to be a combination of Egyptian, Aztec, and Asian culture. Also, there are carvings of Predators and Aliens and a warning that only those who are "worthy" may enter. The pyramid has other surprises such as moving walls that cause the pyramid to rearrange itself every 10 minutes so its tunnel system is always different.<br /><br />As everyone knows that has seen the trailer, the pyramid is a training ground for Predator's to hone their skills by battling Aliens. Of course the humans start getting wiped out, first by invisible Predators and then by Aliens that want to drag them back to the Alien nest to implant Alien hosts in their bodies.<br /><br />The movie seems to waste no time in introduction and we seem to get to the action immediately. If you can ignore some of the downsides such as why the Predators don't use their invisibility against the Aliens, why the people are in the frigid Antarctica but have no visible breath, why they seem to be outside in the frigid cold sometimes without a jacket and not be cold, how they can be there with fingerless gloves and not have their fingers freeze, also the movie gives no explanation how whoever survives at the end will get back to civilization considering they are about 1,000 miles away from it.</p></body></html>

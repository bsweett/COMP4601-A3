<meta name="summary" content=""Citizen Kane" on steroids"></head><body><p>"There Will Be Blood" is an excellent example of what a director can do when he grafts together epic literary tales ("King Lear", "Oedipus Rex") and compacts them into one tragic tale.  Paul Thomas Anderson must have had a lot of fun (maybe) skimming the proverbial froth from innumerable tales of the tragic "great" man and transforming them into this tour de force of tragedy.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis deserves an award for his performance as this hollow, ambitious and sadistic man who arrives on the scene with no origin.  He doesn't talk; he growls.  He doesn't walk; ravages the land he walks on with a proud aggression.  He wants money and he wants oil.<br /><br />This brings him into conflict with perhaps the most despicable character in the film (yes, more despicable than Plainview): the Preacher Eli.  A narcissistic, money hungry con artist who even physically resembles a snake, his heart does not reside in Logos or Divine Truth but in money.  One thing I did not like about this film at all was the constant mockery of the mere idea of God's existence--because there's one fraud playing a huge part in the film, Anderson has to engage in cliched Starbucks cinematic modernity?  (Which is one of the reasons "No Country For Old Men" is a better film: it is not about the madness of one titanic figure, it is about fate and the ultimate).<br /><br />Plainview, for all his considerable business skills, is essentially a demented and angry misanthrope.  I'd disagree with reviewers (Roger Ebert being one of them) who saw no mercy in this guy.  He seems to care very much for his son H.W. until the end, until all the betrayals real and imagined have occured.  I had to laugh a few times when Plainview flips out, at one point telling a member of Standard Oil that he was going to "visit him at his home and cut his throat in the middle of the night": all the guy did was suggest that, as a millionaire, he could devote more of his time to his son.  His spontaneous convulsions of rage are both amusing and horrifying.<br /><br />I expected something to change in Plainview's fate midway through the movie for some reason.  It never did.  Things get worse and worse until he is finally worse off, even, than Charles Foster Kane.  And more dangerous.<br /><br />A finely crafted movie.  Definitely destined to become a cult classic.</p></body></html>

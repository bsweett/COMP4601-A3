<meta name="summary" content="Underwritten"></head><body><p>With their stunning visuals and apparent innocence, it's easy to forget that animated films are among the most tightly constructed and painstakingly written movies ever made: the writers have 80 pages to tell a universally appealing character-based tale which not only has a suitable "moral" for a child audience, but is also edge-of-the-seat engaging, includes at least one tear-jerking moment, and is laugh-out-loud funny to the extent of more than three jokes per page.  When it works, it really works: "Toy Story" (1 and 2), "Ice Age", "Finding Nemo" and "The Lion King".  When it doesn't work, as is the case here, it's all too obvious.  "Madagascar" takes far too long to get to where we all know it's going, and when it gets there very little happens.  The "friendship vs. instinct" theme is superficially explored in the character of Alex the Lion, but it isn't sufficiently connected to the rest of the story.  What's missing is a strong villain, and a point: sure our four friends want to get home, but there isn't much they can - or do - actually do about it, is there?  Fortunately, "Madagascar" is almost saved by the strength of the vocal performances - Sacha Baron Cohen, as King Julien in particular - and the antics of the minor characters.  The lemurs and the penguins save the day, in more ways than one.  There are some neat parodies of other movies - referencing everything from "American Beauty" to "The Mission" - but overall this lacks that elusive mix of wit, heart and good old-fashioned storytelling that distinguishes the best in the genre.</p></body></html>

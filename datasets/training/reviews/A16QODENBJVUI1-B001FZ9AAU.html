As a rule, I think this is more helpful than focusing on features, extras, packaging, and such.  Because these change and usually (though not always) Amazon links the old versions to the new, comments about these can become irrelevant.  I am making an exception to this product, the Blu-ray 2-disc edition of IRON MAN, simply because it is the first movie that I bought on Blu-ray.  I previously had bought two TV series on Blu-ray, but this is the first film.<br /><br />I recently purchased a Sony Playstation 3, primarily for watching movies, though secondarily for playing games.  I limiting my Blu-ray purchases until the prices for the discs come down to around the same level as DVDs.  On the other hand, I'm virtually cutting out my purchases of DVDs entirely, since the new format is already on hand.  I wouldn't be surprised if overall DVD sales started to drop if more people follow the kinds of buying patterns I'm currently practicing.  We are in an in between period.  The format war is over and Blu-ray has won, but not enough people own Blu-ray players because they are priced too high.  But just as I stopped purchasing LPs and cassette tapes once CDs were released, so I'm ceasing buying DVDs.  But my purchasing of Blu-ray is minimal.  Mostly I rent from Netflix.<br /><br />Which leads to the question, why buy Blu-ray at all?  Well, only if there is enough in the product to justify it.  In the case of IRON MAN, I believe what you get justifies the cost.  I was a little nervous the first time I put a Blu-ray on, wondering if the difference was going to justify the money I had expended.  I'm delighted to say that it did.  The main feature, of course, looks extraordinary.  But IRON MAN is unique in contrast with the other Blu-ray films and series that I have watched in the format in the amount of extras also in 1080 high-def.  I think this will change quickly as Blu-ray matures as a form, but currently many releases have the main feature in 1080 high def, but many of the features in a lower resolution.<br /><br />IRON MAN also has an amazing number of special features that I actually enjoyed watching.  Too often special features just seem to be filler, put there to make the purchaser that there is more to the item purchased than there is.  And frankly, more often than not I don't bother with special features at all.  But I find projects like IRON MAN to be quite fascinating, since it involves combining several technologies to create the final main character, including the main actor, stunt doubles, high tech suits, robots, and extensive CGI.  Frankly, going behind the scenes of most movies -- even most very good movies -- is not terribly interesting.  But in the case of a high-tech super hero movies, it is very nearly as much fun as the main feature itself.  I especially enjoyed the series of short features documenting the making of the film.  I find that I enjoyed the movies itself more fully on rewatching than I did the first time through.<br /><br />IRON MAN is important not merely for being a very good movie, but for being the first movie by a new studio that is certain to be among the greatest producer of box office smashes in the next decade.  After watching several Marvel characters drive some of the greatest box office hits of the past decade, Marvel has established its own production company.  The goal is ultimately an Avengers movie and to that end they are bringing out a string of movies over the next 3 or 4 years, introducing potential new members of the Marvel answer to the JLA.  We have already been introduced to Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, and Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. (and I hope everyone who has watched IRON MAN stuck around after the closing credits to be introduced to Nick Fury, who gets his own movie something early in the next decade -- this will almost certain star Samuel L. Jackson, who gave his permission to serve as the model for Fury in The Ultimate Nick Fury comic release).  Marvel has announced movies based on Thor, Captain America, and Ant-Man, all of whom were members of the Avengers in one or another version, along with Iron Man and the Hulk.  Marvel's formula, based on IRON MAN and THE INCREDIBLE HULK, as well as the movies they are striving to cast (the word is that Daniel Craig recently turned down the offer to star in THOR), is to make a character based film focused primarily on a high-profile actor (Robert Downey Jr., Edward Norton, and if he had taken the offer Daniel Craig), and then build the action around him, instead of having the character as an afterthought to the action.  It has worked wonderfully in the Spider-Man movies (which was primarily a Sony production).  When and if they do an Avengers movie, the cost of the cast alone should be jaw dropping.  However, Marvel isn't focusing on the Avengers alone.  They have also announced their intention to do a film based on my own favorite Marvel series, Brian K. Vaughan's The Runaways, about a group of empowered teens in California who discover that their parents are super villains, causing them to become runaways (hence their name).  Though the Runaways have been tangentially included in Marvel Big Events like the Civil War and the Secret Invasion, they aren't centrally involved in the rest of the Marvel Universe.  There will also be a Silver Surfer film, hopefully with Galactus as his foe.<br /><br />My fear is that Marvel is going to be exclusively focused on producing titanic box office smashes.  Though I will add that both IRON MAN and THE INCREDIBLE HULK focus on character enough to make both far more than cinematic comic books.<br /><br />My last comment is that as a Robert Downey Jr. admirer, I couldn't be happier that he seems to have conquered his personal demons to enjoy the greatest commercial success of his career.  He is a first rate actor who has been in many, many fine movies over the years, often in independent productions, but for a while it looked like his career might be over.  Although he proudly points out that even during the years when he struggled with drug addiction and never missed a single day of shooting on any film, after his final rehab and jail stint insurers would not insure his films.  I know that Woody Allen had to drop him from one project because they couldn't get insurance for him.  Gradually, however, he managed to work his way back.  He is especially good to see in this role because his own personal problems parallel those of Tony Stark in the comics.  Like Downey earlier in his life, Tony Stark struggles with alcoholism.  The film only shows him drinking.  I wonder if IRON MAN 2, which was just announced, will show Stark dealing with his drinking.  I hope so.  It has been the focus on things like this that have made several of the Marvel movies so enjoyable.  Although there is great action, ultimately they are about believable, very human individuals who become heroes.  The more human you make the characters, the more delightful they become as heroes.</p></body></html>

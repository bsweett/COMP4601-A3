A passenger is seasick. They both smoke. [No FDA warnings?] The island is a prison for the criminally insane. There was a fort from the Civil War time, now used for the most dangerous prisoners. The two Federal Marshals are there to search for a fugitive. Dr. Cauley made this a unique institution. Rachel Salender escaped last night. She is a war widow who murdered her three children but believes they are still alive. How did she escape from a locked room? The guards are questioned as a group about Rachel. Her primary doctor left the island in the morning. The talk in Dr. Cauley's apartment drags. No cooperation? Teddy Daniels has dreams of the past (a nightmare?). Should patients get lobotomies [never proven to work] or doses of thorazine to make them tranquil?<br /><br />Patients are interviewed. [Is this believable?] Is this for comedy or satire? What kind of glass does Mrs. Kearns drink from? We learn why Teddy Daniels chose this case. Where did Andrew Laytes disappear to? The storm blows down trees. Daniels recalls his past in the war at Dachau. [Were those guards really shot after they surrendered?] Daniels tells about George Noyce and how he was put in Ashcliff. Can he be believed? [Daniels trusts his co-worker.] Is there a ruse to put them there? Rachel was found. They talk to her, she acts crazy. Teddy has a migraine, and more dreams. [The film begins to drag again.] A scream starts a new dream. "See!" Teddy dreams of his wife again. Then they visit Ward C, the oldest and most dangerous ward.<br /><br />Andrew pops up for a dramatic surprise. There is a fight. A guard shows up. Teddy wanders off, and finds George Noyce. "They knew." [The film starts to drag again.] Is the story credible? What is happening on this island? Teddy wants to see the lighthouse. [Wouldn't a lighthouse be located on the top of that island? Would Teddy climb down those slippery rocks? The real Rachel Salender is hiding in a cave. [Food and water?] She asked about sodium amytal shipments and lobotomies. Could patients be brainwashed into automatons? "Any funny dreams or trouble sleeping?" [Is this the message of this movie?] "You'll never leave here" says Rachel. The guard says "God loves violence". Teddy was wandering.<br /><br />Dr. Cauley tells Teddy he had no partner. A doctor meets Teddy. "Don't go, Teddy." Hallucinations? [Swimming in ice cold water?] Guards with rifles? Teddy climbs the stairs to the top of the lighthouse. Chloropromazine for the past 24 months? [Can you believe the ending? Isn't it too incredible?] "We're telling you the truth." There is another flashback to years earlier that explains it all. Or does it? [Unbelievable?] Just when you think this film can't get any worse a shot is fired. Then we are back to the present to hear the confession. "We're too smart for them." So Teddy goes for a walk.<br /><br />This movie didn't fool the people, audiences stayed away from it after the first week. Was this the worst film since "The Runaway Jury" or "The Blair Witch Project"? This is a first rate production of a third-rate story. Should the director retire already?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="1984&Brave New World meet Coma and end with Logan's Run"></head><body><p>This is a pretty entertaining movie.  I think it will make some who are all for cloning and its attendant technologies a bit squeamish, but that is part of its purpose, just as the 1978 movie "Coma" raised similar questions for transplants.  The movie has basically two very different parts.  One is a kind of scifi mood piece and the other is an extremely hyper (even preposterous) action flick.  Does it work?  Well, as I say, I found it enjoyable, but not enlightening.<br /><br />If you think of the movie as opening with a kind of 1984 - Brave New World that then transitions with Coma and then finishes with an adrenaline fueled Logan's Run, well, that is about it.  It is well done for what it is and has a couple of touching moments.  However, they are hard to feel because they are small cupfuls within barrels of crashbangboom.<br /><br />So, if you just enjoy it for what it is and, sad to say, don't think too much, you can have fun with this movie.</p></body></html>

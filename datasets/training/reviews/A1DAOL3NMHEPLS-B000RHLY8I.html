<meta name="summary" content="Passable pseudo-documentary mixed with deadpan humor"></head><body><p>An interesting but often slow-moving film that chronicles the exploits of a fictitious international arms dealer over a period of two decades.  It is supposedly "based on true events," and probably is -- but it's hard to believe all of those events occurred in one man's experience.  The "message" (international arms trade is bad) is delivered in a fairly heavy-handed manner, but there are occasional moments of dark humor to keep the movie from becoming too preachy.<br /><br />The production is good, if you like deliberately flat and muted photography. Cage does a decent job as the protagonist/narrator, although I found the voice-over narration tiresome after a while. The overall consensus rating of 3.5 stars is about right; I went with three stars because half-star ratings are not allowed on Amazon and I think this is slightly closer to being a 3-star entry than a 4-star.</p></body></html>

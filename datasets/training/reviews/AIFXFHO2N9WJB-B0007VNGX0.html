Though critics and even some moviegoers didn't feel the movie was worthy of receiving a sequel, even though the ending was left wide open and a sequel was needed for some sort of resolution to the story, the studio execs were clearly listening to those that enjoyed the movie and decided to buck the critics and released "Resident Evil:  Apocalypse".  The same people that despised the first film were bashing the release of its sequel with just as much passion; however, upon it's release the film managed to silence many of its attackers.  Not settling for merely making a sequel for money alone, writer Paul W. S. Anderson (the writer/director of "Resident Evil") crafted an even bigger, better, and more action packed thriller for the follow-up, and succinctly silenced the nay-sayers with a sequel that ties up all loose ends from the original film, serving as an excellent addition to a budding franchise.<br /><br />"Resident Evil:  Apocalypse" begins directly where "Resident Evil" left off, starting with a flashback sequence that serves as a refresher course for the audience so that all are on the same page when the action really gets going.  Surviving the zombie attacks in the underground compound of the Umbrella Corporation, Alice (Milla Jovovich) arrives in Raccoon City, located right next to the compound, and discovers that she is too late.  The entire city has apparently been overrun by zombies, with most of the city in ruins, Alice begins searching for any non-infected survivors.  She finds a few companions that are willing to take the fight to the zombies, Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) and Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr), well-armed and ready for action these compatriots set out to rid Raccoon City of the evil unleashed by Umbrella Corporation.  However, Umbrella Corp. has a surprise for our heroes, a nasty mutated form of zombie known as Nemesis.  With supplies becoming drastically limited, it appears that time is running out for our heroes, and humanity's days could be numbered.<br /><br />As I stated earlier, "Resident Evil:  Apocalypse" is simply a better film than its predeccesor, in terms of acting, storytelling, pacing, and action.  To be fair, "Resident Evil" is merely the opening chapter to this much bigger story that is told in "Resident Evil:  Apocalypse", and in truth, neither of the two films hold up on their own.  Director Alexander Witt brings his valuable experience as a much respected 2nd Unit Director from his previous film experiences, "Gladiator" and "The Bourne Identity" to name a couple, giving the material a more mature, polished appearance that the original film lacked.  The special effects, including the practical and make-up effects, are all improved in "Resident Evil:  Apocalypse".  A very good decision was made in having the Nemesis monster not be just another CGI character, but be a physical man in a suit, it is with the Nemesis character that the make-up and practical effects team really shined.  The acting and storytelling were much improved from the original film, and the addition of Jill Valentine and Carlos Olivera from the video games was an especially nice touch.<br /><br />Overall, "Resident Evil:  Apocalypse" is a very solid, zombie thriller that doesn't stand up well on it's own, but when coupled with the first film, the two make for a very entertaining thrill ride of zombie mayhem.<br /><br />"Resident Evil:  Apocalypse" is rated R for violence, language, and nudity.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="great film"></head><body><p>Mr. Brooks is an interesting suspense about a man who takes pleasure in killing other people.  Along the way, or rather, after the first killing that we see in the movie, he meets someone who's apparently a photographer.<br /><br />The guy happened to take a picture of the killer shooting a couple... um... "doing it" in a bedroom.  He even positioned the bodies in a sick sexual way after killing them so the cops would see the bodies in that position when they arrived to the scene.<br /><br />The story gets interesting when the killer meets the guy who snapped the picture of him in the middle of the killing, because it turns out the photographer doesn't have ANY plans to turn the killer in after showing him pictures of the killing he just committed.  Instead, the photographer actually wants to go with the killer on his next "kill job".<br /><br />So the killer and the photographer go around town searching for the next victim.  This takes up a good portion of the movie, building suspense the entire time.<br /><br />This movie is great because it builds suspense and shows you what's it like to get inside the head of someone who has no compassion for human life.  The entire film focuses on the killer having a make-believe friend helping to convince him go through with the killings.  The invisible friend is just the voice in his head.<br /><br />Also, the killers daughter plays a big part in the film with some neat twists you won't see coming.<br /><br />Anyway, when the story gets going, the movie turns into a really solid film overall.  I recommend this film to just about anyone interested in violent movies.</p></body></html>

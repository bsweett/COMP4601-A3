<meta name="summary" content="Can Pixar do anything wrong???"></head><body><p>My answer would be no.<br />Movie after movie is brilliant, innovative, imaginative, beautiful.<br />The animation is awesome.<br />The voices are spot on.<br />I wish Disney would take a closer look at why Pixar is so successful.<br />No annoying characters, and no annoying songs every five seconds.<br />Pixar movies are for everyone, not just the kids.<br />Monsters is probably my favorite still.<br />The story is so good, I don't even know how many times I've seen this.<br />The ending pulls at the old heartstrings.<br />I recommend this along with EVERY movie Pixar has done.<br />For kids, for adults.<br />If I could give this movie ten stars, I would.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Technicolor Costuming & Set Design"></head><body><p>I loved the costuming, make-up, set design, & cinematography as a whole as it was all very well done throughout the entire movie.<br /><br />The acting was so-so.... The rock music sucked entirely as it didn't go at all with this period piece.<br /><br />The storyline was understated throughout this movie only touching lightly on various important themes/topics involving Marie Antoinette and her life, while vaguely touching upon her role and placement in France as Queen.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this movie the high marks, is due to the positive features I mentioned at the start of this review. Otherwise this movie version about the life of Marie Antoinette sucked.</p></body></html>

This film is nearly as good, though with much less suspense, and a whole lot more action.<br /><br />I won't sit here and tell you that this is better than the original, or even as good, but it comes pretty darn close.<br /><br />I would NOT say that character developement lacked. On top of the first movie, this film had just what it needed. What would films be like without characters like these? We have Jonathan, the comedy relief, Rick, the hero who doubles as comedy relief and Evie, the hero's wife who plays an adventerous role. The others are great too.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is a must see.</p></body></html>

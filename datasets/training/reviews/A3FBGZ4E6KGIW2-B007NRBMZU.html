I didn't hear or read any criticism, so I went into the movie with an open mind and lots of hope that this would be a movie that I would enjoy.  I was very wrong.  I was disturbed by parts (and I've seen some very disturbing movies, but this was just too much for me) and I was also bored halfway through the film.  I saw about half and didn't watch the other half.  I also couldn't stand all the switching screens all the time, I was losing my train of thought as to what was actually happening.  I love 'psychological thrillers' as I would call this movie, but this..this was just not what I expected.  At all.  It almost makes me wonder if everyone was watching the same movie as I was.  But I guess they were.  Maybe you'll have to see it for yourself, but for me, I'll pass.</p></body></html>

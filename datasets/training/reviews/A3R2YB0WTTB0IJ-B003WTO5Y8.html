This point of view is so personal and is so depending  on your peculiar history that it cannot be relevant here. I'm not able to  tell you that the movie will frighten you a little bit, a lot or not at  all. I really don't know, that's it. And after all, who cares ?<p>As  always, the quality of the movie depends on what the director or, less  often, the screenplay writer has hidden behind the images shown and the  words spoken. Of course, the effort required from you is easier if you are  watching a Woody Allen movie because the quality of the dialogs has  sharpened your mind and you're not distracted by multiple car crashes or  noisy explosions. In the case of an atmospheric thriller like THE SILENCE  OF THE LAMBS, the nervous tension of your body due to the suspense of the  movie is certainly going to prevent you to discover all the secrets of the  film.<p>OK ! I'm not your schoolteacher, so I'm only going to give you a  hint or a key which, at least I hope so, will arouse your envy to watch THE  SILENCE OF THE LAMBS a second time. In numerous works of writers or film  directors, the theme of - The House - is often treated as a metaphor for  the human mind so why not have the courage to visit once again the house of  the serial killer and especially its cellar with the enormous superficies  lying under the basement. Good luck !<p>A DVD for your library.</p></body></html>

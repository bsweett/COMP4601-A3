<meta name="summary" content="Thought provoking film of Alan Moore's graphic novel of a man with no fear"></head><body><p>First the plot--Imagine "Batman Begins" with the Liam Neeson character as the hero crossed with "The Phantom of the Opera" with a twist of 1984 thrown in for good measure and you've got an idea of the film "V for Vendetta". V (Hugo Weaving)is bound and determined for justice and that includes taking down the government of a man (John Hurt)who has turned England into a God fearing police state. V is on a time table to undo this government as the government is looking for him. In a TV broadcast he tells England he will take out the House of Paraliment by November 5th (Guy Fawkes Day in England)and asks the population to show their support by being there when he does it. The film though turns on the relationship between V and Evey (Natalie Portman)the daughter of two revolutionaries put to death by the government when she was a child. She represents us as she observes V and slowly comes to understand his madness. When she is saved by V from rape by members of the government she is thrown into a world she can no longer make heads nor tails of. Clearly this film isn't going to be for everyone and fans of Alan Moore's graphic novel will probably be disappointed. No matter the film manages to tell a gripping story for a mainstream Hollywood release. This isn't "The Matrix" nor is it "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen". It's better than the Matrix sequels but not quite as great as I'd hoped. It's still an entertaining film. It's clear by the vote count here that somehow I've been unhelpful. I'm not quite sure what folks were looking for here but this film did appeal to me even if it wasn't perfect.<br /><br />V may be a bit naive (when he takes out the government he believes that the people will take back power and the government will fear them instead of the people fearing the government)he's also a fascinating mixture of vigilante, hero and villan. Stylishly directed by James McTeigue (assistant director of "The Matrix" here helming his first film)with beautiful cinematography by the late Adrian Bittle ("The World is Not Enough", "Aliens" and "Thelma & Louise")"V for Vendetta" may not perfectly capture Alan Moore and David Lloyd's graphic novel but it certainly captures the spirit of it. Written as a protest against Thatcher and her government policies, "V for Vendetta" works amazingly well in this adaptation by "The Matrix" writers Andy Wachowski and Larry Wachowski. Featuring stunning performances and great support work particularly by Hugo Weaving, Natalie Portman, Stephen Rea, Stephen Fry, John Hurt, Tim Pigoett-Smith and Rupert Graves "V for Vendetta" takes a lot of risks for a mainstream Hollywood movie in the post 9/11 world we live in but it's points are intelligent and well worth noting.</p></body></html>

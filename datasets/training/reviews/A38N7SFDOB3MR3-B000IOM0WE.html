<meta name="summary" content="Suprisingly Entertaining. 64 out of 100."></head><body><p>After about 10 minutes into Aeon Flux, I wasn't sure whether I was going to like the film. For the next 20 minutes, you could say "I strandled the fence" between liking it and turning it off. There were occasional hints that Aeon Flux would fall over to the cheesy side of the fence, but it didn't. By the end of the movie, I was in love with the story, characters, action, and its twists and turns. This is a must see for sci-fi/fantasy fans. Those outside this realm might not care for Aeon Flux. I will buy the DVD for this movie. My lower ratings for "must buy" reflect the fact that non-sci-fi fans might not care for Aeon Flux.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 64<br /><br />29 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />6 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?<br /><br />8 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?<br /><br />9 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace. Is the movie forgettable, or something you will talk about and remember for weeks? Years?<br /><br />7 (out of 10). Must see. Is this movie worth seeing/renting?<br /><br />5 (out of 10). Must buy. Is this movie a must buy/purchase?</p></body></html>

Milla Jovovich (Resident Evil) is back once again doing what she does best, terminate evil.<br /><br />Set far into the future, after most of mankind has been wiped out by a devastating biological holocaust those that remain have been divided into two warring camps, humans and hemophages. The hemophages are comprised of humans who have been infected by a virius that bestows vampire-like physical attributes and physical abilities, but also accelerates the aging process. Ultraviolet is the most deadly hemophage assassin who has been sent on a mission that will change the balance of power forever if successful. That is if she decides to complete the assignment as originally planned.<br /><br />Yes the storyline does lack substance but there is so much non-stop action in this film there really isn't much room between fight scenes to fit one in. The special effects are definitely not the best I've ever seen, but passable. As for Milla, she says it herself, "I'm a Titan, a monolith. Nothing can stop me." She's absolutely right!</p></body></html>

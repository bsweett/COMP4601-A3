<meta name="summary" content="This is a pinchy movie, ese."></head><body><p>I am disedified that this movie is well regarded.  As storytelling, it gets an F-.  The family that Robin Williams gets a little obsessed with?  The father is some yuppie flake who's got about the same presence as a guy in a dandruff commercial.  The wife seems to have read a book that says the secret to great dramatic acting is to act like you're on downers all the time and can't bring yourself to wake up.  "Where is your son!"  The detective yells in her face, once its become clear that jeopardizing shenanigans are afoot.  She blinks and slowly shakes her head and says in a voice devoid of emotion, "He's... at a friend's house..."  The kid himself, who all the fuss is about is basically just a kid, who commands about as much interest as most kids - zero.  Robin Williams doesn't have sexual designs on the kid.  He doesn't have sexual designs on the mother, and though he does end up taking some - shall we say, artistic? - photos, he doesn't have sexual designs on the father.  So what is his angle?  Well, suffice it to say that his own family was not so hot, so he's become a trifle obsessed with what he sees as the perfect family.  Maybe its part of the whole idea that the family he does get obsessed with is nothing to write home about and in fact makes the viewer vaguely nauseous.  Maybe, as in Taxi Driver, what the misguided protagonist sees and what is really there are two different things.  Maybe you are supposed to want to puke on these people and hope that Robin Williams cuts them up real bad with his stilletto, homes.  Maybe.</p></body></html>

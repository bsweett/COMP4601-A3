<meta name="summary" content="Sniper On Line One"></head><body><p>Oh, yeah.  It's been awhile since I've watched a white-knuckle thriller--a seat-squirming, heartburning, hit-the-pause-button-while-you-run-to-the-john pumper thumper.  PHONE BOOTH takes a simple--almost ridiculous--premise and turns it into an 80-minute rollercoaster ride.  Director Joel Schumacher should have included the instructions, &quot;Hold onto your seat&quot; on the DVD cover.<p>Okay, so the film has a few problems, beginning with the sleaziness of the protagonist, Stu Shepard (played wonderfully by Colin Farrell).  Stu is not exactly the kind of guy one would like to have as a business partner--or, as it turns out, as a faithful spouse--yet over the course of the movie Farrell effectively brings humility and humanity to the character.  In addition, the sniper's control of the entire story requires a major suspension of disbelief, and the inability of police on the scene to quickly determine the person Stu is talking to on the phone as the &quot;bad guy&quot; is mind-boggling. <p>But who cares?  PHONE BOOTH still delivers a spine-tingling thriller, centered around a terrified man unable to leave a phone booth lest the sniper (the magnificently evil voice of Kiefer Sutherland) would cut him down.  Forest Whitaker is also solid, albeit dense, as the police officer in charge of negotiating Stu out of the phone booth.  The ending is predictable, yet still wickedly done.  Put some handrails on your recliner and enjoy.<br />--D. Mikels</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Aeon Across 90 Minutes"></head><body><p>Charlize Theron stars in the live action adaption of the Aeon Flux animated series, which originally was on MTV. Here on Australia, the animated series was on really late on a station called SBS, so I've only caught a couple of episodes. It looked interesting, and I thought the adaption might be worth a look. Wasn't as good as I'd expected though.<br /><br />Set a few centuries forward into the future, most of mankind has been wiped out by viruses, and wild jungle has reclaimed the planet. The remainder of humanity resides in a city, heavily controlled and plagued, not by viruses, but by mysterious disappearances and memories that haunt the minds of its citizens in dreams. Aeon Flux (Charlize Theron) is part of a resistance group, determined to have more freedom than they have. Aeon's own resistance becomes all the stronger when her sister is killed by the government. She sets out into the heart of the city, and stumbles on much more than she bargained for, including a lover she never knew she had.<br /><br />I must say I liked the look of the film, and the sets and such were probably what I liked best about the whole thing, a good combination of slick civilization and the lush green of the surrounding jungles and gardens. But looks aren't everything. Even though the film was a modest hour and a half, due to the straight faced dialogue and heavy seriousness over everything, it felt like much, much longer. Seemed to drag, despite the action there didn't seem to be a lot that actually happened. I can understand why the dialogue was the way it was, it adds to the unnatural atmosphere of the city, and it's similar to the way the dialogue is done in the animation, but a bit of humour and warm emotion would have been nice.<br /><br />Special features include two audio commentaries and five behind the scenes featurettes which include footage from the original MTV series. It was good to see the comparison between the film and the cartoon. In making the film, you can see that they have tried to recreate the feel of the film. On the other hand, it doesn't quite capture the more bizarre elements of the animation, which is what made the original series so unique, I reckon.<br /><br />As much as I like science-fiction, and as much as I liked the look of the film, I can't say I liked or recommend this film. Have a look at something else, the original Aeon Flux animated series, even.</p></body></html>

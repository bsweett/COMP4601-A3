He finds himself training, with great reluctance, an aspiring female boxer.  Their relationship goes from rocky to deep and loving (not as lovers, but as father/daughter.)<br /><br />I've seen a few reviews here and elsewhere that say the movie is just full of cliches.  Pardon me, but can a movie be made about sports that isn't?  If it's about winning or losing in any fashion, it's a cliche.<br /><br />What is great about MILLION DOLLAR BABY is that while it doesn have some "cliches" (the boxer actually manages to earn her way to a title fight...the grizzled trainer warms up) this is a movie that skirts the cliches with details that are true and cut to the bone.<br /><br />Director Clint Eastwood is often praised for telling stories without a lot of fluff.  He's well known for filming fast.  But what this seems to do for him as a filmmaker is to allow him to capture something that feels true and spontaneous and then he moves on...he doesn't try to work it...to make it "truer" or "more spontaneous."  He knows that no moment ever brings perfect clarity.  That every time a person learns a hard lesson about life, it isn't just a time of growing...it's a time of reluctantly giving up on something you've clung to for a long time.  With growth, with love, with respect and with hope also comes the knowledge that you are opening up to loss, rejection, tragedy and despair.<br /><br />MILLION DOLLAR BABY's charactes are far to specifically realized to be relegated to "cliche" status.  Eastwood plays the trainer.  He's a hard, grizzled man, gravelly voiced, slow moving and simmering...in many ways a typical Eastwood hero.  But we see all too soon that beneath his surface is actually a very decent fellow, capable of love and regret, capable of strong feeling (and also a good, instinctive trainer) who has simply closed himself up because of past events.  It's as though his very movements have been constricted by regret.  It is Eastwood's best performance ever, hands down.  It's Clint, I know it is...but never has he come close to this.<br /><br />Hillary Swank is the boxer.  Her character is too old to start boxing, but it's a dream she's had all her life and she's sacrificing almost everything to give it a shot.  She also instinctively senses the Eastwood can also be the "father" that she loved and lost years ago...the only other person who supported her dreams.  She's one tough cookie, but she's naive.  We believe she is totally brave, and we know we wouldn't want to get in a fist fight with her, but she is also very vulnerable.  She's easy to love, and she WANTS love.  More than she wants to box, she wants to fit in somewhere.  She isn't looking for a husband or child...she needs the uncomplicated, unquestioning love of a parent.<br /><br />Morgan Freeman plays Eastwood's oldest friend, a former boxer who lost an eye in a fight (and Eastwood blames  himself) and has worked as a "sidekick" to Eastwood ever since, these days as a sort of manager/janitor at the gym (where he lives).  We know he has a gambling problem, but he's also the guy who perhaps is the wisest of all.  He's our narrator, and to some extent, he's really a dramatic device.  But Eastwood's character is revealed best (especially early on) in his relationship with Freeman.  And as far as I'm concerned, any film rich in the voice of Morgan Freeman is okay by me!<br /><br />Some have heard that the movie takes an unexpected twist as it nears its final 45 minutes or so.  Well, I can't deny that it goes places we hoped in our  heart (at least the heart that enjoys "sports movie cliches") it wouldn't go.  But it DOES go where the story needs to take us.  The movie leaves you wrung out in the end...but oddly uplifted too.  We see some strong, clear, brave HUMANITY in these very flawed characters.  They make tough decisions.  But their love for each other is so strong, that we can't help but be happy for them that they experienced such love.<br /><br />The movie deserves all its accolades.  It's long and moves at its own leisurely pace, but not one single time did I look at my watch.  It's absurdly well acted.  Swank, Eastwood and Freeman all deserved their Oscar nominations.  It's beautifully photographed as well...just marvel at the shadows and colors in the gym.<br /><br />I can't recommend it highly enough.  It's PG-13, by the way.  There's one "f" word early on, and a couple of fairly brief, but coarse references to the female body.  Other than that, there isn't anything overtly objectionable.  I say it's okay for ages 13 and over.  SEE IT!</p></body></html>

This is an intensive psychological murder mystery.  It is a roller coaster ride that starts out fast and never slows down.  This is a movie that explores the lives of three men deeply (in degrees) affected by a savage event of their youth.  As we see them as adults, we note the different directions that their lives have led and how they become intertwined again.  The development of the numerous essential characters in the story is outstanding yet it is done so well that the action never seems to slow down.  The acting is superb with special kudos to Sean Penn who seemed to reach new heights in his already impressive career.  There is such an array of subtlety, innuendo and shock that special recognition has to be paid to the Director; Clint Eastwood.  I know that he has directed before and won the Academy Award for &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;.  However, this movie has set a new standard for him as well.  The editing somehow missed an Oscar nomination but I can't see why in as much as the movie moves along so well.  If there is a criticism, it would be the ending.  I have no dispute with how the movie ends, I just think it falls a bit short of everything that led up to it.  I have not read the book but, knowing that the book is usually better than the movie, I'll certainly have to in this case.  This is not a movie for the whole family since the subject matter is probably too intense and, hopefully, incomprehensible for pre and early teens.  The violence and profanity is not over done as seems to happen so often these days.  This is a complex story told in a kaleidescope of imagery.  We get to know most all of the characters in such a way as to be involved in their pain and suffering.  The spouse of Dave is especially pathetic in a moving manner.  I don't necessarily watch movies to become emotionally exhausted.  However, when it happens, I know I have seen a work of art.</p></body></html>

But, let's face it---this movie belongs to the superb Michelle Pfeiffer, in an overlooked, should have been Oscar nominated performance.  Michelle portrays Norman's wife, Clare, a woman who has seemingly had a difficult year since a strange auto accident the year before the movie starts.  First thing you know she's sure that their new neighbor has killed his bizzare wife.  And, what's worse, a ghost is haunting Michelle, and she's sure it's the wife's ghost that's doing it.<p>Aha...that's just the start.  Robert Zemeckis, like Brian DePalma, pays homage to the great Alfred Hitchcock in this really spooky film.  Unlike DePalma, however, Zemeckis doesn't copy Hitch, but translates his style into Zemecki's own.  It's a brilliant directorial effort, again worthy of an Oscar nomination.  Diana Scarwid as Jody, Clare's friend, is also superb in a supporting role, bringing a little bit of humor and pizzazz to Clare's spooky life.<p>The plot twists and turns, in spite of the movie's trailer revealing something it shouldn't have, but it still works, thanks to the dominance of Pfeiffer in the leading role.  Her &quot;possession&quot; by the ghost reveals a sensual sexiness few actresses can pull off as convincingly.<p>The visual effects are stunning, and the last thirty minutes or so of the movie is spine-tingling in its intensity.  A real winner of a movie, that demonstrates that Harrison and Michelle are not over the hill.  This movie made well over a hundred million, and it's one of the best spook stories in recent years.</p></body></html>

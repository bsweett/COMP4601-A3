<meta name="summary" content="Robert Ludlum's Action Adventure Comes to Life"></head><body><p>A handsome young man (Matt Damon) is pulled out of the Mediterranean Sea by a fishing boat, unconscious. The man who digs a couple of bullets out of his back finds something else beneath the skin of his bottom: a small capsule with a laser that displays the name of a Swiss bank and an account number. It was the flashing of another laser embedded in his wet suit that had alerted the crew of the fishing boat to his presence in the water.<br /><br />He does not know who he is. Thus begins one of the most amazing adventure and chase stories in 21st century films. Even for someone who read the book, it is thrilling. There are enough differences (although the sense of it is maintained) that even though I remembered the book pretty well, I didn't always know what was going on here. When Jason Bourne discovers his passport in the lock box which was connected to that bank account number, he discovers another half dozen, some with the name Bourne and some with at least one other name. The pictures are all of the face he has been seeing in the mirror. There is also a great deal of money in several currencies (the setting is apparently pre-Euro), a gun or two, and some communications devices.<br /><br />So is he a spy? For whom? He clearly has incredible fighting skill, as he discovers when a couple of Zurich police hassle him for sleeping in the park. And a trip to the U.S. Embassy makes it clear there's something very fishy about all of this. He escapes with his life, but only just, and bribes a young woman to give him a ride to Paris.<br /><br />The entire story is really one long chase, but the little red car zipping through all obstacles in Paris is probably the most amazing car chase scene I have ever seen in any movie. (Well, until the next film; I seem to remember there's a pretty amazing one there, too. Bourne tops Bourne?)<br /><br />I'm not going to spoil it for you, but I will warn you that you may have to play this one two or three times to follow everything; the pace is just that rapid and the tale that convoluted. Much high-tech spy equipment, much ado about plenty. I defy anyone to predict what's coming next if they have not read the book, and half of those will get it wrong.<br /><br />Four stars for the non-stop adrenalin rush.</p></body></html>

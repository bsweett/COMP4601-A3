<meta name="summary" content="An Awesome Movie."></head><body><p>In this review I am only going to review the first installment because I have not yet seen the other two.  Back to the Future is a true Blast!  The movie is a whimsical movie that you will expect from Spieldberg.  It is not predictable in any sense.  The movie is definately a modern blockbuster classic.  It is completely different than any other time travel movie.  It is whimsical and less scientifical and complicated like we see in most time travel films.  The acting, sound, effects, and plot are all good.  See it, I highly reccomend it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Could have been great, but just Gun Porn by the end"></head><body><p>The first 20 minutes or so are truly riveting. Tense, taut, well-made and quickly paced, it's an action film ready to take off. Buuuut then it slows way down and gets preachy and never pays off.<br /><br />Marky Mark is getting a little better at playing the misunderstood patriot each time out. There are some great lines. Ned Beatty is funny as always (he just cracks me up for some reason, whatever role he plays). Too much violence, but that's what it takes to get big movie funding these days, it seems.<br /><br />I don't know how other reviewers can moan about this being liberal propaganda. I know few true liberals who would support this amount of gun porn, and the notion that a gun will solve almost all problems. Hollywood is awash in these movies now; god only knows how much money the gun and bomb makers give to making these movies, but it's got to be lots. They sure get it back in taxpayer money, times thousands. Great investment!<br /><br />The idea that our government is run by thugs making trillions by putting our soldiers in places we have no business being is hardly liberal. Read some statements by Republican politicians these days. Everyone's getting tired of seeing homeless folks everywhere here while we spend 10 billion a day on a war that most Americans despise.<br /><br />This movie hardly makes that point. It just says that the art of killing is a good one to know. And make sure you have lots of guns.<br /><br />Not exactly left-wing.</p></body></html>

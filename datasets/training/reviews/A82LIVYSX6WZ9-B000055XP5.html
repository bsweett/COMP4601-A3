<meta name="summary" content="good comic book brought to life of the big screen"></head><body><p>good comic book movie and it really is action packed, but some parts are boring and then it picks up the pace. but theres enought razzle dazzle action to go along with it and it pays off. for fans only, others who dont like this dont watch it.Hugh JAckman is great as Wolverine, but what im looking for is Gambit, he should be in this one, the sequels much better</p></body></html>

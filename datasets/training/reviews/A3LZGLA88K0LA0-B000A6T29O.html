This movie is flashy, fun, wildly ridiculous, campy, and adventurous.  Angelina Jolie pouts and moves appropriately; the action sequences are well choreographed, and the bad guys lose.  What more could one want in this type of movie.  Iain Glen is sufficiently villainous; Daniel Craig is a hunky, if traitorous, former associate; Chris Barrie is delightful as Lara's manservant, Hillary; and Noah Taylor as nerdy Bryce couldn't be better.  Grame Revill's score is nice, and Simon West's direction, while not all that original, moves the film along.<br />One shouldn't look for Oscar caliber material all the time; just sit back and watch instead of play the video game movie!</p></body></html>

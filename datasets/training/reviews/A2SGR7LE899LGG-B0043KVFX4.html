<meta name="summary" content="I am a sucker for zombie movies!"></head><body><p>I had very low expectations for this film, especially after Apocalypse (I really liked the first one however). I am a sucker for zombie movies and I found this film to be much more involving than I thought. It was cleverly tied to the other two movies and has momentum and action with a fairly twisty ending. Overall: GOOD! (remember it is a zombie movie afterall!).</p></body></html>

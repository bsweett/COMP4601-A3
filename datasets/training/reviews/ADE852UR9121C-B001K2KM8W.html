I was not expecting LOTR or Harry Potter here, I know there were more dramatic elements involved. But still, this movie did astound me on various levels. Is it a good movie? Absolutely. Is it great, Oscar-worthy material? I certainly don't think so.<br /><br />Ophelia travels to the countryside of somewhere in Spain with her mother, to join her stepfather, a foul man called Captain Vidal. Her mother is pregnant with Vidal's son, so naturally Vidal is very protective of the mother, or more aptly his baby son. There are some rebel militants in the countryside that threatens Vidal's military power. So, every so often we are treated to some gory albeit graphic scenes showcasing Vidal's evil/narcissistic behavior. Ophelia, a great fan of fantasy novels starts dreaming, meeting a faun (whose name is unknown but we assume it's Pan), he then tells her that she is the Princess reborn of the Underground Realm. To rightfully claim the title, she needs to complete 3 tasks. Upon completion, she will join the King and Queen, and live happily ever after. She enthusiastically accepts the challenges and her journey begins. Is it a dream, or is it real? I mean, this is after all a movie from the director of Hellboy, so nothing is far-fetched.<br /><br />To be honest, I was really absorbed in the story. No doubt, it's a very sad movie. The uniqueness of the movie is that it is told from the eyes of a little girl. Everything that happens, more or less revolves around her and her ideas or perception. This girl is living in a terrible place, she fears her stepfather, her mother is ill carrying her baby brother and she has no friends. She conjures this fantasy world to get away from all these. Her fantasy co-exists with reality. We, the audience at times never know where the fantasy ends and where reality begins. The storytelling is superb in that sense. Other than that, the cinematography is exceptionally good. There are traces of what we saw in Hellboy, but it seems more polished now. The acting is decent, but I was especially impressed with Ivana Baquero, who played Ophelia really well. Definitely a young actress to watch out for in the future. Another thing I loved about the movie was its haunting score, from Javier Navarrete. It really set the dark and bleak tone for the movie.<br /><br />As you can see, there are many things to like about the movie, but why I feel it is over-rated is because, it is not groundbreaking. The evil stepfather, the kind-hearted but ill-fated mother, the abused child are all quite clich&eacute;. Done quite well here, but still has a sense of repetition when watching the movie. Furthermore, the idea of escaping the harsh reality of war has been done before. Just watch Life Is Beautiful, where the father goes through so much to convince the young son that everything is just peachy although they are held prisoners in a freakin' military camp. Even Harry Potter toys with this idea, Harry is living in what seems like Hell with his Uncle and Aunty, until he found out he was a powerful wizard. I am sure there are many more examples.<br /><br />Also, there are some minor plot holes that didn't sit well with me. Unlike some people here, the graphic scenes did not disturb me but something I was eager to know, is what drives Captain Vidal to act the way he does? Does someone just wake up one day, and say "Hey, I'm gonna be an evil son of b*tch today"? Why does Ophelia just follow the faun's instructions without thinking twice about it? I mean, to be honest that dude who looks like a rejected character from Hellboy, doesn't exactly seem like the most trustworthy guy around. Has Ophelia seen the Underground Realm? I really think if the faun had offered Ophelia a glimpse of this mysterious realm, of how beautiful it is, that would make more sense. She would seem like she wants something better than what she is currently experiencing. Unfortunately, without knowing anything about the realm and the kingdom, she jumps at every command. Being the smart, grounded girl she is portrayed to be, I found this to be a little weird. The story was also not as emotionally charged as I hoped for, and this plays a big part in pushing a movie from good to great. Yes, there is a very heavy sorrow/sadness throughout the movie but it lacks moments of emotional brilliance that some classic movies have, where usually at a singular, pivotal point, it provokes certain feelings from audiences.<br /><br />I know those are minor gripes, which I usually don't even highlight when I am reviewing movies. But I just felt I had to mention those things because I really believe this movie is over hyped. It is good, especially for a foreign movie with a team of Mexican/Spanish people behind it, but to say that this is THE best movie of 2006, that it should win a Best Picture Oscar is something I strongly disagree. Buy this DVD for its storytelling and cinematography; I just hope you don't go in expecting one of the best movies of all time.</p></body></html>

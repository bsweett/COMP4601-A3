This thriller is marvellously well done. The killer aims at women, but the FBI agent who is going to solve the problem has retired after arresting Doctor Lecter, after finding out Doctor Lecter was the criminal he was looking for with the doctor's help, misguiding help, of course. It is when the cop understands that the killer kills his victims to eat them, in fact to serve them to his guests that he understands the Doctor is the killer. But this retired FBI agent who goes back into service in this new case discovers with imagination, vision, intelligence and observation some facts about and characteristics of the killer. But this is not enough. He has to profile the killer psychologically and this is very difficult. So he tries to cut the task short with the help of Doctor Lecter and this help is expensive in privileges or in manipulations. The doctor even goes beyond and becomes really dangerous, looking for his own vengeance. But this is not enough, yet, to arrest the killer. The cops have to sweep wide and comb thin to get across small details that become big opportunities. Once again it is observation that is essential, but with imagination and inspiration. Once the cops have found the small detail that is going to lead them on the road to the killer things are easier, though not at all less dangerous. And the killer plans the reactions of the cops and takes them into account in his own plans, which enables him to come with an ending that is quite different from what we are all expecting. This film, like the book behind, is interesting because it reveals that serial killers have to be intelligent, creative and extremely good chess players. They have to plan ahead enormously and foresee the reactions of the police. In other words, these killers would have been good cops if they were not moved by the desire to kill or even make other people suffer. But this film insists on the severe childhood years this killer has been through and how he inherited of his killing instinct from the mistreatment he got from his own relatives. What happens when he finds himself alone, no longer dominated and controled by these relatives ? He is haunted by them and kills in order to pacify them. And it is understanding this that makes the cop able to solve the last stage in the thriller. We can even wonder if a cop does not have to become a bodydouble or a clone of the killer to be able to find him and arrest or stop him. <p>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The worst remake of 2004.  Worst casting."></head><body><p>Please watch the 1962 version instead.<br />  The original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00020X88Y">The Manchurian Candidate (Special Edition)</a>(1962) included an all-star cast, Frank Sinatra as "Bennett Marco", Laurence Harvey as "Raymond", Janet Leigh, Henry Silva, John McGiver, James Gregory and Angela Lansbury.  Angela Lansbury is so memorable in her role as "Mrs. Iselin", a very rare performance from Lansbury that it has never been duplicated.  (Lucille Ball was once considered for the role).<br />  The original black & white film was very effective in showing subliminal hypnotism and the film sucks you right into the storyline.  Very dramatic 1962 film.<br />  This film was made before the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.  There are parallels in the film to Abraham Lincoln who was a President also assassinated.<br />  Making a remake of this film, first of all, is very risky and casting and storyline should have been just right, but I am not pleased with Denzel washington in the role that Frank Sinatra is  originally known for.  Harrison Ford, Timothy Dalton or Clive Owen would have been a better choice.  Meryl Streep as "Eleanor Prentiss Shaw" is perhaps the only interest I had in seeing this 2004 remake. There is no mystery, suspense, wonder nor intense hypnotizing going on as it did in the first film.  The thrill is gone in this remake.<br />  Please buy and see the original 1962 version <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00020X88Y">The Manchurian Candidate (Special Edition)</a> (1962) with Frank Sinatra, instead of watching this 2004 garbage.</p></body></html>

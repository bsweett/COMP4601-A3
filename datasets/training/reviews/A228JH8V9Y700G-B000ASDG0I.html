The movie itself was overshadowed by the fact that Brad Pitt had left his wife Jennifer Aniston for Angelina Jolie, his costar.  They put down the rumors saying "Oh no, we're just friends".  Of course, that's anything but true now.  Four children, world travel, charitable causes, and one of the most hyped celebrity couples (but not annoying like Bennifer) later, we all know better.  Trying to put that aside, this movie was pretty good.<br /><br />Brad and Angelina play a married couple in a rut.  Bored and rather unwilling to change their status as a "boring couple", they are living in the suburbs, going on with their otherwise mundane existences.  What neither of them knows is that they are both assasins, working for rival groups, and one day they are hired to off each other.  We see a series of events unfolding as they are off on their missions independently, then as their paths cross and realize they are not so boring after all.  Strangely enough, the spark in their marriage returns and they live happily ever after.  They really didn't know each other at all, did they?<br /><br />It's a lightweight action movie with a lot of shooting and violence, yet not campy like some action movies past.  It has a few moments of humor, but it, like their marriage in the beginning, starts of slow and boring.  But, it's a fun time without being too serious.  Good for some entertainment.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Endearing in a creepy way"></head><body><p>Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King of Halloweentown, dissatisfied with his lot in life, decides to take over Christmas in order to bring shrieks of joy rather than terror to the people of the world.  He enlists the twisted denizens of his domain in his cause and it is rather touching to see their inadequate but sincere attempts to understand what brings delight to ordinary people.  As part of the plan, Santa is kidnapped, and the evil Oogie Boogie takes advantage of the situation to attempt a take-over of Halloweentown for himself.<br /><br />This is a very amusing story told through the vanishing art of stop-motion animation.  The visuals are eye-popping, and I fervently hope that director Henry Selick and others will keep the form alive in the face of the onslaught of computer animation.  Danny Elfman's music is enchantingly sweet and catchy, but always a bit creepy and off-kilter as well--perfect for the material.  This world bears the unmistakable mark of producer/co-writer Tim Burton's unique imagination.  Highly recommended./</p></body></html>

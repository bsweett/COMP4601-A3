Bleakness so pervades every corner of this world that the light of hope cannot help but be extinguished.<br /><br />Theo Faron (Clive Owen) is drawn into the web of rebel group who have an important task for him.  He is told by his ex-lover, Julian (Julianne Moore), that he must accompany a woman named Kee (Claire-Hope Ashitey) out of England and deliver her to a sanctuary run by "The Human Project."  What makes Kee so special is that she is pregnant - a miracle in a world where the female population has become sterile.  Yet, Theo's task is far from easy as government factions and a rogue element within the rebel group want Kee for their own purposes.<br /><br />"Children of Men" does have its share of positives.  It does not shy away from addressing many hot-button issues regarding immigration, assisted-suicide, and totalitarianism.  Also, the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is astonishing.  The future world he captures on film is frightening and is all the more disturbing because it could easily be seen as prophetic in light of the numerous troubles currently plaguing the real world.  Yet, the film overall is ultimately unsatisfying.  The story turns out to be uninvolving and even borders on the boring after the film's premise is established.  As it unfolds, "Children of Men" devolves into nothing more than a prolonged chase that tries to keep matters interesting by sneaking in some social commentary every now and then.  Cuar&oacute;n undoubtedly set out to make a film with higher aspirations but only succeed in making one with squandered potential written all over it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Jacques is Back! And he's mostly in the PINK!"></head><body><p>IN A DEACADE in which it is cool to hate the FRENCH, remaking THE PINK PANTHER seems a natural. What isn't natural is making the film without director BLAKE EDWARDS (Skin Deep, Sunset, Victor / Victoria) : Offensive stereotypes, less than PC plotlines and of course old Hollywood's even less PC treatment of the women's roles.<br /><br />What of replacing the Inspector himself? What about PETER SELLERS, the original Inspector Clouseau, how can you replace him, in spite of the Trail / the Curse / the Son of the PINK PANTHER having been completed after Seller's passing. Who can fill those shoes? STEVE MARTIN? Maybe.  Martin IS a GENIUS of physical comedy; he can do a stupid French accent almost as well as Kevin Kline (what he's in this too, wow!) What about the Chief (Inspector Dreyfus)? Yep, Kline is Clouseau's nemesis and boss. And CATO, sorry, without Edwards to champion "all things un-PC" we lose Burt Kwouk's clever Asian "house-boy", who is replaced by Jean Reno (The Professional) as Clouseau's partner and a satisfying straight-man, Gendarme Gilbert Ponton. Reno, like CATO is instructed by Clouseau to hone his skills by hilariously attacking him whenever possible(this time in reverse).<br /><br /> The Story (or lack thereof): After a televised murder of French National Soccer team head coach Yves Gluant (Jason Statham of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels), where the famous Pink Panther diamond is stolen Clouseau is called in to "investigate." Chief Inspector Dreyfus has picked Clouseau because he is sure to distract the media & mess up the high profile case, so that  Dreyfus, can solve the case himself and win France's highest award: "Ze Medal of `onor."  Beyonc&eacute; Knowles is cast as a pop-singer (quite a stretch there) & girlfriend of the victim, also the femme fatal of the movie who everyone thinks "did it" except Inspector Clouseau: "LEAVE HER ALONE! CAN'T YOU ZEE SHE'S ZEXY?!?!" She sure is Inspector! The late Edwards would have approved. Another hottie Blake Edwards would have included had he made this one is Clouseau's secretary Nicole (Emily Mortimer) another excellent physical comedian. As displayed in her "too close for comfort" scenes with Clouseau. Although the character is another painfully clich&eacute;d stereotype, "the girl who is beautiful when see takes off her glasses."<br /><br />Steve Martin plays Clouseau as the late SELLERS (and the late DON ADAMS in GET SMART & the animated INSPECTOR GADGET) did before him: as a moron impressed with his own genius creating chaos and destruction wherever he goes, yet still managing to "solve" the case in the end.. Some good throwaway moments of the movie are scenes where you watch Clouseau struggle with English & etiquette. Like the new Star Wars movies, familiar tunes and visuals tie us to the original saga: the animated Pink Panther & Henry Mancini's immortal theme were both used this way to adequate effect. What isn't familiar about this remake is the absence of foreign-film-feel that Blake Edwards achieved so brilliantly throughout all of the original films. New PANTHER director SHAWN LEVY, who worked with MARTIN in CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN (1& 2), is no stranger to the scene crumbling chaos necessary to let Clouseau be himself. Here he comes through in the PINK, as in the previously mentioned works with another lightweight, moderately-family-friendly-fare (e.g. crude and suggestive humor, fart jokes and language.)<br /><br />This is a funny remake of the classic film series. If you are familiar with the originals it will make you want to put them on. If you're not familiar with the original PINK PANTHER series check them out. In addition to the Pink Panther, there is: SHOT in the DARK, The Revenge of the PINK PANTHER, The PINK PANTHER STRIKES AGAIN, (also filmed by Edwards, some with clips of the late Peter Sellers, some with filler-fools, but none quite as good as the first 5 films: "the TRAIL of the PINK PANTHER," "the CURSE of the PINK PANTHER," and "SON of the PINK PANTHER.") Go ahead and INSPECT them all!</p></body></html>

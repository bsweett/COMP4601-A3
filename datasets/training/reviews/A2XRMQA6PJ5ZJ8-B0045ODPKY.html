<meta name="summary" content="An exciting action flick with an interesting plot"></head><body><p>"Salt" is named after the character played in this film by Angelina Jolie.  It is not too much to say that this film appears to have been essentially designed to showcase Jolie's great looks and ability to carry off a non-stop action film.  The action in this film starts early and never ends.  The action scenes are well-done and exciting.  Of course, the trade-off is that to a significant extent the action comes at the sacrifice of more plot and character development.<br /><br />All that having been said, this film does have an interesting storyline; something of a "Charm School" theme for my fellow Nelso DeMille fans.  Without giving much of anything away (very minor spoiler) the plot here is that the Cold War Soviets have infiltrated the USA with Russian sleeper agents who were trained from childhood to pass as Americans.  Needless to say they are up to no good.  And therein lies the basic story of this film.<br /><br />My whole family enjoyed watching "Salt" and it is certainly good enough, and nuanced enough, to justify watching more than once.

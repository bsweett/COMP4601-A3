<meta name="summary" content="Stop dragon my heat around"></head><body><p>Basic story is that a young Viking, from the North on the Island of Berk, who was keen on hunting trolls, gets his opportunity at an elusive dragon. When he confronts his Viking ways he must decide for himself weather to dispatch his prey or will he come to an understanding of the true nature of the beast.  If you own cats you can see the dilemma and the conflict. Not that any feline is in danger of being dispatched.<br /><br />There is nothing unique about this movie.  The story is old as the hills. The animation while not intrusive to the message is not unique either. There are no news truths or insights or anything.  There is the standard minus and a boy coming of age with others attempting to do so also. It is refreshing to find the single family parent is the father however it is the old single parent family conflict. The one big flaw in the story is that the only dragon that could use befriending was targeted for dispatching by everyone including fellow dragons; what kind of message does that send?  I have to admit I did not read the book so I cannot compare the book/movie.<br /><br />On the positive side they picked some good voices (see the DVD extras) for the individual characters. They did not constantly bombard the movie with unrelated background music. There attempt at cute contemporary dialog works pretty well. The dialog was not drummed down as most of the later Disney movies.</p></body></html>

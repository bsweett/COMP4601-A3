<meta name="summary" content="The first of C.S. Lewis' Chronicles is lovingly brought to the screen"></head><body><p>I saw the BBC production of "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe," the first installment of "The Chronicles of Narnia" by C.S. Lewis, and even though it had an animatronic Aslan the magic worked because everybody treated it as if it were alive. That same principle holds true for the theatrical version that opened today. The four siblings who enter the land of Narnia through the wardrobe accept what is happening and where they are as well as the responsibilities that fall to them in that land, and we believe as well. This is also because the children come across as being real, consistent in their personality traits until they learn better or the situation compels them to grow up accordingly.<br /><br />The four Pevensie children are sent by their mother from a London that is being blizted nightly by Nazi bombers to stay in the country with Professor Kirke (Jim Broadbent). They are under instructions from the housekeeper, Mrs. MacReady (Elizabeth Hawthorne), to basically do none of the things that children do. It is while playing a game that is probably forbidden that the youngest, Lucy (Georgie Henley), discovers there is more to the wardrobe in the spare room than meets the eye. Her siblings, Peter (William Moseley), Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Susan (Anna Popplewell) do not believe her until they see for themselves. But then they discover that the magic that is Narnia is not as white as the driven snow when they meet up with the White Witch (Tilda Swinton).<br /><br />Unlike many of these big production children's movies this one is filled with mostly unfamiliar faces. Popplewell is the only one of the kids with more than a single credit. Broadbent is the most recognizable face, but he has a minor part. James Cosmo, who plays Father Christmas, will look familiar but few will place his name and there will be those who swear that it is Cate Blanchett who is playing the White Witch. Liam Neeson is cast perfectly as the voice of Aslan and once you recognize it is him you can forget who is doing the voice and just enjoy the story. Similarly, when Aalan makes his sacrifice the Christian allegory of Lewis' story becomes patently obvious, but the story still works for those who see Azlan and think of "The Lion King" rather than Jesus Christ. That is why "The Chronicles of Narnia" is the most powerful and popular Christian allegory of the 20th century, and why few fans will find fault with this cinematic adaptation.<br /><br />Director Andrew Adamson helmed all of the "Shrek" movies, where the pop culture references flew fast and furious. In this film he casts his creative net even further in bringing together familiar images and magical moments. I was reminded of Dorothy discovering the Technicolor land over the rainbow in "The Wizard of Oz," the train trip to Hogwarts in "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," and the great clash of armies from "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King." When the Witch shows up in her polar bear drawn chariot I was reminded of Frank Frazetta's cover painting for "The Eternal Warrior" and the last time we see Aslan recalls Mary Stevenson Parker's inspirational poem "Footprints." So a lot of what is in this movie will resonate with a lot of viewers, which is totally fitting given the chronicles related by Lewis.<br /><br />They did a superb job on the packaging for this two-disc collector's edition.  The DVDs are in a case that has nothing on the cover but the wardrobe, which I learned has carvings that tell the story of "The Magician's Nephew," which is Lewis' prequel to this story.  That fits into a box and when you remove it reveals Lucy in Narnia by the lamppost in the snow.  Disc 1 has the movie and the blooper reel.  You can watch the movie again with commentary by either the kids and the director or by other filmmakers for more of the technical aspects.  You can also turn on the Narnia Fun Facts that will pop up throughout the film.  Disc 2 has featurettes representing the two world of Narnia.  Creating Narnia has bits that look at the director, the children, the creation of the film, the life and work of C.S. Lewis, and various cinematic storytellers.  The common denominator here is that this was clearly a labor of love.  Then the Creatures, Lands & Legends part looks at the various creatures from legend that populate Narnia.  Final Note: Be sure to watch the credits because there is a scene right after the cast credits.  Plus, there is an Alanis Morisette song, "Wunderkind" to listen to as well to let the movie play out to the end.</p></body></html>

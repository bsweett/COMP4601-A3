<meta name="summary" content="Not as good as the first one"></head><body><p>The first one was better because it was something we had never seen before. Having read the comic books, I wondered if Hugh Jackman was a good choice to play the hardened Wolverine or if Halle Berry would make a good Storm.<br /><br />So the sequel is supposed to be bigger and better in it's action sequences because we have the background story as well, but it is not necessarily so in this movie. There is alot of action, but much of it is of the generic type. The fight between Mystique and Wolverine was much better than the one between Deathstrike and Wolverine (in this one the action was so cut and jerky that I couldn't see clearly half the time). I was not impressed with most of the characters and a few of them took a step backwards in this movie.<br /><br />The characters of Cyclops and Storm are key examples. It is hard to make Halle Berry asexual and unexciting, but Director Bryan Singer made it so. Cyclops comes off as a semi-gay, nsync fan who is the fall guy for the blossoming Wolverine/Jean Grey relationship. Other characters whose motivation is a mystery is Pyro. He's a jerk but for him to run off with Magneto and Mystique doesn't make sense.<br /><br />Another character that is weakened from the original movie is Rogue. In the first movie, she (played by the highly capable Anna Paquin) has a teen angst spin that was mildly interesting, but in this one she turns into a helpless, sniveling whiner who only is interested in getting it on with Iceman. However, they decide to expand the role of Iceman and he becomes more of a 3D character.<br /><br />Not all is lost though, Jean Grey is always interesting and fascinating and is played with appeal by Famke Janssen (even if she develops mysterious powers without explanation like Evy O'Connell from the "Mummy Returns"). She is by far the most facinating character in this movie.<br /><br />Not far behind is the new character "Nightcrawler", played by Alan Cumming. However, Singer does not spend enough time fleshing out the character and by the end of the movie, all we know is that he is German, was from a freakshow, has angelic carvings on his body and is very religious. They need to expand his role in X3.<br /><br />Rebecca Romaine-Stamos returns as the seductive (yet repulsive) Mystique. She is the fire of the group and is not afraid to show her emotions through the movie. Wolverine should be as upfront as she is.<br /><br />Overall, the feel of this movie is not different from a James Bond movie. There are the big set pieces, the mad conqueror, characters with interesting names and the world domination plot. It is not original, or even as good as the first movie and I'm sure that non followers will be stumped by the Phoenix plot of X3.....Rating: C-</p></body></html>

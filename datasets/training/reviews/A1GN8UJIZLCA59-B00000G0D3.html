It was first done as a silent film, then remade in the 1920's and then tackled in this epic version.  The film literally employed a cast of thousands and at the time of its release in 1959 was a technical marvel.  Forty years later the film still stands up and the DVD version perfectly captures the grandeur of the film.  The chariot race is one of the most famous scenes in movie history and despite all the technological advances has yet to be duplicated or surpassed.  Charlton Heston won his only Oscar in the title role and he's at his bombastic, self-righteous and over-emoting best.  Jack Hawkins is excellent as his one-time best friend turned rival and Hugh Griffith is delightful as the sheik who supplies Ben Hur with the horses for the chariot race.  Mr. Griffith also won an Oscar as Best Supporting Actor and Mr. Wyler won his third Best Director award as the film went on to win an unprecedented 11 awards (including Best Picture).  That was record that stood until 1997 when Titanic matched it.  One complaint about an otherwise superb DVD release is that instead of putting the almost four hour film along with all the extra material onto two disks, they made one double-sided disk.  The lettering distinguishing the two sides is extremely small and difficult to figure out and it is a nuisance to get up during the film to flip the disk over.</p></body></html>

Stephen Frears's style is very matte, no gloss, which was the right medium to depict the restrained, modestly upright lifestyle of the royals.  You can't help but feel the stark difference between their demeanor and that of their subjects.  This is exacerbated by both side's reaction to the death of Lady Di.  The royals desired a private burial for Diana whereas the nation wished for a public one since she was considered the "People's Princess".  Throughout the movie you find yourself trying to identify with points of view and then figuring out which side was truly right to begin with.  Of course, none of this is resolved on screen, but the resulting events are well played out in a sort of denoument of compromise.<br /><br />While Helen Mirren was spot on playing Queen Elizabeth, I felt Michael Sheen was also deserving of an Oscar for his portrayal of Tony Blair, handling his first official crisis after just stepping in office (ironically foreshadowing a real-life future one much larger than this).  Tony Blair, much like the audience, is caught somewhere in the middle, trying to understand both sides and come up with a resolution that allows both to save face.<br /><br />This is definitely a worthwhile movie, but for those who prefer something a little more action packed, I'd advise you to skip this.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Well-done historical movie"></head><body><p>Russell Crowe does a superb job of portraying British naval hero "Lucky" Jack Aubrey as he pursues a bigger and better-prepared French ship off the coast of Brazil in the early 1800's.  He is an inspiring leader, who keeps his eye on his objective while encouraging and mentoring his crew.  Paul Bettony gives a very good performance as the ship's doctor who gives his friend Aubrey his honest opinion about his decisions as the ship's commander.  The Dr. is fascinated by the unknown creatures he sees on the Galapagos Islands and is very disappointed when his specimen-collecting expedition is interrupted by the reappearance of the French ship.  This is a beautifully filmed movie with lots of action and good performances by the actors.</p></body></html>

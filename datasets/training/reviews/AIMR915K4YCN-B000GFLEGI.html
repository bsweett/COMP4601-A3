This time, they are led by a semi-intelligent mechanic zombie that learns and teaches the others how to better find soft, warm nourishment. Meanwhile, within the exclusive high-rise cluster known as Fiddler's Green, the inhabitants are unaware that they've been added to the menu. Dennis Hopper rules over the city in despotic fashion, as sort of a zillionaire Stalin figure. Simon Baker and John Leguizamo are two of Hopper's men. Leguizamo gets to play the reckless road warrior, while Baker is the more rational, compassionate type. Asia Argento is the tough, smart hooker w/ military training. The rest are either minor characters and / or zombie-chow. Romero had a bigger budget for this one and it shows. LOTD is flashier and more hollywood-looking, which is both good and bad. Good because it is so well-made, bad because it lacks the low-budget griminess of NIGHT, DAWN, and DAY. Still, George is king of the zombies, and his latest installment is gooshing w/ enough biting, ripping, and other fun to make it a classic in its own right...</p></body></html>

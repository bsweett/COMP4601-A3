The film takes us back to James "Jimmie" Logan's childhood where a very young Wolverine is forced to flee with his older brother following an unfortunate chain of events leading to the death of his father and stepfather. His troubles however, have only just begun...<br />Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber, and the rest of the cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least, however, there is a very noticeable absence of attractive women that we have become accustomed to in previous X-Men films (such as Famke Janssen, Halle Berry, and Rebecca Romijn among others).<br />X-Men Origins: Wolverine is very well written and very well presented, and thus allows for a highly entertaining movie that can be watched over again. The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the action, and the music are all good.<br />In short, X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection.

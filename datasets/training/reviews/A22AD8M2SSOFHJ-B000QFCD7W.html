<meta name="summary" content="A Suprise Comedy Hit"></head><body><p>I originally judged this movie as another mid life crisis movie. After getting the chance to watch this movie I must admit I was completly wrong. This movie is great. It's a fun comedy with great chemistry between the actors.<br /><br />The adventure starts by introducing all four characters. Tim Allen, John Travolta, William Macy, and Martin Lawerence. Each character brings something special to the movie. I can say most of the movie I was laughing at loud because most of the humor is physical. There isn't a deep involved storyline so you don't have to worry about keeping track of much.<br /><br />I would say this movie can be viewed by the entire family as it has few profanities and very little physical violence that is mainly comical. It is really one of the best comedies this year and should be a must view for anyone who wants a good laugh.</p></body></html>

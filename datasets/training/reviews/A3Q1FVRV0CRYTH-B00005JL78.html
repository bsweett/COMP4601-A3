As many of my friends know, I am not a fan of Tom Cruise.  I think he's a highly overrated actor who receives far too much attention and praise for his own good, but I've always said that he knows how to pick a movie.  A lot of my favorite films (`Eyes Wide Shut', `Minority Report', `Vanilla Sky' & any of the `Mission Impossible' films just to mention a few) are Tom Cruise Vehicles.  This film is no exception, but here Tom is far outweighed by the strength of his co-stars Samantha Morton and the new kid on the block Colin Farrell.<br /><br />The premise takes place in the not so distant future of 2054 when crime is all but non-existent because of a new `precrime' division of local law.  This division is spearheaded by John Anderton (Cruise), a man haunted by the disappearance of his son six years prior and is now determined to make sure nothing like that ever happens again.  Relying on the premonitions of three `pre-cogs' (three children born to drug addicts who suffer from a horrible gift enabling them to see murders before they actually happen), this team has been able to all but eradicate murder as a whole.<br /><br />Just as the morals and accuracy of the project are brought into question by Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) it appears the pre-cogs predict that John himself is to murder a man he's never met.  This catapults John into a game of cat and mouse as he tries to prove his innocence while uncovering a strange murder that pre-cog Agatha (Samantha Morton) keeps seeing over and over.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg's direction here is fantastic.  Visually this movie is stunning from start to finish, and plot-wise this is a film that will keep you intrigued and involved.  Samantha Morton is stunning as usual, completely stealing every scene she's in and becoming her character mind, body and soul.  Colin Farrell makes a fine breakout here, stealing scene after scene from Cruise and proving to be the more charismatic and entertaining actor of the two.  Max von Sydow also pulls out a nice little performance as the ambiguous Lamar Burgess, mentor to the now troubled John.  It was also nice to see Kathryn Morris (of `Cold Case' fame) here as Lara, John's ex-wife.  It's not that Tom is awful here, he actually pulls out a nice performance, but he's easily overshadowed by the finer actors (Morton in particular who dominates everyone of her scenes) and just continues to shock me with his constant undue praise.<br /><br />Overall `Minority Report' is one of the best films of 2002, visually, intellectually and entertaining-wise.  It's a complete joyride from start to finish despite Tom and is well worth multiple viewings.</p></body></html>

I loved it!"></head><body><p>There is never a dull moment in this fast-paced dark 2008 film that was nominated for an academy award for best screenplay.<br /><br />After two Irish hitmen mess up a job in England, their boss sends them to the town of Bruges, Belgium.  They don't understand why they are sent there but have to listen to the boss's orders.<br /><br />One of the men, Colin Farrell, would much rather be in Dublin and complains the whole time.  He's the younger of the two and immediately finds an attractive woman to hang out with.  The older man, Brenden Gleeson, takes it all in stride and follows the boss's order which is to enjoy the town itself and do some sightseeing.  There is conflict between the two from the start but it is easy to tell there is also a deep friendship and understanding.<br /><br />The boss, who we only meet through his voice until the last part of the film, is played by Ralph Fiennes.  It's a great role and he plays it with over-the-top colorful language and a sense of viciousness as well as a sense of honor and playfulness.  How this all comes together is testimony to the skill of the screenwriter.<br /><br />It doesn't take too long for things to get out of hand.  There is non-stop action, violence and pathos.  And, believe it or not there is quite a bit of comedy.  I was at the edge of my set the whole time waiting for what would happen next.  I was horrified by some of the violence.  I laughed out loud at the funny parts.  And, mostly, I was made aware of the very imperfect human beings these characters were and how there were many sides to each of their personalities.  All of this unfolded so quickly that before I knew it the film was over and I was left with the deep satisfaction of seeing a small work of art.</p></body></html>

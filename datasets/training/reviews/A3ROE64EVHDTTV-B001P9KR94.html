Baffled by how a lower-class individual could answer such intelligent questions, the authorities interrogate the snot out of him.  He recounts how he knew each answer by delving into the experiences of his life.<br /><br />The Good Things<br />*Video quality is excellent; it is very colorful, detailed, and clean.  There are only a couple of grainy scenes.  The sound quality is good, although some parts seem lower than others.<br />*Includes a commentary, 12 deleted scenes, a making-of featurette, a behind-the-scenes footage of the "Toilet Scene," a short film (entitled "Manjha"), a music video, and a digital copy.<br />*Photography is good.  There are a lot of good camera angles.  Most shots have a unique color/lighting scheme.  Subtitles have a colored box behind them.  It's a vivid visual style overall.<br />*Production design is great.  There are a lot of good (authentic) locations.  Costumes and props are great, and never out-of-place.<br />*Story is not bad; there are a number of parallel subplots where the character is struggling against other people who are supposedly better, smarter, stronger, or richer than he is, and ultimately has to fight for his life and well-being numerous times.  It is interesting, but may be seen as long or tedious.<br />*Acting/writing are not bad.  Characters are interesting enough.<br />*Music is cool.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Not for kids; contains violence, swearing, brutality, and a scene where the little boy is dumped in a pile of crud.<br /><br />The Questionable Things<br />*The whole movie is edited in a way that flips back and forth between present-day and past events.  It can be interesting, but if you're not paying close enough attention, it can be confusing.<br /><br />It is funny that this is a movie about a poor man who won it all, and this is a low-profile independent movie that won many awards.  But it is a good, respectable film in its own right.  It is a brutal drama with a lot of scenes that are heart-wrenching, and is captured on film nicely with a strong visual style.  It ultimately paints a strong autobiographical portrait.  For anybody who has the patience and tolerance, it is quite worthwhile, and the disc is excellent.</p></body></html>

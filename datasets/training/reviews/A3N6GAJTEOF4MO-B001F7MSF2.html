I have to admit that although it did have its moments, I found myself becoming bored during the movie. The action sequences were the only relief I felt as when we entered into the emotion sequences I simply found my mind drifting. Guillermo Del Toro's work was completely alien to me until the first Hellboy, now although I did enjoy the original I didn't have many high hopes for the sequel. I guess when he entered into the Hellboy 2 project, Del Toro sought to give us a more fast paced, action packed flick that can keep you hooked from the beginning.<br /><br />In this movie life is great for Big Red (Ron Perlman), he's now in what some would call a perfect relationship with Liz (Selma Blair), he has a lot of cats and is just enjoying life. Unfortunately the happiness isn't going to last very long as in the dark supernatural underworld, Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) is planning to rise the indestructible Golden Army once again to destroy the human world. His sister who he's linked to by life doesn't agree with his plans and tries to stop the prince reforming the golden crown which would give him ultimate power over the army. She seeks the help of Big Red and the B.P.R.D.<br /><br />At an increased budget of $80 Million it's obvious from the start that Hellboy 2 is looking to use that budget well. Along with the introduction of a new boss Johann Krauss (Seth Macfarlane), this instalment seeks to introduce a plethora of new fantasy creature. The "Tooth Fairies" are especially bizarre and in a way frightening at their frantic carnivorous nature. A scene that takes place in troll market is especially wonderful with the number of different species going about their daily lives as if in a normal street market.<br /><br />Along the lines of the insanity of new creatures and sheer bizarre nature of some of them, we also see the return of the classic comic one liners. One of my favourite lines in the movie was so simple, yet so effective. A human yells "Hey, you're Hellboy" and right back he says "Yeah Yeah I'm Ugly". To some this may just seem like a witty one liner just for the sake of humour, but it shows how Hellboy is becoming tired of the public admiration and no longer wants a part of it. He also has the talent of coming out with great lines during the action sequences which make them even more enjoyable.<br /><br />Talking about the action sequences, there are plenty to really entertain in this film. The fights involving Prince Nuada are especially enjoyable as they're simply so fast paced that you can hardly keep up. The CGI is flawless and blends well with both characters and environment. Along with the action and humour we are still given the heart of the old movie. We see the relationship between Hellboy and Liz develop into something more serious and Abe Sapien also finds what he would possibly consider his true love. To see them personal relationships blend along with the professional relationships involving the new boss, Krauss. All of the above come together to create an enjoyable 2 hour movie experience that, even if you weren't a fan of the first movie, it's a promise that you will enjoy this instalment. I can only hope that a third movie will be made and possibly on a bigger budget as, although I hate to say it. With this movie series, it seems a bigger budget has meant a much better movie.</p></body></html>

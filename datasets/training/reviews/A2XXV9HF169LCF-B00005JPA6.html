But it is also graceful, full of wonder and strangeness. It's sad and lovely and creepy.<br /><br />Don't worry; there are no spoilers here. You learn almost all these facts in the first few minutes of the film.<br /><br />This is the story. It's about a little girl.<br /><br />This is the other story. It's also about a little girl.<br /><br />In the first story, the little girl is the daughter of a tailor. He father is dead and her mother has remaried, and they are going to live with the new husband in his home in the woods.<br /><br />In the other story, the little girl is a princess, daughter of a king who rules below the ground. She envies sunlight and flowers, and runs away to the mortal realm above her head.<br /><br />In the first story, it is World War 2 and the little girl's new father is a Captain in Nazi Spain. Her mother is pregnant with his child, a son. He guards the valley through which the trains run from his headquarters at the old mill.<br /><br />In the second story, the princess dies above ground, old and cold and far from home. And her father says: her soul will come back to us in some other way, and we will wait until the end of time for her.<br /><br />In the first and second stories, there is a dark old labyrinth in the woods, near the old mill....<br /><br />In this story the fair realm the tailor's daughter wanders upon is as dangerous, as strange and difficult to navigate as the real world; there are monsters a plenty, and the fairies are not sweet children with wings. Trust is as strange and thorny there as anywhere, and promises have weight and texture.  Even the tales she tells in the real world for her own comfort, her fairy tales, have no happy endings; just prickly questions and loose ends that sit inside your mind and make you a little uncomfortable. Her fairyland is the fairyland that folks once knew, where punishment for laziness and pride lurked around every corner and stupidity would definitely get you eaten.</p></body></html>

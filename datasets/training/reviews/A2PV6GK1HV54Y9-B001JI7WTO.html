Brendan Fraser always plays the smart but dimwitted guy, his facial expressions say it all. Josh Hutcherson is a great younger actor, he actually carries this movie instead of Fraser. The action and special effects are excellent but the storyline is rather mundane, it's a mixed bag for me.</p></body></html>

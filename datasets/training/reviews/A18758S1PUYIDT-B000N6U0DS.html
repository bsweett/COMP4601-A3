<meta name="summary" content="Very nice performances from father and son"></head><body><p>Will and Jaden Smith do a lovely job here, with the former playing against type and the latter making a nice debut in a very natural, unprecocious way.  I could have done without some of the more obvious, in-your-face stuff about pursuing happiness and the haves versus have-nots, but these are minor quibbles.  You really feel for Chris Gardner as he tries to make enough money to keep his son in day care, feed himself, and still train as an investment intern.<br />  Wow...you know you've really hit rock bottom if you and your kid have to sleep on t.p. on the floor of a bathroom in a subway station.  So sad.  I would have cried too.</p></body></html>

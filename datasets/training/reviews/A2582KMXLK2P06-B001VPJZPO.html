I just liked the old lady in the film.  :)<br /><br />After watching the Skeleton Key three times, I have come to the conclusion that it contains pretty good suspense, but it's not really a horror movie because nothing ever frightened me in any way.  It was just an above average film with an occasionally unsettling atmosphere.<br /><br />The movie takes place in a house in the southern United States.  Kate Hudson does a pretty good job in her role as the main character, though sometimes her curiosity with the mystery of the house (particularly her obsession with that one room in the attic) sometimes became WAY too much.<br /><br />I mean, come on, if someone taking care of a sick member of your family was ever THAT curious about something in your home, wouldn't you be annoyed by it?  And if that same person persistently kept picking at it until they found an answer, wouldn't that make it even MORE annoying?  Yes!  Of course!  Because what happens in your home is nobody elses business.<br /><br />As for the Skeleton Key plotline, it stayed consistently "above average" for about 70% of the film, and then the last 30 minutes picked up strongly with lots of action and a really good and unpredictable ending.  Not really a horror movie though.  That's the only thing about the film that kind of bothers me.</p></body></html>

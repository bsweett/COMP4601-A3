He is invulnerable and invincible.  He cannot be harmed and he has super human strength.  His super human talents continue to increase and he basically is a super hero style character like in a comic book story.  He meets a man, Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), that has searched for him all of his life.  He is a physically handicapped man with an evil side and he believes that if there are people like him in the world, then he believes that there are people like David Dunn.....<br /><br />This movie is about a man who has to learn to believe in himself and about a father and son's love for each other.  It also shows how one man can be a hero while others are evil!  This movie is one of M. Night Shyamalan's hits and he wrote, produced and directed the movie.  He also appeared briefly in the film.  He takes the time to develop the characters in the story and you get to understand their personalities.  You also won't see out of this world special effects but just a well told story about a man trying to find himself and understand his abilities.<br /><br />This is an excellent story and movie and Bruce Willis always does a good job in a motion picture and he succeeded in this one of putting forth a good performance.  I enjoyed this film and I believe you will like it too.  I recommend it to you!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Tarantino's first"></head><body><p>"Reservoir Dogs" has a lot of flashes of what's to come from Q.T.  And for that reason alone, "Dogs" is worth a watch.  To some extent the movie comes across as uneven, though the design of the film, with its flashbacks, is going to seem like that anyway.  Probably what best illustrates this is the extended conversation between Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) and Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) in the beginning of the film, regarding who set them up.  It just goes on too long, and could of easily been trimmed back.  It's like Tarantino had fallen in love with his dialogue, and then frontloaded it into the film, which makes for an awkward and talky start.<br /><br />That said, things pick up quickly.  Tarantino assembled a first-rate cast, and it pays off.  Lawrence Tierney, as the tough mastermind, is wonderful.  (I love how Q.T. brings back actors from the past.)  Buscemi, Keitel, Roth.  All excellent.  But check out psycho killer Michael Madsen!  He may of stole the film.  He's like a young Robert Mitchem at his most threatening.  His torture dance before a bound cop to the radio tune of  "Clowns to left of me, jokers to the right of me, here I am, stuck in the middle with you" is inspired (if very brutal) film making.  (Boy, did I squirm during that scene.)  Another winner, is Steve Buscemi's argument with Joe (Tierney) over his designation as "Mr. Pink."  Very funny, in an Elmore Leonard sort of way.  It's such scenes as these that have me nudging this one up from a three star to four star movie.  You sense this director is a cut above most others.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="great zombie movie"></head><body><p>I remember seeing this movie when I was only 9 years<br /><br />old. Back when I was young, I didn't view this as a<br /><br />scary movie at all. I'd actually would go outside<br /><br />and pretend I was the leading role guy Ken Fortee<br /><br />killing the zombies. Now, I have a different view<br /><br />and realize just what it would be like for some<br /><br />thing like this to really happen. The acting is<br /><br />really realistic and more natural which could<br /><br />almost make you forget that this can't happen.<br /><br />The music comes in at the right times that help<br /><br />pull you into the movie. It's high in gore, but<br /><br />no over the top that it isn't believeable. The<br /><br />zombies look alot outdated... ESP the clothes<br /><br />they wear. But hey, it was 26 years ago and what<br /><br />can you really expect? I do think the movie drags<br /><br />alittle bit at a latter part of the movie, but<br /><br />that doesn't pull the movie down overall.<br /><br />The characters bring different things to the table...<br /><br />Ken is is the take charge kind of guy that is the<br /><br />toughest... Scott is kind of cocky and at times<br /><br />forgets the seriousness of the situation and also<br /><br />sometimes borders on being insane... Flyboy is the<br /><br />guy that handles the planes and is probably the<br /><br />smartest of the four. Gaylen brings most of the<br /><br />emotional feelings that the other 3 don't provide<br /><br />very often.<br /><br />My favorite character is Ken because he is strong,<br /><br />aware, and has most of the common sense. He's just<br /><br />the type you want to lead your team. The one I dis-<br /><br />liked most was Flyboy... He just seems out of place<br /><br />at some spots and is sort of on the soft side and<br /><br />he really lacked charisma . But in a way, his death<br /><br />seemed to effect me more than the others.<br /><br />Overall, I'd say this is one of the best horror movies<br /><br />to come out. If you are picky about movies that look<br /><br />dated this might turn you off. But if you are open<br /><br />minded and like horror/zombie movies you are most<br /><br />likely going to like this movie.<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />My favorite parts are when they are at the hangers,<br /><br />Ken and Scott first going down into the mall, watching<br /><br />them get all the weapons and the ending. I think people<br /><br />misunderstood.... The ending is supposed to make you<br /><br />wonder if they made it. When Gaylen Ross mentions how<br /><br />low they are on gas that leaves me to under if they<br /><br />"Made it" as the movie was ending.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Wow, surprised at the low number of reviews and low scores"></head><body><p>I expected to open up the intro page for this movie, and see over 100 reviews.  I thought this was a dead on classic thriller.  Granted, it helps to be a big 24 fan, as my wife and I are, but we loved this one!  I started to watch 15 minutes early, and could barely wait to have my wife come home from work and watch the whole thing with me, last Friday night.<br /><br />Keifer Sutherland and Michael Douglas make an awesome onscreen team. I also enjoyed Eva Longoria, but she felt like "flavor of the month" eye candy, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy her. And my wife are both Desparate Housewives fans, too, so that also helps.<br /><br />The story was a bit hackneyed with use, but I didn't think it was predictable at all, as the commentary tells us that having a mole in the Secret Service is just unheard of, having never happened.  I liked the freshness of having the story in Washington (I hate how all the 24's are in LA, like its so common the President spends his time there.  Why can't it be in Washington DC one season?) as this is where the president is most of the time, correct?  I loved Sledge Hammer, the show, and was glad to see the main character from that series as the President.  Very surprising, and unpredicatable.  He did a great job, I thought!<br /><br />I would recommend this movie, and if you're not sure, rent it like I did, before you buy.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />MC White said: Check it out!!!</p></body></html>

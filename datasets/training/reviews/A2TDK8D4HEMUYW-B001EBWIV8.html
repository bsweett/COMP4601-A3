<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing sequel that relies on empty metaphors..."></head><body><p>I didn't quite know what to expect going into "The Matrix Reloaded," and I came out with mixed feelings. This is a sequel to the 1999 film that enthralled audiences. I was a bit underwhelmed by the original, and so I figured the sequel would either be better given my disappointment in the first, or even worse. There's no doubt it's a good film, but it has some very bleak, almost corny scenes with long, metaphorical speeches. There is either too much or too little thought put into this film.<p>It takes place, supposedly, a few days after the original. Neo can fly, Trinity wears tighter and shinier leather costumes, and Morpheus is fatter. Neo dreams that Trinity dies in the opening sequence. Then back in Zion they realize that 250,000 sentinals are digging their way into Zion. In order to stop something they need something that does something which involves, though does not limit to, (...), kissing Persephone (Monica Belluci), rescuing a Keymaker, having a long car chase, beating up people, cloning Unleashed Agent Smiths (who appears not nearly as often as the trailer would lead you to believe), and blowing up things.<p>This film's plot goes to waste very quickly and so it falls back on special effects. They're great, yes, but not very different from all the "Matrix"-rip-off films we've been getting since the original. The beginning sequence wows the audience with terrific special effects, but later in the film they must have run short on their budget because Neo's fight with the million Agent Smiths (...) Either one works.<p>(...)"The Matrix Reloaded" really only has some good action scenes, which includes a highway chase atop of cars, trucks, motercycles and more, that goes on and on for seventeen minutes. Action fans will eat it up.<p>But it's not exactly the smartest of films. It thinks it's really smart, it tries to prove it, but scenes like that with "The Architect" (NOT the Archeologist) prove the movie is out of ideas. It tries to continue the smartness and freshness of the first film and tries to have revelations, but they confused me because the film moved through all the plot scenes too quickly so they could return to the action. Maybe they will be all sorted out in "The Matrix Revolutions," which opens in November. I certainly hope so.<p>"The Matrix" may not have been one of my favorite films but I did like it to a certain degree. It seemed pretty smart and a breakthrough achievment in special effects. It targeted all filmgoers - from sci-fi to action to drama to romance - whereas "The Matrix Reloaded" really only targets two audiences - die-hard fans of the original and sci-fi-lovers. That's probably one of its biggest of many flaws.<p>But it is still a pretty good movie.</p></body></html>

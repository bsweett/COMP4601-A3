<meta name="summary" content="Hitchcock's Great Thriller Now In Blu!"></head><body><p>Although not my favourite Hitchcock movie (that would be <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017HMF6W">North by Northwest (50th Anniversary Edition Blu-ray Book)</a>) fans of this his great thriller will be very happy indeed with this blu-ray transfer which has now become the definitive and best version of the movie that is currently out there.  In addition to very good special feature documentaries we get a very good 1080p picture quality transfer and an even better DTS-HD MA 5.1 Surround sound quality as well albeit there is really little surround sound to appreciate from this mostly front-heavy sonic source material but still both picture and sound quality far exceed the dvd version that I previously owned.<br /><br />The problem with whodunnit's and thrillers like this though is that the original scare value and hence appreciation of the film drops off substantially once you know the ending and unless you are a film student having to write a paper on the film or a budding director trying to learn Hitchcockian technique most casual viewers may struggle to find great rewards from repeated viewing well at least that's the case for me.  There is no doubting that this is a great classic and is essential viewing if you haven't already seen it and if that's the case this blu-ray release is currently the best way to do this.  Although I've watched this a few times I can still see myself revisiting this film from time to time although not as regularly and with great anticipation as I do for other films that I do so annually such as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXB2">Lawrence of Arabia</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NTPDSW">The Godfather - The Coppola Restoration Giftset (The Godfather / The Godfather Part II / The Godfather Part III) [Blu-ray</a>], <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DJLCPE">Dr. Strangelove  [Blu-ray</a>] and especially <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q66J1M">2001: A Space Odyssey [Blu-ray</a>] among several others that I seem to be amply rewarded with each subsequent viewing.<br /><br />Great content, great picture and sound quality as well as special features makes this an easy review.<br /><br />Highly recommended!</p></body></html>

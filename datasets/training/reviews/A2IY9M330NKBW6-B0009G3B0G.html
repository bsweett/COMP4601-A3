It's been out a while and there are already quite a few reviews written here, but after now seeing it for a third time, I'm still impressed with it and how well it's holding up.<br /><br />This is a movie in the 'rubber reality' vein where Adrien Brody plays a soldier in Iraq in 1992 where he takes a bullet in the head. He's thought dead but comes around only to later get into trouble (mistakenly) with the law and ends up in a mental institution. This is where the rubber comes in. He's 'experimented' on by a doctor (played well by Kris Kristofferson) and starts slipping through time or reality or both. Another doctor (played by one of my faves Jennifer Jason Leigh) tries to help him through it all.<br /><br />This is just a way cool movie. I'll say up front that I AM predisposed toward this type of flick. "The Machinist", "Jacob's Ladder" and "Stay" are up near the top of my favorite movies list. This sits comfortably alongside those. Even at the third viewing I find myself intrigued at how the story unfolds. I like how subtle hints and happenings fold over one another. How they almost fit to form a whole but how the viewer sees that something is definitely not right. But the "how it's not right' is what lingers and keeps you drawn in.<br /><br />The cast is great. It looks good and is directed well. I can't recall much of the music so it must have melted deep into things. I guess what I like most is the adroit handling of the story. These can been tricky and difficult films to make. The viewers disbelief must be suspended throughout. If not, it crumbles right away and loses its audience. Like a good mystery, I found myself struggling to pull together all the clues and make sense of it all. At the end it does, I suppose, all fall apart but by that time I couldn't really care much. I'd already been on a wild, fabulous ride and it was well worth it.<br /><br />If you're at all predisposed toward this sort of thing, or are just a fan of the genre, this should keep you enthralled.</p></body></html>

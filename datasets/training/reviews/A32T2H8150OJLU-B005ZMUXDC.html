<meta name="summary" content="It's a hit!"></head><body><p>Disney's latest addition to the world of animated full-length features is a joy through and through.  I have to admit that I had heard so many positive things about Tangled before I saw it that I started to doubt whether it could be all that good.  As a result, I found my expectations lowering, and I went into the show with a critical eye.  What I found surprised me.  It was THAT good!<br /><br />The villian in this show is worthy of being grouped with Disney's best.  She is conniving, despicable, manipulating, and, well, evil...all to meet her own personal needs.<br /><br />The stroryline, characters, and their interactions were top-notch through and through.  I have to admit that one of my favorite character-character interactions was between Flynn Rider and the horse Maximus...you'll see.<br /><br />It was soon obvious that Tangled works at multiple levels: small children, tweenagers, teens, and adults.<br /><br />I happened to see the film in a theater that was completely packed (and in 3D).  When the movie ended there was actually applause.  The crowd liked it that well.<br /><br />I noted that John Lasseter (of Pixar) was the executive producer, but Disney pulled this off on their own...it wasn't a Pixar flick, though it's as good as Pixar releases.<br /><br />I look forward to the DVD release of this film, since it will certainly be joining my video library.<br /><br />5 stars</p></body></html>

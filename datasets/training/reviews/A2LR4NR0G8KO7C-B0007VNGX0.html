Although one knows what to expect in such a movie,<br /><br />any kind of plot usually keeps things exciting. In this case<br /><br />however the plot is not particularly interesting. As so many people get slaughtered during the first 20 minutes, we the<br /><br />viewers do not really care anymore about a little girl getting saved or not. Milla Jovovitch's stunt fights are surreal and her battle with Nemesis, clearly a distant relative of an Uruk-Hai from Lord of the rings, looks silly. I think this movie is unlucky that the crowd's appetite for zombie movies is starting to temper a little. We now want a reasonable story as well.<br /><br />Just shooting zombies isn't enough anymore. Shame about this movie though, as it obviously is a lot better than the previous part. This just looks like a wasted opportunity.(SARR)</p></body></html>

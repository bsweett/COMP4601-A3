<meta name="summary" content="Come on, it's a sitcom pilot!"></head><body><p>No, really, thanks to the folks at CBS, Nia Vardolos' admittedly funny - if hokey, intensely formulaic and predictable - little movie is becoming a midseason replacement sitcom called "My Big Fat Greek Life."<p>The film, which benefits from old-style laughs from veteran performers like Michael Constantine, Andrea Martin and Lainie Kaizan and family-centered conflict, is as comfortable as a well-worn pair of shoes. It's cute, almost to the point of cheesy. It's a Cinderella story (both within the film and in this sleeper's performance at the box office), and you don't have to think all that much to get it. Vardolos and John Corbett have a good, natural chemistry.<p>The reason this one was ignored at the outset of its release, though, is because it's so formulaic that there's nothing particularly remarkable about it. It's a tried-and-true audience pleaser, no more and no less.<p>As it ranks among the greatest films of last year, though, I prefer ones a bit deeper, more thought-provoking and more challenging.<p>The best this has to offer, though, is Martin's out-of-nowhere, long-winded story about the lump on her neck. That was the loudest I think I've laughed in a theater this year.</p></body></html>

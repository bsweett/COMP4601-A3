<meta name="summary" content="Music, dialogue, but no Goodfellas"></head><body><p>After the excellent Goodfellas Scorcese, DeNiro and Pesci team up again for another crime movie.<br /><br />Don't get your hopes up too much. 'Casino' is certainly not a bad movie but there are some points that don't work in it's advantage.<br /><br />Length: The real cut is almost 3 hours long and a little too long. Especially since there are now real points of rest. There is almost always a monologue by DeNiro and Pesci (occasionaly someone else) or the characters talk. There is never a period of action or silence. Sometimes the talk is almost a parody of gangstermovies.<br /><br />The music is good however, ranging from the 50s to 80s and very out there and part of the music.<br /><br />The acting is ok. Pesci is the best, deNiro his usual self but never super like in Raging Bull. Sharon Stone got an oscar nomination for her part of the wife of deNiro who keeps sliding down and down. But it's not a superpart and there have to have been better roles that year. More than 4 anyway.<br /><br />For the Scorcese fan this movie is ok. But it's long, a little too long and too fast so it might exhaust you.</p></body></html>

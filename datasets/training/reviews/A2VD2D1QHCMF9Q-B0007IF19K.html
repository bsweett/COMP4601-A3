<meta name="summary" content="Stellar Performance!"></head><body><p>This is a stellar performance by Jaime Foxx.  The film, however, is not as good, and drags along in many spots.  There are the usual stereotypes with drug use, seeing the light on Jim Crow, nasty and racist whites, money-grabbing friends, and so on.  But Foxx saves it.  He certainly deserved that Oscar!  It is a worthwhile movie with which to spend your time . . .</p></body></html>

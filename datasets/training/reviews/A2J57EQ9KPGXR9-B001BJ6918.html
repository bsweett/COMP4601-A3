This film has 1 (ONE) decent fight scene in it and lots of supposedly "intense" dialog.<br /><br />David Carradine and his phony martial arts pedigree shows up in the middle and at the end of this endurance test of a film to talk......and talk and talk and talk. In fact, the entire film is a blab-fest.<br /><br />I'm glad that I did'nt pay serious movie $$ to go see Part 2; Kill Bill should have been one long, good film instead of 1 good film and one bad one.</p></body></html>

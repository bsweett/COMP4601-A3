<meta name="summary" content="The Faces That We Meet"></head><body><p>In a time in american history when people did things like sleep with their doors unlocked, talk to strangers, and basically trust those who lived in their neighborhoods, the last thing on anyone's mind was child adbduction. Even more gruesome, child murder rears its head and says "here I am," taking the life of a 14-year-old girl who liked to take pictures, imagined herself as a wilflife photograpger, and helped her Dad build ships in bottles. The crime struck hard, and harder still was the acceptance of this tragedy by both the girl and her family. And all the while a killer walked their streets, looking at other Salmon to swim his way.<br /><br />One thing I can say for The Lovely Bones was that it had many asthetically pleasing parts. There were the portions where we saw the place in-between, and these were rich and vibrant. You could see the Peter Jackson of new in this, with his directive toward special effects here. I also liked the narration that the girl added to the mix, making the story touching and sad for everyone involved. You could feel her plight as she watched life pass her by, and you could see her worry about those people she cared about but could do nothing to comfort.<br /><br />On the flipside of this, I thought that the movie really played down some of what had transpired. When i call a child killing a visually appealing movie, it seems like an odd thing to say. Still, the PG-13 label says a lot about what you should expect - and that is sad considering how well the characters come to life. From the father to the killer, I thought there was a lot to be explored. Still, with the the time ticking away, I knew little about the killer in this and, well, I thought this was somewhat important. I know it was her tale and I know that it was aiming for a different level but, in the end, the killer wasn't painted in the light I thought he should have been.<br /><br />All this said, the movie was still good and I still liked it and would say watch it. I thought it had a lot to offer to someone and I cannot say I didn't enjoy the film. I thought the ending, like a spin on a Karma-laced wheel, was a little much and I really didn't like that. I would watch but buying - that's another matter altogether.</p></body></html>

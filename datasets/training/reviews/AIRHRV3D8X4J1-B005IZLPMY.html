<meta name="summary" content="Captain America was much better than I expected."></head><body><p>After watching all the superhero movies as of late I was pleasently surprised at how good Captain America The First Avenger is. Thor and Green Lantern were good, but Captain America was much better in my opinion. Although the twist at the end with him being in modern day America is sure to make me enjoy the next film that much more. The movie is about a young soldier named Steve Rogers who volunteers to undergo a series of experiments for the US army Super Soldier program. After transforming him into a Super Soldier the rest is history and Captain America becomes the First Avenger,<br /><br />The "Captain America: The First Avenger" Blu-ray Disc is presented in 1080p high definition with English 7.1 DTS HD Master Audio, French 5.1 Dolby Digital, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital, Portuguese 5.1 Dolby Digital and English Audio Description with English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles.  The digital copy is presented with an English Audio track. I have to thank Paramount for not screwing over the fans and giving us a real Digital Copy thats compatible with iTunes and works on iPhones and iPads. Warner Brothers Green Lantern digital copy was a joke and did not allow a iTunes download only a streaming gimmick through flixster known as the ultraviolet digital copy. The video and sound are top notch and although the film was not filmed in 3D it still looks decent in 3D, but I prefer the 2D version as to me it just looks better.<br /><br />Copy Combo Pack Breakdown<br />Blu-ray/Blu-ray 3D version/DVD/Digital :<br />Blu-ray<br /><br />-Feature film with commentary by director Joe Johnston, director of photography Shelly Johnson and editor Jeff Ford<br /><br />-"Marvel One-Shot: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer"<br /><br />-Featurettes: "Outfitting a Hero," "Howling Commandos," "Heightened Technology," "The Transformation," "Behind the Skull," "Captain America Origins," "The Assembly Begins"<br /><br />-Deleted Scenes with commentary by director Joe Johnston, director of photography Shelly Johnson and editor Jeff Ford<br /><br />-Trailers</p></body></html>

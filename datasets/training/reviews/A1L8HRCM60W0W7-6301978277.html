In its time, perhaps the predicament of its characters may have been outrageous (drag dressing in the "square" America of the 50s, the unawashed depiction of the chicago mob/jazz scene etc) but it is contentious whether it would appeal to viewers of all generations and affinities. <p>That is not to say that the movie is not a hilarious charmer. Despite some longueurs, especially before we reach with Joe (Curtis) and Jerry (Lemmon) to Florida or towards the end of the movie when romance is allowed to flourish at the expense of comedy, I would recommend this to anyone in a blink -- even those who dread "old" movies. <p>For one thing, Lemmon is very, very funny and convincing; I find Curtis a little staid but interesting in his role overall; and the movie has some pretty funny situational gags that hit the right notes. But as the title on the Amazon page suggests, this really is an out-and-out Monroe flick who is arguably in the most vivacious DumbBlonde number of her career. Do they make woman like that anymore? <p>Secondly, in its romanticism, SLIH bristles with the clever sexual innuendo of yore, a certain finesse that is clearly amiss in the in-your-face adoloscent comedies of our times (Something About Mary, American Pie, etc). Much of the dialog between Monroe and Curtis/Lemmon is priceless. <p>Thirdly, one facet of the movie that gets crowded out by all the celebrations of Marilyn and all the gags is that this was a *real* gangster movie even before the Mario Puzos of the world had written their first word about Corleone. I wonder if Billy Wilder was kidding about "Hot" or about setting the movie in 1929 Chicago. The garage massacre scene, the opening police shootout etc are all a must-see for anyone interested in the reality of those times (the beginnings of organized "mob", Prohibition etc).<p>Whether one sees this as a top humour flick of all time or not, this still remains a classic in its own right, with some legendary comedy numbers from great names of Hollywood. Highly recommended to own, not just to rent.</p></body></html>

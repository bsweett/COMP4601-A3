<meta name="summary" content="Army of Darkness"></head><body><p>Sam Raimi's "Army of Darkness" is one of the best horror-comedy movies ever made. Bruce Campell is very funny in this movie and delivers some of the most memorable one-liners ever said.(Play Duke Nukem on the PC and you'll hear Bruce Campell's lines from this movie in the game.) The story is well written and paced very well. The acting is spotty but the main characters do the job nicely. I loved this movie and would recommend it to any one who loves an off the wall adventure. Get it on DVD.<br /><br />Like Sam Raimi (the director of AOD), I prefer the Theatrical Cut. The director's cut is interesting though, because we get to see more scenes with Evil Ash, a love scene between Shiela and Ash, more scenes with the Mini-Ash's, an alternate opening to the movie, an extended version of the final battle scene, and the original "apocalypse" ending.<br /><br />P.S. If you're looking for a commentary for this movie, check out the Director's Cut disc(s).</p></body></html>

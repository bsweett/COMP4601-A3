<meta name="summary" content="Better Than It Claims To Get"></head><body><p>"As Good As It Gets" is one of the best comedies released in 1997.  The plot of a man with OCD and a struggling waitress builds brilliantly as the movie continues.  As much as many may dislike the lead man, he is highly laughable.  Such comedy combines well with drama at the right places to give it the added flavor.  It combines attitude, laughter, romance, and family.  This movie rightfully earned seven Oscar nominations including Best Picture.<p>Two of those nominations became winners: Jack Nicholson for Best Actor and Helen Hunt for Best Actress.  Nicholson's role has the intensity that gives this film the added comedy.  His research into his character's disease and his characteristics showcase very well.  As always, no words can express how terrific his acting is.  Helen Hunt's role gives the film the drama it needs without removing the comedy.  Her performance is enough to make an audience cry.  Greg Kinnear's Oscar nominated role as a depressed gay man is one of the best performances of his career.  All the other actors also performed wonderfully: Jamie Kennedy, Skeet Ulrich, Cuba Gooding Jr., and many more(even the dog).<p>"As Good As It Gets" is a great movie for those who are looking for a unique comedy.  Everybody will be entertained.</p></body></html>

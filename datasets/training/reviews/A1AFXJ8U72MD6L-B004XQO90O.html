<meta name="summary" content="BETTER THAN I THOUGHT"></head><body><p>Tale of a semi-amnesiac man who finds himself in the Source Code, the means of reliving/living the 8 minutes of the life of another (if the right things come about, that is) in an alternative timeline/parallel universe.  In this tale a military man is made to return back to a train because of a terrorist attack that will only lead to bigger hits on the city of Chicago.  Twists are better than expected and the various "rewinds" to the last 8 minutes on the train are sometimes interesting.  Michelle Monaghan is made up prettily but she's underused compared to her acting in KISS KISS BANG BANG. STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus; SCI FI IDEA/POSSIBILITIES: B; OVERALL GRADE: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: mid August 2011.</p></body></html>

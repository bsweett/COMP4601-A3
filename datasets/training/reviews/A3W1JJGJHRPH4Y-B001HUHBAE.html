<meta name="summary" content="Good Police Procedural"></head><body><p>The movie is very good in what it tries to do. Since the Zodiac killer is never caught, the movie never goes beyond what is actually known about the killer. The movie allows you to see the murders, but you never see the murderer. You learn how the police picked up the few facts about the murderer and even that evidence has conflicting interpretations. There was a partial fingerprint at one of the crime scenes, but it was never matched with anyone. Was it planted? The handwriting was never matched with anyone. Did the murderer masked his handwriting somehow?<br /><br />The movie delves into obsessiveness and celebrity. We never find out what exactly drives Graysmith, we are just along for the ride. What a ride! The movie is taut and suspenseful. It seems long with some almost false endings. The ending is satisfying even though you never know who the killer us.<br /><br />The acting by Gyllenhaal, Downey and Ruffalo is very good. The scenery is great. The movie is violent, but not overly so. Nothing like "Silence of the Lambs."  The humor comes naturally out of the interpersonal interactions. It is a very good mystery.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Another superlative Clooney performance....possible spoilers...."></head><body><p>This is a good, though not great film.  Its plot is rather predictable (especially the ending), the dialogue is OK, and the supporting characters (especially Tilda's Swinton character) are terribly under written.  But, on the good side, the film is worth seeing for George Clooney.  He gives a wonderful performance here.  He's good in everything he's done (even in the awful Batman and Robin).  Clooney, I think, is very underrated as an artist/actor.  I think he's the best, or at least one of the best, actors working in Hollywood today.  He's got the "movie star" down pat, but he's actually a great actor.  He wouldn't have been out of place in old Hollywood, he's that good.<br /><br />As for the film, the central idea of a "cleaner" like Michael Clayton is fascinating.  It's a shame that the film really doesn't jump into more ambiguous territory.  The movies goes the usual evil corporation route vs. a corporate guy who doesn't want to take it anymore.  It's an entertaining film, never boring, but it just skims the surface in a rather predictable fashion.  Sydney Pollack gives another good performance, but I was really disappointed in Tilda Swinton's performance.  She simply wasn't given anything to do.  She's a great actress, but her role is so simplistically written that even she can't bring anything to it.  I was very surprised when she won Best Supporting Actress.  So, the film is worth a rent, sure.  But it's not a masterpiece by any means.</p></body></html>

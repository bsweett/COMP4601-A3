Aniston is likeable, but doesn't really blow you away with her performance.  Ruffalo has some funny lines, and MacLaine is a hoot as the grandmother.  Costner does his charming bit well.  The story basically involves a young woman(Aniston) who is engaged to a lawyer(Ruffalo).  They are coming home for the marriage of her sister.  Aniston is very uncertain of herself and of her engagement.  When she learns that her family might be the basis for the book/movie "The Graduate", she goes out to find the man who bedded her grandmother and mother and could possibly be her father.  After that, things fall flat for me.  This one is not for me.</p></body></html>

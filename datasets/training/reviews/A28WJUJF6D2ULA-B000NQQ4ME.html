<meta name="summary" content="Great But It Had One Fatal Flaw"></head><body><p>This was among the greatest films released in this decade. I loved its setting amid lush and savage jungles. Its vivid and violent depictions of life among the great Maya were as nothing done in Hollywood in a generation. The exciting story this motion picture told kept its rapt audience on the edge of its seat through a lengthy running time. Right up to the very end I was in love with Mel Gibson's latest cinematic accomplishment: and then in the last five minutes I was confronted with an anachronism so overpowering it shattered the suspension of disbelief that had me feeling I was witnessing the actual Mayan civilization somehow delivered onscreen. I will not be so rude as to cite the flawed intrusion here, nor was it enough to make me hesitate to give this film a well-deserved five-stars, but I would like to ask Mel Gibson what on earth he was thinking to have introduced something so historically inaccurate as...as what he did. That left me genuinely saddened and very definitely puzzled. I recommend Apocalypto to anyone with an interest in ancient America, but I would like to hit Mel Gibson upside the head with a history book.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of Tom Hanks' Best Films"></head><body><p>I have been a huge Tom Hanks fan for many years and I have seen many of his movies, but I rate "Cast Away" as one of the best films he has ever made.  Directed by Robert Zemeckis (also the director of Forrest Gump), this film provides a touching look at love and the will to survive.<br /><br />Hanks stars as Chuck Noland, a FedEx employee, and Helen Hunt stars as Kelly, Chuck's fiancee.  On Christmas Eve, Chuck is scheduled to fly to the Far East on FedEx business, but while in flight, the plane encounters a terrible storm and they are forced to deviate from their original flight plan.  This course change takes them over 400 miles off course.  Even with the coruse change, the storm is still raging, and soon, the plane, damaged greatly by the effects of the storm, plunges into the Pacific Ocean.  Chuck is the only survivor.<br /><br />For the next four years, Chuck is forced to struggle to survive on a deserted island far away from any shipping lanes or air routes.  He even draws a face on a volleyball from a FedEx package that washed up from the crash.  Naming the volleyball "Wilson", it becomes a companion for Chuck, who uses it to converse with and vent frustration.  Tired of fighting to survive on the island, Chuck finally decides to construct a raft which will hopefully be strong enough to get past the huge waves that surround the island.  With great strength and determination, Chuck finally makes it past the waves, but now he must hope for rescue on the open water.  After drifting for over 500 miles, Chuck is finally picked up by a ship and returned to civilization.<br /><br />Upon returning home, he realizes that much of his former life has changed.  He is told that his fellow FedEx employees held a funeral for him when they thought he was dead, and his former fiancee Kelly is now married to another man and has a child of her own.  Chuck and Kelly meet and they profess that they still love one another, but Chuck realizes that they could never be together after so much had happened to both of them.<br /><br />The ending is very symbolic to the message of the entire film.  It shows Chuck standing in a crossroads trying to decide which direction to go.  He is also probably trying to decide which direction to take with his life as well.<br /><br />This is a great movie.  Tom Hanks is excellent as Chuck, and Helen Hunt gives a good performance as Kelly.  The scenes on the island are a little unusual because there is very little dialogue, but the message contained within these scenes is very powerful.  Watching Chuck struggle to do such regular and mundane things as light a fire or catch a fish are made even that much more remarkable without dialogue.  It allows the viewer to focus completely at the task Chuck is trying to complete.  I thought this aspect was very interesting to watch.  Other symbolic things in the movie included Chuck casually lighting a lighter and remembering his struggles trying to make fire, and picking up a crab leg and then immediately putting it back down after eating them for so long.<br /><br />I give this movie my absolute highest recommendation.  Tom Hanks is excellent and the story is terrific.  Watch and see how one man's courage and will to live conquer all obstacles.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Kraaken Attacks Pirates, Details at 9"></head><body><p>Hollywood these days seems to work along the lines of monkeys in a room with typewriters producing Shakespeare.  Eventually something truly great, exciting, and visually rewarding emerges and everyone rejoices.  The first Pirates of the Caribbean film seemed like one such instance of cinematic brilliance, an amazing and unexpected movie that reminded people that big studios can consciously make good flicks.<br /><br />However, when I heard that two more Pirates films were in the works, I winced with expectant misery of being subjected to a rushed and unfullfilling trilogy.  Would the care (and necessary budget) be applied to these films?  Happily, if Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is any indication, this series should end up being the most amazing and entertaining movie series of the decade.<br /><br />Why should folks go see this movie?  Three words:  Captain Jack Sparrow.  Johnny Depp's reprisal of the equillibrium challenged pirate should (if there's any justice in the world) lead to a second Academy Award nomination for the same character.  Jack Sparrow is quickly becoming the new James Bond, in terms of name recognition.  The difference is NO ONE ELSE could play Jack Sparrow, so (hopefully) this series shouldn't be driven into the ground like 007.<br /><br />I've been saying the word series alot in this review and there is a reason for that.  Amongst the enormous pile of things the film makers got right, with the first two movies, is the presentation.  Folks, a long time ago people would watch serials in their theaters before the feature presentation.  Ongoing stories that kept people coming back to the movies.  Pirates of the Caribbean is a feature length serial, with all the action, drama, mystery, humor, and this time around, horror that any movie fan could want.<br /><br />What else was done right?  How about the special effects.  Obviously this is a movie about pirates but there be monsters here as well.  In fact, there's a whole pirate crew of damned souls in servitude to Davy Jones, all of which have characteristics of some sea going creature.  Davy Jones himself (played vividly and unforgettably by Bill Nighy) bears an unmistakable resemblance to an octopi, complete with flowing, squirming, and tentacled locks.  The SFX are both gross and gorgeous, any worries about topping the moonlight skeletons from Curse of the Black Pearl should be keelhauled immediately.<br /><br />But wait, there's more.  This movie has some of the most entertaining action sequences in any film I've ever seen.  Gore Verbinski should be the new go-to guy for action in Hollywood.<br /><br />Keira Knightley really vamps it up this go around, clearly she's grown with her character (even if she's more on the sidelines this time).  Sexy, thy name is Keira.<br /><br />No cracks about the Kraaken.  The mythical beasty makes several sizeable appearances with many loving nods, er, tentacle wags toward Ray Harryhausen.  The Kraaken is one gigantic, angry, and hungry sea monster that adds to the rewatchability factor at least ten fold.<br /><br />A word of caution to parents who might want to bring their little ones to see this.  First, it's almost three hours long.  Second, it pushes the limits of the pg-13 rating.  This movie might be too intense for the kids.  Aww, who am I kidding.  Pirates of the Caribbean is a movie worth letting your children have nightmares over.  They'll thank you when they're older.<br /><br />If you're looking for rip roaring fun at the movies this summer Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is the film to see.  100% Buckle Swash Guarantee.<br /><br />P.S. In the immortal words of Captain Jack Sparrow "You Smell Funny".</p></body></html>

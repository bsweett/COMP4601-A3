We later learn that there is going to be an interschool magical olympics.  (It may be dangerous, and someone could even get killed.) We learn one of the great hypocrisies in this setting. (It's ok to have interschool or international games and tournaments, as long as its our school our country that wins.)<br /><br />While Harry is under 17 and too young to participate, his name ends up chosen to participate. Nice mystery to start things off. The cold, but virtuous Snape knows that something is not right. But he suspects that it may be easier to know what is going on if they let Harry participate. Very quickly, I have to admit I like the new Dumbledore. (Michael Gambon)<br /><br />In this movie, we start to see Harry, Ron, and Hermione having disputes. (Ron actually curses at Harry in this one.)  But like true friends, they put their disputes aside and move on. Good thing since this 4th chapter is getting dark.<br /><br />We also see that Neville still bumbles, but we can see that his character is getting interesting. He dances very well (to the surprise of a few people). He gets a date for the ball before Harry or Ron. And at one point, his immense knowledge of plants and herbs proves really useful to Harry at a crucial point.<br /><br />Before the final event of the tournament, Harry again has a dispute with Snape. (Snape suspects Harry of stealing his supplies.) This leads to a bitter exchange of remarks. And then the 'find the cup in the maze' contest turns out to have a VERY SURPRISING AND CATASTROPHIC end.<br /><br />There is a great climax as Snape is once again at Dumbledore's side as they quell at least part of the tragic situation. There is a notable sadness that ends this 4th chapter.<br /><br />If you read the book, you will undoubtedly miss how Snape and Dumbledore try to communicate with the obtuse Fudge about the return of a threat. You may also miss the uneasy reconciliation between Snape and Sirius. But overall, they did a great job of fitting the book into 2 hours and change.</p></body></html>

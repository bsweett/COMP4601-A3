I admit I like some of his stuff, like &quot;The World According to Garp,&quot; &quot;The Dead Poets Society,&quot; and, although I will deny it if asked directly, &quot;Toys.&quot; But far too often, the frenetic comedian's films leave me feeling slightly nauseated. When a loved one wanted to watch &quot;One Hour Photo&quot; with me, I inwardly scoffed. I really haven't watched anything from Williams in some time, but I figured it would be extremely rude to ignore yet again my significant other's cinematic choice for the evening. Fortunately, she finally picked something I could get into. &quot;One Hour Photo&quot; is definitely not your normal Robin William's fare. The comedian, who has been looking to break out of his comedy straitjacket for years, really delivers the goods with this creepy yarn about an obsessive retail employee stalking a young family. William's performance here is so good that you wonder why he hasn't tried something this daring before. Gone is the performer's spastic, eardrum shattering personality so often seen when he appears on a talk show or in a stand up concert. Instead, we see a subdued, angry Robin Williams capable of inducing nightmares.<p>Williams plays Seymour &quot;Sy&quot; Parrish, a lonely, middle-aged photo shop employee who has nothing in his life except the job. He is a one-hour photo development guy who works at one of those big chain department stores that sit on every other street corner across the country. One benefit of Sy's job is that he gets to know many of his customers on a first name basis, which for him constitutes his only interaction with other human beings. Parrish isn't married, doesn't have children or friends, and lives a rather bleak existence in a dim apartment. He doesn't have anything really except the copies of other people's pictures he clandestinely steals from the photo department. Parrish's favorite photos are from the Yorkin family: consisting of mother Nina, father Will, and son Jake. Nina and Jake have been coming into the photo lab for years to get their pictures developed, and Sy has taken quite a shine to them. Jake even refers to Parrish as &quot;Sy, the photo guy,&quot; a moniker Seymour takes as quite a compliment. Heck, after awhile he even feels like part of the family, so much so that he covers one whole wall of his apartment with stolen pictures of the Yorkins. If Sy cannot live with his adopted family, at least he can bring them into his own house and relive the family's most precious moments. The Yorkins look like the perfect little family on paper, and it isn't too long before Sy starts to step over the line. He &quot;accidentally&quot; runs into Nina Yorkin at the mall where the two engage in small talk, which, although meaning little to Nina, means the world to Sy. Then Jake &quot;accidentally&quot; runs across Parrish one day after school, when the photo guy just happens to bring the child a gift.<p>Parrish's world becomes inseparable from the Yorkin's lives, to the point that he begins following them around every chance he gets. Sy has plenty of spare time on his hands because he loses his job at the photo mart after his boss fires him for stealing pictures. The loss of the job is devastating, but even more destructive to Parrish's fragile mental state is the sudden discovery of imperfection in the &quot;perfect&quot; Yorkin household. Nina and Will have problems, specifically over Jake and the father's inability to connect with his son. One problem leads to many more when Will Yorkin decides to take a dangerous step outside of his marriage and Sy Parrish is there to teach the sort of lesson no one could ever forget. The conclusion is a shocker because it takes a different approach from the usual stalker/obsessive person film. <p>I liked &quot;One Hour Photo.&quot; Obviously, William's take on a guy who snaps psychologically is radically different from many of his other film roles. Sy Parrish is creepy and disconnected, and Williams successfully reveals to us the inner turmoil felt by this individual. Just as neat was the chain store where Sy worked. The place is so sterile, bright, and obsessively organized that I loved looking at the place whenever they showed it. Parrish's apartment with the hundreds of pictures on the wall gives you the chills when you see it, especially later when Sy goes on his rampage and the police find the pictures with Will Yorkin's face scratched out on every single snapshot. The best scene in the film was when we see Sy snooping around the Yorkin house and the family suddenly arrives home just in time to see...well, it's best that you watch the movie yourself to discover how this scene plays out. &quot;One Hour Photo&quot; has some unforgettable moments.<p>The few problems with the movie have little to do with the DVD release, which boasts a Charlie Rose interview with Williams, some behind the scenes stuff, and an interesting menu screen. After watching the &quot;Anatomy of a Scene&quot; featurette on the disc, I realized that some of the messages the makers of &quot;One Hour Photo&quot; attempted to pass on to the viewer didn't exactly work. The scene in question involved Sy's first meeting with Will Yorkin in the department store. The director goes on and on about how the store represents a type of heaven to Parrish and how he proves his power over Yorkin by summoning help on the store intercom. I must have missed that when I watched the movie and I am not sure many viewers perceived that scene, or others, as the producers intended. Despite that, this movie is a must see for Robin Williams fans and a should see for all others.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Moral man in an immoral world"></head><body><p>Hotel Rwanda starred Don Cheadle who played Paul Rusesabagina, Hutu man in charge of a four star Beligan hotel who protected nearly 1,200 Tutsi refugees from being massacre by his fellow tribemen during the Rwandan Civil War. This was the war which our liberal press and our then president, Bill Clinton, purposely choose to ignored despite of its genocidical nature.<br /><br />Don Cheadle did a wonderful job as a moral man in a very immoral position. Instead of taking the easy path for safety, he choose to take a route of human responsiblity by protecting those who could not protect themselves. Cheadle's effort clearly earned him the nomination for Academy Award for best actor. He was well supported by Sophie Okonedo who played his wife and also earned a nomination for best supporting actress. There are genuine chemisty between the two and their relationship create the foundation for why Don Cheadle's character did what he did. In simple terms, the film worked because Cheadle's character was believable despite of the fact that this movie was based on a true story.<br /><br />The film did bring out the Rwandan Civil War to the movie theaters. Script did have to called to attention the differences between the Tutsi and Hutu since most Americans probably don't know or really care. But casual ease that these Africans slaughtered each other may surprised many people.<br /><br />The film itself wasn't that high of a caliber. The movie was definitely too long, Nick Nolte was badly miscast as the UN military commander and the script was underwritten as most of the characters in the movie appears to be somewhat lightweight. Only Don Cheadle's character was totally fresh out and thanks to the great work by that actor, Paul Rusesabagina came alive. Sophie Okonedo brought her character alive despite of having a pretty limited character. For that, she earned her nomination for an Oscar.<br /><br />This movie is a pretty decent film but only because the two lead actors were so good. Without Don Cheadle or Sophie Okonedo to carry the load, this film could easily be one of them easily forgettable made for TV flicks that would get three days of hype by the network and disappeared.</p></body></html>

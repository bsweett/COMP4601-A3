<meta name="summary" content="Who Was That Masked Man?"></head><body><p>You know something is wrong when the worst character in "The Green Hornet" is The Green Hornet himself. As portrayed by Seth Rogen, we see a twelve-year-old trapped in a man's body, a bratty and talkative megalomaniac that does none of the dirty work and truly has no idea what he's doing. Rogen, who is also the co-writer and one of the executive producers, is not only tragically miscast but has also written his character badly; rather than a bold and debonair crime fighter, as he was in the original 1930s radio program, The Green Hornet is now a broadly defined goofball, a spoiled and whiny jerk who can do little more than say how cool something looks before getting his butt kicked. In the annals of pulp fiction, few characters have been this unlikeable, unimpressive, and cowardly.<br /><br />The unfortunate thing is that this "new" and "improved" Green Hornet sets off a chain reaction that brings down the rest of the film. This is bad because all the ingredients were there; Cameron Diaz was smart and sexy, Jay Chou was fast and fierce, the action was entertaining, the special effects were convincing, and for the first time in ages, the 3D process was full and immersive. For God's sake, they even got Christoph Waltz, who so effortlessly earned a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for "Inglourious Basterds." But when the best you can do is have the title character run away from a crime scene shouting, "Save me, Kato!" when he's supposed to be a ruthless vigilante, then something has gone terribly wrong.<br /><br />In the film, Rogen plays Britt Reid, the son of James Reid (Tom Wilkinson), the editor in chief of a Los Angeles newspaper called "The Daily Sentinel." Still upset over the death of his mother, and bitter over his father's constant disapproval, Britt lives his life as an irresponsible slacker who likes to drink, party, and embarrass his father by ending up on the front page of the morning newspaper. James dies unexpectedly, apparently the result of a bee sting; Britt must now take over as editor in chief, a position he's neither qualified for nor motivated to take on, mostly because he didn't get along with his father and is disheartened by the public outcry over his death.<br /><br />Even though he fired all of his father's staff, he rehires Kato (Chou) simply because he makes a damn fine cup of coffee. But Kato has other talents - he's an inventor and a mechanic, and I'll bet one of his creations is a time machine because there's no way a person can single handedly assemble a car so quickly. He also likes classical music, is skilled in the ways of martial arts, and possesses an inhuman ability to scan thugs and pinpoint their weapons. I will now skip a number of inconsequential details and get to the part where the two decide to become crime fighters. Their angle: They will wear masks, pose as criminals, and infiltrate the lairs of real criminals. In no time, Kato has rigged up a muscle car dubbed the Black Beauty with bulletproof glass, virtually indestructible steel, missiles, machine guns, and other various overkills. Kato then supplies Britt's vigilante alter ego with a name: The Green Hornet.<br /><br />Britt secretly relies on his newly hired secretary, the beautiful Lenore Case (Diaz), for tips on behaving more like a criminal, since she's a serious journalist with a degree in criminology. He creates his own publicity by publishing stories about The Green Hornet in "The Daily Sentinel," much to the chagrin of assistant editor in chief Mike Axford (Edward James Olmos). The articles catch the attention of Benjamin Chudnofsky (Waltz), a heartless Russian mobster who has control over all of the city's crime families. If you know what's good for you, you won't tell him he isn't scary, nor will you fumble pronouncing his name (an uncredited James Franco learns both lessons the hard way). Also alerted is Los Angeles District Attorney Frank Scalon (David Harbour), whose efforts to rid the city of crime have been undermined by The Green Hornet.<br /><br />I'm making this movie sound a lot better than it actually is. In the hands of Seth Rogen and director Michel Gondry, the fast-paced and entertaining plot is overshadowed by the jokey and immature antics of the main character, a man so thoroughly off putting that I found myself going against everything movies like this stand for and wishing his secret identity would be exposed. How often do we root for the sidekick instead of the hero? "The Green Hornet" makes it impossible to do otherwise; Kato is smarter, braver, more skilled, and way more charismatic than Britt ever was. What a mockery of character and tone. Rogen can be a good actor (see "Funny People"), and he can also be a good writer (see "The Simpsons" episode "Homer the Whopper"), but here, he errs, and he errs badly.</p></body></html>

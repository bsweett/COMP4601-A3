<meta name="summary" content="No DVD collection is complete without it."></head><body><p>This DVD is the ultamit, Back to the Future DVD couldent get better. Back To The Future-A pure classic great special futures and wondeful outcome.<br /><br /> Back to the Future II- More Dark but is fun becuase you get a peek t the posible future someday and how Mardy and Doc go to the future just to change the outcome of there kids but are on a new mission once the time machine falls into the wrong hands!.<br /><br />Back to the Future III-Alough this focuses on Doc the most I think it would be more intresting if they traveled back to Colonial times during the witch craft area and they get involed in that somehow, but no matter still a classic.<br />  But all in all definitly buy it!!! its a little steamy on the price but you must own it!!...</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I bought the cheap DVD version because ...."></head><body><p>I've been wanting to see this movie for years.  Unable to find it for rent, I decided it was better to buy the cheapest DVD version available that kept the original soundtrack.  Thanks to countless reviews on Amazon, I avoided the '30th Anniversary Edition" which is supposed to be a butchering of the original cut.  I decided against the Elite version because it was too expensive, and would have kicked myself if I hated the movie when it arrived.<p>After watching my chosen "Good Times" DVD, I am glad I spent the very low amount to buy this movie.  While the transfer isn't brilliant, it's far from poor.  It's watchable, and the original soundtrack is satisfactory.  The movie itself ended up not really being my cup of tea so I'm glad I didnt opt for the Elite expensive version.  <p>The "Good Times" version states that its Digitally Remastered.  I think they've done an okay job on the transfer.  Like I said earlier, it's not great, but for [money], what more could you ask for if you a first timer to this movie?</p></body></html>

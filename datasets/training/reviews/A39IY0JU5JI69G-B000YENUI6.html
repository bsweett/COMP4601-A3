<meta name="summary" content="Stunning!"></head><body><p>I have lived my entire life avoiding violent films--westerns, war movies, anything with guns---I stayed away from.  Two years ago a friend wanted to see A History of Violence and I accompanied her....not a film I would have normally chosen.  My!  Perhaps I discovered a hidden appetite for violence?  I'm not sure about that, but I certainly discovered a hearty appreciation for Viggo Mortensen.<br /><br />So, today, when I had a break and I saw that Eastern Promises was at a theater near me, I went to see it.  I had not read reviews, (something I recommend) but I figured if Mortensen was in it, it must be worth seeing.<br /><br />I was not disapointed!  As amazing as his performance was in "Violence" this totally eclipses it.  His posture, his facial expressions, his voice, as the Russian punk are nothing short of wondrous.  If he doesn't win this year's Oscar I will feel about the same way as when the ballots were counted at the last presidential election.<br /><br />Yes it is violent but it works to highlight the extremes of the character.  Without seeing what he goes through "in service to" the Russian mafia, we can't appreciate the heights of his actions.  The simple kiss between Mortensen and Watts...that's all the romance we get here...is enough to light up the whole theater.<br /><br />Yes, the bathhouse scene is amazing!  And worth all the talk!<br /><br />Despite the occasional unsparing violence, this is a totally enjoyable film!  The story unfolds in a suspensful way from the get-go.  We don't know who the good guys are from the bad guys.  I loved the complexity of the Mafia's chief ...who delicately pulled pink rose petals to decorate the cake of the birthday of a hundred year old fellow emigree...<br />yet was the cause of suffering of hundreds of young girls.  The scene of the older Russian women singing along to an old folk tune is quite touching.<br /><br />All in all, this is a masterful film and I heartily recommend it.  And did I mention that Viggo Mortensen was extraordinary?!</p></body></html>

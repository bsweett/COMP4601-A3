I expected this to be a quick fix SAW type movie directed by the interesting Eli Roth and what we get is a 21st century rendition of something like "Last House on the Left" multiplied by "I spit on your Grave" plus a bit of Hitchcock in the mix and some Jap horror and we got ourselves an impressive movie that was a hell of a lot better than what it should have been. In fact, next to "The Descent", this is one of the best horrors I have seen in a long long time, another genre reviver and a lot more than just the popcorn fodder that SAW dished up. Memorable scenes include the goofy accountant type sadist, an eye scene, messy heels, a train and some choky vomit. I highly recommend that anyone who has the stomach for it, go watch it, and certainly those who have a taste for the aforementioned type of splatter masterpieces, well what more can we say than Roth knows how to do it right... and with two severed fingers... I mean... a cherry on top. It even had loads of high suspense towards the end. Yeah, I dig this one like I would a grave for an airhead hooker who just got her cap bust for my giggles. This indie movie is all like that kind of sensibility. Not for the masses. Oh the joy!</p></body></html>

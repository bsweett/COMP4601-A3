It abounds with numerous substantial themes, some classical, some Shakespearean, others mythological.  "Hulk" also dives into psychological trauma from Oedipal and paternal conflict,  emotional and psychological abuse and repression. It even explores the essence of true identity  - is "Bruce Banner" merely the facade, and "Hulk" the real personality, as his own megalomaniacal father Dr. David Banner (Nick Nolte) mentions late in the film- and the intoxicating freedom of self-discovery. The movie is a skillfully constructed blend of other literary and cinematic works, from the obvious ("Frankenstein", "Beauty and the Beast", "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde") to the more arcane, bizarre, and obscure ("Altered States," "The Island of Dr. Moreau," "Swamp Thing!", and yes, I do dare declare it, "Superman: the Movie"). Ang Lee has attempted to create an epic drama from a deceptively simplistic and superficial "creature" and has succeeded admirably. All the characters reveal vulnerability, dimension, and soul. I was transfixed watching this spectacle, and the Hulk, come to triumphant life.<br /><br />Anyone, I believe, caring to invest a bit of thought and interest in the movie's unfolding should not have had any reason to be bored. In this buffet of a movie, the first 45 minutes of exposition were not merely filler, but the essential meat fleshing out the enigma that the reserved, diffident, frustrated, and emotionally constipated Bruce Banner is. Eric Bana managed to convey this emotional repression and yet still evoke my sympathy, just as David Jansen did as Richard Kimble in "The Fugitive", yet another inspiration. His interaction with Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly) was fascinating and seminal because although she claimed to be disillusioned with Bruce's impassivity, inevitably she could never cut herself away from him because, as the backdrop of her life demonstrated, she, too, is Bruce's alter ego and soulmate, destined to help in his healing and salvation.<br /><br />Despite the various themes swirling around, I feel "Hulk" is ultimately a movie dealing with the triumph of self-discovery, catharsis, and redemption. Bruce was doomed to an eternal prison of self-ignorance and loneliness inflicted by his wildly iconoclastic, obsessed father. Ironically, the gamma radiation gives him the key, because, like the potion in "Swamp Thing", the rays did not transform him so much as made him more of what he truly is. It is as the Hulk that Bruce salvages lost memories of his traumatic childhood. It is as the Hulk that Bruce retaliates against specific tormentors, rather than indiscrimately attack everyone in sight (as a truly mindless monster will). It is as the Hulk that Bruce embraces the heady feeling of power and freedom and begins to examine himself at the same time. Hulk is often described as a "tragic figure" and ample evidence exists of that in the movie, with his anguished roars of wrath and pain, his innocent, soulful stares when he is relatively calm, and, yes, his attempts to put his power to good use (e.g., saving Betty from the freakish Hulk dogs and trying to save the jet from crashing into the Golden Gate Bridge. I think Ang Lee was trying to chronicle the birth of a new "Superman", crude, terrifying, and unrelenting at first, but striving to become a true, caring, FORGIVING, superhero (as he demonstrates when he shakes the soldiers out of the tank turret before destroying it and during his climactic battle with his berserk, "Absorbing Man" father). Ultimately, Ang Lee transcends the tragedy of the Hulk's origin to suggest that, with luck, Bruce/Hulk will overcome their horrific legacy and the uncomprehending hostility of mankind to become a fully contributory and valuable member (not just a scientific genius) of the world.<br /><br />As you can see, I could turn the "Hulk" into a Ph.d dissertation. I am sure some graduate student already has. Yet, lest you think I am some verbose intellectual snob, let me assure you I also enjoyed the Hulk's visceral as well as cerebral pleasure. The entire desert/San Francisco battle sequence was taut, exciting, and exhilarating. The CGI behemoth, I felt, was utterly convincing and compelling, both in close-up and during his prodigious, soaring leaps. Hulk's phenomenal powers themselves are not a curse, as Roger Ebert mentioned in his review, but a blessing in an "inhuman disguise". Hulk revels in his power; during one of his stratospheric leaps, he actually reminded me of Superman in the 1978 movie just soaring through the air for the sheer joy of it.<br /><br />In conclusion, I believe Ang Lee successfully delivered both an intellectual and emotionally stimulating and evocative movie and created a respectful homage to Stan Lee and Jack Kirby's classically archetypal character. And yes, I own the DVD.</p></body></html>

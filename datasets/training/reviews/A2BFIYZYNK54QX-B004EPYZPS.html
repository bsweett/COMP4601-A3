He more or less started out making a splash with the TV show FELICITY which was, to me, a rather antiseptic drama. Then came his next big show ALIAS, which was his first foray into genre-bending TV; a high-octane spy thriller mixed with enough drama to make the characters interesting and enough twists to make the more jaded fans tune in weekly. However, he hit his stride with LOST, a show that was universally beloved as it was confusing, but the plot became somewhat secondary to the characters. That show was populated by so many unforgettable characters that, despite fans' misguided anger over the series finale, the show will be forever ingrained in the viewer's brain. And it was during LOST that Abrams started making his foray into feature films; his first being MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 3. M:I-3 is a better film than I remember it being, while at the same time, fusing perhaps a little too much reality into a rather absurd concept which I think ultimately hurt the film but I certainly can't fault Abrams for trying a different approach to a somewhat stale concept. The next film he did was one of the best pure "Summer" films I've seen in recent years, and that was his reboot of the STAR TREK franchise. It created a genuine love and a strong sense of nostalgia of the original series with a lot of winks and nods, but helped to fashion an entirely new direction for such well-known characters with its one major LOST-like plot twist. It was evident that with series like LOST and FRINGE and films he helped make like the nod-to-Godzilla CLOVERFIELD and then STAR TREK that Abrams, while confident he could create new worlds, he grew up in the era of the Summer Blockbuster, and most of the major filmmakers who grew up during that era usually end up making a film that pays homage to that era. SUPER 8 is Abrams love-letter not only to the era, but also to the master of the Summer Blockbuster (and also my personal favorite filmmaker), Steven Spielberg.<br /><br />Abrams crafts a wondrous, heart-felt, and very well-made tale about a group of youngsters who have banded together in a small Ohio suburb in the late 70's to make a zombie film to submit to a festival, and wind up smack in the middle of a government conspiracy surrounding the escape of an imprisoned alien life-form that puts their entire town at risk. At the center of this tale is the young VFX makeup artist, Joe (a very talented Joel Courtney), a pre-teen who lost his mother recently in an industrial accident. His town-sheriff father, played by the terrific Kyle Chandler, has withdrawn into himself and there is an almost complete disconnect with his son. The other kids making the film are similar to the group of kids we've seen in E.T. or THE GOONIES or any number of Spielberg-ian kid groups, but the young actors and the characters themselves are fleshed out enough to be more than just stock characters. Once the slightly-older Alice (wonderfully played by Elle Fanning) becomes involved in the project, it goes beyond just being a boy's club and the elements of romance and betrayal introduce themselves, particularly from Joe's father since Alice's father (the wonderfully wounded Ron Eldard) may have drunkenly caused the accident that killed Joe's mother. While just the drama of the group and the characters would be enough for one film, that's when Abrams gives us the train crash the kids catch on their Super 8 camera that is the key to the danger and mystery that enshrouds the whole town, and naturally, the danger comes not only from the alien creature, but also from the government, which is embodied by a terrific and menacing performance from Noah Emmerich.<br /><br />As I stated earlier, the film has enough drama and momentum to make an entire film out or either subject (family drama or alien danger), but Abrams, like Spielberg before him, entices us, delights us and ultimately astonishes us with combining these elements into one big smile of a film. I use the phrase 'smile of a film' not because the film is a hilarious blast to watch, because there are a few moments of heart-wrenching emotion and seat-gluing terror. I use it because when we look back on some of the great Summer Films we've seen in our lives, such as STAR WARS, RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, E.T., CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, BACK TO THE FUTURE and JAWS, inevitably we smile because these films represent the very best of this kind of filmmaking and something that has been very noticably absent from many films post-1985 (since the biggest film of 1986 was TOP GUN), and suddenly the Big Summer Blockbuster became a monster. The likes of Spielberg and Lucas and Zemeckis and Donner changed the rules of the game for better or worse, and all of them started with the best of intent, but along the way, character and story took a massive back seat to spectacle and effects and action and money. This is not to necessarily criticize all of the Summer Blockbusters we have gotten since, but on most of them, the luster is lost after the season is done. Whether that's due to the quality of the film or the over-saturation of the Summer Blockbusters (It's all about Opening Weekend grosses now, and it's becoming increasingly rare that a film is #1 for more than one weekend), that subject is up for debate. But there was a time when we could easily look back at the films of a particular summer and say, "That was a great film and it will always be a great film". SUPER 8 is a very passionate love-letter to those times, but it also finds itself with the distinction of being one of those films that wasn't just a great Summer film for 2011, but will be a great Summer film for all time.</p></body></html>

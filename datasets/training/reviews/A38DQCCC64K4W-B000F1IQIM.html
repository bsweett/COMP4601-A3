<meta name="summary" content="A Modern Classic"></head><body><p>This movie loses a little steam near the end, but I have nothing but good things to say about this over the top, ultraviolent, pulp western...Say what you will about Banderas, but he was born to play this part. Plus we get to see Danny Trejo, Steve Buscemi, Quentin Tarantino(his joke is hilarious...), and Salma Hayek in early or first film roles; Rodriguez is a master film technician in every way, and this movie is filled with innovative firefights and camerawork, all furiously put together with his usual trademark editing. The story is pretty bare bones, but it's the creative energy and on-the-mark performances that make this one of my top 10 favorites. Best bar shoot-out ever!! Sure, it's B-grade stuff...but classic nonetheless.</p></body></html>

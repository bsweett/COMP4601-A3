<meta name="summary" content="Hypnotic, But Lacking Substance"></head><body><p>JARHEAD recounts author Anthony Swofford's personal journey through the First Iraqi War of the early 1990s.  Based on his bestselling book of the same name, the movie marches through his experiences from boot camp to the deserts of Iraq, from the uncertainty of being accepted by the Marines to losing his girlfriend to a "Jody" to the harsh realities of civilian losses strewn all around him.  The movie is a hard and unflinching look at that war, and at the men involved in it.<br /><br />Sam Mendes (AMERICAN BEAUTY) directed.  Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Swoff, the principal character, but it's Peter Sarsgaard's protrayal of Troy and Jamie Foxx's no-nonsense approach to Staff Sergeant Sykes that really steal the show.<br /><br />Although off to a rather rocky beginning, with the immediate comparison of Swoff's drill instructor to the one in FULL METAL JACKET, JARHEAD moves quickly into its own rhythm.  The narrative and pacing of the movie is extremely well done and becomes totally hypnotic.  I found myself watching with rapt attention.  Swoff became very real to me, as did Troy.  Jamie Foxx turned in a stellar portrayal of Staff Sergeant Sykes, showing a depth of acting that he isn't often given a chance to do.  He came across as hard, but in one-on-one moments with Swoff, he revealed the dichotomy inherent, I think, in most professional soldiers:  they love what they do, but they're appalled by it at the same time, and even more confused by their love of it.<br /><br />Despite the direction and the acting, though, the substance of the movie seems to be lacking.  The emotion doesn't exactly come out of nowhere at the end, but it definitely goes nowhere.  I know that this is how many of the soldiers felt at the end of that war, but I think it would have helped if we'd gotten to know the characters a little more deeply.  Troy was getting kicked out of the Marines, but why?  Peter Sarsgaard earned a lot of sympathy from me, but I still don't know what he lied about, or why the military felt compelled to kick him out after he was such a good Marine.  That lack of knowledge really hurt at the end of the movie.<br /><br />The HD DVD release offers extremely intense video presentation.  The images are clear and sharp, well-defined.  However, even though the sound separation is done well for surround sound systems, it isn't uncompressed.  With a killer soundtrack laying down the score, the high-def fans willing to buy an enriched product even if they'd already owned a copy of the movie should have gotten that enrichment all the way around.<br /><br />JARHEAD is definitely worth a look from military movie fans, but it's not something that's going to completely satisfy.  Perhaps guys who have actually been over there during the wars will get more out of it, but I just ended up with more questions.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Broken lives"></head><body><p>Broken Flowers is, in many ways, not a typical film for Jim Jarmusch. But then again, what is? After twenty five years of work, Jarmusch is still one of the most original and creative directors in the US. Broken Flowers is not, by any means, his best; it is his most sensitive and most mature, though. Many have blamed Jarmusch of going mainstream on this film. That's partly true - in the sense that it conforms to film-genre norms more than any of his previous films. By that I mean: Dead Man (1995) was a western that was an antithesis to every other western in the world. Ghost Dog (1998) was a gangster film and a samurai film, and at the same time it was absolutely neither. Broken Flowers doesn't actively challenge Hollywood; instead, it's a study in character and in human life. As such, it's the most personal, most beautiful film that Jim had pulled yet, and it manages to do what films like Sideways have tried to do in recent years but just didn't get right.<br /><br />More than it is a triumph for Jarmusch, Broken Flowers is a triumph for Bill Murray, who plays Don Johnston, an aging Don Juan who receives a letter regarding a long lost son, and sets out to find which of his old flames the mother is. Like most of Jarmusch's films, the premise is simple, and the film is slow and minimalist, but the combined strengths of Jarmusch's direction and script and of Murray's performance make it a powerful experienced. Murray, who had spent much of his youth as a successful mainstream comedic actor, had in the last few years, with a chain of critically acclaimed films that included Rushmore, Lost In Translation and The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou, based himself as one of the most talented and intelligent actors at the fringes of Hollywood. His poker-face, which shows none and yet reveals all, comes to wonderful use in the role of Don, which in a way is further development of the character he created in Sofia Coppola's beautiful Lost In Translation, and it may just be the most brilliant performance of his career - yet.<br /><br />The rest of the small cast is absolutely flawless; like in most of Jarmusch's films, in Broken Flowers Don is the only true major character, but he's better defined by the fascinating personalities surrounding him. Four stellar actresses - Sharon Stone, Frances Conroy (Six Feet Under's Ruth Fisher), Jessica Lange and Tilda Swinton, play the women in Don's life, each one shedding her own unique light on him; Jeffrey Wright (Basquiat, Angels in America), one of the most humble and underrated actors in Hollywood today, is fantastic as Don's neighbor Winston; Julie Delpy (Killing Zoe), Alexis Dziena, Christopher McDonald, Pell James and Mark Webber (Hollywood Ending) are all worthy of praise as well.<br /><br />You can say that Jarmusch has gone 'middle of the road', but the fact is that all his marks are here, color and all; and none of it is fake, he's still one of the most sincere and most original creators in America. His unique approach to cinematography, to pacing, to editing and to music (Ethiopian fusion artist Mulatu Astatke does for Broken Flowers what John Lurie did for Down By Law, Neil Young for Dead Man, and RZA for Ghost Dog, and Jarmusch's fusion of music into the film is as seamless as it always is) are fresher and more creative than anything seen in any mainstream film and Broken Flowers is probably the most beautiful film we'll see this year.</p></body></html>

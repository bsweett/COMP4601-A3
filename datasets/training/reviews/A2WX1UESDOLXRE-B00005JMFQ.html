<meta name="summary" content="Flawed But Totally Lovable!"></head><body><p>This movie is a bit longish and could have done without several scenes, but nonetheless is still a fun and sweet film that deserves to be checked out at least once. It's a refreshing romantic comedy-- one that ties together several different love stories that can all be traced back to the Prime Minister, played by Hugh Grant.<p>Some of the love stories include a young boy who is in love with the most popular girl in school, a man in love with his best friend's wife (or the best friend as implied in the beginning), the Prime Minister falling for his secretary, and a writer who falls for his cleaning lady. Some of the love stories (though none of what I mentioned) could have been left out. Some were just a bit much, like the story about the couple who met doing body double work on a film. The scenes are just awkward, and not just because their nude the whole time. Otherwise, the stories create a nice woven effect throughout the film and are incredibly enjoyable and laugh out loud funny.<p>It's well-written and the cast is absolutely amazing. We are charmed with the presence of Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Keira Knightly, and many more. It's a film that will definitely make you smile and realize that &quot;love actually is all around us.&quot; Highly recommended!!</p></body></html>

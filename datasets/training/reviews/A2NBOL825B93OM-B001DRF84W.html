<meta name="summary" content="Hulk? What Hulk?"></head><body><p>&#65533;Hulk&#65533; is an average movie, a very average movie in praticaly all aspects. The plot is only adequate, full of cliches, like the american military in search of the perfect soldier, a very thin love-story, very bad people against very good people, etc., and with the final 15 minutes completely crazy and far-fetched. The characters are well-developed, but this characterization is done almost to the point of being a boring feature of the movie. The special effects overall are quite good. But the funny thing is that the special effects concerning the rendering of the green monster itself are below average. It surely is a drawback in a huge production like this, where a great part of the film is based on a series of images created by computer. I really think that this is not the special-effects crew&#65533;s fault, because I thikn what they intended to create isn&#65533;t possible with the technology they have right now. <p>So, &#65533;Hulk&#65533; should deserve 3 stars at the most. But there are two very interesting things that elevate its rating to four stars. The first thing is director Ang Lee. This taiwanese gentleman surely has the sense and sensibility to manipulate all kinds of images the very ways he wants to. In &#65533;Hulk&#65533;, his direction is very fast-paced, the cinematography is excellent (subtle, not obvious, using of the green colour), and he shot bull&#65533;s eye in using DePalma-esque resources like spliting the screen to re-create a comic-book-like atmosphere. Ang Lee is a master when it comes to create the right atmospheres to his movies. He did so in &#65533;Ice storm&#65533;, &#65533;Sense and sensibility&#65533; and, most of all, in &#65533;Crouching tiger, hidden dragon&#65533;. <p>The second thing is Jennifer Connelly. This stunningly beautiful woman is also a very atalented actress, and Ang Lee could get from her always the right face expressions, the right tons of voice, the right smoothness in acting, creating an almost perfect character in Betty Ross. Sometimes the expression of her eyes alone were enough to carry the whole movie on its back. In fact I was very angry (get it?) when she was not on screen. <p>Also worth of mentioning is Nick Nolte&#65533;s crazy David Banner, but surely the best things about &#65533;Hulk&#65533; are Ang Lee and Jennifer Connelly. So, don&#65533;t expect much, and enjoy the right beauties existent in &#65533;Hulk&#65533;. <p>Grade 8.0/10</p></body></html>

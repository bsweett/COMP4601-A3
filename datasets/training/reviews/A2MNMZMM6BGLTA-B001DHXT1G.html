<meta name="summary" content="Ed Norton Smash Hulk"></head><body><p>The first Hulk movie was better than this Hulk movie. Ed Norton just keeps getting skinnier and his acting abilities seem to need a boost of gamma radiation. I wanted to like this movie because I am a big Marvel Comics fan but this movie just wasn't that good. The casting was pretty poor. William Hurt did a good job as Thunderbolt Ross but Liv Tyler is just an awful actress and delivers every line like she is a 2 year old trapped in a womans body (with big pillowy lips). Tim Roth is a good actor but... why Tim Roth? He is suppose to be a great commando and then he takes his shirt off and he looks like a 3 pack a day horribly unfit homeless person who hasn't had a wash or a good meal in about 5 years. Then when he gets some of the super soldier formula they hilariously try to paint muscles on his horrible body. Also standing by William Hurt he looks to be about 4 feet tall which is ok considering that Ed Norton appears to be about 120 pounds of rippling skin and bones which is about 50 pounds less than his love interest Betty Ross.<br /><br />This movie just wasn't that good. I heard that Norton was not pleased and if you watch the deleted scenes you can see that a lot of the humanity of The Hulk (Banner) ended up on the cutting room floor. I have to disagree. There was nothing in the deleted scenes that shouldn't have been deleted except maybe the extended scene between Hurt and Roth.<br /><br />Watch the first one. It was better and it wasn't that good. But I liked the look of The Hulk in the first one better and I thought the fight scenes and special effects were better. Josh Lucas, Jennifer Conolley, Sam Elliot and Eric Bana were a much better cast too.</p></body></html>

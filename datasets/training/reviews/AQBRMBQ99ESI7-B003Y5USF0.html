I wasn't blown away to the degree of some by the effects but they were good and they did get the point across.<br /><br />The story is of a young researcher of tornados played by Helen Hunt. She runs a budget operation trying to study tornados. She has invented a gizmo to actually get into the heart of the beast and get incredible amounts of data. The catch is that you have to get really close to deploy it. In competition with her is a blowhard who is well financed, arrogant and who has stolen the plans for her gizmo. Into this state of affairs comes the husband, played by Bill Paxton, who wants her to sign the papers to finalize a divorce so he can re-marry. He too is a former tornado researcher. As he tries to get her to sign the papers, he gets sucked back into storm chasing and it is practically required that he get sucked back into the marriage as well.<br /><br />It's well done, interesting, at times funny and at times exciting. Its worth the rental and the purchase.</p></body></html>

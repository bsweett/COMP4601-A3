Dock Ock. man it was so cool on how they did it. and the guy who prtrays Dock Ock looks like the comic book character. I have to give credit to sam raimi on makeing such good movies and finding good actors to play the parts. And if they look like the comic book characters thats a plus. I lOve this movie.</p></body></html>

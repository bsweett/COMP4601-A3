<meta name="summary" content="just Ok at best"></head><body><p>this film reminded me of a few films that were tied together&none of the best elements of those films. this film has some moments,but nothing that merits 2 hours&alot of tired cliches. it was very predictable for the most part&it took a good hour before things even kinda even got going.this is a film that will probably have a part 2 or 3 but not because it was so good,but it worked.it was just a Ok film to me.</p></body></html>

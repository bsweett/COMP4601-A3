<meta name="summary" content="Saw"></head><body><p>Lawrence (Elwes) and Adam (Whannell) wake up chained to pipes in the world's filthiest bathroom.  They have little freedom of movement and cannot even come close to reaching each other.  They do not remember how they got there or know each other.  Their captor (presumably) has left them two saws, an unloaded gun, a tape recorder,  two cigarettes, and a dead body in the middle of the room.  They are victims of the Jigsaw Killer, and that same killer is holding Lawrence's wife and daughter hostage.  At the same time, an ex-cop (Glover) is hunting down the killer, bent on revenge for the murder of his partner.<br /><br />"Saw" is an intense, twisted movie.  It is reminiscent of "Seven" in both mood and atmosphere, and leaves you with about the same feeling when it is all over.  For me, that is good, because I believe "Seven" to be an excellent movie.  "Saw", however, is not at that level...but it is close.  Director James Wan ratchets up the tension with each passing moment until the final scene.  And while the explanation might not hold up as well as the the viewer might like, it was still a hell of a ride.  Elwes especially does an excellent job as a man first confused by his situation, then terrified for his family, then resolute in what needs to be done.<br /><br />"Saw" is a great Halloween movie, and if you are looking for a good scary movie at this time of the year, "Saw" is your best bet.  Highly recommended for horror fans.</p></body></html>

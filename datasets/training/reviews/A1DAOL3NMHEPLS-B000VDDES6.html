<meta name="summary" content="Another goofy Will Ferrell vehicle."></head><body><p>Will Ferrell has a real knack for playing clueless goofballs - in this case a conceited San Diego news anchor, circa 1977 - and he pretty much carries the movie. Christina Applegate handles the lead female role admirably, and she has matured into a real beauty, which makes it all the more enjoyable to watch her onscreen. The story line is thin, to say the least, but there are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments. Worth watching if you want some light entertainment and don't mind some bad language and constant sexual innuendo.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Tom Hanks as you've never seen him before"></head><body><p>Set in the Winter if 1931, ROAD TO PERDITION is director Sam Mendes' follow up to his Oscar winning AMERICAN BEAUTY. ROAD TO PERDITION is based on a graphic novel written by Max Allan Collins and illustrated by Richard Piers Rayner.<br />In a fine departure from his usual roles Tom Hanks plays ruthless gangster Michael Sullivan, who finds his life turned upside down when his son Michael Jr (Tyler Hoechlin) witnesses a bloody murder in which he was an accomplice. As if this isn't bad enough Sullivan also soon finds his own "Family" have issued orders for a hit on him. ("This house is not our home anymore. It's just an empty building" Hanks tells his son). This leads father and son on a cross country trip to evade their pursuers where Michael Sr discovers he may have a chance to turn his life around.<br />Paul Newman deserves a mention as he is sensational as Hanks's father and mentor. He just seems to get better with age. There are a couple of bloody sequences, especially at the climax; but ROAD TO PERDITION is basically a film about loyalty and redemption. The pace is a bit slow in parts but Conrad L. Hall's stunning cinematography more than makes it for it. Well worth seeing.</p></body></html>

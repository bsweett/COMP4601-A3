<meta name="summary" content="The fine line between idealism and insanity"></head><body><p>Crackerjack entertainment - with an insightful "war is crazy" message to go along with it. A company of British soldiers is captured by the Japanese and forced to build a bridge over the Kwai. A battle of wills develops between the Japanese commander (played by Sessue Hayakawa) and the British one (Alec Guinness) over officers' rights; Guinness wins out and virtually takes over command of the camp, getting the bridge built with typical British efficiency.<br /><br />Meanwhile, an American prisoner (William Holden) escapes and returns with a commando unit set on blowing the bridge up. Guinness's ego has so taken over that when he spots the explosive charges and wires on the bridge, and suddenly realizes what's about to happen, he actually tries to stop it from blowing up. But too late: the bridge is blown to smithereens and so are Guinness and Holden. War's madness.<br /><br />Guinness's slide into insanity is slow and subtle - and totally believable. He will not give the Japanese the satisfaction ever of assuming they can control or intimidate the British; after all, there are rules in war and "gentlemen" play by the rules. Gentlemen also perform to the best of their abilities, no matter what the task - even if it means building a bridge for the enemy. But he's in this game too deeply and his insanity is a loss of reality.<br /><br />Everything works in this picture, with the biggest winner being British fortitude (though American practicality deserves a pat on the back, too). At first we are caught up in Guinness's seemingly noble actions, all that admirable British stiff upper lip behavior, and when the truth hits us, it's devastating. That's because David Lean's direction is perfect; he's like the poker player who knows he's got the winning Ace up his sleeve and timing is everything. The movies won a fistful of Oscars and deservedly so.</p></body></html>

If that is not enough we have new actors of great caliber and some new one liners to repeat to friends and family. Everything that made the original Indiana Jones films has been intensified.<br /><br />Karen Allen's character is just as cute and feisty as ever. It takes a couple of double takes to realize that Col. Dr. Irina Spalko is the Academy Award wining Cate Blanchett in a Natasha outfit. I could go on but it is time for you to see for your self.<br /><br />My favorite scene is where Indy is being showered down, hosed off and scrubbed. Watch closely as he is being scrubbed in a private part of his anatomy and has to make a broom adjustment.<br />--------------------------------------<br />It is the height of the Cold War. The Ruskies are looking for an upper hand. Naturally they look for the super natural or inter-dimensional physic advantage. And of course they get Dr. Hennery Jones Jr. (much older Harrison Ford) to unwittingly play into their hands. With the help of a young sidekick Mutt (Shia LaBeouf) he must find a crystal skull in an effort to free his kidnapped associate Henry Oxley (John Hurt). In the process he has to navigate between two independent women Col. Dr. Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) and Marion Ravenswood (Karen Allen.)<br /><br />Watch the movie to find out the mystery of the skull and if Indy, oops Hennery Jones Jr. will succeed or stick his fedora in it.  Bring your ant spray.<br /><br />I have to admit I waited for Blu-ray so I can not compare to non Blu-ray versions.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GTLR2A">The Lord of the Rings Trilogy (Theatrical and Extended Limited Edition) Cate Blanchett plays Galadriel </a></p></body></html>

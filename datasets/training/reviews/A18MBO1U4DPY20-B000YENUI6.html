Naomi Watts has proved herself in this particular role. She doesn't look as good as she acts and that's a compliment. The film had just the right amount of tenacity to hold the viewer's interest. There is an action scene in which a man fights like a warrior in the nude. This may not be as good as American Gangster but I can imagine Eastern Promises to win many awards this year. Better than History of Violence and more brutal, Eastern Promises is something you will take seriously. An absolutely vital recommendation for fans of crime/thriller drama genre. Newage Godfather that doesn't seem to try hard at all.</p></body></html>

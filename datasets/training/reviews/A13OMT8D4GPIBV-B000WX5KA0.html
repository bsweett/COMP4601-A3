<meta name="summary" content="A movie that needs to be EXPERIENCED more than just watched"></head><body><p>One of the best movies of all time.  There's a short list of movies one needs to experience more than just watch and this is one of them.  I'd throw <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXAA">The Godfather DVD Collection (The Godfather/ The Godfather - Part II/ The Godfather - Part III)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX9E">Citizen Kane</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783226055">Vertigo (Collector's Edition)</a> on that list.<br /><br />A really effective movie that gets you to contemplate your own surroundings.  Nothing is it at rest here and Scorsese and De Niro really bring this character to screen, especially De Niro.  You can't even consider him a "character" after watching De Niro's brilliant performance as Travis Bickle.<br /><br />The extras on this disc are amazing also.  Two commentaries and plenty of featurettes.  Finally, a fit version for this masterpiece of a movie.<br /><br />One of the best character studies of all time.  Highly recommend.</p></body></html>

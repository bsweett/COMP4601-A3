<meta name="summary" content="You'll laugh, wonder why you did then laugh some more"></head><body><p>The creators of South Park Trey Parker and Matt Stone made a film that is an odd theme to it: serious action and romance but it involves puppets with very visible strings. So of course it ends up becoming funny on that basis and on another basis due to the film itself. Some parts maybe aren't as funny but more often than that it hits its mark.<br /><br />There's Middle Eastern terrorists in Paris and Team America, a force assigned to protect America although maybe not officially comes to the rescue. Only they end up causing more damage than the terrorists do and they lose one of their members. It's believed that Kim Jong Il, North Korea's dictator is going to strike but they don't know where.<br /><br />So they hire Gary, a Broadway actor who's starring in Lease, a spoof of Rent(with its big closer "Everyone Has AIDS"). They hire him to infiltrate terrorist headquarters and find out their plans.<br /><br />As for the film's famous puppet sex scene, it's funny looking at it cause it looks funny but there's 2 sex shots that kind of ruins it and turns it from being funny to just weird and gross. It's funny that people got so riled up about it since the puppets don't even have "parts" besides the woman who's got breasts. It's more of the implied nature of the position/sex act which riles up people. Maybe you've done something they've done, who knows.<br /><br />The violence is slightly over the top, only cause you're looking at puppets. One puppet gets the top half of his head kicked off while panthers(they're actually real live cats) starts snacking on a puppet's neck and taking the head with it.<br /><br />One great aspect of the film is the songs. It's got characters singing them or just part of the soundtrack but you got the aforementioned "Everyone Has AIDS", the Team America theme "America(F*** Yeah!)" and Kim Jong Il's ballad "So Ronely". He doesn't really pronounce words clearly so that's actually lonely or when he says Arec Ballwin instead of Alec Baldwin.<br /><br />Like the title says, there's humor here that is so blatantly offensive you'd be shocked yet you'd laugh with everyone else and be like "hey wait a minute that's offensive! &lt;another funny scene, you laugh> why did I laugh at that again? Isn't it gross?"</p></body></html>

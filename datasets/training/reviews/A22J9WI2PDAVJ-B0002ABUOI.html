Director Zack Snyder utilizes the technology of today to enhance the movies realistic feel. Dawn achieves this realistic quality. In the past few years there have been a string of so called Zombie movies to hit the big screen. Resident Evil, 28 Days Later and Cabin Fever feature the undead.  Zombie movies are popular today because of the video games that feature them. The players can kill the Zombies just like the movies.<br /><br />  Dawn of the Dead (2004) Unrated Director's cut is gory and realistic. Every detail is carefully explored to give a realistic feel if the undead were to conquer the planet today. This movie is scary in the fact of, if this scenario came true, but not scary in deliberately trying to pop zombies out of hidden camera angles that will make you jump out of your seat. (Okay some pop outs!) This movie is more of in your face reality. The pregnancy and baby born scene do nothing to help the movie move along and it should have been just left out.<br /><br />  If you want to see realistic images of killing Zombies and gory blood sucking scenes, then this movie is for you. The unrated DVD should not be seen by children under seventeen; hence the rating. The plot and ended do nothing for this movie but take a back seat to the realistic action/bloody scenes.<br /><br />  I have one question for the Zack Snyder; why Milwaukee? What did we ever do to desire such a horrific setting!<br /><br />  The majority of the bonus features can be skipped. The only ones worth watching are the behind the scenes filming of the makeup/special effects and the deleted scenes with commentary by Zack.<br />  Add this to your DVD collection if you are a realistic Zombie.</p></body></html>

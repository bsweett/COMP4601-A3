Tony Curtis & Jack Lemmon star as Joe & Jerry, two Chicago musicians in the 1920's Prohibition era, who on down on their luck. They accept a job playing for mobster Spats Colombo (George Raft) at his funeral parlor which is a front for a speakeasy.  The police raid the club and shut it down and they again out of work.  They go to a musical booking agency where they learn of a dream job down in Florida, with all transportation and expenses paid, with a band who need a saxophone and bass player (which happens to be the guy's instruments).  The offer is a set up from the secretary, who Joe stood up for a date, as the catch is that it's an all female band.  Joe tries to convince Jerry to take it by dressing up as woman, but he refuses and they accept another job in Urbana.  While on their way there, they stop for gas when they inadvertently witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.  They are spotted as witnesses and are set to be rubbed out when they try to get the all girl gig and are surprised when they get it.  When then see to two in full drag wobbling on heels to the train with the new names of Josephine & Daphne.  It is on the train where the real humor of the film comes through.  They met the lead singer of the band Sugar Kane Kowalczyk played by a never sexier Marilyn Monroe.  Each of them try to gain her favor, but Jerry ends up being hit on by a lecherous Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown) who is completely taken with Daphne.  The interplay between Mr. Lemmon & Mr. Brown is filled with perfect comedic timing and is a seminar in farcical comedy.  During their time in Florida, Joe tries to win Sugar's heart by meeting her out of drag character and pretends to be a millionaire.  All the while Spats has come to Florida and he finds the two musicians and wants to rub them out finally.  In the end, Joe, Jerry & Sugar escape on Osgood's yacht where he proposes to Daphne.  Daphne makes up a bunch of different reasons why they can't marry to which Osgood replies he doesn't care.  Finally Daphne rips off his wig and I declares "I'm a man" to which Osgood delivers one of the best closing lines in film history, "well, nobody's perfect".  The film was nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Actor (Mr. Lemmon), Best Director and Best Screenplay, but only took home one award for Costume design.  The film was recently voted the number one comedy of all-time by the American Film Institute.</p></body></html>

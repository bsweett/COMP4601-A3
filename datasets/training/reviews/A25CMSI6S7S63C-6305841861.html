<meta name="summary" content="Evil Dead 2 is another great Zombie movie - bloody , scary & funny"></head><body><p>This is a very entertaining zombie movie. Horror,scares that are blended with great funny moments make for one great movies. Bruce Campbell stars as Ash - his status become legendary after this, now he is a major horror icon and always gets roles in TV shows, and appears in Spiderman movies since his buddy Sam Raimi is the director. Sort of a remake of the first Evil Dead...the dead come to life after reading passages to the Necronomicon. The effects,action,horror and suspense are just all stupendous and the gore was really aplenty in this movie. You will laugh, scream & just have a great time watching this.A good scene to watch for is Ash (Campbell) fighting his own hand and watch out for flying eyeball (GULP)<br />I know there have been plenty of releases on DVD of it as usual with Anchor Bay milking it for all its worth. I have the tin of it and I am keeping it - no matter how many re-releases. I like the tin and I am happy with all the bonus features included (commentaries,etc). In most cases all the re-releases have the same features anyway.<br />Great film and worth owning no matter what release you choose.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The most heartbreaking of horror films"></head><body><p>I was like her once.... Maybe that's why this movie is so heartbreaking for me to watch. Its whole buildup to the inevitable climax at the Bates High School prom is so expertly constructed out of plot devices, stellar character development, and amazing visual style that we are helplessly swept out to sea by the undertow of our love for the title character. Carrie White (flawless Sissy Spacek) is so wonderfully innocent and remarkably performed that we have no choice in the matter. We are like her prom date at first: Sort of iffy, but then we can't help but adore her. And we can't help but empathize with her because of this grotesque life that she is forced to lead by her pamphlet-pushing religious radical of a mother (the outstanding Piper Laurie). The scenes between the mother and daughter in this film are the key to its satirical elements, as well as giving us a crucial understanding of Carrie's mind. We know why she's so shy, so emotionally distraught, because we would be too in her situation. The very first scene between Spacek and Laurie is a virtuoso, not so much of acting as being the characters, embodying them so fully that all traces of the actresses disappear. They are the key to the entire film; that and Brian Depalma's incredible visuals, which inject every last bit of fear into our veins. Depalma comments on one of the DVD documentaries that he had more time to toy with the visuals in "Carrie" than in any other movie he made. It shows. His POV and incredibly detailed crane shots are why certain scenes work at all. By seeing what these characters see, it becomes easier to understand why they act the way they do. Some people might criticize for the excessive use of slow motion, calling it overkill, but it does volumes for the buildup to the climax, which is so powerful with its harsh, constant musical undertone that I dare call it one of the best, most disquieting scenes ever filmed.<p>The film begins with Carrie in the far corner of the screen, awaiting a volleyball toss that she will miss, provoking insults from the girls in her gym class. Then we are shown the locker room in what would have been an exploitation shot if not for the fact that the music and slow motion camerawork make it seem so beautiful. But we are also put on our guard because of this shot, which shows full frontal nudity; frowned upon in most corners of cinema. However it makes one thing clear: This is a director who will do anything. All the "Halloween" cliches are not to be found here. There are no cheap shocks. Everything is crafted with only the purpose of building tension, from the blood cascading down Carrie's leg in the shower to one of the single best crane shots I've ever seen, where our fears are allowed to build and build to the breaking point, only to have them build some more before the final purge. The parallel stories of a revenge plot and Carrie's being asked to the prom by the most popular guy in school take the film along at the exact pace it needs, and the intercut scenes with Carrie and her mother supply the emotional center for the film, which rests with our love for Carrie: A character so sweet and unassuming that the slow motion approach to the stage brings a smile to our faces too, even though we are terrified of what awaits her. Therein lies the power of the film. The more we love Carrie, the more we hate her antagonists and feel hurt that they would be so cruel.<p>"Carrie" is quite possibly the single most dramatically sound horror film ever made. It maps out its characters so vividly and realistically that we never question anyone's actions. There's none of those traditional "She's so stupid!" remarks you hear in so many a horror film audience. "Carrie" is the real deal. A film that builds an entire house made out of brittle cards of terror, stacking it up until it falls and our fears are realized. There are no scenes of ridiculous scares or people jumping out of the closets to scare their buddies. Depalma recognizes these kind of devices for what they are: Useless. His film is a superb example of how many ways a story can go right, and it is a masterpiece that I am proud to place very high on my list of favorite films.</p></body></html>

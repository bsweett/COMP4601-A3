<meta name="summary" content="Exquisite Crime Thriller with Explosive Leading Performances"></head><body><p>Beautifully shot and directed, this tour de force features stellar performances by both Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx (should have gotten a "Best Actor" nom...there's nothing "supporting" about his role...it's 50/50 with Cruise, who also does some of his best work to date).<br /><br />Novel concept, smartly adapted and interpreted.  Fantastic supporting cast led by Pinkett Smith and Ruffalo.  So much care and attention went into the detail of this film that it is a pleasure to watch and gripping from beginning to end.<br /><br />The DVD contains many interesting special features, particularly rehearsal footage and Director's Commentary.  Kudoes to Cruise, Foxx, Mann and Beattie on a wonderful work.</p></body></html>

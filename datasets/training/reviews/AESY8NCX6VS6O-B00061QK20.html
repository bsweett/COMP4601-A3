<meta name="summary" content="An absolutely pointless, boring, schmaltzy foreign film"></head><body><p>There is a scene deep into Yimou Zhang's Hero that burns with inspiration. A warrior bent on assassinating the king of the kingdom of Qin, Broken Sword, enters the chambers of His Majesty and begins a violent assault for which the king is well-equipped. The two men battle with a ferocious intensity, unencumbered by excessive slow-motion or flying effects, while huge tapestries of lime green plunge to the ground like majestic birds shot to their deaths. The scene has suspense, it has intensity, it has life...and unfortunately, that's the only time you'll find those things in the 96-but-feels-like-200 minutes of Hero.<br /><br />  Which is kind of shocking, considering the movie starts out with such a promising fanfare. Against a slowly forming background, we learn of the history of China 2000 years ago: how it was divided into kingdoms, how they all fought with each other, and how one king attempted to bring it all to a close. Unfortunately, being a king and all, a lot of people want his ass dead, so the poor dude can't get any sleep. Finally, though, a nameless warrior ends His Majesty's worries by wiping out the three deadliest assassins and the king wants to hear his story. Nameless (Jet Li) proceeds, guided by a rather nice panoramic shot, to the chamber of the king and rests 100 paces from him, with the promise to advance paces at the king's behest. So he begins his story, and the framing device of the film is set up. If Hero had remained in that room with Nameless and the king, it would work. There is a message about honor, about duty, and about patriotism that arises from the film's present-tense frame that I found intriguing in parts. Of course, it would only last about 15 minutes if it did that, but as of now, I'd take that over the pure, shameless tripe that gets slung during the flashbacks.<br /><br />  Hero is a perfect case of simply trying too hard. The first flashback of Nameless' murder of the first assassin, Sky, culminates in a dull battle overstuffed with relentless slow-mo, Matrix-esque bullet-time effects, and - but of course - Crouching Tiger flying. I don't have anything against martial arts; I think it's a compelling art that has created some enjoyable cinema. Director Zhang, though, doesn't seem to think that the existence of the violence itself is enough, though, and he insists on hampering it with special-effects flourishes, one after the other. It's tiring, uninspired, and - worse yet - kinda boring.<br /><br />  The film moves on to the next stage of Nameless' quest, in which he must get rid of the last two assassins, lovers Broken Sword and Flying Snow. Slowly but surely, Hero reveals itself as what it truly is: an ultra-expensive movie that disguises its vapidity in a frame story with echoes of themes done 100 times before, and 100 times better in other movies. One of the more unnerving aspects of the film is its presentation of metaphors. Instead of subtle gestures that even a semi-stupid audience would get, things like "music is like sword-fighting," and "calligraphy is like sword-fighting" are written into the script and said multiple times! Even the visual beauty of the film gets old: cinematographer Christopher Doyle (who so brilliantly photographed Phillip Noyce's Quiet American and Rabbit-Proof Fence) drenches the set pieces in a single color scheme for really no other point than to look pretty.<br /><br />  And I'm sorry, call me old-fashioned, but this crap just comes across as silly. I'm not a huge fan of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon but I don't really remember unintentionally laughing at some of the flying scenes. Ang Lee's film created that visual as a kind of extension of the characters' abilities: the characters of Tiger seemed so skilled that it just seemed logical that they could defy gravity. Hero just seems like it had extra money and some strings hanging around.<br /><br />  There is a decent message (trite as it may be) hidden deep within the film, and when the plot opens wider into a Rashomon-like angle, Hero has brief moments of narrative intelligence. In fact, a scene following many of the flashbacks, in which an important revelation about the king's fate is made, is flat-out well-done. It's all lost, though, in the endless, pointless exercise of style that consumes the bulk of the film. Hero is far from heroic; it borrows from so many other movies, I'd go as far as to call it a wimp. C-</p></body></html>

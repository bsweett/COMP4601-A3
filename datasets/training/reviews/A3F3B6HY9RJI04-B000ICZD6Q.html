<meta name="summary" content="Excellent Acting and Entertaining"></head><body><p>I like a good drama with some comedy and that seems quite true to life and comes with excellent acting.  This movie nails that expectation right on the head.<br /><br />This is the story of Dave Foreman (Dennis Quaid) who is the manager of the sales team at the number one sports magazine in the nation.  When the magazine gets sold, David is replaced by a young hot-shot who is half his age named Carter Duryea (Topher Grace).  But wait, there is more!!!<br /><br />But I would recommend catching movie and following the story on your own.  All I can promise is that the story is fantastic and totally keeps you involved.<br /><br />The best part of this movie is the acting.  Every character is done perfectly.  I could not expect a better performance by anybody in this movie.  I have only known Topher Grace from the few episodes I've seen of "That 70's Show".  I was totally impressed and could not believe that it was him I was watching.  You see his highs (like finding out he is being courted or picking out his brand new car) and his lows (as he gets divorced, gets dumped, gets punched in the face, has to fire people twice his age, and wrecks said sports car).  I expect great things to come from him in the future.<br /><br />Dennis Quaid is fantastic as always. He also carried a wide emotional range as he faces being replaced by a young kid, finding out his wife is pregnant, dealing with issues with his daughters, and having to fire two of his friends.<br /><br />Also what makes this movie great is that it doesn't have a completely happy ending.  You see the potential in the future of everybody's lives involved, but that is left to your imagination.  And that makes this movie, to me, real.  Life is like that.  Heck, who does live happily ever after with no more problems in life?  My wife was a bit disappointed by the ending, I loved it!<br /><br />If you like movies described as I did in the first paragraph, check this movie out.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.</p></body></html>

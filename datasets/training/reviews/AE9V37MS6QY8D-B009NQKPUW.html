<meta name="summary" content="Great sci-fi and essential viewing for any "Alien" fan!"></head><body><p>For those of you wondering ... yes, this is a prequel to the 1979 sci-fi hit <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00011V8IQ">Alien (The Director's Cut)</a>. However, it is notsomuch the origin of the Alien (even though that is included), but it is more of the origin story of the Weyland Corporation (from the Weyland-Yutani Corporation of the original "Alien" movie franchise) and his true obsessive reasoning for space exploration. The overall story structure of the film follows closely to the original "Alien" in regard to the fact that it starts out slow and appearing as some mere space exploration film, but then all hell breaks loose! Not much happens in the exact story, but the overall legend that this story adds to the Alien universe is essential! Plus, "Prometheus" has a scene involving a high-tech operation table where my jaw literally dropped; I couldn't believe that writers Lindelof (of TV's "Lost") and Spaihts went there! And just when you think, "What's gonna happen now?", the film answers your question but with one minor caveat (the ending is still somewhat open), and ultimately ends on a great note that will give film geeks that orgasmic feeling. Performances are wonderful, effects are even better and the alien design is exquisite! Kudos, Mr. Scott! Kudos.</p></body></html>

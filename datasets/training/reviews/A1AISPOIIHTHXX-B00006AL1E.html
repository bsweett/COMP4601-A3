<meta name="summary" content="3 classics, one package"></head><body><p>Despite being slightly dated, a lot of the films from the 1980's, such as "E.T", "Gremlins", "the Princess Bride", as well as Robert Zemeckis' "Back to the Future" trilogy, manage to be good films in their own right and yet hold a special place because of how often they were watched or how influencing they were to our childhood. While one is the most well-known and best of the 3, each of the films in the trilogy has their own strengths that create a satisfying whole. Combined into one set, you can watch the gigantic time-travelling story and not only have fun in doing so but remembering how strong they were to us growing up.<br /><br />The first film finds Marty McFly, an aspiring musician in 1985, friends with eccentric/brilliant scientist Dr. Emmett "Doc" Brown, who has just invented something extraordinary: a time-travelling car built out of a DeLorean. But trouble happens and Marty is transported to 1955 and interferes with his mother meeting his father. Not only stuck but having to somehow get his parents together, Marty finds out more about his parents and with the help of Doc, has to get Marty back home.<br /><br />The second film has Marty, along with Doc and Marty's girlfriend Jennifer having to travel to 2015 to correct a familial problem. However, upon returning to 1985, things are incredibly worse and they find out that old Biff Tannen, the bully from the first film, went back in time and allowed his younger self to become rich and powerful. Now Marty and Doc have to correct the timeline while trying to avoid interfering with the actions of their "other" selves.<br /><br />The third film has Doc accidentally sent back to 1885 and Marty stranded in 1955. But he founds out Doc ends up getting killed a week after writing a letter to Marty so rather then go home, Marty travels to the Old West to rescue his old friend. However with technology being vastly underdeveloped as well as a possible love interest for Doc and Biff's ancestor wrecking havoc, Marty has to finally get back to his own time and hope Doc wants to come with him.<br /><br />Unlike let's say Pirates of the Caribbean or the Matrix trilogies which felt more like a stand-alone followed by a gigantic film cut in 2, the films in Back to the Future have more of a continuing story but each film feels distinctive unto itself to warrant any watching of any sequel at any time since they're so familiar. But they are separated by cliffhangers and it helps to watch them all to get a feel for the films as a whole. On that note, the first is an undisputed classic that never seems to age despite some relative obviousness of special effects. It's the sequels that become the interesting one since I liked the ingenuity of the second but found it a bit darker, less funny while the third had a good concept and tonally was similar to the first but just not a good story overall. But the films are so enjoyable that it doesn't really matter in the end so it's all fun anyway.<br /><br />Each film contains some good featurettes like a making-of made at the time, a retrospective, a scene-specific (though kind of dull) commentary, a Q&A commentary track where Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale answer questions from audience members, deleted scenes, a Michael J. Fox subtitle track a la Matrix's "White Rabbit" and a trivia track similar to the Abyss. The special features are welcome, unfortunately they just feel slight and don't seem as in-depth as you'd like for such classic films.<br /><br />I'd very much recommend the set for those who loved the films as well as the maybe 3 of you who have never seen it and can enjoy it whenever you want.</p></body></html>

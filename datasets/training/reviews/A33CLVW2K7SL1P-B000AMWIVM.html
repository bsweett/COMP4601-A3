FINALLY, my faith in American suspense has been restored. Never have I said this, but not since The Silence of the Lambs (the undisputed king of this genre) has a movie affected me as strongly - although the aforementioned film is still leaps and bounds ahead of Saw.<br /><br />Comments about poor acting have been made. I don't necessarily agree. My question would be: what were people expecting from Elwes? He's not exactly Oscar material, though I've enjoyed his performances in several films. As far as the rest of the acting, it was extravagantly believable. There wasn't a second during this movie that I wasn't entirely, fully engaged: and that simply can not be accomplished without good acting. Story and plot only take you so far.<br /><br />This movie achieved something that very few do. Examples of what I'm about to mention would be David Mamet's House of Games and The Spanish Prisoner. All three of these films lead you to believe that you know exactly what's going on, and that empowers the viewer - you think you know something that the characters on the screen do not. However, you find, even when warned that you are going to be tricked, that you *still* fall for it. You are entirely controlled by the film.<br /><br />The settings are immaculate, and the camera angles and lighting serve to bring the viewer into the movie. This is easily one of the best films of the year. Yes, horror/suspense can be considered "one of the best" - remember, the aforementioned The Silence of the Lambs won the "Big Five" Oscars: Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Picture. Granted, I don't think that Saw will win any of these because it was a tad too formulaic (with a few Scream-like scenes in it), and it lacked the one thing that Silence had: Anthony Hopkins. Still, it was an amazing film.</p></body></html>

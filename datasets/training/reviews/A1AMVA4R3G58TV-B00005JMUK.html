<meta name="summary" content="Great Performances but a Shocking Movie"></head><body><p>I went to see "Monster" because there is so much talk of Charlize getting the Oscar this year. And yes, her performance does deserve it. She is totally convincing as this mass-murderer.<br />I also thought Christina Ricci deserved an award nomination as well for her role as the shy naive girlfriend.<br />However, I left the movie theatre feeling like I needed a shower.  The violence is pretty shocking and stomach-turning. I know this is a true story, but I wish the film makers would have taken a slightly different route to telling the story. Maybe they felt they needed to show the murder scenes as realistically as possible to show exactly what happened.<br />It is sad to think what happened to Ailleen could happen to any person - her life was such a horrible disaster. Charlize portrays this perfectly, and I hope she gets the Oscar for it.</p></body></html>

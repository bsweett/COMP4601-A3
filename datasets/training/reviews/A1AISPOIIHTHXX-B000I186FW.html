<meta name="summary" content="It's good in that kind of "it didn't waste my time" way"></head><body><p>After anticipating this movie for so long, all of a sudden I found myself not wanting to watch it. I couldn't figure it out: was it the negative press, or the controversy, or the fact that I read the original graphic novel and wasn't that big of a fan of it? I still can't figure it out after watching it actually. It's certainly an admirable film and one that's really easy to like but I found it hard to love.<br /><br />We're in an Orwellian "1984"-esque England where the government controls everything, microphones and cameras are everywhere, religious texts are banned and dissenters often disappear. Leading the fight for freedom is V, a man in a mask inspired by Guy Fawkes who dons knives and takes down key members of government and plans to blow up Parliament. With him is Evey, a young woman whose had more than her share of problems who can't figure out whether action does create results, even if said action involves killing and explosions.<br /><br />Remember how after 9/11, certain songs or movies were kind of banned for awhile? Then there was that Simpsons episode where Homer goes to the Towers looking for a washroom that got taken off the air? Well Vendetta certainly picked a worst(or better, depending on your viewpoint) time to come out since anything involving terrorism gets people up in arms. I find governments have the ability to go deaf at will, oblivious to people's cries for help until they decide action should be taken. Standing in front of a tree once a year and saying the environment is good does not make you an environmentalist. Well, blowing up Parliament or the White House certainly isn't a good idea to create change, it's sad that something of that magnitude in some form has to happen before people realize "hey, we ARE getting screwed here!"<br /><br />How is the film? Well, it's got problems really. It starts out fine but then it hits the hour mark and while it doesn't slam on the brakes, the gas is definately running out. I'm not an action junkie but I'd like something of substance to happen and unfortunately it just kind of goes. Acting-wise though the film is quite good with Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving, the latter being very charismatic even just through voice. But like in Lord of the Rings, I can't help but think he's gonna bust out a "Mr. Anderson..." at any moment.<br /><br />Extras-wise it's incredibly disappointing. There was more featurettes on my one disc Serenity then there was on this thing. Expect another release sometime in the future I bet. The film works at the same time for reasons it doesn't but despite the fact the Wachowski Brothers are all over this, it certainly makes up for the last 2 Matrix movies.</p></body></html>

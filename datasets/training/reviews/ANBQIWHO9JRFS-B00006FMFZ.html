The plot of 'Road to Perdition' is not especially remarkable.  It involves well-worn themes from Mafia films like honor, revenge, family and the desire to get away from this violent world, and the characters are nothing particularly new either.  (Tom Hanks is the cold, workmanlike killer, Daniel Craig the crazy wild card protected by his position as the son of Paul Newman, who is the surprisingly warm and kind mafia boss who is, nevertheless, utterly ruthless at heart etc.)  There's certainly nothing wrong with this plot, and it has some fine lines and a few particularly affecting scenes, but it's nothing to get to overly worked up over.  Still, the sheer craft displayed herein makes the film remarkable.  The performances are all perfect, the score, while perhaps overly conventional, is powerful and emotive, the cinematography is consistently stunning and the period detail is utterly convincing.  Again, this is a world we've seen before, but it's more fully realized then ever before, and it makes the film nearly mesmerizing even in the scenes where little is actually going on.  Also, there's one scene late in the film, a firefight in the streets during fierce storm, which is simply breath taking.  It's definitely one of the most powerful examples of pure cinema I've seen in a long time.<br /><br /> Yeah, that's it.  Just a stunningly well made film.<br /><br />Grade: A-</p></body></html>

Neither choppers nor fighter planes can take him out. As usual, his adversaries are some kind of German-Russian terrorists. Naturally, a stereotyped nerdie hacker is part of the show, too.<br /><br />The top bandits lack personality, however. No scarred faces, no foreign accents, very little sociopathology, etc. The Asiatic woman looks like a stale computer animation. A hacker job, perhaps?<br /><br />This is a fan movie. If you actually liked "Die Hard", where Bruce was running around half-naked in a skyscraper for most of the time, or "Die Hard 2", with that fabulous plane crash, or "Die Hard and Zeus meets Simon Says" when you were 14 years old, you will *love* this one.<br /><br />If not, you will just say what me and my father said when we watched it the other day on Swedish cabel: "Now, this is a *very* unrealistic movie, don't you think?".<br /><br />:D<br /><br />Where's that fire sale, by the way?</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A movie that rises below stupidity - hilarious!"></head><body><p>Will Ferrell's latest comedic effort, "Talladega Nights:  The Ballad of Ricky Bobby" calls to mind one of my favorite Mel Brooks quotes.  A person who had seen one of Mr. Brooks' early comedies accused him of making a "vulgar" film.  Mr. Brooks' response was something along the lines of, "Madame, my film rises below vulgarity."<br /><br />That kind of ridiculous-yet-sublime humor motivates the best of Will Ferrell's comic efforts, whether it be "More cowbell!" on Saturday Night Live or "Stay sexy, San Diego," in "Anchorman."  There is plenty of "stupid wit" on exhibition in "Talladega Nights," and it is executed nearly flawlessly.  This is an improvement over Ferrell's previous project with director Adam McKay, the occasionally-hilarious "Anchorman."<br /><br />The titular Ricky Bobby was born in an American muscle car going over 100 mph as dear old dad (Gary Cole) was having too good a time driving fast to bother to stop at the hospital.  Dad was the biggest formative influence on Ricky, showing up to Ricky's school stoned and saying, "If you're not first, you're last."  That becomes Ricky's guiding philosophy as he joins the NASCAR circuit, along with his friend Cal (John C. Reilly, in a performance that brings to mind Jeff Daniels' wonderful job in "Dumb and Dumber").  Together, they form "Shake n Bake," where Cal always helps Ricky win and together they put product placements on everything in sight . . . including saying grace.<br /><br />That's all I'll do as far as recapping the plot, but it is a comic plot full of rich, intelligent-stupid humor.  To say that NASCAR is ripe for the comic picking is an understatement, and Ferrell's team nails it without ever getting condescending.  Sure, there are plenty of jokes poked at NASCAR fans, but it's the same kind of humor you find in "My Name is Earl" on TV - these guys may be losers, but they have a certain dignity to them.  And speaking of "Earl," if you like Jaime Pressly in the role of Joy, you are going to love Leslie Bibb's performance as Carley Bobby, Ricky's NASCAR-flamboyant (and opportunistic) wife.<br /><br />Look for several laugh-out-loud moments in "TN," but surprisingly little profanity and no nudity.  I'm reviewing the "Unrated" edition, and other than a couple of f-bombs that apparently weren't in the theatrical version, there is nothing here that obviously warrants a "Do Not Let the Kiddies See This Version" alert.  Also, sit through the out-takes over the closing credits for some hilarious moments involving Ferrell, Reilly, Michael Clarke Duncan, and others riffing unsuccessfully during various scenes.<br /><br />Here's to you, Ricky Bobby - you're surely #1 on the NASCAR charts.</p></body></html>

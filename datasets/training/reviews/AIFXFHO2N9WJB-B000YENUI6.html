I figured it was probably some romantic drama that wouldn't hold all that much interest for me. Later on, I saw a preview for the movie, and was surprised to discover that the movie dealt with the Russian mob, featured two very talented people in the lead roles, Viggo Mortensen (`The Lord of the Rings' trilogy) and Naomi Watts ("The Ring" and "The Ring 2"), and boasted a critically acclaimed director at the helm with David Cronenberg ("A History of Violence"). After discovering all of this, I must say that my interest was indeed heightened; however, when the movie was released it spent so little time at my local cinema that I never had a chance to go see it. So, I was left waiting for the eventual DVD release, but was the movie worth the wait after all?<br /><br />"Eastern Promises" is the story of how one action, no matter how benevolent it may be, can be enough to bring your entire world crashing down around you. Anna (Naomi Watts) was living a peaceful existence as a nurse when one night a pregnant teenager is admitted to her hospital, and gives birth, but dies shortly after. With this Anna begins her search to discover if the teen had any surviving relatives that would be willing to care for the newborn child; however, the deeper Anna gets into her search the more frightening the discoveries she makes about this young girl become. During her search Anna comes across the name of a local restaurant owner, but this is far from any ordinary restaurant, as it is merely a front for a Russian mafia family. As she tries to discover the teen's connection to the restaurant, Anna receives a warning from the driver/assassin for the family, Nikolai (Viggo Mortensen), to basically stay away if she wants to live. Now, Anna must try to do what's right for the newborn, protect her family, try to keep her world from crumbling around her, all while seeking justice for the wrongs that had been committed against the teenage mother at the hands of the mob.<br /><br />As I stated earlier, I really wanted to see this movie after I found out what it was about. I figured the two lead characters were being handled by two very capable Hollywood talents, and the director had impressed me with his previous effort "A History of Violence", so I thought that this movie had a decent chance of being very good. After viewing it, I was somewhat mixed on my opinion of the overall film.<br /><br />The actors were all very good in each of their individual roles within the film. Viggo Mortensen is definitely worthy of any awards he may receive for his role as the driver/up-and-coming assassin for the family. His character Nikolai was incredibly brutal at times, seeming to contain no shred of remorse one minute, then the next he would seem to have a genuine compassion for Anna and her family in his desire to protect her from the evil of his `family'. Naomi Watts was solid as Anna, a nurse who by only trying to do what is right puts all that she knows in jeopardy. The rest of the cast is comprised of various European actors, most of whom I had no recollection of seeing in any other films prior, but each were great in their various roles. Well, I take that back, I had seen Vincent Cassell in a film or two, the most recent was his villainous turn in the thriller "Derailed" co-starring Jennifer Aniston and Clive Owen, and I believe he was much better in this film than the latter, due to his character being much more conflicted and not just a complete bad guy. His character was vicious when he had to be, yet also was so weak in front of his father that you almost felt sorry for him at times.<br /><br />The story was good, though moved a little slowly at times. It was very brutal and bloody, shockingly so in some places (primarily the shower fight scene), but then other scenes were perfectly tense with great dialogue to move the story along, and then there would be these seemingly unnecessary scenes that just seemed to drag the movie down. There just didn't seem to be a good balance for the film, perhaps if some of the slow scenes had been trimmed up or removed completely the film would have been better.<br /><br />The direction from David Cronenberg was strong, and he was a suitable fit for the film's gritty, ultra-violent subject matter and the consequences entailed, as he had shown with his previous thriller "A History of Violence". Sometimes I wonder if Cronenberg is merely trying to shock the audience or make them somewhat uncomfortable with what he puts on the screen. His last film featured very violent sequences that were incredibly realistic and hard-hitting yet not disturbing, but "Eastern Promises" seemed to go even further with the brutality, especially the shower sequence. That scene in particular was necessary to the story, but could have taken place in some other location. The shower location was probably chosen in an attempt to shock the entire audience with the graphic violence and nudity contained all in one scene. I just have to question whether Cronenberg is including these sequences to better the story or to satisfy a thirst for being as unconventional and shocking as he can be with his movies.<br /><br />Overall, "Eastern Promises" is an alright movie, it's nothing great but not horrible either. The movie boasts some very impressive performances from each of its actors, and some of the hardest hitting fight scenes I had seen in quite some time, but some very slow periods throughout the film coupled with an overall dreary tone kept this film from being anything worth watching a second time.<br /><br />"Eastern Promises" is rated R for violence, language, and nudity.</p></body></html>

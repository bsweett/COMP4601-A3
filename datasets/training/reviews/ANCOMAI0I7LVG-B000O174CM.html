<meta name="summary" content="It's light on substance but heavy on entertainment..."></head><body><p>While the Oscar snub was certainly shocking I can't say that it wasn't justified (not that the lineup for 2006 impressed me in the least).  `Dreamgirls', while probably one of the most entertaining films of the year, was far from the best.<br /><br />It delivers in many ways.  It's visually stunning, from the set pieces to the beautiful cast.  It's very easy on the ears.  The musical numbers (for the most part) are all brilliantly structured and add layers to the film.  In fact, the films biggest and key emotional scenes are in fact musical numbers.  Both `And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going' and `Listen' are the most emotionally connected scenes in the film for through music they convey the very feelings of the singer.  It also delivers, to an extent, in the acting department as well.  Eddie Murphy is fantastic as James "Thunder" Early and delivers a career best performance.  Beyonce Knowles shocked me with her delivery of Deena Jones and Anika Noni Rose beautifully captured the immaturity and naivety of Lorrel Robinson.  In fact everyone delivers decently here except for Jamie Foxx who was, without a doubt, miscast.<br /><br />Sadly, with all this delivery the film fails to deliver in the one area that matters the most; substance.  By the time the credits begin to roll `Dreamgirls' is nothing more than a fun time.  The characters, while superbly acted, lack any real depth and the film fails to evoke any real emotion in the audience.  With all the hype surrounding this film you'd expect to be really moved, really taken-a-back by it's magnitude but in the end it doesn't really do any of that.  One may be blinded by the glitz and glam upon a first viewing, as I was, but upon second and third viewings it becomes apparent that the film feels kind of empty, especially when the music has stopped.<br /><br />The film tells the story of aspiring musical act `The Dreamettes' who finally get their big break after aspiring music manager Curtis Taylor Jr. sees them perform in a talent show.  He persuades them to sing backup for R&B sensation James "Thunder" Early and thus their showbiz life begins.  The group suffers from internal struggles when lead singer Effie is pushed aside so the slimmer, more socially termed `pretty girl' Deena can sing lead vocals.  This seemingly small gesture drives a wedge in friendships and relationships, working and social, and creates a whirlwind of tragedy and in the end justice.<br /><br />Now, I left off one key element to the film for a reason...and that is the fact that arguably there was no bigger star in 2006 than the beautiful and talented Jennifer Hudson.  I don't necessarily agree with her Oscar win, but I was so happy for her because she delivered on all fronts and was so gracious with all the accolades she was receiving.  She handled herself like a true star, and that is commendable.  As Effie White she truly breathed life into this film and serves as one of the only actors here to actually flesh out her character.  With all the `lack of depth' found in `Dreamgirls' it is refreshing to see Jennifer grab a hold of Effie and make her real and relatable to the audience.  So I am here to tell you that Jennifer ain't goin nowhere, and that is a fact!<br /><br />So, the film is, like I said, extremely entertaining and a truly fun filled time.  Parts are corny (that whole "Steppin' to the Bad Side" part was dreadfully painful to watch) but as a whole it is just good ol' fun.  But that is it.  It is a fun film, but not a deep one and not one that deserved to win Oscars (aside from some technical, musical and acting recognition).  So, do I feel that the Oscar snub was truly a `snub'?  No, but I don't feel that that really takes away from the appeal and the good time that a film like `Dreamgirls' brings to the table.</p></body></html>

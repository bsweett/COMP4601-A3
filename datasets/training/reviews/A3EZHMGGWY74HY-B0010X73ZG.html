I am not a big Stephen King fan, but I am always impressed by his ability to show us the monster within us, that being much more dastardly and devious and dangerous than any other creature that might pop out from under our bed.<br /><br />This movie started out much like any other Stephen King movie, a group of people are trapped by unseen forces (in MAINE!), they break into factions quickly, those that believe quick action is best, those that think waiting it out is best, those that aren't thinking much at all, just shaking in fear in the corner praying.  Soon they discover a bit of what they are facing, but as time goes on, fear takes over and it becomes apparent that it is much more dangerous to remain inside with the others than to risk your life to the unseen monsters outside.  That sure says a lot about us as a society.<br /><br />This movie made me wonder how I would handle myself in a similar situation, because other than the giant flying bugs and creatures with fangs, this sort of crisis could happen at any time. Natural disasters happen and so can being trapped with others, and as people get hungrier, more desperate, they might do anything, and things can always turn into a sort of modern day witch hunt, as we look to blame and seek solutions in unlikely ways.  I love a movie that makes me think, even if it's disturbing!<br /><br />All in all, I really liked this film.  I liked that it made me think.  I didn't like what it says about us as humans, but, hey...the truth hurts!  It was disturbing, made me cry, and I probably won't be watching it again.  Do I think it's worth seeing...YES!  Give it a try.  It's worth one night of uneasiness.</p></body></html>

Sadly, although there is a great deal to like about it, it's so solemn, pretentious, and impersonal that it fails to emotionally involve the audience with its characters. That said, if you love exciting, epic battle scenes, or summer blockbuster films, or even just seeing an unfairly handsome and buffed Brad Pitt, all sweaty and virtually nude, then read on . . .<br /><br />Film is a visual medium, and the original story is very, very long, so I can accept that many changes needed to be made. But in a bizarre move, all of the mythology of the original legend has been removed, and the story is rather presented as a historical epic, and not a mythological tale. I feel this was a great loss. I understand Director Wolfgang Petersen saw the gods as "silly and unnecessary to the plot". But when you consider the popularity of shows like Xena, I think audiences would be more accepting of mythology than Petersen gives them credit for.<br /><br />However, for me, the biggest problem with Troy is David Benioff's overly simplified screenplay: He manages to reduce a ten-year war to what appears to feel like just a week or so, he reduces Paris and Helen's romance to dopey teenage "I love yous", and a lot of the dialogue is empty rhetoric, with Achilles barking empty catch-phrases such as "Immortality! Take it! It's yours!". Indeed, the film is so solemn, pretentious, and impersonal that it fails to emotionally involve the audience with the characters. I recall seeing this film at the cinema and not really caring if any of the characters were killed. It's a pity that some of that $US200 million spent on the film couldn't have been spent on a script-doctor.<br /><br />The quality of Petersen's direction also varies. On one hand, he brings epic and complex action scenes with awesome set pieces to life with great precision. On the other hand, almost everything in Troy looks and feels fake. Many of the amazing sets and costumes, look like . . . well . . . amazing sets and costumes. Rather than looking like soldiers dragged into a brutal, soul-crushing, ten-year campaign, the men often look like they've just shown up that morning, and had some dirt or dust rubbed onto them. Their weapons don't look used, and the buildings don't look lived in.<br /><br />For me, apart from the stunning visuals and the beautifully fluid camera work, the most outstanding thing in Troy is Achilles' fight scenes. Over many months, Brad Pitt was trained by swordsman Steven Ho, and he swings his sword with a poetically elegant and deadly style.<br /><br />There is a lot to marvel at in Troy: The eye-popping visuals, seamless CGI-rendered grandeur, and the epic battle scenes, but if the same attention to detail had been applied to the rest of the film, as it has to Pitt's swordplay, Troy might have been a truly classic epic film.</p></body></html>

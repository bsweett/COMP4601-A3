A top quality cast all give fine performances, resulting in an entertaining and intelligent film. This second quality is important, since we've all seen heist movies before, but this one adds something extra to proceedings by making the owner of the bank (the as always excellent Christopher Plummer) a leading player in film for reasons that only become obvious in the 2nd half of the film.<br /><br />This is more mainstream, than most Spike Lee films but he still stamps his own vision on the film. We should also be grateful that Spike realises the futility of buildings and cars exploding. Perhaps hollywood will learn one day. It goes without saying that the direction is good and the script equally so. Denzel Washington shares the acting honours with Plummer, if only because Clive Owen is behind a mask most of the time.<br /><br />I have only seen the film once, but can imagine that it will improve with a few more viewings. Recommended.</p></body></html>

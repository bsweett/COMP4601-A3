<meta name="summary" content=""Wild card!""></head><body><p>2002's "Insomnia" is one of the most quietly melancholy American movies I've ever seen--all the characters (with the exception of Hillary Swank's annoyingly idealistic female detective Ellie Burr) are somehow grimy and have something to hide.<br /><br />Robin Williams plays a really good creep.  "One Hour Photo" was a movie with a lot of potential that ultimately went nowhere, but he sure makes up for it here as the effeminate failed writer and murderer of a 17 year old girl. Williams successfully underplays the role of a neurotic psychopath (Walter Finch) whose pathos we see emerge in the smallest and most pivotal moments, thereby making them even more disturbing.<br /><br />The cinematography is damn near perfect--the Alaskan wilderness is a perfect backdrop for Det Will Dormer's (Al Pacino) psychological meltdown and inability to sleep.  The time zone and his entire life is closing in on him slowly: a previous investigation in which he planted evidence to convict another child killer is beginning to catch up with him.  On top of this, his younger partner (Martin Donovan) is forced to make a deal with internal affairs about the matter.  As if things could get worse, he accidentally shoots and kills him in a foggy gun battle where Finch is lurking.<br /><br />He is then forced to sink so low as to collaborate with Finch himself, who orchestrated the incident precisely for control of not only his fate but Dormer's.  The whole theme of dishonesty, even in the service of a just cause, gracefully winds around Dormer's neck like a noose.  The ending is as devastating as the entire film, with Swank's character given  the hope of redemption out of all this corruption.  A must see.</p></body></html>

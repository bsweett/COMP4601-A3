"Spider-Man 2" is even better than "Spider-Man" and raises the superhero movie bar.<br /><br />Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is now in college, trying to hold a part time job as a pizza delivery boy while also being a superhero and still taking the occasional photograph for J. Jonah Jameson (played to perfection by J.K. Simmons).  Threaded through all this is his deep love for Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  Unfortunately Peter is failing at nearly everything, even the superhero part.  Because Peter feels as though he must be a superhero first, he often delivers pizza late.  He is often late to class, and he still is unable to tell Mary Jane that he loves her.  To add insult to injury, Peter's powers are on the fritz from all the stress he is under.  In short, Peter's life is a disaster in slow motion.<br /><br />In addition to all the other stress Peter is under, Aunt May is being forced to move from her home.  Perhaps the single biggest reason for that is the death of Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson), which was partially Peter's fault and for which he continues to feel guilt.<br /><br />Peter is getting near a low when he goes to a demonstration by Doctor Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) of a new technique for creating fusion.  As part of his technique, Dr. Octavius has created a unique set of arms that allow him to directly manipulate the fusion process.  The arms have their own built in artificial intelligence that will enable Dr. Octavius to more easily control them.  Dr. Octavius is asked how he will keep the artificial intelligence (AI) from controlling him once the arms tap into his nervous system.  He explains that there is a specially designed chip that blocks the AI from taking over his brain.<br /><br />Dr. Octavius begins the experiment, which goes horribly awry, killing his wife Rosalie (Donna Murphy), and nearly killing Harry Osborn (James Franco), who was saved, barely, by Spider-Man.  However, Harry still hates Spider-Man and what he did to his father Norman Osborn, aka Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), and once the AI arms take over Dr. Octavius's brain, Harry agrees to provide Doc Ock, aka Dr. Octopus (his new improved name with the extra limbs), with tritium in exchange for Doc Ock bringing Spider-Man to him.  The reason that Doc Ock needs the tritium is to create another fusion generator.  Unfortunately, the fusion generator needs a lot more perfection, and if he succeeds the design has the potential of destroying far more than the city.<br /><br />As you can perceive, there is a significant amount of complexity in this movie.  However, Director Sam Raimi manages to keep the elements coherent and believable.  While there was a point where I wondered how much lower Peter Parker could go before losing it all together, and I started to get a little frustrated with the constant depression he faced, the deep angst provided an excellent contrast as Peter slowly overcame his problems.  It is the depth of character development that makes this movie different from "Superman" and "Batman."  While "Superman" touched on Clark Kent's difficulties in being a person as well as a superhero, the focus of the movie was on his powers.  "Batman" did a much better job of character development, but even then the principal focus was on the one event in Bruce Wayne's life that caused him to become the Batman.<br /><br />In "Spider-Man 2" we see someone a lot like us, a person that has not only bad days, but perhaps bad years, where nothing seems to go right.  But we also see Spider-Man figuratively pick himself up, mentally challenge himself to overcome his problems, and do exactly that.  While Peter's life will never be perfect, for a superhero and a human, it may be somewhat normal.<br /><br />I am typically ambivalent regarding special feature versions on DVD that contain two discs because the second disc is often not worth the price.  However, in the case of this release there are a number of interesting features worth watching for those who appreciate the technology behind the special effects.  I was particularly fascinated by how the Dr. Octopus's arms were animated.  The blooper reel (which had a few funny moments but also had a number of not-so-funny moments) showed Alfred Molina trying to take a drink provided by one of his mechanical arms; a good trick once perfected sufficiently to appear in the movie.  There are numerous other features to show how some of the more interesting effects were created.<br /><br />Historically, it has been difficult to bring comic book heroes to life.  Technology has been one of the biggest barriers, and has made it easier to create animated characters than live characters.  Now that technology has overcome much of that hurdle, the next difficulty is to make the characters human.  This movie has focused significant effort on developing Peter Parker as a young adult with all the normal problems of a young adult, with the added difficulty of being a superhero.  While some may cringe at how real life is for Peter, with the incredible angst created by all his problems, others will applaud the excellent translation from modern comics to the big screen.  Tobey Maguire, Sam Raimi, and the excellent supporting cast have made Spider-Man seem real.  In the process of making Spider-Man real they have also created a sequel greater than the original, and created a movie worthy of joining "Superman" and "Batman" was a landmark superhero movie that is destined to become a classic.</p></body></html>

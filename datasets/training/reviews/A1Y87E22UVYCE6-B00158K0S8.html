<meta name="summary" content="Patton: the Armored General."></head><body><p>I've seen this movie more than once. In my opinion is one of the best war films focused on an historical character.<br /><br />Based on Ladislas Farago's biography, having General Omar Bradley as consultant and Francis Ford Coppola coauthoring the screenplay the film has a very solid base.<br />George C. Scott characterization is absolutely anthological. He earned the Oscar for this work. It is amazing, knowing the personal beliefs of the actor, how he was capable to flesh so vividly and accurately Patton's personality. Without overacting, he puts enough fire and at the same time deep sensibility to this contradictory warrior.<br /><br />The film opens with a speech given by Patton to his troops and follows the General from Africa to Germany, snap shooting him in almost every critical moment; reflecting his fears (to be hit by a bullet in the nose), his rages (with the soldier he repute as coward), his visions of the past (conducting the jeep to an ancient battleground), his sensibility (in front of his wounded soldiers), his indiscretions (giving an inconvenient speech in England). Recapitulating: all the complex mixture that compounded his career is present.<br /><br />Minor flaws of the movie: a very mild picturing of General Bradley (may be due to his counseling work), an exaggerated Monty's competition with Patton (it is more likely Patton feeling the itch) and last but not least inaccurate tanks showing up. The sum of all of them, casts a very small shadow onto this monumental film.<br /><br />If you are interested in WWII history or war movies you can't miss this one!<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></body></html>

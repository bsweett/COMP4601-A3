Well this is how it was, and full marks to Cam Crowe and his insanely talented team for blessing us with this dead-on insight into the world of a touring Rock band and the role of the journalistic 'Enemy'.<br /><br />Cameron and wife Nancy Wilson of Heart even wrote many of the songs, including the superb Fever Dog, with some additional contributions from music guru and Rock God, Peter Frampton. There is also a delightful cameo by Peter as the Humble Pie manager, Reg. Peter was the Pie's lead guitarist, along with the sadly late Stevie Marriott.<br /><br />Not only is this a flawless piece of casting, including the always excellent Frances McDormand as Pat's Mom, but the band are totally believable, even though Billy Crudup and the brilliant Jason Lee weren't even musicians at the outset. You don't get a piece of this quality without a great deal of hard work, research, and attention to detail, and between Peter Frampton and Cameron himself, they have ensured that the finished product is a work of Art.<br /><br />The Bootleg Cut is absurd value, featuring the extended version of the movie, plus the original and an excellent 6 track CD, which includes the Wilson-Crowe classics Fever Dog, Love Thing and Love Comes And Goes.<br /><br />Stillwater are totally believable as a band, musically and visually, and the Cleveland Concert (one of the numerous Special features) looks 100% genuine. Jason's Paul Rogers of Bad Company look is perfect, and his lip-synching is flawless. Likewise Billy's guitar playing.<br /><br />Kate Hudson absolutely shines, as does newcomer Patrick Fugit, who plays 'Cameron'. Naturally, to quote Jason, "the chicks are good", as you might expect with a collection of stunning and talented actresses that includes Kate, Fairuza Balk, Anna Paquin, Olivia Rosewood and Bijou Phillips. Yes, it's a BabeFest.<br /><br />Easily one of the best movies I have ever seen, with a simply stunning soundtrack. Aaaaaah The Rain Song...<br /><br />Take me now, Fairuza...</p></body></html>

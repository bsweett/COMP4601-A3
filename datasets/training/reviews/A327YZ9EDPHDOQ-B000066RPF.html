<meta name="summary" content="After 30 plus years, it is still outrageously funny!!"></head><body><p>After watching the musical production Monty Python's SPAMALOT this summer I could not resist in purchasing the DVD of this 1975 movie featuring the greatest comedy troupe ever! Here we are, 30 years later and it is still the most outrageous film with Monty Python. I think the real attribute is the work of Terry Gilliam's animation that was featured. This is a must for all Python fans and for those who have seen or plan to see SPAMALOT! Buy this DVD..You won't be disappointed!!!</p></body></html>

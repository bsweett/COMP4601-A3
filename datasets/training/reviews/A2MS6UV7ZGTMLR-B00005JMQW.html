Director Sam Raimi, Screenwriter Alvin Sargent, and the Spider-Man Producers all seem to appreciate this fact. Following the runaway success, both critically and commercially, of the original film, in Spider-Man 2 they have expertly crafted an exciting action film, with surprising depth. As Raimi and Sargent have chosen to focus on their characters and story as much as the amazing SFX and action sequences, the end result is a plot-driven, roller-coaster ride filled with action, suspense, drama, and romance.<br /><br />The very talented and creative Stan Lee created Spider-Man for Marvel Comics. (Lee is also responsible for the Fantastic Four, the X-Men, Iron Man, and the Hulk). Spider-Man made his debut in 1962 in a comic book series - Amazing Fantasy 15. Spider-Man was immediately popular, and the series was quickly renamed Amazing Spider-Man. Indeed, the growing popularity of Spider-Man helped Marvel Comics to become the dominant comic-book publisher by the early 1970s.<br /><br />In 2002, Spider-Man: The Motion Picture came to the big screen. With a cumulative box office gross of over $US800 million, Spider-Man happily sits in the Top 10 of all-time box-office films. Apart from its great commercial success, Spider-Man was also warmly greeted by critics and comic-book fans alike.<br /><br />A long-time Spider-Man fan, Raimi, and star Tobey Maguire had both contracted for three Spider-Man films (before the script for the first one was even written), so following the success of the first film, sequels were inevitable.<br /><br />Thus, the arrival of Spider-Man 2 was not a surprise. Spider-Man 2 also earning a place in the all-time Top Ten Box Office films was also not a surprise. The amazing CGI, visual effects and SFX generally in the sequel were not a surprise. Furthermore, the breath-taking stunts and gripping action set pieces were not a surprise either. What was surprising about Spider-Man 2 was the depth of the story and characters.<br /><br />What I, and I imagine most people, love about Peter Parker/Spider-Man is that despite being a super hero, he is spared none of the problems of ordinary life: He has ups and downs with his friends, family, and employers. He struggles to get or keep a girlfriend. He gets sick and he definitely gets tired. A bit of a geek, he's "intelligent but lazy". A genuine nice guy, with a good sense of humour. Indeed, he's often referred to as "your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man". Peter's an ordinary young bloke, with an amazing gif, which he chooses, with great responsibility, to use for the good of humanity.<br /><br />In Spider-Man 2 we find Peter (Tobey Maguire) at the end of his tether. He's struggling to hold on to his job, pay the rent, and pass his exams. Furthermore, he seems to be losing his Spider-Man powers. And, the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), is engaged to another man. To make matter worse, his best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), blames Spider-Man for his father's death, and is seeking revenge, and Peter's Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) is about to be kicked out of her house.<br /><br />A strong theme in Spider-Man 2 is choice: Consumed by insecurity and inner turmoil, the strain of being a super-hero permanently on call is taking its toll. Peter's secret identity is a weight on his shoulders that he no longer wishes to bear. Peter must choose between what he wants to do and what he feels he must do.<br /><br />Instead of creating a stand-alone film, Raimi has opted to further explore the characters and relationships he set up in the first film. All the main characters in Spider-Man 2 have dreams: Peter dreams of an ordinary life where he can pursue his love for Mary Jane, and his love of science and photography; Mary Jane dreams of success as an actress, and of being happily married; and Dr. Otto Octavius dreams of creating a new energy source through fusion. And this brings us to our villain . . .<br /><br />Every hero is measured by their nemesis, the villain, and unlike the Hulk, Spider-Man 2 is not all soul-searching. Dr. Otto Octavius (a wonderfully restrained and subtle performance by Alfred Molina) is a good-hearted and genius scientific researcher, working for Oscorp. Peter admires Octavius, just as he did Norman Osborn (before Osborn became the Green Goblin). Octavius dreams of creating cheap renewable electricity through fusion. Tragically, his fusion experiment goes horribly wrong, killing Octavius' devoted wife, and leaving him with four robotic tentacles ("actuators") fused into his spinal cord. The evil AI of the actuators soon begin controlling Octavius, and the mild mannered scientist degenerates into Doc Oct, a cruel, selfish man, driven by vengeance, and hell-bent on achieving his fusion dream no matter what the costs.<br /><br />As for the DVD,the quality of the movie and its transfer, and the breadth of extras, easily make this one of the best DVD releases of 2004.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the best comedies of all-time"></head><body><p>Some Like it Hot is a classic comedy that fully deserved the nod as the #1 comedy of all-time according to the American Film Institute.  Joe and Jerry are two down on their luck musicians in Chicago who cannot find a job.  When they accidentally witness a gangland murder, the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, the musicians must find a way out of town.  Disguised as women, Josephine and Daphne, the two join an all-girl band heading to Florida.  Joe takes a liking to one of the band members, Sugar, and Jerry must deal with an old millionaire who falls in love with him.  What follows is some of the funniest stuff ever put on the screen.  With a great cast, a perfect script, and a jazzy musical score, Some Like it Hot is a can't miss movie.  If you haven't seen it, buy this movie.  It will keep you rolling around on the ground throughout.<br /><br />  Marilyn Monroe shows some of her comedic ability, along with other abilities, as Sugar Kane, a ukelele-playing singer in the band searching for a young millionaire to marry.  Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon are perfectly cast as Joe, "Josephine," and Jerry, "Daphne," two musicians who must disguise themselves as women to escape the wrath of the mob.  The chemistry and dialogue between Curtis and Lemmon is the high point of the movie.  Joe E. Brown is excellent as Osgood Fielding III, a persistent millionaire who takes a liking to Daphne.  George Raft plays mob boss Spats Colombo with Mike Mazurki and Harry Wilson as his henchmen.  The movie also stars Pat O'Brien, Nehemiah Persoff, Joan Shawlee, and Dave Barry.  The Special Edition DVD offers widescreen presentation, "A Nostalgic Look Back" a great 30-minute interview with Tony Curtis and Leonard Maltin, "The Sweet Sues" a featurette with interviews from members of the all-girl band, an extensive interactive photo gallery, a pressbook gallery, a Some Like it Hot trailer, and trailers from six other Billy Wilder movies.

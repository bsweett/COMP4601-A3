Though it is often imitated, spoofed even like for instance a scene in 'Swingers,' it seems like it uses a lot of gimmicks, and even though said gimmicks are pretty much Tarantino's style, in later works, i.e. 'Pulp Fiction,' he is able to better integrate those gimmicks into a seamless tapestry.<br /><br />It seemed very fresh and original at the time, but it may be getting a bit stale now, past its sell-by date. Like for instance, the scene where they plan the caper in the restaurant while discussing Madonna. Flash forward to 'Pulp Fiction' where they discuss what cheeseburgers are called in various European cities.<br /><br />---------------<br />Mr. Orange: Personally, I can do without her.<br />Mr. Blue: I like her early stuff. You know, 'Lucky Star', 'Borderline' - but once she got into her 'Papa Don't Preach' phase, I don't know, I tuned out.<br />Mr. Brown: Hey, you guys are making me lose my... train of thought here. I was saying something, what was it?<br />==============================<br /><br />Or how about where Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) does an interpretive dance/Vincent Van Gogh impression to the sounds of "Stuck in the Middle With You" by Stealer's Wheel?<br /><br />------------<br />You can say anything you want cause I've heard it all before. All you can do is pray for a quick death, which you ain't gonna get.<br />[He removes his razor]<br />Mr. Blonde: You ever listen to K-Billy's "Super Sounds of the Seventies" weekend? It's my personal favorite.<br />============================<br /><br />Can't remember specifically where in 'Pulp Fiction' he used this gimmick to better effect, but it is oh-so Tarantinoesque, and if Quentin didn't do it in 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Kill Bill, Volumes I and II' then a tsunami of imitators that followed in his wake surely did.<br /><br />Funny how even though it is a caper movie, the actual caper is never seen, only the events before and after, not the actual caper itself. Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen (did you know this guy actually published an award winning book of poetry?), Steve Buscemi: awesome.<br /><br />Key Cast Members of Reservoir Dogs:<br /><br />Harvey Keitel ...

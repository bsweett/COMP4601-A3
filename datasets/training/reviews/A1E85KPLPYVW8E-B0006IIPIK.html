A lot of the CGI in this film is just beautiful. But as it succeeded in producing eye opening visuals, its storyline was unmatched in strength. The plot was weak overall and rather formulaic. Another thing that made me mad about this flick was that Agelina Jolie, as it seemed to me, was advertised in the trailers as a major character in the film. I actually expected her to be the Sky Captain or the villian, but as it turned out she had a very minor role and had about 10 minutes of show time.<br />If you're into $150 million dollar budgets that are overflowing with special effects and action scenes and you could care less about story or character development, this one's for you. If you are not easily distracted by massive visuals in a movie and pay attention to storyline, you might or might not want to skip this one.</p></body></html>

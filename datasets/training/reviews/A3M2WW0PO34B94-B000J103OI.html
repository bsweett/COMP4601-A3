<meta name="summary" content="Streep's Great Performance Far Outshines "Devil""></head><body><p>Andrea (Anne Hathaway, "The Princess Diaries", "Brokeback Mountain"), fresh out of Northwestern University and clutching her journalism degree, arrives in New York looking for her first job in publishing. At her only interview, she is offered the choice of working at a Car magazine or as the second assistant to Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), demanding editor of "Runway", THE fashion industry bible. The first meeting does not go well, but Emily (Emily Blunt), Miranda's first assistant informs her she got the job. The next morning, Andrea receives a call at 6:15 am and realizes she is way out of her depth. One day  Nigel (Stanley Tucci), Miranda's favored Print Editor, gives Andrea the lowdown; she hasn't been able to get a handle on the job because she thinks the job is below her. Realizing he is right, Andrea seeks his help with a fashion makeover and she soon proves adept at the job, surprising her boyfriend, Nate (Adrian Grenier, HBO's "Entourage") and a respected writer (Simon Baker) who shows an interest in more than just giving her help her publish `real' writing.<br /><br />"The Devil Wears Prada", based on the enormously popular bestseller, has finally made it to the screen. It is an oft-told tale, many times in a more compelling fashion, but a standout performance and some funny moments help the film stand out. Barely.<br /><br />It is difficult to watch a great actor in a film that doesn't live up to their performance. Meryl Streep is a great actress, but I can be objective ("Prime", "A Prairie Home Companion"). "Prada" is overall better than her previous few films, but it is still along way from great. But Streep is by far the best thing in the film, her performance is outstanding. As Miranda, the demanding, bitchy editor of a "Vogue" like magazine, she embodies the character so fully, we feel a chill running down our spine every time she walks on screen. Many bosses are demanding, domineering and manipulative but the difference is Miranda lives and breathes the job and this magazine. It is her life. As such, she expects her assistants to be able to get things done. Of course, there are bosses out there who take this to the extreme; they begin speaking in shorthand, ask for more things than one person can handle, make outrageous demands. This is where the comedy comes in.<br /><br />It wouldn't be unusual or amusing if Miranda were simply demanding, she has to be impossible. As soon as the office learns she is on her way, they quickly change out of sensible, comfortable shoes into more fashionable pumps. Every morning when she comes in, she dumps her purse and coat on the desk of her second assistant and ignores Andrea's greeting before entering her own office to find a super hot Starbucks and the competitor's magazines laid out on her desk. She expects her assistants to work miracles; get stores to open early (which they do, for Miranda), get the new, unpublished Harry Potter book, the like. Amazingly, Andrea learns how to do this and becomes quite adept.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The geopolitical necessity of gun running"></head><body><p>Director Andrew Niccol depicts the frivolous aggrandizement of a contemporary armaments merchant Yuri Orlov played by Nicolas Cage in "Lord of War".  Cage, a Ukrainian emigre leading a dead end existence in Brooklyn's Brighton Beach, decides to dabble in the business of dealing arms.  Within short order he establishes himself in this dangerous business allying himself with scores of heartless and murderous despots in the process.<br /><br />Cage, who manages to glean a fortune from his enterprises, successfully is able to buffer himself from the slaughter wrought by his products.  He is able to maintain a lavish lifestyle, wooing and marrying the woman of his affections model Ava played by the attractive Bridget Moynahan.  His younger brother Vitaly who is his partner played by Jared Leto, however soon succumbs to the pressure, falling into the abyss of cocaine addiction.<br /><br />Throughout the film Cage is monitored and chased by federal investigator Jack Valentine played by Ethan Hawke.  Hawke plays a role analogous to Inspector Javert to Cage's Jean Valjean in Les Miserables finally trapping his long pursued prey.<br /><br />The finale, however tries to, unsuccessfully in my view, affirm the justification for this allegedly indispensible endeavor.</p></body></html>

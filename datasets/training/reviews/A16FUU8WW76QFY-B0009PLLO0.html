Alas, Green's book is far more interesting than Oliver Stone's long and tedious "Alexander".  Colin Farrell is badly miscast as the Macedonian conqueror; he spends the entire film crying, whining and generally overacting to the point that this viewer actually dreaded his next scene.<br /><br />In point of fact, just about everyone is miscast in "Alexander", particularly Angelina Jolie, who is obviously too young to be the central character's mother.  The one saving grace is Val Kilmer as Alexander's father, Philip.  Kilmer gives life to Philip's drunken antics; it is known that the Macedonians were very fond of drinking to excess-Alexander himself killed one of his top commanders, Cleitus, in another alcohol-fueled confrontation (shown all too graphically in the film).<br /><br />Much of the chronology in the film is accurate (though Stone's flashbacks will confuse those with limited knowledge of Alexander's life).  Two major battles of Alexander's Asian campaign are portrayed:  Gaugamela (thought to be near Mosul in modern day Iraq), and The Hydaspes in what is now Pakistan.  Unfortunately neither the place nor the opposing commander (the Indian King Porus) in the latter battle are even mentioned in the film.  I felt the Granicus River, the place where Alexander first met the Persian King Darius III in battle after crossing into Asia, would have made a better subject than the gigantic Gaugamela.  Alexander was badly wounded there, but recovered.  Granicus was a nearly evenly matched affair, which could have gone either way.<br /><br />More than 2,300 years after his death, Alexander's exploits have become legend. Many episodes in Alexander's life are well known in our day: the first encounter with his famed horse Bucephalus (perhaps the first equine in recorded history to be known by name), to the aforementioned murder of Cleitus, to his deathbed, where he refused to name a successor among his commanders.  Somehow the film deflates these occurrences; by trying to make Alexander almost godlike, Stone undercuts the import of them.<br /><br />Even though the timeline is largely right, the film simply does not have "life"; it is told in an almost comatose fashion.  Ridley Scott's "Gladiator" had similar elements, yet was never boring-even the calmer periods of the film were well-acted and held the viewer's interest.  "Alexander" plods along to the next battle, personal confrontation or intrigue without much fanfare.<br /><br />Alexander the Great is acknowledged by just about anyone with a brain as the greatest military commander of all time-he never lost a battle in his short 32 years of life-but this film falls far short of doing his legacy justice.  The biggest flaw in the film is casting Colin Farrell in a role that is clearly beyond his abilities.  One star.</p></body></html>

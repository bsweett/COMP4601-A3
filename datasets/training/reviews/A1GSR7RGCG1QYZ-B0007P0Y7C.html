While there were some decent action sequences coupled with some very impressive villains, it was ultimately the unrealistic story and constantly changing characters that will leave your head lost in the clouds.  Throughout the film, Garner's character of Elektra is never defined.  As often as the scenery changes in this film, as does Garner's portrayal of Elektra.  One moment she is this heartless killer, and within a few short minutes, she is the most compassionate creature to be released by the comics.  It literally made no sense.  Who was she?  What was her true purpose?  Why (this is always a good question)?  Was she looking for compassion and love?  I have no clue, and this film took no effort to disclose the truth.  Instead, we are forced to jump back and forth trying to decipher these basic elements that were never covered in this film.  Couple with this some evil villains that were aesthetically pleasing to the eye, but that is all and you have the butchered comic release of Elektra.<br /><br />My initial thought about this film was that director Rob Bowman didn't do enough research on this character to correctly bring her to life.  I have personally never read any of the comics, but I did see the film Daredevil, and I must admit Garner did provide the perfect opportunity to avoid looking at Ben Affleck, and I must say that I was interested in seeing how she was going to expand her character.  Let me tell you how she did it ... she took away any boundaries and borders.  Garner created this character that floated through each scene without creating any substance.  At one point she would be ruthless, then mere seconds later, Garner would show some sympathy towards one of the characters that would surpassingly seem out of character, because instantly she would transform back.  There was no definition with her Elektra, which allowed for confusion and miscommunication to those involved in watching this film.  Perhaps Garner wasn't quite comfortable in this role, or maybe the writing just didn't allow her to fully define herself.  Whatever it was it transformed Garner from this encrypted character to just a fumbled mess of thoughts.<br /><br />With this said, one can also complain that this problem also occurred with the villains of this film.  I was so excited to finally see colorful and purely evil villains, that my excitement slowly died upon witnessing nothing happening with them.  There was no story, there was no moment of evil, there was nothing except a short glance of their faces followed by no lines coupled with impending death.  These guys were tough, and they had some superhero powers that Garner didn't even acknowledge.  It was yet again another glowing example of Rob Bowman not following through with the image of the comics and giving us "dead" characters.  After witnessing the "flip-floppery" of Elektra, I wasn't expecting it from the villains, but somehow they just appeared.  It then became apparent what Bowman had done wrong.  His focus was not on Elektra or her arch-nemesis, but instead of the graphics that were being created.  The story was weak, and I think Bowman knew that, so he spent a majority of his money on the CGI aspects of the film.  Which, strangely, worked.<br /><br />I must give this film some credit, and that would be solely to the special effects crew.  I thought visually this film was entertainment, but when you opened your ears, the remaining element just forced this film to crash and burn.  Bowman knew how to make a visually appealing film, and he succeeded, but if he could have continued to add a very exciting and unfaltering story line, then he would have had a masterpiece.  Instead, we are left with a horrible portrayal of Elektra by Garner, coupled with the cheesy Terrence Stamp moments that seem to all-so-well accompany the weakest, yet visually stunning, baddies this world has ever seen.  It was just a hodge-podge of troubles, and at the helm was director Rob Bowman.<br /><br />Overall, I wasn't impressed at all.  There were moments during this film where I thought it was going to go to a whole new level, but instead it just created a double negative effect.  In essence, the "fun" scenes were cancelled out by less important, nearly muted scenes.  Garner tried, but ultimately failed as this superhero.  She had the potential to really take this character to new levels, but thanks to the backward mind of Rob Bowman, she was unsuccessful.  I truly believe that the focus in this feature was pointed in the wrong direction, do not give us the best camera shot known to man, but instead powerful characters and a believable (and less Hollywood) plot.  This will give us a stronger character in the long run.  The largest disappointment to this film was the characters that felt as if they were forgotten about.  While I will never say that Daredevil was a better picture, but there are plenty of comic book films that do a better job of bringing their images to life.  Skip this one and go see Sin City.<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****</p></body></html>

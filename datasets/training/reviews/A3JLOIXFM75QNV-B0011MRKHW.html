<meta name="summary" content="Same director? Really?"></head><body><p>I adored the first Elizabeth. It was perfect in it's script and flawless in it's acting. After watching The Golden Age however, I was utterly distraught. I cannot believe that this is made by the same man who directed the first film. It just doesn't seem possible.<br />Everything from the script, to the editing to the actors that don't belong, it just doesn't work or flow. If there is one redeaming aspect of this film, it is the once again brilliant performance by Cate Blanchette. She can do no wrong. She is one of the most skilled actresses out there, anywhere. However, my gripe is actually with her character. She doesn't even seem to be the same Queen from the first Elizabeth. Granted, years have passed, but this Elizabeth comes off as weak and undecided, jittery even. It doesn't feel right. Abbie Cornish also feels very wrong as the Queen's favorite lady-in-waiting. She is very out of place, no matter the beautiful costume she is wearing.<br /><br />Samantha Morton as Mary Stewart is UTTERLY wasted. They could have just cast some unknown, so small and barely noticable a part she played. One of my favorite actors, Geoffry Rush was shamefully placed in the background and barely had anything to do with this film. His character was a favorite of mine in the first film.<br />Clive Owen is pointless in this. His character feels neither here nor there. Wrong choice in actors, I guess.<br /><br />The plot was also confusing, it jumped around way too much and you never really know how much time has passed. There is no mystery or intrigue. Nothing to captivate. The final and supposedly huge battle is a few boring minutes long and feels almost out of place.<br /><br />The costumes and wigs are magnificent, as in the first film.  Again, one of the only bright spots.<br /><br />This is an extrememly dissapointing film that probably should not have been made. It seems very unnecessary. This is definitely one of the instances where a sequel is so much worse than the original.</p></body></html>

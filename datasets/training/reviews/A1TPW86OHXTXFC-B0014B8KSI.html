Or at least, the way certain masters of the universe do, as they prowl the jungle in their sleek rides, armed with killer instincts and the will to power. It's a story about ethics and their absence, a slow-to-boil requiem for American decency in which George Clooney, the ultimate in luxury brands and playboy of the Western world, raises the sword in the name of truth and justice and good. Well, someone's got to do it. MANOHLA DARGIS<br /><br />I loved this movie. It felt like a throwback to the older films of yore, where truth and decency triumphed. And George Clooney as Michael Clayton is perfect in this role, and he is at the peak of his profession. As Mr Dargis says " George Clooney is a seducer of heavy hearts and troubled minds, the beautiful bearer of our very bad tidings."<br /><br />How wonderfully the characters and the film move on- it begins with a few scenes of yesterday. We see Michael Clayton looking at a fresh day from the top of a field and then boom, we are brought back to yesteryear and the days before in flashback style. Michael Clayton is a 'fixer, or "janitor" as he states in a high powered law firm. He wanted to be on the inside, but he is looking through the glass ceiling, just out of reach. He is being asked to keep his old friend, Arthur, THE high powered lawyer of the firm in check. It seems Arthur has come undone and throughout the movie we understand why and how and who did it.<br /><br />Tilda Swinton is the epitome of the "brittle, sexless, friendless, cheerless woman" as Darghas relates. She is a lawyer for a chemical company that Clayton's firm represents.  She is a woman possessed by her work, life and death and that is a reality. She dresses in the perfect suit and rehearses day and night her speeches, and after she gives them, runs into the bathroom to fix her dripping armpits.<br /><br />Each and every character from Sidney Lumet on are perfect in their roles. This is a movie about good and evil, ethics and the lack of them, life and death, justice and the lack there of, the best and the brightest.  Tony Gilroy has made a dramatic debut as director and this is one of the best movies of the year.  Michael Clayton talking to his son, and his son looking at him with the eyes of a young boy who loves and adores his father, is a tender moment in time.  George Clooney should not be overlooked for an Oscar- this is his best.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.  prisrob 02-22-08<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783229402">Out of Sight (Collector's Edition)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXRM">O Brother, Where Art Thou?</a></p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Matrix Rehashed"></head><body><p>"The Matrix" was an innovative,thought-provoking movie. It had a Buddhist/Christian allegory with the "Chosen One",Neo being "awakened" (like Buddha) to the reality of existence and being "resurrected" (like Jesus) through Trinity's kiss. It's an enjoyable,rip-roaring film.<br /><br />"Matrix Reloaded",on the other hand,is a major letdown. It has the special effects,the same trio of heroes (Neo,Trinity,Morpheus)..but lacks its soul. The spirituality of the first has been replaced with "look what we can do now." The heroic trio confronts the Merovignian (a legendary descendant of Jesus and Mary Magdalene),his cleavage-baring wife Persephone,as well as the albino Twins. These new villains are incredibly confusing,and don't have any basis in the first movie. Why do they even exist? As an excuse for fight scenes? At least Hugo Weaving returns as the only engaging villain,Agent Smith.<br /><br />There's a pointless orgy/rave scene in Zion that's supposed to be life-affirming. One expects to see Nelly Furtado emerging from the shadows to belt out "Maneater",but that's a FUN video,and a better song. Neo and Trinity have an unerotic consummation scene. It could've been incredibly sensual and romantic;but the leads lack chemistry. Perhaps the Wachowskis should've left the Neo/Trinity love scene to the imaginations of the viewers.<br /><br />"Matrix Reloaded" has some amazing visuals, especially at the end when Neo confronts the architect of the Matrix surrounded by TV monitors. The battle scenes,as always,are spectacles. Unfortunately,the human and mystical sides of the story are significantly absent.</p></body></html>

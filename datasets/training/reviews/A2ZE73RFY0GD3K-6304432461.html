<meta name="summary" content="The Work Ethic Alone Rates Five Stars"></head><body><p>It's Christmas Eve in Los Angeles -- but at Nakatomi Plaza in Century City, none of the Nakatomi Corporation's dedicated employees have gone home to their families.  Nope, they're all at the office, enjoying a lavish party courtesy of company funding, and breaking now and then for a little work.  Every other business in town has knocked off for the night, that Special Night, but not so at Nakatomi.  And when Bruce Willis shows up, his estranged wife Holly happens to be away in another room, &quot;faxing some documents&quot; -- presumably to the home office in Japan where, on the other side of the international date line, it's already Christmas morning... meaning that in Japan, somebody is at the office on Christmas morning awaiting Holly's fax from Los Angeles.  Such industry !!<p>This sort of Christmas Eve and Christmas Day work ethic is absolutely magnificent.  If everyone in the world would devote that degree of dedication to his/her job, our planet would run in greased grooves !!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="INFLUENTIAL AND FRANTIC SEQUEL"></head><body><p>"Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn" is one of the most influential horror sequels of all time. This movie changed the tone of the first movie and became a spoof movie. "Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn" mocks virtually of every cliche of the horror genre. Since this movie gain cult following, other franchises have copied its humorous style, horror franchises like "Child's Play", "A Nightmare On Elm Street" and "Friday The 13th" have shamelessly ripped-off "Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn", just check out "Bride Of Chucky" or "Freddy Vs. Jason".<br /><br />Also recent movies like "Idle Hands" are inspired by the "Evil Dead" series. Obviously, none of those movies is as satisfying as "Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn". The best thing in this movie is the camera work, the camera angles and the editing are so frantic and dynamic that you feel like you are flying in the enchanted woods of the movie. The possessed creatures move as fast as a feline, and are as aggressive as a grizzly bear, and that's really impressive, because these are not your typical flaccid, slow, fragile creatures that usually appear in horror movies.<br /><br />The director Sam Raimi has gained a cult following with the "Evil Dead" series, and now that he became a mainstream director with the "Spider-Man" movies, he has adapted some of his best tricks to those films, check out the camera angles of "Spider-Man" 1 & 2, also the editing is very fast like the kind of editing that he used in "Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn".</p></body></html>

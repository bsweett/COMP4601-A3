<meta name="summary" content="it would have been better without Beyonce or Britney!"></head><body><p>Mike Myers, next time you make an Austin Powers film, do not have pop star idiots. Beyonce absolutely sucks playing Foxxy Cleopatra. they should have used Diana Ross or any other African-American girl that sung in the Seventies. Beyonce was born in 1982. what does she have to do with the 1970's ? I said it before, and i'll say it again: Destiny's Child SUCKS! and I'll say this for the record: Britney Spears SUCKS too!</p></body></html>

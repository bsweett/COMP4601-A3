<meta name="summary" content="Spielberg Strikes Again!"></head><body><p>One can never underestimate director Steven Spielberg's ability to reinvent himself as a filmmaker.  MINORITY REPORT is just another example of this.<p>Set in Washington D.C. circa 2053, MINORITY REPORT is based ona 1956 short story by Philip K. Dick, whose works provided the source material for the ultra-violent 1990 smash TOTAL RECALL and Ridley Scott's 1982 cult masterpiece BLADE RUNNER.  Tom Cruise stars as the top cop of an elite anti-crime police unit called Pre-Crime, which has the ability, by way of three pre-cognitive beings, to see crimes of the future and stop not only the crimes but to stop the perpetrators from committing those crimes to begin with.<p>But when a national referendum on Pre-Crime takes shape, an unscrupulous underling (Colin Farrell) to the Attorney General puts a flaw into the system intended to lead to Pre-Crime's own undoing.  That flaw is a vision of Cruise himself committing murder against a man he doesn't even know and has never met.  Cruise becomes a man on the run, and the result is a hair-raising series of suspense-laden twists and turns that never bores, despite the fact that the film is two hours and fifteen minutes long.<p>Under Spielberg's always inventive direction, Cruise is sharp as the beleagured cop trying to get out of his most complicated fix.  Samantha Morton is also quite good as the "pre-cog" known as Agatha, and the legendary Max von Sydow scores as Cruise's boss and mentor who has a stake in seeing Pre-Crime remain perfect.  A film that deftly puts elements of the crime and psychological thriller film genres into its futuristic science fiction brew, MINORITY REPORT is a film that, like Spielberg's previous film A.I., may very well require more than one viewing; it certainly is not a leave-your-brains-at-the-door film.  But it is well worth seeing!</p></body></html>

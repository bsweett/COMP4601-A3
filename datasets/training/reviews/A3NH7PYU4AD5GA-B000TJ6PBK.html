Yes, Jackson is also there, in a good small part. Everybody else is secondary. Of course apart from the hotel room.<br />Cusack is a possibly talented (how would we know?) young writer who wastes his talent with trashy non-fiction about haunted places. You see where this leads, but it is so far above expectations. Of course he also has his private tragedy in his bio, which of course plays an important part in the story.<br />A question for literary research: is there a relation between King's story and Murakami's novel about the Wild Sheep Chase? Who is quoting whom with the odd Hotel Dolphin? Of course King's hotel goes quite a few steps further than Murakami's. On the other hand, the time warp with the surf board is straight out of a Murakami novel. Not to forget it is also a quote from Ambrose Bierce.<br />Marvellous stuff for unserious people who hate bad workmanship. There is none here.</p></body></html>

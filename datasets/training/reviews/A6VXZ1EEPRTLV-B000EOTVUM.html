His goal was to do a distinctly Australian horror thriller.  Apparently, elements from a real case involving a serial killer who preyed on hikers, and other actual crimes, were later incorporated into the screenplay.  While not strictly `based on actual events' as is stated at the beginning of the film, Wolf Creek is a chilling tale featuring a ruthless and sadistic predator, with a long history of murder and torture in the Australian outback.<br /><br />The killer is a bushman named Mick Taylor (John Jarratt), and his latest victims are a trio of visitors to Wolf Creek National Park.  Aussie Ben Mitchell (Nathan Phillips), is travelling with a couple of British tourists, dark haired Liz Hunter (Cassandra Magrath) and fair haired Kristy Earl (Kestie Morassi).  After spending the day hiking around the scenic meteor crater, the group find themselves alone and stranded, when their car fails to start.  Spending the night in the car, they are awakened by the arrival of a tow truck.  The driver Mick, seems friendly and willing to help, so they hitch up the car and tow it back to Mick's place, what appears to be some kind of mine somewhere deep in the boonies.  After a little supper around the campfire, the tourists bed down for the night with no worries, while good old Mick gets down to working on repairing their vehicle . . . . .<br /><br />. . . . . well unfortunately Mick is into brutality, rape, and torture, and for the three unlucky travelers, life will never be the same again.  Much of the film from this point forward follows the actions of Liz and Kristy as they attempt to escape from a sadistic killer, who is an expert hunter, tracker, and marksman.<br /><br />While there are some questionable plot developments that challenge logic, overall the story holds together pretty well, with a strong atmosphere of fear, urgency, and terror.  And when Mick gets riled up, he's one mean and nasty guy.  The grisly act of making a `head on a stick', is just a source of amusement for his twisted mind.  Not to reveal specifics, but this is one nightmare that doesn't end well.<br /><br />The DVD's special features include the `The Making of Wolf Creek' an excellent, extremely comprehensive documentary that covers most of the key aspects of the making of the film.  The film also has a commentary track with McLean, actors Kestie Morassi, and Cassandra Magrath, and executive producer Matt Hearn.  The commentary is informative, but being generally lighter in tone, at times it may seem somewhat inappropriate for the grim happenings on screen.  Wolf Creek was shot in high definition video, with much of the footage shot with the camera hand held.  The reasons for doing this were to give the film a `documentary' type look, capture high definition images, and also enable the film to be shot at a faster pace, and less expensively.<br /><br />Wolf Creek is an impressive feature film debut for writer/director Greg McLean, who succeeds in his goal of bringing to the screen the chilling story of a sociopathic killer loose in the Australian outback.  McLean would return to present another unique view of Australia in his next film, Rogue (2008), an exciting adventure featuring a giant killer crocodile.  Hopefully bigger and better things are in store for this filmmaker.</p></body></html>

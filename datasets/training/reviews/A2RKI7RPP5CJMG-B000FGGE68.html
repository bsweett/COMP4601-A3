<meta name="summary" content="Wimmer Wanes"></head><body><p>When Kurt Wimmer wrote and directed "Equilibrium," he managed to make a wonderful, lower-budget sci-fi flick that had a great story, plenty of action, and solid performances from actors such as the wonderful Christian Bale, Sean Bean, Taye Diggs, and Emily Watson.  When Wimmer cranked out "Ultraviolet," he was given a larger budget, an established action star in Milla Jovovich, and a really creepy kid who is perfect at playing a creepy kid (Cameron Bright).  So what does he do with these seemingly win-win elements?  He goes heavy, VERY heavy, on the action, heavy on the CGI, and tosses the actual acting performances to the wayside.<br /><br />Jovovich, Bright, and underrated character actor William Fichtner (also of "Equilibrium"), have absolutely nothing to work with in this story.  The reed-thin plot is based around Violet (Jovovich), a hemophage who's out to capture a weapon that can supposedly eliminate her kind on Earth.  It seems that every disease in the universe has been wiped out except for one that makes its victims look and act like vampires.  After capturing the weapon, however, Violet begins to question the motives of both her allies and her enemies and all of it sort of smashes along at breakneck speed until there is no one left to kill on the screen.<br /><br />This film wreaks of echoes of "Equilibrium."  From the armed soldiers who explode into powdery shards to the clean white uniforms worn by Violet and others in the flick, it seems as if Wimmer took what he felt were the coolest parts of his cult hit and threw it into this film hoping to cash in on it once again.  Even the gun-kata is tossed in!<br /><br />Visually, this is like a video game gone awry.  There's enough eye candy here to send you into fits.  Bright colors everywhere, chameleon-like outfit changes by Violet, and weapons that appear out of the air.  Wimmer unloaded his bag of visual tricks on this one.<br /><br />There is plenty of action here.  If that's your bag, you'll be right at home with "Ultraviolet."  However, if you enjoy an actual storyline to go along with the explosions and swordplay, I'd suggest you buy "Equilibrium" and leave "Ultraviolet" as a rental only.<br /><br />Not really recommended, unless you really enjoy action and nothing else.</p></body></html>

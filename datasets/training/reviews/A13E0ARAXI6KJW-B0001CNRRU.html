Having seen the other two superb films in his trilogy meditating on death, 1999's "Amores Perros" set in his native Mexico and last year's ambitiously international "Babel", I fully expected I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and screenwriter Guillermo Arriago to deliver something as audacious. Indeed they have with a gritty, heartfelt look at three disparate lives brought together by a single twist of fate and how each copes uniquely with the aftermath. Executed with even greater abandon than the other two films, the sequencing of plot developments in "21 Grams" is initially confusing, but the out-of-kilter pacing actually fits the jagged contours of the desultory story which deals with the unpredictability of life.<br /><br />The relentlessly downbeat tone can get wearing at least until the plot threads start to come together with greater force in the last third. The plot follows three people facing deeply personal challenges - Paul Rivers, an academic awaiting a donor for a life-saving heart transplant, as his impatient, English-born wife wants his sperm to have a baby by artificial insemination; Jack Jordan, an ex-con and born-again Christian struggling to keep a job to support his wife and two kids; and Cristina Peck, a happily devoted wife and mother who has a history of drug problems. Their lives intersect through a hit-and-run which results in fatalities and burgeoning flows of anger, guilt and resentment. Brief, time-juggled snippets of their individual lives are interspersed with obviously later scenes when the three come together under dire circumstances. Divulging any more of the story - which was apparently filmed chronologically despite the final editing - would dampen the propulsive dynamics generated by the constant second-guessing by the viewer.<br /><br />Fortunately, the three principals act with such fervent commitment to their characters that it is hard not to be compelled by the film in its entirety. In the most subdued performance of the trio, Sean Penn effectively plays Rivers as a dying man hoping to find some level of redemption for second chance he gets, often reacting with quiet force to the actions occurring around him. As Jack, Benicio del Toro is unafraid to exhibit the character's ugly side while sharply conveying his inability to cope with what he sees as his accountability in the tragic event. With a series of bravura moments, Naomi Watts lends palpable ferocity and a liberating lack of vanity to Cristina's inner torment.  There are a couple of sideline performances worth noting as well - Charlotte Gainsborough as Paul's insular wife Mary and especially Melissa Leo as Jack's tough-minded, self-protecting wife Marianne.<br /><br />The film has an intentionally bleached-out look thanks to Rodrigo Prieto's atmospheric cinematography, but the most impressive achievement is the filmmakers' insightful presentation of complex, multi-layered characters in ways that make these even their more unsavory actions understandable. Unfortunately, the original 2004 DVD offers no extras, but the 2006 Collector's Edition DVD does include the theatrical trailer and an interesting behind-the-scenes featurette, "21 Grams in Fragments", which spends a lot of time on the director's fascination with death and his motivation in making the film.</p></body></html>

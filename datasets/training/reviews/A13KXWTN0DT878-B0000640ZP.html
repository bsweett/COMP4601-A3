<meta name="summary" content="Wonderful, Thrilling Movie"></head><body><p>I saw The Others in theatres today, and although that was well over 5 hours ago, I'm still in awe. This is the first movie, I've EVER watched, that actually had me gripping my seat in suspense, not knowing what was going to happen next. There were times the pace was a bit slow, but it was only to give more shape to the plot, and I found all of those scenes interesting. Nicole Kidman gave a stunning performance as a religious, over protective mother of two young children who are resistant to any kind of light other than candle light. The 2 children in this movie are wonderful, and truly did very well. The remaining cast were also great. A movie with a completely great cast? Yep! The Others is a movie you can't give too much plot detail of, for it would ruin the entire thing. Therefore, this is going to be a pretty short review. But I must say, the ending is one to make you gasp or have to rethink the whole movie over. I wish I could talk more and more about The Others, but I would end up giving the whole thing away. It's a wonderful, thrilling movie with true scares that didn't require blood or a knife. I'm very much anticipating the DVD release.</p></body></html>

There's lots of action, drama, comedy and suspense in this film--it grabbed my attention and it never let go until the very end. The cinematography and the choreography were brilliantly done; and the acting was very convincing. The plot moves along at a good pace although I suppose they could have cut a couple of minutes here or there; but that is a minor issue.<br /><br />When the action starts, three estranged brothers who haven't even spoken for a year get together in India for what one of them, Francis L. Whitman (Owen Wilson), says is a spiritual journey so that they can connect again. Francis and his two brothers Peter L. Whitman (Adrian Brody) and Jack L. Whitman (Jason Schwartzman) all have unresolved issues. Nevertheless, they all meet just as Francis tells them to and they begin their journey across India on a train called The Darjeeling Limited.<br /><br />The character quirks make them so human, too. Francis is the control freak who even hires an assistant, Brendan (Wallace Wolodarsky) to make laminated daily "itineraries" so that every moment is structured. Peter is having a baby with his wife Alice from whom he simply "expects" to divorce someday; and Jack is estranged from his former girlfriend. Jack can't get her off his mind; we see that in the introduction to the movie when Jack and his ex (Natalie Portman) are alone together and later on in the actual film when he keeps checking her answering machine to monitor her incoming messages.<br /><br />Unfortunately, however, the brothers pick up a snake and when the snake gets loose the train conductor isn't exactly happy about having a snake onboard the train. The brothers alienate themselves even further from the train conductor when one of them accidentally breaks a glass window--the brothers go from being confined to their cabins to getting kicked off the train! Then the REAL adventure begins--they continue their journey. On their way, they find three boys drowning; and sadly they can only save two of the three young boys. The funeral for the dead youth immediately brings back memories of their father's funeral one year earlier.<br /><br />But there's still more. Their mother, Patricia Whitman (Anjelica Huston), has run off to be a nun. When Francis finally tells his brothers that the real reason they're in India is to find their mother and ask her why she wasn't at their father's funeral Peter and Jack feel very uncertain about things.<br /><br />Do they get to see their mother--and, if they do, how will that go? She might not want to see them. There's also a man-eating tiger about; will that cause these three men any danger? And what about their own issues of sibling rivalry--how will those feelings be dealt with when the brothers are together on this long journey? Will there be a problem when Jack has some romantic time alone with Rita (Amara Karan), the stewardess on The Darjeeling Limited? Watch and find out!<br /><br />The DVD has a featurette on the making of the film entitled The Darjeeling Limited: Walking Tour; and the music is very pretty.<br /><br />The Darjeeling Limited is an outstanding film that hits home with spot on performances by great actors. The people in this film could be taking this type of trip just about anywhere and at just about any point in time; it's truly about emotions, sibling relationships, relationships between adult children and their parents and the realities of life and death. I highly recommend this film.</p></body></html>

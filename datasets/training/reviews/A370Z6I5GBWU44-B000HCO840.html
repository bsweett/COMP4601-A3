<meta name="summary" content="wow!"></head><body><p>'Last Stand' certainly is an appropriate title for this film. Like the first two movies, canon is altered, making Jean Grey's Phoenix force a dark part of her subconscious rather than a separate entity like in the comic series. Still, it is a pretty cool movie and the storyline is different from the others, so this movie doesn't feel like a rehash.</p></body></html>

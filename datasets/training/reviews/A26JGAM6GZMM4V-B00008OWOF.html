<meta name="summary" content="And They Did"></head><body><p>This is a generally entertaining film with lesser ambitions than comparable films such as The Great Impostor (1961) and -- at least to some extent --  Zelig (1983) and Chamelon Street (1989). Directed by Steven Spielberg, Catch Me If You Can is mostly based on the autobiography of Frank W. Abagnale, Jr., played by Leonardo DiCaprio. His performance is adequate but overshadowed by those of Christopher Walken (as Frank Sr.) and Tom Hanks (as Carl Hanratty, a character created by Spielberg and Jeff Nathanson who wrote the screenplay). Given Frank Jr.'s charm which seems natural to DiCaprio, it is easy to understand how quickly he could deceive so many different people, both in the United States and abroad. More difficult for me to understand is how Frank Jr. -- as portrayed by DiCaprio -- could sustain that deception almost indefinitely. <p>I just wish the film had devoted more attention to the exceptional cunning which was obviously required of Frank Jr. to devise so many ingenious strategies and tactics. For example, he recognized the benefits of having others' bank deposits credited to his own account so he devised a way by which to print slips bearing his account number. He then replaced blank deposit slips in bank branches with his own deposit slips. I also wish more attention had been devoted to examining Frank Jr.'s compulsive need to assume others' identities. Deep down, was he ashamed of his father? Was he ashamed of himself? I am also curious to know how he could betray the confidence of so many decent people and still remain so cheerful, even playful, even after he was finally apprehended. Perhaps Spielberg should be blamed for casting DiCaprio or perhaps the two of them should be blamed for a poorly developed character. In fact, other than Frank Sr. and perhaps Hanratty, none of the characters in this film is sufficiently developed. Hence the Four Star rating which includes one for the Walken and Hanks performances and another for the special features.<p>To repeat, Catch Me If You Can is frequently entertaining. However, after seeing it again recently, I again wondered if the real Frank Jr. could gain my confidence as easily as he did others. Probably...but DiCaprio's Frank Jr. couldn't.</p></body></html>

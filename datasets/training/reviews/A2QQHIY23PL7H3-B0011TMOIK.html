<meta name="summary" content="The series advances"></head><body><p>Chamber of Secrets is of course the adaptation of the second book in the successful Harry Potter series, and finds the gang at Hogwarts racing to uncover a great evil that has been released upon the students again. In terms of translating the book to film, 'Chamber' is much more successful than the original, if only because the story is more focused and there is a stronger, hands-on climax that gives Harry something to do. In comparison to the third and fourth films, Chamber of Secrets was also the last movie where major chunks of the original story were not cut out or re-written. There are bits missing, but they aren't as obvious. It also started the trend of the series taking on a darker tone, so parents might want to watch this one with younger kids.<br /><br />Warner Bros did a decent job with the dvd edition. The film presentation is solid. The extras are a mix of kids games and useful production information. Not a huge ton of stuff, but worth checking out. In all, Chamber of Secrets is a successful continuation of the movie franchise. The stakes are greater than the first, and none of the magic world of Harry Potter has been lost.

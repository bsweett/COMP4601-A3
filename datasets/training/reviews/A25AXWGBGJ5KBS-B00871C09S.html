<meta name="summary" content="The unfolding of an origami bird..."></head><body><p>A film destined for over-analysis, &quot;Rear Window&quot; deserves it's place in the pantheon of great films.<br />Instead of thinking about it so much, just watch the film and surrender to it's lovely storytelling style. It's like unfolding an origami bird to see what's on the original square piece of paper. (Notice I didn't say origami &quot;crane&quot;, because that would be more apropos for another film circa 1960.)<br />The acting is superb, the script is unusually crafty, and the quips are appropriately tension-easing. The film attracts attention to it's style, yet manages to make you succumb to it.<br />We KNOW Hitchcock is a master. It's just nice to be reminded time and again, isn't it?</p></body></html>

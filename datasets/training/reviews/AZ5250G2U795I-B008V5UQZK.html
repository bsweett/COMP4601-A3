<meta name="summary" content="My Big, Fat Great Movie!"></head><body><p>This movie is absolutely WONDERFUL! Being Swiss, I can honestly say I have very little experience with Greek Culture, and found myself wanting to hop the first boat to Athens by the end of watching it.<br />Vardolos has written a film that deftly celebrates love, family, and heritage. It's difficult to throw these elements into a comedy without crossing the dangerous borderline of parody, and she does this beautifully. You find yourself appreciating the nuances of this film's portayal of a culture you may not be familliar with because you see your own family in hers, no matter what the nationality.<p>And John Corrbett should just plan on a career as a romantic lead. His Ian is the perfect man you would want for yourself, best friend, daughter, etc. Corbett brings a 'dreamboat' presence that resonates with romantic honesty and charm, and he also manages to be 'everyguy.' His character works because he never seems 'out of your league' perfect.<p>Michael Constantine is brilliant at Tula's father. His Greek ethinicy is brilliantly conveyed in ecentricities that are actually more particular to fatherhood than Greek culture.<p>This is a wonderful little film that will make you long to fall in love if you haven't already, and make you appreciate who you love if you are in love. You cannot miss with this film, and the DVD is a must own because you will just watch it too many times to justify rerental fees.</p></body></html>

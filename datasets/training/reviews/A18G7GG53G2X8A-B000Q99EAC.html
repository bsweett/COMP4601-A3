For whatever it's worth, I tend to favor the latter interpretation. While it isn't perfect, I still greatly enjoyed this movie. It's a heartfelt story written and directed by Sylvester Stallone, one that manages to steer clear of becoming sappy, preachy, or melodramatic. Yes, the climactic fight scene is also entertaining, but it's nowhere near as important as what takes place early on. Just like the original 1976 film, this is not a story about boxing; it's about amounting to something amidst the realities of everyday living. Stallone created an underdog character, representing the everyman who wanted a chance at greatness.<br /><br />In some ways, these underlying themes take on even greater significance than when they were presented thirty years ago. Still living in Philadelphia, Rocky Balboa (Stallone) is now an aging restaurant owner. Consumed with remorse over the death of his beloved Adrian, he begins to wonder whether or not he still has what it takes to get through life. It's apparent on the anniversary of her death that he needs to go in a different direction; not only does he visit her grave, he and Paulie (Burt Young)--Adrian's brother--also visit all the spots where Adrian and Balboa were together. They stop by the pet store where she and Balboa looked at birds. They stand on the stoop of Balboa's home, where he envisions her as she once appeared. They even visit the vacant lot of the now demolished ice skating rink. When at this location, Paulie loses himself, feeling as if he has no right to remind himself of his sister (who he treated badly).<br /><br />His last stop is a sleazy little bar, where he meets the local bartender, Marie (Geraldine Hughes). As it turns out, she's the same Marie that Balboa walked home thirty years ago, back when she was just a young girl ("Screw you, creepo!" were her final words to him). They immediately strike up a friendship, made stronger with the introduction of her son, nicknamed Steps (James Francis Kelly III). For whatever reason, they motivate Balboa into random acts of kindness, such as employing them both for his restaurant. While Marie is certainly grateful, she has a hard time understanding why he's being so generous. "You don't owe us nothing," she says one night as Balboa replaces the bulb of her porch light. "Why do you have to owe something to get something?" is his simple yet significant reply. This scene worked especially well because so much was being said with so few words; a lot of this film works on that level (it made me think twice about criticizing Stallone's overly-colloquial writing style).<br /><br />Other relationships highlight the story, such as that between Balboa and his son, Rocky, Jr. (Milo Ventimiglia), who has gone on to become a suit-wearing paper pusher in a wealthy Philadelphia high rise. When making a surprise visit, Balboa sees his son's boss acting belligerently, suggesting that his son is willing to let people step all over him. He clearly has some issues, always feeling as if he's lived in the shadow of his famous father. Now it seems as if Rocky, Jr. is unwilling to visit the family restaurant, opting instead to go out for drinks with his friends. During one such outing, the bar's television is tuned in to the sports channel, where a computer-simulated match between Balboa and current heavyweight champion Mason "The Line" Dixon (Antonio Tarver) is fought. Of course, the animated Balboa wins.<br /><br />But when the real Balboa hears of this "victory," thoughts of actually entering the ring one last time begin floating through his head. Consider the fact that at his restaurant, he goes from table to table, telling his guests stories about his past fights; is this not indicative of someone who still has something to prove? His son seems to think so, and the feelings only get stronger when Balboa decides to go through with it. Rocky, Jr. is initially unwilling to support his father, who he thinks will only succeed in embarrassing them both. The sports world doesn't hold out much hope, either; Balboa will be up against Dixon, who's younger, faster, and more athletic. But Balboa is determined to do what he feels is the right thing.<br /><br />Thus begins the obligatory montage training sequence, set against Bill Conte's famous score. Just like in the first film, Balboa runs through the city in a gray sweat suit. He punches sides of beef in Paulie's slaughterhouse. There are even some brief shots of him chugging a glassful of raw eggs. (I can't say whether or not this scene was written to appease fans of the original film. I suppose it doesn't really matter; if a film's plot centers on an impending boxing match, training footage is a necessary component.)<br /><br />I won't bother describing anything about the final fight scene in Las Vegas; because the entire film builds up to it, you should experience it for yourselves. I will say that, to a degree, I questioned the plausibility of it, especially in terms of Dixon's involvement. He's an undefeated champion boxer, yet he's not respected in the sports community, labeled as someone who only picks easy opponents. I also got the impression that he genuinely respects Balboa, despite offering a way for him to be defeated without embarrassment. He comes to believe that his managers are only interested in the financial success of the fight, and that made me wonder why he would actually want to be in the ring at all; such a hollowly conceived boxing match cannot be easily dismissed.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the ending of "Rocky Balboa" is appropriate. It helps that the fight scene in and of itself does not represent the soul of the film; as I said before, this is not a story about boxing. At one point, Balboa says something to effect of, "It's not about whether or not you get hit, but about how hard you can be hit and get back up." It may be a cliche statement, but there's no denying that it rings true. Is this film better than the original "Rocky"? Of course not. Nothing ever will be better than that. But is it a worthy final chapter to the film series? Absolutely.</p></body></html>

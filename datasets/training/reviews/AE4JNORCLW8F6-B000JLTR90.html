NOT predictable, Lady in the Water is a film above films, a truly 'realistic' fantasy to follow. Every character is finely developed, interesting and endearing. Comical moments, tear-jerking scenes and edge-of-your-seat suspense pulled me into this film. This has become one of my favorite movies of all time. An invigorating cinematic experience. Well-worth the watch.</p></body></html>

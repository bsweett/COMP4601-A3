<meta name="summary" content="Improbable Partners."></head><body><p>Director Michael Mann has authored many interesting, even if not outstanding, films as "The Keep" (1983), "The Last of the Mohicans" (1992) and "Ali" (2001). "Collateral" (2004) stands on par with them.<br /><br />It is an interesting and quite fast paced action movie. It has many common points with other "disparate partners'" stories as "48 Hours" (1982), "Lethal Weapon" (1987) or "Alien Nation" (1988). What's new here, is the fact that even if the couple, after surviving many dangerous issues, come to know each other well, they are barred to empathize too much. The reason is very simple one is a taxi driver and the other is a ruthless hired killer.<br /><br />The story is as follows: a taxi driver is hired by a passenger to conduct him on a five step "business raid". The problem is that the "business" of that man is murder. An accident in the first "step" uncovers the nature of the "business" and the taxi driver is coaxed at gun point to continue the infamous raid.<br /><br />Surprisingly the best actor's performance is given by Jamie Foxx as Max the taxi driver. His face shows all the internal turmoil without overacting. He confirms what he started to show in "Ali", working under the same director.<br /><br />Tom Cruise as Vincent the killer and Jada Pinkett Smith as Anne are correct but not outstanding.<br /><br />The action scenes are very well filmed and adrenalin charged.<br /><br />All in all it is a correct action film that may be enjoyed by different viewers.<br /><br />Reviewed by Max Yofre.</p></body></html>

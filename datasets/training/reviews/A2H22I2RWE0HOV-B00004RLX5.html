<meta name="summary" content="Star Trek Gets A Little Bit Funnier"></head><body><p>As time moved on for the aging crew of the Starship Enterprise and its fanbase was also growing older and more(dare I say it!) sophisticated  (on a purely geeky scale, of course) the producers decided it was time to start turning away from the sheer-fan aspect of the gene-pool and try and find other targets in the demographical arena that was middle class America.  Namely, the kiddies.  Now, what kid wanted to watch a bunch of old geezers up on the silver screen acting all sci-fi and cool?  Not many.  I was 16 when Star Trek IV came out and I gotta tell ya, another Star Trek movie wasn't high on my list of priorities unless the ticket for the theatre was hidden in the bra of a 16 year old girl.  So the old dudes started doing a lot more one-liners than before.  The surly Dr. McCoy as a regular stand-up comedian.  Spock was the naive sraight-man to most of the jokes.  It was funny.  They were making fun of things that we could relate to.<br /><br />Earth is under attack by some weird cylindrical probe which is vaporizing the oceans and blotting out the sun.  All systems have crashed in the wake of the probe's sheer power.  Earth is doomed.  In their exile on Vulcan with the recently resurrected Spock, the outlaw crew of Enterprise decide it's time to head home and face the music for their actions.  They Sabotaged another starship, disobeyed orders, and destroyed The Enterprise.  Court-martial?  Definitely.  On they way back to Earth they get the distress call. Avoid Earth at all costs!  Spock, having listened to the transmssion the probe is sending, deciphers that the message cannot be answered because it is intended for Humpback whales and they are extinct in the 24th century.  Ooops!  Back in time they head!  Earth!  1986!  San Francisco!  The calmities begin there.<br /><br />Of all the Star Trek flicks, this is probably the funniest. Not the most intriguing, certainly not the worst, either  (Search For Spock gets that award or Generations).  I prefer Wrath Of Khan.  But it is fun to watch.  Deadpan humor.  A look back at the mid-80s.  Worth a look every now and again. Nimoy directs.<br /><br />Dig It!</p></body></html>

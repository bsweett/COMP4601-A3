<meta name="summary" content="One of Tom Hank' best"></head><body><p>The movie is not your standard, &quot;Save the boy!&quot; type of flick.<p>The plot is new. There is alot happening, mostly a gangster\hitman(Tom Hanks) who is supposedly a hit for another hitman. He decides to take his son along, who we find out has a bad relationship with his father in the long run.<p>The best thing about this movie is the acting. Tom Hanks plays his part well, and we come to like him as a solemn, not so much stoic, but humble man. His son is the farmer type, as seen in the movie. His son is also a bit, well he is naive. I can't describe him in one paragraph.<p>The action is good. There are plenty of gun fights, some cars, and the occasional shoot em up action scene. But then theres the end. The movie rolls straight up a hill, and stays that way. I loved the ending as much as the middle of the movie. The beggining is good, but don't stop watching the movie till' the end.<br />Overall---&gt;5 Stars<br />  ___P??f???___</p></body></html>

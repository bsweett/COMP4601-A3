<meta name="summary" content="No masterpiece. NOT BY ALONG SHOT"></head><body><p>Maybe this film will be good in the future for those of us who need a chaser for the unearthly greatness that is HEAT. The action is first-rate, and Cruise's character is very, very interesting. But then again, so is DeNiro's. My main gripe with this film is that it had a *brilliant* premise and failed to take the characters where they needed to go, winding up in a generic shootout that could have been the end to a dozen other Hollywood films. And no, the swelling music at the end seemed almost like a mockery of Heat's epic ending. Heat = one of my favorite films. This one is ranking somewher around #300. I've got to say also, I'm just not as interested in Jamie Foxx's character. I just want to watch Cruise.</p></body></html>

Other small-time films became big phenomenons that this penguin movie still makes you fathom how it came about. Blair Witch Project and Napolean Dynamite(a vastly overrated unfunny film personally) were films that became big successes despite the lack of major promotion. Here we have a documentary of an overlooked bird that manages to make you laugh and sad without milking it.<br /><br />Narrated by Morgan Freeman, he tells the story of the emperor penguin: a bird in Antarctica who faces many dangers and perils to find a mate and create life. First it's a big migration to the nesting grounds where they all gather and meet the females. Then it's the process of finding a mate. And then they end up creating life only winter and slight accidents could provide an egg being cracked.<br /><br />Once that's done, in nature's most ironic of ironies, it's the men that tends to the egg while the females make a long trek to anywhere where they can access the sea to get fish. Then it's the long trek back to give food for the young. Then it's the male's turn to go back and feed himself who can go without food for on average 3-4 months. Babies are born and they must protect them from incredibly brutal cold.<br /><br />There's many moments where I literally laughed, probably at the overall cutesyness of it. One shot was so funny I almost had to pause the film. After the males come back they feed the young only to end up with very fat babies. Another shot has 2 penguins trying to cram into a hole big enough for one(come on, who hasn't done that with someone with a door?)<br /><br />Also some attention must be brought to Morgan Freeman's narration. His voice has this kind of statesman-like tone where anything he says must be true cause it sounds like it, while also not being so political and narrow sounding.<br /><br />It may be one of the coldest places on Earth and there's definately moments where it looks like it but living there are sure to be creatures that'll touch you.</p></body></html>

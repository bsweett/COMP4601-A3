At this point, why would anyone see a Potter film without having read the books?  It boggles the mind.  That said, this review is written toward those who know the story, proper.<br /><br />The direction was good, as was most of the writing.  Rupurt Grint was ever on pointe as Ron, and Radcliffe has without question grown his skills as Boy Who.  Watson finally acted, and without total reliance on eyebrows!  She was actually impressive in this film.  Maybe she has an acting career ahead, yet. The adult cast stepped it up in this installment, as well.  Billowy-cloaked Snape is a thing to behold, as is a broken Lucius Malfoy.  I was happy to see Carter act as if she wanted to be there, which finally brought Bellatrix alive for me.  Newcomer Rhys Ifans was wonderful.  In short, every actor delivered a standout performance.  Very impressive, in that regard.  The creatively layered reunion of the entire cast was fantastic.  That excitement alone boosts anticipation of the next film.<br /><br />I appreciate that this film was split, in order to do the story justice, as well it should have been.  I can't help but think that all of the action and luster is in the second half, which leaves this lead-up a bit diminished.  In the story proper, this portion should be the emotional setup for what is to come, and in that regard I felt it lacked.  The darkness, thus direness, of the Wizarding world was made evident from the opening scene.  This is no children's film.  Know that the racy scenes and violence reveal this throughout.  Still, even with poignant smatterings of grief and terror, the emotional depth did not sustain.  I would have gladly sat through a four-hour film if longevity would have maintained the momentum better.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br />I was a bit bereft of the treatment of Hedwig's demise.  As the film left it, her absence was the only real indicator that she was dead.  The lack of Harry's processing of that was equally unrealistic and unclear. More acknowledgement was given to the loss of Dobby, who had far less face time in the films than she did.  Though Hagrid was Harry's first real friend in the Wizarding world, Hedwig was his first real emotional connection in his life.  I didn't think it canon that this bond wouldn't have been more acknowledged at her death.<br /><br />Though the camping scenes didn't make for riveting action (the same can be said of the book), the character development during those weeks was long overdue.  We saw a darkness in Ron prior unrevealed, a depth to Hermione and Harry's relationship had only been hinted at prior, and a long-needed resourcefulness in Harry was finally tapped.  I agree with criticism that pace slowed tremendously during those scenes, but what we learned about the trio in that stillness was necessary.  In truth, it was better delivered in the film than in the book, albeit out of sequence in the film.<br /><br />Insight into what was happening at Hogwart's bore showing.  Early in the film, the impression is finally given that this is not just Harry's fight, but is that of the entire Wizarding world.  But by focusing primarily on the trio's lives and not how others contributed to the effort--and they were--much of that communal sense of obligation, thus sacrifice, is lost.<br /><br />Explanations of the Hallows was rushed at best.  If you didn't understand them or how they and their lineage relate to Harry's plight, I'm afraid rewinding won't be much help.  That said, if you know their far-reaching relevance from the book, the animated sequence telling their story was well-done, albeit quickly so.<br /><br />The cheesiest effect in the film was Ron's greatest fears come to life, seeing Harry and Hermione passionately locked together.  It looked like a 2D paste job against a rolling CGI effect.  I was so unamused by the effect that I didn't connect with what a riveting and psychological test it was for Ron.<br /><br />The best scene in the film was Harry silently summoning Hermione to dance.  Without being romantic or sentimental it was profound, showing how Harry has matured into awareness of and reaction to the emotional states of others.  This is the trait that sets Harry apart from Voldemort more than any other, and this scene subtly conveyed his finesse in interpersonal observation and reaction.<br /><br />Several vaguely explained plot items troubled me, most of which were also problematic in the previous films.  Dobby showing up with no explanation is a major oversight that did not need to be.  The Missing Mirror, which should have been introduced way back at The Order of the Phoenix and wasn't now shows up with no explanation at all.  This lack negates how instrumental it is in the escape from Malfoy Manner, and diminishes the grief that Harry still processes from Sirius', and most recently Dumbledore's death.  Along that line, the need for the horcruxes is revealed, though the significance of the items precious to each of the Houses at Hogwart's is not.  It will be interesting to see how they jam learning about them AND finding each of them into the remaining installment</p></body></html>

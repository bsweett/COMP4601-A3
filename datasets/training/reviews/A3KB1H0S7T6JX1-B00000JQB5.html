<meta name="summary" content="The Story of Imhotep and Anck Su Namun overshadows all!!!"></head><body><p>The Mummy is a WONDERFUL movie, set during the interwar period in Egypt, dealing with the adventures of an unlikely group that has banded together for a variety of reasons in exploring the lost City of the Dead-Hamunaptra.<br />The acting is very good, the costumes are extraordinary, and the plot is GREAT! The Mummy successfully combines adventure, horror, humour and romance, but what really steals the show is the "villains" who had me rooting for them throughout the whole movie.<br />There is a very strong element of archaeology and mythology; what with the lost City of the Dead, the Gold Book of Life and the Black book of death, the gods Anubis and Horus etc.<br />Deserts, Pyramids, Heroes, and Villains are all about...<br />Strongly recommended to those who are fascinated with archaeology and history, especially those with a keen interest in Ancient Egypt.  It is a definite "must see" together with the sequel The Mummy Returns, as well as the Scorpion King and Stargate, which also fall into the same category of movies, theme-wise.</p></body></html>

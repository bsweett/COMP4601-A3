I've already reviewed 'The Sixth Sense' and anyone who knows me knows that I hold that film in the highest regard, as one of the best 'ghost' films for it's smart script and excellent direction, not to mention the chemistry between Haley and Bruce.  Now I have always been a diehard Willis fan so I was excited when I first saw 'Unbreakable'.  I was expecting another 'Sixth Sense' type vibe but what I recieved was something much different.  As everyone knows, I feel that Night has done no better than 'Sixth Sense' and I fear he never will BUT 'Unbreakable' is a very close second for many reasons.<br /><br />First of all, the film is far from scary, but it has very dark tones.  The entire film is directed in dark lights with eeire music and the characters are haunted by the way their life is going.  Willis plays David Dunn a man whose struggling to make his life work.  He works as a security guard and is trapped in a marriage falling apart.  The opening scene has David on a train travelling home from a job interview and he is seated next to a beautiful woman.  Just watching his character remove his wedding band and then, almost awkwardly, proceed to put the moves on this woman says a lot.  You can see the state his character is in.<br /><br />Moments later the news is on and Davids son Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark) realizes that the train his father was on has just crashed.  Come to find out his father is the sole survivor of that crash and he hasn't even suffered a scratch.  To everyone they shrug it off as coincidence, even Davids wife (played brilliantly by Robin Wright Penn) but as time passes and a strange man (Samuel L. Jackson) who believes that David may in fact be a superhero.<br /><br />This may sound far fetched, but come on, if we'll go see 'X-Men' or 'Superman Returns' then we can get with the program.  This is just a superhero movie for adults.  But here's what makes this movie so great to me.  This is not about being a superhero as much as it is about becomeing a superhero.  This film revolves around a man not sure of who he is or what he is for that matter and his unwillingness to believe he's more than normal, but once he does realize then it all starts to make sense...for David it all starts to make sense.<br /><br />You'll see that once he starts to take responsibility for himself, knowing what he needs to do and doing something about it his whole life takes a turn for the better.  This is going on the theme that many of us are unhappy with our lives because we're unhappy or unsure of ourselves.  Once David realized who he was he knew he had purpose...much greater purpose than to be a security guard who once had dreams of something greater (we see in flashbacks that David had dreams to once be a pro-football player but due to an injury...wink/wink...he gave it all up).  Knowing he had a place made him whole, made him happy, and made him see that what he had was what he wanted.<br /><br />The entire cast is superb, Willis especially, and the story and direction is Shyamalan at his best.  Yes, since 'The Sixth Sense' Night has slipped from a lot of people's lists and has somewhat become concidered a dissapointment (I think this is mostly due to poor advertising), but when looked at properly he really is a magnificent storyteller.  The final frames will leave you breathless and will send shockwaves down your spine.  I feel it's a brilliant film with a universal message we can all appreciate and understand.</p></body></html>

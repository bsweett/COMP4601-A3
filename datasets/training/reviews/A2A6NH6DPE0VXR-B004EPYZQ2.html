What they soon realize is that something escaped from the train during the accident and the military will do anything to cover it up.<br />  Super 8 starts out exciting, becomes very slow in the middle and then is exciting again. So I never found the pacing to be too good, while the film also reminded me of way too many Spielberg movies, including E.T, War of Worlds, Close Encounters and Goonies "which he produced" among others. While the thing in it "and I won't give away what it is", isn't very original looking.<br />  I will say that the film at least works emotionally and that all of the young actors are very strong in their roles. The look of the film is also faithful to Spielberg which works since the film is basically a tribute to him. But they might as well have gave away more of the plot in the trailers since the movie really isn't too original.</p></body></html>

Fortunately, I can blame it on my wife, who did not know that this is "The Princess Diaries" meant to hit the late teen female demo. Supposedly there is a book more sophisticated than the movie with the same title... I'd go so far as to say that the Olsen twins have probably made movies with more depth than this.<br /><br />This is one the longest 2,467 hours you will spend watching a film.</p></body></html>

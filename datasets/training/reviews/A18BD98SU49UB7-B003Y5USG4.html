Plus it is the only Natural Disaster film that I can stand! If you want a killer of a film that you wanna test on your sound system, this is the one! Storm chasing galore, and an internal story between the characters that allows you to make your own assumptions. It's refreshing, and covered in good, old, swirling dirt! Moo, baby!</p></body></html>

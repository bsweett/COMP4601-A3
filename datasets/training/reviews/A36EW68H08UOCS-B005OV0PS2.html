<meta name="summary" content="The Coen Brothers Strike Again"></head><body><p>This movie begins with a meandering voiceover by Sam Elliot that wanders around in several different directions before he pauses to admit that he has lost his place and forgot what the hell he was talking about...<br /><br />The script wanders about too, but it's a good trip.  The script is a Coen Brother's specialty, with characters who are not very smart, or at least not nearly as smart as they think they are.  Jeff Bridges plays "The Dude", a likeable loser of a Californian who unfortunately shares the same last name as "The Big Lebowski", a wealthy older man with a trophy ex-porn star wife who owes bad characters money.  The Dude's chief social activity consists of drinking White Russians, being stoned, and hanging out with his bowling team.  The Dude's team includes John Goodman as a Vietnam Vet who doesn't think twice about trying to double-cross criminals to make off with a million bucks of ransom money, or pulling a gun on a rival bowler who makes a minor infraction, stepping across the line during league play.  Steve Buscemi is on the team as well.  It has been noted that another Coen trademark is bizarre manners of death for Buscemi characters.<br /><br />To try to describe the plot would meander worse than Sam Elliot's opening narration, but by the end Sam shows up in person (looking great as usual beneath a cowboy hat) to tell the Dude that he likes his style.<br /><br />The Dude abides, and I like the Coen's style. A lot.</p></body></html>

Other scenes drew laughs that were the type that make you feel guilty for laughing.  Other parts of the movie were simply disgusting.  After reading some of the reviews, it is clear that there is no middle ground when it comes to this movie.  Some want to put it on a pedestal as a brilliant political comedy that pokes fun at America, while others simply lambast it.  I am taking the middle road here.  The movie is funny to watch, with some parts that make you cringe and feel uncomfortable even as an innocent observer.<br /><br />The most troubling aspects of this movie dealt with the sheer mean-spiritedness that some of the scenes featured.  For example, a very sweet jewish couple that ran the bed and breakfast.  Whether or not Cohen is Jewish, the way those people were treated showed little class.  If they were part of the joke, I would not be so disgusted; but I don't think they were.<br /><br />The fight between Cohen and his partner in which they were rolling around nude, served no point other than sick shock value.  How that scene, or the bathroom/dinner table scene serves as political commentary is beyond me.  There is no reason to make this movei more than it is.  It is a slapstick, low brow, comedy with some funny scenes and other scenes that are simply gross and geared towards the type of drunken college kids in the R.V. that Borat got drunk with.<br /><br />Three stars.  Not recommended for family viewing at all, but could be perfect for a drunken poker party.</p></body></html>

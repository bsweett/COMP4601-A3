Sure, there are action scenes (albeit a few).  But, the first of the Trek movies isn't that good.  Don't get me wrong.  I think the cast did a pretty good job.  It's the story that is boring.  Not to mention that 10-minute blackness of music at the beginning..I found that boring.  This movie has been a mixed bag for Trekkies.<br /><br />  This movie also stars Stephen Collins from "7th Heaven".</p></body></html>

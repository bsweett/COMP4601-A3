It is set in a place I didn't even know existed - Roosevelt Island in the middle of the Hudson River, just a short ski-lift-like "tram" ride from Manhattan proper. This location, so near and yet so far from the normal workaday world, sets the tone of the movie beautifully.<br /><br />The acting is excellent throughout. Pete Postlethwaite is especially good as the building maintenance man - who may or may not be dangerous. Ariel Gade, the prescient little girl, really made the film for me though. She had an unusual core of wise adult quietude about her that gave her a sensitivity to her new atmosphere. She wasn't the average modern child, distracted with constant trivial wantings and whinings. So she brought a Victorian, 'Turn of the Screw' supernatural intensity to her role.<br /><br />The most unrealistic element of the plot though was the behavior of Jennifer Connelly's attorney. He was actually available to her and sympathetic to her case. Where do you find lawyers like that? I can never even get my lawyer on the phone.</p></body></html>

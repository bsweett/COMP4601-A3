<meta name="summary" content="Great first Dramatic effort by Tim Meadows..."></head><body><p>Wow!  Just wow!  I am impressed with this one.  I was certainly surprised and a bit skeptical when I first heard about this one, seeing how I normally associate Tim Meadows, with flat, not very funny, comedies, when he stars, and very vague cameo and side roles in other Adam Sandler and Will Ferrel main Headliner movies!<br /><br />But this one, wow! He is really a talented individual!<br /><br />I shouldn't be so quick to judge though.  His role in Boogie Nights, also featured some wonderful comedic actors by Mr. Meadows, and he was the comic relief of that movie, featuring Marky Mark.<br /><br />I also like how this movie, once again paired up Nick Nolte and Mr. Meadows, for the first time since 48 Hours!  Nothing short of brilliance, I say!  While Mr. Meadow's role was much more dramatic in Hotel Rwanda, keep in mind, he did show a sufficient amount of that "angry black" character he is famous for in 48 Hours.<br /><br />Definitely pick up this movie!  You won't be sorry!<br /><br />MC White said:  You'd have to be crazy not to pick this movie up, and memorize all of the Main Character's names!  TWO THUMBS WAY UP!!!</p></body></html>

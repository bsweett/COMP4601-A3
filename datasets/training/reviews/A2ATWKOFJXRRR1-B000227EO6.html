<meta name="summary" content="Doesn't Come Close to Volume One"></head><body><p>I was a great lover of Kill Bill Volume One.  I saw it in the theater with a buddy of mine, then forced my girlfriend to watch it when it came out on DVD.  She enjoyed it enough to accompany me to the theater last weekend and watch Volume Two.  I wish we hadn't gone now . . . <p>The thing that was so appealing about Volume One was how it made fun of films of old: excessive bloody violence (literally spraying gallons of crimson across the screen), corny music overlays, ridiculously impossible fight sequences, and a very old plot (revenge).  I absolutely loved the fact that an informed movie-goer could laugh at the gore spilling across the screen because it was meant to be that way.  Dark comedy some might call it, but it was actually a parody of sorts.  I was expecting something similar (maybe even more tantalizing) in Volume 2.  But it was not to be.<p>Gone were the extended and entertaining fight scenes, revenge took a back seat to back story (the showing of Bill coming to The Bride's wedding and the ensuing slaughter witnessed at the beginning of Volume One, The Bride's training at the hands of a Kung Fu master, etc.), and the absence of such important items as The Bride's list of people left to kill.  <p>The music, that was so impressive in Volume One, seems to have lost its "volume" in this second release also.  It was hardly noticeable.  Whereas in Volume One, it was paramount to the story as a whole.  <p>Although I love good dialogue (and there was some in this film, make no doubt about that), I don't care to have the film maker TELL ME EVERYTHING by having their characters explain all their motivations.  That ruined this film for me.  <p>Now there were interesting aspects to this film, however.  Most notably was the burial and escape of The Bride, and the dialogue of Darryl Hannah after she has a deadly snake bite someone.<p>I will give the film credit for not being formulaic, too.  I'm beginning to hate that about Hollywood.  This could've gotten overly-smaltzy at the end, but it wasn't.  The Bride's revenge will not be quenched until she kills Bill.<p>With the entrance of The Bride's unknown child (which we ALL knew would happen after viewing Volume One), it bordered on smaltziness.  It teetered on the line...but didn't go over. THANK GOD!<p>C+ rating.</p></body></html>

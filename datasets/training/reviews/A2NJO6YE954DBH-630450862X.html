(Then it got worse)"></head><body><p>You can make an argument that the most horrific moment in "Carrie" comes in the beginning when Carrie White (Sissy Spacek in an Oscar nominated performance) is in the shower of the girl's locker room at Bates High School and gets her period for the first time.  Carrie is so ignorant about her own body that she has no clue as to what is happening and thinks that she is bleeding to death.  Her classmates have no way of knowing that because they have largely ignored Carrie her entire life, but their reaction is that of a pack of vicious wolves attacking a wounded fawn.  We do not need to know anything about Carrie in order to have sympathy for her and to despise her attacks.  But Stephen King's story ups the ante because one of the young girls, Sue Snell (Amy Irving) has an attack of conscience, which makes the rest look even worse, although Chris Hargensen (Nancy Allen), an original "mean girl," does not need such help.<br /><br />Certainly female viewers are going to respond viscerally to this opening scene.  Like the unforgettable scenes in "Psycho" and "Jaws" it is about something horrible happening when you are naked and vulnerable.  But it is also comparable to the chest buster scene in "Alien" in that the initial attack is internal.  That there are so many common elements between these classic horror scenes undoubtedly speaks to something significant, but we will save that for another day.<br /><br />Another key element of the horror story is that Sue tries to make amends.  Some find her decision to punish herself by making Tommy (William Katt), the boy she loves, take Carrie to the Prom to be somewhat unbelievable, but it works in this film because of the look on Amy Irving's face when Miss Collins (Betty Buckley) reads the riot act to the girls and Sue finally gets the depth of the wretchedness of their act.  Besides, their prom tickets are in danger at that point and throwing something away before it can be taken from you is a teenage art form (one that I mastered and used early and often).  This also adds an additional level to the horror because not only does Carrie's pink prom dress get ruined by all that pig's blood, so does Sue's act of contrition.<br /><br />This attempt by Sue establishes a contrast with the way that Carrie's mother, Margaret (Piper Laurie in another Oscar nominated performance), treats her own daughter.  A religious fanatic warped beyond the limits of caricature, Margaret is a monumentally abusing mother who wraps her attacks in the language of righteousness.  Ironically, her treatment of her daughter is a twisted example of an act of contrition, as Margaret seeks to atone for what she considers to be a sin.<br /><br />There is a blatant link between the blood of the shower scene and the shower of blood at the prom in that each serves as a catalyst for Carrie's telekinesis.  The first time it is for her powers to become active, as she learns when for the first time in her life the dirty look she gives to someone making fun of her are no longer impotent gestures.  At the prom this becomes the dam bursting, and what is key is not simply the image of the blood drenched Carrie but the wide-eyed look that Spacek gives us in one of the create close-ups in horror movie history.  Her attackers have gone too far and there is a juvenile sense of justice to the fact that she responds in kind.  You know that a lot of innocent kids die in that gym that night, but silence assumes assent and it can be argued that they are culpable to some degree with making Carrie's life so miserable.<br /><br />But we are so invested in Carrie as a character that the bloody climax of this 1976 film produces mixed feelings.  She gets to pay back her tormenters, an idea that virtually all high school students can relate to, but she goes too far, another inherent trait of the teenage psyche.  It is wonderful and horrible at one and the same time.  But when Carrie claims her final victim our sympathies are engaged again because the tragedy here is that what happened is not her fault.  Carrie White is culpable for her crimes, but the primary responsibility is not her own and the final justice of the film is that the person who is most responsible pays.  However, the final image is of another teenage girl damned for all time because of forces beyond her own control and the idea that no good deed goes unpunished is a rather horrifying final point for the movie to make.<br /><br />Granted, this is not a flawless horror film.  Director Brian De Palma has too much fun with the camera at times, as he is wont to do, such as when he over does the split screens during the gymnasium scene.  What works well to indicate that Carrie is using her powers to slam shut the doors works well, but then it just because too much.  Then again, the boys dressing up for the prom is a nice bit of levity before things go to hell, and filming in reverse Sue Snell's walk to visit Carrie's final resting place is a nice subtle effect.  Whatever failings the film has, such as Laurie's way over-the-top performance and the forced symbolism of her character's crucifixion, the best moments in "Carrie" are some of the most memorable in the history of horror films.  There are just too many body punches in this one to justify rounding down.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A quick, sloppy cash in for the novice director"></head><body><p>Upon the anticipation of one of my favorite holidays, I felt it was necessary, if not crucial to dabble in some suspenseful and horrifying cinema this week. The suspense, or lack thereof, mostly resulted into a depressing and horrific cinematic experience. It was so horrifying to see a remake fail in all aspects, visually and cinematically that I could almost hear John Carpenter's hair turn whiter as he chain-smokes his last and final cigarette.<br /><br />The truth is I happen to be a fan of Rob Zombie's previous films; moreover, I appreciated his passion for cult horror movies that sometimes incorporated the sort of nostalgic drive-in movie era. Upon hearing a remake of Carpenter's classic, I became annoyed and disappointed at first, but was soon relieved to find out it was someone not only worthy of creativity but truly passionate about these type of slasher films that Zombie cares about so much. Boy, was I profoundly disappointed in Zombie's "re-imaging" of Halloween, or shall I call it a sheer massacre.<br /><br />For the first 45-50 minutes of the film, We get a lengthy and interminable back round of Michael's Myer's psychology; the rationale; he comes from a broken home with a mother who strips late night to make ends meet, a dead-beat father figure who incessantly call his boy, "faget", and an uncaring older sister who is about as uninteresting as the film. At school, it is no different as Michael endures a myriad of tortures from school bullies who appear about as non-threatening as a senile old lady. The young boy playing Michael Myer's childhood was disturbing in the sense that he was scarier looking without the mask as his girlish blonde hair, pre-adolescent chubby face and crooked teeth rendered him retarded looking. The bottom line is that Rob Zombie's approach into making Michael Myer's character more sympathetic to the audience truly defies John Carpenter's intentions. I honestly loathed the weak climatic build up of Michael Myer's mental breakdown if you could call it that; personally it looked like a rebellious pre-pubescent hissy fit. It was a tough pill to swallow to take Myer's childhood seriously and even more so when he's battering his sister's boyfriend brains with a baseball bat, or slitting William Forsythe's throat. Even Malcolm Mcdowell's psychological evaluation of Michael Myer's meltdown in the mental institution came off as incredibly corny adding entirely no substance to the film; it was uninformative and just plain boring. I just hope they paid Mcdowell a pretty penny to waste his valuable acting skills on this film, but that is beside the point.<br /><br />After the long introduction horror fans of the genre finally get to see the true modern Michael Myer's we've been waiting for, the result, a 280 lb. 6'8 gorilla. Hey who would of thought Michael Meyer's physique would mimic an NFL coaches wet dream. This is another problem I had with this film, Rob Zombie thought it was necessary to seriously upgrade Myer's physique, bad idea... what were they feeding this kid at the mental institution, HGH and testosterone! His figure looks overbearing in the film to the point where his on-screen presence looks inhuman and far too dominating as his broad shoulders and towering height look more like a Caterpillar bulldozer at a construction site. In all seriousness, I had difficulty deciphering whether Myer's was suffering from middle-child syndrome or exhibiting symptoms of roid rage, which is probably the only mysterious enigma about Myer's Psychology in the entire film. Personally, I thought what made Carpenter's Myer's more frightening is that he appeared more average and less animated. It was his slow but persevering amble that gave me the chills, not a fast over dominating beast that broke through every door and main beam in that house. It was ridiculous and nauseating to witness Zombie's over extended chase scenes that really amounted to sheer emptiness and dissatisfaction in the end. In other words, the pay-off sucked big time. The editing overall was pretty weak as well, a few interesting wide-angle shots in the mental institution accompanied by more mundane uninteresting chase scenes. Rob Zombie also upgrades the violence as well but it fails miserably to compensate for the lack of suspense. As a result, the violence comes off as incredibly gratuitous and unwarranted. However, I cannot bash the nudity even though it delivered the same unjustified result as the violence. It was almost as if Robb Zombie was forcing the nudity as if saying, "I can show bush in my Halloween and get away with it".<br /><br />Despite my criticism, there are some few and sparse redeeming qualities such as the authenticity of recapturing the 1970's feel which Rob Zombie subtlety recaptures and manages to weave into the film. Sheri Moon Zombie actually pulls it off kind of nicely, maybe it was her carefully selected wardrobe or her soft dirty blonde hair, couldn't tell you but her looks worked for the time being. Her acting is another story, I won't go there, but I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and say its serviceable at best. Rob Zombie throws in some 70's one hit wonders, some Blue oyster Cult, which is also featured in Carpenter's version when Jamie Lee Curtis is driving with PJ Soles, Rush and Nazareth. The only interesting relationship I found was that between Dr. Loomis and Michael Myers in the mental institution and Sid Haig's quick cameo, other than that the character development was extremely weak leaving me disconnected from relating to anybody.<br /> I did get through most of the bonus features and even some of that 4 ? hour documentary. There are some interesting bonus features, just about enough to last you through next Halloween. Horror Fans will enjoy the 2nd disc with interviews and behind the scenes, along with a 3rd disc step by step "making of documentary of the entire movie. Despite Rob Zombie's catastrophic reimaging of a Horror classic, I have to applaud his audaciousness for actually exposing how he screwed up a classic in the infamous 4 ? documentary. But seriously, it is interesting to see how a film is made and how frustrating it is to meet deadlines, deal with actors, prop sets you name it. There is a great deal patience and articulation in respect to guiding your actors, script and photography.  The film is certainly not a good remake, more like horrendous but the bonus features can keep you occupied for a bit if your interested in making films.</p></body></html>

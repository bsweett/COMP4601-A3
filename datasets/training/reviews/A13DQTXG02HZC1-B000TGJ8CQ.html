<meta name="summary" content="Don't know what to make of it"></head><body><p>The story premise is simple enough, a small-time magician is born with a gift to see into the future albeit two minutes of it to change his life. By accident, his gift is spotted by the Government Agency, which intends to use that as an avenue to track down the whereabouts of the nuclear bombs planted in LA before it's too late.  Furthermore, the terrorists also hunts for him because they want Nicholas' character to be shot before their whereabout is revealed.  As the saying goes, I would be buggered if I do & I would be buggered if I don't.  Thus, Nicholas needs to be a step ahead of them until he comes across Jessica's character that he's enamoured to.  Then, everything become personal.  There are odd light hearted moments such as Nicholas considering his chances of breaking ice with Jesicca's character.  This is an okay movie rather than great because even after the movie concludes, it's actually suggesting more permutations of the future.  The special effects is so-so where we could see what's real and what's not.  Commendable watching for watching's sake.</p></body></html>

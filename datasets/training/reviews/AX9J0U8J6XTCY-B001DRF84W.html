<meta name="summary" content="brilliant epic-an instant classic!"></head><body><p>being handicapped, and no longer able to go to the theatre, i purchased this dvd yesterday. based solely on the reputation of director ang lee, i never expected such a brilliant film, with such emotion, deep feelings, a great study in science and biology! i was astounded by the acting, the split camera work to let us see everyone's reactions as to what is taking place around them! the darn desert scene alone was worth more than the price of the dvd by it self! incredible work that has taken a beating by both most critics and theatregoers (here) alike! i blame universal's marketing strategy! this should have been a winter release where a more sophisticated audience would have really gotten into it! i feel, in years to come, ang lee's masterpiece will be a benchmark on how to really make an epic--with brains!  if you have not yet seen it-run out and get it! if you have, watch it again-the 2nd time is even better.</p></body></html>

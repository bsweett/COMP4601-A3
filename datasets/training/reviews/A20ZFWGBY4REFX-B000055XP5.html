<meta name="summary" content="Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman are incredible!"></head><body><p>When I saw "X-Men" at the theater in the summer of 2000, I was quite surprised for the hard work that director Bryan Singer ("The Usual Suspects") has put into this movie. Singer did not just a good job, but an outstanding job with the special effects and the storytelling and such. As far as the acting goes, Patrick Stewart ("Star Trek: The Next Generation") was an excellent choice as Professor Xavier. In fact, I knew that they would pick Stewart for this role. And as for Hugh Jackman (who appeared in 1998's "Paperback Hero" prior to doing "X-Men") as Logan/Wolverine, Jackman was brilliant! We all know that Hugh Jackman is from Australia, and that "X-Men" was his first American production. But when Jackman gets right down to talking in that American accent, he does it with perfection all the way! And that is what makes Jackman the actor that he is today, with lots of charisma and style as well. The supporting cast, including Ian McKellen (Magneto), Halle Berry (Storm), Famke Janssen (Jean Grey), James Marsden (Cyclops), Anna Paquin (Rogue), Rebecca Romjin-Stamos (Mystique), Tyler Mane (Sabertooth), and Ray Park (Toad) gave great performances as well! The DVD transfer of this was simply amazing! Especially with features like Hugh Jackman's screen test, deleted scenes, trailers, TV spots, behind the scenes footage, and much more! "X-Men" is the best comic book adaption ever made since "Superman" and "Batman"! I cannot wait for the "X-Men" sequels to come out! But until that time comes, I will still enjoy watching "X-Men" for years to come.</p></body></html>

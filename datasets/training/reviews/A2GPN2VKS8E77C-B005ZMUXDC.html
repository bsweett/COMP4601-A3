<meta name="summary" content="Walt Disney Pictures Strikes A Goldmine With Their 50th Animated Motion Picture."></head><body><p>Note: A friend of mine got the movie for me as a bootleg copy 1 day after it came out on DVD (though I was expecting the actual DVD).<br /><br />Disney has not lost its magic touch. They've been making quality, family-friendly movies since 1937 and still going strong. View it in 3-D. It's so worth it.<br /><br />The movie begins with a clip of Mickey Mouse in "Steamboat Willie" then the camera pans back to show Mickey in the 0 for "Walt Disney's 50th Animated Feature." Very good reference to the past.<br /><br />The story is based on the fairy tale "Rapunzel" by the Brothers Grimm, and the film was originally titled "Rapunzel" but changed by the studio to lure boys in. Not a bad move, marketing-wise, but Disney should have kept the original title.<br /><br />Biblically-speaking, there is no swearing or sex (it's A DISNEY movie, people!! What would you expect other than singing, dancing, good old-fashioned fun and clean humor?). There is some mild violence, but it's handled discreetly, and it's usually comic (though there are some frightening scenes for little ones). ***BEGIN SPOILER*** One scene towards the end is adapted straight from the fairy tale, in which Rapunzel heals the Prince through her tears and his sight is restored (after he's blinded by falling into thorn bushes while jumping from the tower in rage at not finding Rapunzel there). Obviously, Disney changed it a bit to make it more family-friendly, but still, parents should still be there to reassure their little ones, AND never does the movie pretend to be anything more than a fairy tale (ie. "The Little Mermaid," "Aladdin," "Beauty And The Beast," etc).<br />***END SPOILER***<br /><br />Alan Menken, the Academy Award winning composer of "The Little Mermaid," "Aladdin" and "Beauty And The Beast," wrote the songs for the film. My personal favourite song is "I See The Light"; a very heartwarming and romantic ballad that conjures up the ballroom scene from "Beauty And The Beast." All the songs, though, are equally enchanting and fun. Pascal reminds me of a certain Caribbean crab. This film is reminiscent of the Disney films we know and love. I highly recommend it; the perfect film either for a date night, a family movie night or just for your own  entertainment. The casting and production values are simply amazing, just what you would expect from a top-notch Disney production. The soundtrack is also Tangamazing. Rated PG for mild violence.</p></body></html>

Andy (Hoffmann) is a real estate accountant who needs money to feed his secret heroin addiction, while Hank (Hawke) is a doting dad who is already three months behind on his alimony and child-support payments.  Hank, the "weakling," is initially reluctant to turn to a life of crime to solve his problems, but desperation and the persuasive powers of his domineering older sibling finally convince him to do it.<br /><br />"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" is the latest work by veteran director Sidney Lumet, who in his prime gave us "Twelve Angry Men," "The Pawnbroker," "Dog Day Afternoon," "Network," and "The Verdict," and who here demonstrates that, even in this his sixth decade of moviemaking, he is still at the top of his game.  In his most famous - invariably urban-based - dramas, Lumet has always been far more concerned with character study than with plot mechanics per se - even when, as is certainly the case here, the film boasts one of the most purely fascinating storylines of any movie in recent memory.  For, indeed, with every twist and turn of the narrative, Lumet and screenwriter Kelly Masterson reveal new and fascinating aspects of the characters, as we watch the brothers becoming ever more entangled in a web of their own making, till, finally, no good options are left.  To draw us deeper into the plight of the characters and the world they have created for themselves, the filmmakers have come up with a demanding and complex - but always comprehensible - multi-level time structure through which to tell their story, creating a fascinating puzzle for the audience to solve.<br /><br />Thanks to brilliant performances by Hoffmann, Hawke and Albert Finney as the boys' father, the movie evolves into a gripping family drama in which feelings and resentments, simmering just beneath the surface for decades, are suddenly brought to the fore by the heavy-handed machinations of Fate.<br /><br />"Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" has all the earmarks of a classic tragedy, with one glaring exception:  Andy and Hank demonstrate little of the potential nobility whose fall we would normally be called upon to mourn.  This makes the movie a true product and reflection of the times in which we live.<br /><br />First-rate on every level, "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" stands as one of the top movie releases of 2007.</p></body></html>

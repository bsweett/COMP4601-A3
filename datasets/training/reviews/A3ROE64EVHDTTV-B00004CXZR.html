<meta name="summary" content="It's a Trek"></head><body><p>The Good Things<br />*Neat special effects.  Lots of cool models and lots of interesting imagery.<br />*Interesting story.<br />*Even though the characters seemed dull at first, they are all right.<br />*Good music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Very long and slow.  It resembles "2001:  A Space Odyssey" more than "Star Trek."<br />*Decker and the bald girl (and possibly Spock) serve as the main characters, while Kirk and everybody else is subdued.<br />*Some inconsistencies with the rest of the franchise (like their God-awful uniforms...).<br /><br />This film is mildly interesting, but hardly does justice to the "Star Trek" universe.  It is probably better to see this as a different, original space opera than as a "Star Trek" film.</p></body></html>

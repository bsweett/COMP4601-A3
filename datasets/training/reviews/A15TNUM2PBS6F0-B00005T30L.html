<meta name="summary" content="Birch deserves the Oscar"></head><body><p>Ghost World is certainly not a "blockbuster" by any means.  It's was a comic book first, and the movie is very different.  I thought that both the book and movie were very good.  But they have their differences, such as some characters were taken out of the movie, and replaced with different ones.<br />Steven Buscemi's character was based on a comic one, but is basically new.  He also directs the movie.<br />The movie is basically about Enid, played to perfection by Thora Birch, but it starts off at high school graduation.  Then Enid and her friend, Rebecca, spend the summer contemplating what they want to do with the rest of their lives.<br />The movie is funny, and a refreshing change from the ... that has come out this year.  It certainly isn't totally uplifting.  It is Thora Birch who really makes this film worthwhile.  She is so great in this.  It's as if this role was made for her.<br />The characters in the movie are all great, and very entertaining.  This is for that day you say to yourself: I'm tired of all that's out there in the movies, and want something different.<br />I promise you won't be disappointed.  Oh, and stick around til the credits stop rolling.  There's a hysterically funny outtake.</p></body></html>

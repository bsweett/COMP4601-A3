<meta name="summary" content="Doesn't meet expectations"></head><body><p>Anyone expecting a replay of Darabont's masterful interpretation of Stephen King's 'The Shawshank Redemption' would definitely be disappointed here.  Quite frankly, this is much more a Hollywood movie than Darabont's last.  The movie, also based on a Stephen King story, will test your patience with its length and although good in its own way, it never truly inspires.  Set in the Great Depression the story has Michael Clarke Duncan as a man sent to The Green Mile (the green walkway that leads to the electric chair) for the murders of two little girls.  Prison warden Hanks quickly discovers however, that things aren't what they seem when the soft-spoken prisoner heals him of an infection.<p>There's a lot to say in this movie's favour.  As usual Hanks's good guy is never less than satisfactory, and Michael Clarke Duncan manages to bring a sense of emotion to his role.  Most impressive however are the electric chair scenes, which are shocking just as much as they are compelling.  Quite simply there has never been a more graphic movie against the death penalty.  There's also a nice little subplot with a malicious prison guard that likes to take out his own inadequacies on the prisoners.<p>Still, there is a definite tendancy to sentimentalise and the theme of friendship and human worth is always pushed that little bit too far.  In addition, there are several elements, such as a cutesy pet mouse, that were completely unnecesary to the story's flow and the conclusion is hurried and overly tearful.  However, that isn't to say that it's a bad movie.  Far from it, there's a lot of worth here, but it's just as conventional as every other Hollywood prison movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the Best Movies of 2003"></head><body><p>"House of Sand and Fog" sounds like it would be a haunted house movie with ghosts and zombies, but it's a very deep drama that pulls you in and doesn't let go. Kathy (goddess Jennifer Connelly) was a recovering alcoholic whose house was evicted since she didn't pay her taxes. If only she checked her mail! Behrani (Ben Kingsley) was an Iranian colonel who fled to America in search of a better life for his family. With so many opportunities in the United States, the ex-colonel struggled with his road construction and sales clerk jobs. Since Kathy's house was evicted, it went up for auction and Behrani purchased the home for a low price. Thinking that the new bungalow with its ocean view would be a great place to start again, Kathy fights to regain her home. Once a bird flies away, there is no more life. The movie is very powerful and you really can't choose a side. They both NEED the home. For real, this movie will leave you shocked and it will surprise you. I truly believe it was robbed of numerous award nominations. It is extremely powerful and it's one of the best movies I've seen.</p></body></html>

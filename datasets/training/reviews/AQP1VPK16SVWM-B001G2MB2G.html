When it comes to adapting a book into a movie, it's difficult to know what to cut and keep in. For "Harry Potter and the Order of The Phoenix" directed David Yates has streamlined Rowling's book in favor of the main plot. While it is missing some of the character of Rowling's book, it makes up for it with non-stop action and terrific acting particularly from Daniel Ratcliffe who has really blossomed as an actor in this film. Yates and the screenwriter Michael Goldenberg ("Contact", "Peter Pan")manage to condense a thick novel into a shorter, action packed sequel. That means they sometimes have to introduce characters on the fly without much background on them but the performances by the actors help fill us in a bit as well as their actions on screen.<br /><br />Video & Audio:<br /><br />As if by magic we get a sharp, crisp and colorful transfer. Featuring moody cinematography (unlike the candy floss cinematography of the first two Potter films) "Phoenix" captures the mood of the novel quite well.<br /><br />You can hear all those spells with all their detail intact as the 5.1 mix makes nice use of the format putting effects around the various speakers as necessary. This is the second film liberated from John Williams' too cutesy themes (I love Williams but his score did not work well for the "Potter" films) and has one of the best scores as well. Nicholas Hooper's score sounds marvelous in its presentation here.<br /><br />Extras:<br /><br />"Phoenix" is a bit light in the special features department. Well, that's not totally true, it's just that the special features aren't all that...special. We get 10 minutes of scenes that were cut from the film. Sometimes these are bits and pieces that just didn't fit into the film (and they didn't) other times they are extensions of scenes already in the film but cut for good reason (they overstayed their welcome).<br /><br />"Trailing Tonks" features actress Natalia Tena (who plays Nymphadora Tonks in the film hence the title) giving us a tour of the studios and the sets.<br /><br />"Harry Potter and the Magic of Editing" is short and to the point. Director Yates and editor Mark Day discuss how only minor edits can alter the pacing and feel of a film and gives us some brief examples.<br /><br />I've saved the biggest but not necessarily the best for last. "The Hidden Secrets of Harry Potter" is an Electronic Press Kit in everything but name only. It's not bad it just could have gone more into depth about the challenges of condensing one of the bigger Potter books, reception from fans to the changes, etc.<br /><br />Fans may not be happy with the abridged version in the shortest Potter film yet but I found this to be entertaining and in the spirit of Rowling's book. I try never to compare books to films simply because one can handle multiple narratives while the other handles imaginative action better. Highly recommended even though the extras are a bit on the weak side and hey, it's the movie that matters after all. Just be aware that there will probably be a double dip somewhere down the line.</p></body></html>

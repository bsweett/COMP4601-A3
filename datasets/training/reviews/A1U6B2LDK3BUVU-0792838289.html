<meta name="summary" content="Very dramatic, great finish, but illogical"></head><body><p>This is a very good movie with great suspense.  The climactic scene was a shocker.  You really should see this movie.<br /><br />Younger viewers may not be familiar with the McCarthy Era in American politics.  Shortly after World War Two ended, Senator Joseph McCarthy went on a witch hunt for communists in American government and media.  The U.S. became paranoid about communists.  It was a very odd occurrence because the communist Russians had just been our greatest allies in the war.  The whole political situation was unbelievable and rather sick.  But it was understandable because friendly Russian bear Josef Stalin was in fact a nut job not to be trusted.<br /><br />This movie gives us a senator to play the part of Joe McCarthy, commie hunter.  The movie makes him a fool, which is very appropriate because he was one, a nattering imbecile.  The movie does an excellent job of portraying him.<br /><br />However, that is where the movie departs from reality.  Yes, Joe McCarthy was an imbecile and a liar, but he did not have a dragon lady for a wife.  In this movie, it is his wife, played by Angela Lansbury, who is the villain of the piece.  She is pulling his strings, and pulling a lot of other strings besides.<br /><br />Her son is a decorated war hero, but his medal was given under false pretenses.  He was not actually a war hero.  He and his entire company were hypnotized and brainwashed by the Russians and Koreans into believing that he was a war hero, when in fact his company was simply captured, flown to Russia, and brainwashed.  The hero murdered two of his own soldiers, at the demand of his capturers, and under hypnosis.<br /><br />One of the best scenes of the movie is when we see the soldiers under hypnosis, acting calm, unaware that they are the object of a demonstration, thinking they are at a ladies horticulture meeting.<br /><br />The war hero returns home to carry out the assassination of a presidential candidate, in order to clear the way for Angela Lansbury's idiot husband (Joseph McCarthy) to move up from VP candidate to presidential candidate.<br /><br />And he is to do it under hypnosis.<br /><br />And his own mother is the American operative in charge of the operation.  Despite the fact that her husband is a commie hunter, she is a communist agent plotting the assassination of an American politician, and using her own son as the killer.<br /><br />I realize that the plot is unbelievable.  It is, and that is a weakness of the story.  The story line is harder to believe than Noah and the ark.  Her own son was used as the killer, without her consent?  What kind of nonsense is that?<br /><br />And what exactly are her plans?  She says that she plans to get even with the communists for using her own son in this project.  Excuse me?  Then why does she cooperate with the project in the first place?<br /><br />Despite the illogical story development and the unreasonable nature of so many of the details, it is still a gripping story with a terrific ending.  There is nothing wrong with Sinatra's acting either, though his character is a bit of a moron for allowing the war hero to disappear for a honeymoon at the crucial time (I couldn't believe what I was seeing when Sinatra allowed the killer to enjoy his honeymoon, putting the entire plot on hold, and leading to tragedy), and for failing to put him on surveillance 24/7 once it was known that he was a hypnotized killer waiting to strike.  Sinatra's character was the most inept G-man I ever heard of, but that's not the actor's fault, it is the writer's.<br /><br />I read other reviews on this site and I see that they all overrated this unrealistic movie.  But it is a very good one because of the suspense and the great ending, despite the fact that it has some very serious flaws as mentioned above.  The biggest flaw is that Angela Lansbury hates the Russians but is still working for them, with the ultimate goal of destroying them, yet willing to assassinate a presidential candidate for the hated Russians.  That whole piece of illogic makes me stop taking the writing seriously.  Whatever, it is a good action flick.<br /><br />The fact that Sinatra, alone, was racing up the stairs to stop a political assassination is pretty dopy.  Why didn't he have a few dozen people on his staff, communicating via walkie talkie, who could have helped him out?  He was an irresponsible idiot every step of the way, though the results are what counts.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="WHAT AN EXTENSIVE LIST OF REALLY GREAT ACTORS. GREAT DIRECTOR. SO WHY WAS IT HARD TO STAY AWAKE FOR ABOUT HALF OF THE MOVIE"></head><body><p>Mostly, I was disappointed with the slow pace of much of this movie. Somehow, I feel it had the potential to be really good, BUT IT WASN'T. I was bored through about half of it. It's a cop/robber movie that drifted in and out, sometimes thinking it was a socio drama. The melding of these two genres didn't work. TOO BAD!</p></body></html>

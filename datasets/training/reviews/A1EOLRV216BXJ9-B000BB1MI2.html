<meta name="summary" content="An eye-catcher - thoughtful and well-scripted"></head><body><p>By creating a beautifully crafted town with a mysterious chocolate factory at one end of the town and the struggling Bucket family living in a shabby, tilted and weather beaten house at the other end, the audience was treated to a wonderful journey.<br /><br />The chocolate bar making at the factory in the opening credits was a great animation sequence, especially the wrapping of the bars by the robotic hands. Don't enter the cinema late!<br /><br />While the Bucket family was deprived from food and material comforts, it was more than made up for by the love and attention among the son, parents and 4 grandparents. Charlie's quest for one of the five golden tickets to the chocolate factory was never smooth and easy. His heart (so did the audience's) sank lower each time the news announced another ticket found elsewhere and he himself unwrapped another ticketless bar. The atmosphere was intense when Charlie's grandparent sent him to buy one more bar with his own last coin. When the screen darkened as the grandfather closed his eyes, the audience suspected that the grandfather was just gone for good. Not so, fortunately.<br /><br />The second part of the movie took us to watch how the rich kids, succumbed to temptations (gluttony, spoiledness, competitveness, TV game addiction), were eliminated one after another (reality show?). In the nut sorting room, when the innocent looking squirrels, sensing the threat of the approaching girl, stopped their nut-cracking and prepared for attack, gave people the creeps.<br /><br />Charlie's grandparents and parents, with their big screen shots, have displayed their love of Charlie well. But it was Freddie Highmore who was a natural. He portrayed the young and determined Charlie who would not give up his family for anything else. Johnny Depp, with his sinister look every now and then when he detected the unlovable traits of the "sophisticated" children, built up an unpredictable and secretive air around him.<br /><br />The inside of the factory was richly imagined and luxuriously decorated, from a food paradise of luscious colours to top of the notch invention room and flying elevator. The movie succeeded in placing that the people at the centre, they were never dwarfed nor sidetracked by the special effects and the colorful props.<br /><br />Does the movie appeal to the child side in every person? Absolutely. Does the film appeal to the adult side in every one? To some extent. Yes. A delightful movie with a heart this is.</p></body></html>

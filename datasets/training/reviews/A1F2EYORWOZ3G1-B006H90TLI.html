<meta name="summary" content="what happened?"></head><body><p>I watched the movie, never read the book, heard the hype and read other reviews. I have to say I am very disappointed in this film. It was great until the last 5 minutes. Then it just.... wandered off to nowhere. No closure, no real ending. Did they leave it open for a sequel? Are they going to create serial killer serial films? That is the only thing that makes sense with this ending.<br />The acting is very good. The cinematography is great. The sounds are great. The plot is good... until the end.<br />I would recommend this movie only if you have 2 hours of time to waste... and remember you won't get it back.<br />The coen brother have done other great films. 'Blood Simple', 'Fargo' and 'Miller's Crossing' come to mind immediately and each of those is superb. I would recommend watching one of those first, or instead of.</p></body></html>

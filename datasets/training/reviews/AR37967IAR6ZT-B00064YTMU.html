<meta name="summary" content="Foxx steals the movie."></head><body><p>Though this Michael Mann thriller never really answers the question a friend of mine asked of it (i.e., "Why does the killer need a taxi when he could just rent a car other than to explain the title?") and has holes in the logic of its story, COLLATERAL is a solid, fun movie that just keeps moving, getting more and more twisted and interesting. Tom Cruise gets the showy role of contract killer Vincent and proves himself more than worthy, but the great Jamie Foxx, in many ways, steals the movie out from under him as Max, the hostage cab driver. It's a gritty film. The digital camerawork, which can weaken the impact of some films for me, is one of COLLATERAL's strengths, adding to its mood and keeping things uneasy and weird.</p></body></html>

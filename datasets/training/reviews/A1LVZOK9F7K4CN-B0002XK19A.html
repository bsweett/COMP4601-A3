<meta name="summary" content="Even better than the first..."></head><body><p>Spider-Man 2 begins with the artwork of Alex Ross.  There is a reason for this because - as anyone who has read his book, Marvels, will realize - he has influenced the look of the film.  Here, we see the Marvels through the eyes of ordinary people.  Sam Raimi started this look in the first movie, but here he has deepened and expanded it. <p>Spider-Man 2 is a better movie than the first one.  The reason for this isn't the fight scenes - although they are the best super-hero fight scenes ever!  What's great about this movie is that it is true to its subject-matter.  I attribute a lot of its success to novelist and comic-book geek, Michael Chabon, who contributed to the story.  The script is light-years better than the original's and it captures the spirit of the Marvel Comics.  There are a lot of smart in-jokes, including a completely random homage to Queer as Folk!  <p>Spider-Man 2 shows where the Batman franchise went wrong.  It is a truly fun movie, which the fans deserve.</p></body></html>

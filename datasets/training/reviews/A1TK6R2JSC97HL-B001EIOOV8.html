<meta name="summary" content="In the end, Vegas whacks everybody..."></head><body><p>"Casino" briskly tells of the rise and fall of the stranglehold of organized crime over Las Vegas.  Unfortunately, it's actually two stories that sometimes fail to come together, leaving us befuddled as to each.<br /><br />The star of the show is Deniro, playing Sam "Ace" Rothstein.  Ace is to gambling what Einstein was to physics (he micromeasures each cube of dice), capable of setting the odds for any wager in America.  A man who doesn't know how to lose money, Rothstein is the lone Jew among a sea of Italians - the one man the mob can trust to run its flagship casino in Vegas.  While the leaders of organized crime watch from the distance (they can get no closer to Vegas than a general store in Kansas), Ace keeps the Casino profitable and various operatives skim the profits.  For Rothstein, Vegas is the realization of a dream - a place where his brand of gambling is legal, a moral car wash where his sins are washed away.  Trouble brews on two fronts.  The heads back home send Nicky Santoro, a mob enforcer and an old friend of Rothstein's, to keep things in order.  Played by Joe Pesci, Nicky is a one-man weapon of mass destruction, of voracious greed and infinite violence.  He's the "Conan the Barabarian" of Vegas - and in a city that seems to encourage everything, Santoro soon becomes everybody's enemy.  Vegas and Nicky seem well matched for each other, but soon the two develop a state of warfare against each other and, for his power, Santoro is eventually outmatched.  Rothstein's other thorn is the woman who will become his wife, Sharon Stone as Ginger, a hustler who will eventually steal, then break Rothstein's heart.<br /><br />While Rothstein battles his nearby demons, the mob destroys itself in Vegas, setting itself up for a ludicrous fall.  (Concerned over the diminishing "skim", the captains dispatch their most inept underboss, the man who will ultimately and unwittingly betray their entire operation to the feds.)<br /><br />While an interesting story, "Casino" is seldom a coherent story - it plays like "Goodfellas in Vegas" (complete with high-speed 1970's rock) even though the story often becomes more impersonal than "Goodfellas" was.  The plot never explains how a superlative manager like Ace let fortunes of the Casino dwindle, or why (when he was doing well) the Captains sent Santoro to Vegas at all - a decision which will easily haunt them.  (Santoro is easily more of a hazard than a help.)  Stone and Deniro have no chemistry at all - why Ace throws his heart to a woman who doesn't even like him is never explained, and they spend most of the movie hating each other.  Hurrying to match Ace's story to that of Vegas, the script runs out of steam and takes the easy way out - with a crescendo of violence that does nothing to inform the story we've spent about 3 hours watching.</p></body></html>

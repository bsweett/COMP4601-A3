Following the instructions, they took the ingredients - a bunch of old movies - half-baked them and came up with a confection that should be awful but actually is decent, although not very nutritious.<br /><br />The Island takes place in a near-future world where a biotech company clones wealthy people so the customers can have new organs available when needed.  The clones are developed as adults and still require intellectual stimulation to maintain viability.  As a result, the clones live a regimented life in a secret city, laboring under the belief that the rest of the world is contaminated.  Occasionally, a clone wins the lottery that allows them to go to the Island, the last uncontaminated place on Earth; in reality, the excursion is merely to an operating room where they are cut up and their organs gathered.<br /><br />Ewan MacGregor plays Lincoln, a clone who has begun to question what is going on around him.  Along with Scarlett Johannsen's Jordan, they escape to the real world, with all sorts of paramilitary folk chasing them.  Thus we go from sci-fi to standard action flick:  lots of chases, gunfire and explosions.  In other words, while the first part of this movie may be thought-provoking, the second half is turn-off-your-brain time.  Not that that's bad.<br /><br />The most obvious influence on this movie is Logan's Run (especially the end), but there are other clear influences including THX 1138, Blade Runner, Minority Report and even Return of the Jedi (with a motorcycle chase scene).  So, this may not be the most original of movies, but somehow it works.  MacGregor and Johannsen are skillful enough to make us care about their characters, and when that happens, most of the rest falls into place.</p></body></html>

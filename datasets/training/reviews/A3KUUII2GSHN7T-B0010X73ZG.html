<meta name="summary" content="Darabont almost pulls off the impossible...almost."></head><body><p>It's been said that there are three impossible things to pull off in the world of film making.<br /><br />#1. Get Sean Penn to believably play the leading man in a romantic comedy.<br /><br />#2. Get Kevin Costner the actor to play a role that even slightly differentiates from him being the real life Kevin Costner.<br /><br />#3. Successfully adapt a Stephen King horror film into a movie without completely sabotaging the script (see Kubrick's The Shining).<br /><br />Frank Darabont, while having formerly been able to adapt The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile with great success, and while Meathead (Rob Reiner) managed to do the same with King's The Body (which was adapted into Reiner's Stand By Me), the horror aspect of King's writing has provided many director's with very little success. A quick glance at past failures read likes a Who's Who of pathetic filmography:<br /><br />Cujo (1983)<br />Silver Bullet (1985) - I actually like this one<br />Maximum Overdrive (1986)<br />Needful Things (1993)<br />The Dark Half (1993)<br />Thinner (1996)<br /><br />1990's Misery and the pre 1980 King films notwithstanding, seldom has a director managed to pull of a successful adaptation, especially those King films that had dealt with the supernatural like 1983's The Dead Zone or 1989's Pet Sematary. It's not a knock on King, just a telling fact that his style of writing doesn't always translate well to modern film.<br /><br />Then came The Mist. Darabont sinks his teeth into this one and the result is a very entertaining film that will keep the viewer entrenched for the long run. If ever someone was capable of taking a King book and translating it to the big screen, Frank is the man; however, The Mist at times seems a little too forced and many of the characters simply seem hollow throughout, which contrasted with Darabont's former King films, is a bizarre observation to make considering Shawshank and The Green Mile were heavily inter-laden with character development. Here, however, the story is the main character, and the principle players seem nothing short of h'orderves for an ending that Darabont no doubt put together as the measuring stick for the entire film. I have to say, the ending of this film will stay with you and is as powerful a horror finale as I've ever seen.<br /><br />This ending is the result of a plot that deals with a tiny town in Maine, where perhaps fifty townsfolk, including a father (played by Thomas Jane) and his son, find themselves trapped in a grocery store when an ominous mist rips through town, bringing with it dangerous, unseen creatures that proceed to rip a number of the doubting townsfolk to pieces. It is classic King, and when it's all said and done, Darabont stands to have almost pulled off the impossible, and that is something to be commended.</p></body></html>

For five years, scientist Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) has kept hidden from the world while searching for a cure to his gamma-irradiated DNA that transforms him into an unbelievably strong creature known as the Hulk. Banner struggles to control the raging power within him and prevent the US Army from turning this power into a devastating living weapon. Directed by Louis Leterrier (The Transporter 1 & 2), "The Incredible Hulk" is a fast-paced action-packed adventure that succeeds over the previous 2003 film. The latest comic book adaptation offers plenty of excitement and well embraces the popular 1970's television series. The climatic battle between the Hulk and the Abomination is really exciting. "The Incredible Hulk" also stars Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, Tim Blake Nelson and Academy Award-winner William Hurt, and features cameos by series star Lou Ferrigno and comic book creator Stan Lee.<br /><br />With its stunning picture quality and intense audio, "The Incredible Hulk" packs quite a punch on Blu-Ray. The 2008 comic book movie is presented in a 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format. The Blu-Ray has a nicely detailed and remarkably sharp video transfer. Its 5.1 DTS-HD audio is really dynamic. The special features include 40 minutes of deleted scenes, a comic book picture gallery, alternate opening sequence and a feature-length audio commentary with director Louis Leterrier and star Tim Roth. "The Making of The Incredible Hulk" documentary offers several interviews with director, cast and production crew. It also includes four short behind-the-scenes featurettes: Becoming the Hulk, Becoming the Abomination, Anatomy of a Hulk Out and From Comic Book to Screen. Overall, "The Incredible Hulk" gets a "B+".</p></body></html>

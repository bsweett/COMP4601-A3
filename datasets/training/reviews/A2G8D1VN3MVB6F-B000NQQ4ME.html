<meta name="summary" content="Great Movie, Unexpected Surprise"></head><body><p>Hey, I bet you are here looking for a movie to get. I know you here about all these movies, how good they are, and you think that its all hype.  Well, I can tell you that I was thinking the same thing about this movie before I got it.  When, I got this movie and watched it though I was surprised. Really, really surprised. The movie was a really good adventure in which one man tries beyond human endurance to save his family. The struggle this one man endures to accomplish this is thrilling and invigorating. The result of this fact is that you watch the movie, and never really think about how long it is, or how much time you spent watching the movie. The scenery was great, and the dialogue was even better, so  in the end you have a really good movie which is a pleasant story. Get it and enjoy!!!!!!</p></body></html>

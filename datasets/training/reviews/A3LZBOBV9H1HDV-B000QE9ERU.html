It has a smaller production budget than "Daredevil", $33 Million compared to Daredevil's $78 Million production budget. This movie is great from beginning to end. Thomas Jane's performance as Frank Castle / The Punisher was better than Dolph Lundgren and proves you don't need a big guy to be The Punisher, he did a great job. John Travolta's performance as the villain, Howard Saint, was great, too, and made a great villain against Thomas Jane's The Punisher. Putting both Thomas Jane and John Travolta together in this movie was a great idea. Their characters are great and they both are an essential part of the movie. Will Patton's performance as Quentin Glass was great, too, it wasn't over the top. The rest of the cast did a great job. Jonathan Hensleigh, who also wrote "Armageddon", "The Saint", "Jumanji", "Die Hard With A Venegance", & "A Far Off Place", co-wrote the screenplay & story with Michael France and makes his directorial debut in this well made action film, He did a great job. The screenplay & story was great. The music by Carlo Siliotto was excellent. The cinematography by Conrad W. Hall was excellent. The film editing by Steven Kemper was great. The production design by Michael Z. Hanan and costume design by Lisa Tomczeszyn was great. The casting by Pam Dixon was great. The art direction by John Dexter, John Hansen, Steve Saklad was great. The set decoration by Casey Hallenbeck was great. Go see this movie if you want to, before or after "Kill Bill Volume 2". They both have the same theme: Revenge. The soundtrack, not the score, is excellent. Get the soundtrack if you want to. This movie is a good competitor to "Kill Bill Volume 2".</p></body></html>

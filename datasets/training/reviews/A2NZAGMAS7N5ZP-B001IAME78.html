<meta name="summary" content="Hulk Smash Baby"></head><body><p>If you ignored this movie thinking it was going to be a sequel to the inferior 2003 Ang Lee adaptation, you did wrong because this is how Hulk is meant to be. For the first time we get a clear perspective of Hulk. Unlike the previous movie this adaptation proves that Hulk can be shown in the big screen as both a threat and a hero.<br /><br />The movie begins with Banner undergoing an experiment that obviously goes wrong; and unlike the previous movie, this one ignores everything that occurred before. This adaptation is much more loyal to the comics and The TV show. The setting is more realistic and we don't have the annoying comic book transitions that were applied to the first Hulk movie.<br /><br />so is this movie worth it? Hell yeah! The effects are better; the design of Hulk is better and meaner. Not to mention the last fight with Abomination, it will leave you breathless. Forget about the other Hulk movie, this is a re-boot like Batman Begins. For all comic book fans and Hulk fans this is the Hulk you were waiting for, don't hesitate.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RAITING: 4 OUT OF 5</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Ranks Right Up There with Superman and Batman Begins!"></head><body><p>The three pinnacle comic books films are Spider-Man 2, Batman Begins, and the first Superman movie.  Batman Begins and Spider-Man 2 have something in common; they have comic book fans making and writing the films.  If you're going to make a film about a comic book character, then you need someone who is familiar with the characters and the world they inhabit.  This is why so many of the comic book films today are not very good.<br /><br />Al Gough and Miles Millar co-wrote the screenplay for this film.  They are the same "dynamic duo" who gave life and re-ignited the Superman mythology with Smallville.  As comic book fans, they obviously knew what they were doing when they penned this fantastic sequel that surpasses the original at almost every turn.<br /><br />There is a reason why Spider-Man is Marvel's most popular character and the icon for it's company.  No one has the thumb on justice and doing what's right more than Superman, nor does any character surpass Batman for his psychological complexities. Spider-Man is the hero that everyone can relate to.  This is because Spider-Man is a hero with realistic problems that everyone has and goes through.  Despite his impressive array of abilities, Peter Parker has trouble attending classes at his university.  He can barely pay the rent each month.  There was once a scene in one of the comic book series, where Peter Parker has forgotten to do the laundry, and the only clean shirt he has to wear to work is a Strawberry Shortcake t-shirt that a co-worker at the Bugle had given him as a gag.  This is the life of Peter Parker.<br /><br />The movie really hones in on Peter's character and his problems.  He gets fired from his job for always being late.  He's late to watch Mary Jane in her play.  He's back-logged on his paychecks because he's already asked for an advance at the Bugle.  He's on the verge of failing his courses at school.  How is he able to balance his life as Peter and Spider-Man?  This is the inner conflict that befalls him.  At one point, the load is such a burden, that he feels he can't be Spider-Man anymore.  And, yet again, the audience can relate to his character.  The movie works so well because it focuses on Peter Parker instead of Spider-Man.  Batman Begins works because it focuses on Bruce Wayne instead of Batman.  And Smallville is a hit show because it focuses Clark Kent.  Audiences now want and demand rich and interesting characters.  And Spider-Man 2 delivers big-time!<br /><br />Tobey Maguire is wonderful as Peter Parker.  I confess that I had my reservations about him when I first heard that he was cast to play the part.  He mirrors Peter Parker from the comic book so well.  Part of that tribute has to go to director Sam Raimi who is one of the biggest Spider-Man fans around.  He still has a poster of Spider-Man in his bedroom from when he was a kid.  Tobey is able to humanize Peter to such an extent that we share his joy and his pain.  Tobey has also mastered the ability to communicate the feelings of Peter with a simple look.  Words aren't necessary.  We all know what he's feeling.<br /><br />Spider-Man's new foe is Doctor Octopus.  He's wonderfully played by Alfred Molina.  Spider-Man has had many foes over the years, but during the 70s-80s, you can consider Doctor Octopus to be one of his best and most creative foes.  He is not as much a personal nemesis as the Green Goblin, but he has a great intelligence.  Molina give Doctor Octopus an almost sympathetic feel.  Given powers that are a bit similar to Peter's, Octopus obviously chooses a different path.<br /><br />The special effects are much better in this film than the last.  We see Spider-Man swinging in between cars and trucks, fighting Doctor Octopus against the sides of buildings and battling Doctor Octopus on top of a subway train.<br /><br />This DVD is fantastic with lots of great extras, including interviews with famous comic book artists about Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus, and the women of Spider-Man's world.<br /><br />As a former comic book reader for nearly fifteen years, it's wonderful to see this fun character come to life on the big screen.  But, you don't need to be a comic book fan to enjoy it.  As I said, most everyone can relate to Spider-Man.</p></body></html>

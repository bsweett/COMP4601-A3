<meta name="summary" content="Cubicles Beware!!!"></head><body><p>Office Space is a ruthless, no holds-barred comedy. Anyone who has ever spent even a day working in a cubicle will definitely appreciate this and relate to the characters. It's a different kind of Hollywood comedy; funny and clever. Ron Livingston is terrific and this is the kind of unique film Jennifer Aniston should do more often (no more Along Came Polly's). I enjoyed Office Space and recommend it to anyone with their own office space that they want to knock down and burn. This is a highly enjoyable and cute film.</p></body></html>

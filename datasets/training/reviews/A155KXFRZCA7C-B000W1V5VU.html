<meta name="summary" content="What was that?"></head><body><p>I was very excited to see Ocean's 13 and I hoped that it would be a great stylish film. Sadly enough, expectations weren't met at all. The plot was unrealistic and so weird, and the storyline had loose ends.<br />Regarding the acting you had the feeling just like in Ocean's 12 that here are a bunch of $20 million actors strolling around who truly enjoyed their payday. It was good to see Andy Garcia, but not enough of him - he should have driven in his Cadillac SUV from the TV commercial, so that he gets out of the office. Producer Jerry Weintraub had to be in the flick as he's often in his own films, and he drove off in his very own Maserati Quattroporte - that was fun.<br />The fictitious hotel structure was unique, but not really anything that fits on the Las Vegas Strip, and therefore so unrealistic that it was almost a joke.<br />Al Pacino was there as the bad guy, and although he had the characteristics of a certain real winning Las Vegas hotel owner, somehow the edge and sophistication was missing.<br />I was hoping to see more of Las Vegas to add flair to the flick, but the film plays mostly in offices and enclosed rooms here and there.<br />Is it worth seeing this film? Let's put it this way, I would have lived perfectly happy without ever seeing it. There are a lot of slow passages and it's sad because with that kind of budget, pool of actors and premise a so much better movie could have been made. But then there was no foul language aside from one outburst and there were no stupid sensual scenes, ... so it's a save movie that should have received a PG rating although it's not a film for kids. I doubt it that after this Ocean's 13 that there's an Ocean's 14 in the works, but if there is then they have to kick it up really a whole lot.</p></body></html>

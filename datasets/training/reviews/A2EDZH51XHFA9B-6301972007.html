Huston would go on, of course, to perch at the top of Hollywood's A-list for decades, and more than any other film he directed with the arguable exception of The African Queen, The Maltese Falcon shows every reason why.<br /><br />Humphrey Bogart plays Dashiell Hammett's immortal antihero Sam Spade, and more than any other actor, Bogart has come to represent Spade in film form, despite having never made another Spade movie and looking nothing like the "blond Satan" described in Hammett's novel. What is, perhaps, most sunning about Bogart's performance (if it is not his best, it is tied with The African Queen and The Desperate Hours for that honor) is that so much of the book was removed, including most every scene that illuminates Spade's relationship with Brigid O'Shaughnessy, and Bogart still brings the role to life even for those who have no idea who Sam Spade is. Mary Astor, an A-list star at the time (The Maltese Falcon was her ninety-eighth film) who has since fallen into relative obscurity, plays the duplicitous Ms. O'Shaughnessy to the hilt, both helpless and manipulative at the same time; Astor's portrayal of O'Shaughnessy still stands over sixty years later as one of the most subtle and nuanced performances to ever grace a screen. Peter Lorre, riding a wave of success that started with his amazing performance in M and continued through the Hammer horror films he made just prior to his death, gives what for any other actor would be a career-best performance as Joel Cairo; for Lorre, it ranks with his performance in M. The main characters are rounded out by Sydney Greenstreet, in his debut film role at the age of fifty-nine, and Elisha Cook, Jr., almost forty but looking surprisingly like the twenty-one-year-old tough of Hammett's novel.<br /><br />If there is a flaw to the film, and in most films it is the major flaw, it is that Huston's adaptation of Hammett's novel is, to say the least, a bit lacking in continuity and substance. What Huston managed to preserve, however, is the flavor; what parts of the novel exist in the film are rabidly faithful to their source material, and some of the cuts have obvious reasons given the time the movie was made (for example, the casual sex between Spade and O'Shaughnessy, or his strip-search of her at the beginning of the book's long climax). The relationships between the characters are altered for the film, but Huston has covered all the bases, making sure the alterations don't leave wear at the edges. In other words, Huston has crafted a perfect script out of a flawed adaptation, and for that reason it's impossible to find fault with the adaptation. Even the plot holes seem as if they're put in for effect.<br /><br />The music is a tad overdone, but hey, it was 1941. What do you expect?<br /><br />If there is such a thing as a perfect film, The Maltese Falcon is one of them. *****</p></body></html>

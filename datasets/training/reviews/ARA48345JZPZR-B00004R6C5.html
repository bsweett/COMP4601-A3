Her warm fictional remembrance of them as Atticus and Jem in To Kill a Mockingbird is filled with respect and love.  She had a story to tell of race and hatred and tolerance and understanding, but underpinning all of it is her love of the two central males of her childhood, her kind and wise father, and her loving, protective brother.  This is the heart of her book, and it is the heart of this faithfully adapted film of that book.  <p>In an age that usually draws males and females in broad caricatures, depicting brutishness and carnality as the norm, and crassness and &quot;in-your-face&quot; as the only form of honesty, the characters in Mockingbird are not only refreshing, they are a revelation.<p>The book and the film is largely about decency.  Simple human decency.  The characters in this story of childhood adventures, awakenings and surprises, with the trial of an innocent black man in the South of the 30's at its center, are by and large decent people.<p>  From Scout's father, Atticus, sincerely defending the man, to the Judge wanting a fair trial and result, to the defendant Tom and his family, to Cal the housekeeper, to the lady next door, to the Reverend, to the simple and plain but honest Sheriff, and even the farmer momentarily caught up in the lynch mob mentality....all are essentially decent people struggling within their society's preconceived assumptions and intolerances to do what's right. And, of course, there is Boo.<p>Yes, the world has its share of ignorant, cowardly, and hate-filled Bob Ewells.  But, they do not define the world, so long as there are good men and women striving to do the right thing.<p>This flawlessly cast movie is a masterpiece.  It captures the innocense and wonder of childhood, and the sometimes tragedy &amp; struggle of adulthood without preaching. The performances are first rate down to the smallest role.  Robert Mulligan manages to capture the world from a child's perspective without belaboring it.<p>The world has spun around a few times since I saw this movie on it's release when I was little more than a child myself.  It captured and moved me then.  It moves me now.  It's simple truths and humanity are timeless.</p></body></html>

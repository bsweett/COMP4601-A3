Somewhat interesting and thought-provoking, but maddening story-line that almost left me with a headache: (scenes like the two young lovers dancing atop his body while he is undergoing "the procedure" truly required a massive stretch of the imagination - despite the joy of seeing Kirsten in action!)<br /><br />Definitely requires a suspension of belief and a real open-mindedness to visionary cinema. It's a unique film that's worth a look, for sure.</p></body></html>

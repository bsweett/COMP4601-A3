To solve this problem, the writers came up with a brilliant story that would serve as a closer to a few episodes that occurred during the series that were held as fan-favorites, of course the episodes I'm referring to deal with the deadliest villains this crew ever faced, the Borg.  The Borg are cybernetic beings that are linked into one another in a sort of hive, in their society there is no individuality, everyone is the same, and their collective goal is to assimilate every being in the universe, adding their characteristics and culture into theirs, therefore making them the ultimate beings.  In the series, the first appearance of the Borg was a 2-part episode arc titled "The Best of Both Worlds", in the story the Borg capture Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart), assimilating him and all his knowledge into their collective.  This leaves the rest of the crew of the Enterprise-D in a massive dilemma, do they stage a rescue for their beloved captain, or do what is right for Starfleet and destroy the Borg cube and their captain along with it.  In the episodes, the crew led by Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) led a rescue to get Captain Picard back, and after successfully removing the Borg influence from him, gained some very helpful insight into the inner-workings of this new villainous species.  So for the story in this movie the writers chose to force Captain Picard and his crew to face that terrible time yet again, and this time the Borg are much more powerful, and have some new tricks up their sleeves.<br /><br />"Star Trek:  First Contact" as I stated above finds the crew of the newly commissioned Enterprise-E coming face-to-face with the Borg yet again.  However, the difference this time is that the Borg has learned a new trick, time travel.  During a conflict between the Enterprise and a Borg cube, the cube launches a Borg sphere in an attempt to escape before the destruction of the cube ship.  However, this sphere contains the capability for time travel, so with the Enterprise in hot pursuit the cube travels back in time with the Enterprise close behind and transporting both ships into the past.  The specific moment in time that the sphere picked to return to seemed random at first, but instead held a much more sinister reason, the sphere returned to the past to stop a scientist from conducting the first warp drive test.  If the Borg succeeds in stopping this warp drive test, two things happen, the future that the crew of the Enterprise knows ceases to exist because without warp drive there is no Starfleet, and the second thing is that if the test doesn't occur, first contact with the alien race known as Vulcans will not happen.  So, not only does the Enterprise-E and her crew have to save the people of the past from the assimilation of the Borg, but also save their own futures before its too late.<br /><br />In their second adventure on the big screen the crew of the Enterprise-E were forced to tackle their deadliest villains, the Borg.  Many fans that were disillusioned by the previous `Star Trek' movie effort, "Star Trek:  Generations", were very pleased to learn that the Borg were being chosen as the villains for this film.  With the expectations for this movie very high, the stage was set for `Star Trek' to once again be number one at the box office.  The problem with hype is that most of the time the hype overshadows the movie, and though the movie may still be successful, it would still be considered somewhat of a failure if the film even remotely disappointed any fans.  This problem was easily bypassed by this movie, the creative forces behind "Star Trek:  First Contact" crafted a terrific story of intense drama, fast-paced and energetic action, and some bits of humor, and needless to say audiences were not disappointed in the least.  In fact, many `Trekkies' hold "Star Trek:  First Contact" in high regard, and view it as possibly one of the best `Star Trek' films ever, and definitely one of the best for the `Next Generation' crew.  The actors were all very solid in their performance, which was expected since these are characters they portrayed for 7 seasons on the TV show, and in the previous movie, so by now their characters are instinctual to them.  The special effects were top-notch, some of the best effects work in this series can be found in this movie.  In truth, there isn't one single negative comment I can make regarding this movie; this film is definitely top-notch for this franchise!<br /><br />"Star Trek:  First Contact" is rated PG-13 for violence.</p></body></html>

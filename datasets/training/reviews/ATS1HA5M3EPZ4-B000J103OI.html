I couldn't pick one out of a line up to save my life but I know it's a fashion line...of shoes, or purses or something.  In any case, I watched this film with my wife because it looked entertaining.  I'm a movie buff and Anne Hathaway is not only cute but she's a talented force coming up through the ranks of Hollywood.  After seeing her in Brokeback mountain, I wanted to see what else she was in (besides the Disney Princess flicks).<br /><br />I was not disappointed.  She gives a great performance as Andrea Sachs, a straight forward girl from the mid-west who applies for a position as second assistant to Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), the Satanesque Editor in Chief of Runway, a fashion magazine of Godzilla like proportions.  She aspires to be a journalist, not a fashion editor, so she is shocked to find that it's a dream job for many and that if she can hold out for a year she can work anywhere she wants.<br /><br />The unfolding of the film's message is subtle, showing how when one gets ahead in the business they thereby loose everything else in their life, arguably including their soul.  As she starts out snubbing the industry, she soon learns she has to integrate herself in order to make it work (when in Rome...).  Things start to fall apart in her personal life though; her friends loose interest, her boyfriend complains she isn't around anymore and they have nothing in common.  This is done without them becoming unreasonable jerks as well.<br /><br />As for the other performers; Streep runs away with the movie in whatever scene she's in.  Her low key and delicate approach to the character instead of being a high volume demanding taskmaster is brilliant.  Anyone can be a screaming bitch, but Streep puts class in her strut and her dialogue showing why she is one America's premier actresses.  She's a blast to watch but you want to kill her at the same time.<br /><br />Other notable performances include Emily Blunt as the first assistant, Simon Baker as the journalist who may help Andy get her foot in the journalism door and most especially Stanley Tucci, brilliantly playing Miranda's right hand man and lead fashion expert.<br /><br />The movie is very entertaining and a good story that is very relatable to most.  It is thankfully NOT about fashion, or it would have lost me five minutes into the movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Wes Craven's Best Since New Nightmare"></head><body><p>I'm a big fan of thrillers.  I especially love good thrillers and this is a good thriller.  Wes Craven, the director of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GETUDI">A Nightmare on Elm Street (Infinifilm Edition)</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000068IEU">The Last House on the Left</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000AOX0E">The Serpent And The Rainbow</a>, brings another exhilirating tale to the screen.<br /><br />Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams) is kidnapped on a plane by a man (Cillian Murphy) who wants something from her father.<br /><br />This movie is one I do recommend.  The DVD includes an audio commentary with Wes Craven, outtakes and bloopers, and few featurettes.  THis is a true thriller and one that's actually good.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></body></html>

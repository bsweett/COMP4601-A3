<meta name="summary" content="Death makes life fatal and the show that goes on morbid"></head><body><p>A strange film indeed echoing The Tree of Life. Has the West in its vast financial, debt and economic crisis become absolutely morbid when having to face the loss of its hegemony in the world? I believe so and there are two attitudes possible.<br /><br />Either you refuse it and you get angry and you start accusing everyone and the whole world of some kind of plot against you, like in Greece and you burn the central public library. That's the choice of the wife of the lover of the dying wife-mother-daughter-cousin-relative of the main male character marvellously rendered by Clooney.<br /><br />Or you start taming your anger and looking beyond this narrow-minded reaction and you try to come to terms with the situation, with death, with an affair, with so many things that should not prevent life from going on. Because life has to go on, even in Spain, Italy, Ireland, France and elsewhere in this Western world.<br /><br />And the choice is personal and has to be negotiated in the film by a middle-aged widowed husband and father; by a teenage daughter that had difficult relations with the mother; by a young daughter who is still a child and does not even know what death is; by the lover who loved or did not love but used the wife before her death and implanted in her some mirage; by the wife of that occasional and indelicate lover; by the members of the fund that is supposed to take care of a big chunk of one of the Hawaiian islands, a territory that is still virginal and is greedily desired by some real estate developer whose brother in law is the indelicate lover; by so many other people around that comatose woman who signed her will to be unplugged if she was to get into such a situation.<br /><br />Parting from the dying, nearly dead person is always difficult and Clooney and his fellow actors or family members play that drama, that painful trauma with the dignity and the restraint necessary to make it poignant without making it melodramatic. Just for that reason you should see that film and enjoy it. Take it as a good preparation for the traumas, personal, national or universal, that may happen tomorrow at sunrise, if not before.<br /><br />It is not the Tree of Life, but the Tree of Death that goes on growing beyond death because Death is Life and Life never stopped in front of Death.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</p></body></html>

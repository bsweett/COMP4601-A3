BUBBA HO TEP, directed by PHANTASM'S Don Coscarelli, unfortunately, is not a great flick.<br />Bruce Campbell is amazingly perfect in the role of Elvis Presley/Sebastian Haff.  According to storywriter Joe R. Lansdale, Presley switched places with one of his impersonators, so that it was really Haff who died and not Presley.  Presley continued to play the impersonator until he fell off the stage, injured his hip and ended up in a nursing home.  Campbell's transformation transcends the good make-up job; Campbell gets the intonations down, the sneer, the embodiment of the tortured Elvis psyche.  It's probably his most consistently good performance.<br />Ossie Davis does well as Presley's buddy---a black man who says he is John F. Kennedy.  They &quot;dyed&quot; him and keep his brain active with a battery that's located in Washington, DC.  They form an uneasy alliance, as Kennedy thinks just maybe Presley knew about the Dallas assassination.<br />Meanwhile, these geriatric sleuths find themselves battling an ancient Egyptian mummy who sends scarab beetles out to his victims.  Some of the effects are excellent and Presley's nailing of the beetle in his bedpan is hilarious.  The mummy himself, played by Bob Ivy, is a Freddy clone who ultimately just isn't frightening.<br />There's a lot of pontification from Presley on how he has ruined his life, but at the same time, he somewhat enjoys his alter ego.  Coscarelli's downfall is that while we understand we have geriatric heroes, his slow pacing doesn't help the suspense scenes out at all.  The fiery climax is ultimately unsatisfying because it burns itself out.<br />BUBBA HO TEP deserves praise for its unique subject matter, Lansdale proving what an unusual horror writer he is, and of course for the outstanding job Campbell does.  I just wanted more!!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I can resist everything, except chocolat"></head><body><p>Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) comes with her daughter to a quiet little village in France where people value Tranquilit&eacute; - Tranquility. Just before Lent she opens a chocolatier that will turn the town upside down.<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Vianne Rocher: And these are for your husband. Unrefined cacao nips from Guatemala, to awaken the passions.<br />Yvette Marceau: Psshh. You've obviously never met my husband.<br />Vianne Rocher: Well, you've obviously never tried these.<br />===============================<br /><br />Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina) sees her as a threat to the morals and tranquility the people of Flavigny-sur-Ozerain treasure. He starts a crusade against her, and against a group of vagabonds headed by Roux (Johnny Depp) who arrive by boat. When Vianne Rocher befriends them, a line is drawn in the sand:<br /><br />-----------------<br />Comte de Reynaud: Let me try to put this into perspective for you. The first Comte de Reynaud expelled all the radical Huguenots in this village. You and your truffles present a far lesser challenge.<br />=============================<br /><br />But to paraphrase Oscar Wilde, "I can resist everything, except chocolat."<br /><br />I like everything about this film, and everyone in it is chock full o' talent. Somehow, though, the whole was equal to less than the sum of its parts. And less was not more, less was less. Was it too many cooks spoil la mousse au chocolat? This was an attempt to create a fable, and that is a very delicate thing. Like a chocolat souffl&eacute;, someone slams a door and the whole thing collapses. Maybe it was just me. Your mileage may vary.<br /><br />Speaking of fables, Edward Scissorhands, for me, now, there was a fable. Johnny Depp was fabulous in it. Sometimes you can't create a fable, you just have to use your divining rod and find one. Sometimes the magic just doesn't work, especially when you set out to create a fable. Chocolat is magic, but too much chocolat is just an overdose.<br /><br />Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m made this after The Cider House Rules, and as they were filming, they learned that they had 7 Oscar nominations, and would win for Michael Caine, best supporting actor, and the script by John Irving. Chocolat would also garner five nominations, but no wins. Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m is married to Lena Olin, who plays Josephine in Chocolat.<br /><br />I don't fault him for that, or think it adversely affected the film, I just mention it because you can tell that everyone is having a great time making the film, Chocolat. They are literally making chocolat, and eating chocolat, too. It is a family affair, with old friends reuniting, and new friendships being forged.<br /><br />Juliette Binoche and Lena Olin both appeared together in The Unbearable Lightness of Being, where they were two corners of a love triangle with Daniel Day-Lewis. Olin played Sabina, the one who wore her grandfather's derby while making love.<br /><br />Lasse Hallstr&ouml;m had worked with Johnny Depp before, when he directed him in What's Eating Gilbert Grape? In Chocolat, Johnny finally gets to play guitar, and we hear him do some blues and Django Reinhardt's Minor Swing. It is a real treat to hear Depp play Le Jazz Hot, and he is not half bad. He has some great vintage guitars and a Dobro.<br /><br />Peter Stormare is great as Josephine's husband, a wife beater. He is not quite a scary as he was in Fargo, but he is scary enough, and also a little sad. Alfred Molina is kind of an uptight wet blanket, but you can see that he is just an insufferable self righteous buzz kill because he is sad. Nothing that a little, or a lot, of chocolat won't cure.<br /><br />---------------------------<br />Vianne Rocher: [to the Comte de Reynaud] Ah, good morning. Can I interest you in some nipples of Venus?<br />==============================================<br /><br />Judi Dench is fabulous, as usual, and so is Leslie Caron, though her part is so small I didn't even notice her. The director apologized that her part was so small. She was in Gershwin's An American in Paris with Gene Kelly, directed by Vincente Minnelli. She starred in Lerner and Loewe's Gigi with Maurice Chevalier, also directed by Liza's dad and Judy Garland's husband, for goodness sake! I haven't even mentioned Daddy Long Legs with Fred Astaire! Leslie Caron is a legend of the silver screen!<br /><br />With all the fabulousness on display, you'd think that they could create a decent fable.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BX8R1A">The Chumscrubber</a> (2005) ....

There were a few enjoyable movies among them, but their best were generally far from the best of the larger crossgenres epic vein they were a part of (think the Star Wars movies, Terminator 2, Braveheart, and other big, powerful greats like those for comparisons from the same timeframe) and they were also falling far short of hitting the mark as adaptations of their source material and of presenting the world of modern comics to the much larger movie audience.  The best jobs, by far, in that department were being done by certain animated works: "Batman - The Animated Series", "Superman: Last Son Of Krypton", "Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm".<br /><br />  Flash forward just a few years from when the bigscreen comic adaptations temporarily disappeared and all of a sudden: the X-Men series.  Batman Begins.  Spider-Man.  Elektra.  And now "Superman Returns", in one of the biggest, most incredible, better-than-ever comebacks of all time.  This is the level of movie that the Superman comics have deserved to have up there representing them for a long, long time.<br /><br />  I'll admit it - the movie doesn't nail the realism mark nearly as well as the modern comics (or even the younger-geared, animated, Superman material of the 90s for that matter).  And it does rely heavily on a couple of pretty large coincidences.  In this case,that doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter in the same way that, when "Star Wars" is playing, it doesn't matter that in space you wouldn't Really be able to hear those great explosions as X-Wings and Trade Federation Droidships are being blasted to kingdom come.  It doesn't matter in the way that, when you're watching "E.T.", with any real Earth government involved, events most likely wouldn't really have been allowed to end as beningnly as they did.  Sometimes a movie just goes past the 'larger than life' mark and becomes larger than reality.  "Superman Returns" is one of those movies.<br /><br />  Watching this, you believe it all.  You care about the characters, and you Know the characters.  It's exhilirating,  humorous, emotionally moving, inspirational, dramatic and forever memorable.<br /><br />  Apparantly set more or less in the continuity of the previous live-action Superman movies, the Man Of Steel returns to Earth after a five-year abscence off in space seeking out the remnants of his homeworld Krypton in hopes of some trace of survivors.  The world he comes back to seems darker, more violent, and more desperate than the one he left; just like the world of today seems darker, more violent, and more desperate than the world of years ago (or, more likely, we're just in general more aware of the more distressing aspects of our planet nowadays).  Superman's actual return to the public eye is one of the most stunning moments in movie history.<br /><br />  By one of the above-mentioned coincidences, his return comes at the same time Lex Luthor is putting into play his biggest and most ambitious plan to date.  The Luthor of "Superman Returns" occupies a midway point between the entertaining but too-buffoonish Luthor of the earlier live-action movies, and the deadly believable, genius behind-the-scenes manipulator of the books; I would have voted to go far closer to the comic book version but the incarnation presented here turns out to be extremely effective after all (over-the-top masterplans and all) thanks in part to a fantastic performance by Kevin Spacey.  Perry White (the chief editor at the Daily Planet) is quite different here in both appearance and mannerisms but comes off very well also, with Frank Langella doing a great job in the role.  Lois Lane, as played by Kate Bosworth, is pretty close to the comics version but actually, in my opinion, a bit Better of a character than she often is in the comics, and she seems more indispensable to the Superman mythos than in previous adaptations.  The new, created-for-the-movie, characters, come off great and add tremendously to the film.  And Brandon Routh proves to be worthy into stepping into the lead role and living up to 68 years of glorious Superman history; he does a great job of synthesizing the feel of the 'classic' Superman from years past and the 'modern', post-Crisis On Infinte Earths (a DC comics crossover from the mid 80s) incarnation of a more believable and detailed Superman and DC Universe in general.<br /><br />  I hope they do ten more of these (bring on Darkseid!).  Awesome in every regard, "Superman Returns" defines the term 'movie magic'.</p></body></html>

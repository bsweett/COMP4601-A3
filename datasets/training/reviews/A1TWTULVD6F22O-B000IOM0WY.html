<meta name="summary" content="Great heist movie, sappy ending...."></head><body><p>"The Italian Job" is a remake of a classic, but under F. Gary Gray's direction, is surprisingly crisp and well-paced.  No need to detail the plot--revenge of criminals on one of their own, who stole from them.  <p>The cast is a great ensemble with the only cast members in break out roles, being the 3 Mini-Coopers featured in the film.  No doubt this will be a BMW Sales Bonanza for the cheeky little Brit auto.  Character development is secondary to the heist and the action, as it should be...too little of the film is in Venice and too much in LA, but what can you do?<p>The music is a refreshing mix, there are laughs sprinkled throughout & enough action for all but the youngest adrenaline jockies.  A sappy ending...they should have stuck with pictures of each of the heist members surrounded by their gold, and called it quits.<p>Definitely worth seeing on the big screen, and again in DVD, where it promises to have some great special effects!</p></body></html>

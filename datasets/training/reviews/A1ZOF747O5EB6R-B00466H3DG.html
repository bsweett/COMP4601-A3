<meta name="summary" content="Carrey's Hype Precedes Him"></head><body><p>I would be telling untruths if I were to say that I enjoyed this film.  Regrettably, it did not live up to my expectations.  This view being despite the fact that its screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman, was responsible for "Being John Malkovich", a wonderfully magic yet funny film that I rate very highly.  "Spotless Mind" is a very different film in that it tried to take itself much too seriously.<br /><br />Over the years, it has been my observation that Jim Carrey, the lead in "Spotless Mind", is more highly regarded in America than he is elsewhere.  Americans seem to regard him as a genius while non-Americans see him as largely a slapstick actor.  I fall into this latter category.  Carrey's role is not one of humour in this role, yet he still fails to capture the imagination.  His hype precedes him.<br /><br />In brief, the film covers a process whereby one's immediate memory of a particular person or event can be erased.  Carrey's girlfriend, played by Kate Winslet, has the procedure down to eradicate Carrey (Joel) from her memory.  In retaliation, Joel does the same for his girlfriend.  In the middle of the process, however, he has second thoughts and tries to reverse or evade the changes.  He desperately tries to cling to his lover.  His memories become precious.  Identity tries to override deceit and revenge.<br /><br />I am very glad that I have now seen this film if only to understand other people's views.  However, I am unable to encourage others to follow my lead.</p></body></html>

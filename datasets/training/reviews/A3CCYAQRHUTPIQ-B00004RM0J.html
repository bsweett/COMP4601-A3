<meta name="summary" content="AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH"></head><body><p>Everybody of a certain age (23-26 or so) will have seen this film at the cinema, or on television already. One of those Steven Speilberg films that wasn't actually directed by him (see also: 'Gremlins', 'Poltergeist', and  so forth), it features a gang of kids who shout constantly until you want  to torture them to death. And Corey Feldman (not Haim), too.<p>It's not as  good as you remember - action-wise, it doesn't get into gear until about  half-way through, and the kids are really, really irritating. It resembles  a less-expensive version of 'Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom', and  that was always the lesser of the Indy films.<p>Still, it passes a wet  boxing day well, and it's horrifying to think that, in a decade from now, a  futuristic version of me will only have 'Pokemon: The First Movie' to write  about.</p></body></html>

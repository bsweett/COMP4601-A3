<meta name="summary" content="Insomnia"></head><body><p>An intriguing, top-notch reworking of a Norwegian psychological thriller by "Memento" director Christopher Nolan, "Insomnia" gets a lot of mileage out of its picturesque Alaskan setting, since constant Northern daylight is the trigger for Dormer's sleepless (and guilt-ridden) nights. Pacino excels as the tortured cop whose error in judgment lands him in a cat-and-mouse game with his suspect, chillingly played by Williams. With strong support from Donovan and Swank (as a gung-ho rookie cop on the case), and a fabulous chase sequence on floating logs, this moody, gripping film will keep you wide awake.</p></body></html>

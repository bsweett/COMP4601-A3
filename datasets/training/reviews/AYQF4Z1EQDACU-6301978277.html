The 1959 farse about the two musicians Joe and Jerry, who disquise themselves as women under the names Josephine and Daphne to land jobs as the sax and bow fidle in an all girls jazz band.Where they meet gorgeous songbird Sugar Kane. Also where Daphne meets womanizer Osgood Fielding III.When Daphne is stuck with that &quot;dirty old man&quot; Joe(Curtis) borrows a cup of that sugar(Monroe)as the millionare of Sugar's dreams &quot;Shell Oil Junior&quot;. If Your looking for a classic comedy this is a good one. It's AFI's number 1 laugh, or if you want more marilyn, you love her in this one and if your looking for more Curtis and Lemmon they're hysterical in this one. See this classic comedy and you'll get &quot;the sweet end of the lolly pop&quot;. As Osgood said at the end &quot;nobody's perfect&quot; well thats true ,but Some like it Hot may be a perfect comedy and as Sugar sang &quot;I'm through with love, well she's not through for long ,but We are not through with this movie, because we love this film so much and we all want to &quot;borrow a cup of that sugar&quot; every time we watch it, &quot;ZOWIE&quot; &quot;Yeah real hot&quot;</p></body></html>

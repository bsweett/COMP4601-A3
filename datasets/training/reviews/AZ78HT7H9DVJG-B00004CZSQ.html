<meta name="summary" content="definitely a classic..."></head><body><p>Dario Argento is the German version of Alfred Hitchcock.  *Suspiria* is one of the best horror/thriller films that I've seen, even though it was made in the 70's.<br /><br />Susy is a young American dancer who has flown to Germany to attend one of the best ballet schools in the world.  Upon arrival in a dark stormy night, Susy immediately faces drama at the door.  A young woman opens the front door and shouts something back and disappears...only to be murdered later.<br /><br />Almost right at the beginning, Susy doesn't feel right at the school.  She's fainting, getting nosebleeds and hearing strange noises outside her room.  She isn't the only one...another dancer hears them as well.<br /><br />All of this is building up for a surprise ending.  If you really pay attention throughout the movie, you could probably guess what the surprise is.<br /><br />I love the props, especially the wallpapers, and the lighting throughout the movie.  They were really eye catching.  I have a feeling that the wallpapers inspired *Lucky Number Slevin* because the same thing is seen in this movie.<br /><br />Anyways, I liked *Suspiria* even though some parts can be a little corny.  Nonetheless, it's entertaining.</p></body></html>

This is one diabolical plot and as usual the characters are very clever, the set-ups inventive, and the animation jaw-dropping.<br /><br />The Toy Story series, like most animation these days (Dreamworks, Blue Sky, Sony), highly references classic movies and pop culture. The difference with these three films is that it all supports strong characters who earn their keep. This third film expands upon the same type of mawkishness from the "Jessie" elements in the second installment, deepening its premise with an utterly sinister, fascinating villain who should be the envy of screenwriters everywhere. I was pretty amazed at the undiluted portrayal of evil, so much that I would really hesitate showing this to any kid under seven or eight years old. It was a bit extreme.<br /><br />The creative team also relies way too much on slathering on the emotion with a spatula -- something that I think was done with much more sophistication and delicacy in most of the classic Disney films. However, the issues and emotions they are dealing with do run very deep in all of us, and they tap into a huge reservoir of childhood memories and (somewhat shamelessly) run with it.</p></body></html>

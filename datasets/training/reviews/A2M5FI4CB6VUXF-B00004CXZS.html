Wrath of Khan is not just a STEP up, it is a LEAP up.... it is LEAPS AND BOUNDS above its predecessor and dare I say the movies that followed.<br /><br />None of the series of movies had this level of conflict, tension and emotion. None had this amount of action and NONE... NOT ONE of them... had Ricardo Montalban!</p></body></html>

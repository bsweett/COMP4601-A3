<meta name="summary" content="A very mixed bag"></head><body><p>First off I have to point out that while I was not a fan of the original X-men that came out in 2000 I was a huge fan of the second in the franchise.  This film, while it raises interesting philosophical questions falls well short of my expectations.<br /><br />Its not that the story is a bad story it just promised too much and delivered too little.  The special effects are great but there are plot holes in the movie that are big enough to drive a train through.<br /><br />The acting is all over the map<br /><br />Hugh Jackman<br /><br />....  Logan/Wolverine<br /><br />Halle Berry<br /><br />....  Ororo Munroe/Storm<br /><br />Ian McKellen<br /><br />....  Eric Lensherr/Magneto<br /><br />These three perform well especially Mckellen who always manages to snatch an acting victory from the jaws of defeat.  The rest of the cast is hardly given any screen time at all.<br /><br />Even though its been 4 years since the last one came out the story feels half baked.  They needed more time to nail it all down.  At times it felt like there were 2 or 3 separate storylines.<br /><br />Overall-I hope everyone connected with this project counts their blessings and just go their separate ways.  This movie is not exactly a high note but it is a good place to end it.  I really wanted to like this movie like I did X2.  I never could quite manage it.</p></body></html>

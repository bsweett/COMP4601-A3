I think Angelina Jolie is the only one that got it right on 'Beyond Borders', but this film takes Aussie Nicole Kidman and places her in the UN, where the poor thing is supposed to convince us that she can speak a variety of languages.<br /><br />The problem is, Nicole sounds like she's speaking Australian English even when shes speaking Swahili, which obviously isn't a good thing. The high power star cast does nothing to clarify the confusing, meandering plot, and by the time the end comes, you're left wondering why it is you're supposed to care. I had more fun watching the unintentionally hilarious 'Original Sin' starring Antonio Banderas.<br /><br />This film looks like it wanted an Oscar so badly, that they got the best director, and cinematographer to work on it. In the process, they forgot to concentrate on the script, and Nicole playing a South African who is 'patriotic' really got on my nerves. Why couldn't they cast a black actress in her role if they really cared? It would have made more sense. In the end, we get the feeling that this blonde, blue eyed beauty is some sort of Africa-loving philanthropist, and I didn't buy that.<br /><br />Next time, they should cast someone really good like Thandie Newton in a role like this, and respect the real crises that Africa is going through, instead of glossing it over and giving us guilt-ridden Caucasians in lead roles that so obviously belong to a black person.<br /><br />Even Two Stars is generous for this narcissistic mess.</p></body></html>

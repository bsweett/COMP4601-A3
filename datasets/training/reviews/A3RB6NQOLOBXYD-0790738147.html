<meta name="summary" content="Russel Crowe and GUY Pierce at their Best!!!"></head><body><p>I feel like i was one of the last people on Earth to see this movie. I finally saw it yesterday and i was blown away by the amazing performances by Guy Pierce, Russel Crowe, and Kevin Spacey. I especially like Russel Crowe's attitude in the movie, he plays a really tough cop (...). Guy Pierce plays as a cop too who rats some of his fellow officers in a police brutality event. L.A. Confidential is about a corrupt police prescient in the 1950's. A good story line with good quality action, especially from Russel Crowe. the ending has a good twist too. Might want to check this out!</p></body></html>

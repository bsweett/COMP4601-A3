<meta name="summary" content="Leave Keanu Reeves Alone!"></head><body><p>I am tired of everyone making fun of Keanu Reeves. Everyone calls him stupid and I can not disagree more. I think Keanu is actually a dark character or at least plays it well in this film. I don't know why there is so much hostility towards this man but I am writing this review to defend him and his acting. I actually think he acted pretty well in this movie, especially in the beginning of the movie where he takes the demon out of a poor girl. Keanu Reeves has good acting skills and actually played out this movie well. This movie's plot is what drew me to this film because it sounded interesting, even though I am not too religious and this movie is heavily drenched in religion. Yet it was played out good nonetheless. I was drawn to see what would happen at the end and it was not predictable. I like the alternative ending as well on the deleted scenes but definitely the first ending is better.<br /><br />Don't take what a lot of these reviewers said so personally, fellow reader. Keanu Reeves is not as bad as they make him sound. He is actually pretty good in this movie and made this film quite interesting. Honestly if there was a young exorcist I would imagine him to look a lot like Keanu, dark hair and all. The other actors aren't too bad either, I thought the person who played Gabriel was very interesting. I give this movie a solid four stars. Like the movie Stigmata was for me, it was good as a thriller, but too heavily religious for me to be five star. Still good though, and worth watching.</p></body></html>

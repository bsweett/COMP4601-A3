I didn't quite get what all the fuss was about: we all know that 50s horror movies like the original GODZILLA reflected something of the anxiety of the day re: nuclear weapons. Nobody was unduly concerned about the validity of the &quot;science&quot; behind such films. It was understood that these post-nuclear films were fantasies--giving expression to our most deep-seated fears perhaps, but not remotely to be interpreted as likely scenarios.<br /><br /> So watching Buzz Aldrin castigate DAT director Roland Emmerich and producer and co-writer Jerry Nachmanoff over the bad science and alarmist nature of their film on &quot;Deborah Norville&quot; seemed a bit of an overreaction itself. So much so, that I almost had to wonder if it wasn't all part of an elaborate promo campaign. What if the former astronaut was on the payroll, helping to stir up controversy and get people into theater. Nah! That could never happen in 21st century America.<br /><br /> After seeing the film, I was even more convinced that all the controversy may have been part of the pre-release hype. Of course, I have no doubt that Buzz Aldrin was sincere in his condemnation of the film's bad science, but his and others' overly earnest reactions certainly played right into the hands ot the promoters. Heck, it got me into the theater (well, that and the promise of incredible special effects). Had I waited longer to catch the general buzz (not Aldrin's), I might have decided it was probably NOT worth rushing out for, and I could at least wait for the DVD.<br /><br /> Because it really isn't a very good movie. By now, you've probably read all about the film's inconsistencies (dramatic AND meteorological), but you may still be under the impression that the special effects may make it worth seeing on the big screen. I was disappointed even on that score. The snowstorm in Bombay is a striking image--which lasts approximately 30 seconds. Same with the hail that seemingly devastates Tokyo (well, that may last a few seconds longer).<br /><br /> Actually, the CGI effects didn't impress me nearly as much as I had thought they might. Those twisters tearing through L.A. didn't look all that real to these jaded eyes. The flooding and freezing of NYC was perhaps a little more impressive...maybe too good though (and now we get back to the logic question). It's hard to imagine a meteorlogical scenario in which NYC would be totally devastated, while Washington, D.C. (some 230 miles away) would be relatively unscathed.<br /><br /> The political undercurrents you've heard about ARE there, but they don't really amount to all that much. Yes, it's VERY IRONIC that Norteamericanos are struggling to cross the Rio Grande INTO Mexico. There's some wit there. But I didn't really think the actor who played the vice president (Ken Welsh) looked that much like Dick Cheney. I thought he looked more like that spooky old Windom Earle from TWIN PEAKS. Wait a minute, Diane, that WAS spooky old Windom Earle from TWIN PEAKS. Now I am creeped out</p></body></html>

The opening shot of the community is hard to believe that it's not NYC!, but a back-lot at the studios where the picture was filmed. But this is more than just a film its Hitchcock's autobigraphical celluloid version of his life! Hitchcock wasn't a pleasent man, he was very sardonic and on several occasions was very cruel to the people who worked with him even going as far as to chain a camera man over night to a camera and give him coffee laced with ex lax before hand! Even the films characters are based on people he hated for instance in the film Burr looks ever so much like Selznick the notorious producer who brought Hitchcock over from England and watched over him with a hawks eye. But as it stand the film is a perfect thriller the only downer is Stewart with his shirt off!! Kelly looks amazing as usal though she was never the best actress in hollywood she was one of the best movie stars. Stewart plays a photographer stuck in a wheelchair with a broken leg. After time he becomes obsessed with the ongoing lives of his neighbors peering in on them with a zoom lensed camera. When he believes he witnessed a murder across the yard he tells his elitest girlfriend grace Kelly about it who in turn gets wrapped up in the world of voyeristic pleasure. The plot tsists and turns so tightly around the stroy that sweat and confusion pours out of your pours! The climax is jus eye popping! Flashes of color admist a darken room as teh suspected killer finally caomes out of the shadows to bump Stewart off! Hitchcock never takes you inside of the houses he leaves always on the outside looking in on everything. Rather it's a lonely woman trying to kill herself or a loose dance who has more male friends than all of New York City. hitchcock makes you look through Stewart lense and turns you not into Stewart but a pervert out for a night of arousal!</p></body></html>

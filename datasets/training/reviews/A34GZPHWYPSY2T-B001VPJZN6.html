<meta name="summary" content="Go back to MANHUNTER [insert vulgar cannibalistic slurping noise]"></head><body><p>Really! They had to remake <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0425228223">Red Dragon</a> with Sir Anthony Hopkins in order to make it "an official entry" in the "Hannibal series"?? Come off it people! MANHUNTER is the one and the only. This film is an insult to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CM1ICK">Manhunter [Blu-ray</a>] (the original film version of RED DRAGON, see my review) and really dismantles what was accomplished by it. That film of the mid-1980s changed the way cop films were made.<br /><br />Here we have the sickening Tooth Fairy (Ralph Fiennes), a pathetic Will Graham (Ed Norton who is forever being confused with the equally abominable Ed Burns), and a super-sick flashback to an earlier Hannibal. Strangely, Hopkins' rendition of Hannibal, though a Maryland native, in this film has a totally Anthony Hopkins accent. As one reviewer of the period said, Hopkins didn't even bother to change his accent the way he did in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.<br /><br />Graham was injured by Lecktor (MANHUNTER spelling!), true. He was slick but recall that Graham visited Lecktor in jail to discuss the Tooth Fairy--Graham had already captured Lecktor. Ah, forget it, the rest of this thing is really a waste, a greedy attempt rather than praise for the novels. Watch it if you must but don't say you weren't warned: this is pretty stupid overall.<br /><br />Now MANHUNTER is a work of unparalleled genius!</p></body></html>

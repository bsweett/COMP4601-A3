<meta name="summary" content="Well made adaption of Dick short story"></head><body><p>I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan. He plays to the media too much. I've believed for some time that he's more like the character he plays in Magnolia than the nice guy he pretends to be. So the character he plays in Minority Report is perfect for him; he's a flawed hero with a drug problem. <p>Tinsel Town has had a crush on Philip K. Dick for the past twenty or so years. Blade Runner was the first--and one of the best (despite a very flawed script)adaptions of Dick's paranoid world view. Phil Dick's stories have always been about the psychology and motivation of the characters (and well developed plots) more than spaceships and the future. That's why, perhaps, his stories have endured. Total Recall, Screamers and Imposter all had their moments (the best moments were from Dick's original stories).<p>Minority Report stands as probably the sharpest adaption of both Dick's work and world view. It's pretty darn violent and the script (despite a major plot flaw) well written. It's your typical Spielberg production--suspenseful and well thought out (for the most part). The casting is great although some of it, again, is a bit predictable which makes the ending a bit easy to foresee (ironic isn't it?)<p>The plot in a nutshell--in the future precogs (people who can see the possible futures) can predict who will be murdered and by whom. The police arrest the prep prior to the crime thus preventing the crime from occuring. Cruise is one these elite officers and one of the founders of this specialized police force. He's on their side until he is apparently--somehow--framed for a murder of someone he has never met. Suddenly, Cruise is on the run out to discover who framed him and why. (SPOILER ALERT)There's also another unsolved murder that may or may not have something to do with his case.<p>Cruise attempts to elude the very people he trained and worked with to prove his innocence. A typical Hitchcock (and Dick) theme--the innocent man framed and on the run. In many respects, Minority Report plays as a 02 version of Hitch's own North By Northwest (and there are some witty visual references to Hitch's film as well as those Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and other sf films).<p>Minority Report is a rewarding two hour ride with both heart and soul. The story is solid and well thought out (although, again, with a significant flaw). It's also a demonstration of Speilberg's new found maturity as a film director. He couldn't have possibly made this adult, mature film ten or even five years ago. He had the skill but not the soul for it. I'd highly recommend this fine film.</p></body></html>

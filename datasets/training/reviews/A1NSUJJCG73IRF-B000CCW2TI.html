<meta name="summary" content="Red Eye  (2005)"></head><body><p>Director:  Wes Craven<br /><br />Cast:  Rachel McAdams, Cillian Murphy, Brian Cox, Jayma Mays, Angela Paton, Laura Johnson, Suzie Plakson, Max Kasch, Jack Salia.<br /><br />Running Time:  85 minutes<br /><br />Rated PG-13 for some intense sequences of violence, and language.<br /><br />"Red Eye" is enjoyable nonsense that would be other wise be unbearable rubbish were it not for the two excellent leads, their chemistry and paced direction from that old pro Craven ("The Last House on the Left"). The plot is an entirely twist less piece of fluff and the script is equally lacking in complexity and depth.  Lisa (Rachel McAdams) Reisert is a people-pleaser; she works at a hotel, where most of her life revolves around. But when her grandmother dies, and as Lisa prepares to fly home taking the red eye, she meets Jackson (Cillian Murphy), a seemingly charming man whom she encounters not once, but twice before her plane boards only to find that she is seated in the seat next to Jackson's. Moments after takeoff, Jackson drops his act and reveals himself as a man who is involved in a plan to kill the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security, and it's Lisa who must set the plan into action... or else her father will be murdered. And at 30,000 feet, there's no where to run and nowhere to get help.<br /><br />This is where Craven's film really takes flight (so to speak), becoming a gripping and edgy claustrophobic suspense thriller in the mould of Hitchcock, while making perceptive use of intruding close up shots to penetrate the audience deep within the heroine's estranged predicament. Told she must make an air phone call in order to move a political figure closer to death's door, or else her Father will be appropriately bumped off, Rachel frustrates in her attempts to play Rippner at his own game. Whilst on board there's a comical array of Airport type passengers who unintentionally complicate Rippner's decadent ploy: stand outs include a voluptuous middle aged women, who constantly seeks Rippner's assistance with her overhead luggage, a friendly but interfering old lady, (reminiscent of Helen Hayes in "Airport 1970") and a resourceful beady-eyed child on her first flight.  But its Cillian Murphy's slanderous turn as Rippner - his unusually chiseled features and watery blue eyes used at first to charm, then terrorize Rachel in a sadistic turn of malevolence - that dominates the screen with a cool and creeping exterior presence. McAdams also fairs well in the resourceful heroine role, forced to flex her action muscles once the ball slides into her court, while successfully anchoring the film into believability with her homely emanation.<br /><br />Once the pivotal flight sequence is over however Craven is on disappointingly familiar stalk and slash territory, as Rachel proceeds to run from a now vocally impaired Rippner, (metaphorically morphed into a monstrous persona -a sly nod to Craven's Freddy Kruger creation), with the film beginning to lose some of its momentum following a predictable array of genre cliques, which finds Rachel becoming trapped inside her family home armed with hockey stick, with the sinister Rippner lurking around somewhere in typical psycho killer defiance.  On the whole "Red Eye" remains an engrossing if routine thriller, which should banish memories of Craven's recent disastrous werewolf outing "Cursed", while keeping you buckled to your seat with high-octane tension.  Craven is obviously starting to get away from his teeny-bopping, "let's make the big bucks" thrillers ("Scream"," Cursed") and has decided to lean toward films that made him famous in the first place ("The Hills Have Eyes"," A Nightmare on Elm Street") with "Red Eye".  Although it lacks characterization and has some plot mishaps, it is a deadly serious thriller that doesn't have tongue-in-cheek humor or cater to pre-teen audiences-it's goal is to just flat out scare you with its shocking (used very loosely here) twists and intense reality and while it only moderately succeeds in these departments, at least it was an adequate effort back into the realm of serious thrills and chills.</p></body></html>

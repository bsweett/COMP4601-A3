<meta name="summary" content="The one they should have started with!"></head><body><p>This is the movie that the Star Trek motion pictures should have started with.  It was a perfect place to pick up and continue a story line.  After all, Kirk has more enemies than all the tribbles in the galaxy.  There is plenty of action alongside comedy relief.  And yes, the uniforms are much better in this film than in TMP!<br /><br />Even if you've never watched an episode of Star Trek you will be able to follow the story well.  This is a must have for Star Trek fans of all ages.  Montalban gives an excellent performance even though quite a few years have gone by since he orignated his role and he's obviously kept himself in good shape despite his chronic back problems.<br /><br />The acting is much better here than TMP.  Everyone actually looks as if they are glad to be on the set.  And why shouldn't they be?  One little t.v. show has brought them more dough than they ever thought they'd see.<br /><br />You'll enjoy this one.  Live long and prosper!!</p></body></html>

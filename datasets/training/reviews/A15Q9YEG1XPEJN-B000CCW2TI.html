Rachel McAdams does good "smart girl in peril".<br /><br />As I watched this film, I was reminded of Hitchcock and "Dial M for Murder". I think the two films are very much alike in a couple of ways, not in all.<br /><br />First of all, McAdams is not a weak woman, whereas Grace Kelly's character was. However, both are women who are wooed by unscrupulous men and fall for it.<br /><br />Second, Cillian Murphy is a charming pretty boy who turns on a dime to become one heck of an evil guy. Ray Milland is a charming guy who turns out to be evil too.<br /><br />Finally, the movie does Hitchcock proud. It sets us up for the events to come by letting us believe that we are witnessing one thing, only to turn everything all around and mix it up.<br /><br />Wes Craven, the film's director, is NOT known for subtlety, which is why this film is all the more interesting. Craven actually takes his time developing his characters and delivers a sinister plotline with care and timing. His previous films have been horror and gorefest films that were as subtle as a sledge hammer.<br /><br />Craven does a darned good Hitchcock imitation. Murphy and McAdams deliver darned good performances.<br /><br />Personal note that has nothing to do with the review: McAdams and Murphy are not Kelly or Milland and Craven is not Hitchcock. Somehow, Milland and Kelly managed to provide a depth of character that this film's stars don't quite deliver. I don't know how to put my finger on it, and it's really not so much a criticism of this film as it is a yearning for the the actors of the 30's through the 50's. They just did it a bit better, in my opinion. Watching Dial M for Murder, you can just see the wheels turning in the people's heads as they think through what has gone before. Also there was just a higher degree of terror when Kelly is attacked. Was it Hitchcock's direction or the actors or was it both? I don't know how to discern that. Regardless, there is no one out there today that can do a real thriller like this very well. Craven has done a stand up job and I think this film warrants four stars.</p></body></html>

This Sylvester Stallone bloodfest exists in its own cinematic universe - functioning as a graphic journey into Burmese carnage. At least Stallone keeps things moving while bullets, bombs and bodies fly in all directions. The 90-minute running time adds to the B-movie atmosphere. Thanks for the memories, Sly, but enough already.</p></body></html>

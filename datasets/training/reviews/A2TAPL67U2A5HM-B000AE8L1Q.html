<meta name="summary" content="The Upside of Anger"></head><body><p>The Upside of Anger~ Joan Allen is a misnomer for this picture as it should have been called the upside of tedium. The movie is supposedely under 2 hours but it sure feels like one is watching it for 2 weeks, months or even years. Kevin Costner is ok in his role but the rest of the cast seemingly mail in their performances. The story line is alright but implodes at the end and the ending is kind of lame and predictable. It is strange to say this since Costner sure has made his sure of really bad and horrid movies over the years, but he is the star of this mediocre flick and prevents me from giving it one star. I was espcially perplexed that Keri Russel does such a lame job but the character that she was given was also paper thin so she did what she could with a bad part. This movie is tedious, boring, long and lame but still not so bad that it gets one star, but two stars is just what it deserves.</p></body></html>

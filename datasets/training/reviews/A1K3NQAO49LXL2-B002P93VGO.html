<meta name="summary" content="Yes, hard to believe that Wolverine would be this bad..."></head><body><p>I heard that this movie was terrible, but I couldn't believe it. "Hey, it's Hugh Jackman, it's Wolverine, how bad could it be?" Well, it was pretty bad. The best thing about it was the opening sequence and the credits, and it just went downhill from there. What was anybody's motive for doing anything at all? It just didn't make any sense. What's all this nonsense about having a battle on the narrow concrete ledge on the top of a nuclear power plant cooling tower? Why does Scott Summers need to show up? Horrible on all counts. They are already talking about a "reboot" of the "series" only a few years in. Awful.</p></body></html>

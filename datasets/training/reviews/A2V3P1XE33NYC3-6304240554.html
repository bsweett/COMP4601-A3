Personally, I have watched this film several times over the years and by this point have little idea of which versions I have seen or enjoyed the most. I am a viewer who always likes to see the uncut, unedited version of any movie because I do not enjoy the idea of someone else deciding what I can or cannot see. How many versions of this film exist? At least four, I think, although I'm sure there are more.  O.K., censors will do what censors do and we can do little about it except shake our heads and look for an uncut foreign version. But let's acknowledge something important about the numerous versions of this film and the movie's central theme. Romero used this installment of his zombie franchise to critique the rampant consumerism in American society, right? Isn't it more than a bit ironic there are so many versions of this film? In other words, a movie excoriating uncontrolled materialism requires fans to continually go out and buy the latest updated version. I'd laugh if it weren't so ridiculous.<br /><br />Anyway, here we go. The mysterious plague, event, or whatever it is that caused the dead to rise in the first film has now become global in its implications. Mass chaos breaks out across the United States and presumably the world. Television stations broadcast emergency information that usually results in more harm than help, and the police and military services fight a losing battle in areas loaded with the shambling dead. A tense series of showdowns in an infested apartment complex show the seriousness of the problem. Not only do you have flesh-seeking zombies to worry about, citizens going nuts and shooting at the cops become a real problem as well. It's obvious civilization teeters on the brink of utter collapse, so media personality Fran (Gayleen Ross), her boyfriend and chopper pilot Stephen (David Emge), and two police officers involved in the failed raid on the apartment building, Roger (Scott Reinger) and Peter (Ken Foree), decide to fly the friendly skies to anywhere but the city. They run into a few problems along the way, such as a pitched battle with a bunch of zombies near a refueling depot out in the countryside, but the quartet eventually achieves some sense of safety when they hole up in a huge shopping mall out in the sticks.<br /><br />As the four set up shop in the mall, they have to go about a series of housecleaning chores. Romero treats us to lengthy scenes of Scott and Peter loping around the mall making sure the place is safe. We see the two cops running through stores, avoiding zombies all the way, to gather supplies. They discover a storage room tucked away in the rear of the mall and work to turn it into a base of operations. Scott and Peter even risk life and limb (pun intended) to drive huge big rigs up to the doors of the mall, thus effectively blocking the shambling dead from entering the building. Then the bloodletting begins as the group raids a gun shop and promptly exterminates every flesh eater in the mall. These scenes, while lengthy and seemingly mundane in the context of the larger picture, actually serve an important purpose. By showing our heroes setting up shop in the mall, Romero helps give the film a sense of civilization attempting to rebuild itself. And with the resumption of civilization, apparently, comes the greedy materialism inherent in modern life. Fran, Stephen, Scott, and Peter soon spend most of their time shopping and enjoying the exquisite goods available in the various shops. By the time a motley motorcycle gang appears on the scene to plunder the mall (led by Tom Savini!), a three way battle erupts between our heroes, the thugs, and the zombies now allowed to once again roam through the mall.<br /><br />Romero's second installment of his famed Dead Trilogy is such a wonder to behold due to several important factors. The materialism theme steals most of the attention because, frankly, it's great to see someone add such depth to a nihilistic horror film. I appreciated the gore that, although infrequent, really makes an impact when it pops up. You've got zombies munching on victuals in gluey close up, a grotesque tete a tete (heh!) with helicopter blades, lots of exploding heads, and a bunch of motorcycle pirates coming apart at the seams. Even more amazing is the black humor infusing this fantastic film. For instance, have you ever seen a pie fight involving reanimated, decaying corpses? You will here. "Dawn of the Dead" can't get any better, right? Wrong. That's Goblin you hear performing the score for the film. Yep, Romero got the group responsible for so many of Dario Argento's creepy film scores to do the soundtrack for "Dawn of the Dead." In fact, Dario helped out with this film. Simply amazing. Fans couldn't put together a dream lineup like this if they tried.<br /><br />I'm not going to mention extras except to say each of the different versions contains different stuff. I see there is now an "Ultimate Edition" set that contains so many extras as to boggle the mind. I'm wondering if I should just buy the ultimate collection and be done with it because I've avoided buying any version. Frankly, I don't appreciate the greed involved in the distribution of this film. Romero followed this film up with the awesomely gory "Day of the Dead," another must see classic in the horror canon. Enjoy!</p></body></html>

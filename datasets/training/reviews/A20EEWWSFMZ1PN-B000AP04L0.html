<meta name="summary" content="I am writing this from an office cubical."></head><body><p>Current events mixed with old tales and office lure mix to create one of the best comedies around. This film along with the red Swingline stapler had achieved cult status.<br /><br />As I look around (and stand up) I can see all the personalities depicted in this movie. If anyone wanted to see a movie that mimic like real life this one is it and maybe "Joe Versus the Volcano" (1990) 0790741393. This is much more real than "9 to 5" (1980) ASIN: 6300247236.<br /><br />Just a moment while I expand my cube. (*&*%$#%$&*)<br /><br />There now where was I? Oh yes, Jennifer Aniston shows her flash.<br /><br />It is interesting that the film was made in Austin and Dallas where I am writing this. It must be a sign on some sort.<br /><br />You will see the old story of skimming percentages of a cent off of transactions with a new twist.<br /><br />I have to go now the copier is calling!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001REZM6K">Marley and Me (Single-Disc Edition)</a></p></body></html>

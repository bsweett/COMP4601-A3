<meta name="summary" content="GREAT MOVIE ,BUT NOT DVD!!!"></head><body><p>I really liked and loved this movie. And I knew when comes to DVD, I would buy it for sure for my DVD collection ,but this DVD very simple and plain. Not double disk or DTS or nothing an all...if u really love this movie like I did,Wait a while till end the year I am VERY SURE they going to come with DTS or Superbit Or Dir cut,I am going to wait for sure to get the whole McCoy. These days they do that with most movies, Then after few months they come up with all loaded stuffs on DVD.</p></body></html>

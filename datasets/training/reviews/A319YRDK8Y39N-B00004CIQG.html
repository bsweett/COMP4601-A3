<meta name="summary" content="Kubrick's fantastic take on black comedy"></head><body><p>There is one apparent similarity between all of Stanley Kubrick&#65533;s films, and that is everyone of them is very different then the rest. Dr. Strangelove is no exception as his only comedy, and it works on nearly every level.<p>Dr. Strangelove is considered by many as one of his best works. While I don&#65533;t necessarily place it as high on that list, it is still an excellent dark comedic look at nuclear threat. The story jumps back and forth between a number of characters as an insane general gives his planes orders to drop nukes on the Soviet Union in an unprovoked attack while the rest of the nation scrambles to put a stop to it. <p>Probably the most apparent success in this film is the excellent acting by Peter Sellers in three different roles (the president, a British officer, and the eccentric Dr. Strangelove), as well as wonderful performances by George C. Scott, Slim Pickens and the rest of the cast. Sellers nails each of his characters, adding much of their comedic wit. Many of his funniest lines were improved, such as a hilarious phone call to the drunken Russian president. Kubrick managed to bring out top-notch acting all around here. Also, the fantastic sets are amazing, especially the gigantic War Room set comprised of a gigantic round table and three huge panels depicting the world looming over it. Kubrick shows his photographic roots as well in the stunning cinematography of many of his scenes. Characters and objects are juxtaposed in visually pleasing and symbolic ways, and often reveal visual gags.<p>Much of the humor, as is often the case with black comedy, is easily missed if your not paying attention. In fact, this film definitely favors repeat viewings. Each time I watch it, I notice a few more jokes hidden throughout the film. But the suspense also builds along with the humor as the world&#65533;s situation becomes more and more desperate.<p>The only flaws in Dr. Strangelove seem to be its slow beginning which doesn&#65533;t offer much humor, and a few minor production value problems such as jump cuts and poor audio transitions, most of which can be contributed to filmmaking conditions of the time.<p>This is definitly worth checking out if you like black comedies, or love the visual and symbolic style of Kubrick.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="slightly disappointing"></head><body><p>First on the cast: Love Kevin Spacey as Lex and Parker Posey as Kitty. Brandon Routh's physionomy bears uncanny resemblance to all other actors ever in the role of the Superman. Kate Bosworth BORING Lois Lane (but then again, Teri Hatcher is the only L. Lane who's not an annoying loser of a chick).<br />Special effects extremely obvious.<br />And now to the really disappointing bit - it is, beyond doubt, the script. Superboy portrayed as lovesick stalker (guess L. Lane is not married to the man she lives with to keep Superman's shmoozing with Lane politically correct?!). Cryptonite embedded in the crystal soil cripples him and brings him to brink of death on one occasion, but a lil later he pulls it out of the earth's core and launches it into space almost unaffected? L. Lane in Luthor's boat locked in the pantry with her son and they sit opposite each other on the floor? Huh??! What sort of a mother is that? But a lil later she dives into the ocean to save the Superguy (and leaves her husband in the plane, looking like a moron). She pulls a 105 kilo guy from the water like its nothing? Then she marches to Superman's hospital bed like the celebrity she is not (and she is NOT Superman's relative). Its so annoying! They could have done a better job at it. 4 stars only cuz I am a fan.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I was too hard on this film in the theater."></head><body><p>First, let me state I dislike about two thirds of the classic, Deep Space Nine, Voyager, and Enterprise content out there.  Still, I'll watch them, because scene to scene they have their moments and there are some very stellar (no pun intended) episodes scattered throughout.<br /><br />Next, I want to dis this film for some legitimate reasons.  To have Wil Weaton in the reception scene sitting next to his mom and then not use him in any other part of the film was ridiculous.<br /><br />I'm geeking out here, but considering Tasha Yar's daughter is Romulan, you'd think we'd encounter her as one of the Romulan commanders later in the film.  Since this is the final "future" Trek film, that would have been fitting to get all the cast members in.  How did they miss that one?<br /><br />The scene with Data and Picard in his Ready Room drinking wine and speaking of human ritual & bonds (I think that's what it was, it's been a while) should not have been cut. It's essential for both showing the audience more of the friendship between those two, the significant of the Chateau Picard wine toasted later in the film, and the poignancy of Data's sacrifice.  That cut was not only unnecessary, but detrimental to the film's arc.  Forget the "tempo", "momentum", or "rhythm" of the film.  We're not talking action scenes, here.<br /><br />The bat imagery and inspiration was a bit, how do I put this mildly, overt.  No, that's too kind.  It was beating me over the head with a big, dead, stinky bat, like some junior high student short story's grand creative stroke.  Less is more, folks.<br /><br />Finally, my biggest issue in the film, and one I probably let get in the way of my enjoyment of it, was the whole WMD, terrorism, and pro-Iraq invasion slant I perceived.  Now, the virgin terrorist bent on world domination with an awful WMD is something clearly Spiner and friends intended in the script.  The Iraq part was probably just my distaste with what was happening in the media at the time being unjustifiably channeled into the viewing.  I can't be sure, but I suspect that was unintentional and was just some bad luck in the timing of the film's release.  But, hey, maybe my first instincts were right.<br /><br />Nonetheless, like I said, I was too harsh on the film in the theater.  I was fuming, pissed even.  For the seeming Iraq slant, for Data's sudden death without the proper preparation and arc, for the soft, overly-groomed (common recent Trek problem), cheesy-looking Romulan Senate cgi scenes.  However, in retrospect, and especially considering that one scene I mentioned previously that should not have been cut, I think the film is mostly in the right place.  The ship to ship battle sequence at the end is masterful, combining all the techniques originated in the earliest TNG video games and novels, giving realistic division-of-tasks on the bridge, and presenting the events with a "truthiness" (finally, a use for that word!).  They were 3D, dynamic, nuanced, and believable within the established rules and technologies of this franchise.<br /><br />The short-hand and camaraderie between this troop of actors is here in full force.  I think they're right up there with the cast of MASH, quite frankly, and I'd put these actors in an echelon above that due to the serious and challenging subject matter they've dealt with over the years, not to mention the films. I really can't think of any other ensemble that's of this caliber, each and every one of them.  I'm still not certain the best aura of the series was ever captured in any of the films, but in this one I almost felt they arrived at something more.  Some of the kidding was put aside.  Not all, but more than most of the episodes and films.  There was a mature professionalism exuded by the characters.  Individuals well into the prime of their professional and personal lives, dealing with the threats, changes, growth, and loses life entails.<br /><br />The film's look, I have to point out before wrapping this up, is gorgeous.  The Romulan senate has that awful overly-groomed thing going on, like I said.  In the rest of the film, however, the textures, lighting, pure white lights to subtle colors, those lens flares, the fascinating hue of Data's skin and eyes...often all of this happening at the same time!  A feast for the peepers.  This is without a doubt not only the finest-looking Star Trek outing, but a striking visual achievement, by any standard.  It is not a five star film in my book, but in my opinion it was worth another look.  I know I'll be returning to it some more.  With reservations, but worthy nonetheless.</p></body></html>

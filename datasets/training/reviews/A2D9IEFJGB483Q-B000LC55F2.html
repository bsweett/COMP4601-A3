<meta name="summary" content="If you loved the edgier episodes of "The Twilight Zone" . . ."></head><body><p>If you are a fan of Steam Punk (Verne-Wells Victorian Sci-Fi, "The Wild, Wild, West"), or love the edgier episodes of "The Twilight Zone," then you will love the movie.<br /><br />It is essentially a psychodrama about a rivalry and obsession that goes out of control.  The distinct difference is that this is a Steam Punk Victorian Era, which is only revealed at the end of the movie, and various Christophers associated with this project (writer, director) used the rivalry of magicians as the friction-point.<br /><br />About one-third of the way through, my heart was broken because I could tell there were no heroes in the move. This is a credit to all involved, since it illustrates the point that obsession, rivalry, and revenge are like an oil slick: everyone is left greasy and dirty.  Even the mentors who should have known better are dingy.<br /><br />Additionally, the non-linear flashback/flash forward added to the theme.  What we see is one odd lump of humanity. Again, this lumpiness reminds us of the sad results of obsession, rivalry, and revenge.<br /><br />I do have one criticism.  Tesla was portrayed as being cautious toward science.  This is inaccurate.  Even at this stage in his life, he still had a burning passion for science. His autobiography begins with these words, "The progressive development of man is vitally dependent on invention. It is the most important product of his creative brain. Its ultimate purpose is the complete mastery of mind over the material world, the harnessing of the forces of nature to human needs. This is the difficult task of the inventor who is often misunderstood and unrewarded. But he finds ample compensation in the pleasing exercises of his powers and in the knowledge of being one of that exceptionally privileged class without whom the race would have long ago perished in the bitter struggle against pitiless elements."<br /><br />Read "Tesla: Man Out Of Time" for a more accurate description of the Wizard of Colorado Springs.<br /><br />Note: The ending almost left with a feeling of deus ex machine, but after reviewing this film--it is shuffled like "Citizen Kane"--I realized there were enough clues and proper set up for the semi-surprise ending.<br /><br />PS--and yes, seeing Wolverine, Batman, Gollum, and Ziggy Stardust in one film makes it worth seeing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I Didn't Think It Could Be Done..."></head><body><p>...usually I HATE it when a classic story is &quot;updated&quot;, but I've got to admit that I really enjoyed &quot;Sleepy Hollow&quot; with Johnny Depp. Rather than the self-absorbed schoolteacher in the original, this Ichabod Crane is a police inspector come from New York City to investigate a rash of decapitations in the hamlet of Sleepy Hollow. Depp's Crane is a proponent of forensic science, and is trying out all kinds of gadgetry while attempting to solve this grisly mystery. And did I forget to mention that this is a comedy? Black humor, to be sure, but I really enjoyed this version of Washington Irving's horror story.</p></body></html>

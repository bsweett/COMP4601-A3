<meta name="summary" content="Great action/comedy"></head><body><p>It's one of Hollywood's freakier genetic experiments: inserting genes from a domestic comedy into the DNA of an action thriller. The real surprise is that the result is not only viable, but lively and enjoyable. The action sequences keep it moving, but the humor of the over-familiar couple is what makes this really worthwhile. Anyone who's been coupled for more than a few years will recognize all the signs: affectionate gestures so habitual they're almost invisible, not-quite-listening to most of what's said, and the daily routine (or rut).<br /><br />And the little secrets we keep from each other. There's no ill intent there, just things we don't want our other to worry about, or things that would be harder to discuss than they're worth. Like, for example, the little thing about international assassinations for hire.<br /><br />There are no grand themes here. It's just entertainment - lots of action, and enough wit to keep you paying attention. If you just want to kill a few hours, Mr. and Mrs. Smith are the ones to do the job for you.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></body></html>

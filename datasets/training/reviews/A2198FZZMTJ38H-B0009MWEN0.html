As a storyteller, his sense of direction tends to be hit-or-miss; some turn out fine, while other flounder. As a director, his sense of over-the-top style and dazzling special effects provide viewers with a like-it-or-hate-it experience, even saving some of his films from failure.<p>&quot;Starship Troopers&quot; is a special case, a movie so gawdy and ridiculous, so over-the-top in effects and lacking in logical plot that many who see it will be divided down the middle. For me, the movie works, due to the fact that since the story is sheer sci-fi hokum, you can put it all aside and just enjoy the spectacular roller coaster Verhoeven has crafted, a thrill-ride of rollicking visual effects and action stunts that inspire laughter in all the right ways.<p>The film's beginning is slow and monotonous, as it introduces us to the characters and sets up the conflict. We meet several students at a futuristic high school, on the verge of their graduation and parting ways. It begins with Carmen (Denise Richards) and Johnny (Casper Van Dien) being in love, trying to make it work as they part to train and become troopers, though Carmen gets the wandering eye for a fellow pilot, and they part ways.<p>As all of this happens, a race of alien bugs, which inhabit a distant planet, have sent an asteroid to Earth, which destroys Buenos Aires, the hometown of Johnny and Carmen, who, along with the entire Starship Troopers force, wage war on the bugs, landing on their planet on a mission to wipe them out.<p>The story is small on development, which will turn away those looking for logical plot twists and lucid storytelling. &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; is concerned with neither of the two, and instead chooses to focus on the elements of excitement, humor, and satire. And for the most part, this gamble pays off, delivering on many of these promised elements while leaving the plot in its wake.<p>I'll come right out and say it: the action is tremendous, big on special effects while low on tension and connection. This is due to the absence of story, but it hardly seems to matter. This is Verhoeven's canvas, and he turns it into a playground for some very stunning visuals that are as exciting as they are completely cheesy (even a five-year-old could tell that the bugs are fake).<p>But, for some reason, it all seems to work. There are scenes that provide a reaction of awe and wonder, such as a scene in which a missile is fired into a bug cavern, creating a tremendous explosion that does all but leave you sitting still. Lots of gunfire, running, chase scenes, bloodshed, mayhem, and explosions keep the energy at a high. These scenes work because their unbelievability and silly conception are so humorous that you can't help but go along with the gimmick.<p>There are even elements of satire present, involving the use of propaganda and images that look like something out of a futuristic World War II. The movie plays like a promotional campaign for enrollment in the armed services, and Verhoeven shows no shame in interspersing such videos throughout the film. Throughout all of the movie, there also seems to be a sense of surreal patriotism that is corny and clich&eacute;d, but works delightfully with the rest of the material.<p>I walked into &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; expecting less than what I came away from it with, and it proved itself a satisfactory sci-fi adventure film. The story is bad, but the effects and virtuoso direction of Verhoeven make this a film for those who consider substance a distraction from style. Just go along with it, leaving scrutiny behind, and the movie works.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Uniquely Brilliant"></head><body><p>If there was ever a movie where reviews shouldn't contain spoilers, it's this one, so I'll keep this short.<br /><br />As I watched this movie, it seemed really interesting, with tension created from the first moments and continuing throughout.  But as I started to reach the end, it seemed that the plot was reaching a conclusion which made the whole movie rather pointless, if not depressing.<br /><br />Then the ending of the movie turned me upside down and gave me a serious case of vertigo.  I was being told that most of what I had come to believe and become attached to during the movie was flat out wrong.  In fact, the shock to my beliefs regarding the characters and plot was so profound that I had to watch the bonus materials on the DVD to finally believe and accept what I was now being told.  Never before have I had an experience like this with a movie, and the movie is thus uniquely brilliant and certainly worth watching more than once.<br /><br />The general lesson which is illustrated with tremendous power is that, even among those of us who actively try to be objective and critical thinkers guided by evidence, we're still very prone to developing false beliefs and then bending over backwards to resist evidence which contradicts those beliefs.  Beware of your own mind!</p></body></html>

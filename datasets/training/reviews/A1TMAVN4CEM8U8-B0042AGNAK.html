<meta name="summary" content="Better to read a book"></head><body><p>Ghost Rider staring Nicholas Cage and Sam Elliott is probably the worse movie that I've seen this year.  My stepson who is 25 says it is one of his favorite movies.  Since kids don't read books anymore, it makes sense that Hollywood is making movies out of comic books.  That's just about their speed. Anyway, I wouldn't waste my time or money on this movie.  I'd much prefer to read John Ringo's latest book.<br /><br />Was that Peter (Easy Rider) Fonda playing the Devil?  How ironic?<br /><br />Poor acting, even though Sam Elliott is one of my favorites.<br /><br />Over the top plot, if there is a plot?<br /><br />Gunner June,2007</p></body></html>

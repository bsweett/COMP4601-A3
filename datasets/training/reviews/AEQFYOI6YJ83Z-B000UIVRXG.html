It was a wonderful homage to horror movies--both a parody and, oddly enough, a horror movie in and of itself.  "Hot Fuzz" takes that concept one step further--by combining parody and action, it creates a self-aware action movie that stands as both a parody and one of the most thrilling movies you will ever see.<br /><br />Nick Angel is a top London cop--he's so good, he's making the rest of the force (excuse me, that's SERVICE) look bad.  So they ship him out to Sanford, a peaceful village that hasn't seen a murder in 20 years.  Or has it?  As Angel befriends the Inspector's son (and fellow policeman officer), he begins to see that Sanford isn't what it seems; the murder rate is nill, but the accident rate is astronomical.  And when a local business owner keeps showing up at the scenes of accidents...could something fishy be going on in this peaceful English village?<br /><br />Indeed, something is.  Simon Pegg and Nick Frost deliver knock-out performances yet again, as does the superb supporting cast (including Timothy Dalton, who manages to steal most of his scenes--not an easy task, considering the talent in this movie).  Pegg and Wright's writing remains top-notch; the movie is witty almost to the point of being unbearable.  I rented it Friday night, went out and bought it Saturday, and watched it twice more.  It's that good.  "Hot Fuzz" is quite simply one of the best comedies to come out in years; it is smart, funny, and just damn FUN.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Only the 2nd one I saw but I liked it"></head><body><p>Confession to make: the only Hitchcock film I've seen is Psycho and that's it. Films like Rear Window, Vertigo, the Birds have been endlessly parodied yet I never saw the originals. Well on a renting spree I saw it and thought, well why not. It's certainly one of Hitchcock's more personal and some argue his best although I'd say it's just a good movie period.<br /><br />Scottie, a police officer, had a little accident while chasing a criminal, costing the life of his partner as well as giving him an extreme fear of heights. Now off the police force, he takes smaller jobs. One such request from a man is an odd one: to trail his wife Madeleine not because she might be cheating but she potentially has the spirit of a woman from mid 1800's.<br /><br />It's simple at first but he ends up falling in love with the woman. Only he receives some news: the 1800's woman died at 26, the same age as Madeleine. After Madeleine jumps to her doom(this is no means a spoiler), Scottie is broken and damaged until he sees a woman who looks remarkably similar to Madeleine. His love for her remains so he tries to make this new woman Judy the same as Madeleine. It's love turning into obsession that's not as healthy as you'd think.<br /><br />At 2 hours long, the film at times felt its length. More than once I looked at my DVD timer to see only an hour and so passed. But these would usually be a sign of a good film where you want it to last for awhile cause you're so caught up in it. Frankly Psycho had better pacing.<br /><br />It's funny how Vertigo was known more for the "shot" rather than the film. In at least 4 instances, the middle of the frame seems to sink while the outside grows. Hence the famous "vertigo shot". Steven Spielberg and many others used a technique similar to this. There's also a little freak out near the end with an effect that I always called the slowed down Batman shot. You know the old 60's show where the face would go closer to frame than back with the music going "da na na na na!". Same thing here only more surreal.<br /><br />The actors do their parts extremely well, including Jimmy Stewart who plays a part that you wouldn't see in A Wonderful Life. Kim Novak in a duel role with each part more distinctive than the other so it's not just the same performance in different makeup.<br /><br />The restoration process unfortunately isn't all that great. I noticed a couple of specks and the audio at times had a weird buzziness. But with Hitchcock and the many films he's done, after Psycho and the Birds, try Vertigo.</p></body></html>

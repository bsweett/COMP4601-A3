Great story about the Monsters all little kids fear in their bed at night, and their interaction with those kids.  It gives you the persepective from the other side of your closet door where the Monsters live.  The characters are very lovable.  Great, great comedy sequences, you will be laughing out loud!  Unique story line. "Loving" out-come.  Enjoy!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Jimmy Stewart is amazing as George Bailey passing through various stages of life!"></head><body><p>What really struck me about Jimmy Stewart's performance is how he played the film's protagonist George Bailey as he passes through various stages in his life.  I first saw this film when I was in my 20's, so seeing Steward play the character as an impatient young man was illuminating.  At the point in the story where all of George's friends have just finished college, while he is still stuck in Bedford Falls tending to the Bailey family's Savings and Loan, strikes a familiar chord.  At that time in my life I was a weary engineering graduate student, and felt that my life would never really get going.  Stewart plays George Bailey at that age as sullen and indifferent to any possibility that his life might take a turn for the better.  George is played by Stewart in such a way that he struggles betray no interest in Donna Reed's character Mary, the girl who had admired George her entire life--and who George will eventually marry.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A film for action fans, not classicists"></head><body><p>Wolfgang Peterson's "Troy" is a film for action buffs and not for classicists.  Here, immortality does not belong to the gods but instead to the fierce warrior, Achilles, who intends to fight the kind of battles that will etch his name in history for thousands of years.  A bit egotistical, yes, but it makes for a ferociously buff Brad Pitt intent on stealing the show, both as an actor and as a character.  "Troy" gives us an insolent Achilles (Pitt), lethal killer and hedonist, who fears no one, not even Agamemnon (Brian Cox), the king he fights for and for whom Achilles has nothing but disdain.  When Menoleus' wife Helen (Diane Kruger) steals off with the effete Paris (Orlando Bloom), brother-in-law Agamemnon sees the perfect opportunity to launch a war against his nemesis Priam (Peter O'Toole).<br /><br />Bloom's Paris is such a moronic wimp that it's hard to imagine he had the guts to convince Helen to escape with him to Troy.  Diane Kruger's Helen is equally clueless; even when she finally realizes that her departure from Sparta has jeopardized an entire nation, her attempts at rectifying matters are feeble and easy to put aside.  This choice to steer away from true passion and to present the couple as ineffectual is partly what makes "Troy" such a riveting film; the battles rage around Paris and Helen even though neither is worthy of such passion and violence, making the war seem unstoppable and stoked by more deeply rooted issues of pride, power, and greed. Despite its failings, "Troy" doesn't not have a boring moment in it.<br /><br />The stupidity of bringing the Trojan Horse inside the city walls recalls Monty Python, and some of the lines spoken by Paris and Helen are laughable; however, the film contains some fine roles and performances.  Peter O'Toole portrays a human Priam, gentle and full of love for his sons, and Cox's Agamemnon makes a dangerously arrogant foil for him.  Eric Bana as Hector exudes nobility and honor as well as a fierce passion for his family.  Sean Bean's Odysseus is so natural and likeable that I wished he had a bigger role.  The most astonishing performance is Brad Pitt, who is wholly believable as the unparalleled warrior and lover Achilles. He evokes barbarianism and passion in one sidelong look.<br /><br />As long as viewers don't expect accuracy, those looking for a riveting story and physical clashes will enjoy this film.</p></body></html>

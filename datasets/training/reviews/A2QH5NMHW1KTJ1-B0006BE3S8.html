<meta name="summary" content="just as I suspected, well not really, it was ok."></head><body><p>Walking in the theater I didn't expect much of this film seeming that this film was pg-13. I saw this film out of curiosity. The first 20 minutes of the film was just boring because I was just waiting for them to fight. I understand that they got to explain the story and all but c'mon. It should have just tooken like ten minutes. I was close to walking out of the theater. The story line was great, terrible acting of course. But it turned out to be an enjoyable film. I wouldn't watch it again because it really wasnt that good. This film could have been a lot lot better but it seemed to be ok. I wouldn't recommend it, but watch it if you want just to see how it is.</p></body></html>

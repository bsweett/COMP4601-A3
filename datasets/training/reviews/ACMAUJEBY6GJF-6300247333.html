<meta name="summary" content="True to the original..."></head><body><p>...,but is that a good thing? According to a lot of reviewers here and around the globe, well, not exactly.<br /><br />2006s' "The Omen" is not a bad movie. It's not horrible, worst movie ever, embarrassing or anything close to that. But compared to the original (and many will compare these two versions being that the original is legendary, perhaps one of the best horror-movies ever made) it is ironically "doomed"!<br /><br />So I agree to that there's not much of a point remaking the exact same story to the screen. A few minor changes perhaps, but surprisingly few new surprises. A couple of unpleasant scenes, but the atmosphere of the original is missing throughout the entire picture. The music sounds like John Williams' "Jaws Theme", not bad -but why? Too similar. The boy acting Damien looks too much like the son of the devil. Not much of a disguise here. But that little boy in "The Ring" actually looks far more scary. And he's not even evil. So I didn't care too much for the casting.<br /><br />It's like the entire crew knew that this was never to become anything close to the original? So why bother?<br /><br />But if you haven't seen the original, who knows? I was entertained, not many surprises as mentioned as I couldn't stop comparing the two. But I'm an old fan, and this is a new movie. There's nothing wrong in the filmmaking, epic camera work, interesting locations. All in all an ok movie.</p></body></html>

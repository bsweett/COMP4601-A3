Guy Ritchie's first film was the energetic "Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels" with its kinetic film editing and highly creative direction.  Much like Quentin Tarantino's first film "Reservoir Dogs" Guy Ritchie's first film was not as polished as their respective follow-up films.  For Quentin Tarantino his next creation was the landmark film "Pulp Fiction" which improved on every aspect of his first endeavor but with a more complicated storyline and more streamlined direction.  The same can be said of Guy Ritchie's second film, "Snatch."  His first film was fun and often exhilarating with its stylshly shot gun fights and elegant camera work.  But with "Snatch" the end result is more fluid, the interwoven plot-lines loaded with interesting characters and snappy British slang and wit (some of which may be a bit difficult to pick up on for first-time viewers).  "Snatch" also has a fine cast of international actors, easily the most notable being Brad Pitt (a bare-kuckle boxing champion gypsy) who steals every scene he is in.  No other character is as memorable as his, but all have their moments.  The actual filmmaking in "Snatch" is superb, with all the kinetic editing techniques used in "Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels" taken to a whole new level with additional freeze-framing, fantastic slow-motion photography, and some great sound-editing that hook scenes together.  Just watch the final bare-knuckle boxing match near the end of the film if you want to see how stylish Guy Ritchie's direction can be.  This is an entertaining gangster film with great characters and inspired direction from Guy Ritchie.  This is the British equivalent to Quentin Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction."  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

Hostel 2 is the exact same premise as the first, but this time it gives you alot more than what you expect. This time you are taken behind the scenes of the opperation its self. You get to see who is involved in the 'hunting' process and who is sick enough to pay top dollar to fulfill their most gruesome of fantasies. Once again Eli Roth pushes the bar with the torturing of 3 young women who get lured into this sick world. Again in a short amount of time he really develops the characters so you actually connect with them. This time you see both sides of the coin, through the eyes of a trouble torturer who is wondering if it's something he really wants to do. There are so many things that you will see that either make you cover your eyes or even stand up and cheer. Hostel pt. 2 is a well done continueation of the origional and it will surley leave an impression on you in a sick and twist way that only Roth and producer Quinten Tarentio can bring you.</p></body></html>

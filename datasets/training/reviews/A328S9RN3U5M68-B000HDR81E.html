<meta name="summary" content="Enough Already!"></head><body><p>THE BREAK UP  is one of those tiresome 'comedies' that Hollywood grinds out on the basis of star power.  In this case the star power begins with a story written by Vince Vaughn (along with Jeremy Garelick and Jay Lavender), suffused with the same Vince Vaughn that is the 'character' for all his films, and the DVD ends with an extended loquacious justification for the film given by - who else? - Vince Vaughn. It is as tedious and boring as the actor himself, though legions of fans of potty mouth slapstick over-the-top loud-mouthed 'humor' will doubtless disagree.<br /><br />Peyton Reed  was brought in to control the overacting of the Vaughn character and actually is able to allow the other actors in this tired story a chance to shine. The story itself? Vaughn and the superb and beautiful Jennifer Anniston meet clumsily at a Chicago Cubs baseball game where Vaughn introduces the overbearing obnoxious beast that he is in the first few minutes of the 'courtship'.  The courtship and marriage of these two people is contained in snapshots during the credits, sparing us from that extended episode.  When the film actually begins we are already in the midst of a relationship on the skids: Vaughn (a bus tour guide for Chicago with his two brothers Cole Hauser and Vincent D'Onofrio) and Anniston (an art gallery person working for the kinky and fabulous Judy Davis) live in an elegant condominium which becomes the landing pad for a breakup of their tenuous marriage.  It is a case of who can out gross who, all the while supported by mutual and individual friends.  Anniston wants to feel appreciated; Vaughn is insensitive and irresponsibly immature.  How it works out is the only good thing about the film: it doesn't!<br /><br />There are some fine little cameos for folks like Joey Lauren Adams, Jon Favreau, the above mentioned Judy Davis, Jason Bateman, Justin Long, Ann-Margret etc and they do what they can to add a bit of lustre to this venture, but it is the tedium of watching fighting between two people for 105 minutes that drags the picture down.  The reason for 3 stars?  Jennifer Anniston who continues to prove she can overcome almost any bad script and make it watchable.  Grady Harp. October 06</p></body></html>

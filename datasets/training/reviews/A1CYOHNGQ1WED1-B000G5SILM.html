When another agent is murdered, investigators played by Kiefer Sutherland and Eva Longoria are called in. They uncover a plot inside the secret service to kill the president and eventually the evidence leads to Douglas. The final act of the film is Douglas using his skills to elude the rest of the agents while he tries to prove his innocence.<br /><br />The Sentinel is an enjoyable thriller, but not completely enthralling. The story is a little weak. The performances are good as these are all actors with a lot of experience. It's a good movie, but not a great one.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Eragon Dragon"></head><body><p>Eragon finds a stone while hunting for deer in the forest. Its an egg, in fact, a dragon egg, and it decides to hatch and mark Eragon as its rider. There aren't many dragons left in Eragon's world, and the ruler (who rules because of his own dragon) wants any other riders out of the way...<br /><br />I thought it was pretty decent at the time, but the more I think about it, the less I know why. There's mention of elves and such, but the only fantasy characters seen are the dragon and a couple of soldier-types. I've got a couple of plot questions as well.<br /><br />It's okay, not terribly inspiring though.</p></body></html>

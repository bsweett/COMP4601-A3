<meta name="summary" content="Love is Real, the rest is all illusion"></head><body><p>WOW ... this was an A-HA film! After seeing it at a theatre on the Upper West Side near 86th and Broadway in New York City ...I couldn't help but wonder how the leading lady could be killed off so early in the film? Nonetheless... Edward Norton is spellbinding as a master illusionist whose calm exterior portrays the haunting magic in 19th century Vienna. When Duchess Sophie and magician Eissmann are reunited after 15 years they do everything to be together. The only problem is Sophie's somewhat arranged marriage to the Crown Prince Leopold who is secretly plotting to overthrow his father ...and needs to marry Sophie to get the support of the Hungarians. Leopold is a tyrant in the making who refuses to have his plans thwarted and will go to any lengths to secure his visions of an Austro-Hungarian Empire.<br /><br />After being separated as young teenagers, Eissmann traveled the world and performed to become a master illusionist... but he could never let go in his heart his beloved Sophie.... until his return to the city of their youth. The rest that follows is slight of hand and tricks that even fool the head police inspector. Chief Inspector Uhl is following his and Sophie's every move, and on orders from Leopold to find the fraud in the illusionist's act since Eissmann's popularity eclipses that of the Prince. Nothing is as it appears and the plot only gets more confusing the more the police try to figure out how the tricks are being performed.</p></body></html>

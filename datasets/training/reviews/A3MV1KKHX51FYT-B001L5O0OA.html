<meta name="summary" content="Nostalgic Christmas Comedy"></head><body><p>The film begins in winter, children await Christmas. The cars suggest the 1930s. Kids view a department store window. Ralphie sees the one toy he wants: a Red Ryder BB gun. People listen to "The Lone Ranger". Mother knows there is danger with such a toy. [Ralphie's fantasies reflect the cowboy movies of the 1930s.] Remember those snow suits? Would they act up in class? Would they stick out their tongue? What do they want for Christmas? What did his Dad win? How do the piggies eat? What an artistic lamp? They don't make them like that anymore! Remember 15 minute radio programs? Remember tires that often went flat? Getting your mouth washed out with soap? [Was 'Lava' worse than 'Lifebuoy'?] "A crummy commercial!"<br /><br />Ralph's father fights with the furnace. His Mom has an accident with that lamp. Ralphie learns about peaceful coexistence in the alley. Can he ask Santa for that BB gun? We see an elaborate Christmas parade from that era. Santa Claus warns him about that BB gun. Christmas arrives, Santa left a load of toys. Aunt Clara sent a special gift for Ralphie. Isn't it cute? "What's that behind the desk?" Ralphie learns that a BB gun is dangerous when not properly supervised. [A metal backing ricochets towards the shooter.] An open door is dangerous when there are hungry dogs outside. Where can they find a restaurant on Christmas Day? They'll always remember that day.<br /><br />Jean Parker Shephard had a late-night radio show from the late 1950s to the late 1970s. He would reminisce about the days of yesteryear, as in this film. He wrote books during this era. The fact that he lost an eye in childhood was a secret. You can surmise the cause. Any gun is a danger when mishandled by an inexperienced child. BB air guns were originally designed as a toy or tool for adults or responsible children. If you remember another version you'll know they were more explicit about the damage to the eyeglasses. This film shows how commercials to children are used to control buying by adults.</p></body></html>

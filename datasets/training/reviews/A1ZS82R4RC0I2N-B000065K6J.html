<meta name="summary" content="Til Death Do Us Part"></head><body><p>This suspenseful cult movie is one of the few horror flicks of the last years that actually has an intriguing idea and a decent execution.<br />Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) is a teen student that is about to enter a plane in order to go to Paris with his classmates. Before he enters it, he starts seeing visions, premonitions and strange allucinations that force him to believe that something is terribly wrong. That feeling is enhanced when he enters the plane, and suddently feels that it is about o explode. So, Alex goes hysterical and leaves the plane along with six people, and afterwars it (surprise!) explodes. This is just the beginning of the process, as Alex soon discovers that death will be back to take the lives of those who escaped the explosion.<p>The concept is interesting and, although most of the movie`s strenght relies in its more nightmarish/ paranoid first twenty minutes, director James Wong ("X-Files", "Milennium") still knows how to keep things going in a surprising way. The death scenes are not only creative and thrilling, but also darkly comic. The atmosphere is gloomy with some appropriate blue tones, the score efficient and the acting satisfying. The character development could be better, but it`s still decent, and the timing and suspense are good.<p>This, like "Scream", is an edgy, clever picture, that also goes for the tongue-in-cheek approach (especially in the second half) and a fine horror movie about Generation X (it even has a dark, unsettling, mysterious mood).<br />A good one.</p></body></html>

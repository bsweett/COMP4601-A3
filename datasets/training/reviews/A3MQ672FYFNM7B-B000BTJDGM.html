<meta name="summary" content="STAY AWAY FROM THIS PICTURE IF YOU WANT A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP"></head><body><p>This movie is SCAREY! I saw this a couple of months ago, thinking it was a good Halloween horror picture that would be a lot of fun to watch. I was WRONG! I didn't sleep all night after I watched the film because I was so terrified. It was a great movie, but very TERRIFYING!<br /><br />Emily Rose is a college student who gets possessed by a demon. Unfortunately she dies and her priest is charged with her murder.<br /><br />This film makes the original Exorcism movie with Linda Blair look like the Muppets Take Manhattan. The Exorcism of Emily Rose is NOT for the faint of heart and I do not recommend it for children. I have never gotten so scared from a movie in my entire life, and I have seen plenty horror pictures.</p></body></html>

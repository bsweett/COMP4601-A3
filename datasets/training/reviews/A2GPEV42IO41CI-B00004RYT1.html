<meta name="summary" content="Lock the Bathroom Door!"></head><body><p>For those who have been living on another planet, Psycho is the granddaddy of all slasher/psychological thrillers, and still the best. Janet Leigh plays Marion, a small-time thief who checks into the wrong motel for the night. It is run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), an odd young man who really loves his mother. It seems Mother doesn't like Marion, and Janet's character is dispatched in the first reel. More mayhem follows until we discover the secret of the old Bates house.<br /><br />Much of the film takes place in the very scary house, with its dark, empty rooms, long starcase, and creepy cellar. The movie is spine-tingling and shocking. Those who saw it in the theatres on its first run were overwhelmed by the violence, and many still can't take a shower without locking the bathroom door.  The soundtrack was completely original at the time, and was the prototype of terrifying mood music. If you want thrills, Psycho is the movie for you. The acting and script are outstanding. The movie is in black and white, but I think that makes it even better.</p></body></html>

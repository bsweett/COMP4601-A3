<meta name="summary" content="It succeeds in presenting and commenting on the genre of film noir"></head><body><p>One way that this film does this is by digitally affecting the film by providing it with unnatural color schemes that are identical to the ones in the graphic novels.  Now, the reality of the movie/genre/graphic novels, is a kind of hyper realism that doesn't feel realistic (this is fictional after all) although you know that some of the things that happen in the movie could happen and the film plays with these conventions well.  Noir is a genre that takes the audience into the mind of an everyday person and shows how they can be corrupted by sin, but still being a conflicted and basically good until their sin is found out and they're destoyed.  Well, in this movie there aren't many of these characters, most of them are sinners and gladly and accept the consequences indefinitely.  This is where the movie is the most interesting in the way that the color scheme both allows the action to go to extremes and get away with it because it presents an unreality and if you choose to view the perspective of the movie/graphic novel as the dream world of gritty noir characters than you have a good idea of what the film is like.  What's unexpected are how many portions of this film are so darkly humorous like when Benicio Del Toro's character is being drowned in the toilet by Clive Owen, it's completely unrealistic and we laugh at his plight because he deserves it and will do anything to get out of it, anything short of apologizing and backing off.  Yes, although this color scheme helps the film get past its aggressive, super-violent and gruesome content that doesn't mean you don't feel the effects of it.  They are still there, but you are always aware of the unreality and that somewhat deadens the effect and probably likens your reaction to the way the characters feel.  I felt the movie was as true to the graphic novels as possible even going as far as to call the movie plagiarism (That would be if Frank Miller weren't as involved as he is).  The movie is brilliant, if viscerally so, but although it is based on a graphic novel and anything slightly animated is bound to attract kids, this film is anything, but for kids.  I've mentioned the violent content without going into the more bloody details, but the sex is just as present and I'm not sure this dreamworld is one that you want your kids to know about yet, at least until they're older and have a better understanding of classic film noir, because as I said before this is a tribute and at the same time it's an update of the genre. Enjoy at your own risk.  By the way, I just have to give a shout out to Mickey Rourke who put in a great performance.  It's so big that it's almost too much for the rest of this film to stand up to.  I'm glad to see that he can still be used to great effect in films.</p></body></html>

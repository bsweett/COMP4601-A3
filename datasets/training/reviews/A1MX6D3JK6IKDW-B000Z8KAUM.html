We have a real stinker,little more than a modern day version of the classic "The Sting". Redford and Newman would be on the floor in stitches watching this pathetic debacle. In the first place, there are just too many people running around,and even though each player fulfills his role, the characters actually tend to distract rather than attract the viewer. Secondly, Clooney fails to step forward as the leader of this retaliatory project; instead of Superman, the audience gets Clark Kent.Pacino tries mightily to be the "heavy", yet things get so bad at the end that this mobster can easily be taken as a sympathetic character; certainly not what was intended.Looking for a Christmas gift for your worst enemy? You've definitely come to the right "casino".</p></body></html>

It was &quot;The Godfather.&quot; From its incredibly well-scripted opening scene to its final closing image, &quot;The Godfather&quot; is one of the greatest stories ever told on the screen. Heck, one could call it a big-screen painting of an era. This was Marlon Brando's finest performance and Al Pacino's kickstart into legendary fame. This is also the greatest gangster movie ever made. Coppola delivers all the goods with this one. We have action, drama, romance, and even the occasional laugh. It is a wonderful image of the 1940s mob scene and was the top of its genre until &quot;Goodfellas&quot; joined it about 15 or so years later. &quot;The Godfather&quot; is a timeless classic and a must-see for all film enthusiasts.</p></body></html>

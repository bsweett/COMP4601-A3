Carter is a self-taught man with a thirst for knowledge that is never quite quenched.  He has three children, a devoted wife, and is an ace mechanic.  A telephone call one morning from the hospital changes everything.  The operation he had months before was unsuccessful and has terminal cancer in the brain.  Carter finds himself in the hospital participating in a "promising" experimental treatment.  Carter's roommate in the hospital turns out to be none other than the CEO of the hospital, Edward Cole (Jack Nicholson).  Edward has built a fortune and an empire by turning failing hospitals around into relatively profitable businesses.  However, as Edward soon learns profitable hospitals aren't necessarily customer friendly or the nicest places to stay.  Edward has a similar illness as Carter and the men from two different worlds soon develop a friendship.  One day, while waiting for his test results Carter begins writing a "bucket list" a list of all the things he would like to do before he "kicks the bucket".  When he receives news that he only has about six months to live at the most, Carter abandons the idea.  Edward, however, won't allow Carter to give up so easily and together the two men take off on a journey around the world living out their every whim, from skydiving, to eating lunch on one of the Great Pyramids, to racing expensive sports cars.  Along the way the two men learn a great deal about friendship and themselves.<br /><br />THE BUCKET LIST is a fairly engaging, sentimental movie.  The movie has a strong emotional appeal, especially if anyone has lost a parent or parental figure in their lives.  Freeman and Nicholson make a great team and I wish they would have done more movies together in their careers.  On the negative side, the opening and concluding segments of THE BUCKET LIST are a bit confusing.  Also, I was a bit disappointed that the film didn't have more of Carter and Edward participating in more adventures.  Despite the confusing moments and a lack of adventures, THE BUCKET LIST is still a pretty decent film with a lot of heart and an important message about living life to the fullest.</p></body></html>

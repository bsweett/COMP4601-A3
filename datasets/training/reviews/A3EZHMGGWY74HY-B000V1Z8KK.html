His skills have improved greatly over the years and I think any poor presentation on his part was due to poor script/storyline.  This one kept us on the edge of our seats...Rambo and Bourne Identity all wrapped up in one.  The only thing I thought the film could do without was perhaps the cliche scene of our lovely "love interest" holding a shotgun while wearing her finest Victoria Secret apparel.  It just seemed to predictable that we would witness her in her skivies holding a weapon...sometimes these movies really are all the same.  But, all in all, an exciting ride that you won't want to miss.</p></body></html>

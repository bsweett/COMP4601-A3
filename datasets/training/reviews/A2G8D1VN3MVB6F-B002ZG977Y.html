It is was filmed and edited very well and the special effects were very great. The story was mostly focused on action and did not pay attention to the story underlying this movie. It was all chop, chop, chop, then some talk and maybe a little more talk, but then back to chop, chop, chop. All in all, it was not a bad movie. It was just good and entertaining.</p></body></html>

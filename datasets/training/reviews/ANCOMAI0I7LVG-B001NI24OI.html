<meta name="summary" content="Quite possibly the best sports film ever made..."></head><body><p>The idea of the inspirational sports drama is not a new one.  It has been ravaging havoc in the cinemas since the dawn of time, and while they are truly a dime a dozen, there is rarely a film that actually captures the very meaning and essence of the sport it is championing.  All too often the films are littered with so much saccharine `goodness' that the whole point of the story is bogged down by clich&eacute;d Hollywood atmosphere.  They all wind up blurring together in a long line of disposable, familiar, sports movies.<br /><br />There is no oomph!<br /><br />That is why I absolutely love this movie.  `Friday Night Lights' is not your typical sports drama.  Stripped down and basically bare to the bone, this film is as rough and tough as they come.  With the grit needed to really pack a punch to the gut, and the emotional core to elevate this from the ashes that are every other sports film, `Friday Night Lights' is a shining beacon on the game that has become the lives of so many.<br /><br />This is one of the only sports films to actually make the sport the leading character.<br /><br />The film is based on the true story of a high school football team in West Texas.  The team consists of your `typical' members, from the star player (who happens to be black) to the quarterback struggling to leave his home-life off the field, to the careless rebel suffering at the hands of an abusive father.  INSTEAD of playing to each clich&eacute; like it was the saving grace of the film, and exploiting each storyline for each tear it can muster, this film allows the players lives to further embellish the power of the game itself, breathing life onto the field, where it belongs.  Instead of focusing our attention on how these young men are going to patch up their lives off the field, we are brought to the sobering realization that if they don't patch their lives up ON the field, their lives are basically worthless.<br /><br />This game is EVERYTHING to them, and you feel that in your soul.<br /><br />With an onslaught of powerful performances from Lucas Black, Garrett Hedlund and Derek Luke, as well as an amazingly moving turn by country superstar Tim McGraw, `Friday Night Lights' has not a single wrong note.  As the film draws to its dramatic and heartbreaking climax there is a moment where everything seems lost and broken only to have it all come together in the most meaningful and appropriate of ways.  It isn't forced, it isn't out of place and it isn't sappy; it is just right.<br /><br />Yes, I cried.</p></body></html>

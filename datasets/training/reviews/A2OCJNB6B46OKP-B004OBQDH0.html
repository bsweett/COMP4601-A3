Harry Potter has been through quite a lot in his past 6 years at Hogwarts, but now it is time to make the full transition from child to adult.<br /><br />For the first time in film history a film based on a single piece of literature has been broken in two in order to bring the entire story safely to film. `Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1' shows us all the steps taken to the final showdown between Harry Potter & Lord Voldemort. With it comes many challenges and hurdles for Harry and his friends to overcome.  This film, while many call it a 3 hour filler is probably the most overlooked of all the films. This part of the story has some of the most incredible acting and character development seen in the past 6 films. With some amazing heartfelt moments that cause a rollercoaster of emotional states. I am quite surprised that this film gets so much flack. Now that I have seen Part 2 and I can firmly state that this section of the final chapter is in fact the better movie. I was more on edge watching this film than the second and maybe that is because I am one that really appreciates acting more than action. Not, that there wasn't good acting in the second part, but you will have to wait for my final Harry Potter film review when ` Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2' is officially released on DVD and Blu Ray.<br /><br />I also keep stating that I have a major beef with Blu Ray. Before Blu Ray was released they managed to give us just as many special features on DVDs and now since Blu Ray at least to me is nothing but a space saver the film industry is literally taking a massive dump on DVDs. I have watched DVDs and yes the picture is clearer, but it is the film itself that makes me enjoy what they are.</p></body></html>

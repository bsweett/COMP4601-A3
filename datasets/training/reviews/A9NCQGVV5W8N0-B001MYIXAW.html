<meta name="summary" content="A Lyrical, Poetic, Deliberately Ambiguous And, Most Importantly, 'Faithful' Adaptation Of John Ajvide Lindqvist's Novel"></head><body><p>**The following review pertains to a DVD release of the film featuring the original "theatrical subtitles". I can't pass comment on the 'hacked about' subtitles that appeared on the original US domestic release DVD of the film as I haven't seen it; but I am led to believe that it vastly changes the timbre and tone of the film as much of the more nuanced dialogue is sacrificed. Seek out the original "theatrically subtitled" version where you can.**<br /><br />Oskar is a bullied twelve year old who lives with his mother in a council estate in the Blackeberg suburb of Stockholm. His life is a painful litany of physical abuse at the hands of his peers, over-mothering, and impotent rage expressed through the collection of articles about serial killers from newspapers and magazines.<br /><br />However Oskar's life is to be forever changed by the arrival of the new girl next door, Eli - who is something far more and also far less than she appears...<br /><br />Tomas Alfredson's film of "Let The Right One In" is a lyrical, poetic, deliberately ambiguous adaptation of John Ajvide Lindqvist's novel. Adapted for the screen by Lindqvist himself, the film is far more focussed on experience of childhood (through the travails of Oskar and Eli) and decidedly less focussed on the lives of tertiary adult characters such as the 'Sun Palace' regulars (Jocke, Lacke, Virginia, Morgan and Larry).<br /><br />That is not to say that this isn't a faithful adaptation of the novel - it is. It's just that Alfredson and Lindqvist have quite wisely realised that film is a very different medium to literature and in paring down the sub-plots, and characters at work within them, they throw the themes and concerns of the novel into sharp relief in a way that would probably only have been possible to achieve through the medium of a television mini-series had they retained the depth and multitude of sub-plots and characters from the original book. Purists may bemoan the absence of a number of characters (Oskar's wayward adolescent neighbour and his rigid policeman stepfather are nowhere to be seen, and Hakan's obscene sexual predilections have been excised and his character subtly reinterpreted in a way that may suggest that he and Oskar may have a lot more in common than is at first apparent) and sub-plots (the zombie-style rampage of a character who has received Eli's sanguine attentions has been removed; and what has been perceived by many to be the novel's most controversial twist is vaguely alluded too rather than explicitly stated), but to my mind, this only strengthens the film as one focuses directly on the uniquely un-sugared vision of a world seen though a child's eyes. The only other film that I can think of that has so perfectly provided a window into the experience of childhood is Terry Gilliam's stunning, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KB4898">Tideland (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a><br /><br />Performances are extraordinary. Lina Leandersson is perfectly cast as Eli and she uses her strange, otherworldly - but rather pretty - young face to dynamic effect. At no point did I relate to her as a child actress; she really 'is' Eli.  Similarly, Kare Hedebrandt perfectly captures all the naivety, rage and introspective joy of Oskar's lonely young soul.<br /><br />The period setting of Stockholm in 1981 is perfectly captured. I grew up on a council estate in the UK in the early 1980's and was stunned by how the Swedish council estate in th film evoked the look and feel of my own experience growing up 'on the block'. Similarly, the fashions of the clothes and d&eacute;cor of the time are perfectly evoked to the point that I forgot that I was watching a film made in 2008 rather than a period piece.<br /><br />In terms of set-pieces, I was expecting a lot from this film, in particular from the swimming pool sequence towards it's end - and it delivered. Boy, did it deliver. That one sequence alone was worth purchasing the film in my opinion. It really did feel like I was watching exactly what I had envisioned when I read the book.<br /><br />Although not to everyone's taste, if you're in the mood for a beautifully filmed, languidly paced examination of young love and the loneliness of childhood (or is it a chilling portrait of the emotional manipulation of an isolated, vulnerable young boy by a ruthless predator that just appears to be a twelve year old girl? or even an allegorical tale of the primoridal manifestation of a wounded anima?) with some oblique horrific overtones, then you could do a lot worse than to pick this film up.<br /><br />A word of warning for more impressionable viewers though. This film has haunted my waking hours in the week or so since I've watched it and has effected me in a way that no film - not even Darren Aronofsky's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005Q4CS">Requiem for a Dream (Director's Cut)</a> or Gaspar Noe's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00009W0U4">Irreversible</a> - ever has before. It may be the air of nostalgic melancholia, the pervasive sense of loneliness that haunts every frame, or it may just be due to some unresolved issues from my own childhood, but be careful of this one - it gets into your head. That said, it may well now be my favourite film of all time.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the novel - consider it a must-see.</p></body></html>

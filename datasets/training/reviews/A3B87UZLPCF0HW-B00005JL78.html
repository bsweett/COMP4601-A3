After six years of experiments, Pre-Crime law enforcement - in which murderers are caught before they commit their crime, thanks to the aid of a trio of psychics - has been deemed a success and is on the verge of going national. The project is headed up by Lamar Burgess (Von Sydow) and his protandeacute;gandeacute;, John Anderton (Cruise) who - through this technology - have prevented any murders taking place in the capital for the last six years. Others aren't so convinced - chief among them, F.B.I agent Ed Witwer (Farrell), assigned to find flaws in the system. When one of the psychics - known as 'Pre-Cogs' - predicts that Anderton will commit murder, the former golden boy is forced to go on the run from a system that he helped create.<br />Neither Spielberg nor Cruise have a reputation for making really uncommercial films and Minority Report doesn't deviate radically from their respective career trajectories. It is - with the honourable exception of Schlinder's List - perhaps the darkest movie in Spielberg's catalogue to date. Certainly, it's the most adult orientated of his films. For the most part it is a very enjoyable and intelligent film, which shouldn't fail to entertain most audiences. I liked it.</p></body></html>

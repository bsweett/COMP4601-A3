There is a lot going on and sometimes it gets hard to figure out who is doing what but if you slip into the mode that is `Sin City' is will all put itself together for you.  You just have to want to `get' this movie.  I wanted to `get' this movie, and you know what, I did, and with each and every watch through I `get' it even more.  The fact remains that Sin City is above and beyond brilliant film making.  It's visually stunning and completely captures the imagery that Frank Miller created with his graphic novels.  It's dark, gritty and aggressive; violent and seductive.  `Sin City' is an amalgam of everything that makes `sin' in general so grotesque.  In other words, it's the dark underbelly of a life all too often glamorized.<br /><br />`Sin City' takes three stories from the `Sin City' alumni and interweaves them throughout one another to create the appearance of one long story.  The three stories used (`The Hard Good-Bye', `The Big Fat Kill' & `That Yellow B*****') all feature some strong if not flawed characters that have a habit of making some very poor decisions.  What is strange though is that we form attachments to these characters despite their behavior and we find ourselves rooting for them in the long run.  You see, despite their flaws and transgressions they are victims themselves and warrant our support.<br /><br />The acting is spot on for the type of film that this is.  I've heard some friends talking about the cheesy dialog and the wooden acting but what they fail to realize is that this is a comic book adaptation and it takes that very literally.  Robert Rodriguez brilliantly crafted a world that is so similar to the one Miller created frame for frame it feels like reading a comic, like peering into Miller's graphic novels.  The acting thus corresponds with this vision.  The dialog is at times even word for word from the books, and the way the characters respond and or interact is classic comic exaggeration.  It all comes together to create the perfect backdrop for the film.<br /><br />Bruce Willis, Clive Owen and especially Mickey Rourke nail their performances, adding depth to the film as a whole.  Jessica Alba actually pulls out her finest performance to date (who would have guessed it) and made me proud, and I think she's nothing more than a hard body so she took me by surprise.  Elijah Wood is effectively creepy, something I didn't think he had in him, and his character stayed with me long after the credits were rolled.  As a whole the performances are strong and are all memorable, Benicio Del Toro and Rosario Dawson coming to mind as key supporting players who make an impact.<br /><br />Yes, there are flaws to be found within `Sin City' but to me they are few and far in between.  I love what Rodriguez, Miller and Tarantino were able to accomplish here and I eagerly await their efforts with `Sin City 2'.  If they are even half as successful with the second act I will be a happy man.  So just sit back and absorb the imagery for even if `Sin City' is not you cup of tea you can't help but admire the art that is set before you with each passing frame.</p></body></html>

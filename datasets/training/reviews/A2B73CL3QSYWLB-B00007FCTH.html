<meta name="summary" content="Is This the Greatest Film of All Time?"></head><body><p>"Citizen Kane" has always been enigmatic to me.  There is no denying that when this film was released in 1941 it was light-years ahead of other films in regard to technique, story-telling, and enough cannot be said about the superlative cinematography by Gregg Toland.  The screenplay by Herman Mankiewicz is superb.  The ensemble acting by the Mercury Theatre troupe is outstanding. Orson Welles had to have the most chutzpah in the world to make a veiled biography of William Randolph Hearst, one of the most powerful men in the world at this time.  But is this (bold letters for effect)THE GREATEST FILM OF ALL-TIME?  In all likelihood, yes.  That said, I would not rank it as one of my favorite films but one I deeply admire.  With apologies to Roger Ebert, this film can probably be best viewed in a film course where it can be analyzed and dissected.  It may just be me, but I hold "The Godfather" in higher esteem, a film that is both art and entertains.  A film by Orson Welles that I enjoy more is "A Touch of Evil" because it has higher entertainment value(and atmosphere to die for).  Another recommendation for Welles fans is "The Third Man", a film that Welles appears in but did not direct but it sure feels like he did.</p></body></html>

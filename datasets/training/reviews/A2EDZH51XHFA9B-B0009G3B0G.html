So you can imagine I was slightly thrown by this one. For the most part, it was a pleasant surprise. (Though I'm now wondering where on earth I got that idea in the first place.)<br /><br />Jack Starks (The Pianist's Adrien Brody) is a Gulf War veteran trying to get home. His first encounter on the road is with a mother and daughter whose car has broken down; his second is with a hyped-up kid. Sometime during the second encounter, he loses consciousness, and we see a disjointed account of the next batch of time; it ends up with Starks confined to a hospital for the criminally insane, where Thomas Becker (Blade's Kris Kristofferson) is trying a radical new treatment on dangerous patients involving a straitjacket, a cocktail of psychoactive drugs, and a morgue drawer. Starks' reaction to the treatment is, to say the least, different; if you haven't heard anything about it, I won't spoil it for you.<br /><br />The Jacket's opening half hour reminded me, in all the wrong ways, of the opening half-hour of Pitch Black; it's confusing, disjointed, and looks like a first film. Maybury has even less of an excuse than Twohy, having been directing for well over a decade at this point. Once we actually get into the story, however, and some of the confusing things about Starks' treatment regimen are made clear, the movie improves tremendously (again, like Pitch Black). Even the acting gets better: Brody transforms from a guy who was obviously hired because of his ability to whine, which has been on display in far too many films, to the guy who won an Oscar for The Pianist. Keira Knightley gets a role she can sink her teeth into, and does it quite well. The rest of the cast, which is no small potatoes (Road to Perdition's Daniel Craig, Jennifer Jason Leigh, an all too brief appearance by MacKenzie Phillips, Brad Renfro, etc.), also perform up to standard.<br /><br />The one thing you're liable to get your teeth into, if you're a nitpicker, is that the movie flaunts all conventions of time. And there's certainly an argument to be made that Massy Tadjedin's screenplay is cavalier (to say the least) on the subject. That said, if you're willing to overlook the inconsistencies as unimportant to the plot device, you're likely to enjoy the movie a whole lot more. In fact, if you can convince yourself that Tadjedin is proposing a whole new theory of time, you're likely to enjoy it quite a bit. If you strip out the odder aspects of the film, it's a nicely-done mystery flick with a number of good performances. ***</p></body></html>

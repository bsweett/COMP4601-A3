Upon thinking about it, and rewatching the film, I have changed my opinion to some extent.  While still not the best movie ever, but for a monster movie it does a very nice job.  Plus the idea of bringing together iconic film monsters, such as; Dracula, the Wolfman, Frankenstein, and even Mr. Hyde making a cameo, was a unique idea and one that director Stephen Sommers pulled off magnificently.<br /><br />"Van Helsing" follows the adventures of a vampire hunter named Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman), who first appeared in Bram Stoker's classic novel Dracula.  Now Van Helsing hunts more than merely vampires, as he takes on various monsters for a secret organization within the Catholic Church that seeks to rid the world of evil in all it's forms.  Through his journey he comes across the lovely Anna (Kate Beckinsale), a kindred spirit for Van Helsing, and together they must stop Dracula and his minions from destroying anymore lives than they already have.<br /><br />The concept of bringing together so many of Hollywood's classic movie monsters in one movie seemed like an idea that would never see fruition.  As cool as the idea was there just didn't seem to be a director, let alone a special effects house that would be able to do justice to so many epic characters.  That is, until director Stephen Sommers resurrected the classic monster, the mummy, for his big budget films "The Mummy" and "The Mummy Returns".  The films did so well that they even spawned a spin-off that served as a prequel of sorts to the franchise, called "The Scorpion King".  With a director that was adept at reinvigorating classic monsters, Universal Studios saw the chance to bring more of their classic monsters to life, thus "Van Helsing" was born.<br /><br />With the enormous success of `The Mummy' franchise and now with "Van Helsing", director Stephen Sommers is proving himself to be Hollywood's go-to-guy for monster movies.  With good acting and a good storyline that blends so many of Hollywood's classic monsters together without rushing any of them, this really is an enjoyable monster flick.  Now that the origin is essentially out of the way for this updated version of Stoker's classic vampire hunter, it will be interesting to see where this franchise will go in future installments.  Since, "Van Helsing" was successful, it is conceivable that Universal Studios would move forward with a sequel, so here's hoping for another great adventure in "Van Helsing 2".<br /><br />"Van Helsing" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and minor sensuality.</p></body></html>

Such languorous pacing adds nothing to the film - except fuel the audience's irritation with an unforgivably predictable plot and some pretty heavy-handed moralizing. Darabont tries his best to wring some significance out of King's story, but the material ultimately proves too slight: this tale could have been capably told in 100 minutes or, better yet, deployed as a vignette in a prison film such as Darabont's vastly superior 'The Shawshank Redemption'.  Dragging it over three hours stretches the material too thinly, and in the end leaves a potentially deep story looking rather shallow. This is a good lesson in filmmaking: you can have a fine director, a savvy cinematographer, a marvellous score, an excellent cast, and $60 million to play with - but if you don't have a decent screenplay, then you might as well stay home. Just ask Kevin Costner.</p></body></html>

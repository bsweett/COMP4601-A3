<meta name="summary" content="A vast improvement over the original"></head><body><p>While I was more than a little disappointed in both the writing and production values of the first "X-Men" movie, the sequel more than makes up for the deficiencies of the original.<p>"X-Men United" lives up to its name: Whereas the original X-Men movie was basically "Wolverine, guest-starring some X-Men," the sequel greatly expands the time we spend with the other characters, and all of them are the better for it, including a more compelling vision of Pyro than even the best of the comics has shown us.<p>While the story picks up months after the original, this time, the story is bigger, grander, and more exciting. The film hits the ground running with an amazing sequence introducing the teleporting Nightcrawler, in an eye-popping attack on the Oval Office. Contrast this to the obviously foam rubber girders wrapped around the X-Men at the climax of the last film, and it's immediately obvious that the special effects this time around will be something to enjoy, not something to overlook, and so they are.<p>As always, the acting, particularly by Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellan, is top-notch. The strong central presences of the films' Wolverine and Magneto continue to ground audiences in the larger-than-life world of the X-Men and with the tease in the last few moments of the film egging on comic fans, it'll be too long to wait for the third installment in this series.<p>Recommended for superhero fans, including those who thought the first film didn't live up to its potential.</p></body></html>

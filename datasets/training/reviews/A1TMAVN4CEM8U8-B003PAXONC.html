Smith struggles to live in New York City with his German Shepherd dog surrounded by cannibalistic super strong zombies that only come out at night.  This is a jarring apocalyptic movie that speaks well of Hollywood.  I'm glad that someone in Hollywood is reading Science Fiction.  There's a ton of science fiction books that could be made into good movies.<br /><br />This movie is based on the novelette <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0765318741">I Am Legend</a><br />Recommended for fans of Will Smith, and science fiction (Note:  I have not read the book so I don't know how closely the story follows the book.)<br /><br />Gunner  October, 2008</p></body></html>

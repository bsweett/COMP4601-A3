The past twenty years have seen remakes of such beloved horror classics like "Night of the Living Dead," "Dawn of the Dead," "The Omen," and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"; because of that, I guess the idea of remaking John Carpenter's "Halloween" was not so far fetched, after all. Of course, that got everyone wondering: Can this new version in any way, shape, or form live up to expectations? Having seen it, I can say without a doubt that the answer is yes. Quite frankly, this is one of the best horror remakes I've ever seen, updating the original story into a dark, gritty, and stylistic fright fest. As far as remakes are concerned, I'd say that this is in the same league as John Carpenter's "The Thing" or Marcus Nispel's "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."<br /><br />Taking the reigns from Carpenter is Rob Zombie, who's first movie--"House of 1,000 Corpses"--gave the horror genre a rejuvenating boost. While the film itself was unfocused and derivative, it's style was eye catching; watching it, I knew that, if given the right material, Zombie would be the skillful horror filmmaker he set out to be. He's lived up to that potential with "Halloween," a film that does a masterful job of updating--but not rehashing--the original 1978 film. Carpenter's version was brilliant in its ability to build tension, keeping masked madman Michael Myers hidden in shadow, having him strike at just the right moments. Zombie's version is also brilliant, but not in the same way: he gives the film a primal edge that perfectly captures the rage and evil that is Michael Myers.<br /><br />This is a good thing, especially since Zombie has created a much more compelling and understandable Michael Myers back-story, beginning in his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois. As a ten-year-old boy (Daeg Faerch), Myers was disturbed, showing psychopathic behavior by hurting and killing animals. He also lived in a troubled household, with a verbally abusive stepfather (William Forsythe) and an uncaring, promiscuous older sister (Hanna Hall). The only person he loved--the only person who loved him back--was his mother (Sheri Moon Zombie), who earned a living as an exotic dancer. Everything changed fifteen years ago, on Halloween night; in a fit of rage, Myers savagely murdered his stepfather, his sister, and her boyfriend (both of whom refused to take him Trick-or-Treating).<br /><br />Eleven months later, Myers was institutionalized at the Smith Grove Sanitarium and put under the care of child psychologist Dr. Samuel Loomis (Malcolm McDowell). He noticed how disconnected the boy was from the world, seeming unaware of what he did, continuously covering his face with masks made out of paper and crayon. The murder of a nurse permanently closed him off, leaving his mother heartbroken and Loomis baffled.<br /><br />The story then flashes forward to the present day. Now in his mid-twenties, Myers (Tyler Mane) is mute and obsessed with wearing masks. After learning that Loomis plans to stop all forms of therapy, Myers uses unnatural physical strength to escape during a patient transfer. His attacks are savage, using violence that's quick, raw, unnerving, and ultimately bloody (it should be noted that the aftermath of every murder is far gorier than anything seen in Carpenter's original film). After killing a truck driver in a rest stop bathroom and stealing his jumpsuit, Myers heads back to Haddonfield on Halloween, taking residence in his abandoned childhood home and covering his face with a dirty white mask hidden beneath the floor.<br /><br />From here, the film effectively pays homage to many of the original film's subtler nuances. We meet Laurie Strode (Scout Taylor-Compton) and her friends Lynda (Kristina Klebe) and Annie (Danielle Harris, who played Jamie Strode in the fourth and fifth "Halloween" sequels). The three are typical high school girlfriends: popular, pretty, and boy-crazy. Both Laurie and Annie spend Halloween night babysitting, which introduces us to young Lindsay (Jenny Gregg Stewart) and Tommy (Skyler Gisondo). Like the Tommy of the original film, this new Tommy is curious about the Boogyman, so much so that it begins to annoy Laurie.<br /><br />As the film draws to a close, it becomes a taut, suspenseful ride, pitting the unlucky teenagers--primarily Laurie--against an incurable killing machine. If you haven't seen the original films, then I can't tell you why Laurie becomes his target; let's just say that the two are somehow connected. They play against each other during the final scenes, all of which crescendo to screaming heights. Zombie did not hold back in his attempts to frighten the audience, which is appropriate given the kind of film "Halloween" is. Just as Carpenter's original version defined the Teen Slasher film, Zombie's version defines creative reinterpreting; he took a well-established story and gave it some fresh blood, resulting in a frightening new film that respectfully pays tribute to its source (example: the inclusion of the original "'Halloween' Theme"). If you appreciate the art of horror filmmaking, then Rob Zombie's "Halloween" is the movie for you.</p></body></html>

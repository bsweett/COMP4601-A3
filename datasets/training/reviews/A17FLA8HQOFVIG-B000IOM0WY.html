That doesn't matter though because the part didn't call for a great performance.  Ditto for Charlize Theron.  Her acting doesn't matter either because she's so attractive that all she has to do is appear in a scene and all eyes will be on her.  Then there is Donald Sutherland, who does a good job in the role of her aging ex-con father who has taught her everything she needs to know about safecracking. But my very favorite actor in this film was Seth Green who is cast as a computer hacker who winds up controlling traffic jams in Los Angeles.<p>There's murder, of course.  And lots of chase scenes.  One is on the canals of Venice and involves speed boats and gondolas.  The car chases are really good too.  In one scene the cars drive down the stairs and on to the tracks of the Los Angeles subway. Best of all is the plot.  It moves so fast and held my attention so much that I didn't have time to think about how impossible it was.  And of course I was rooting for the thieves.  Isn't that what a caper film is all about?<p>I realize that this film certainly wasn't real and most of the acting was mediocre. But I can't help it. I loved it. It was two hours of pure relaxation.  And I highly recommend it as a truly fine escape film.</p></body></html>

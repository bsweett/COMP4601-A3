However, after a while, all the events seem to come together and flow with the story.  It's one of those movies that takes a lot of time and patience to understand.<br /><br />It's a story about living forever.  Or rather, trying desperately to find a way to live forever, through a series of fairy tale events and strange happenings.  The acting is really good, the story is interesting, and the magical feeling of living forever is a great touch.  I recommend it.</p></body></html>

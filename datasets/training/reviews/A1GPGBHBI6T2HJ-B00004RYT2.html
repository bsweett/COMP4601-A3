Sure 'Braveheart' was good, but how often did Mel Gibson have to film in zero-g for 20 seconds-at-a-time? I think pulling that off alone was an amazing feat worth recognition...but the Academy felt that Ron apparently hadn't quite EARNED it--YET.  How unfortunate.<p>This movie inspired me like no film I have ever seen has.  I went out and purchased a copy of 'Lost Moon' (the novel on which the movie was based by Jim Lovell) and immediately was lost within the pages of this truly amazing adventure.  If you think that these three astronauts nearly bought the farm in only as many times as was described in the movie, think again.  They had several other life-threatening situations just as frightening as any put in the movie, but due to the constraints that filming a movie can cause, they were only able to include just a FEW of the horrific moments that marked one of the most dramatic situations that has ever occurred in space.<p>The astronauts and NASA were very aware that there would be no way to send a rescue to a failing spaceship almost 200,000 miles from earth...HOW would they be saved?  That is what makes this an incredible adventure of the highest order.  What brought these men home was a marriage of everyone who knew anything about the Apollo Missions working together in one of the most amazing cooperative units in recorded history.  Sure, there have been many other instances where cooperation has worked to help build or make something great, but the enormous difference here is that these folks had to work together F-A-S-T.  Time was of the essence, and failure was too frightening to think about, in fact as Mission Leader Gene Kranz was famous for saying: 'Failure Is NOT an option!'  Nobody was more thankful for the successful efforts of this impressive group than Jim Lovell and his companions.  Cinematically this movie is absolutely stunning, with special effects that are incredibly realistic without going overboard--effects so good that during the screening of the movie Gene Kranz asked where Ron Howard had gone to restore the footage of the launch of the giant Saturn rocket that was featured only to be totally surprised when he was informed that it had all been manufactured in a studio.  You KNOW its good when you can fool the Launch Director...<p>I STILL view the landing on the moon as the single greatest achievment of the past century, and although today it seems totally foreign to send living humans to a gigantic rock a quarter-million miles from earth, I for one would welcome a return to the moon with open arms.  It would completely re-energize NASA and the entire country (if not the world), and who knows?  It might end up being a first step towards sending a probe with humans to Mars...?  <p>Aside from the truly fantastic film this movie is, all of the extras that come with the DVD version are ALL so very worth passing up the VHS version entirely.  Commentary from Jim Lovell himself, comparison of the movie footage with actual footage from the ill-fated flight of Apollo 13--if you are looking for a reason to purchase a DVD player, I submit that this movie allows you THE PERFECT excuse to grab one today.  My absolute HIGHEST recommendation.  (grab a copy of Apollo 13 the book, too--truly inspiring)</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Better than Super? Not likely!"></head><body><p>You would be hard pressed to come up with a better introduction of Superman to the big screen. Under the direction of Richard Donner, Superman flies not only on film, but in our imaginations. This is not the first attempt at a live-action Superman, and it is far from the last, but with a lot of work, it was the first realistic portrayal of the man of steel's powers. They knew going in that sub-par effects work would kill the magic of this movie, which is why they spent more R&D on making Superman fly than on any other single element of the movie. In the end, the tag line in the advertising boiled it down succinctly: You will believe a man can fly.<br /><br />Superman speaks to the most basic part of the human imagination. He is what we all wish we could be, both in body and in spirit. He is perfectly good as well as perfectly formed. But if we couldn't believe in his powers, we would never be able to be pulled completely into the fantasy.<br /><br />A perfect hero, however, requires a perfect villain. Gene Hackman brings the right amount of charisma to the cruel and villainous Lex Luthor. You know he is planning the deaths of millions, but there is a part of you that almost roots for him because you just love to watch him berate his underlings.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="RELEASE THE KRAKEN!!!"></head><body><p>I liked it, but, having LOVED the original 1981 Harry Hamlin version, with creatures by Ray Harryhausen, this movie was a little disappointing.  It was good, but I expected more.  With that said up front, I could not wait to see this in the theater, and of course opted for 3D so the creatures  would stand out from the screen.  The Computer Graphic Imaging (CGI) and Animatronics were great!<br /><br />The story begins with a seaman opening a box on his ship that he salvaged from the sea  to find a living baby lying inside on its dead mother's chest.  He takes the baby boy home to raise as his own.  Young Perseus quickly advances to about age 25. As Perseus (Sam Worthington), his mother, father, and younger half-sister are on the ship approaching Argos, they see the huge statue of Zeus being thrown into the sea by the people.<br /><br />Now, let me side-step a minute.  Zeus (Liam Neeson) was the mythological god in charge of the humans. Zeus loved mankind, but mankind was getting a bit tired of honoring the gods all the time and still having to suffer and die.  Zeus also has an evil brother named Hades (Ralph Fiennes) who is in charge of the Underworld.  Calibos lives down there with Hades.<br /><br />Another side-step is that we find out that Perseus is a demigod (half god and half man).  Zeus came down one day, disguised as Calibos and made love to his queen, impregnating her with a son (Perseus).  King Calibos sealed his queen and the baby in a wooden coffin and they were thrown into the sea.  The baby lived, as we saw earlier, and Calibos went to the Underworld for his crimes.<br /><br />Back to the story--now the humans have upset their sponsor, Zeus. The sea begins to rise and Perseus' family all perish in the sea.  He is rescued and taken to Argos, where he meets Princess Andromeda and her family.<br /><br />Back on Mt. Olympus, the Council of gods are having a big meeting.  Hades is just dying to get at the humans with The Kraken, because Hades takes his strength from the people's fear, while Zeus takes his from their love.  Hades says, "Zeus, can I get after the people?"  and Zeus allows Hades to do his thing because the people have shunned the gods of Mt. Olympus.  So Hades appears in Argos, telling the King he has dishonored the gods.  Either sacrifice the princess to the Kraken in 10 days or Argos will be destroyed.  Perseus and the small army of Argos set off on a journey to find out how to kill the Kraken before the 10 days are up so he can save Andromeda.  Zeus sends his son a few special gifts now and then to help him on his journey, such as a special sword and a black-winged Pegasus.  On their journey, they meet giant scorpions, the jin people, and search for Medusa (whose very gaze turns any living creature into stone.)<br /><br />This is a neat movie to see in 3D and on the big screen.  It was filmed in Tenerife, UK, the Canary Islands, and Etheopia.<br /><br />If you have never seen this movie, I highly recommend that you catch the 1981 version, whether you see this 2010 one or not.  If you want both, I recommend you see the 2010 one first.  Both stories follow the same script pretty closely but the 1981 version has a lot more to the story.  I also liked Sam Worthington in this type of action role.  I look forward to seeing him in future action movies.</p></body></html>

It doesn't so much show the life of the Zodiac killer as it does those around him who are trying to figure out who this elusive killer is.  The cast is top notch and the writing is excellent.  At 2 hours and 40 minutes I felt the film ran a bit long and probably could have done with some trimming.  Some of the Zodiac killings are shown and were quite graphic.  I was interested in the detailed facts given in the film, but I am not sure if it was because of the film presentation or that I was just interested in the subject matter.  If you know anything about the Zodiac killer, you know it is still unsolved.  So the film basically ends with them saying it was probably this guy, but who knows.  A minor quibble was the writing on the screen as the movie ended.  It was an update on the main characters of the film.  I have a large television, but the writing was not clear at all.  I had to pause the action and walk right up the screen to read it.  I think this is an interesting film to watch.  I would give it a try before buying.  I am not sure if it is worth watching over and over though.</p></body></html>

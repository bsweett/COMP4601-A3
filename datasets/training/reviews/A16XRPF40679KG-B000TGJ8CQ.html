<meta name="summary" content="average movie that looks good on blu ray"></head><body><p>Next is a average sci fi movie with a decent budget and good performances from top actors.  This movie didn't make it to alot of cities big screens in other words it wasn't a hit flick and it had a very limited release evidently.  It is out on blu ray and the picture is fine but then almost anything looks great on blu ray.  It's worth renting in blu ray if your local store has a copy or if netflix has one for rent but I would wait till the price drops to buy a copy of this one because you can get some real movie classics on blu ray for this price.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A performance driven Hitchcockian thriller."></head><body><p>Amazon's review really nails this film for the intelligent, old-fashioned edge-of-your-seat thriller that it is, but it is a flawed film too.<br /><br />No need to rehash the plot as both Amazon's review and the product description tell you enough about the film, so I'll get right to what I loved, liked, and disliked about this film, but let me warn you in advance that this review contains serious SPOILERS that I feel I can't ignore while writing this review as it specifically connects to the flaws the film contains.<br /><br />This film's strengths:  Don't let the box title fool you with Harrison Ford's name being first, which is based upon his considerable star power, this film belongs to Michelle Pfieffer and to her alone although a very young Miranda Otto from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000654ZK0">The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007KIFI2">Flight of the Phoenix</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNTI">War of the Worlds</a> gives a noteworthy supporting performance.  Ford himself really plays second fiddle to Pfieffer in this thriller and although he gives a good performance, he seems out of place being a supporting actor and looks rather uncomfortable during most of this film.<br /><br />The script is intelligently written and slowly reveals the plot in such a way that we feel we know what is coming, but we are as unsure as Pfieffer's character as to the "truth" of things.  The direction is first-rate by Robert (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00006AL1E">Back to the Future</a> and Forrest Gump) Zemeckis as he experiments with playing Alfred (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783240236">The Birds</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783225849">Psycho</a>) Hitchcock.  He builds this little masterpiece up to a compelling and chilling conclusion that doesn't disappoint even though it does leave us scratching our heads a bit.<br /><br />The film's weaknesses: Simply put . . . it's Harrison Ford's presence in this film which ends up being rather distracting.  At the time he was too big of a star to play such a supporting role and one keeps scratching his head wondering just why he's in this film.  In addition, Ford himself seems so uncomfortable not being the main attraction.  I don't mean that he's too egotistical to play a supporting role, but he had been a number one box-office draw for nearly two decades at this point that I just don't feel he knew how to fade into the background in a less starring role.  Lastly, while he makes a (spoiler alert here) remorseful guilt-ridden bad guy, he does not make a believable self-serving psychopath and the faulty script at the end attempts to make him BOTH.<br /><br />That is the film's other serious weakness.  Ford's character is supposed to be guilt-ridden over an affair he had with a college student that ended with him murdering her.  Ford is actually very good at playing flawed characters as many of his heroes are such, but the script also has him as a lunatic at the end.  First he's genuinely sorry for his affair, his part in the death of his lover, and the pain this has caused his wife to experience, and we, the audience buy that as Ford is great at playing stronge but emotional characters as with his great performances in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005ATZT">The Fugitive</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767803434">Air Force One</a>, but the script then has him enjoying his attempt at murdering his wife (Pfieffer).  He jokingly asks her if she would rather have hot or cold water in the tub as he attempts to drown her and then even loving plays with his dog as she is drowning before his eyes.  Is this the same man who was crying, literally, to his wife over what had happened with that other woman.  In an otherwise intelligently written and well-acted film, this is a glaring inconsistancy in a character and it doesn't add up.  Add that to an already uncomfortable performance by Ford in a supporting role and you get an ending that is somewhat murky if not still thrilling and suspenseful.<br /><br />Well, I don't want to end this review on a negative note as this film deserves all four stars that I gave it, but it's not without its flaws.  This slickly, well-executed thriller is worth both your time and money, but just don't be surprised if you find yourself scratching your head a bit when it's all done.</p></body></html>

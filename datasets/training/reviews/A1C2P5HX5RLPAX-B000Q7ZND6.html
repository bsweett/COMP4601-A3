We were not totally familiar with the comic books so we were kind of lost in the beginning as to what was going on, who was bad and who was good (although that is never totally clear). The special effects and camera work are marvellous. Djimon Hounsou as always is beautiful. Rachel Weisz regretably was weaker than usual and is unbelieavable as a cop. Another notable acter in this film is the beautiful Tilda Swinton. She was beautifully cunning as the fallen angel Gabrielle. This film is worth the entertaining rental value.</p></body></html>

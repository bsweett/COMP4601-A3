<meta name="summary" content="Absolutely heart-wrenching translation of Stephen King's work"></head><body><p>It's difficult to rank the Stephen King works that have made it to the silver screen.  Among them, I'd rank Shawshank Redemption and the Green Mile as the best two.  With that said, I believe no higher praise can be given to one of his works - considering the aforementioned duo are 5-star classics - than to say The Mist probably drifts its way into the award ceremony and snatches the bronze medal with a flesh-tearing tentacle.  It should come as no surprise then, that Frank Darabont was the writer/director of all three.<br /><br />The setup: A dense mist that rolls in from the nearby military science facility envelops a coastal town, causing townsfolk to congregate at the supermarket for supplies.  When otherworldly creatures begin to emerge from the mist divisive factions form.  Some spurred on Mrs. Carmody (Marcia Gay Harden) - a religious zealot whose fire and brimstone sermons prey upon scripture ignorance and fear of the unknown to spawn a cult-like following - believe the monsters to be an Old Testament prediction come true, while others, led by pragmatic but terrified everyman David Drayton (Thomas Jane), scramble to protect themselves and attempt to rationalize the mounting deaths from monsters...some of which did not come from the mist.<br /><br />Ultimately this film successfully explores the erosion of humanity and logic in the face of extreme terror.  It's akin to sacrifices atop pyramids because the volcano gods needed to be placated.  Much of mankind will eventually devolve towards beastly behavior when faced with a catastrophic situation that cannot be explained.  In that regard, I believe the movie is incredibly believable; psyches would fracture and reason would disappear if monsters appeared out of nowhere and began killing us in an array of terrifyingly lethal methods.<br /><br />The entire production of this film is superb.  Everything from acting to FX is nearly perfect in my opinion.  One aspect, however, stood out more than ever before.  The score exudes the very essence of the onscreen mood, and composer Mark Isham absolutely rips emotion out of the viewer's chest.  The Host of Seraphim is, in and of itself, a masterpiece of emotionally challenging music that loops infinitely in my nightmares.  It captures the haunting nature of the entire movie and perfectly accompanies the tragically surprising ending that suggests even the most reasoned of us all, when we believe hope is lost, has a monster lurking within.<br /><br />Jason Elin</p></body></html>

Although a bit slow, the ending is exciting and the realism makes it worth watching. Just how WOULD aliens contact earthlings (and would anybody believe them?), how would the government handle it, and what would happen..... Spielberg gives us a definite hint of his greatness to come with this 70s classic. Worth adding to your collection. John William's score alone is worth buying</p></body></html>

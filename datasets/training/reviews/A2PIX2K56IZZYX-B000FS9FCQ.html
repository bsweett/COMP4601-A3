The best of 2006 so far..........."></head><body><p>Acting--------------------9 out of 10, Weaving and Portman are incredible, Rea and Hurt not to far behind<br /><br />Directing-----------------9 out of 10<br /><br />Location/Scenery---------10 out of 10, Visually stunning!!<br /><br />Action/Drama rating-------9 out of 10, Perfect mix of many themes<br /><br />Quality------------------10 out of 10, Nearly flawless<br /><br />Total Score-------------47 out of 50, A<br /><br />Violence------------High, Amazing knife battles, perfectly choreographed, high gun play<br /><br />Blood/Gore----------Medium to High, Gets pretty graphic toward the end, somewhat mild until then<br /><br />Nudity--------------Very little, Dead bodies and Portman in skimpy outfits<br /><br />Sex-----------------None<br /><br />Language------------Medium, Couple of F-bombs, and many, many bollocks<br /><br />Overall-------------Teens 16 and over should be fine<br /><br />I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this, but I'll try. Easily the most breath-taking visuals I've seen since Sin City, and some of the best acting I've seen since Crash. Hugo Weaving as V is one of the coolest characters I can remember, and he plays it perfectly. I thought Natalie Portman was just awful in the Star Wars trilogy, in fact I really haven't liked much of anything she's done, but she absolutely nailed this, a crafty mix of innocent and troubled persona holding on to a disturbing secret and violent past.<br /><br />The Wachowski Brothers and there protege' James McTeigue have created a masterpiece that I eagerly look forward to purchasing and watching many, many times. Bound to upset others, but I found this to be just as entertaining (if not more) as the Wachowski's 1st visual feast, The Matrix. I know that Alan Moore asked for his name to be removed from the production as he was upset over a few of the minor changes, but Mr. Moore, you have nothing to be ashamed of, you're novel has been transformed into the best movie of 2006, and you know what, I think I just might go watch it again right now, see ya!!!</p></body></html>

I had gotten the idea that it would probably be of more interest to young adults but I can attest that us older folks can enjoy it too.  I admit that I was initially wondering if I was going to be watching a movie or a cartoon but I got to like the animated version of Lola running down the stairs.  The lifestyles on display leave a lot to be desired but I let myself glide past that once I realized what a multi-facetted movie this is.<br /><br />"Run, Lola, Run" is a movie that shows us a lot of stories within the stories and a lot of alternate scenarios.  If you're one of those "if only" second-guessers, this is your chance to find out "what if".  I liked the variables and I thought that the movie was quite unique in that regard.  I won't give anything away although that, itself, may be misleading.  This film challenges our expectations and, in doing so, might be giving us a glimpse of the future.  I recalled a pavillion at the World's Fair Expo '67 in Montreal.  It was, I believe, the Czech pavillion and they showed a movie that stopped at different points in the film when there was a major development.  There was a "time-out" and the audience was asked to vote for one of several directional options that they were given and the movie proceeded with the requested option.  "Run, Lola, Run" looks like a movie in which the production staff got several chances to vote on their options and decided to include them all.  It works!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="ZOMBIE HORROR MEETS ACTION-PACKED  8.75 OUT OF 10"></head><body><p>Resident Evil: Apocalypse may not be as good as the other two Resident Evil movies, but it's still a rather exceptional zombie-horror/action film. This is a zombie film that is definitely worth checking out for any zombie movie fan.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: Raccoon City has been completely overrun by the zombies infected with the deadly T-Virus. The Umbrella Corporation can no longer contain the infection and have now sealed off the the city and will not let anyone else leave and plan to nuke the city off the face of the earth to kill the virus and not let it spread. So a group of people Alice (the main protagonist with mysterious powers and abilities she received through the T-Virus), Carlos Olivera ( A member of the S.T.A.R.S. unit who was left behind by the corporation and became freelance), Jill Valentine (A sexy, unapologetic, police officer), LJ (A criminal who was released from prison when the infection broke out), and Angela Ashford (A little girl who's father created the T-Virus and she has the virus) must go rescue Angela Ashford for her father in exchange for giving them directions to a helicopter which would be the last transportation out of the city before it gets nuked. So they must avoid zombies and the terrifying Nemesis; an abomination armed with a mini-gun and a rocket launcher; who specifically goes out and kills S.T.A.R.S. members and tries to kill Alice as part of a sick kill-or-be-killed survival game planned by the Umbrella Corporation. Alice also has visions of memories of what the Umbrella Corporation did to her after they took her and an environmentalist named Matt from the Spencer Mansion after the first outbreak and experiment on them and cover up what happened in The Hive.<br />MUSIC: The music sets the mood, and has adrenaline rush to it at times during the hectic shoot-a-thon scenes between Alice and the Nemesis or during encounters with zombies and other creatures. I especially love the song played in the credits by Killswitch Engage (The End of Heartache).<br />GORE FACTOR: This movie along with the first one really lack in this area, thank God, the storyline and action scenes make up for it.<br />ACTION: Sometimes the hand-to-hand combat gets cheesy during some scenes which also damages the quality of the movie. But the shooting scenes and zombie action really make this a polished zombie-horror/action flick.<br />ENTERTAINMENT: This film is very entertaining and the storyline will really keep you interested and willing to follow it through every plot-twist and character development. It's a real treat for people who love zombie films and action films and is definitely worth more than just a rental.<br />OVERALL: It may lack gore and the hand-to-hand combat may get a little cheesy and disappointing, but the storyline and action really make up for most of those flaws.<br />THE GOOD: Great shooting scenes, cool zombie and creature designs, great story, cool characters, and Milla Jovovich is hot.<br />THE BAD: Lack of gore and some fighting scenes are cheesy.</p></body></html>

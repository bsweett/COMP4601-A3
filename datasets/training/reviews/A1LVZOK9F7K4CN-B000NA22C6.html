<meta name="summary" content="Good Stephen King adaptation..."></head><body><p>The main attribute of this film is the performance of Johnny Depp as the beleaguered writer.  He is recovering from a divorce (he found his wife in bed with another man) when John Shooter (John Turturro) shows up on his doorstep and accuses him of plagiarism.  Shooter turns out to be psychotic.  It should be easy enough to prove Shooter wrong, but he has a way of destroying everything - and everyone - that gets in his way.  Soon, it seems Shooter is too powerful to be a normal human being.<br /><br />I am familiar with the novella this is based on - it is one of Stephen King's more modest efforts.  The movie takes great liberties with the plot, so even if you are familiar with it, you will be surprised.  I have to say I prefer the ending of the movie to the ending of the book.  I was expecting a typical Hollywood ending, but the film turned it into something much different.  It is the Depp performance that makes everything work.<br /><br />I am not a huge fan of writer/director David Koepp, but he does seem to have good taste in horror fiction (he also filmed Richard Matheson's Stir of Echoes).  Let's hope he continues the trend of making good horror movies.</p></body></html>

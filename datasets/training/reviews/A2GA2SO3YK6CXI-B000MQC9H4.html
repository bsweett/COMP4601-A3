<meta name="summary" content="Don't miss this romantic jewel!"></head><body><p>The Holiday (2006)<br /><br />Right after seeing a rather peculiar Kate Winslet interpretation of Tula, the adulterous woman in a "Romance & Cigarettes" relationship, Ms. Winslet comes back in her lovable self as Iris, a London based journalist who loves a man who gets engaged with one of her co-workers, and broken hearted she agrees to exchange homes with Amanda, beautifully played by Cameron Diaz, an entrepreneur who is so stressed out that she looks for an opportunity to go on vacation and change her reality, agreeing to move to London during her Christmas vacation.<br /><br />This movie is fun, romantic, with enough heartache to get us so involved that we had a wonderful experience while watching it.<br /><br />These two rather unhappy women exchange messages through the Internet and give each other an opportunity to escape sad circumstances that have them both stressed and tired of life.<br /><br />The settings of the cottage owned by Iris are picturesque, intimate and cozy, allowing Amanda to feel part of the world that surrounds her and find an extremely attractive man, the brother of Iris, played by Jude Law who makes her forget that when it comes to relationships: "She is not good at it."<br /><br />Iris on the other hand, travels to Los Angeles and finds that Amanda owns a mansion in Beverly Hills that affords her all the luxury, space, and privacy required to get over the awful and co-dependent relationship she has with her co-worker, played by Rufus Sewell.<br /><br />Iris meets Miles, played by Jack Black, and the two strike a relationship that transforms both into individuals that are finally set free from relationships that do not recognize their self-worth.<br /><br />This movie is a MUST see... delightful, with great scenes and an ability to delve into issues in an endearing, fun and educational manner. Don't miss it!</p></body></html>

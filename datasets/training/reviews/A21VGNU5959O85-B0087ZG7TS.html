<meta name="summary" content="Depressing, not worth a second viewing."></head><body><p>I did not read the book "Atonement", so I had no expectations or any words to spoil the movie for me. I love a good mystery, romance, period piece. I love movies that take us out of the formulaic and into the furtive air. I try not to judge someone's work based on what I "wanted" to see versus what they gave me in the end. That said I was disappointed in this movie, and would never set eyes on it again for as long as I live.<br /> The cover boasts "A Crowning Achievement, A Ravishing Romance!" so of course I am thinking that Keira Knightely and James McAvoy who are two of the greatest actors we have right now (I used to loathe Keira but now see her as an asset to historical dramas), will give a good performance and satisfy my hungry romance loving appetite. I knew the premise going in. Young girl has crush on an older man, he loves this girls older sister, young girl misinterprets their relationship and in her naivety sets into motion events that tear the lovers apart maybe for forever! Can she rectify her mistake, Atone for her lies, will the romance ever be able to bloom without it being hindered by distance and time?<br /> I know there aren't always happy endings, I don't expect them nor do I want them to take place for fear of monotony and blandness. The whole movie was really very beautifully shot, although in some instances a little too perfectly framed. The sweeping shot at the beachside with all the soldiers didn't feel right to my eyes; it felt too "planned" and hokey. The costumes, sets, locations, music, were all well done, but it couldn't save this movie from being completely devoid of heart and soul and ultimately not a "ravishing romance" by any definition. It was pathetic and sad and so disappointing. I don't understand why it got all the attention it did.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Engaging thriller that deflates halfway through"></head><body><p>Identity quickly sets itself up as a tightly-drawn whodunnit mystery thriller. As 10 strangers (including John Cusack, Ray Liotta, John C. McGinley, Clea Duvall, Rebecca DeMornay, Amanda Peet, Jake Busey) come together in a rundown desert motel during a rainstorm, suspicions and fear among them rise when it appears their is a killer in their midst. Adding the intrigue are the seemingly unconnected scenes of a late-night hearing of a would-be sent-to-death serial taking place far, far away from the motel.<br /><br />For about 60 minutes, this 90-minute movie keeps you hooked. Then it sets about breaking all the rules it has set up and massive gaps in logic distract your attention from the increasingly preposterous climax. I can honestly say I never saw the twist coming. But it came too early and led the film into stupidness.<br /><br />It is atmospherically shot and the feeling of isolation is quite cool, even if it doesn't last very long. But, in the end, I've seen episodes of Midsomer Murders that are far better than this. But what do you expect from the guy who wrote Jack Frost 2: Revenge of the Mutant Killer Snowman?<br /><br />The DVD is in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. There are a bunch of extras I don't care about.</p></body></html>

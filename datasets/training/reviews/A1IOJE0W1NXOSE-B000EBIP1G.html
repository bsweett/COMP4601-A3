<meta name="summary" content="Wonderful Christian symbolism"></head><body><p>A worried mother puts her four children on a train and sends them to the English countryside in order to protect them from the war.  They arrive on the doorstep of a professor whom the stern housekeeper says they are not to bother.  One day they relieve their boredom by playing a game of Hide and Seek.  The youngest child, Lucy, discovers an old wardrobe in a deserted room and decides to hide there.  As she steps back in the wardrobe, she enters another world, Narnia, where the White Witch has declared that there will be perpetual winter.  So begins the adventure of "The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe", written by C.S. Lewis who was during the first part of his life, an avowed atheist but who eventually became a strong believing Christian whose literary works influenced many believers and non-believers alike.  The symbolism of the lion Aslin will be clear to Christians and will hopefully introduce unbelievers to the Christian message.  The four children are wonderfully natural in their portrayals and the movie is produced with stunning visual effects.  This is not for small children, but older ones will undoubtedly enjoy the wonderful retelling of Lewis's book.</p></body></html>

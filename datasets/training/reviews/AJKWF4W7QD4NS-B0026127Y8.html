<meta name="summary" content="See it for Neeson alone"></head><body><p>Were it not for the fact that Liam Neeson is in the starring role in Taken, this film from French action/trash producer Luc Besson (The Transporter series, The Fifth Element) wouldn't really be too worthwhile otherwise.  Having an actor of Neeson's stature lends a certain degree of credibility that Taken wouldn't oterwise have, and that alone makes the film worth seeing.  Neeson stars as Bryan Mills, an ex-spy trying to reconcile his estranged relationship with his teen daughter Kim (Maggie Grace).  When Kim goes to Paris with a friend, and subsequently gets kidnapped, Bryan springs into action to save her, and breaks many bones along the way.  There are some genuine surprising moments to be found in Taken, amidst the gaping plot holes, leaps in logic, and overall incoherency.  Still, Neeson is magnetic here, and as said before, had Taken starred a lesser actor, the film would be all the worse for it.  All in all, fans of flashy action will get a kick out of Taken to be sure, but for the rest of us, the film is worth seeing for Neeson alone.</p></body></html>

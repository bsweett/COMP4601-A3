<meta name="summary" content=""Shut the f**k up Donnie""></head><body><p>This movie was recomended to me by of all people my father.  He said its a good stoner movie. Well right off the bat I was committed to seeing it so I went out and bought it.  The first viewing of the movie I was confused and wonderinf if in fact I mean well.... um if I liked it man, Then I watched it a second and third time... It started slowley growing on me man, My fourth and fifth viewing of the movie well ... umm... like I had been smokin some Tie stick man.... and like it was just far out especially the Halusination scenes. With every viewing I have picked up stuff that I had not noticed in previous viewings man, like everytime you watch it you will too.  The movie will definitly grow on you man, so grab a white russian man, and just go and pop in the movie man, and pretty soon you will be calling your self "THE DUDE" you will be saying "SHUT THE F**K DONNIE" etc.  One of the true Stoner movies glad I saw the movie, I highly recommend it man.</p></body></html>

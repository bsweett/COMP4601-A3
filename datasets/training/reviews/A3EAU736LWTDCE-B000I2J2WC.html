<meta name="summary" content="There were picketers when I went to it. Controversial? No, just boring"></head><body><p>Do you know what one of the greatest secrets in human history is? No it's not the story of Jesus. It's how the Hollywood movie industry can sell you a long boring movie that is like watching paint dry, by hyping it up and spending the bucks on mass advertising. Obviously a lot of people out there are easily entertained by some really dull, bromidic, platitudinous material. I mean, why not just stay home and read your dumb book you keep comparing and contrasting it to? I go to movies to be entertained, not fall asleep! After I seen the movie, I said "so what? Who cares?" The answer to that question is church members with their picket signs who have nothing better to do. Their signs say things like "this movie is blasphemous" and "don't see this movie, it is sacrilegious". I think these groups of people soon forget that more people have died in the name of religion than all of the wars in history put together. To add to that same note, the Catholics think their religion is so perfect, yet they seem to forget the hundreds and thousands of innocent women who were tortured and killed in the 14th century because they were deemed to be witches. PLEASE! Put your picket signs away and go back to church! Just seeing them made me wish I liked this movie more, but I didn't.<br /><br />Verdict: it is vapid, and you cannot get a refund on those two and a half hours you spent watching it. I compare it to spending a long amount of time in a hospital waiting room! Although, I look forward to seeing the protestors at the new release of the 'Omen'movie. Just the fact that the movie is being released on 6/6/06. That should get them excited!</p></body></html>

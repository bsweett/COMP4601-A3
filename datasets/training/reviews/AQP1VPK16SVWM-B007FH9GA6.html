<meta name="summary" content="Blu-ray looks terrific in Fincher's American version of Swedish novel"></head><body><p>Trying to adapt a novel after it's already been done by someone else (and done well I might add) can be a challenge; do you make the same artistic choices? If not, what do you change in your approach to the film? David Fincher's version of Stieg Larrson's novel The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo is a rarity in Hollywood--it's a film that adapts the same source and is every bit as good (if not better) than the first version done.<br /><br />I'm not going to summarize the plot here--enough people have done that quite well. Instead, I'm going to focus on the image quality and special features for the Blu-ray set.<br /><br />This is a dark and foreboding film filled with a sense of dread early on (which isn't a surprise given that it's from the director of "Se7en" and "Fight Club"--I wouldn't count on Fincher ever tackling a light comedy).<br /><br />The transfer to Blu-ray is demo quality--blacks are inky and rich looking (particularly noticeable during the opening titles for the film)and detail remarkably sharp with unusually good depth as well.<br /><br />The sound is spectacular with a rich lossless presentation.<br /><br />We get an intelligent commentary track from Fincher discussing everything from the nuts and bolts of making the film to his approach to the material. Interestingly, Fincher was given the novel by producer Kathleen Kennedy before the original film version and Fincher (Kennedy gave it to him because she felt it fit his strengths as a film director) didn't read it at the time believing it would never be bought or opitoned by Hollywood nor that it would become a bestseller in the U.S.<br /><br />The bulk of the special features are on the second disc for the Blu-ray set.<br /><br />We also get exhaustive special features on the production of the film. "Characters" focuses on the three key characters of the film focusing on the casting with Lisbeth and Martin getting the Lion's share of featurettes (six)vs. a measely four for Blomkvist.<br /><br />We also get a variety of featurettes on shooting on location in Sweden and shooting in the U.S.--these run roughly 100 minutes on the disc. A four part documentary also highlights the post-production and ADR process for the film. There is also a very good featurette on the creation of the disturbing main titles (which reminded me of a very vivid, disturbing Bond-like opening sequence interesting since Daniel Craig stars in the film).<br /><br />The extras continue with a featurette on the promotional aspect of the film focusing on an "Inside Edition" styled TV program. It's both fascinating and hilarious as it manages to parody shows like "Inside Edition".<br /><br />The third disc is a DVD copy of the film which has artwork to make it look like a homemade DVD-R with the title written in black marker across the top (as if Lisbeth had made this bootleg herself). It's a clever touch. The only extra on the DVD is Fincher's commentary track.<br /><br />For those who hate Ultraviolet you can continue to hate it more as there is an Ultraviolet passcode included and that's the only "digital" copy available for this film to upload on your computer. My advice if you dislike Ultraviolet is (which has some severe limitations and issues for many people)is to carry around the DVD edition if you're going to watch it on your laptop (you're out of luck when it comes to an iPad or pad-like device as the Ultraviolet streaming edition is the only option and the coupon expires in 2013 on my copy).<br /><br />"The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo" remains a rarity; a film that adapts a foreign novel that was already made into a movie previously AND creates a dread-filled film that equals (and in my opinnion surpasses) the previous version of the film.<br /><br />Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

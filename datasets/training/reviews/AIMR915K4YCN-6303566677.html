<meta name="summary" content="No Doubt About It..."></head><body><p>OK, I had my suspicions after seeing Conan The Barbarian, but this movie proves it beyond any shadow of doubt. Yes, Arnold Schwarzenegger is a cyborg! I watched him come through time and space, hunting down that poor Connor girl (Linda Hamilton) in 1984 LA, and I just knew! His relentless pursuit of Sarah Connor is devoid of any / all emotion! Watching him is like watching any well-oiled machine. His robotic moves are matched only by his mechanical dialogue. Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) comes through the same time portal, in an attempt to stop the rampaging mechanoid, but can flesh and blood possibly stand against such a machine as Arny?? No! Run Reese! Run Sarah! Our very future depends on your survival! THE TERMINATOR substantiates my deepest fears! We are doomed! The infamous &quot;police station slaughter scene&quot; shows us Mr. Schwarzenegger as the juggernaut he is! Unstoppable, concerned with nothing but the termination of mankind! He is now governor of California! Soon, SkyNet will be established and Arnold will become our king! EEK! James Cameron's intense masterwork of sci-fi / horror is perfect for Arnold's plan of world domination! Watch it and believe...</p></body></html>

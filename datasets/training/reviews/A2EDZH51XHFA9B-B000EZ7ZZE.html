His previous credits include work on such things-blow-up-nicely movies as Pirates of the Caribbean, XXX, Gladiator, and Lethal Weapon 3. So you can go into Apocalypse knowing you're going to get, at least, a solid action flick.<br /><br />Then you take a look at the cast. Milla Jovovich returns, of course, but much of the rest of the cast are also known for solid action-film work; there's Oded Fehr (The Mummy), Jared Harris (b.Monkey), Sienna Guillory (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang), Razaaq Adoti (Black Hawk Down), and Zack Ward (Freddy vs. Jason), among others. Getting away from action films, Sandrine Holt (Black Robe) and Mike Epps (Strays) also jump out of the cast. So you know you have a well-acted solid action flick.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's all you get. It's really kind of depressing that one of the few games actually capable of scaring you if played in the right conditions doesn't actually merit a horror film, but there you go. Jovovich reprises her role from the first film, and is here backed up by game characters Jill Valentine (Guillory) and Carlos Oliviera (Fehr). The basic plot of the movie is that the three of them, along with a changing roster of hangers-on, have to both survive the city's undead and get out of the now-quarantined Raccoon City for reasons that the viewer's clued into about halfway through the movie. The result, as noted in the rating, is non-stop violence.<br /><br />Given that, it's surprising how well the film does work on that level. The situation is quite likely to remind you of Predator, arguably the best film Schwarzenegger ever made (and definitely the best film Gov. Ventura ever made); Apocalypse suffers in comparison because the characters don't have anywhere near as much depth, but the action sequences never fail to be just as much fun. I just wish it had more of the outright creepy feel that made Resident Evil 2 (the game) so wonderful. ** ?</p></body></html>

He wasn't as well known as Spider-Man, the Hulk, Captain America, or the Fantastic Four.  Therefore, it was a bit surprising that in their freshman film as an independent film company that Marvel would choose Iron Man as the hero that their future would either be built or destroyed upon.  All doubts, however, have been put aside as 2008 has come to be the year that comic book movies became serious works of cinematic art, beginning with the release of IRON MAN.<br /><br />IRON MAN revolves around Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), a billionaire whose fortune was built upon arms manufacturing to defend the free world from totalitarianism, tyranny, and terrorism.  Stark is also a brilliant scientist and engineer who designs many of his own weapons and devices.  While unveiling a new missile to American troops in Afghanistan, Stark is knocked unconscious, receives a heart injury, and is captured by terrorists.  The group calls themselves the Ten Rings.  They want Stark to build them a replica of the missile he just created for the U.S. Army.  Stark gets to work, but instead of building the weapon the terrorists requested, he builds a suit of power armor that he uses to escape from the terrorist camp.  After returning to the United States, Stark decides that his company, Stark Industries, is no longer going to be in the arms manufacturing business.  Seeing what his weapons can do when placed in the wrong hands is too much and he decides that the company will take a new direction.  He's convinced by his partner and good friend Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) to take some time off.  Stark uses that time to prefect the suit he created in the Middle East.  Meanwhile, Stane has plans of his own and the direction Tony wants to take the company in doesn't fit in Obadiah's plans.<br /><br />IRON MAN is an excellent comic book movie.  The acting is solid, the script well-written, and the direction superb.  The movie completely revived the career of Robert Downey, Jr. and turned Jon Favreau from being just a comic and family-film director into being a major directorial player.  Though hinting at a darker future (as well as plot developments for future sequels), the film is full of hope, optimism, and good old American patriotism.  When one thinks about it, IRON MAN is the type of movie that SUPERMAN RETURNS should have been a couple years ago.  I guess iron really is stronger than steel.</p></body></html>

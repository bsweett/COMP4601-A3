<meta name="summary" content="Way to predictable yet not believable"></head><body><p>It is an old theme for the old actor, Harrison Ford.  In this one, the story is way too old and the plot is way too unbelievable.  Computer wiz is forced by gun-toting terrorists to electronically rob his own bank "or his family gets it."  Of course, this untrained computer geek wizard is able to overcome the much younger and armed bad guys (automatic weapons included) and rescues his family single-handedly.  At least in the Tom Clancy movies the main character is a former marine with at least a believable background to give him the tools to carry out such things.  But a network security expert?  Certainly there are some that might be able to pull it off but, unfortunately, this movie did not see the need to explain how this nerd became so adept at fisticuffs.  The story just assumes that we all believe that rage alone is all we would need to overcome a multitude of evildoers.  Sadly, this movie is all too predictable yet unbelievable to even have much entertainment value.</p></body></html>

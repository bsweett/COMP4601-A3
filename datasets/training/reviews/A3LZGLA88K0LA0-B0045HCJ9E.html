<meta name="summary" content="STILL A RUSH"></head><body><p>It's hard to be cynical about this Alfred Hitchcock classic from 1959.  The impeccable Cary Grant, looking dashing and fit as ever, carries the movie that is filled with deception, lies, murder, chases, you name it..it's there.  He's joined by one of Hitchcock's ubiquitous blondes, the lovely Oscar-winner Eva Marie Saint, and the villain is the dashing James Mason.  In an early role, Martin Landau projects cheesy villainry; Leo G. Carroll bounced back from "Tarantula" as the conniving intelligence director; and Jessie Royce Landis played a rather youthful looking mother to Mr. Grant.<br /><br />The plot should be known to all movie connosieurs by now, but how can one forget the unusual stabbing in the UN; the quiet terror of the biplane's attack; the breathtaking finale on Mount Rushmore.  Ernest Lehman's intelligent script and the always dependable Bernard Hermann's musical score bring this classic to cinematic life for now and ever.  They don't make romantic suspense movies like this anymore!!!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Get 'Back'"></head><body><p>Watching the trilogy back-to-back-to-back on DVD allows viewers to catch many of the quick visual references to previous and future "Future" films. Director Robert Zemeckis and writing partner Bob Gale loved tinkering with their premise, and it pays off in the attention to detail that's sure to inspire multiple DVD viewings.<p>Executive producer Gale does the heavy lifting on the DVD set's many extras, appearing throughout the featurettes and on the three films' commentaries (with fellow producer Neil Canton). Gale speaks softly, with a Ben Stein-toned delivery that won't keep anybody up late. The extras have far too much duplication. "You're probably sick of hearing us talk about these movies," he says gently as "Future III" begins. Only the obsessed will disagree.<p>Gale works hard, though, and delivers the goods for those hungry for production stories. He recalls how Universal chieftain Lew Wasserman ended a salary holdout on "Future III" in Hollywood "Godfather" style, with the balking filmmakers getting nothing extra. " 'Don't mess with Lew Wasserman' was the moral of the story," Gale remembers. Production of the second and third films overlapped, with Zemeckis editing "II" while shooting "III."<p>Zemeckis, Gale and star Michael J. Fox get in their camera time in "Making the Trilogy," a snappy DVD docu that runs as a serial across the three discs. Original making-ofs lead off each disc's extras. The first is surprisingly interesting. Zemeckis and Gale appear on a second audio commentary for each film that repurposes Q&A screenings with USC film students.<p>Fox chips in here and there, looking good. His enthusiasm level peaks as he speaks of the scene in which his Marty character invents rock 'n' roll in "Future I."<p>The set comes in widescreen and full-screen. The widescreen version shows the film as matted by the filmmakers for theatrical release (1.85.1). The full-screen shows the images as shot (about 1.35:1), so there is a bit more visual information. The otherwise informative DVD packaging doesn't cover this. Images look OK, with minor speckling. Colors seem fine for popcorn movies from the '80s.<p>The remastered 5.1 Dolby has some decent rear effects, mostly swooshes and blasts as our heroes ride their time machine, but nothing heavy. There is no DTS track.<p>Deleted scenes should interest fans, especially a dark take in which Biff Tannen's ancestor Mad Dog shoots a father in the back as his son watches. (No one should die in the series and not come back, they decided.)</p></body></html>

Robert Downey Jr. plays Harry; a small time hood who inadvertantly gets confused to be an actor.  After flying out to L.A., he gets embroiled in a devious plot of mistaken identity and murder, while teaming up with a gay private detective (Val Kilmer) and trying to win the love of his life (Michelle Monaghan).  Black does a wonderful job, and his cast is even better as they are clearly enjoying themselves; particularly Downey and Kilmer whose quick witted quips and interplay are enough of a blast to carry the film on it's own.  The only downside of the film is that at times it takes itself too seriously, but Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang is an enjoyable ride regardless.  Fans of action movies, particularly those who have seen a number of ones from the 80's and early 90's, will get a real kick out of this film, and should definitely check it out.</p></body></html>

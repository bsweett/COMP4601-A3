<meta name="summary" content=""The Best Film Of 2002""></head><body><p>Which is a better film, "Minority Report" or "Blade Runner?" I believe that "Minority Report,"is why, because of the plot. "Blade Runner" focused more on 3D effects than on the human story. What I love about "Blade Runner" is the vision of the future and the settings that were both dark and somber. "Minority Report" is also a dark and yet beautiful film. But I have to give credit to "Metropolis"(1925), the first and best SCI-FI film ever.<br /><br />"Blade Runner," "Dark City," and "The Fifth Element" would have never been created without the inspiration of Fritz Lang's "Metropolis."<br /><br />THE PLOT<br /><br />In The Year 2054, a so-called "pre-crime division" is working busily around Washington, DC. It's purpose is to use the precog(native) potential of three genetically altered humans to prevent murders. Author, Dashielle, and Agatha (Samantha Morton), whose power is the strongest of the three. When the three precogs, who only work together, floating in what the police call the Temple, have a vision the names of the victim and the perpetrator as well as video imagery of the crime and the exact time that it will happen, are given out to these special police who then try to prevent the crime from happening.<br /><br />Based on the short story by Philip K. Dick, "Minority Report" is about a cop name John Anderton (Tom Cruise). John has the tables turned on him when he is accused of a future murder, and he must investigate the circumstances of this murder and prevent it before it is too late.<br /><br />*****SPOILERS AHEAD*****<br /><br />The film examines the political and ethical dilemma of arresting a person before the crime is committed. The project of pre-crime prevention is having it's first trial run, and the citizens of the city will vote on it in the next election. If the people vote it in as law the crime rate will drop drastically, but it is unknown whether innocent people might be imprisoned.<br /><br />(...)<br /><br />THE DIRECTING<br /><br />There's a scene that most directors call a two-face-shot but Samantha Morton and Tom Cruise are facing the opposite direction. The two actors chins lay on each other's shoulders, as if almost hugging each other. Then Spielberg takes the camera and places it on the right side of Tom body and captures the two face shot. Tom's face and Samantha's eye's and mouth portray a very powerful scene. Another shot that I call the "Taxi Driver" shot is when Spielberg trails the camera on the roof of the peoples apartment, showing the spiders identifying the people. These days that scene would be digital but Spielberg never uses 3D unless he has too. Spielberg directs his films in a new yet classical way.<br /><br />THE ACTORS<br /><br />Samantha Morton's face conveys total fear and total authority. She received an Oscar nomination for her role as the mute girlfriend in Woody Allen's "Sweet and Lowdown." Tom Cruise didn't get nominated for his breakthrough performance in "Vanilla Sky," shame on the Academy. Tom did receive a Golden Globe for "Magnolia" and 3 Academy Award nominations for the following films, "Born on The Forth of July", "Jerry Maguire" and "Magnolia." Collin Farrell delivers his best performance in this movie to date.<br /><br />There is a mental love story portrayed between Agatha and John. They've both been scarred deeply in the past and fate brings them together at this crucial time in John's life to solve this mystery. The film ends with Agatha sitting in a chair thinking about both her mother and John.</p></body></html>

Fun and action-packed to watch, the new Die Hard is never dull nor boring.<br /><br />Bruce Willis looks great and proves that the Die Hard action actors can still kick it old school! Solid casting - for the most part - and a somewhat new look to the franchise created a fresher look at the continuing series to create a breath of fresh air in action/adventure movies.<br /><br />We will be purchasing this DVD in the near future.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Disturbingly Good"></head><body><p>When I saw this film at the theater, it disturbed me and as a result, I didn't think it was that good.  The disturbing part?  Well, the violence and the language!  But that is an integral part of the movie.<p>When the film later was on cable and I reluctantly watched it, and then watched it again, and again, and again.  I found myself mesmerized each time by the acting, in scene after scene.  Denzel and Nathan were very believable and compelling characters.  The scenes with just Nathan were the most riveting!<p>Though the ending is a canned, quick and furious wrap-up to the story, it is the acting that makes this a memorable piece of cinema.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Best &quot;Star Trek&quot; Film With &quot;The Next Generation&quot; Crew"></head><body><p>Although &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; is replete with flaws, it is the best film featuring the cast from &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;. Jonathan Frakes, in his feature film directing debut, did a fine job getting great performances from Patrick Stewart, Alfre Woodward, and Alice Krige, among others. Patrick Stewart's recitation of &quot;Moby Dick&quot; when Alfre Woodward's character urges Captain Picard to abandon the new USS Enterprise is undoubtedly one of the film's finest dramatic moments. And there are others as well, such as fighting the Borg over the Enterprise's deflector screen array. Indeed, much of the film's mood is almost as dark and foreboding as &quot;Alien&quot; or &quot;Aliens&quot;. Yet there are occasional moments of humor. A star-struck Lieutenant Reginald Barclay (Dwight Schultz) following Zefrem Cochrane (James Cromwell) is a welcome sight, along with cameo appearances by &quot;Star Trek Voyager&quot; cast members Robert Picardo (An Emergency Medical Hologram trying to fend off Borg soldiers, while Dr. Crusher and her medical team flees Sickbay.) and Ethan Phillips (A holographic Maitre D' who welcomes his Borg guests to a Prohibition Era lounge.). Not to be missed either is Counselor Troi (Martina Sirtis) refusing to admit to Commander Riker (Jonathan Frakes) that she is drunk.<p>Devout &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans will be highly critical of the plot. Although Alice Krige's performance as the Borg Queen is a first rate display of malice mixed with contempt towards humanity, her character is a radical departure from the television series. Surely, the Borg don't need a queen to direct their heinous crimes against other sentient life in the galaxy. Although I'm not a devout &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan, I was appalled by James Cromwell's portrayal of Zefrem Cochrane, the inventor of warp drive. It's preposterous to think that Cromwell's Cochrane was sufficiently sober to invent it. And how humanity makes first contact with an alien civilization at the film's end is also played strictly for laughs. Poor Gene Roddenberry must be tossing over in his grave, wondering what producer Rick Berman has wrought.<p>Jerry Goldsmith's fine score is another of the film's artistic triumphs. His Klingon march from &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; becomes a stirring anthem for Lieutenant Commander Worf. He also offers memorable themes for the Borg and their Queen. And of course, his memorable &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; main title is heard again in this installment of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series.<p>Inspite of its flaws, &quot;Star Trek: First Contact&quot; is a fine action adventure film. I strongly recommend it to those who aren't &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans. And &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans will enjoy it, regardless of its flaws.</p></body></html>

See people told me not to pay attention to critics. Never mind a 20% or so rotten rating at rotten tomatoes, for example. They got my 10 bucks. And couple hours I'll never get back. I have noting good to say about this thing. Elements of what goes into a decent film are not present. Of all the mediocre and terrible remakes this ranks at the bottom.<br />Edit (04/07): A little more.<br />The first pre-cgi, pre-video game paradigm movie had a stillness to it and reality that only real sets can achieve. And a stillness brought to the screen during a time when people could sit in a theater and pay attention without busting out with brightly shinning phones to text message.<br /><br />Seems like people younger than late 20s don't even notice.<br /><br />Did you notice the tranquility on Mt. Olympus? Sure the set sucked, but for its time it was good and *what matters now is it doesn't feel like a video game*.<br /><br />Laurence Olivier's performance has lasted. Liam Neeson's will not. Why?<br /><br />And who made a better hero Harry Hamlin or the Avatar manikin?<br /><br />And what about the old playwright played by Burgess Meredith of Rocky and tv series Batman fame (as The Penguin)? He largely made the movie for me. Compare the playwright to the immortal whatever-she-was that I guess was meant to take his place as a sort of story guide or something (Never mind she dies too, which is another idiotic plot hole).</p></body></html>

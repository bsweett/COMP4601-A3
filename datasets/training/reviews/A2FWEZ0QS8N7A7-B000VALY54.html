Robert Downey Jr. is a small-time NYC theft artist who stumbles into a movie audition while fleeing the police.  The audition leads to Hollywood,a friendship with gay private detective Val Kilmer, and the chance to at last sleep with the old high school flame who went to bed with every boy in the school but him.  It also leads him smack into a murder mystery and a body in his apartment.  Downey and Kilmer have great fun with their roles and the supporting cast is fine as well.  LA also stars, looking as glitzy and tawdry as it did in other LA noir classics LA Confidential and Chinatown.  Round it all out with snacks and a nice bottle of wine and you've got a great night of at-home entertainment.</p></body></html>

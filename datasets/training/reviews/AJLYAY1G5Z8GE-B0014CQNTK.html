<meta name="summary" content="Interesting and realistic!"></head><body><p>Juno, a 16 year old girl, gets pregnant and offers her baby for adoption. She meets the perfect couple and they all agree that they will raise her child. Eventually the couple breaks up but Juno still gives her baby to the women who was committed from the very beginning to raising this child.<br /><br />Juno then gets into a serious and loving relationship with her baby's biological father, whom is deeply in love with her, and so is she with him.<br /><br />Interesting, sarcastic, and even a bit funny. A realistic film about a phenomenon that has been on the increase.<br /><br />Ellen Page (Juno) is a very talented young address who will sure be a superstar one day.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not bad but..."></head><body><p>A mildly entertaining romp LOOSELY based on a Clive Cussler novel.  It plays more like an action comedy than the grandoise plots that Cussler devises for Dirk Pitt.  A pity it's only the second adaption (the first being the Lew Grade production of RAISE THE TITANIC w/ the late Richard Jordan -- Francis in LOGAN'S RUN -- as Pitt, Jason Robards as Admiral Sandecker).  Actually, I preferred Jordan as Pitt.  He was an actor who can be truly menacing and was damned good looking. McCounaghy looks to much like a southern California surfer than a deadly agent.  His shtick with Steve Zahn is amusing but in the end forgettable.  If you have time to kill it's entertaining enough.  Nothing more.</p></body></html>

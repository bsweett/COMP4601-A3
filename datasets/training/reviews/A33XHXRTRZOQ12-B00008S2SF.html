It is also, alas, the second weakest Brosnan Bond by far, ahead of "Tomorrow Never Dies", which I've never liked. Things are a little TOO fantastic here and there are far too many "nods" to earlier Bond films, (so many, in fact, that you can lose count!) for this to actually qualify as its own movie, even! You will recognize "Dr. No", "Thunderball", "Diamonds Are Forever", "You Only Live Twice", "The Living Daylights" and others as this "plot" unwinds.<br /><br />It's a complex "plot", too. Bond travels to North Korea, (not a great idea for a westerner these days,) to assassinate a crazed NK colonel who has been smuggling diamonds and generally screwing up the international scene with his shenanigans. To make a long story short and not to produce too many spoilers, Bond gets captured after a rousing chase involving hovercrafts and advanced artillery, gets tortured, released, forsaken by MI6, chewed out by "M" and again, as in "Licence To Kill" has to go renegade for the rest of the movie. Along the way, he meets a woman named "Jinx", played by Halle Berry, who also works for the West, and who is after the same North Korean colonel Bond is. They travel to Cuba, then to Iceland, get captured again, have some cutlery tete-a-tetes with the bad guys, run into double and triple crosses, find the true meaning of plastic surgery and get to use the most amazing Bond car ever conceived of.<br /><br />Believe it or not, the Aston Martin used in this film is equipped with a CLOAKING device, fer cryin' out loud...something that would have the entire assembly of Bond-o-philes themselves going "you're joking", upon hearing this. Otherwise, it's just about as tricked out as Timothy Dalton's was in "Daylights". There's also a nod to Brosnan's run in "Remington Steele", as he walks up to spiffy hotel desk in Hong Kong and asks for "his usual suite" drenched to the bone, with long, scraggly hair and a beard, basically filthy. This is a straight steal from a scene in the two hour, fifth year "Steele" episode, "The Steele That Would Not Die".<br /><br />Anyway, though it is witty, as usual, and though it's got some nice tense moments, this is easily the hokiest Bond film since Moore's laughable tenure as "Suave, Joe Suave". One of the things that was so refreshing about Dalton and Brosnan's Bond films is that they were TONS more realistic than all of Moore's and even Connery's later Bond films, (post "Goldfinger",) with relevant villains in post-cold war dust-ups or drug kingpin situations. This one harkens back to the bad-old days of ridiculous gadgetry, kaleidoscopic plots that owe too much to earlier movies and a general "Bond-parody" feel, rather than a genuine, glamorized espionage adventure.<br /><br />You know, Ian Fleming's novels bore more of a resemblance to Len Deighton's or John Le Carre's work than they did to "The Man From U.N.C.L.E" or Matt Helm. They really should have kept the "realism renaissance" going with this character.<br /><br />Don't even talk to me about Daniel Craig.<br /><br />Palooka...JOE Palooka!</p></body></html>

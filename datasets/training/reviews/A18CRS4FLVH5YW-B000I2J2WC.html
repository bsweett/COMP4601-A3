<meta name="summary" content="One only needs to remember "The Last Temptation""></head><body><p>Back in the late 80's a film from Martin Scorcese was released that caused much of what the Davinci Code is exhibiting today.  Catholics and Christians alike were up in arms about how sacrelige and morally irresponsible "The Last Temptation of Christ" was when it was released to theatres.  I remember being challenged by that movie since I was a devout Christian and struggling with the idealism of what Christianity was all about.  Looking hindsight, "The Last Temptation of Christ" helped me grow deeper with who God was to me rather than what he was to a church built by man's ideology.<br /><br />I believe things much differently 18 years later.<br /><br />Not because of a movie but because things like "The Last Temptation of Christ" made me ask the really tough questions that no one in any church really wants to ask.  Nor does anyone have a solid answer for.  So, "The Last Temptation of Christ" is considered probably one of my favorite movies of all time simply because it's thought provoking and means so much more now than it ever did back when I was impressionable and naive.  Aside from this review, I highly recommend "The Last Temptation of Christ" on DVD available from the Criterion Collection.<br /><br />As far as "The Davinci Code," it's really all relative.  Dan Brown has created a work of fiction to ask the really tough and outlandish questions and in the meantime, put a little spin on things to make people think or in this case, make people laugh &lt;not funny>.  It's not gospel.  It's not trying to be anything but a thought provoking joy ride into the big question, "Is your faith real?"  If so, why is it real?  How do you know?  What do you really believe?  Why do you believe it?  Unfortunately, "The Davinci Code" movie fails where "The Last Temptation of Christ" exponentially succeeds.  After watching "Davinci" I was simply unchallenged and bored.  Nothing in this movie exemplifies great story telling and isn't that what movies sort of need to suspend disbelief?  For those looking for 2 and a half hours of elite escapist entertainment, go see "MI:3" or wait until "Superman Returns," because this movie simply doesn't fit the bill!  This is definitely NOT a "summer" movie by any means and I am quite surprised the studios thought this worthy of a summer opening.  If you're a fan of the book, the movie follows along fairly well but doesn't exceed expectations.  Tom Hanks has finally made a dud film in his long line of hits.  You knew it had to happen eventually.</p></body></html>

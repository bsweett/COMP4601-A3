<meta name="summary" content="A cult classic?!"></head><body><p>I will admit I loved this film, and didn't originally buy it for myself - but I'm definitely keeping it now! But what I don't see is why it's considered such a cult. (Sorry) Maybe I'm not seeing it. I did see similarities with Trainspotting, with all the drug taking, and Quentin Tarantino had a certain je ne sais pourquoi about his directing. I loved how when he was first introducing characters, he only showed them from behind, and all you could see was hair (Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames - or no hair in his case).<br /><br />When the film first started, I was feeling a bit iffy about it all. And then the soundtrack kicked it. It's amazing how you've never seen a movie before (honest) but you know it instantly about the soundtrack! And then the film really kicked off, and I found myself enjoying it. And it has some great music in it (guess what I'll be getting next?) I found myself humming along to "Let's Get Together" by Marvin Gaye (mainly cos it was used in another movie, Down To You), so I definitely think this soundtrack will be great.<br /><br />My favourite bit in the whole film was Uma Thurman's joke. I'm sorry, I really like corny jokes!!! I was in fits throughout the rest of the film - it should really have been shown more towards at the end of the movie, cos I'm sure I missed a good bit after the joke was told! I was literally crying afterwards! For anyone who missed it, or hasn't seen the movie: <p>Three tomatoes are walking down the street. Daddy Tomato, Mummy Tomato, and Baby Tomato. Baby Tomato is lagging behind, so Daddy Tomato goes back, squishes him, and tells him to "ketchup"! <p>I'll never hear the word "ketchup" in the same way again. I think my main problem was I kept seeing the image in my head. It's such a funny image. <p>The person I was most shocked to see in this movie was Bruce Willis! Why didn't anyone tell me he was in this before? I definitely would have seen it long ago! He was quite sexy in it, apart from where he was first introduced - he never moved a muscle, and looked a real hard nut. But he became more gentle and tender when his girlfriend was introduced, and the way he acts towards her will make any girl go weak at the knees! He was definitely a cutie in this. <p>The most memorable moment from the whole film (apart from Bruce Willis coming out of the shower - HELLO he moved too fast, you nearly get a glimpse of something! Will need to watch that slower) is the moment that is always shown in TV shows etc, publicising this movie. It's what I know it for, and that's the tiny dance segment between John Travolta and Uma Thurman. Funny how Uma shakes her pretty black bob a lot during this, but it there's never a hair out of place - tell me that was a wig!<br />Towards the end it does get a bit confusing, but thankfully, unlike some other films, it does tie all the loose ends up, and you're satisfied at the end. <p>Definitely a must-see, although try and replace Johnny Boy with the guy he was in Grease. I may have to watch it a few more times before I consider it a cult.</p></body></html>

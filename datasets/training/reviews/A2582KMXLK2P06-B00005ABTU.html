In fact, it must have been 20 years since I last watched it.  I completely forgot what it was about.<br /><br />Carrie is the name of a teenage girl who has special powers- she has the ability to move objects with her mind.  Her character is that she *constantly* gets picked on by all the girls in her gym class.  They do some of the most revulting things imaginable to her.<br /><br />Furthermore, her mother believes she is evil, so she constantly tries to save her daughter whenever the girl returns home from school by reading from the Bible, screaming in her daughters face that she's sinful, and other ways.<br /><br />Basically, the girl has a bad life, haha.  But... what goes around comes around, eh?<br /><br />The majority of the storyline focuses on the senior prom dance, and what will happen when Carrie gets invited.  Well I know one thing- her mother won't be happy about it, haha.  This is when Carrie REALLY takes advantage of her special powers.  She takes absolutely no crap from anyone, let's put it that way.<br /><br />There are some unintentionally funny moments throughout the film, such as when the head girl in her gym class gets smacked around by her gym teacher and her boyfriend.  It's because she doesn't know when to shut up, haha.  She's *always* getting smacked around by someone.<br /><br />John Travolta... WOW he looks young, haha.  With long black hair, too.  Surprising to see this.  I didn't even recognize him at first.<br /><br />Another interesting thing about the film is how Carrie becomes close to her gym teacher because she's the only one who understands how much Carrie is being picked on by her classmates.  However, it's very surprising what happens to the gym teacher eventually.<br /><br />Also, try to imagine school teachers acting the way they do in this film THESE days, haha.  Hard to imagine.<br /><br />This film is just really cool.  It contains a really weird storyline, solid characters, and establishes Stephen King as a really good writer.</p></body></html>

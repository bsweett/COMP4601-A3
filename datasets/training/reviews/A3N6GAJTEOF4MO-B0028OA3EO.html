<meta name="summary" content="What Made Superman Become So Dull In His Rebirth."></head><body><p>I have to say first, I'm not a comic book fan. I've never read, nor will I ever read any sort of comic book. I am, however, a movie fan. I loved the first two Chris Reeve Superman Movies, (3 and 4 were just dreadful) and I was hoping that with this reincarnation it would bring back the awesomeness of the first two. It seems that with Superman Returns for whatever reason it decided to become a sequel, but not a proper sequel, just a sequel where they change things that happened in the past which we know didn't happen because we watched the first four movies. (The last two, yes unfortunately)<br /><br />I'm going to touch on quite a few things that I noticed in this movie where I raised one eyebrow and thought, WTF? The first one is the main one that I think most people will have noticed and genuinely asked the question. What were they thinking? OK, Superman had left Metropolis to find the remains of his home planet which had apparently been discovered by astronomers. This was something that had happened after Superman 4, and now he returns to jump back into the job he abandoned and make friends with the bitter Lois Lane. This is what annoyed me. Lois Lane, for whatever reason had suddenly forgotten that Clark Kent was Superman? Forgive me if I'm wrong here but didn't she find out his real identity in the first Superman Movie? I know this film wasn't billed as an actual sequel, but if you're going to name a movie Superman Returns, and it's released 28 years after the original Superman movie then you have to at least keep it consistent because you have a lot of people at least expecting a bit of a sequel feel to it.<br /><br />The other thing I wanted to poke at was something another reviewer has also mentioned. This is a comic book movie, correct? This is a movie based on a man from another planet who's pretty much invincible, correct? Then why is it that with this sequel they had the beauty of CGI and the ability to bring a crazy villain (rather than Luthor) to go against Superman. Why don't we get some real comic book action in this film? Spiderman did it, The Incredible Hulk has done it, hell even the Dark Knight has done it. So why did Superman not bother? Why did Singer, Harris & Dougherty decide to give us a soap operatic movie that simply, Superman fans weren't after. Sure the Lois reunion would have been cool and to see her moved on would have been interesting, but this was the whole damn movie. Superman returns to Earth to find that a bitter Lois had written a Pulitzer prize winning article on "Why the Earth doesn't need Superman." Lois has moved on and she's now in a new relationship with the unlikeable Richard played by James Marsden and has a child to him. Sure a new relationship storyline is fun and all but this consumed the entire movie and the Lex Luthor's insane plot was overshadowed by that.<br /><br />That's not the icing on the cake, you're going to love this ridiculousness. The kid, while on a boat being kidnapped by Luthor, along with Lois by the way. Lois is being approached by one of the henchmen who's ready to beat the crap out of her, then BAM!!! out of nowhere a piano flies into the face of the henchman. So the child is the child of Superman, remember Lois can't remember who Superman really is, she's forgotten. Nothings confirmed though, you see it could have been just one of those crazy feats of strength that you hear people have on the news.<br /><br />I've got nothing else to say, apart from this is THE worst superhero movie EVER. I know that may be a bit of an exaggeration, but I can assure you I'm not. This is even worse than the Batman & Robin movie from 1997 because at least that had more fighting and action. In Superman Returns we were presented with about three major action scenes and they were literally no longer than 5 minutes. Brandon Routh can make a good Superman and Spacey a good Luthor. Bosworth needs to be dropped as she's just terrible as Lois Lane. I'm only hoping that in the sequel entitled Man of Steel (the DC movies are creating a theme with comic book movies now, just look at The Dark Knight, sequel to Batman Begins) the cast have another bout of amnesia and the child and the poor relationship are forgotten about and we can be given a real comic book movie from the new Superman. I would like to see an intergalactic villain in the sequel, maybe Metallo or Doomsday?<br /><br />Terrible movie, stay away.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Terminator 3 - Rise of the Machines (2-Disc Full Screen Edition)"></head><body><p>John Connor now exists only as a drifter living 'off the grid', so no more Terminators from the future can hunt him down. Unfortunately, SkyNet does send another one back and this one is called the T-X, even more powerful and advanced than the dreaded T-1000. However, another CSM-101 Terminator is also sent back to protect John against the T-X. Now, Skynet is patiently assuming control of civilian computer systems, under the guise of a computer virus. John has also met his future wife, Kate Brewster, whose father a U.S. Air Force General is in charge of the military computer systems & is leery of up linking SkyNet. However, when the SkyNet virus infects the U.S military computers and leaves the country open to attack, the machines begin their horrific takeover. Soon a nuclear war will result and the war against the machines will begin. T3 is a solid movie for a third installment. This movie is good enough to watch more than once.</p></body></html>

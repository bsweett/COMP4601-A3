<meta name="summary" content="Walt Disney's crowning film achievement"></head><body><p>Is there anyone left on the planet who does not know MARY POPPINS?  Made in 1963-1964, after a thirty year battle to convince a very stubborn and possessive P. L.  Travers  to give Walt Disney the rights to her book(s), it may be the Disney Studios' crowning film achievement.  It is a wonderful movie, a flawless blend of live action and animation, with some of the most beautiful and detailed matte paintings in movie history.  Julie Andrews, who won a Best Actress Oscar in her film debut, is the perfect nanny in 1910 Edwardian England to Jane and Michael Banks (Karen Dotrice and Matthew Garber).  And the movie won four other technical and music Oscars, with a still untopped thirteen total nominations.<br /><br />With chimney sweep/street artist/best buddy Bert (Dick Van Dyke in peak form), Mary Poppins leads Jane and Michael on many magical adventures.  These include a live-action/animation day in the park ("Supercalifragilisticexpealidocis"), a tea party on a ceiling with Ed Wynn as Uncle Albert, the hauntingly beautiful "Feed the Birds" with bird woman Jane Darwell, and the Oscar-winning "Chim-Chim-Curree" on the rooftops of London.  (Peter Ellenshaw allegedly did 100 breathtakingly beautiful and detailed matte paintings for this movie, winning a well-deserved visual effects Oscar.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Banks family is controlled like clockwork by Mr. Banks (a perfectly cold and stuffy David Tomlinson, who turns 180 degrees over the movie's fast-paced 140 minutes.  (Cotton Warburton won an Editing Oscar.)  Glynis Johns is an ideal and likeable suffragette and feminist Mrs. Banks.  Mr. Banks works in the bank and constantly wants his kids to open a bank account, but they are always off playing with Mary Poppins or  Bert.<br /><br />MARY POPPINS is a fabulous feast of a movie, with some of the greatest visual effects and most beautiful matte paintings I have ever seen.  The cast is perfection, the writing something that even grouchy Pamela Travers should be pleased with.  And the 40th anniversary restoration on DVD has shimmeringly rich color, crystal-clear image clarity, and awesome 5.1 Home Theatre Mix THX sound to top any theater sound system.<br /><br />Disk 2 runs over three hours and includes composer Richard Sherman giving us deleted songs that ended up in other Disney animated movies, were cut for sheer length on a movie that runs almost two-and-a-half hours without them, and chats with Julie Andrews and Dick Andrews.  A full hour behind-the-scenes documentary shows how most of the magnificent visual effects were achieved, should you want the illusion spoiled.  We see the battle to get P.L. Travers to let Walt Disney film her precious baby of a novel over three full decades and working over the screenplay to make it all seamless plot-wise.  Finally, we have long lost footage of the Grauman's Chinese Theatre Los Angeles world premiere in August 1964 and various movie trailers for those who want to know how this very magical masterpiece was marketed.<br /><br />The two-disk 40th anniversary DVD of MARY POPPINS belongs in every house with kids--and kids at  heart.  With it, a hundred filmmaking aspects come together perfectly to create a masterpiece that gets my vote as Walt Disney's crowning film achievement.</p></body></html>

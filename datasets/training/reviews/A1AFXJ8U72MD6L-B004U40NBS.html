<meta name="summary" content="ENGAGING CHARACTER PIECE"></head><body><p>This film received an AA nomination for Best Picture. Tale focuses on a young ballerina who gets the major part as the Swan Queen (in Tchaikovsky's SWAN LAKE) but there is an issue as to whether she has the personality for the Black Swan. The stress only increases her mental illness which leads to a sometimes wonderfully creepy experience. Cassel does a great job as the head honcho of the studio, exhibiting a difficulty artist personality who you have to listen to if you want to have a career.<br /><br />Good focus on the subcultural life of ballet, especially in body expressions. Winona Ryder has a small part in this film (yes, she's still around). I thought they were going to ruin the ending but they pulled it off. Portman won Best Actress for this picture and the director was nominated.<br /><br />CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; STORY/PLOTTING: B plus; BALLET SUBCULTURE: B plus; MY GRADE: B plus; WHEN WATCHED: end of August 2011.</p></body></html>

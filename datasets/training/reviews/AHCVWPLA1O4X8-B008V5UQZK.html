<meta name="summary" content="A romantic comedy about cultural values"></head><body><p>This is an interesting spin on the comedy/romance genre.  Unlike your typical 'chick-flick,' My Big Fat Greek Wedding is a story about culture clash and family values.  Toula, a 30-year old, unmarried Greek woman who is somewhat ashamed of her heritage, meets and falls in love with a young American named Ian.  What follows is a humorous story of their developing love and Toula's struggle to make her family understand.<p>So why only three stars?  Well, the movie is funny, but not THAT funny.  In fact, it's only mildly amusing.  Aside from the Windex joke (which was very cool), there is little to laugh at in this movie.  And, as far as the love story goes, there is hardly any chemistry between Toula and Ian.  In fact, the love story is horribly underdeveloped.<p>Lots of people think this movie is downright hilarious, so it's worth your time to check it out.  I wasn't particularly impressed, but then again I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies anyway. Either way, it's worth watching at least once.</p></body></html>

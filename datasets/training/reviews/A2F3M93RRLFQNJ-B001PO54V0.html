A pleasure from start to finish, it is actually more than a great musical...it is a great movie.  Small wonder it ranks on the AFI list of best movies as number 10 and also finishes in the AFI top twenty for comedies and romances.<p>Is it a perfect movie?  Well, that may be saying too much, but I can't think of a single flaw.  Even the Broadway Melody/Gotta Dance sequence which I used to think was overly long as a kid now seems as great as the rest of the movie.  But my single favorite scene (and I doubt I'm far from alone here) is Gene Kelly dancing and singing the title song.<p>I don't want to overly hype the movie and create unrealistic expectations, but I do think this can be enjoyed by almost anyone; although fifty years old, it is still as fresh as anything made today.</p></body></html>

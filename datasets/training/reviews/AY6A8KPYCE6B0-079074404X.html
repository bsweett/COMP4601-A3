<meta name="summary" content="Anne Francis Stars in Forbidden Planet (Blu Ray Review)"></head><body><p>Before I get to my review of the Picture/Sound quality of the blu ray release, let me say that this was my first time to ever see Forbidden Planet.  As far as the movie goes, I liked it very much.  But considering it is still considered a classic some 50 years later, you probably already knew it was good.<br /><br />I'm also not a techie, but after discovering the magic of blu ray I haven't turned back and have become somewhat of a 1080p snob.  If it's not blu, I don't watch it.  So I feel fairly confident when I say that I thought the picture quality was outstanding.  I've seen great transfers and I've seen some alright transfers, Forbidden Planet probably wasn't at the top, but it wasn't anywhere close to the bottom.<br /><br />The dark void of space was crisp and vivid and Anne Francis' marvelous short dresses dazzle with color.  In fact, the picture quality was so clear that I could (unfortunately) see that Anne was wearing a skin-colored suit as she started to emerge from the pond.  For some fans, no doubt, this might be considered a bad thing.<br /><br />Likewise the audio was sharp and clear, a lossless 5.1 DTS-HD MA release that won't test your system but it will greatly enhance the classic movie watching experience.<br /><br />All in all, I'm so glad I was able to take part in watching a Hollywood classic with today's amazing HD technology.  I can see now why it was influential enough for The Rocky Horror Picture Show to reference it!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="It takes a lot of hell to smell like heaven"></head><body><p>Even after reading the book, Perfume is the kind of a movie that can still shock and send chills down the spine. The story of a man born with no scent of his own but on a constant hunt for something that he can capture and anoint with to fit in is magnetic. I have never heard of a more interesting take on the world of scent mixed in with murder.<br /><br />Ben Whishaw  as Jean-Baptiste Grenouille was enigmatic, quiet, spooky, passionate and evil. I traveled though a flurry of emotions for him and his victims, knowing that his quest was very interesting yet it left a trail of despair and broken hearts of those who lost their loved ones. Death in the name of beauty if not a new phenomenon but it certainly is twisted when someone else has to pay the price. Alan Rickman, who also  plays Snape in Harry Potter movies, brings his uniqueness into the tale. The timber of his voice fits perfectly with the whole ethereal feel of the movie. His ruby haired daughter played by Rachel Hurd-Wood is Laura, the final ingredient on Grenouille's list to a heavenly scent.<br /><br />18th century France comes alive in this fantastic movie. I have never seen so much filth, dirt and grease in any costume movie but it was all worth it, and I swear my senses of smell were heightened for hours after watching it. The extremely long list of makeup artists at the end credits confirmed my suspicion that this was done with meticulous care to breath more life into the story.  The soundtrack is marvelous, the scenery breathtaking and everything simply tingles with richness. This movie is enigmatic, there's not question about it but I enjoyed the subtlety and the shocks it caused, unless you jump and sweat what good was wasting all that time watching TV?<br /><br />- Kasia S.</p></body></html>

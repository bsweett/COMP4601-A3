<meta name="summary" content="Truly Magical!"></head><body><p>This film is never disappointing. It allows you to immerse yourself in a simpler time when magic still seems like a possibility.<br /><br />And clearly I was not the only one impressed by this movie. It was nominated for a staggering 13 Academy Awards in 1965 and proceeded to win 5 including: Julie Andrews for Best Actress in a Leading Role; Peter Ellenshaw, Hamilton Luske and Eustace Lucett for Best Effects, Special Visual Effects, Cotton Warburton for Best Film Editing, and Richard B. Sherman and  Robert B. Sherman for Best Music, Score - Substantially Original, as well as Best Music, Song. It also won a number of other awards including Golden Globes, Grammys and BAFTAs. Dick Van Dyke, who unfortunately didn't receive an Academy Award nomination, was nominated for the Best Actor award in the Golden Globes, but was unsuccessful.<br /><br />Julie Andrews is Mary Poppins who, by unusual circumstances and highly original transportation, arrives at 17 Cherry Tree Lane to take up the role as nanny to Jane (Karin Dotrice) and Michael (Matthew Garber) who are the children of banker George Banks (David Tomlinson) and his suffragette wife Winifred (Glynis Johns). Mary Poppins, together with her friend Bert (Dick Van Dyke), a local street musician and chimney sweep, proceeds to take the children through a magical journey. Along the way she teaches George something about his values, and what the truly important things in his life are.<br /><br />Mary Poppins showcases excellent performance by all the leading players, and is a classic movie by any standard.</p></body></html>

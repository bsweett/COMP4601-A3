Each viewing will bring a different perspective.  Kevin Spacey takes the role of verbal painting a perfect changing picture. Director Bryan Singer is a great visionary.  His ability to translate ideas to film is astounding.  I don't understand why he hasn't had more films.<p>The best part of the Special Edition is Special Features.  Before entering the special features section I recommend watching the movie two or three times.  Form a good opinion on the plot and the characters.  Then endulge for the directors and actors point of view.</p></body></html>

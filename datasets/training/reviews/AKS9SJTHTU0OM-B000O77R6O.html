<meta name="summary" content="A moving, creative, visually stunning, metaphysical look at love and life"></head><body><p>Leave it to me to love this often trashed film even more than Aronofsky's strong<br />'Requiem for a Dream' . (although a solid minority of critics went for it too).<br /><br />Just as experimental as 'Requiem' and 'Pi', but with a more complex,<br />humanistic, metaphysical message, here all Aronofsky's visual pyrotechnics<br />(and the film does look amazing) feel like a means to an end not an end in<br />themselves.<br /><br />A love story that takes place in 3 time frames (the 1500s as a<br />conquistador hunts for the source of life, the 'fountain of youth', the<br />present where the same man, now a scientist tries to find a cure for<br />cancer before his beloved wife dies and 500 years in the future, where<br />the same man again is with his love, who is now a tree, still looking<br />for eternal life.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weitz are terrific, and I the score is creative and<br />effective. Ultimately a very moving look at the nature of life and<br />death. Yes there are a few pretentious moments, but I'll take slightly<br />flawed grand ambitions to explore something in a new way - ala '2001'<br />over the same old, same old every time.<br /><br />(possible spoilers ahead)<br /><br />The fact that the past and future segments are part of a fairy tale<br />book started by the dying woman and finished by the scientist seemed<br />very obvious to me, but seemed to leave a shocking number of critics<br />scratching their heads,confused as to which story is 'real'. I can see why,<br />if you miss that, the film could seem confusing and arbitrary, but<br />it's laid out pretty clearly along the way,</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef return."></head><body><p>Clint Eastwood and Lee van Cleef return in this third film which follows A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS (1964) and FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE (1966). Eli Wallach as &quot;Tuco&quot; is the ugly one. Also with Aldo Giuffre and Mario Brega.<br /><br /> The catchy tune that we have grown to know by Ennio Morricone is in this film. Lyrics by Tommie Connor for the song, &quot;The Soldiers Story&quot;.<br /><br /> Eli Wallach knows where some money is buried. he only knows the name of the cemetary. Clint eastwood knows the name of the grave. This grave contains $200,000. &quot;Tuco&quot; calls the Man With No Name, &quot;Blondie&quot;.<br /><br /> Best of the film series and very clever finale.<br /><br /> The follow-up film (without Clint Eastwood) is: ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST (1968).<br /><br /> DVD includes Theatrical trailer. Separatly, this DVD will show you the 7 Italian deleted scenes, 14 minutes in all, never-before-seen.</p></body></html>

Many deal with zombies, ghosts, serial killers, classic monsters like Frankenstein, and mutated species. Some are classic, others are mediocre, and several are ridiculous and dull. Out of all of them, only a few have been recognized as the greatest in the genre. The Exorcist, Psycho, and The Shining have been rightfully praised for the terrors that they have conveyed. Dozens of others have never topped them ever since they were released. While my favorite horror film of all time is actually The Shining, I can perfectly understand why The Exorcist is considered the best. First of all, is has an unusual storyline (back in the 70's, at least). Instead of ghosts or zombies or werewolves, it's demon possession. The body of a young girl is being controlled by a spirit from Hell. With every medical analysis being inconclusive, the mother has one last chance of bringing her daughter back. She brings in Father Karras, who has a crisis of faith, and Father Merrin, who has seen this sort of prediction when he visited Iraq.<br /><br />So why is it that this is considered the scariest movie of all time. Well, the shock effects may be outdated to some, but it's the eerie atmosphere and the thought of being possessed that makes it truly horrifying. The silent, quick shots of the infamous "Captain Howdy" are also an addition to this ghoulish nightmare. You don't need loud and abrupt music or hardcore gore, all you need here is a creepy environment, a slow pace, and some fiendish dialogue from Regan/the demon. Mind you, there are some great modern horror films (such as Rec, The Evil Dead series, and the original Thai version of Shutter), but The Exorcist, The Shining, and Psycho are in top form when it comes to scaring the s*** out of you. The Exorcist, especially, is one that is truly scary because of its controversial subject matter. The finest, no doubt.<br /><br />Grade: A+</p></body></html>

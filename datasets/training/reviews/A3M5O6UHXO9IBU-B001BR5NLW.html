I wouldn't go that far (Dune/ Farscape, et al) but his idiosyncratic style rather won me over. I'm not sure if the character of Riddick (from Pitch Black) ever justifies the portentious deification Twohy affords him, but the possibly tragic ending is none the less intriguing. Beautifully shot, the story dares to be dark although I fear it may be too lumbering and lugabrious to withstand too many repeat viewings. I do think it was a mistake to recast Jack. The original actress had huge Bambi eyes and it's difficult to connect emotionally with a different actress. Finally, watch out for a cheeky Roy Batty/Rutger Hauer tribute scene.</p></body></html>

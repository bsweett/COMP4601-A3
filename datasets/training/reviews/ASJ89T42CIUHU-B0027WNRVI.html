<meta name="summary" content="A Great Monster Mash!"></head><body><p>This grand monster hunt comes to life as Van Helsing and pays tribute to all the truly great classic monsters while remaining visually interesting enough for all of today's special effects enthusiasts.<br /><br />The movie begins in a creepy castle, filmed in black and white, and we meet Dr. Frankenstein, his Monster, Dracula and Igor as all the fun begins. Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) is busy in Paris battling a nasty but large Mr. Hyde atop Notre Dame Cathedral. Meanwhile across Europe, and in a little country called Transylvania, a brave and daring heroine (Kate Beckinsale) has hopes of saving her brother from life as a Wolfman. All of the greats are represented here (minus the Mummy) and the story is both interesting and classically told.<br /><br />Stephen Sommers has made a visually beautiful and classic monster film paying fantastic tribute to all those who came before him. The special effects are quite good and you will find yourself transported into a really good video game that allows one to discover something different every time this film is seen. Jackman is the perfect hero as the title character being handsome, strong and silly all at the same time. Kate Beckinsale brings the typical frail heroine into a new light as the strong and feisty Princess Anna. The main nemesis is Dracula, played humorously by Richard Roxburgh. Dracula's brides are sexy, evil and quite vicious. Will Kemp plays the Wolfman and looks great out of costume! Igor (Kevin J. O'Connor) comes to life with the perfect blend of humor and snide remarks but sadly no flies and finally the Frankenstein Monster (Shuler Hensley) finally has a voice and uses it well. Altogether the cast in this film is highly entertaining and the storyline quite interesting. Of course the special effects in this film often override true human talent but they are well worth your time.<br /><br />This film is fun, entirely entertaining and beautiful to watch unfold while at the same time being a wonderful tribute to all of the classic monsters. A great film for the family that doesn't take monsters (and fighting them) too literally. Sommers has mastered the ability to take traditional monster movies and spin them into a new form while paying proper tribute to the original. I suspect Van Helsing will emerge as the new hero of modern monster films and foresee a sequel ready to be bolted into life.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="I REMEMBER GOING OPENING NIGHT AT WILDWOOD BY THE SEA!"></head><body><p>I can still smell the salt and anticipation in the air as my friend and I waited in line to see Jaws on opening night! We were first in a very long line,the film would not disappoint anyone there that night! We were so impressed we went back the next night, with a few more friends in tow. We just wanted to see our unsuspecting friends and the audience lose there precious popcorn every time Bruce the shark would briefly appear. The famous head scene is the biggest jolt and it scared the you know what out of everyone in the theater! Living in Wildwood N.J. one block from the ocean, made the film all the more real and it kept most of us from enjoying the ocean for quite some time. To this day, over 30 years later! I do not feel completely at ease when I'm in the ocean and my feet leave the ocean floor! That is some impact for a film to have over a man who has watched so many really scary movies.<br /><br />I own both the 25th and the 30th anniversary editions and I watch one of them almost on a yearly basis. I have a 10 foot screen in my home theater and it is almost like opening night every time I watch it! One of the best films ever made and probably the scariest. The 30th anniversay edition is the better edition with original mono soundtrack and complete documentary, but beware!... the 30th ann. edition does not include the theatrical trailer! This is inexcusable! Even so, the extra length of the documentary and the original and DTS soundtrack make this a worthy upgrade. If you don't own the 25th ann. then the 30th ann. You might want to keep your 25th ann. for the trailer :-( .....da....dum.......da dum.....</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Fast-moving fiction"></head><body><p>It is very difficult for me to rate this film.  On one level it is a fast-paced thriller which, in a quite entertaining manner, depicts many  different people in search of the same goal, Dan Brown's version of the Holy Grail.  On another level, it is a movie built on fantasy, an attention-grabbing chronicle based on false premises and half-truths which attempt to undermine the Christian church's view of Jesus Christ.  This factor nagged at me throughout the film and I was not able to just forget about it and enjoy the movie as so many people advocate.  Debates have raged over the movie and the book, but the attack on the divinity of Christ is an insurmountable barrier for me, and the thought of profiting from these untruths makes this film a disturbing one for me.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="a short, quick thriller"></head><body><p>One look at the running time of this movie (only 85 minutes) and you know you're not going to see a movie of much substance.  This is a one trick movie, the plot is just what you expect, there are no twists and turns.  Still, its not a bad film.  The strenghth of the movie is between lead actors Rachel McAdams (Wedding Crashers) and Cillian Murphy.  They meet while their flight from Dallas to Miami is delayed.  They hit it off and have a great relationship and even end up sitting together on the plane.  Coincidence?  No, of course not.<br /><br />Murphy quickly reveals he has alterior motives.  His job is to force McAdams to call the hotel where she works and have a important political figure's room changed to one easily accessible to assassins.  To make things worse, bad guys have McAdam's dad and if she doesn't obey, he'll be killed.<br /><br />I liked this movie and at the same time it was disappointing.  It was short and the plot was as basic as they come.  There were some tense moments and Rachel McAdams and Murphy were fun to watch.</p></body></html>

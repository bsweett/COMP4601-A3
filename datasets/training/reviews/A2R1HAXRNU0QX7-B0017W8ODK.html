<meta name="summary" content="Despite good performances...left me cold and frustrated."></head><body><p>I have never read ATONEMENT (although I own the book, it has somehow never made it to my nightstand), so I brought no preconceived expectations, except that the story was emotionally shattering and the ending is supposed to be a mindblower.<br /><br />Based on the movie, neither expectation was even close to being met. This is the story of the Tallis family, whom we meet in 1935, at their country estate in England.  Oldest daughter Cecilia (Keira Knightley) is secretly but chastely in love with young Robbie (James McAvoy), the son of the housekeeper, who apparently received a scholarship to a good school as a young man, and actually is anticipating going to medical school.  These two have obviously known each other for years, and the heat between them is just starting to really get cranked up.  This is unfortunate, because on this particular day, Cecilia's 13 year-old sister Briony seems to be making a habit of being in the wrong place at the wrong time.  She is an aspiring writer, and clearly thinks very highly of herself.  While both sisters clearly are children of privilege and have a somewhat haughty attitude, young Briony is also a smart child whose self-esteem has probably been inflated to an inappropriate level.<br /><br />So the heat turns up on the two young lovers, and Briony is there to not only read a note from Robbie to Cecilia, but to catch them in a couple of intimate acts.  She misunderstands what she is reading and seeing, and this leads to disaster for Cecilia, and particularly for Robbie, who is accused of a horrible crime and sent to prison.<br /><br />This covers nearly the first half of the film, and this part of the film is quite compelling.  It's well-written, very well acted and oozes with atmosphere.  We feel everyone simply languishing...bored and open to getting into trouble.  It's dramatic stuff, and when the "act" ends with Robbie arrest, we anticipate an escalation of events and emotions that will take this film to the "shattering" levels.<br /><br />And here's where the film falls nearly completely apart.  Robbie is allowed into the army after 4 years in prison, and we see him at Dunkirk, the site of the historic evacuation of British troops from the mainland back to England.  This daring and costly evacuation of hundreds of thousands of troops was a turning point in the early days of the war...if the evacuation had failed, Britain would have been routed, and Germany could have invaded the island.  As a viewer, we are told none of this...we had just better know it.  However, we are instead allowed to follow Robbie as he wanders through some fields, sees some horrific sights and generally looks like a guy who has been through hell.  There is a scene on the beach that shows us the immensity of what the troops face.  It is about 5 minutes long and is done in one long take.  Technically, it is truly impressive...dramatically, it serves almost no purpose.  It shows off for no reason.<br /><br />Back in England, we see that Cecilia has become a head nurse and is estranged from her family.  Briony, a nurse-in-training, continues to write and apparently is still eaten up by guilt at what she has caused...because now, of course, she believes that what she saw was mis-interpreted.<br /><br />So we see some scenes of these three characters grappling with the ware.  So is this a war movie?  Why so much emphasis on the war when what we've been led to be interested in is these three characters...who play second fiddle to the war for nearly an hour.  War scenes are certainly inherently interesting, but in ATONEMENT they should be supplementing our understanding of the characters not overwhelming them.  By the time the brief third act starts, and all the surprises are revealed, we have pretty much stopped caring about the characters.  And the surprises really aren't that surprising.  The whole tone of the movie, and the way it has played around with time makes it a bit unsurprising when the truth is revealed.  I won't say I saw it coming...but I also didn't really feel surprised.  My wife felt the same.<br /><br />Another problem is the character Briony.  She is unlikeable throughout the film, at all ages.  We aren't given a reason to sympathize with her, as she goes from arrogance to cowardice to regret.  Big deal...none of those feelings compare to the damage she has wrought.<br /><br />Everyone does a decent acting job, and technically the film is accomplished.  But director Joe Wright doesn't handle the tone of the film well enough for us to accept all the shifts and leaps.  And without knowing the book, I have to say that the script, particularly later in the game, is pedestrian and truly fails its characters.  It's almost like the first half of the movie and the second half were written and directed by different people.<br /><br />I can't say I cared much for the film.  It's been nominated for a lot of awards, so clearly others will react to it with more affection.  But it left me cold.</p></body></html>

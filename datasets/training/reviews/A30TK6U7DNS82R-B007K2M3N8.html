<meta name="summary" content="Vanity, Thy Name Is Spacey"></head><body><p>I usually have a soft spot for the "pet projects" of the stars, even when they fail spectacularly, like Marlon Brando's ONE EYED JACKS or Barbra Streisand's YENTL.  Even when they're bad you feel something's at stake, that passion is involved.  John Wayne wore all his hats for THE ALAMO (1960) and when America didn't embrace it as enthusiastically as he had hoped, it broke his spirit, embittered him a little.  And some stars never even have pet projects--do you think Elizabeth Taylor ever really cared about what movie she was making?  It was the old factory mentality for Liz, punch in, punch out, bye, have a nice weekend.  Thus I really wanted to like BEYOND THE SEA and when I didn't, I finally figured out the problem.  It was the pet project of a star who isn't really a star, and inside this bright jewelbox of a film is nobody you can really care about.<br /><br />These projects are all about vanity and Spacey must never get bored with hearing how much he's like Bobby Darin, singing, dancing, acting, they even look alike with that fake little nose-strip he's got pasted on his face in this film.  Was turning the picture into a meta-fictional 8 1/2 meditation on fame and disease the wise thing to do?  Oh, who knows, it gives the movie a startling beginning and provides a "reason" for those spectacular sub-ALL THAT JAZZ dance sequences that keep popping up every ten minutes or so (BEYOND THE SEA, UP A LAZY RIVER, etc), numbers without a lick of sense to them or even any real choreography.  At least ALL THAT JAZZ had Bob Fosse.  BEYOND THE SEA's got-- Kevin Spacey of course (and Rob Ashford, the Broadway choregrapher whose dances for THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE five years ago had everyone gasping in despair).<br /><br />The truth is, the BobbY Darin story was done much better in VALLEY OF THE DOLLS, and the actor playing Tony Polar (the late lamented Tony Scotti) was more like Darin than Spacey will ever be.  Darin's romance with brilliant and tragic Sandra Dee is already amply chronicled in the magnificent trilogy of Universal films they made together, COME SEPTEMBER, IF A MAN ANSWERS, and the superb THAT FUNNY FEELING.  Watch any of these shows instead, they'll bring you more love.</p></body></html>

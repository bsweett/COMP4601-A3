<meta name="summary" content="Successful creation of a comic strip adventure"></head><body><p>If the concept of an action filled comic book style adventure leaves you cold avoid this picture. If it can amuse and entertain you, then this will be satisfying. The characters are consistent, well formed, and authentic within the logic of its generic type; that is, they act logically in terms of the premise. Stunts are quite well done while the hardware is anything but penny-board masquerading as space ships. All looks as it should look in such an adventure. I have no idea of which age and sex groups it will most interest, but is is certain to have wide appeal.</p></body></html>

It can't be easy to make a movie showing your country's destruction and acknowledging the atrocities your own countrymen committed.  The fact that Germany won't allow publication or importing of Mein Kampf even as an historical document has always suggested to me a national desire to just pretend the events of the past never happened.  For obvious reasons, I was exceedingly interested in watching this film.  How would Hitler be portrayed?  Would there be any mention of the Holocaust?  I had these and many other questions.  All those questions were answered with a surprisingly nuanced film of great complexity and depth.<br /><br />Downfall chronicles not only Hitler's last days inside the bunker but the immediate aftermath of his death and Germany's surrender.  To a significant degree, that story is reflected through the eyes of Traudl Junge, one of Hitler's personal secretaries.  Video clips of an interview with the elderly Junge from Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary (2002) frame the presentation (ringing rather hollow, if you ask me - but that's really neither here nor there).  In the claustrophobic confines of Hitler's bunker, we witness the final days of the already broken Fuhrer, the individual dramas of those in Hitler's inner circle as they wrestle with the decision to leave or stay, and the total destruction of German society along with National Socialism.<br /><br />The treatment of Hitler is, to my mind, exceedingly well done.  Hitler was a much more complicated man than many give him credit for.  His personal demons came to consume him, but there was a human side to the man, as well - and this film brings that out in a very nuanced way.  This is not to say that Downfall makes of Hitler a sympathetic character - not in the slightest.  His hate and venom are never far from the forefront, but this actually stands to reinforce his exceedingly human weaknesses.  His mood swings are severe, especially as the end draws near - and he's not always rational.  Betrayal drives him into a fury, especially the ultimate betrayal by Himmler.  Yet he remains lucid enough to plan his death in an effort to keep his remains out of the hands of the Russians.<br /><br />Almost as fascinating as Hitler himself, in both history as well as this film, are the Goebbels.  Joseph Goebbels himself remained loyal to the very end, and it can be said that his wife Magda was even more dedicated to Hitler and National Socialism than he was.  She, after all, killed all six of her children rather than let them grow up in a world without National Socialism - and that scene proves to be the most riveting of the entire film.  Eva Braun is an almost extraordinary character in the film; maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think the filmmakers gave an accurate picture of her at all.<br /><br />Then there are the military leaders who watch Hitler give orders their decimated armies cannot possibly follow.  Loyalty is a powerful force in these men's lives - but their loyalty is to Germany rather than Hitler himself.  For this reason, they are the ones asking Hitler to spare the German people and to think about ending the war.  For some, though, the distaste of Germany's surrender from World War I overrides everything else in their determination to fight to the death - and I think that was a most telling point for the film to make.  The only real problem I had with the film was the fact that I was hard pressed to identify several of the most prominent characters.  All of the actors were made to resemble the men they played, but - even though I'm familiar with most of the historical figures - I really couldn't figure out the identities of several characters over the course of the film.<br /><br />You may be wondering if the film actually shows Hitler's suicide on the screen - I wondered that myself.  Unfortunately, I'm not going to tell you how the scene plays out.  You will find a significant number of fairly graphic scenes in the film, though.  It truly is a realistic presentation of Germany's darkest days, with the increasingly devastating destruction of Berlin going hand in hand with the physical and mental breakdown of the man ultimately responsible for it all.  Honestly, I never expected any German filmmaker to produce such an honest, complex, awe-inspiring motion picture about their most infamous national leader.  Downfall is a must-see.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="This is NOT your sappy Spielberg!"></head><body><p>In the past, Spielberg was well-known for delivering two kinds of movie:  the (often sappy) feel-good movie like &quot;E.T.&quot; and the dark, devastating film like &quot;Schindler's List.&quot;  Lately, he has begun to mature as a director/producer with offerings that give the viewer more variety.  &quot;Minority Report&quot; is one of those films.  Set in the future that is recognizable just as often as it is not, Spielberg adds comedy to desperation, heart-felt grief to adventure, accident to calculated science.<p>The gist of the movie can be explained simply.  John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the chief of Pre-Crime, a police experiment that results in a murder-free Washington, D.C.  The secret behind the success of Pre-Crime is three &quot;pre-cogs&quot; who foresee murder before it happens, giving the police time to intervene.  When the pre-cogs finger John himself as a premeditated murderer even though he does not even know the supposed victim, he realizes his only hope is to run.<p>Although the special effects are interesting, they sometimes clutter a movie that is, after all, about predestination, exploitation, and the meaning of innocence.  We don't need a fantastical future to feel these themes.  While the futuristic cars and their highways are cool, a greenhouse of bizarre botanical specimens is too much, even to point out how far the geneticists of the future succeed in their quest to manipulate life.  The comedy in some of the darkest scenes works well as both relief and set-up of greater tension.<p>&quot;Minority Report&quot; contains some major holes, but all in all, comes off as an entertaining and, more importantly, original story. The characterization is surprisingly detailed for a sci-fi adventure, creating a future that feels more truthfully human than I expected.  The acting is generally solid, and the cinematography often above-average.  My biggest complaint about the DVD specifically was the quality of the sound - it never exploited the capabilities of my surround-sound system and often sounded dull.<p>&quot;Minority Report&quot; is an excellent choice for both teens and adults, especially for those who like a thrill with their flicks.</p></body></html>

We never really get to know any of the characters in the story in a deep or meaningful way. In fact, the children are presented so matter of factly that the viewer feels indifference toward their impending plight. Johnny Depp does a decent job as a somewhat dark, disturbed version of Willie Wonka. His quips to the children are funny but in most cases he is guilty of overacting. The best parts of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory are the flashbacks to Charlie's childhood. Here we learn about his father, Wilbur Wonka (played to perfection by Christopher Lee)  who is a dentist with an extreme dislike for any type of candy. The viewer also glimpses how Willie Wonka met and recruited the Oompa Loompa's to come and work in his factory which is an interesting side bar. I don't know, call me nostalgic but this version couldn't hold a candle to the original. Gene Wilder was absolute perfection and although Depp handles the role, this is clearly not one of his shining screen moments. I can relate to  Tim Burton's vision but to me there's just not enough heart in this one to make it a winner. Recommended(Barely).</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Visual Feast for a Time Travel Love Story"></head><body><p>Anytime a story is about time travel the audience must accept the fact that suspension of belief is mandatory.  Based on a Korean film 'Siworae' by Eun-Jeong Kim and Ji-na Yeo and adapted for the latest version by David Auburn, Alejandro Agresti has his work cut out for him.  The story is Swiss cheese full of holes as anyone would expect from a tale about two people who fall in love from the disparate vantages of 2004 and 2006 and as long as the viewer accepts the inherent incongruities of such a story the overall effect is really quite lovely, if a bit too uninvolving.<br /><br />Dr. Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock) has a history of living in a glass lake house outside Chicago but when we meet her she lives in a luxury apartment while she is on staff at a small hospital.  Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves) currently lives in the lake house (we discover that his father played by Christopher Plummer is an architect who built the house years ago) and begins to find mail in his mailbox from the previous tenant Kate.  The story weaves back and forth between 2004 and 2006 and keeping score is rather tricky at times, but eventually of course the two time-lapsed people meet, the riddles are unexplained, they fall in love over the distance of time, etc.  There is not a lot of message here except that real love can occur despite almost any obstacle.<br /><br />Reeves and Bullock are fine, but the rest of the characters are sketchy and only tangentially relevant to the story.  A family discourse among Reeves, Plummer, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach (Henry, the other brother) never gels.  The supporting cast includes interesting actors such as Shohreh Aghdashloo but they have little to do.  In fact the scenery and the house seem to be the main characters and that really is OK because both are beautiful, thanks to Alar Kivilo's cinematography, and Rachel Portman's musical score is very fine.  It is not a deep film and it could benefit from a really good re-write of the script, but for an evening's diversion it is pretty to look at and tender in content.  Just forget about the holes and you'll be fine.  Grady Harp, September 06</p></body></html>

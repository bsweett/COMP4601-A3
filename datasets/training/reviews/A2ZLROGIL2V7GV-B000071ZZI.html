<meta name="summary" content="&quot;Everything I found out, I want to forget...&quot;"></head><body><p>I was in the mood to watch an entertaining action flick that hopefully had some brains behind it, so I decided to pop &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; into my DVD player (that, and the previews for the sequel looks really good, so I wanted to see this right away).  What I got was exactly what I expected, and then some.  This is a very exciting and sharp movie that is a lot of fun to watch.  There's lots of intense action to be enjoyed from this film.<p>Jason Bourne has a serious problem on his hands.  When he is left for dead and his body is discovered by fishermen, he awakes and realizes that he cannot remember who he is.  His memory is gone and he has no idea why or how he's there.  And even though he doesn't know who he is, he is very skilled at hand-to-hand combat and is a deadly weapon who can take down just about anyone.  When he tries to uncover his past and his identity, he finds people around every corner trying to kill him.  Turns out that he is in reality an agent/assassin for the U.S. government (a very secret branch of defense).  Since Bourne had failed his mission, they cannot afford to have him found out by others, so they know he must be terminated.  Well, Bourne isn't going to take that lightly.  He will take them head on and bring the fight to their doorsteps in order to find out who he is and why they want him dead.<p>This really was a good time.  I haven't been terribly impressed with some of the latest action blunders, so it was nice to see something that was entertaining and was actually smart at the same time.  Another plus is that the film doesn't try to be overly goofy, as a lot of other action flicks tend to be at times.  Granted, there is humor, but it's evenly spread out and is never overused.  Not only does the film have incredible action and fight scenes, but it also has a smart script and great character interaction.  The movie also shows that Matt Damon can be one heck of an action star.  I thought he could never pull it off, but he sure proved me wrong.  He's very believable in his role and he's able to pull of the action scenes with real authenticity.<p>The DVD has a few extras to offer.  First off, the movie looks very good and the sound is also terrific.  Extras that can be found on this DVD include commentary from the director, an alternate ending and an extended &quot;farmhouse&quot; scene, deleted scenes, a making-of featurette, a great music video by Moby, and some really neat DVD-ROM extras.  I didn't care much for the alternate ending, so I'm glad that they just stuck with what is in the movie.  All in all, not a bad package.<p>&quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; can be enjoyed by those who want a smart and clever action movie that delivers.  There's a great script, a fantastic cast, and some out-of-this-world chase/fight scenes.  This was definitely a great time for me and I'm glad I finally got around to watching it.  If you haven't checked it out yet, then I really recommend it, especially if you're an action fan. -Michael Crane</p></body></html>

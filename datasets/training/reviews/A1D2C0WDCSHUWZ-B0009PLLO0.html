<meta name="summary" content="Alexander the not-so-great"></head><body><p>Hollywood has rediscovered epics -- "Braveheart" and "Gladiator," and recently the tepid "Troy" and outstanding "Lord of the Rings" trilogy. Now we get "Alexander," an overwrought biopic about legendary conqueror Alexander the Great... or as he is shown here, Alexander the dewy-eyed pretty boy. Zeus help us.<br /><br />Alexander (Colin Farrell) was groomed for greatness as a boy, by his drunken oaf father (Val Kilmer) and his snake-worshiping mother Olympias (Angelina Jolie), who claimed he was the son of the god Zeus himself. And gradually Alexander became a legendary leader of armies.<br /><br />He married the fiery Persian princess Roxanne (Rosario Dawson) but was really in love with Hephaiston (Jared Leto), a friend of his who becomes more than just an old pal. And oh yeah, he also conquered the entire known world (at the time) before dying at the age of thirty-two.<br /><br />Too bad Baz Luhrmann ditched the idea of doing his own Alexander biopic -- assuredly he could only have made something better than the turgid "Alexander." The movie is the most inadvertantly funny thing I've seen in ages. Stone displays all the directorial subtlety of a sledgehammer, using tired cliches like flower petals, harps, snakes and an eagle.<br /><br />"Alexander" is pretty clearly not meant to be a comedy, yet the dialogue is really really funny. It has been decades since a film was so pompous and overwrought --  it has lines like "Conquer your fear and you will conquer death." The story itself isn't much better, focusing less on Alexander as a warrior and conquerer -- and skirting the moral debates of "the great" killing so many for his vision of unity.  Instead, we get his longings for Hephaiston, and his peculiar Oedipal vibe with Olympias. Oy. Stone could have shown Alexander with all his sins and flaws, but decided to purify his image.<br /><br />Which is a shame, since it definitely takes away from the epic quality. The battles are dull enough that I found myself looking at Farrell's dark roots and miniskirt toga. And while much ado is made is about the "brave" love story between Alexander and Hephaiston, Stone shies away from actually showing anything more than smoldering looks. Interesting, since he shows two women being raped onscreen, with Dawson going topless.<br /><br />That love story, which is the unofficial center of the film, is especially disappointing because Hephaiston is merely the object of Alexander's hormones. Stone could have shown them as more than just lovers -- Hephaiston as a friend, as a companion, as a pillar of support to a very stressed Alexander. Instead, he's just Jared Leto in eye makeup. So much for depth.<br /><br />Colin Farrell is a solid and talented young man. But for whatever reason, he just doesn't have the presence that Alexander requires. Not his fault -- he does his best. Leto has the presence of a dead fish, and Dawson does what she can with her underused role. Angelina Jolie is perhaps the most enjoyable to watch. Despite her Natasha Fatale accent, she vamps it up in an almost campy way.<br /><br />"Alexander" has some good acting by Farrell and its leading ladies, but sadly the whole film is a ridiculous, overwrought mess. Well, there's a reason Stone didn't call it "Alexander the Great." "Alexander the Grating" is more like it.</p></body></html>

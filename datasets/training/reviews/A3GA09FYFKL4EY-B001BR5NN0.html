I did find it somewhat unconvincing since the actors playing teenagers so obviously aren't, and the ending is disappointing. When they return to school on Monday nothing will have changed much. The outcasts will still be outcasts, and they'll all ignore each other despite the one-day of pseudo-bonding. Nice date movie though.</p></body></html>

A rarity, too often, in todays cinema.<br /><br />Nothing pretentious, or you might think preachy, about a young high school girl that reluctantly comes to the realization that she's pregant and goes through the gamant of feelings about what to do, all the while trying to maintain her confident, sarcastic attitude like nothing is bothering her.<br /><br />JUNO is real life and charm and you watch the film, forgetting that you're watching a film. You feel as though you're seeing yourselves or your neighbors living their lives.<br /><br />JUNO is written with tremendous wit and heart. The actors involved should all be commended and they will be rewarded with a film that will live on for ages. I've seen Michael Clayton, There Will be Blood & No Country for Old Men and without question, JUNO has been the movie that has made the biggest impact on society and will be watched 10 years from now.<br /><br />Then you throw in a killer soundtrack and people everywhere singing, "Anyone Else but You". Everything about JUNO is priceless.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A Fitting Conclusion"></head><body><p>This movie wraps up what actually turned out to be a decent trilogy. Both main storylines are compelling, and the conclusion offers a few actual surprises. The violence is brutal and some of the traps, as usual, are sadistically ingenious. Also included is some nice 'fill in the gaps of the previous films' material; This is a well-rounded, satisfying 'gorror' movie that lives up to the previous films reputations, and then some. I'm not sure the skull operation scene close ups were entirely needed, but hey...Plus these movies give you some interesting ideas to think about in terms of 'what have I really done with my life? what kind of person would Jigsaw say I am?'. I give these movies points for this, because at least they're trying to get you to think, even if it's on a semi-surface level, and often lost in a sea of blood and shredded pig corpses.</p></body></html>

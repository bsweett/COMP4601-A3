<meta name="summary" content="A must see Indiana Jones type movie!!!!"></head><body><p>I just rented this movie a few days ago and watched it. I thought it was dynamic! <p>Brendan Raser plays Rick O'Connell, an adventurer who knows where the 'city of the dead', Hamunaptra, is. A librarian Evelyn (Rachel Weisz) and her brother, Jonathan, convince Rick to lead them there: Jonathan so he can find the treasure of the pharoahs and Evelyn to find archaeological artifacts. Only when they get there, trouble immediately starts. Rick, Evelyn, and Jonathan carelessly resurrects the mummy of Imhotep when Evelyn reads from 'the book of the dead'. And not only has he become alive, he has the power to unleash the '10 plagues' and all the power of the gods. Rick, Evelyn, and Jonathan have to stop him, amidst fighting against undead warrior priests, flesh eating scarabs, and more!<p>It has all the characteristics of an Indiana Jones type movie, adventure, humor, and action. Except that &quot;The Mummy&quot; has something much more: Suspense. It wasn't just the horror that scared me, it was the suspense that got you. Almost half the time, I was watching &quot;The Mummy&quot; behind my pillow! Almost the whole movie they didn't really show anything, it was left up to your imagination. And I have a good imagination... Don't get me wrong, it WAS scary and suspenseful, yet there were plenty of funny parts which I was laughing so hard I was crying! I was actually impressed by Brendan Fraser's acting, too. I've seen him play in some really dumb movies like &quot;Dudley Do-Right&quot; and &quot;George of the Jungle&quot; so I didn't know what to expect from him playing in an adventure movie. And he did a great job! This is a good movie to watch while eating popcorn at night with the lights turned off at home. I really want to try to get this DVD. Also want to see what the sequel is like, &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot;...</p></body></html>

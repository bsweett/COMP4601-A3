<meta name="summary" content="The Ultimate Heroes"></head><body><p>Director Paul Greengrass brings the story of United flight 93 to life in this fitting tribute to the heroes aboard the flight who refused to go quietly.  On September 11, 2001, four commercial airliners were hijacked by middle eastern terrorists.  Two of the planes were flown into the World Trade Center, one hit the Pentagon, and the fourth, flight 93, was destined for another target, most likely the White House or the U.S. Capitol, but thanks to the heroic efforts of the passengers and crew, the flight never reached its intended target.<br /><br />This move shows all aspects of that terrible day in September.  From the opening scenes of the terrorists preparing themselves for death to the scenes in the confused and hectic air control rooms, this film revisits one of the darkest days in our history.<br /><br />The story of flight 93 is inspiring and serves as a beacon of light which continues to shine today for those who remember 9/11.  The depiction of the flight in the movie is very good.  The movie begins with the passengers and crew boarding the aircraft for what initially appeared to be a normal flight from Newark to San Fransisco.  However, in the control rooms across the country, a much different story was unfolding.  One of the controllers reported hearing screams and foreign voices from one of the planes.  This turned out to be United flight 11.  The controllers cointinued to monitor the flight until, mysteriously, the plane disappeared from the screen.  This was the first plane to hit the World Trade Center.<br /><br />Meanwhile, aboard flight 93, the four terrorists sprung their own hijacking.  Using a homemade bomb (which was really fake) and box cutters, the terrorists managed to gain entrance into the cockpit and contol of the plane.  Immediately, the terrorists turned the plane around and began heading back east.  Several passenegrs, including the pilot and co-pilot, were stabbed by the terrorists.  Some of the passengers began making cell phone calls to loved ones on the ground, and in the process, they learned about the attacks on the WTC.  Realizing that their plane was probably going to be used in the same way as the ones which struck the WTC, the passengers began to formulate a plan to re-take the plane from the terrorists.  Despite the heroic efforts of the passengers and crew, the plane crashed in western Pennsylvania, about 10 minutes' flying time from Washington, D.C.  No one survived.<br /><br />This movie serves as  a stirring tribute to those heroic souls who banded together and fought to save not only themselves, but perhaps hundreds of others as well.  I was impressed with the coverage of the air traffic controllers and how they struggled with handling the hijackings.  It was both amazing and somewhat heart-wrenching seeing these dedicated people doing their best to ensure the safety of the people aboard the hijacked planes.<br /><br />The acting in the movie is very good.  Christian Clemenson (Tom Burnett), Cheyenne Jackson (Mark Bingham), David Alan Basche (Todd Beamer), and Peter Hermann (Jeremy Glick) give performances worthy of their characters' names. The other actors, especially the air traffic controllers, give rousing performances, also. The story is told with realism, but the viewer gets a sense of compassion as well.<br /><br />I highly recommend this heroic story about forty people who sat down as strangers, but stood up as one.  This movie honors the memory of the fallen with dignity and grace, and their story of heroism in the face of certain death should serve as a message to everyone.  Watch this fine movie and see how forty ordinary people banded together as one.</p></body></html>

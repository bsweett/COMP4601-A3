<meta name="summary" content="This is undoubtedly one of the best "revenge films""></head><body><p>This is undoubtedly one of the best "revenge films" even though the revenger insists that he is not seeking revenge; he only wants society to learn to abide by the law.<br /><br />  The revenge plot - the result of ten years of meticulous planning - is excellent, the acting is superb, and so too are all of the gimmicks. There is not an unsuspenseful and undramatic moment. Two men push their way into the home of a brilliant government employee (Gerard Butler) in Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love, and one of them repeatedly stabs his wife and kills his child. The prosecutor (Jamie Foxx) insists that he must make a deal with the killer because he is afraid that he might otherwise loose his case. The killer agreed to testify against his accomplice if he only has to serve five years in jail. Butler demands that Foxx not do this especially because the man who will serve the relatively small jail sentence is the actual killer. Foxx refuses. Ten years later the accomplices is executed, but not as all expected. Butler changed the ingredients used to execute the man and he died a very violent and painful death. And this was only the first of Butler's many revenge murders. He captures the actual killer who invaded his home and violently kills him over a long period of time with painful injections of chemicals and by cutting up his body into twenty-five pieces while he was conscious.<br /><br /> Foxx finds learns from a man who worked with Butler that Butler is a brilliant man who the government used to kill people from a distance so that no one could prove who did the murder. He has the skill to anticipate how people will act, and he used that skill in developing the methods of murder. He never did anything he did not think out before hand. Thus, the chances of Foxx defeating him were very slim.<br /><br /> Butler allows himself to be arrested. He kills his cell mate and is placed in solitary confinement. "He is in jail because he wants to be in jail. Don't think that he killed his cell mate for no reason," the man who worked with Butler warns Foxx. "You can't stop him unless you put a bullet in his head." While in solitary confinement, he murders many more people. He kills the lawyer who represented the man who murdered his family and he kills the judge. Then he blows up the cars of the lawyers and staff who worked at the District Attorney's Office, except for Foxx and his boss, the DA. Then he kills the DA and the police who are guarding him. "Everyone," Butler tells Foxx, "must be accountable for their actions. I'm going to bring the whole f...g system down. It's going to be biblical." Foxx and others wonder if he has an accomplice. The mayor closes down Philadelphia to protect its inhabitants and has armed guards placed on the streets.<br /><br /> Viewers will sit in suspense watching all of this and how it is done. They will wonder if Foxx can find out if there is an accomplice and, if not, how does Butler commit the murders from solitary confinement, and can Foxx stop him, and will Foxx learn what Butler wants to teach him, and will Foxx resort to non-legal methods to stop him.</p></body></html>

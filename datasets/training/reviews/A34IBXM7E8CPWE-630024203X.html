I've done that on a few occasions with flicks like "Hard to Kill", "Silent Rage", "Tango and Cash" etc. So when I sat down to watch "First Blood" again after not seeing the film in about a decade I was expecting the worst. I was actually pleasantly surprised. "First Blood" still holds up as a great action flick. Stallone gives a solid performance with his first go as John Rambo, none of the action-flick cliches or hammy acting that ruined  his later movies like "Cobra" are present. One thing I got out of my most recent viewing that I never noticed before was the sympathy you begin to feel for Sheriff Will Teasle. Instead of just a run-of-the-mill bad guy, Sheriff Teasle finds himself in a situation where he is in over his head, and at a complete loss as to how to handle it. Initially he is just trying to protect his small town from what he considers a bad element, things get out of his control quickly, and he is stuck trying to mop things up. Rediscover this movie, like "Rocky", "First Blood" is one of Stallone's movies that you can enjoy as much today as you did during the Reagan administration.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good, but Best Picture?"></head><body><p>This was a good, heart-wrenching movie with a cliched ending, and good music score.  But best picture?  Wow.  Must have been a bad crop this year.  I enjoyed the film, its depiction of Jamal and his brother growing up as slum dogs, but there was something contrived about it as well.  Still, it was above average and kept me interested.</p></body></html>

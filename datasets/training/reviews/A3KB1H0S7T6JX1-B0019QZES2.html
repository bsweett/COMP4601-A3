<meta name="summary" content="Could have been so much better!"></head><body><p>Meet the Fockers, was a bit of a disappointment considering how wonderful Meet the Parents had been.  The film picks up from the cliffhanger that the first movie had left behind; meeting the in-laws.<br /><br />Ben Stiller, Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand, and the rest of the cast, do a very good job considering that the plot and most importantly the dialogues are not that great.<br /><br />There are quite a few unnecessary flaws with the movie, such as the extreme "weirdness" of the Fockers, which does not make them likable or cute in the least, and the little baby, which was totally unnecessary, not to mention the plot jumping around all over the place.<br /><br />In short, far from being a masterpiece, it is a movie worth watching, though you might not want to go so far as to purchase it.  3? Stars</p></body></html>

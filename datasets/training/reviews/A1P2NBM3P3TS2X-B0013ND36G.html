<meta name="summary" content="Good movie, but DVD extras disappoint"></head><body><p>Few directors are qualified to take up the reins of Cameron's classic Terminator film mythology.  T3 director Mostow does a very impressive and capable job, however, and keeps the story plugging along at a fairly tight clip.  With a running time of just under 105 minutes, the movie is trimmed of any fat or scenes of forced sentimentality (like the ones that slowed down T2 a bit).  <p>The chase scene in the first act, in which the TX chases our heroes in a 160-ton crane truck, is such a masterful blend of live-action and CGI that it defies criticism on any level.  The directory commentary on the DVD reveals that the sequence was originally intended to be shot at night, but the filming schedule necessitated a Summertime shoot, and the nights were just too short for the number of shooting days that would have been needed.  <p>Edward Furlong has been replaced by Nick Stahl for this movie.  Thank goodness!  Stahl is a MUCH, MUCH better actor - Furlong just grew tiresome by the end of T2.<p>Best part about this film:  the story thread continues to its only logical conclusion, if not the necessarily upbeat one.  I for one would have felt cheated if the film had ended any other way.  T3's storyline stays true to the apocalyptic vision set up by the first two films.  AND, it leaves open the opportunity for a 4th film.  Yes, the story could support another installment.  Whether Arnold, Cameron, Mostow, Gale Anne Hurd, or other franchise principals would get on board for #4 remains to be seen.  But I'd love to know where the story goes from here.<p>As for the DVD:  the majority of the Disc 2 extras look as if they were culled from an Electronic Press Kit.  Where is Van Ling (mastermind behind the special edition DVD extras in &quot;The Abyss&quot; and &quot;T2&quot;) when we need him?<p>The &quot;create your own effects sequence&quot; extra is majorly lame.  Majorly. <p>In short, you should buy this DVD to enjoy the movie but not get too excited about the anemic extras.  And there were DEFINITELY not enough extras to merit the second disc.  Fortunately the inclusion of a second disc didn't seem to affect the movie's retail price.<p>I enjoyed this film in the theatres last summer, but I enjoyed it even more on DVD when I viewed it with a less-critical pair of eyes.  12 years was a long time to wait for another &quot;Terminator&quot; film, so starting with my second viewing of this film I could evaluate it more on its own terms and not in comparison to &quot;T2&quot;.</p></body></html>

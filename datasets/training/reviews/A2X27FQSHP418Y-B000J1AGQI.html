<meta name="summary" content="Wallace made his best, but...."></head><body><p>I read the book before seeing the movie. IT was not a dissapointment, no, it's a good movie, but something's weird here...<p>In the book, Moore traces a brief background about the Vietnam situation (French dominance, American involvment, the politics of it all). In the movie, it is seldom mentioned. Also, half the book is about another battle fought two days later, at Landing Zone Albany, where American soldiers suffered even bigger losses than in Landing zone X-Ray.<p>Also, I'm positive that, in the book, Moore does not talk about himself killing anyone. The movie shows him killing a lot of vitnamese soldiers, some of them at point blank range... I understand that, since, the second battler would be completely wiped out for the movie, Wallace had to make Moore (Gibson) more dominant on the screen.<p>Just a note: what's wrong with Madeleine Stowe's mouth here? Have someone noticed that? There's something werong with her lips!</p></body></html>

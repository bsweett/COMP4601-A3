The Fog is one of my favorite horror films, and it's great to see it get the full DVD treatment!<p>  The plot is simple: On her 100th anniversary, the small hamlet of Antonio Bay is beseiged by a strange fog, cloaking the vengeful ghosts of a murdered leper colony, whose deaths provided the wealth necessary to start the town. Writer/Director John Carpenter gets right to the point, and there isn't a wasted frame of film in this tightly paced chiller. The scene where the men on the fishing boat see the ghost-ship is one of the classic movie creep-outs, and the ending is great. This film  really harks back to the old ghost story films of the 40's.<p>  The DVD is full-frame on one side, and the widescreen side of the disc has all of the extras, including commentary by Carpenter and co-writer/producer Debra Hill, an old documentary and a made-for-the-DVD documentary, trailers and commercials, posters and print ads, and lots more. (I would have liked to have seen more about the makeup effects for Blake and his crew, but that's just me...) The film transfer is GREAT- The Fog has never looked better, and the colors are lovely and vibrant. I even managed to find an easter egg! On the &quot;Special features&quot; screen, tab up until a pair of glowing eyes appear in the fog- press enter and you'll see a brief (a little under three minutes) music video of behind-the-scenes-footage from the making of the film.<p>  Overall, The Fog is a must-have for fans of Ghost stories or John Carpenter. Now lets see Escape From New York and Prince of Darkness get the deluxe treatment.....</p></body></html>

DeNiro, who directed the movie, shows, for the most part, restraint in his CIA epic.  There are some preachy moments where DeNiro seems to be making some comment on current events, and even a few Oliver Stone like whoppers, cloaked in the movie's muted tone.  Whatever.  But at one point there is the inevitable Be-Careful-You-Don't-Lose-Your-Soul line.  The problem is that the movie, by the time that line is delivered, has established in the viewer's mind that what is being watched is pretty much soulless exercise in filmmaking.  As much as it wants to be, the film never seems to develop into an Epic.  The Length is there, the meticulous craftsmanship in the framing of scenes (why I'm giving this 3 stars), but when it comes to getting a real historical sweep, things get hazy.  Oh, there's the Bay of Pigs, and old Nazi clips, but historical hooks are surprisingly few.  The lead casting is also very questionable.  Damon as the robotic and detached "company" man, Edward Wilson, and the exotic Jolie as the wife and mother, Clover - Margaret, is bizarre.  Actually, both actors do very well, it's just that physically they seem to be wrong fits for the roles.  Further, neither actor seems to ever age in a movie that spans decades.  The model here, was obviously the "Godfather II."  Unfortunately, the Good Shepherd lack both the scale and the story of what is one of the greatest American films.  And that should have been expected.<br /><br />The movie does have several "good" moments however.  The Skull & Crossbones stuff, seemed pretty authentic, even if you've read about it a dozen times in fiction and nonfiction.  And the plane ride murder is chilling, as is the brutal interrogation of a defector.  But three hours worth?  No. Try the "Quiet American," it's shorter, and much better film that deals with the world of shadows.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="&quot;Oh, We Wouldn't be Caught Dead in Chicago!&quot;"></head><body><p>Why's that? Well, because musicians Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon just happened to witness the St. Valentine's Day Massacre and have to skidaddle off to Florida disguised as the newest members of an all-girl band, Josephine and Daphne.  Even with all the stress that would cause, the guys (or girls?) manage to find love complications, as Tony develops an interest in band singer Marilyn Monroe, and Jack (in his Daphne disguise) finds himself hotly pursued by millionaire Joe E. Brown. And if that isn't enough, it just so happens that the Florida resort hotel the band's playing at has been chosen for the gangster convention, so the very mobsters Tony and Jack are fleeing wind up right in the elevator with them. Plenty of comic situations abound.<p>In addition to Curtis, Lemmon, Monroe,and Brown, the cast also features George Raft as the mobster who ordered the Chicago hit, and Pat O'Brien as the cop tracking Raft down to Florida. All are good in their respective roles. While &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; was recognized as the top comedy of the century by the AFI, I really wouldn't consider it the FUNNIEST picture I've ever seen. Don't get me wrong; it's quite hilarious, but Numero Uno? There would be a lot of competition for that slot in my opinion. Just to name a few, in no particular order: &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;, &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on My Way to the Forum&quot;, &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot;, &quot;Moonstruck&quot; are all ones to make me laugh hysterically. <p>Be that as it may, &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot; is probably the best work of the three main stars, and for that alone, it's worth a peek if you haven't caught it yet.</p></body></html>

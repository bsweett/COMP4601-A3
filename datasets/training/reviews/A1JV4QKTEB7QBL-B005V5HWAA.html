<meta name="summary" content="Mr. Brooks Kills Me!"></head><body><p>Two hours of non-stop anxiety . . . that pretty much sums up Bruce Evan's psychological jaunt, "Mr. Brooks" starring Kevin Costner in the title role.  Earl Brooks has just been named businessman of the year.  The owner of a carton manufacturing firm, he lives quite the life; married to the more than attractive Marg Helgenberger with a fine Portland, Oregon home, and a cutsey-tootsey college aged daughter who wants nothing but to quit school and get down to business, following in her father's illustrious footsteps.  Calm and collected as only Kevin Costner can play it, Earl seems a portrait of the all American dream incarnate.<br /><br />Except for one thing--he blows off steam in a profoundly interesting way.  Reminiscent of Brett Easton Ellis' American Psycho, Earl cruises about town accompanied by Marshall (the diabolically amusing William Hurt) the definitive backseat driver who acts not only as Earl's confidant but the ultimate pusher--egging Earl to treat himself to a little well-deserved R&R--in the form of a well-planned murder.  In fact, Earl has stymied the police for years--known as the Thumbprint Killer, he remains virtually undetectable.<br /><br />Cleverly Marshall acts ala Howard and Glazer's "A Beautiful Mind," as Earl's other persona--existing only in Earl's mind but entirely visible to the audience.  Together Hurt and Costner gleefully feed off each other in a titillating pas-de-deux that illuminates the dark side of the typical Costner role.  Usually taciturn and noble, this Costner plans his murders with a fiendish abandon while Hurt plays the goading devil's advocate.  As the brains and catalyst, Hurt often enables with the frenetic energy of a naughty child; Costner brilliantly plays his part with more stoicism, but frequently and delightfully cannot contain himself.  His bursts of maniac laughter are well worth the price of admission.<br /><br />Alas, all good fun must come to an end when the criminal duo commits a faux pas that has the potential to bring them down.  Voyeur photographer Mr. Smith (comedian Dane Cook) captures Earl on film at the scene of the crime.  He desires a small recompense for keeping his mouth shut--Earl's watcher fancies himself as a serial killer wannabe.  His price for silence?--being able to participate in the next murder and learn from Earl's years of grisly experience.<br /><br />In addition to this, Mr. Brooks must attend to a little problem on the home front. Imagine the tumultuous conversation between Earl and Marshal when Earl sniffs blood on Daughter Dearest's hands and comes to the rather 21st century conclusion that he has passed on his murder addiction to her genetically.<br /><br />What a hoot!  An extremely tired looking Demi Moore ups the fascination ante as the police officer that swears to apprehend the Thumbprint Killer.  Burdened by a wayward husband and side issues of her own, her character, albeit it as ludicrous as the rest maintains this wild ride's momentum to the very end.<br /><br />Most satisfactory however remains Kevin Costner.  An actor that I have never liked, he excels in this role, shining like a multi-faceted jewel, he shifts from stodgy and austere, distraught and distracted to frenetic and abstracted.  Brilliant!  Bravo, Mr. Costner.<br /><br />Okay, the film may suffer from a little too many plot twists and turns.  But rather than make this film less enjoyable, this overkill technique serves to render "Mr. Brooks" with a graphic novel-esque feel not unlike `A History of Violence', especially with Hurt again hamming it up in a campy cameo type performance that is hard to beat.  In the same comic book sense, the idea that murder can be a byproduct of success like alcoholism or white collar drug addiction and curbed by regular meetings at the local AA hammers my funny bone to the point where I cannot stop giggling and letting out an occasional howl that sounds much too similar to the vulgar laughter Hurt and Costner share while in Marshal and Earl personae.<br /><br />Bottom line?  `Mr. Brooks' sparkles with a Sweeney Todd type humor that toys with the graphic novel technique employed in "A History of Violence."  Costner surprises the audience with a nuanced performance well worth looking at more than once.  Hurt cannot disappoint; he cannot be more superb.  Not for everyone, especially with its themes of serial killings and violence, I, nonetheless recommend "Mr. Brooks" wholeheartedly and unabashedly.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />"reneofc"</p></body></html>

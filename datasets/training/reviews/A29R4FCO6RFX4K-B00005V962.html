<meta name="summary" content="Ocean's 11"></head><body><p>Steven Soderbergh's classy Vegas heist movie OCEAN'S 11 is one of the most purely entertaining films ever made, with a fantastic cast including George Clooney, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts. One of the few Hollywood remakes that surpasses the original, this has so much style, panache and wit that it elevates it above the Frank Sanatra caper. Following the excellent ERIN BROCKOVICH and TRAFFIC, Soderbergh has proved again that he is one of the hottest new directors out there. The superb ensamble of supporting cast are all perfect in their offbeat roles, especially Scott Caan, Carl Reiner and Elliott Gould (From TV's Friends). Ted Griffin's top-notch screenplay combined with the A-list cast, this one is a bonifide winner.<br />The DVD extra features include a halarious commentary with Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Andy Garcia, and an insightful commentary with director Soderbergh and Griffin. &quot;The making of Ocean's 11&quot; is a suitably stylish doco with interviews from the cast and crew and trailers. 5-star entertainment.</p></body></html>

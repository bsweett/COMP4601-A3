Not that I don't think he's a great actor or his performance sucked, he was good playing the role with the right amount of camp, but it's a cartoonish character, and it's got no depth like say his other less "successful" roles in Ed Wood and What's Eating Gilbert Grape, and Don Juan Dimarco. It's less interesting to see him play the same part, because it's just a bit repetitious. I must say that his performance still outshone Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom. Amongst other supporting players, I was quite impressed with Bill Nighy(the "tako sunomono" villian), and the near-unrecognizable Stellar Skarsgard. Oh, and there is the scene-stealing Naomi Harris who was wickedly memorable. The fight scenes were better this time around and lots more special effects. They even let different ethnic actors play the creatures. I noticed the "Headless Sea Creature" spoke Cantonese in one brief scene. They do look very real and creepy, can't imagined the amount of prep work put in by the SPFX and Prosthetics department. The Production is quite lavish and impressive. Got to love the breakdown and continuity of the wardrobe department, even thought there is only a few changes for the cast. Wonder how many shirts they used for Bloom? The audiences is obviously divided into two sides; one will laugh at the physical and verbal jokes easily, and the other thinks they are not funny at all. I am more of the latter. Oh, do watch for a cameo appearance by Geoffrey Rush. I think he's going to make a comeback in Pirates 3, and I am certainly looking forward to seeing Chow Yun Fat's participation!</p></body></html>

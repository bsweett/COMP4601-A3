<meta name="summary" content="A solid spy thriller."></head><body><p>Matt Damon stars as Jason Bourne, a man who's found afloat in the sea with several bullets in his back. He's salvaged by a fishing boat and awakens to discover he has no memory of his previous life. After he recuperates, he heads to shore to find his true identity. With the assistance of a pretty German woman (Franka Potente), Bourne goes on the run with covert assassins trying to kill him and top government agents trying to cover their tracks.<p>The Bourne Identity is an interesting summer thriller. It's certainly not an all-out action blockbuster, as the previews might lead you to believe, but there are some terrific action sequences. What truly makes the film work is Damon himself, whose first bid as an action star is completely convincing and engaging. The movie nicely keeps us in the dark about his past, we know just as much as he does and eagerly anticipate every discovery he makes. <p>From a certain point-of-view, Franka Potente isn't useful except as a love interest, and on that level, her presence works. Not only is she a fine actress, but she and Damon share a palpable chemistry. Hopefully, she'll return in the sequel, and this series won't go the Bond/M:I route with a new love interest in every installment. Take note, Hollywood, steadiness and consistent relationships are always appreciated.<p>The Bourne Identity's premise is similar to The Long Kiss Goodnight's, but unlike that movie, takes its story seriously and aspires to work as both a thriller and a character-oriented drama, which it does. Once Bourne's past is revealed (not that it isn't that hard to figure out), the film loses a bit of momentum, but does wrap things up believably and in a suprisingly somewhat quiet fashion (compared to say, Bond, Triple X, or M:I).<p>For action fans, there's enough here to keep them satisfied, with the standout setpieces being an excellent martial arts fight set in an eerily empty apartment and an exhilarating car chase through the streets of Paris. I've seen at least two other films with auto chases set in Paris (Ronin, The Transporter) and this one's my favorite, even though it's also the shortest and features the least attractive car (a mini as compared to an Audi in Ronin and a BMW in The Transporter).<p>There are a few disappointments here and there, particularly Bourne's showdown with The Professor (Clive Owen), which concludes rather abruptly considering the huge build-up. Julia Stiles is also in the film, and her presence is rather distracting (I can't look at her without thinking, &quot;Hey, it's Julia Stiles!&quot;) in a role that could have been played by just about anyone. But in the end, The Bourne Identity succeeds because it rarely goes over-the-top (no megalomaniacal billionaires here), maintains an even tone, and establishes likeable characters and good storytelling.</p></body></html>

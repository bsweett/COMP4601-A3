<meta name="summary" content="Great if you want adrenalin-packed chase scenes"></head><body><p>The plot of "Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines" is no different from that of T2:  two cyborgs, one programmed to kill eventual savior John Connor and the other to protect him, are zapped through time.  This conflict, a classic chase scene set-up, comprises the entire movie.  Without the questions of ethics and the unpredictability of the future uses of technology explored in T2, T3 is all action and no substance.  This will delight many fans and disappoint others.<p>Nick Stahl as John Connor is an unlikely hero: nihilistic, hollow-eyed, and physically unimposing.  Claire Danes is exceptional in her role as the reluctant but fierce Kate who maintains her class even as she watches Schwarzenegger spit out a bullet.  Schwarzenegger plays his cyborg as he always has, with the same deadpan delivery whether he is expressing a horrific truth or poking fun at the previous films in the series.  I know a lot of people object to Kristianna Loken as the new T-X model, but I loved her.  She exhibits both the cold ambition of a machine and the tastes of a predator.<p>The action sequences are all high-gear, breathtaking excitement even if the logic of them isn't always clear.  The screenwriters have provided some hilarious moments to punctuate the tension, many of which refer to jokes established in T1 and T2.  The ending is both surprising and surprisingly original, the only solid plot in the movie.<p>If you are a Terminator fan, you must see this film.  Chase scene devotees and those with a hunger for pure action will love it.  The two hours pass quickly when you're gripping the arms of your chair, but don't expect to take anything away from this movie.  If you want even a modicum of substance with your action, skip this.  Four stars for the action, two for the plot.</p></body></html>

I enjoyed the movie, but I found most of it instantly forgettable, and I could barely follow what little plot there was, thinking that Hellboy ATE cats, instead of just being partial to them. And why didn't Liz want to come back to where everyone else was? And the Spear Of Destiny, most recently seen in Constantine, and subject of a lot of discussion as to whether it did kill Christ or not, appears, although briefly.<br /><br />However, I did love Ron Perlman - who shares the same birthday as me. I hadn't previously heard of him, but his dry sarcasm puts him in the same league as Bill Murray in my opinion. He was definitely cute as Hellboy, and the sarcasm was spot on. However, having seen him a photo of him without the Hellboy makeup on (which took four hours to apply), OMG, is it the same guy?! To prepare for his role, Ron read all the Hellboy comics and worked out three hours a day, five to seven days a week (varies). He also worked out while shooting, every day he had off from filming, he would workout. He also broke a rib while filming, after jumping onto a train that was coming towards him at about 45 mph. Very early on in the film's preproduction, the filmmakers considered putting Hellboy's giant stone hand on his left arm rather than the right, so as to grant the actor playing Hellboy the full use of his right hand. Ron Perlman turned out to be left-handed, so the filmmakers were able to preserve the Right Hand of Doom.<br /><br />There are no opening credits save the 3-D title, which is flown over several times by the camera before it pulls back to reveal the full title. During the closing credits there's a brief shot of Dr. Manning still trying to contact someone on his team and getting nothing in response. A shadow of a Sammael passes in the background as the scene fades back to credits.<br /><br />Both Mike Mignola and Guillermo del Toro have cameos in this. Mike, Hellboy's creator appears dressed as a knight in a crowd of costumed people menaced by Sammael. Guillermo is dressed as dragon in a crowd of costumed people menaced by Sammael.<br /><br />Extras are your usual for these movies. They include: commentary by director Guillermo del Toro and "Hellboy"-Creator Mike Mignola; commentary by Ron Perlman, Selma Blair, Rupert Evans and Jeffrey Tambor; all-new DVD comics: eight branching DVD comics by Mike Mignola; "Hellboy: The Seeds of Creation" - a 2.5-hour documentary on the making of the film; "Right Hand of Doom: Set Visits" - behind-the-scenes branching feature; "From the Den" Hellboy recommends... Geraldn McBoing Boing animated shorts; feature-length storyboard track; video introduction by Selma Blair; four computer-generated animated scene breakdowns; five Board-a-Matics: side-by-side comparison of scenes with the animated storyboards; animatics; three deleted scenes with optional commentary by Guillermo del Toro; character bios written by the director; maquette 3-D character sculptures video gallery and poster explorations.<br /><br />I hope the sequel's better than the original, but more in storyline, and making Liz seem a little bit tougher more than anything else. The special effects are brilliant, my favourite is Liz's effects. Definitely worth watching though!<br /><br />If you're a sucker for finding easter eggs (not the chocolate ones), on Disc 2 go to the Board A Matics Screen. Put cursor on back, then press down. You will see what look like 3 drops appear. Press Enter to see a Wireframe animation of the Apocalypse scene.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="&quot;Consider That a Divorce&quot;"></head><body><p>Total Recall is a milestone in Scince Fiction Cinema that helped boost the careers of actor Arnold Scwarzenegger, actress Sharon Stone, as well as director Paul Verhoeven, who first got our attention with his other Sci-Fi Masterpiece; Robocop.<p>Certainly purists will pick the film apart, but as Leanord Nimoy once said in Star Trek II, &quot;It is easier to destroy than to create&quot;.  Total Recall works on two levels: a dream or a reality, but whichever way you choose to watch the movie, both levels make sense to you.  That in itself is an accomplishment.  Most sci-fi's these days can't even work on one level, let alone two.  <p>If you've been holding out for a Special Edition of Total Recall, you can finally cash in your chips because it has finally arrived, in a circular metal tin, shaped to look like Mars no less.  I'm sure that some people will have mixed feelings on the special features (the &quot;Recall's Virtual Vacations&quot; are nothing really special) only because other releases like the T2 Special Edition have made us more picky as far as a good S.E. and a bad one.  Total Recall extras are in no way bad.  The 30 minute &quot;Imagining Total Recall&quot; documentary is well made and delivers a lot of insight.  It's also a retrospective documentary, with both Arnold and Mr. Verhoeven looking back at the film 10 years after the fact.  This is of course defined more closely in the audio commentary by both the star and the director.  If you bought the Collector's Edition of Conan The Barbarian and enjoyed Arnold's audio commentary for that movie, you'll most assuredly enjoy this one..although there was no mention of the two working together on a sequel which has been talked about for years.<p>The disappointment from many is that Total Recall, at one time, had a longer cut which made it even more excessively violent.  From fear of receiving and X-rating, the film was cut down to the version we all know and love.  Why hasn't Paul Verhoeven added those scenes back in now or at least given us a deleted scenes section?  Considering that Robocop and Basic Instinct (his two other successful movies) have already gotten the &quot;Director's Cut&quot; treatment, it is indeed a wonder why Total Recall was forgotten in that aspect.  Not that I'm complaining, but considering that the T2 Special Edition gave us three different versions of that movie to watch, would it have been so bad to do the same here?  <p>As far as the picture and sound is concerned I don't have any real complaints whatsoever.  The picture is crisp, clean and clear and the sound plays great on my sound system.  Perhaps one day a two disc set of Total Recall will be released.  Yeah, and maybe one day Paul Verhoeven will release a Special Unrated Edition of &quot;Showgirls&quot;, complete with commentary. Until then.<p>&quot;Get your ass to Mars&quot; - Arnold Schwarzenegger as Hauser</p></body></html>

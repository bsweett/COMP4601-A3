<meta name="summary" content="I wanted this to be super..."></head><body><p>I remember when `Super 8' was about to drop.  Everyone that I knew was in a state of frenzy.  It just looked so wonderful.  The nostalgia of seeing a science fiction film in the same vein as those pioneered by Steven Spielberg was almost too good to be true.  Could `Super 8' really be this generation's `E.T.'?  The world was on edge and nearly every Oscar prognosticator was prematurely claiming it a lock in nearly every tech category, and some were even claiming that it was on its way to Best Picture and possibly even Best Director glory.<br /><br />Then it opened to lukewarm critical response, fizzled out and walked away with ZERO Oscar nominations.<br /><br />I was one of those who rushed to predict this everywhere, and I was wholly thrilled to see the film.  It just looked so lovely.  The biggest issue with a film like `Super 8' is that it is rather silly.  The bugs were not worked out wholly.  The script, while rich with contagious dialog (the sparring between the child actors is the finest part of the film) is too unsure of itself to aid the film any.  When we are focused on the alien, the film falls apart; and that is a sad fact considering that the whole draw here was, in all respects, the alien.<br /><br />So here's the basic premise.  In Ohio, way back in 1979, there was a young boy named Joe.  Joe's mother has died and he's obviously distraught about it.  His father love him, but he's preoccupied with work (he's the Sheriff's Deputy) and he's a little too hard edged.  Joe's best friend Charles is obsessed with making movies and convinces the neighborhood kids to make a zombie film with him.  While making the film, a train crashes and a `thing' escapes and havoc is set loose on the small town as dogs and eventually people start disappearing.  The military is all over it, the citizens are in a panic and Joe and his friends start searching for the answers.<br /><br />Visually, the film works to a certain extent.  The special effects can feel a little overdone in parts (the crash itself lasts far too long and screams "look at me") and the alien itself is an uninspired disappointment.  That said, the set pieces are beautifully done and the whole feel of the era portrayed is nicely kept in tone.  The atmosphere of the film's first half is flawless.  In fact, leading up to the actual alien business, I was thinking this film was truly brilliant.  Sadly, it takes a nosedive into clich&eacute; ridden sci-fi with little inspiration to keep it afloat.  The child performances are all great; Elle Fanning proving once again that she deserves an Oscar, but the adults are all simple creations that lack depth.  The token villain (the military Col. Nelec) is a walking stereotype, and Noah Emmerich is a terrible actor.  I hated the ending, for it felt lazy and rushed and so not worthy of the tremendous build up.  In fact, I really wish that the whole alien thing had been scrapped from this movie completely.  It just didn't work.<br /><br />Why couldn't J.J. Abrams have attempted to make this generation's `Stand By Me' instead?<br /><br />Alas, I'm giving this a B-.  It was surely entertaining, despite its failure to live up to my high expectations.  The acting was very nice and the tone of the film was beautifully rendered.  This is a very good movie; but it could have been great.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not What Star Trek Fans Were Expecting In 1979"></head><body><p>10 years following the cancellation of Gene Roddenberry's sci-fi television series, &quot;Star Trek&quot;, fans of the show (that aired for only 3 years between 1966 and 1969) were elated to learn that the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; cast had been reunited for a 2-hour feature film.  The much anticipated film, entitled &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, was placed under the direction of probably one of the best directors of all time, Robert Wise, who had previously won two Oscars for Best Director for the films &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1961) and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1965).  He also edited the 1941 film &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; and directed &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; (1951) and &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; (1971).  However, even with such an impressive director at the helm, long-time &quot;Star Trek&quot; fans, as well as the rest of the audience, were not particularly impressed with the film.  Why?  The primary cause was poor writing, but Robert Wise may not have been the best choice for director either.  And what of the writers?  Though not credited, Gene Roddenberry was involved with writing the story, but the film's story was credited to Alan Dean Foster, who started writing sci-fi novels in 1972, but had no previous film or television writing experience.  Other writing credits go to Harold Livingston, whose previous writing experience was primarily for television shows, but he had never written anything for the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series.  Additional non-credited writing was done by William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy.<p>The story itself begins as follows: a massively large cloud emerges from unknown regions of space and is first detected by the Federation when it passes through Klingon space and is attacked by three Klingon warships.  The Klingons are destroyed, and the cloud is found to be heading directly for Earth.  Conveniently, with no other starships available to intercept the massive cloud, only the U.S.S. Enterprise, which is nearing the completion of its redesign, is in range to intercept the cloud.  The now Admiral James T. Kirk (William Shatner) easily convinces Star Fleet Command to give him command of the Enterprise, even though a new captain has already been assigned, Captain William Decker (Stephen Collins).  (Capt. Decker is the son of Commodore Matthew Decker, who died in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series episode, &quot;The Doomsday Machine&quot;, which aired on October 20, 1967.  In that episode, Commodore Decker was played by William Windom.)  Most of the original crew is already on board the Enterprise, including Commander Montgomery 'Scotty' Scott (James Doohan), Lt. Pavel Chekov (Walter Koenig), Lt. Commander Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), the now Dr. Christine Chapel (Majel Barrett, who married Gene Roddenberry) and the return of Janice Rand (Grace Lee Whitney), who was removed by producers during the first season of the original series.  Dr. Leonard 'Bones' McCoy (DeForest Kelley) is drafted back into Star Fleet at the behest of Kirk, but Spock (Leonard Nimoy) has been busy purging all emotions on Vulcan for several years.  A new alien crew member is introduced in the film, Lt. Ilia (Persis Khambatta, who got to shave her head for the role.)  From that point on, much of the film is essentially a rework of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series episode &quot;The Changeling&quot;, which aired originally on September 29, 1967.  The subplot between Capt. Decker and Lt. Ilia is very interesting and should have received greater attention.<p>The most memorable scenes in the film include the transporter accident, McCoy's arrival on the Enterprise, Spock on Vulcan, the Klingons' battle with the cloud, the arrival of Lt. Ilia, the worm hole, Spock's arrival, the Enterprise's first cloud encounter, the probe, Spock's space-suited journey, Kirk's challenges to V'Ger and the final bridge scene.  The two worst scenes in the film are both lengthy and have very little dialog: Kirk's lengthy external tour of the Enterprise and the psychedelic cloud light show reminiscent of the final scenes from &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968).  Acting in the film was certainly not stellar, and was often rather emotionless and uninspired.  The best acting came from Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, the Klingon Captain (Mark Lenard, who usually played Spock's father Sarek in other &quot;Star Trek&quot; projects) and James Doohan.  Other notable characters include Sonak (Jon Rashad Kamal) and the female Vulcan Master (Edna Glover).  One thing that this film forever changed was the appearance of the Klingons who have the now familiar ridged foreheads.  In the original television series, they appeared far more human.  Special effects used in the film may seem dated to some viewers, but were quite good for the time.<p>Overall, I rate &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot; with 3 out of 5 stars.  It certainly could have been much better, but it's not a complete waste of time.  Had more of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; television series writers been involved with this film, it probably would have been far more memorable and enjoyable.  At least the DVD version includes many deleted scenes.  These scenes help to explain the story and should probably have remained in the original film.</p></body></html>

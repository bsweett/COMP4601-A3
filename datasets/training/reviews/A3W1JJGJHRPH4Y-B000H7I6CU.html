<meta name="summary" content="Doc Hollywood Rehashed"></head><body><p>I have never been into Cars. I am not into NASCAR and I drive Fords older than the audience this movie is intended for. The movie is beautifully done. The digitized west look good, not as good as the real thing, but very good. The plot of this movie is basically "Sullivan Travels" or more exactly "Doc Hollywood." There is a little "An officer and a Gentlemen" thrown in, but the plot is basically a highly successful city dweller gets stuck in the country, learns simplicity is sometimes better, develops sympathy and mercy for his fellow man, and finds love. Since I did not have the "Car" tie in, I found this movie rather boring. I rather watch "Doc Hollywood" again. Another thing that put me off was that though the cars vaguely resemble the actors who did their voices, I found the cars rather hard to sympathesize with. I found the faces emotionless. I wasn't rooting for the characters very much, except perhaps the tow truck.</p></body></html>

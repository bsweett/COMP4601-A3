<meta name="summary" content="The End to Tarantino's Spaghetti Kung-Fu Western"></head><body><p>In a telling moment of "Kill Bill Volume 2" Bill's brother, Budd, played in a wonderful understated performance by Michael Madsen, is listening to a recounting of events we saw in Volume 1 - specifically when Uma Thuman's Bride single-handedly destroy Lucy Liu's O-Ren Shii and her bodyguard platoon, the "Crazy 88".<br /><br />Budd asks "You're telling me she cut through eighty-eight bodyguards before she got to O-Ren?"<br /><br />Brother Bill replies "Nah, there weren't really eighty-eight of them. They just called themselves "The Crazy 88."<br /><br />Budd asks "How come?"<br /><br />Bill answers "I don't know. I guess they thought it sounded cool."<br /><br />There is a LOT in Quentin Tarantino movies that happens because it looks or sounds cool.  I'm reminded in "Pulp Fiction" of the dialogue-less scene in the Pawn shop where Bruce Willis is upstairs selecting a weapon to use on the psychotic murdering rapists downstairs.  He considers a few lethal clubs and even a chain-saw before settling on the Samurai sword and in the audience I was thinking "YEAH! Get the samurai sword! That'll get 'em!" Plus - it's cool.<br /><br />There is a scene where one of the characters sicks a deadly Black Mamba on another character, then whips out a notebook with pages of hand-written notes about how god-awful deadly the Black Mamba is. The character sits down, flips open the notebook, and delivers an almost pharmacologic description of the lethal venom, along with "'In the bush,' the saying goes, 'a lion can kill you, a leopard can kill you, and the black mamba can kill you. However, only with the mamba is death certain.' Hence its handle, 'Death Incarnate.'" Pretty cool, huh?"<br /><br />Tarantino's movies are cool, and the characters in them know it. The smallest touches are added, sometimes for no apparent reason other than to add a "cool" factor.  All of the members of Bill's Assassination team are called the "Deadly Viper Assassination Squad" and they all have "Snake" Code-names.  Why?  'Cuz it's cool, of course.<br /><br />In the beginning, at the wedding rehearsal of the bride, we get to see Samuel Jackson portraying the piano player for the wedding, and is there anyone cooler than Mr. Jackson in the movies?  He asserts his coolness by telling how he sat in with practically every R&B group that came through his little town over 2 decades.<br /><br />The Bride is standing at the alter of her wedding rehearsal when she hears a flute playing a familiar refrain.  She follows the notes outside where she finds her old boss and lover, Bill, playing the familiar notes on his old flute.  Bill is played by David Carradine, and if movies gave out "comeback of the year" awards like sports does, Mr. Carradine would have earned it in this role, courtesy of Mr. Tarantino.  For extra "coolness", the flute that Bill is playing for the Bride is the same one that Carradine played back 30 years ago in his iconic role as Caine in the wildly popular tv series "Kung Fu".<br /><br />The "Wedding Chapel Massacre" that we're told about in a roundabout way in Volume 1 is set up perfectly in Volume 2, then executed with a single swooping crane shot that backs from the wedding party at the altar, all the way back through the church, down the steps, straight back through the gravel parking lot where the other members of the Assassination Squad are approaching with cool strides and lethal weapons.  The crane swoops the camera up overhead and we see the flashes in the church and hear the shots and screams - and we KNOW what is happening in there without being shown in gory detail.  I can think of no single camera shot as virtuoso since Orson Welles' virtuoso opening to "Touch of Evil".<br /><br />I haven't told you ANYTHING about the plot, but if you watched Volume 1 you KNOW where the plot is going.  There's a surprise or two, but there's delight in every scene.  I've read Roger Ebert say that movies aren't as important in "what they're about" as in "how they're about it".<br /><br />Kill Bill is about Kung-Fu movies and westerns, and the way it's about it is..... cool.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Interesting and Unusual Movie."></head><body><p>I've never listened to "A Prairie Home Companion" radio program. Oh, I was aware of it, to be sure, and I've seen Garrison Keillor on TV shows. Our family lived in North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota and Iowa when we were younger and both my brother and sister have said that I just had to listen to this radio program. They listened primarily for the stories and said that these stories represented our kind of people. Well, I've heard him relate some pretty amusing stories on TV, but I never did get around to listening to his radio program. Alas, my regret. In any case, I was looking through the ultra-bargain DVD bins at a Ross store and found the "A Prairie Home Companion" DVD. I bought it and my wife and I viewed it last night. I might add that she was totally unaware of the radio show or the movie about it's supposed closing day.<br /><br />It's an interesting movie. It's fiction, and is a story of the last  Prairie Home Companion radio show before the venue where they broadcast it from is torn down. The show is done before a live audience and there's a lot of footage of preparation and behind-the-scenes activity. It's interesting. I had no idea a radio programs could be so complicated and involve so many characters. There's live music, really bad jokes, corny commercials and a host of other activities, including a back-stage death while the show is on the air. One thing I missed about the movie, and would have most liked to have seen, is Garrison Keillor telling some of his funny yarns. In any case, the movie was very worthwhile viewing but would probably be much more suited viewing for a Prairie Home Companion fan, rather than for someone who has never listened to the program.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></body></html>

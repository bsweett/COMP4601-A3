His second feature,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000PAAJZ6">Boogie Nights</a>, was built around an ensemble cast.  He taught himself from the likes of Robert Altman (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/6305918880">Nashville</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000305ZXO">Short Cuts - Criterion Collection</a>), and in some ways passed the great director.<br /><br />Magnolia is the story of nine interlocking characters, whose, in one day in LA, lives change.<br /><br />This is a wonderful movie.  One of the best of the year, in a very good year by the way.<br /><br />This two disc set includes deleted scenes, featurettes, Aimee Mann's video, and a number of other things.<br /><br />Must Have.</p></body></html>

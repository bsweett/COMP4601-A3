<meta name="summary" content="An Interesting Concept And A Brilliant Movie By Pixar"></head><body><p>Cars was the 7th feature film created by Pixar studios and it kept up the trend of excellent Pixar productions. Managing to win Pixar its 3rd consecutive best Animated Feature Academy award, there was no denying how good this film was. The story is clich&eacute; but the concept is still as fresh as Toy Story was back in the day. Its colourful and detailed environments, cars and sequences are put together brilliantly. Pixar makes its movies with this confidence in their own abilities. They seem to never doubt their animation skills or their general imagination for a unique and awe inspiring story.<br /><br />I mentioned that the story is clich&eacute; so I guess I should explain what I mean when I say that. Most Disney movies tend to be along the same lines with a main character who tends to be quite narrow minded and through a series of enlightening events manages to become open minded and a nice person. There's nothing wrong with that, after all it's good to teach our kids that we should all be open minded and nice people. If that's portrayed by a jealous toy or an overprotective fish then so be it. With that clich&eacute; plot device, Pixar still manages to create a unique film and a brilliantly funny in between to give us a hell of a lot of enjoyment.<br /><br />Cars focuses around stock car race car Lightning McQueen who's a racing champion and a sure fire shot at winning the prestigious Piston Cup. During the final race of the Piston Cup championship, a series of events lead to him and two other cars being tied in a photo finish. Because of this situation it is decided that the three will take part in a one off race to decide the true champion. Whilst being transported by Mack to California, McQueen rolls out the back of the truck while asleep and ends up lost in a small town known as Radiator Springs. McQueen accidentally damages the road in Radiator Springs and is forced by the towns Judge, Doc to stay until he fixes the road. While McQueen is in town he makes friends with a truck named Mater, who isn't the brightest bulb in the street. He also seems to develop a crush on another car known as Sally who's a porsche 911 Carrera.<br /><br />I wont tell you more about the story as it will essentially ruin the movie for you. The whole movie is just amazing and although I was disappointed with their follow up of Ratatouille, Pixar really made me a dedicated fan with this. I would strongly recommend this to any fans of their past movies or just to fans of movies in general as it's just overly entertaining and quite loveable.</p></body></html>

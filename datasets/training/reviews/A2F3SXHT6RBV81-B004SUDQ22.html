I saw a local performance of the play written by David Auburn.  James Francis was good as the young seducer.  Instead of down-playing by the younger sister, the local actress overdid and her New York dominating sister didn't know how to dress.  So, I left at intermission.  This movie follows the dialogue of the play faithfully, which gets bogged down for a time and, I started to get up and lieave this time, also.<br /><br />What do I know about complicated math anyway -- it wa Greek to me, as I couldn't know a prime number from a zero.  Algebra was bad enough to get through for me in high school.  As they showed scenes around Chicago, I was glad I had stayed.  It brought back good memories of my week there.  The funeral service looked to be the same chapel on the University of Chicago campus where my son's wedding too place fifteen years ago.  Things there don't change much.<br /><br />The older sister hosted a 'gathering' of strangers after the funeral -- "people expect it" -- guess that's where I messed up in 1998 when my dad was buried.  No food was provided by anyone for any body.  Anthony Hopkins was his usual star-quality as the mad mathematician.  His math whiz daughter, Catherine, was served well by Gwyneth Paltrow (pre-Apple), and Jake Gyllenhaal (boy, is he on a roll, in so many films out now) was effective as Hal, who got a little drunk and played sex games with an inexperienced, backward social being.  Is Hal just using her?  Has he been befuddling hre all along, causing her to trust him enough to fall in love?  What a change -- the sexy, short black dress for the funeral (jeans jacket over it) and the bare midrift which didn't fit her character a bit, shows what a little affection can make a difference in a lonely woman's life!<br /><br />Though they'd been in Chicago a long time, they did not sound "Chicago."  Who runs naked down the Midway -- I missed that?  The old man wore a ring on his left hand, proper finger, but had no wife.  Strange.<br /><br />Catherine was thought to have inherited his tendency toward instability, but the drinking (in my opinion) is what caused her to lose "days" while sleeping it off.  He'd tried to stay in touch with his creativity and priorities and taking advantage of the times "inspiration" overtook his mind.  Catherine was always trying to cope and make things better for both of them.<br /><br />She had worked out a "proof" as an assignmetn for her "lost" father and showed it to Hal because she trusted him and it was her gift for bringing her to life again.  "You had a life."  Once I was told that I'd had an exciting life.  Well, I did several exciting things at intervals but, overall, we all end up alone and unloved.  Mr. Lewellyn is a distant relative, and has his excitement in numbers and striving to the impossible: peace of mind and happiness.</p></body></html>

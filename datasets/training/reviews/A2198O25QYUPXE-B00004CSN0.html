<meta name="summary" content="One of the best action films of the 1990s"></head><body><p>"Heat" is an action packed bank robbery film with a finely assembled cast.<br /><br />Al Pacino plays policeman Lieutenant Vincent Hanna and Robert De Niro is career larcenist Neil McCauley, which is the first time these two Hollywood greats have appeared in the same film since "The Godfather II". Val Kilmer complements the mix as clever crime partner Chris Shiherlis.<br /><br />It is Lt. Hanna's pursuit of McCauley's gang that forms much of the film narrative, and the gang faces its own problems when rogue gun for hire Waingro is too trigger happy, and is later hired to bring down the gang.<br /><br />The film contains many exciting action scenes, and it is rare for a film of this genre to have such an accredited cast who provide a solid performance.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W.

<meta name="summary" content="Entertaining Nonsense of 'Global Warming Disaster' Filck"></head><body><p>Come on, everybody!  What did you expect from HIM?  I know your complaint, but it's Roland Emmerich, who directed 'Universal Soliders' 'Independence Day' or US version of 'Godzilla.'  Story is not only silly, but awfully told, with cardboard characters thrown in, whose presence means nothing before the costly special effects.<br /><br />As I said, the story is something like this: THE EARTH MEETS ANOTHER DISASTER again (after the numerous ones in the decade seen in 'Armageddon' 'The Core' and so on and on).  This time the much-worried global warming is the cause, which brings lots of terrible things to the humans, providing the good occasions for CGIs to impress us.  Blizzards, storms, even hails in Tokyo, which looks more like Chinatown (sorry, but I coundn't ignore the inaccuracy as I am a Japanese).<br /><br />Anyway, people are terrified, but not defeated.  But 'The Day After Tomorrow' features the human relations under this catastorophie, too, and here enter Dennis Quiad and Jake Gyllenhaal as father and son, whose shaky bond is tested by the disater. Reliable veterans like Ian Holm or Sela Ward add some aspects of humanity to the otherwise mundane story.  Ok, but what I really want to say is ...<br /><br />EMMY ROSSUM, what are you doing here?  She provides a love interest for Jake, but all you can see is her character doing nothing but things required in this kind of blockbuster films ... in short, to be saved.  Her stunning presence (and angelic voice) in 'Songcatcher' is nowhere to be seen.<br /><br />Well, I admit the CGIs are great, but I think we have seen too much of New York City attacked by disaster, especialy when you remember 'Deep Impact.'  To make matters worse, the silly, awfully silly story fatally damages the emotional impact that the film intends to give us.  See the characters do unaccountable things, including the cat-and-mouse chase with the ... er ... wolves on the frozen deck of a ship.<br /><br />ULTIMATELY THIS IS A THREE STAR FILM, but Emmerich, unbelievable as it is, tries to insert social messages directed to the US government, so that only northen hemisphere seems to have to suffer from the disaster.  Please, Mr. E.,  I like your pro-American style in 'Independence Day' which no one took seriously.  And here no one will either.</p></body></html>

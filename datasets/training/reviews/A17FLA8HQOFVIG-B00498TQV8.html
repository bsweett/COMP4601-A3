<meta name="summary" content="A heroine to admire in a harsh, realistic and worthwhile film"></head><body><p>This 2010 Sundance Film Festival award winner is the story of Ree, a courageous 17-year old young woman in rural Missouri.  She cares for her young brother and sister as well as her mentally absent mother under extremely stressful conditions.  Sometimes the neighbors help out but the family lives in poverty.  The father cooks methamphetamine and is out of jail on bond.  But he has disappeared, and if Ree doesn't find him, the family property will be confiscated.  This is a horrible situation for anyone to find themselves in, but Ree, played by newcomer Jennifer Lawrence, has the kind of inner strength that makes her confront all the forces that try to hinder her search.<br /><br />John Hawkes is cast has her father's brother and he seems to know more than he is letting her know.  And her other kinfolk are close-mouthed and aggressive.  She is even beaten up by some of them.  But her determination in the face of seemingly impossible odds make her the kind of heroine to be admired.<br /><br />There's constant tension in this film and some rather gruesome details.  But how it all plays out is positive and believable and made me want to applaud this very special heroine.  This is truly a worthwhile film even though it depicts a sad and difficult way of life.  Film aficionados will love it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="2-Disc Set Does Iron Man Justice!"></head><body><p>There is a lot to `give away' in describing "Iron Man', but suffice it to say that the film makers have created the real Tony Stark.  He is the rowdy billionaire responsible for building weapons of mass destruction and selling them to the enemy who then turns into a reluctant and then powerful `Iron Man'.  The cinematography is stunning in Blu-ray and the scenes starting from Afghanistan to Los Angeles's skies are over-whelming.  The action is intense, funny, witty and true to the character of the comic book character.  Plus, it is all believable.  Robert Downing, Jr. playing around with his Iron Man invention is nothing short of hilarious and thrilling.  Gwyneth Paltrow is a bit underused as his assistant, but she supplies some killer one-liners.  Jeff Bridges plays a role that truly threatens Iron Man, but that's all I'll say.  The effects are fantastic, the storyline is fast and clever and it is no small wonder it broke box office records.  On Blu-ray disc, it is just as good as being in a movie theater - the details, color and sound are that amazing!  Tony Stark IS `Iron Man'.<br /><br />All Blu-ray discs are set up differently according to their theme, but for Iron Man, I'll describe the screen imagery.  The initial PLAY/SCENES board is a colorful statue of Iron Man with colorful, comic book scientific looking diagrams.  Audio is available in English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD, French 5.1 Dolby Digital and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French, Spanish and Portuguese.  There are some great extras like the `Hall of Armor' showing all four Iron Man designs, `The Invincible Iron man' and deleted scenes.  These deletions are great, including, 'I Am Iron Man', `Visuals Effects of Iron Man', a fantastic `Robert Downey Jr. Screen Test'. 'The Actors Process' (Downing and Bridges get down with some real improvisations), a semi-spoof trailer from `The Onion' on Iron man,' Theatrical Trailers, Galleries, Credits and Subtitles.  Not to leave anything out, more extras include six mini features such as `Friends and Foes' and "Demon in a Bottle".  If you're really into Blu-ray, try connecting to the Internet for BD-Live capability. This is one of the Blu-ray features that put it so far and above regular DVD.</p></body></html>

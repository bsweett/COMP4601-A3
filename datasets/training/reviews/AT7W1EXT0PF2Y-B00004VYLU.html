<meta name="summary" content="Goodfellas -- A review"></head><body><p>This is one of the silliest movies I've ever saw. Take our Main Character, Please. He can barely play a straight man let alone a gangster. Sorry writers, but a wimpy man with an affected accent telling us his life story is not a good movie. "Now let me tell you about Paulie." Sorry we don't give a damn. Next we have Robert De Niro, yep the man who played the Godfather got stooped into playing in this turkey. Sorry, Bob. At least his character is likable. Next in the trio is Joe Pesci, - after playing the villain in Michael Jackson's Moonwalker he got a big head and thought he was a real actor, sadly enough that role was Oscar worthy compared to this.<br /><br />If these guys weren't enough, enter our main character's girlfriend. She's ok until she starts talking, then its zero to tramp in 4.8 seconds. After about three consecutive scenes of this trollop in training I turned the movie off; and I've sat though some bad movies in my time. It'd be ok if this was supposed to be a comedy, but they try to pass it off as drama. Really, at one point we are actually introduced to a character named something like "Jimmy Two-times - because he says everything two times. Says everything two times. I'm not making this up! Unless you're a film student studying bad movies, don't watch "Goodfellas".</p></body></html>

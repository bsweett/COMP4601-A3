After their father dies, Francis (Owen Wilson) organizes a trip for them to reconnect on a spiritual tour of India. So Jack (Jason Schwartzman, also acting as co-writer with director Wes Anderson) leaves behind the hotel room he's been living at for months in France and his neurotic girlfriend (Natalie Portman), and Peter (Adrien Brody) leaves his pregnant wife behind for the spiritual "retreat." Traveling around India on The Darjeeling Limited the three brothers try to find themselves, each other, and possibly their long lost mother (Anjelica Huston).<br /><br />Wes Anderson is the king of quirky indie style comedies. Before the indie movie scene was "cool", Anderson was making movies like Bottle Rocket and Rushmore. Often copied but never duplicated (the closest being Anderson protege Noah Baumbach's The Squid and the Whale), one of the things that makes Anderson's movies so great is his ability to walk that fine line between depressing and funny, and pathetic and sweet. Writing satirical stories about dysfunctional relationships, neurotic individuals, and upperclass families unhinged from reality, Anderson has definitely carved himself a unique niche with the film world. So how does this film stand up against Bottle Rocket, Rushmore, The Royal Tennenbaums, and The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou?<br /><br />In all honesty, and this might be hard to believe, I think this is Anderson's best movie to date (I should say the best Anderson movie I've seen since I still have yet to see Fantastic Mr. Fox). By shooting this film in India, he gives this film a unique flavor from the rest of his films, while still seeming familiar at the same time. Of course, that familiarity can be attributed to Anderson's use of many of the same actors as he's used in his other films (of the American actors in the film, only Adrien Brody hasn't appeared in a Wes Anderson film), not to mention the familiar subject material from his previous movies. The smaller sets, and closer proximity of the characters, as well as the smaller cast also make this movie feel more personal and allowing you to get closer to the characters. One thing that I've noticed in a lot of indie films these days is giving characters quirks that don't really define the characters but are there just to set the movie apart from the mainstream. Here, Anderson's characters have quirks, but the quirks are defined by the characters relationships and who they are rather than the other way around. Throughout the movie we see Wilson's character with bandages covering a large portion of his head and face, it seems like it's just a quirk the writers threw in to make the character seem more interesting, but when you find out the truth, it makes complete since in the scheme of who the character is.<br /><br />As with any Anderson movie the acting is impeccable, and adding Oscar winner Adrien Brody to his film making "family" was an inspired choice. Each of the actors playing the brother is completely believable in his spot in the pecking order. Wilson as the oldest, and as the one who practically raised the other brothers, is authoritative to a fault and tries to hide a more emotional interior from his "frailer" brothers. Brody plays the middle brother who sometimes feels like he's fading stuck between the other two and tries to break out of the mold by taking things important to others to find an identity and at times rebels against his older brother. Schwartzman, as the younger brother, is the impressionable one but just kind of wants to go with the flow of what the other brothers are doing. Each actor exemplifies these roles to a tee, but the real standout is Wilson. Unfortunately, as we found out later, his character may have been a little closer to his reality then we'd like to have thought.<br /><br />If I had one problem with this movie it's that I don't get the use of Bill Murray as The Businessman with just one line. I guess had it been a no name actor I probably wouldn't have even thought about this point, and Anderson might have chosen to put Murray into this role because Murray's become something of a talisman to him since he has appeared in all of Anderson's movies except for Bottle Rocket. Still, because of Murray's involvement I kept thinking there was going to be something more to the movie that never came about. Due to this distraction from the rest of the movie, I find the role actually to be somewhat detrimental to the movie as it really serves no purpose in the grand scheme of things.<br /><br />I highly recommend that you give this movie a try, especially if you like Anderson's previously efforts or other independent film. As with all of his movies this is kind of a love it or hate it affair, but there's a lot to like about this movie from the look at a different culture, to the acting, to an interesting and engrossing story. Also if you check out the DVD make sure you watch the short film before The Darjeeling Limited called Hotel Chevalier.<br /><br />4.5/5</p></body></html>

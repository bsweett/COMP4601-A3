He teams with Lisbeth Salander, a woman who, let's just say, is very unique. She is a computer hacker who early on in the film takes revenge on a man who brutally rapes her. The two are working together to solve the mystery of Harriet, who mysteriously vanished years ago. The film is technically outstanding, well-acted, and it maintains the realism and brutality of the rape and revenge scenes involving Lisbeth Salander. Unfortunately, the movie is overlong due to an unnecessary revenge sequence involving a businessman that the journalist had been convicted of libeling. With David Fincher at the helm, I expected a great film, but what I saw was merely a good one.</p></body></html>

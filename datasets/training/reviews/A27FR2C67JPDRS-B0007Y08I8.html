I thought it looked really dumb and decided not to see it.  A friend of mine (through a lot of convincing) got me to see the film and I'm glad I did.  Crude humor, politically incorrect and puppet sex----what more could you ask for!  The film is send up of all those patriotic action films with tired formulas and horrible dialogue.  But the writers also skewer pretty much everyone else---actors, dictators and more.  If you are looking for a lot of laughs from a very guilty pleasure, this film is for you!  Not for everyone but recommended!!!</p></body></html>

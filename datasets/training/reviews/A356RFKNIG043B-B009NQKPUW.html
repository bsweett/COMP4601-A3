<meta name="summary" content="Ridley Scott, master of wild eye candy, delivers an incredible blu-ray"></head><body><p>4.5 stars<br /><br />Prometheus sure ain't for everybody; it's too slow for horror fans, too horrific for art house fans, too anti-romantic and too weird for many in general. But I've been loving Scott's work since going to Alien as a kid in 1979 and for me this is perhaps the perfect summation of many of his themes and the consummation of many of his incredible visual signatures.<br /><br />The opening of Prometheus is just mind-blowingly stunning, Lord Of The Rings epic but with its own special otherworldly feel. The Iceland landscapes are stunning, and as at various points during the film my jaw literally dropped in true amazement at both the perfection of the framing and the insane depth and color of the blu-ray image. This has got to be the best BD transfer I've ever seen except perhaps Baraka and Up.<br /><br />Add to that the sort of attention to quality and detail that all good movies deserve on BD, and you've got a disc that's well worth the 20 clams they want here. The dvd is only a sad reminder of how awesome 50gb of BD space can be when used for an image this crisp and a soundtrack this wide and how 7.4 gigs just can't ever compare.<br /><br />How much time did they spend making this blu-ray good? Well, the movie audio has 28 different subtitle tracks. 28! Including two commentaries in various languages. Even the well-laid out deleted scenes have 18 subtitle tracks. Normally it's a miracle to get one. The Weyland film they made just as an extra is another excellent addition with lots of good ideas the film couldn't assimilate.<br /><br />But caring about every detail like that is Scott's hallmark, and his exemplary commentary is typically sharp and incisive, with many drily humorous thoughts on the film making process and some great jabs at the moneymen who still don't let him do what he wants, despite a career as fine as almost any modern director's.<br /><br />The deleted scenes extra shows how wisely ruthless Scott can be as an editor; many fine things were dumped but in hindsight you can see why he cut each one, as good as some were. He wants to preserve the mystery and weirdness that comes with leaving out some details, and he gets so much intense atmosphere so often that he makes most directors seem like they're still in film school.<br /><br />Whereas the details he leaves in, with many references to his own masterpieces Blade Runner and Alien and also 2001 and other sci-fi landmarks, all work together to highlight the truly interesting central conceit here: the earth as petri dish for people. If you've read much Sitchin you know this idea is rich with possibility and perhaps even probability. Scott plows into it with verve, and the effects and cgi folks do him proud.<br /><br />There are some cgi scenes here that redefine the art, especially the alien ship cosmos map scene. Wow. Watch that in slo-mo on a good LCD screen and be awestruck. I really wish I'd seen this in an Ima. Sigh.<br /><br />But movies do not live on images alone, and the performance that really carries the drama is from Fassbender, who takes Rutger Hauer's emotional ice from Blade Runner and warms it up to vapor, saying volumes as the perfectly sly cyborg with wry glances and deft details of movement.<br /><br />Rapace and Elba certainly have their moments, and no one is weak, but it's the visual splendors that are the real star of this film.<br /><br />All that said, this is not for everyone. It's too harsh and too slow if you're not totally into the tale, and I could see where it could drag. But if you love sci-fi, the art of film and an epic film maker with a truly unleashed imagination, Prometheus is a delight that will only get better as time goes by.<br /><br />It also highlights various parallels between Scott and James Cameron in both epic scope and idea (each also chose Sigourney Weaver as his favorite hero archetype---the indomitable professional woman), but Ridley is more about the mind game while Cameron goes for the heart. This makes his films much more successful, but I think as time goes by Scott's vision is emerging as one of the finest of all living filmmakers. Who else has done a film like this and also (the sadly neglected but wonderfully sharp) Matchstick Men? Now that's breadth.<br /><br />I've always dreamed of a sequel to Blade Runner, and I guess this is as close as we'll get. And while it lacks BR's once-in-a-lifetime feel, it has a visual sophistication that not only makes BR seem primitive but redefines how wild a movie can look while still seeming real. My eyes are still reeling.<br /><br />The main qualm I have is the music, which is always big but never deeply memorable like Vangelis' incomparable Blade Runner OST. It's the Giger-esque imagery that haunts the brain most here, and Scott's various tributes and nods to his filmic past make Prometheus a many-layered visual and mental splendor for cinephiles with patience, open minds and hungry eyes.</p></body></html>

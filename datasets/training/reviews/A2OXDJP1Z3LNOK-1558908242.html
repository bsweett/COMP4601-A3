Whenever you find yourself laughing at something that you shouldn't find amusing, you know you are watching a good movie. This was also John Travolta's resurrection.  He is incredible  as Vincent Vega.  Sam Jackson is also hysterical as Jules.  Overall this  film keeps you wrapped up and interested.  You only see all the  significance if you watch the whole thing intently.  Great movie.</p></body></html>

Hulk is that character in comics that was never truly identified to be either a hero or a villain. He is both in my opinion. He is his own enemy, Banner has to fight with his inner self (literally) the struggles between Hulk and Bruce Banner are as plausible as that of Kent and Superman, or Wayne and Batman. The only problem is how the story is adapted.<br /><br />In this first adaptation, which in fact isn't that loyal to the comic book origins; begins the story of tormented scientist Bruce Banner and his search for a new means to heal and cure people in a way never imagined. His attempts fail after he is exposed to gamma rays. This of course unleashes what is already inside of Banner. Now there are many details in the movie that I'm not gona ruin, for that you would have to see the movie. The issue with why people dislike the movie is because it takes almost 45 min of the movie to finally see Hulk.<br /><br />The movie dwells to long in the past of Banner, now I agree origin is good but in a balanced manner. The effects are amazing with out a doubt...But the storyline a times drags to long. Not to mention the final fight scene this is too dark and poorly conceived. Conclusion, rent it before you buy it. Only buy it if you are a fan of Hulk or comics.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 ? OUT OF 5</p></body></html>

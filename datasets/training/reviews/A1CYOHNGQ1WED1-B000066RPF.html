<meta name="summary" content="That's no ordinary movie . . . look at the bones"></head><body><p>No movie I have ever seen makes me laugh harder or more consistently than Holy Grail. And that's after seeing it enough times that I've become one of the annoying legion who can quote entire scenes from the film. Python are a rare combination of physical, low brow, silly, and philosophical humor. Some scenes you laugh at because they are so stupid (killer rabbit), others because they are so absurd (Black Knight) and others because of the amazing language used (anarchosyndicalist commune).<br /><br />Even though in my opinion this is the funniest movie ever made, I didn't give it 5 stars because as with most movies, it is not perfect. It falters in the last half hour and the ending leaves something to be desired. If you already know Python and don't like them, this movie won't change your mind. If you don't know them, this is the perfect place to start and if you're already a fan you didn't need to read this review because you've already seen the movie a hundred times.</p></body></html>

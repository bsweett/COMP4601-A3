<meta name="summary" content="One of the creepiest films I have seen in a long time."></head><body><p>THE ORPHANAGE is scary.  Not Hollywood-hey-let's-show-all-our-cards scary.  I'm talking about cover your eyes, look away, symbolic terror.  A woman wiping her face with what we know to be human ashes.  Creepy figures half-seen and then gone.  This is a film that gets under your skin.<br /><br />The plot is fairly simple: Laura moves into the orphanage where she grew up.  With her is her adopted son Simon and her husband Carlos.  Before moving into the Orphanage, Simon had two imaginary friends; after a day in the new place, he has six.  And then a strange old lady shows up...and then Simon goes missing.  Months pass, and eventually Laura feels compelled--against her husband's wishes--to seek help from beyond.<br /><br />The film plays with typical horror stereotypes: creepy old buildings; creepy little children; creepy old people.  What makes everything work here is director J.A. Bayona's understated style; he doesn't spell things out for us, he lets the tension--and character development--build, until we reach a gut-wrenching climax.  You can see it coming, of course; the problem with horror films these days is that there's not a lot that hasn't been done.  Thus, we must focus on HOW it is done; and in this regard, THE ORPHANAGE excels.<br /><br />The lead performances from Belen Rueda and Fernando Cayo are rock-solid; supporting roles--especially an incredibly spine-chilling turn from Geraldine Chaplin--are just as good.  In case you're wondering: Guillermo Del Toro's presence is felt, but only in an off-hand way.  Some scenes are so horrifically beautiful, one can't help but be completely awed.  This is, ultimately, a beautiful little film; not the greatest horror movie ever made, but certainly a rare treasure, and proof that there is still gold to be mined in the genre, even if it takes a fresh face like Bayona to find it.</p></body></html>

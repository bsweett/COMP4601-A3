<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing Thriller"></head><body><p>PHONE BOOTH is the second pairing of director Joel Schumacher and star Collin Farrell; unfortunately it is a disappointment compared to their first collaboration, &quot;Tigerland.&quot;  Farrell playes a sleazy, small-time New York press agent.  He lies to his clients, the press, and anyone else he can use.  This situation comes to a head when he is pinned down in a phone booth by a sniper.  <p>Schmuacher can be a good action director, so I was expecting much more from this movie.  Even though the movie is short (my DVD counter said 89 minutes), it really drags at times.  Farrell is pretty good, but we don't get to know much about his character before the sniper incident, so I really didn't care much about what happened to him.  The characters also tend to be a bit over-the-top, expecially the three prostitutes, who add some unintentional (?) humor.  Also, PHONE BOOTH is ultimately too preachy and moralistic for it's own good; it's simply too shallow of a movie to pull it off well. <p>Perhaps the best part is Schumacher's director's commentary; Schumacher is a solid director and he knows the kind of information that will be of interest to the audience.  Too bad he didn't have as much sense when he was making the movie.</p></body></html>

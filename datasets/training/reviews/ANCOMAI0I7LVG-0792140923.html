It's what happens when you take a clich&eacute; ridden story and fill it with gimmicky characters who speak mind-numbing (albeit entertaining) dialog.  There is a layer of originality that spreads itself thin over the film, but overall the film is bogged down by its own aspirations.  It is trying way to hard and failing most of the way.  It is not a bad film, but it is no where near the top of the pack, not even in 1994, which was a sub par year in general.<br /><br />I know that `Forrest Gump' has its rabid supporters (thus the reason that every review under a five-star gets trashed by the next reviewer) and I am literally stripped of my dignity every time this movie is brought up among friends since apparently I am the only person I know who sees that there is simply nothing here to get excited over (actually I do remember one time that one of my friends nodded in agreement with me, and then his wife let us both have it).<br /><br />So I don't get yelled at, there are some spoilers below, so be forewarned.<br /><br />So, here are my issues with `Forrest Gump'.  The story is actually good in my opinion, or at least the idea behind it.  Having one man make an unintentional impact on the entire world and be utterly clueless to it is actually interesting.  If the plot hadn't been muddled with clich&eacute;d characters from the very beginning then it really could have been worked into genius.  But that wasn't the case.  The character of Forrest isn't the biggest clich&eacute; (although he is clich&eacute;d, don't get me wrong) but all the people around him (from his mother to his war buddy to the love of his life) are so `been-there-done-that' that I can't understand why someone didn't stop production and ask why they couldn't create something a little different.  The performances for the most part work to elevate the familiarity (especially Wright, whose character is probably the most clich&eacute;d in the bunch) but it doesn't really help much.<br /><br />Another problem that I have with `Forrest Gump' is Tom Hanks.  Hanks is kind of like the king of gimmick for me.  I don't think he is the strongest actor and it feels as if he relies to heavily on his characters gimmick's to elevate his performance and acceptance.  He won back to back Oscars for barely doing anything.  Really, he played a man dying of AIDS and then he played a man mentally handicapped, the two biggest Oscar bait gimmicks out there, but his personal performance was nothing spectacular.  The final frames of the film are truly the strongest, and yes, when he realizes that he has a child his reaction is raw and real and heartbreaking, especially when he asks if his son is smart, but honestly that is one scene (the best scene in the film mind you) and one scene does not make you a good actor.  Robin Wright Penn and Gary Sinise are actually very good here (Sally Field cannot step out of her character clich&eacute; long enough to do anything decent here) but there performances are muddled down by the mediocrity surrounding them.  I am not for one minute saying that no movie should be made about wounded war vets or the mentally handicapped or the drug addicted floozy, but when so much of it is thrown into the same pot it begins to feel as if no one involved with this project has an imagination.<br /><br />The film feels very force-fed at times, like it's spoon feeding the audience mouthfuls of manipulated sympathies.  I know that I am like the last person to complain about that since I cry every time I watch a Ron Howard film (talk about emotional manipulations) but Ron Howard has a way of making all that syrup go down smooth; and Zemeckis doesn't (at least for me).<br /><br />I just don't buy it.<br /><br />I don't know, maybe I am really harsh and maybe I take life way to seriously as some angered reviewers have claimed anyone who doesn't rave this movie must do.  I'm not saying that it isn't entertaining and even enjoyable.  This is just not an Oscar movie.  It's more of a C+ than an A+ in my book.  Like I said, it's done well, really well, but that still doesn't make up for the lapses in judgment on the part of the writers, directors and lead actor (at least he tries in some scenes here as apposed to his horrendously mediocre `Philadelphia' performance the previous year).  When I look back at the films that `Forrest Gump' beat out for the top prize (namely `The Shawshank Redemption', `Pulp Fiction' and the un-nominated `Heavenly Creatures') I am dumbfounded that the world fell for this living breathing clich&eacute;, wrapped in a feel good package.</p></body></html>

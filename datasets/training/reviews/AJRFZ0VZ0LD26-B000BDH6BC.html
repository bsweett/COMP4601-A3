<meta name="summary" content="Revenge and brotherly love"></head><body><p>Four adoptive brothers find each other again when they learn that their foster mother has been killed in seemingly random grocery store robery in Detroit.  These four brothers have been social rejects due to their difficulty adjusting to the real world.  They are thugs with weakness for their mother who was the only person on earth to show them real love and give a new chance in life.  As brothers learn that her death was neither random nor accidental, they start planning revenge against the local druglord who has orchestrated her murder.  Lots of gunshots, fistfights take place until justice of their kind is met.  This is typical good guys/bad guys movie, but it will keep you entertained.  Wonderful cast.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Fascinating documentary"></head><body><p>For thirteen summers, Timothy Treadwell lived among the wild grizzly bears of Alaska.  An untrained but fervent bear-lover, he took his videos and message of bear preservation to schools during his off-season.  This documentary alternates Treadwell's footage with interviews of his friends, family, and co-workers.<br /><br />The result is a portrait of a man with a childlike enthusiasm and certainty that he could live with the bears as one of them.  He also comes across as a grandstanding showman determined to make himself immortal.  This documentary has done that much, although Treadwell and his girlfriend were killed and eaten by one of his beloved bears.  There is no footage of bears showing anything but indifference to him, but Treadwell endlessly proclaims his love for the grizzlies and says he would willingly die for them.  One can only imagine the horror of it.<br /><br />The Alaskan footage is lovely and one is impressed with the power and size of the bears.  Unfortunately, the pristine beauty is usually interrupted with Treadwell's showboating antics.  I think he was delusional when it came to his safety and I feel sorry for those who mourn him.  Heartily recommended for nature lovers and those interested in a man recklessly pursuing a bizarre lifestyle.</p></body></html>

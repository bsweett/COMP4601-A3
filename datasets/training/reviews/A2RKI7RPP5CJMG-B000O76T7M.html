I'm a fan of the original "Predator" movies, so that's why I went to see this flick.  "Alien" and its successors never really grabbed my attention and the books that this movie is supposed to be based on can't be found at my home.<br /><br />Now that you know my background on this thing, let's get to the film, which was actually pretty good, if you go in expecting PG-13 fights and gore.  I knew from the get-go that there wouldn't be any major violence, language or sex, but the action that does appear on the screen is very good.  The special effects were flawless, and both creatures looked very believable.  In this aspect, the movie was excellent.<br /><br />The movie starts off with a really good plotline about an ancient pyramid found 2000' below the ice in Antarctica.  A crew, funded and joined by the king of solid, but average sci-fi, Lance Henriksen, investigates what's going on down there only to find the place to be a battleground for our title heroes.  The film then goes into a really, really good explanation of how these two critters came to arms against each other.  From there, the story goes into standard, but above-average action mode with plenty of violence for the adults but not so much that it turns away the always important thirteen to seventeen year-old demographic.  Before it's all over, the film actually gives you reason to pull for one of the bad boys, and it might even tug at your heart, but just a little.<br /><br />All in all, this film could have been really good if it was allowed to be an R-rated film full of really violent action.  Let's be honest, folks didn't come to see the Alien and Predator fight it out in close-ups and dim lighting.  They came wanting to see an all-out brawl between two of the sci-fi genre's biggest muscles.  I can understand why the boys at Fox wanted to keep this movie teen-friendly, since they probably make up the bulk of the audience who reads the comic that this movie is based on, but fans of the original films may be a little disappointed if they come in expecting too much.  Perhaps a sequel will come out(the ending almost guarantees one) that will be geared more towards an adult audience.<br /><br />In closing, this isn't too bad, just don't expect folks to be skinned alive or Sigourney Weaver to pop up.  I feel like I didn't waste my money on this one, and I'll probably get the DVD when it comes out.  I recommend it with reservations to big fans of either franchise.  This will probably go over better with the general audience, since they don't have anything to poke or prod the film with.</p></body></html>

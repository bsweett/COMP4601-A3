<meta name="summary" content="Slow Beginning Redeemed by the Second Half"></head><body><p>Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) had an easy life in New York during the 1960's.  He was the only child of his parents and his father (Christopher Walkin) made a decently living from owning a store.<br /><br />All that came crashing down around him when the IRS came calling demanding more money.  As things got more and more dire, his mother (Nathalie Baye) filed for divorce.  Suddenly forced to choose between his two parents, Frank took off instead with the clothes on his back and a checkbook with a balance of $25.<br /><br />Even though Frank was only 16 at the time, he was also brilliant.  He quickly figured out how to cash checks for more then he had.  That led to forging checks, which led to taking jobs as a pilot, a lawyer and a doctor, all without even a high school diploma.<br /><br />But things weren't all fun and games.  FBI agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) was on his tale.  Can Carl catch Frank?<br /><br />The movie starts out rather slowly.  Watching Frank begin his life of crime is only interesting for a little while, but it takes much longer then it should.<br /><br />Once Carl really gets into the picture and the two start their cat and mouse games the tension really picks up.  And it is hard to know who to root for, Frank to get away or Carl to capture him.  The two actors do a great job of making their characters real and sympathetic.<br /><br />The movie is based on a true story.  Since this is Hollywood, that means take with a shaker of salt.  But it is still interesting to think of a teen really being able to pull this off.  Naturally, with the advent of computer banking and added security, he'd have to work much harder to even think of pulling all this off today.<br /><br />This movie starts as a slow character study but builds into a chase movie with heart.  It's not a movie to rush out and watch, but if you are interested, give it a whirl.  Odds are you'll be entertained.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="(2.5 STARS) You Just Can't Go Wrong with the Beatles Songs"></head><body><p>"Across the Universe" is a musical with Beatles songs. But do we really need another Beatle musical (after "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band") when we already have "A Hard Day's Night" "Help!" "Magical Mystery Tour" and "Let it Be"? How about fabulous "Yellow Submarine"? But of course, I may be wrong. After all, it's the Beatles and you can't go wrong with their great songs, but as far as "Across the Universe" is concerned, I am not still sure.<br /><br />You either love or hate "Across the Universe" which is directed by Julie Taymor. Her works as film director include "Titus" and "Frida" and if you have seen her previous works, which some viewers call creative while others, well, pretentious, you know that storytelling is not her forte.<br /><br />Because so many reviewers have already summarized the plot (or the lack of it) I will not go into the details of it. In short, a young man from Liverpool Jude (Jim Sturgess) meets Lucy (Evan Rachel Wood) in America and they fall in love with each other. The time is set in the 1960s, politically and socially turbulent years.<br /><br />So far, it is good. But the romance of Jude and Lucy needs a better story. Their story is clich&eacute;d, disjointed, and their romance is uninvolving. Moreover, "Across the Universe" runs more than 130 minutes, which is 40 minutes too long.<br /><br />But you might say it is a musical and it is music that matters. Unfortunately our Jude is no Paul and his singing is just passable. Besides, it seems some songs are randomly chosen, which do not fit in the story. Visually intriguing as it is, for example, the musical sequence featuring John Lennon's "I Want You" sequence is rather pointless, with one bizarre idea of "She's So Heavy."<br /><br />Also, many references to the Beatles songs and the group member's background (Jude's father, for instance) are thrown in. They are mildly amusing at first, but soon start to look shallow, even silly. You remember the song "She Came in Through the Bathroom Window." Yes, she really does.<br /><br />Some musical scenes are really brilliant ("I've Just Seen a Face" in a bowling ally scene and Joe Cocker's "Come Together" with a nice choreography). But as I said, you can't go wrong with the Beatles songs.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="More Action Less Substance..still a good movie"></head><body><p>X-Men III with Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman and all the others fill out this cast in a non stop action fest.  The special effects we've seen before in other films but it still stands as a solid action film.  It's something I'd watch again. Without Bryan Singer, it's still a good film.<br /><br />The film starts with the senator Worthington has a cure for mutants.  It all begins from there as there is a dividing line between humans and the serum to suppress the mutant genes, permanently.  Hugh Jackman gets most of the lines in this one.  We get to see the demise of three characters, whom I am not going to say here, but it's going to be hard to bring them back for sequels.  I only wish that there's a way to bring them back in flashback scenes or holographic programs.  The scene in the beginning took place in a Star Trek Next Generation style holo deck.  I don't know if this was done in the comic but it does lift a few Trek concepts.<br /><br />Kelsey Grammar does a superb job of the Beast.  He has a small amount of time on the screen and chews up the scenery.  Back in the 70's the Beast was the wild card member. He wasn't always that Blue Haired Wolfman.  I wish that the characters that made brief appearances had something more to do.  Colossus should have had more to do than throw Wolverine into battle.  Juggernaut had much more cunning and intelligence in the comics.  He was wearing sculpted muscles in this one.<br /><br />I was hoping that we'd get some of the comics script into the film.  In the original version, Phoenix was shot by a laser cannon unknown to Scott (Cyclops) Summers. The comics version had them in on alien planet giant arena fighting for their lives.  With CGI, it would have been possible to reproduce the environment in the comic.  I was hoping Chris Claremont would have had a hand in the script.<br /><br />The comic insert was a good addition.  They should have added the DVD ROM of the first 500 issues as a selling point.  I was disappointed to see original X-Men artists Dave Cockrum, George Perez, and Tom Palmer not have any of their stories in the comic.  I love the Jack Kirby ones but they have been reprinted endlessly in best of collections.<br /><br />The good thing I do have to say about the film is that it can be seen repeatedly.  There are a lot of comic elements that make this film a keeper.  The conflict between Xavier and Magneto is much deeper.  It's not a conventional battle because they were best friends at one time and had great respect for one another.<br /><br />From what I've read the next film is going to be a solo Wolverine film.  I'd like to see the origin of Wolverine portrayed in the next one.</p></body></html>

This pretty much has the same plot, but it's done in a very different way. I didn't like that the flying saucer was a gigantic glowing ball, but it was cool. I loved that Gort was 100 feet tall in this one and looked more scary. Keanu Reeves did a pretty good job as Klaatu, who warns that if the people of Earth that if they don't stop the violence, the humans of Earth will be destroyed. I wasn't a big fan of Helen Benson' step-son being black and hated Klaatu, because in the original, her son was white and became friends with him. (I'm not racist.) My dad might have been a little disappointed because he thought it wasn't as good as the original. I did like the awesome night scenes and when it rained. If you are a fan of the original classic, you might like THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL!!!</p></body></html>

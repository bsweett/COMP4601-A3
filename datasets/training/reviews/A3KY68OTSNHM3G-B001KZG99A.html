<meta name="summary" content="An Excellent Superhero Movie"></head><body><p>Robert Downey Jr. brings the Marvel Comics superhero Iron Man to life in this thrilling movie.<br /><br />Downey stars as Tony Stark, billionaire head of Stark Enterprises.  Taking control of the company after his father's death, Tony, along with Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) continue to manufacture different types of military weapons systems.  Their newest system is the Jericho missile, and Tony is on a mission to Afghanistan to show off the system to the military brass.<br /><br />After the demonstration, Tony hops in a Humvee.  He's talking with the others in the Humvee when suddenly, the convoy comes under fire.  Tony is eventually captured by rebels and hidden away.  He is told that, in order to be released, he must build a Jericho system for the reigning warlord.  However, Tony has something else in mind.  He instead begins construction of an iron suit.  Once completed, Tony blasts his way out of captivity.  He's finally rescued, but he's forced to leave his damaged suit behind.<br /><br />Upon returning to the U.S., Tony decides to stop all production of military weapons, much to the amazement of his assistant, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Obadiah.  Instead, Tony works on perfecting his Iron Man suit.  He even returns to the Middle East to clean up some unfinished business.  Meanwhile, Tony's company has suffered huge monetary losses due to his decision to stop military production.  As it turns out, Obadiah has had secret dealings with the Middle Easterners and is still trying to funnel arms to them.<br /><br />In the end, Tony discovers that Obadiah has betrayed him and has managed to build his own suit.  There is a huge confrontation between Tony and Obadiah, and only one will survive.<br /><br />This is an excellent movie.  Robert Downey, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, and Jeff Bridges all give first-rate performances.  The special effects are great, and there's even a little comedy thrown in, too.  I've seen each of the "Spiderman" and "Batman" movies, and I'd rate "Iron Man" as the best of the superhero films.  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Teddy Daniels is a federal marshal who is hiding something from you."></head><body><p>(I am not a verified customer because I bought Shutter Island BD at Walmart) Shutter Island is set up by Martin Scorsese as a spooky detective story, but think Scorsese, and ponder the possibilities. Leonardo DiCaprio playing Teddy Daniels, is one of our most recognizable living actors at the moment. And perhaps you are accustomed to his characters with Boston accents, who are rough around the edges and know how to use a gun and carries a badge. But Teddy Daniels is hiding a lie from you, and not until the end will you discover the painful truth.<br /><br />Shutter Island isn't a film with WETA-like effects, instead, it's a film in the hands of a true cinema master relying on story telling. You travel through a physchotic setting into delirium. I was very confused through the movie and that is the point. I questioned everything and sought clairvoyance with insanity in my vision. Teddy Daniels will rock your sane world and perhaps you will have doubts about your own reality after watching this amazing film.<br /><br />(spoilers) As described by many of the reviewers of movies the true qualities of Shutter Island comes with repeated views. You see the effort in telling a story from the perspective of a damaged human mind. You realize that the true characters are representations and that key settings and events are tragedies of Teddy Daniels. The effort and attention to detail requires that you give special praise to Martin Scorsese, yes, but also the hard working film editor Thelma Schoonmaker. These peole never get enough credit in my opinion. Many directors owe their careers to Stuart Baird, who edited the wreck that was their films. Richard Donner gives unending praise to Stuart Baird for many of his movies.<br /><br />As far as the BD as a product, I can't say Shutter Island BD's quality stands out more than say the Avatar BD. Once you've seen and heard Blue-ray you really know what to expect. The special contents are bare on the single BD. My score is a review of the movie itself.<br /><br />Techinical aspects<br /><br /> *It uses 5.1 DTS-HD master audio for english only. Special Features include: Behind the shutters in HD and into the lighthous in HD. Also, there is French, Brazilian Portuguese 5.1 Dolby Digital. Subtitles in English and Enlglish SDH, French, Spanish, and Brazilian Portugues.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Heavy on the Journey, Light in the Center"></head><body><p>Remember the old <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00007JMD8">Journey to the Center of the Earth</a> movie, with the optically enlarged lizards presented as dinosaurs (colloquially termed "slurpasaurs")?  That was what passed for a nifty special effect in 1959.  Today it's 3-D effects.<br /><br />Of course, audiences of today are far too sophisticated to fall for lizards with horns and fins glued to them; in the age of movies like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXAT">Jurassic Park</a>, only a digitally animated Gigantosaurus will do.<br /><br />This latest incarnation of Journey is surprisingly true to its <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1402743378">roots</a>: Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser) is an absent-minded volcanologist who is spending ten days with his nephew, Sean (Josh Hutcherson).  Trevor's brother and Sean's father Max disappeared a decade before looking for the center of the Earth.  Max left behind sensors that detect geological shifts in the Earth's crust and a cryptic series of notes in a Jules Verne novel (guess which one?). When one of the sensors fails in Iceland, Trevor decides to go on an adventure in 1950s fashion, bringing along his plucky nephew for the ride.<br /><br />Accompanying Trevor and Sean is the fetching Hannah &Aacute;sgeirsson (Antia Briem), the daughter of another volcanologist and the only person with any spelunking skill whatsoever.  While checking on the device, lightning strikes, our heroes dive for cover, and from there it's a lot of falling, screaming, and running.<br /><br />This is a 3-D movie, which means that at various times and for no reason whatsoever, something flies straight at the screen.  Since you will likely not have invested in the expensive 3-D glasses and you may not have even had the good sense to rent the 3-D version, this makes the movie seem even dumber than it is.<br /><br />The other surprise is that despite the dinosaurs and the hottie, this movie is aimed at a younger set.  The dialogue isn't very good, although Fraser does his best.  Sean is meant to be a wisecracking preteen modern hero, but he reverts quickly to type.  Scenes that are meant to be scary are played up for laughs: giant venus flytraps get pummeled in wrestling-style fashion, flying killer fish get batted away like softball practice, and there's a long and pointless mine cart sequence whose sole purpose is to show off the 3-D effects of the glasses you didn't buy.<br /><br />Did I mention the irritating glow-in-the-dark mascot?  There's a bird.  It follows Sean around.  Only he can understand it.  And it glows in the dark.<br /><br />Ultimately, Journey is more an amusement park ride than it is an actual movie. Because amusement park standards are much more family-friendly, Journey to the Center of the Earth is heavy on the Journey, light in the Center.</p></body></html>

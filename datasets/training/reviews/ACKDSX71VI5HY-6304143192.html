The Extra-Terrestrial" back in 1982.  I was four years old, and on vacation with my family to see my aunt in Baytown, Texas.  It was the first movie I ever saw in a theatre, and I remain thankful for having seen this on a big screen at a young age.<br /><br />Directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Henry Thomas, Drew Barrymore and Robert MacNaughton, the movie tells the story of the unlikely friendship between a young boy named Elliott and an alien.  That is a very rough outline, but the ingeniousness of the movie is the emphasis of the deep need for connection and understanding between people.  Elliott is loved, but frustrated by an absentee father and the typical harrassments of an older brother named Michael, played well by Robert MacNaughton.  Additionally, Elliott must contend with the responsibility of occasionally looking after his younger sister Gertie, played by a very young and endearing Drew Barrymore.  E.T. unceremoniously lands in Elliott's life and care after being unintentionally stranded on Earth by his kind, and the flowering of their relationship remains one of the most moving in the history of popular film.<br /><br />All of the younger actors in this movie give exceptional performances, but Henry Thomas' Elliott remains among the best child performances ever put on film.  Mr. Thomas plays Elliott as if he were a genuine boy, and naturally elicits sympathy and believability.<br /><br />Also featuring a superlative soundtrack by the great film composer John Williams(the "Star Wars", "Indiana Jones" and "Harry Potter" film series'), and impressive visual effects punctuated by a couple of famous bicycle flights, "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial" is a great classic film that I never tire of watching.  (And yes, I did cry at the end, all those years ago).</p></body></html>

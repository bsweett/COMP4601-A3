<meta name="summary" content="&quot;STAR TREK&quot; meets &quot;2001&quot; is finally on DVD!"></head><body><p>STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE/THE DIRECTOR'S EDITION delivers upon its promise: to make the film look, sound, and feel better than the original version. Robert Wise's Director's Cut delivers. The new and enhanced visual effects and new editing give it a more &quot;exciting&quot; feel, and seeing it in 65mm Widescreen is incredible! And fans will be able to enjoy more than just the movie, with hours of special features that never cease to entertain. Paramount should get on the ball and rerelease STAR TREK II with a two-disc 2OTH ANNIVERSARY SPECIAL EDITION as soon as possible! Bravos on this one, Paramount! Grade: A+</p></body></html>

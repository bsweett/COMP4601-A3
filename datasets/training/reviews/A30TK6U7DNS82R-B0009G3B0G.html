If only there could have been a way to distinguish the two eras visually, because as the movie stands now, you wind up not even caring if he's still alive in 1993 or travelling to 2007.  All they did was have little Jackie a child in one era, and a fetching young woman in another.<br /><br />I don't know, to me it was a little creepy that Adrien Brody meets the little girl when she's, what, 8?  And instantly he's touching her like crazy.  Her mother, Kelly Lynch, notices this, and screams like a shrew at him.  She's unsympathetic, but she's right on target.  In subsequent scenes it's clear he can't take his hands off little Jackie.  And then to have her grow up and fall in love with Jack all over again, what's with that?  I expected him to say, "I've been waiting for this since you were eight" when they fall into bed together (yuck, and he reveals his nasty little skinny emaciated rib body, i guess she didm't look south of his nose).<br /><br />However, THE JACKET made you think and that's a plus.  I just wonder if the screenwriters bit off more than they could chew.  The mystery of how Adrien Brody was able to cure the little autistic boy never did get solved, it continues to mystify on a mobius strip of time.  "How did you know?"  "You told me--in the future."  "You were the one to tell me--in 1993."  And what about that mysterious head trauma?  Once Adrien Brody realizes he's going to die of a head trauma in 4 days, he ransacks heaven and earth, past and present, to find out who dealt the blow.  Once you see it happen, you're like, "That's it?"<br /><br />On the plus side, Daniel Craig is out of this world and looks, in the madhouse scenes, just like the middle-aged Jack Kerouac.  Mackenzie Phillips is great.  Kelly Lynch looks super, they should have added her to the cast of BASIC INSTINCT II.<br /><br />What about Brad Renfro, poor thing?  Was he supposed to be in the movie longer?  Maybe in the original script Brody would track him  down and find out what really happened in the car with that cop.  But maybe working with Renfro wasn't as much fun as the filmmakers thought it would be.<br /><br />It was great having Daniel Craig, the new James Bond, in such a prominent supporting role, and then, as the credits play, you hear David Arnold's treatment of one of the great Bond theme songs, "We Have All The Time in the World," as sung by Iggy Pop!  Coincidence?  Or time travel?</p></body></html>

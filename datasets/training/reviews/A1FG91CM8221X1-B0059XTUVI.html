<meta name="summary" content="Magnificent Meryl, mediocre movie."></head><body><p>It's only because of the superb performances of Meryl Streep and Jim Broadbent as Margaret and Denis Thatcher that I give "The Iron Lady" three stars out of five. Without them, it would deserve two at the most. Streep as usual is impeccable; her appearance, voice and mannerisms are so perfect that for long stretches of the movie you forget you're not watching the real Margaret Thatcher. Broadbent as Denis is playful and charmingly dotty; together, he and Streep make the most delightful British Odd Couple since Horace ahd Hilda Rumpole.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Abi Morgan's screenplay is misshapen and wrongheaded, and Phyllida Lloyd's direction lackadaisical. Under their guidance, "The Iron Lady" becomes mostly the story of the elderly, demented Margaret, living in a fantasy world with the image of her long-dead husband. The story of Margaret's political rise and triumph, in which she once again made Britain--for better or worse--a haven for imperialism and laissez-faire capitalism, is tacked on almost as an afterthought. Of course the political story is the only reason the life of Margaret Thatcher is of any interest, but ironically it's the pitiful story of the elderly, fading Thatcher that holds our interest, strictly because of Streep and Broadbent. If it weren't for them, "The Iron Lady" would be a total botch.</p></body></html>

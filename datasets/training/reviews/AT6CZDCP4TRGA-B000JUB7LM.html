<meta name="summary" content="Not what it appears to be...AND ALL THE BETTER!"></head><body><p>Boxing movies are really a genre to themselves, kind of like cowboy Westerns in fact---recurring characters, plot development and themes pop up very predictably.<br /><br />"Million Dollar Baby" is no different, you'll recognize a lot of similarities (or CLICHES, to use a less flattering term) with other boxing movies, except for two things: its main character is a FEMALE boxer, and its last 20 minutes pretty much takes us on a whole other tangent.  Eastwood skillfully employs all of these well-worn familiarities to draw in as wide an audience as possible, then springs the REAL subject of his movie on us about 2/3rds of the way through.<br /><br />The only irritating thing I found in this movie was how much it stretched the viewer's credulity with the evil villain boxer (played by real-life women's kickboxing champ Lucia Ryjker) getting away with all sorts of flagrant and dirty tricks in the ring...unnecessary and obtrusive.  The fight scenes are not very realistic but still way better than most Hollywood boxing movies, particularly the ludicrous "Rocky" series.  In fact about the only boxing film that can be put on the same level as this one is Scorsese's "Raging Bull."<br /><br />NOTE: those who have not seen this film are advised to stop reading *now.*<br /><br />This film is really not about the glories of fighting in and out of the ring, but also about knowing when to LET GO of fighting, to walk away and just let a dying horse die in peace...in this case through euthanasia.  Eastwood seems to be implying that while fighting is what gets us through life very often, if we do enough of it, at some point there comes a time to simply let go of it and move on: the fighting spirit transforms into the peaceful, accepting and compassionate spirit, at last totally emptied of, and freed from, itself.  Which is pretty much what Eastwood and Swank's characters undergo.  In fact Maggie can be read as basically a representation of Eastwood's real soul, when he extinguishes her he is also extinguishing his own dead-end life that was defined by the boxing gym and his futile attempts to communicate with his estranged daughter.<br /><br />This is an Eastwood film that truly deserves its Oscars, it shows a director at the august peak of his powers.  Hillary Swank most definitely deserved hers, this is her best work since "Boys Don't Cry."</p></body></html>

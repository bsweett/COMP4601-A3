<meta name="summary" content="A well deserved Oscar winner!!!"></head><body><p>I have to admit that I'm a johnny-come-lately, having just now gotten around to seeing this film starring the lovely and talented, Charlize Theron.  Ms. Theron has had some interesting roles, (Cider House Rules, The Italian Job) but this role is the defining one of her career up to now and shows us just how well she can act.  Had she relied solely on the amazing makeup and weight gain for the role that transformed her physically, Charlize would not have been able to convince us that she was Aileen Wournos.  But she took that step a really good actor or actress makes to really become the person she is portraying and really made the role believable and thorougly watchable. Christina Ricci was also good as the young woman, who beguiles Wournos and then betrays her once the truth is revealed about her killing spree.  But it is Theron who shines and absolutely deserved the Academy Award she won for this role.  I look forward, with great anticipation, to the roles she chooses in the future and I highly recommend this film featuring such an amazing performance.</p></body></html>

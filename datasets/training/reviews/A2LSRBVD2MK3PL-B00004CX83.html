<meta name="summary" content="Easily The Best"></head><body><p>&quot;Batman&quot; is easily the best out of all the &quot;Batman&quot; films. It has a better cast than all of the other films in the series and it is the best directed one also. Michael Keaton will always be the best  Batman. The sets and production values in this film are also amazing.</p></body></html>

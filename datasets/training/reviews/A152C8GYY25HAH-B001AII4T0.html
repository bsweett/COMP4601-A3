<meta name="summary" content="Disappointing poltical / disaster thriller"></head><body><p>...<p>Ben Affleck has taken over the role of Jack Ryan, played in previous movies by Harrison Ford. Affleck is competent enough to make us forget that Ryan is suddenly thirty years younger and at the start of his career. <p>The story, at times convoluted and confusing, revolves around an atomic bomb lost in the Golan Heights in 1973 by the Israelis in one of their endless wars with the Arab world. Decades later it is unearthed by a peasant who, thinking it is a piece of junk, peddles it to an arms dealer. The dealer then sells it to a group of neo-Nazis who plan to use it to provoke a war between the United States and Russia. American officials, already suspicious of Russia's recent behavior, believe they have all the proof they need after the attack occurs. Only Ryan thinks otherwise, and it is up to him to prevent World War III. <p>The technical aspects of "The Sum of all Fears" are uniformly first-rate. The cast, which includes Morgan Freeman and Alan Bates, as well as the marvelous character actors James Cromwell and Philip Baker Hall, works hard at making their characters credible. In the end, though, they are undone by some weak scriptwriting and absurd plot twists.</p></body></html>

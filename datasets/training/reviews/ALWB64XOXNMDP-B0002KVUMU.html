On the DVD you get to see a 360 degree view of the castle and the extras are worth the price.  I still think this could become a franchise. Too bad the producers of the X-Men never made a Wolverine movie instead.<br /><br />If it wasn't for Hugh Jackman both films would have never been tolerable.  It's a testament to his talent when he can carry a movie that's almost straight special effects. Acting in front of a green screen can't be very satisfying as an actor and he pulls it off well.<br /><br />You don't have to be a fan of the monster films to like this one.<br /><br />It has enough outlandish stunts in it to make it one you can see at least twice and still enjoy. Myself, I love the old classics and hope more of them are relased with this film.</p></body></html>

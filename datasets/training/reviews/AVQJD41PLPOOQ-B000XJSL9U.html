<meta name="summary" content="Irresponsible storytelling!"></head><body><p>First, let me say that LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD is not only the worst film in the DIE HARD series, but one of the saddest, most desperate attempts to revive the popular franchise and make it "accessible" to today's younger audiences.<br /><br />The story centers on a group of computer terrorists led by a very, very young and angry man who is also a former member of our governement.  To prove a very radical point, he takes control of the United States by systematically shutting down our computer infrastructure.  And of course, being in the wrong place at the wrong time, it's up to John McClane to save the day.<br /><br />It seems that since the horrific events of September 11, 2001, we, as a country have learned nothing!  Not only did we go to war with the wrong enemy, but Hollywood film makers continue to get their kicks by seeing how much they can destroy our cities and people on screen.  In my opinion, a story about an American choosing to willfully cripple his own country in such a manner is nothing short of IRRESPONSIBLE!  Our foreign enemies need only watch a movie like LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD to be further inspired on how to attack our country again!<br /><br />I knew that I would not like this movie even before it started.  I mean, really, how much can you expect from any Part IV sequel??  I never expected to walk away feeling angry, though.</p></body></html>

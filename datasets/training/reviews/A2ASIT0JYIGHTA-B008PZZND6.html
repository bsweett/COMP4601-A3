<meta name="summary" content="Brilliant film ... but"></head><body><p>This was one of the most heartfelt films I have seen in recent years. The story of undying forbidden love in a time when it just was not accepted by society. It should be seen by all, and particularly  for the beautiful cinematography. It is however, not without faults.  Perhaps the biggest problem with the film is the role of Heath Ledger whose attempt at an American cowboy accent is so off the mark that it actually is very annoying to listen to throughout the film.  Heath mumbles his way through his role, and while he has touches of brilliance, I question why he was chosen.  Jake Gynenhaal, on the other hand, was simply brilliant and convincing throughout.<br /><br />Overall, a fascinating, brilliant film but let down by Heath Ledger.</p></body></html>

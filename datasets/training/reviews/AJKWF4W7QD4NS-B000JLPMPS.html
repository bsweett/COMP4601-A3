Undoubtadly the best modern day western, Unforgiven tells the story of William Munny (Clint Eastwood who also directed), a once ruthless gunslinger who, along with his old partner Ned (Morgan Freeman) and the nephew of one of his old partners (Jaimz Woolvett), are out to collect a bounty on the men who brutalized a prostitute in the town of Big Whiskey which is run by the sly, deceitful, and brutal sheriff Little Bill (Gene Hackman).  At first glance that seems to be the story of Unforgiven, but if you look closer there is something else there.  For years, Will Munny tried to deny what he was; a cold blooded theif and murderer and killer of women and children.  For years he tried to believe he was a changed man, but for all those long years there was something growing in this man, something that he couldn't outgun, his true nature.  The scene where he is laying there sickly after being beaten by Little Bill, when he tells Ned about his vision of the Angel of Death, he was seeing himself; and now he will be unleashed in Big Whiskey when he is pushed to his limit.  This is the incredible storytelling that most screen writers only wish they could come up with, and thanks to Eastwood's fantastic direction and incredible performances from him, Hackman, Freeman, and the late Richard Harris in one of his most colorful roles, make Unforgiven a true modern day classic.  It would win the Best Picture Oscar along with Best Editing, and Eastwood would earn an Oscar for Best Director while Hackman would deservingly win for Best Supporting Actor.  While this Special Edition DVD re-release may have some questionable extras (how about a commentary from Eastwood, Hackman, or even screenwriter David Peoples?), this is absolutely worth owning, even if you don't like westerns.</p></body></html>

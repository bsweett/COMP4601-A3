<meta name="summary" content="Outstanding performances bring stage play to life on screen"></head><body><p>CLOSER suffers from the staginess and inertia that plagues many film adaptations of stage plays, and the script sometimes reminded me a great deal of a very good imitation of Harold Pinter that just failed to be as good, but nonetheless this is a fascinating film to watch because of a bunch of outstanding performances by the four principle actors.  Although this is being primarily promoted as a Julia Roberts film that also stars the ubiquitous Jude Law, she is actually the least important of the main roles and is largely eclipsed by Natalie Portman.  Indeed, with Julia now at age 37 and about to enter a critical stage in her career as an actress, Natalie Portman could well be poised to be one of the actresses that take her place.  She is young, very beautiful (and with the body to perform a long scene very nearly nude), and enormously intelligent.  I don't think she has reached her potential yet, but her ceiling is very, very high.  So far her career has been slowed by her dedication to completing her education at Harvard, but I think that we are going to see her career as an actress take off now.  I wouldn't be at all surprised if she were to receive an Oscar nomination for this film.  I would be quite surprised if she doesn't win a Best Actress award at some point in the future.  Julia is quite good but her role isn't written to express as much personality as is Portman's, or for the two male leads for that matter.  I have always enjoyed Jude Law as an actor, but I wonder if Jude fatigue isn't beginning to set in.  I cannot remember such a large deluge by a single leading actor in such a short time, and moreover he has one more film coming out this holiday season.  Nonetheless, he was excellent, as always, as the rather unpleasant Daniel. Clive Owen is one of the more fascinating actors to arise in recent years, but I found him less effective in this film than in some others.  He has magnificently expressive eyes, but does better in roles in which he expresses himself more subtly than in this film.  He wasn't over the top, but he did come very close to being too expressive.  All in all, however, this film contained many utterly marvelous performances.<br /><br />The script was both a strength and the major weakness of the film.  Although the screenplay ultimately fails to make an especially coherent point about the nature of relationships and the kind of deceptions that populate them (along with rather mundane references to how we are all strangers to one another), Patrick Marber's screenplay (which he adapted from his play) does manage to create four strong characters who are notable for the strange dance of betrayal that they all play among themselves.  They are all much colder and nastier than real human beings are likely to be, but not less fascinating for all that.  The film ultimately fails to make much sense out of the entire role that deception plays in Alice's pretense to being someone that she really wasn't, all the way to adopting a fake name during the entirety of her relationship with Dan.  All in all, this is a film that you will enjoy for the performances, but which will delight less the more that you think about it later.<br /><br />I would make a strong recommendation for an older film that manages to address the same topic in more powerful fashion and with even better acting, the 1983 film version of Harold Pinter's BETRAYAL, starring Ben Kingsley, Jeremy Irons, and Patricia Hodge.  I personally would rather watch Pinter than someone writing in the style of Pinter.</p></body></html>

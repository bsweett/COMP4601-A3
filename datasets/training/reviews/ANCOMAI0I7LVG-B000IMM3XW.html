<meta name="summary" content="The best is yet to come..."></head><body><p>The reason I use that statement as my review title is that, while this film is good, much like `Spider-Man' and `Batman Begins', this film is trumped massively by the sequel.  That aside, this film is still very good for the genre that it finds itself in.  Superhero movies can be hard to make because there are so many devoted fans to please, and there is no way that one can perfectly transfer a comic book to the big screen.  Still, as far as they come, this is one of the better installments.<br /><br />It's a shame that the third film was such a cluttered mess (it's still better than `Spider-Mess 3').<br /><br />This film establishes the conflict between former friends Professor Xavier (Professor X) and Magneto, formerly known as Eric Lensherr.  Lensherr, facing prejudice his entire life, suffers greatly at the hands of an unkind and unsympathetic human race, who regard mutants as below them and continue to misunderstand and mistreat them.  Xavier and Lensherr, once comrades, are now rivals as their viewpoints on the world have begun to contradict one another.  Xavier believes in patience, for he feels that humans are universally good and that they will learn to accept mutants as equals, but Lensherr has grown to despise humanity and feels that the only key to happiness would be a human-free (and mutant inhabited) world.<br /><br />Thus sets the basis for the first installment in the X-Men franchise, and as Xavier's school for mutants and Magneto's band of thugs set off in search of the same girl, a young mutant named Rogue, chaos ensues.<br /><br />That good kind of action sequence chaos.<br /><br />When it comes to superhero films, the most important (or one of the most important) things to consider is the cast.  You have leagues of devoted fans waiting to put a face to the hero they have followed for years, and so `nailing' that aspect of the film is key.  For a film that is littered with heroes and villains, `X-Men' definitely has some inspired casting.  For any fan of the comic, I think there was only ONE choice for Professor X, and they got that one right.  Near unknowns (I say near because they weren't, and still aren't, BIG NAME stars) Famke Janssen and James Marsden filled out their respective roles very nicely (Janssen is a perfect Jean Grey) and Oscar winner Anna Paquin was the perfect choice for Rogue.  Ian McKellen is perfect as Magneto, and while I find that Storm didn't have much to chew on, Berry was a nice (if a tad obvious) choice.<br /><br />But seriously, this is the film that introduced Hugh Jackman to the world, and no matter how awesome the rest of the cast may be, Wolverine was the most important casting decision, and Jackman is absolutely outstanding!<br /><br />It lacks the polish of `X2: United', but it sets a nice tone for the franchise and really works in the origin stories without feeling rushed, stuffed or forced.  There is plenty of action, drama, romance and wit; and a naked blue Rebecca Romijn serves up some oddly stimulating eye-candy.  For what it is, this movie is pretty great.  I'd give it a solid B+, verging on an A-.</p></body></html>

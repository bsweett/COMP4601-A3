<meta name="summary" content="THE RUNDOWN IS A MOVIE THAT'S DEFINITELY WORTH CHECKING OUT"></head><body><p>A BOUNTY HUNTER [THE ROCK] IS SENT ON ONE FINAL MISSION INTO THE AMAZON TO BRING BACK HIS BOSS'S SON [SEANN WILLIAM SCOTT]. BUT, A LOT OF OBSTACLES STAND IN HIS WAY. HAS VERY GOOD ACTION, AS WELL AS A LOT OF GOOD JOKES. FROM START TO FINISH, THIS IS A PURE CLIFFHANGER. SO FAR, THIS IS THE ROCK'S BEST MOVIE. I RECCOMEND ALL FANS OF THE ROCK GO RENT THIS ONE NOW! AND IF YOU WANNA SEE MORE OF THE ROCK, GO CHECK OUT THE REMAKE OF ''WALKING TALL'' WHICH IS IN THEATRES NOW.</p></body></html>

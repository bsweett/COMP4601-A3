Once again, a formerly evil American U.S. Army officer comes to the aid of an indigenous people who are threatened by evil predatory U.S. imperialism.  At least that is what the filmmakers would like you to believe.<br /><br />Actually, the Japanese samurai were an oppressor class in their own right.  The samurai preyed on the peasants.  Eventually, as reformers took hold in 19th Century Japan, a new national army based on the peasantry was formed.  When the samurai rose in revolt against the reform government and attempted to restore their traditional privileges. the national army defeated them.<br /><br />The Last Samurai fails as both movie and history.  Avoid it like the plague.</p></body></html>

How is this happening?  However, this is one of those rare times when you just go with it and draw your own conclusions-and it works.  Don't ask me how.  But everything about this movie, from the writing to casting, is just dead on perfect.  What would you do if there was literally no tomorrow?  Highly recommended.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Gritty Gangster Epic"></head><body><p>Ridley Scott's American Gangster is a gritty portrait of the New York drug underworld in the early 1970's. With great performances by both DenzelWashington as drug kingpin Frank Lucas and Russell Crowe as cop Richie Roberts the film takes on both the gangster lifestyle and the currupt police problem of New York.<br /><br />The film has all the earmarks of an epic. The story written by Steve Zaillian, while a bit long at times, effectively portrays life on the streets at the time period. The camara work by Harris Savides is both gritty and dark.<br /><br />The disc I viewed was the HD DVD and while presenting a great picture and sound field is not without its problems. Now that HD has fallen to Blu Ray this may just be a passing footnote to the industry. The disc presents both the HD movie and the standard definition extended cut( some 18 minutes of additional scenes). Both versions present an audio commentary by Scott and Zaillian which is very informative. Scott takes on the problems of filmmaking on such an extensive project while Zaillian talks about the writing.<br /><br />The HD special features include the deleted scenes that were placed back into the extended version and a five minute featurette with the real Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts. The problem is that this is all that is included as extras. The standard definition disc have many more additional features that are not included in the more expensive HD package.</p></body></html>

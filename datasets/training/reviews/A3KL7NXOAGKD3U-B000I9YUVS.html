<meta name="summary" content="Scary???"></head><body><p>I am one of these people that cannot stand horror movies....but this one was not scary at all!! I found the story to flow like the typical teenage horror flick...some of the sequences were unbelievable..Selma Blair's character has this horrendous crash, then seems to be totally fine...I mean this woman's car, flips numerous times, then flies off of a cliff!!! (and into the water) come on people!!! I personally hope that this is one of the last remakes that I see, which were unindating the flim industry throughout 2005.  Time to bring new talent to life, with some new stories and such...overall grade D+.</p></body></html>

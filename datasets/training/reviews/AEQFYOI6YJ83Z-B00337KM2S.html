<meta name="summary" content="A beautiful, emotional film."></head><body><p>UP IN THE AIR is one of those small, quiet films that builds up impact, and then hits you over the heart with everything it's got.  The film follows Ryan Bingham (no relation to the country singer/composer of CRAZY HEART, by the way) as he flies across the nation firing people.  Ryan doesn't care much for love and marriage (despite his kid sister's upcoming wedding), but he falls hard for Alex, another frequent-flier.  The biggest thing in Ryan's life is his job; but that's all about to change.<br /><br />Okay, the plot for UP IN THE AIR sounds rather tedious.  And, in lesser hands, it would be.  The film isn't a romantic comedy; nor is it a serious contemplation on the redemptive/destructive power of love.  It's a commentary on the current economic status (most of the people getting fired in this film are non-actors reliving the moment they lost their job); and yet it never takes itself too seriously.  It features stellar chemistry from the two leads (George Clooney and Vera Farmiga, both deserving their Oscar nods and more), as well as strong support from Anna Kendrick (also deserving that Oscar nod), Jason Bateman, and cameos from J.K. Simmons, Sam Eliot, Danny McBride, Zack Galifianakis.  The directing (courtesy of Jason Reitman, surpassing his previous films JUNO and even THANK YOU FOR SMOKING) is top-notch, and the script is stellar; if the film has any flaw, it's that it comes off as a bit over-polished.  And yet, with such a likable and enigmatic cast (boldly led by Clooney at his finest), this film also feels organic and natural.  UP IN THE AIR is proof that serious filmmaking still exists in Hollywood.</p></body></html>

I give Spacey high marks because it is obvious that this is a real labor of love for him.  Not only does he do well with the musical numbers, but he seems to be loving every second of them.  In fact, Spacey can sometimes bother me, but here I really appreciated his work.  The only drawback was that he did look too old throughout.<br /><br />Bosworth did absolutely nothing for me as Sandra Dee.  In fact, I had to remind myself on ocassion who she was playing because I never ever felt it - she just seemed so flat.<br /><br />Overall its definitely worth viewing.  Especially for those of us who may know the great music but never knew much about the man.</p></body></html>

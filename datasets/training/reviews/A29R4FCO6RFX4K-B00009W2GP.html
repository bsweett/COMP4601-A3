Squandering a great opportunity for a satisfying conclusion while simultaneously destroying the original idea by nullifying the importance of the first. That's quite an accomplishment. Suffering from a lousy script, acting that threatens to redefine the term 'wooden' and so many frustrating Freudian overtones that it boggles the mind, one seriously now wonders if this whole idea was actually conceived as a three-part actioner rather than commercially-based money grabbing sequels tacked on to the first. RELOADED was a lame attempt at pretending it was a film on its own. We all knew it was merely two-hour exposition paving the way for REVOLUTIONS with a couple of half-decent action scenes thrown in. And it stank worse than Batman And Robin. However, with all that talk leading up to something, you would be right in assuming that the third film, like Lord Of The Rings was the ultimate payoff. Nope. Peter Jackson can actually direct and get good performances from his actors. Keanau Reeves' Neo gets more and more stilted and morose every minute, and the new supporting cast that were introduced in the second film are wasted in thankless roles here. There is less Oracle/Architect gibberish this time around, but that doesn't help much.<br />Regardless. the action should've made up its flaws. Note really; the battle of Zion is initially impressive and the CG is good, but it loses impact after some annoying overkill and suffers VERY badly from the oft-rumored 'battle fatigues' problem that is absent from STAR WARS and LOTR. All adding up to a distinctly naff trilogy that also tarnishes the first film. Shame on you Wazowskis. Booo!</p></body></html>

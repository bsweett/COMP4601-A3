<meta name="summary" content="Mafia Memoir"></head><body><p>Henry Hill died this week. He is the 'Goodfella', that this film follows. Henry, somehow, he survived all the 'wiseguys'.<br /><br />'Goodfellas' , is thought by most people, to be in the top ten films ever made. It is the best memoir or rememberances of life in the Mafia. I watched it again, and like always, was startled by the violence, the money, the greed, the attitude of non-chalance for the human life. Ray Liotta plays Henry, and this was a performance of a lifetime. He shines, this role is him. What a handsome guy, where is he, now? Robert de Neiro plays  Jim Conway, who loves to steal, that is how he gets his highs. Paul Sorbino plays Paul, the don. Joe Pesci plays Tommy, violent temper, a real psychopath . This is the grown up team, the Mafia in action. They steal goods, everything that was easily disposed of, lobsters and fish went quickly to restaurants ad eaten just as quickly. Razors, anything that did not have a method of tracing. They collected money from merchants and strong armed them. What they did not do was sell drugs until late into their lives.  Later Henry' was the drug man and big money was made, and even his wife, Lorraine Bracco, who plays Karen was addicted to the drugs, the money, the greed.<br /><br />The story is told by Henry, his love of the gangsters, always from an early age. His story is one of working his way up the ladder. Karen tells the story of the wives. It was a closed group. You saw no one else, knew no one else. Friday nights were for girlfriends, Saturdays for wives. Both were brought to the Copacabano, where the best was theirs. Through the years money slipped through their fingers. Jail was just another environment like home, but you couldn't go out. Everyone was paid off. And, then the time came when the drugs became too much and Henry and his gang were arrested. Henry turned stool pigeon and he went into the witness protection racket. He survived.<br /><br />Fabulous film by Martin Scoresese, It was written  by Scoresese and Nicholas Pilleggi. Pileggi wrote the book, 'Wiseguys', from which the film was taken. Superb, loved every minute. Well acted, directed and filmed.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 06-16-12<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000286RR0">Martin Scorsese Collection (After Hours/Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore/Goodfellas/Mean Streets/Who's That Knocking At My Door?)</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000286RP2">Mean Streets (Special Edition)</a></p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Worth Seeing for MANY Reasons"></head><body><p>Because of dubious reports on the merits of this film, I never saw it in the theatres, and only bought the single-disc DVD. After watching the film, I think it would be interesting to see the 2nd disc. "Dreamgirls" is a good film, with very good characters and character development. Bill Condon kept the essence of the goings-on, and the editing of Virginia Katz kept a good flow of events. The cast is outstanding, with Jennifer Hudson centering the film in an auspicious award-winning performance; it is a many-layered performance, and she shines brightest of all. Jamie Foxx & Danny Glover are fine, as are Beyonce and Anika Noni Rose. One of the best performances in the film is by Keith Robinson, who is usually relegated somewhat to the background, but is really a catalyst in the plot as Hudson's brother. There is also some of the best choreography I've seen in a long time (by Fatima Robinson), but not enough. The surprise cameos of John Lithgow & John Krasinski were also a treat. One thing that bothered me about previous reviewers was that it was too "white", whatever that means. Indeed, as a period piece, where Black musicians weren't allowed on shows like American Bandstand, and had to make due with their own localized record labels, those performers had to break through insurmountable barriers. These performers were intelligent people, and I'm glad they didn't resort to ebonic stereotypes. Eddie Murphy may have deserved the Oscar, if only for his long and illustrious career. But so did Alan Arkin, for the same reason; both actors were killed off early in the film. Eddie certainly gave it energy! But, in the end, it's Hudson you'll remember. Her strength and determination really commands, and she sings well, too. I never found it boring. There's more to say, I'm sure, but these are my immediate reactions.</p></body></html>

The central character, Dr. Garrigan played by James McAnvoy never existed.<br />  With that I changed my perspective & it is still a very good movie. A bit of a morality play. Of course it is the oft told tale of the corrosive effects of absolute power corrupting absolutely. Forest Whitaker playing dictator Idi Amin has the performance of his career. That & the other performances elevate this movie. Real live historical figures & events, with footage are interspersed with stories behind closed doors of the palace which are not fact.  A major movie to see just for the acting if nothing else.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Chilling Portrait of Insanity Ruined by Lack of Authenticity"></head><body><p>"One Hour Photo" is Robin Williams' second (actually first, in the order they were filmed) foray into playing the mentally-disturbed bad guy.  Earlier, he was a writer-turned-killer in "Insomnia," and now he's Sy Parrish, or Sy the Photo Guy, a seemingly innocuous photolab worker at the local Save-Mart (or some such...knockoff).  For the last thirteen years, he has developed pictures for people in the neighborhood, which means he has access to the private lives of these people, at least insofar as their lives are reflected in the pictures they take.<p>Sy has "adopted" the Yorkin family, a nuclear household that seems to have everything.  As Sy points out, "everyone smiles in their pictures, because they are moments you want to remember."  So, of course, Sy's view of the Yorkins is highly distorted: he never sees them fight, or spank their kid, or whatever goes on behind the closed doors in suburbia.  But Sy does discover something inadvertently by developing another customer's picture: Mr. Yorkin is having an affair with a woman from his office.  His vision of the prefect family ruined, Sy embarks on a mission to "punish" Yorkin for doing this to his wife and son.<p>What Sy does not know, but the audience does, is that Mrs. Yorkin is also having an affair, so it makes his "Taxi Driver"-like psychotic binge a little less noble, because it shows the hypocrisy of people who only see part of the "picture."  (Picture, get it?)  What "One Hour Photo" has going for it is that its portrait of a very disturbed individual is very well done and complete: Sy's slide into insanity is wholly believable and fascinating to watch, but sickening, like a car wreck in front of your house.  Williams pulls this off with finesse, proving he's more than Mrs. Doubtfire in the acting department.  Not once is the audience subjected to a cutesy voice or manic mood swing.  Williams' descent is both steady and inevitable, and doesn't need to rely on such devices to be effective.<p>Where "One Hour Photo" fails is in its portrayal of suburban America and the reasons for Sy's initial instability.  The Save-Mart is a sterile, white-and-gray environment that looks more like a hospital than a store.  As another reviewer pointed out, anyone who has been in a Wal-Mart knows it is a veritable rainbow of color, trying to get consumers to buy, buy, buy.  Sy's house, and the Yorkin house, are equally sterile, and even the little boy's messy room looks like a setup.  For a movie that preaches not to examine things through a single lens, it fails in this endeavor itself, never rising above an insipid and tired view of suburbia (yeah, suburban life is hollow and hypocritical, WE GET IT ALREADY) and becoming so self-conscious that it is obvious the audience is seeing through a camera lens into a created environment.  Also, Sy's admission at the very end seems like it was tacked on to "explain" his behavior, and it robs Robin Williams of the dignity he had in creating a part where such an explanation was not necessary.  It would be like Jack Torrence at the end of The Shining saying, "but my father was an alcoholic who beat me!"  Yuck.<p>On the whole, "One Hour Photo" is worth its 90-minute running time, but for a movie with such potential, it's a shame it could not realize more of it.<p>Final Grade: C</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="More 'open' than the first"></head><body><p>"Saw II" slaps us on the torture rack, then tightens the screws until every last gasp, shiver and shriek has been squeezed right out of us.<br /><br />Just when we think we've endured enough cruel and unusual punishment, director and co-writer Darren Lynn Bousman takes it up a notch with the zeal of a modern-day Marquis de Sade.<br /><br />That this first-time director performs this evisceration of our nerves, and does it so well, will likely touch off even more concerns about the extreme violence in today's movies. As it should, really.<br /><br />But, for the tough-as-Leatherface horror crowd who want to be bruised and battered by their entertainment, "Saw II" represents a cut above in the genre.<br /><br />The sequel to last year's sleeper Halloween hit wastes no time reintroducing us to the grisly handiwork of Jigsaw, a terminally ill serial killer hell-bent on testing people who have made messes of their lives.<br /><br />In the first "Saw," Cary Elwes and co-writer Leigh Whannell played two unlucky guys who wake up to find themselves chained in a dirty subterranean room, with a saw as their only means of escape. The scrappy first film had an estimated budget of $1.2 million, and went on to make more than $55 million during its theatrical run. It's been reviled, praised and rabidly discussed on the Internet.<br /><br />"Saw" had a shocker of an ending, an original villain and a delightful scream-queen performance from used-to-be golden boy Elwes ("The Princess Bride").<br /><br />In the sequel, conceived right after the first struck a box-office jugular, the cheap thrills remain, but the surprises are mostly gone. There are a few good twists in "Saw II," but none that rivals the pop-up corpse shocker from the original.<br /><br />As in the original, Jigsaw uses a puppet as an alter ego to let the cops know why he's punishing sinners unappreciative of what life has given them. A warped medieval mentality runs homicidally through "Saw II" as "screw-ups" are flambeed, thrown into a pit of hypodermic needles and clubbed on the head with a spiked bat.<br /><br />For the sequel, Bousman and co-writer Whannell up the body count, stranding eight victims in a booby-trapped house that looks like Freddy Krueger was its interior decorator. The eight must figure out how to get at an antidote before poison gas pumped into the vents does them in. Among those trapped inside is the son of a burnt-out detective, Eric Mathews (Donnie Wahlberg of the defunct "Boomtown" TV show).<br /><br />Of the new victims, the quick-fused Franky G. gives the meanest and most capable performance. Others seem to be standard horror bait.<br /><br />"Saw II" is a tighter, more focused film than its predecessor. But even though this sequel is well-made, it lacks the over-the-top campiness of the first movie.<br /><br />What "Saw II" needs is a wailing and moaning Elwes to make us snicker when the bloodletting is just too much to handle. In "Saw II," everyone is deadly serious about the carnage, which makes the film effective, but also unshakably disturbing.</p></body></html>

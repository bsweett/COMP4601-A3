<meta name="summary" content="Silence of the Lambs"></head><body><p>Easily one of the most notable and recognizable suspense thrillers, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS delivers each and every time.  It's a total psychological, suspense thriller that will intrigue you and even creep you out a little.<p>Jody Foster is Agent Clarice Starling and she's been assigned to find the mysterious serial killer who calls himself Buffalo Bill.  After doing some research on Buffalo Bill she finds out that he has a connection to imprisoned Dr. Hannibal Lechter (Anthony Hopkins).  She has no choice but to trust the deranged psychologist because she'll need every bit of information she can get from him.<p>SILENCE OF THE LAMBS is probably my favorite out of the trilogy (SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, HANNIBAL and RED DRAGON).  There isn't as much gore as there is in some other movies but this will creep you out from a psychological stand point.  This movie gets into your head a little and also into the mind of a serial killer.  Hopkins also puts on an outstanding performance as Hannibal Lechter.  He is simply amazing in this role.  Jody Foster is also very good in the role of Clarice Starling.<p>This is a hihgly recommended movie for all movie lovers, suspense thriller fams will definiarely get a kick out of this one.  Seriously, check out SILENCE OF THE LAMBS and also check out HANNIBAL.  You'll be glad you did.</p></body></html>

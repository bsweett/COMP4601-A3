<meta name="summary" content="Sickening"></head><body><p>It's a travesty.  No, not Michael Moore's latest documentary, but the health care system.  Armed with anecdotes about horror stories coming from the uninsured, the underinsured, and a wide range of denied claimants, Moore gives us a lot of reasons to come inoculated when seeing his latest movie.<br /><br />'Sicko' is broad in scope.  Filming participants in each of the aforementioned categories, he goes through the history of universal health care's failure to be enacted in the United States.  From The Red Scare of the fifties until the sweeping campaign against Senator Clinton's proposal when she was first lady, we get some colorful and interesting presentation.  In addition to the benefits of these illuminating vignettes, we see other angles.  We hear confessions by representatives at different levels of the health insurance organizations and various health care providers.  Then we go over seas and across the border to get cross sections of three countries and how its citizens reflect and cope with their universal health care systems.<br /><br />***(SAMPLER ALERT:  IF YOU WANT TO GET THE GIST OF THE MOVIE WITHOUT A FEW EXAMPLES, THEN PLEASE READ NO FURTHER)*** This film has a plethora of testimony and personal stories, so I just want to give you a few free samples.<br /><br />DIAGNOSIS-<br />  ---An uninsured Oregon man had to choose between saving his index or ring finger after sawing both tips off.<br />  ---An older, middle-aged couple who "DID" have health insurance had to sell their home and live with their daughter.<br />  ---Some insurance applicants were denied because of the proportion of their height and weight.<br />  ---A man was denied a bone marrow transplant from a younger brother because it was called "Experimental".<br /><br />AGENTS-<br />  ---Health care insurers in league with some health care providers.  Politicians, particularly (especially Moore cites)  the Republican Party.  In a segment that is particularly revealing, President Nixon says, "I'm not much for these things," in a context to help insurance companies.<br /><br />MOORE`s Rx<br />  --- Get universal health care.<br />  ---If "laughter is the best medicine" as `Reader's Digest' says, then there are ample doses in `Sicko'.  At one point, the `Star Wars' theme plays as the list of "uninsured" ailments and diseases goes up the screen like the familiar, intergalactic storyboard.  Oh, don't worry, there's more...<br /><br />`Sicko' made me enthralled and absorbed.  I loved the contrasts and information, but I felt there were a few sins of omission.  I don't contest what was "provided," but I thought it glossed over the frivolous lawsuits, even when there are plenty of legitimate ones.  Also, he skips over the downside of universal health care.  How can you not address this when Eleanor Clift on `McGlaughlin' conceded there where things wrong with Hilary Clinton's plan? (Of course that doesn't mean there shouldn't be a new proposal, but I thought it should have been addressed with his own counter-arguments.)  I loved the humor when it was prescribed, but I thought Moore relied too much on sarcasm.  Half the time it was funny; half the time it wasn't.<br /><br />Politically, I should 'fess up.  I have at times and on certain issues been conservative, liberal, moderate, malleable, and wavering.  Often I am all over the "chart".  Most of the time I confess I am both informed and clueless.  Having said that, despite the few weaknesses, Moore's 'Sicko' is a thought-provoking documentary that may very well be the best of the year.  No matter what your political stripes are, you should see this movie.</p></body></html>

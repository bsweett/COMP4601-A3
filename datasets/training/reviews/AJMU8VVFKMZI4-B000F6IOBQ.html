Yes, Yes, for the men out there, Kate Beckinsale looks great in her skin tight, black outfit.  The hybrid Michael learns to be a better fighter and we even get to see some flesh on flesh action.  My first question was of Michael's comment of Marcus being a hybrid as well.  Did I miss something?  I thought that he was the original vampire.  What is he a hybrid of?  Second question--why now?  Why was Marcus so determined to go after his brother now?  If I remember from the last movie, the elders take turns sleeping.  Given how long William has been in captivity--surely Marcus was in charge when Victor was sleeping--why didn't he try to free his brother then?<br /><br />And what was their father?  He's not a vampire nor a werewolf, but he lives all this time.  Am I to believe that he was the first Highlander or something?  I understand from the first movie that he was the first to survive the plague back in the day but it didn't explain why the man was still alive.  Plus, (just to nick pick) what are the chances of twin boys strolling around and one gets bitten by a bat and the other getting bitten by a werewolf?<br /><br />Again, this was a great Saturday flick.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Good thriller!"></head><body><p>Unlike Hollywood, British-made thrillers always seem to go beyond the call of duty.  This movie is remenicent of doomsday flicks like &quot;The Omega Man&quot; and &quot;The Last Man on Earth&quot;.  Unlike those movies, this has real suspense.  The gore and blood is too much to take, but what I liked about the movie is its clever cinematography and editing.  The climax, however, left me cold asking, &quot;is that it&quot;?  Something like an unfinished term paper without a conclusion.  It could have been much better if the loose ends would have been completed.  With that said, it's still a good thriller!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An Extremely Hilarious Movie-Film!!!"></head><body><p>This movie is very funny, very crude, very racist, very sexist, and highly controversial, and I love every minute of it! Borat Sagdiyev leaves his nation of Kazakhstan and goes to America to film a documentary. He tries to drive a car, learns about feminism, sings the Kazakhstan national anthem at a rodeo full of rednecks, makes jokes about retarded people, tries to use proper manners during dinner and much more. When he sees Pamela Anderson on t.v. he travels to California to make her his wife. Another part I think is very funny is when Borat and his producer fight and run around naked in a hotel. I highly recommend BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN!!!</p></body></html>

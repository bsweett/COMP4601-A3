Based on Sony Playstation's terrifying game, a deadly virus has taken over Raccoon City and mostly everybody is dead. That's the plot, now the funnies. Michelle Rodriguez kicked some serious backside in this movie. While shooting zombies to Marilyn Manson music, the movie's action never stops. Watch commandos get sliced by lasers. Watch out! Hey, that one guy Eric Mabius looks like he's on something. Chica should've lived. Where was the mansion? Where was Chris and Jill? Instead we get &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; chick who should have kept her clothes on. Elevators are dangerous. Don't let people bite your hands. If they do, go to a doctor and say a zombie bit you. Don't trust man's best friend. Oh yeah, be sure to cook your meat, you don't want the runnies.</p></body></html>

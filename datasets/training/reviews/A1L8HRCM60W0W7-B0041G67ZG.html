I saw the denouement three quarters of the way, but in all fairness the screenplay had me engrossed and thinking twice about every bathroom break I needed to take.<br /><br />The script is somewhat reminiscent of Hitchcock's North by Northwest -- United Nations, mistaken identities, intense chases and shadowings -- but Pollack's keen sense of narrative makes sure The Interpreter plays with a full deck.<br /><br />Most refreshing feature: it doesn't tiptoe around political messages despite its Hollywood roots. It audaciously sports a white African as the pivotal character. Anyone who's lived in modern day Africa knows that much of the continent's violence is now instigated by its own indigenous reprobates, not by Apartheid. The leader "Zuwanie" and the fictitious nation of "Matobo" may well be ill-concealed allusions to General Mugabe and Zimbabwe, so the theme should be doubly resonant to those with an eye for current affairs.<br /><br />The script couches several well-meaning lines about war and international politics, and of course, the raison d'etre of the United Nations. I found most of it credible, but caveat emptor to people who are disillusioned by the UN as it stands today: prepare to plug your nose in some scenes.<br /><br />Thankfully, there's a smattering of other reasons to watch this fine production. Aerial shots of NY's streets are slick. James Howard's music employs silence to great effect, building to sensational crescendos when a standoff could be so accentuated. I gather this is the first Hollywood crew to have been allowed access to actual U.N. premises, a privilege that Pollack takes full advantage of.<br /><br />While there is some merit to the gripe that it wallows in its characters' muddy pasts, it crackles in every attempt to unravel who is playing for whom, and more notably, why. Penn and Kidman's chemistry has attracted much commentary, though I was more taken by what keeps them apart than what brings them together.<br /><br />All in all, as balanced and wholesome a thriller as any in recent memory, recommended with unbridled enthusiasm.</p></body></html>

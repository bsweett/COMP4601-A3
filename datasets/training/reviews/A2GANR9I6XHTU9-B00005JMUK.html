<meta name="summary" content="Aileen's Story"></head><body><p>I was blown away buy the excellent performance of Charlize Theron as (serial killer) Aileen Wuornos. She gave Aileen a story a voice and showed what it was like from her perspective and why she did the things she did. You can actually sympathize with Aileen and feel her pain at points in the film. But towards the end you dont know what to feel because she keeps killing innocent men. You still feel a little bit sympathetic for her even after what she has done, this film really makes you think about right and wrong and people in general. It makes you not so quick to judge others circumstances because you dont know what they are going through. All in all this is an excellant movie with great performances by all. Aileen finally has some recogniton.Wouldnt say its good recognition but it portrays her as more than a monster but also a human. All she wanted was To have a chance and im sure if she can see this now she would be happy for once in her life to have her story told and to be understood. This film portays her as a human but dosent condone or make light of her crimes , it shows it all in a raw in your face way. It shows the good and the bad. Its a well acted, very entertaing film. Highly Recomended.</p></body></html>

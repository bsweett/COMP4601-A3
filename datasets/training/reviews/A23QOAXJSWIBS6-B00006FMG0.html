<meta name="summary" content="Good film, but woefully miscast"></head><body><p>This would have been a great film had it not been for Tom Hanks.  Sorry Tom, but you just can't pull-off playing the heavy, not here at least.  Hanks certainly has proven himself as a competent actor in past films like &quot;Philadelphia&quot; and &quot;Castaway,&quot; but here I can't buy him either as a concerned father or an inner-circle gangster.  Perhaps he was hoping to shed some of his heroic underdog persona for something more enigmatic and dark, but it doesn't work here.<p>Jude Law, on the otherhand, is delightfully menacing.  The rest of the cast holds their own as well.  The writing and the themes work despite Hanks' performance.  I would love to see this remade with a less well-known and indentifiable lead.</p></body></html>

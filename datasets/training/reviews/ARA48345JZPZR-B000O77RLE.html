But, a thoroughly unneccesary section of the film where first a captured Marine is treated humanely by Baron Nishi, and then shortly thereafter, surrendered Japanese prisoners are executed by another Marine, sits in politically correct smugness smack in the middle of an otherwise decent film.  It may make the "anti-war" message, but it rang false, and at that point the film faltered.  True, earlier a Marine captive was shown beaten and bayoneted, but this was juxtaposed with another Japanese being burned to death, as if the Marine captive was being punished for that death.  The reality of these battles was something else.<br /><br />The historian William Manchester was a young Marine in the Pacific and in his book Goodbye Darkness, about his experiences, said that there was a tacit understanding between the Marines and Japanese in the island campaigns: neither side took many prisoners.  At least while the battle was raging.  That was just the way it was. Each campaign was a fight to the death.  He also pointed out that the Marines always had help from native islanders against the Japanese, not because the islanders loved Marines or even knew what an American was, but because they hated the Japanese because of their brutality toward these conquered peoples.<br /><br />Too bad, because otherwise this was a fine film pretty fairly showing the view from the other side of the cultural divide.  It demonstrates the crazy waste and harshness of the Bushido code, most especially as it is sternly and unthinkingly applied to the average drafted Japanese soldier.  It illustrates how these unyielding notions caused the needless sacrifice of their own troops in forced personal suicide and suicidal frontal assaults on fixed positions.  It also showed the human dimension of these men left to do nothing else but die on that sulfurous rock.  I had no problems with those elements of the film that depicted the common humanity of men with families and love of their country.<br /><br />I liked the view of the unconventional General Kuribayashi's strategy, often undone by the willfully obtuse views of his own officers, and the equally effective view of life as lived by the common soldier, often starved and beaten by these same latter day samurai.  The action scenes, as in Flags of Our Fathers, were well done and the production design I so admired in that film is, of course, still present here.<br /><br />I liked the actors and the interplay between them.  I admire the production values and this is often a quiet and interesting film.  I certainly have no problem with seeing the flip side of the battle depicted in Flags of Our Fathers.  I think the film was doing quite well in depicting the humanity of soldiers who, by and large, would rather be home or anywhere else.  It didn't need any extra "message" slipped in, and while it might not bother others, I found it an unneccessary excess plea, and a bit disingenuous.  At any rate, the film is worth seeing.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Political intrigue at the U.N."></head><body><p>Nicole Kidman plays a United Nations interpreter who overhears a plot to assassinate a dictator from her native country in Africa, where her family was brutally murdered.  Sean Penn is the CIA agent assigned to the case.  At first, he doubts Kidman's story and he subjects her to a lie detector test.  The U.S. security agencies are determined that an assassination will not take place on U.S. soil, but it is difficult to tell the good guys (or in Kidman's case, girls) from the bad ones.  This is a well-done movie with plenty of political intrigue and a growing relationship and mutual sharing of grief between Kidman and Penn.</p></body></html>

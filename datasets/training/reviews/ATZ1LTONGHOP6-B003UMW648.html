<meta name="summary" content="Another great adventure in Narnia"></head><body><p>One year after they returned to their normal lives in England, the Pevensie children return to Narnia, this time to help Prince Caspian (Ben Barnes), a Telmarine prince, defeat his usurping uncle and restore peace and order to Narnia.<br /><br />All of the newspaper reviews that I have read of this film, and of its predecessor, "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" have been very mediocre, and I don't understand why.  I thoroughly enjoyed both of these movies and consider them to be among the best of the wave of children's fantasy movies that have appeared in cinemas, following the success of the "Harry Potter" and "Lord of the Rings" films. In fact, I preferred the Narnia films to the both of these above-mentioned series. I thought they were considerably more exciting and thought the children to be far more realistically portrayed than Harry Potter and his friends.<br /><br />"Prince Caspian" is essentially a war film and the film mostly comprises a series of battles. In other hands, over two hours of cinematic battles could be the sort of thing to put some audience members to sleep, from the sheer repetitiveness of what is going on, but writer/director Andrew Adamson brings enough variety to the action and also includes enough character interaction between the battles to maintain the audience's attention and to make them care about whether our heroes actually win or not.<br /><br />Be aware, in most countries this movie has a PG (or equivalent) rating, which suggests that this film is suitable for children. Although there is no swearing or sex, and no one actually bleeds in any of the battles, there are many elements to this film that could potentially disturb young children. When I saw this film, a family with young children was sitting behind me, and one of the children spent the film sitting in his mother's lap, hiding is face from the monsters and other "scary" creatures that were appearing on the screen.</p></body></html>

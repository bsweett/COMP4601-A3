I feel that we were ready, but I'm afraid to say that this film just doesn't quite bring us there. It delivers on a few levels but fails to really serve to the viewer the true feelings and emotions of that fateful day, mostly because the attacks are never seen and the devastating true story revolving to policemen John (Cage) and William (Pena) is so watered down that it loses every ounce of feeling while either of them is on screen. That's not to sound harsh, and as I'm writing this I'm wondering how many pissed off Americans are going to rush to hit the `not helpful' button, but I have to be honest. I felt absolutely nothing for either actor because to me they brought absolutely nothing to their character. Michael Pena did do one up on Cage by revealing some depth in emotion on a few pre and post accident scenes, one when he first hears of the attack and is wanting to call his wife and the second when he is in the hospital fighting with his wife over the baby name (his wife Alison, played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, is pregnant in the movie). Cage though was completely dead to me, evoking absolutely no emotion whatsoever, and Maria Bello floored me in her lack of depth for after her brilliant performance in last years `History of Violence' I expected the most from her.<br /><br />I did find a small glimmer of light though, and that was in the eyes of the extremely talented Gyllenhaal who just illuminates the screen every scene she as in and I'm hoping will finally pull out an Oscar nomination because of this. If anyone in this film deserves it it's her. Her tortured performance as a pregnant woman coming to terms with the fact she may indeed be a widow soon with the very fact that she must tell her four year old daughter hanging over her head was the most moving and emotionally gripping aspects of this movie, and quite frankly the only reason I shed a few tears (the whole scene where she's fighting with her husband (playfully) about the baby name is so touching). The rest of the supporting characters are so underdeveloped and or just plain ignored that they become a waste of space, and in the case of Stephen Dorf and Michael Shannon, a complete waste of talent for even they brought absolutely nothing to the picture, Shannon going as far as to deliver one of the worst performances I've seen all year. I guess I just expected a lot from this movie, I expected to feel so much different when walking out of it, but instead of feeling a sense of heroism for the two leads or a sense of remorse and or depression for that horrific day I was left wanting and even, dare I say, a bit annoyed that what should have and could have been a great and truly inspired film became nothing more than a movie. It was okay, but nothing special, and judging by the source material it should have been something VERY special.<br /><br />I do feel a bit of sympathy for director Oliver Stone because it's obvious the man is a man of vision, he's just losing his footing somewhere in delivery. This isn't his first falter for 2004's `Alexander' was an equal disappointment. We all know that Stone can manage a good if not great film, for just look at `Natural Born Killers' or `Nixon'. In the past Oliver was able to hone his skills and deliver to us a brilliant cinematic experience, but of late he's been so focused on the boring details that he loses the whole purpose of what he's trying to convey, he loses what really makes these stories worth telling, and in effect he loses us, the viewer, and that's a very bad thing. I was skeptical about seeing this film because the critics were even saying that it was very watered down and unsatisfying, but I stuck to my guns like I always do and was prepared to once again disagree with the paid professionals, but in this case I have to suck it up, reign in my pride and eat crow because the critics were right. It's not horrible, but it's not great, and that's a shame, because it should have been just that...great.<br /><br />At least we had Gyllenhaal...</p></body></html>

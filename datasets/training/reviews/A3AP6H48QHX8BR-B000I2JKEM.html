<meta name="summary" content="This movie needs to DIE..."></head><body><p>I LOVED "Nightmare Before Christmas" so when I heard that  Tim Burton was making "The Corpse Bride" I did not hesitate to go to see the movie in theaters... I left the theater absolutely amazed at how bad one movie could possibly be. What was Mr. Burton thinking?<br /><br />The characters in this film have no endearing qualities, are rather boring and un-responsive. The music is simply dredful and the acting horrible. How did Mr. Burton get associated with such mindless, pointless dribble is my only question?<br /><br />The movie takes place in the Victorian age when two people married to enhance the family wealth. A shy geeky looking Johnny Depp must marry a woman he hardly knows. Unable to accept the path that has been choosen he wanders off into a nearby woods praticing his vows and suddenly a corpse appears in a wedding gown. Unknownly he was just wedded to a corpse and is transported underground to deal with the wife that has magets that talk through her eyes and the typical ghosts and goblins. The corpse apparently had been murdered by a man who said he loved her but, really wanted the family money- this betrayal causing her to wait in her wedding dress for someone who would actually love her...<br /><br />The movie plays out as a melodramatic, clay matic horror come to life. The story is boring and unimiganitive. Possibly one of the worst movies I seen made and made me want to strach my eyes out... this movie was not enjoyed by the kids I saw it with...<br /><br />But, what I found mainly annoying about the movie was the horrible songs- all animate features have songs but, this one could have gone well without... the songs are horribly written and even veteren stage actor Albert Finney's voice seemed to be irritating. The songs in other words are just about as good as watching a Mary Kate & Ashley sing-along.<br /><br />This movie is hardly entertaining for the kids or the adults to see... In other words don't rent, don't buy this movie. Instead let this movie die a peaceful death like it should.</p></body></html>

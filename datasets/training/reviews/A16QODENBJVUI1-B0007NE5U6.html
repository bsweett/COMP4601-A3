<meta name="summary" content="A disappointing sequel to a delightful original"></head><body><p>The essential problem with the second Bridget Jones film is that the best parts remind the viewer of parts of the first film that were done a whole lot better.  It is a pleasant enough movie, but not so pleasant that I would recommend it over taking a risk on any other film or doing something safe like rewatching an episode of BUFFY.  I haven't read the book upon which the second film is based, so perhaps it is to blame for the relative blandness of the sequel, but something is to blame for the fact that while the original was charming and entertaining, the sequel feels tired and derivative.  But even if the book is to blame, it is incumbent upon anyone making a sequel to try to find some way of making the second film in some way new, instead of merely recycling the first.  In this regard, the movie fails.<br /><br />An additional problem I had with this movie is that it took some of the weaker aspects of the original even further than it had done.  For instance, one of the sources of the original was Bridget's penchant for making a bit of an ass out of herself.  Despite this, she constantly manages to come across as cute and adorable, but in the second film she merely looks ridiculous.  The first film presented Bridget as a sympathetic character, but she was much harder to love in the second.  Again, the fault may lie with the source material, but it is important for any filmmakers, when confronted with a weak source, to make it stronger in the rewrite.<br /><br />As with the original, Renee Zellweger is delightful as Bridget, and she remains the main reason for watching the film.  She is one of my favorite contemporary actresses, and someone who hasn't done the range of performances that I would have liked to see her take on.  I miss the days when she did small, independent films like THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD.  She looks a bit plumper in this one than in the original, and it is interesting that one of the more celebrated non-anorexic characters of reason years would be played twice by one of the thinnest actresses in the movies.  On the other hand, I didn't like either Colin Firth or Hugh Grant as much in this film as in the former.  The interesting thing about Mark Darcy (just as with his namesake from the BBC production of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE-not a slip on my part, because Ms Fielding acknowledges that the model for Darcy was Colin Firth's performance in the six-hour BBC production of the Jane Austen classic) in the first film was in gradually learning about his true feelings about Bridget.  There was no such mystery in this one.  Likewise, knowing from the original that Daniel Cleaver was a deceptive, manipulative creep made him a pretty uninteresting character in the sequel.  The guys too as good a job as is possible given the limited possibilities of character development, but their roles are too circumvented to allow of much interest.<br /><br />So, do I recommend this or not?  I really am on the fence.  I guess I'm glad I saw it, but if I hadn't I would have been able to preserve more fully my respect for the original.  Sequels can often mar excellent originals (think of the MATRIX movies), but still leave an overall surplus of enjoyment.  I guess I liked seeing this one OK, but I can't say now that I would have regretted never having seen it at all.  I suppose that there is no harm in seeing this one, but I would warn anyone who really liked (as I did) the original, that this one falls far short of that superb film.</p></body></html>

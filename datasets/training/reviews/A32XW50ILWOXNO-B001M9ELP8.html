<meta name="summary" content="Fists, blood and a Gato: The Rock's cooking worth smelling."></head><body><p>&quot;The Rundown&quot; is the latest entrant in the &quot;action musical&quot; category, a movie so entrenched in its belief of brawling that director Peter Berg occassionally stops the narrative to spin the Hawaiian jungle (filling in for the Amazon) in a tizzy and throw some bodies at each other. These fight scenes, most of them starring The Rock as a straight-arrow skip tracer, are at least devoted and energetic, more joyous than angry. It's jungle war, all right, but they're loving it. <p>The Rock is Beck, hired muscle for a loan shark looking to bring his son Travis (Seann William Scott) back from South America for reasons the movie never even cares to explain. Travis is a Stanford dropout and a treasure hunter; he is currently looking for a hidden, &quot;priceless&quot; aritifact called &quot;El Gato,&quot; which in Travis-speak translates to &quot;My Gato!&quot; As in &quot;You're not going to take me away from My Gato!&quot; This is before he's even found the Gato. <p>Travis seems to work for Hatcher (Christopher Walken) the Kurtz-like mayor of El Dorado, a gold-mining town. A barmaid (Rosario Dawson, on the 12th of her 15 minutes) has her own buried agenda. El Dorado is a mix of sadist soldiers (whips, chains, old Jeeps), kung-fu natives and a Scottish pilot (Ewen Bremner) given to drunken, biblical, incoherent stump speeches. &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; and &quot;Romancing The Stone&quot; are influences, as are any of the hard whiskey movies of William Friedkin and Sam Peckinpah. <p>Amidst this, The Rock brings a dash of Schwarzenegger with him, a detached, comical disbelief that, one, he's in movies to begin with; and two, that anybody inside the movie even bothers to mess with him. Scott still tries to channel Jim Carrey, but he's beginning to settle on becoming a more gifted version of Ashton Kutcher. Berg, praise be, shoots and lights the film without any artistic flourishes: There are no washed-out skies, no sepia jungles, no cool blue interiors, no high contrast. It's bright, lucid, crisp. Doesn't seem like much, but the natural scenery is its own character because of it. <p>&quot;The Rundown&quot; aspires to escapist, Saturday matinee entertainment. It succeeds, although Rock-ogling aside, women will likely want nothing to do with this movie.</p></body></html>

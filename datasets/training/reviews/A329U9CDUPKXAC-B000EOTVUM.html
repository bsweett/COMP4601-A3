<meta name="summary" content="Great horror"></head><body><p>This movie took way too long to get going. It didn't really seem to have a story until the crazy old dude entered in. But once that happens it's a good old fashion killing spree. The characters follow in horror movie tradition by doing the dumbest things possible like going back to the killer's house after they already escaped. They did that to get a car but instead take the time to look at photographs and watch movies. Oh, and venture down into a hole filled with dead bodies. It's so stupid but things like that have to happen. So I loved it.</p></body></html>

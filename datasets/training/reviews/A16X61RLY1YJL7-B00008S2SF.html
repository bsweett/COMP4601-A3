<meta name="summary" content="007 James Bond Die Another Day - Brosnan's best Bond yet!"></head><body><p>&quot;Die Another Day&quot; can certainly be said to be the best of the last four Bond films starring Pierce Brosnan.  The script is a very good one with clear starting points and carry through; the acting by all involved is a perfect match for the script and the overall feel of the movie harkens one back to the earlier days in the line of 007 James Bond movies where it's all about a big script and big action sequences that leave an audience stunned as James Bond does the impossible time after time and gets a babe or two in the process.<p>Performance wise, Pierce Brosnan is the perfect actor for James Bond and just as &quot;Die Another Day&quot; is the best of his first four Bond films; with this one he gives his best performance yet as Bond, James Bond.  Halle Berry's performance as Jinx, an NSA agent with the same goals as Mr. Bond is perfect.  At the time of this films theatrical release there were rumors about a spin off film with the character of Jinx and Halle Berry in the lead role, since that time &quot;I've&quot; heard little about it though.  John Cleese stepping in as Q is a good pick as well, replacing the dearly departed, lovable Desmond Llewelyn in that memorable role.  One of the best scenes in the film is John Cleese's scene as Q and seeing many of the props from earlier movies.  As usual, Judi Dench is perfect as M and ever so gorgeous Rosamund Pike's performance as Miranda Frost is quite memorable.<p>Lee Tamahori steps in as the director for this great Bond film and does a great job, his previous credits includes directing &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot; and episodes of &quot;The Sopranos.&quot;  Much of the credit for the success of this Bond film can most likely be attributed to his view on Bond and how he aptly displays this film.<p>The Premise:<p>As with all Bond films, &quot;Die Another Day&quot; starts off with a huge action sequence, setting up the rest of what the film is about.  James Bond infiltrates his way into North Korea, in certainly what can be described as a most unusual way.  He's there to assassinate a North Korean Army Colonel who's selling weapons on the black market.  His cover is blown and yet, through some pretty amazing action sequences, he seemingly accomplishes his mission.  In doing so though, he's captured by the North Korean Army and in particular, the father of the Colonel he's seemingly assassinated.  After spending several months in a North Korean prison being tortured, he's traded back to the British for a North Korean agent.<p>What follows from there is most certainly the most exciting Pierce Brosnan Bond movie yet!  I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of Bond movies or people who are fans good action/drama films!  No collection of James Bond DVD films is complete without this one!  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>Disc One<p>-Audio commentary with Director Lee Tamahori and Producer Michael G.

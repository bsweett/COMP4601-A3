A memory permantly ingrained as is this film. From the most amazing opening shot ever filmed this classic film never lets go of yor senses. It's fun, thrilling and holds up extremely well. Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer are exquisite. Sure some of the lyrics are corny and simple but it all works and I'm not even a fan of musicals.</p></body></html>

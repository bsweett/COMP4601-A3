<meta name="summary" content="Awful packaging! Awful packaging! AWFUL PACKAGING!"></head><body><p>I was so stoked for this DVD to come out.  One of the funnest movies Paul Verhoven ever made besides his work with Robocop.  So far, it's the only modern movie about Mars that has a decent story and has a great "realism" factor that still holds well after the credits have long since rolled.  I saw the extras listed on Amazon, I saw the illustration picture that showed the product but when I finally received it in the mail, low and behold-I get a round metal box thingy that holds the DVD.  The stupidity of this is that I have no place for this thing to go in my DVD library!  I have since learned that Artisan is releasing a version with a keepcase in the next few months which is the same thing they did with T2 (the original packaging couldn't hold both discs securly without that cheesy metal frame to go with it).  I am tired of this lame packaging Artisan is coming out with and from now on, I plan to buy DVD's at the lowest price from other retailers I know have a decent product I can actually look at before I buy!</p></body></html>

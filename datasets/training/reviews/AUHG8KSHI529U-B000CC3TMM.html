<meta name="summary" content="Pretty good successor to the first Transporter.  A couple of way over the top car scenes, though"></head><body><p>The important question is whether or not you liked the first "Transporter".  If you did, and can put up with a bit too much emphasis on the vehicles, you will probably like this movie.  It is light entertainment and has its own quirky style.  For me, Jason Statham has a just right approach to the very serious and obsessively precise man.  He is very skilled at violence, and so skilled that even while everyone is trying to kill him he does his level best to use the exact minimum level of violence to achieve his purposes.  Really, he would just rather be driving his perfectly detailed car with every detail of the trip executed perfectly - to at least two decimal places of precision.  If, like me, you find this idea a bit humorous and attractive, this movie is for you.<br /><br />Both of the movies played off providing a human interest for this lonely, solitary man.  In the first it was a romantic interest.  Here it is a more dangerous choice of a child.  Kids can make or break movies.  Here it is more the idea of the kid.  He is charming enough when he is on screen, but he really has a small part in the movie.<br /><br />The fight scenes play on the same types of kicks, spins, and gimmicks of the first movie, but does find fresh ways to use them including a pretty funny bit with a yacht in dry dock.  There are a few scenes that are just ridiculously over the top - you saw a couple of them in the trailers - I think one of the producers who popped for a bigger budget decided that the car was a star and wanted to do some uhmazzin things with it.  Really, the special driving in the chase scenes is enough.  We don't need to see the stupid car flying hundreds of feet from a skyscraper into an open floor across a wide street and land at an impossible angle.  Nor do we need to see the car roll and use a crane to just perfectly knock a bomb off the bottom of the car.  Oh, and just like you can't survive a falling elevator by jumping up, you can't survive a plane crashing into the ocean at 200 mph by throwing yourself towards the back of the plane.  Sheesh.<br /><br />Still, quite a bit of fun.  And I enjoyed the visiting French detective.  He added another nice touch.  It was also nice to see Matthew Modine on screen.  The villain was OK, but nothing really developed out of his early martial arts training scene.  Enjoy the movie.  Just don't think too hard.</p></body></html>

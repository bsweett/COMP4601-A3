<meta name="summary" content="Lost will make you loose your breath, yes it's that good"></head><body><p>Now that I finally got to experience "Lost" for myself I can certainly see what everyone around me is raving about. I didn't watch it when it came out because I'm not really a TV person and following shows is hard for me on weekly basis  so I decided to wait till few season finished to later watch them all in one swoop. For someone who doesn't watch the telly I plowed through this show ferociously and in six days was done with season one.<br /><br />First of all, I simply adore the lost in the woods and deserted island stories, books, films you name it. The drama that unfolds in this series has the same elements that can be found anywhere, rivalry, jealousy, hatred, love, false accusations, hidden secrets and all sorts of emotions take over characters as their time on the island seems to extend into eternity. The cast of characters is very broad but I adore how many main personalities there are because of the myriad of adventures that follow each and the groups they form themselves. One would think that staying calm and friendly would be one way to survive, but hunger, lack of protection from elements and the erratic ways the human behavior can change are no match for what really awaits for them on the island.<br /><br />The island they are stranded on is not your average lush tropical retreat. Not only is the island inhabited by strange creatures and monsters you don't really get to see at first but there is talk of others, dark beings that are either sinister people or something even worse. Best way to watch this is without knowing anything about it so I am not going to divulge any more details, let me just say that there are very few slow moments and most of the time things go from crazy to insane. My favorite characters so far are John Locke played by Terry O'Quinn  and Sayid  played by Naveen Andrews. One never knows if the characters are really pure at heart because there are so many wild twists but man this show rocks, I love it. The moment I finished watching season one I started with season two and few episodes into it I am just as enchanted as I was with the first. The revelations are incredible and the mysteries only seem to grow in size and danger. This is one show that I wish could go on forever, I hope there will be many more seasons to come.<br /><br />- Kasia S.</p></body></html>

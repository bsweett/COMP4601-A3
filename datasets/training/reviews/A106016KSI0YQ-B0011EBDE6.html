<meta name="summary" content="Every bit as annoying as you probably feared"></head><body><p>Wes Anderson intended this small comedy as a tribute to the great Indian film director Satyajit Ray, and it's as if he entirely missed the point of Ray's stately and subtle examinations of Indian life. Ray made everything small seem greatly more important by his careful attention to detail; Anderson here reduces just about everything into insignificance, including the entire nation of India itself, which is photographed stunningly but is treated in his screenplay as little more than merely a wacky backdrop for the screenplay's three annoying brothers, as if it were the Marx Brothers' Freedonia.<br /><br />The brotherly tensions don't seem much of an advance over the family depicted in THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS (again, the central family is rooted firmly in the leisured classes). But Anderson makes this even more tedious through his absolutely ghastly idea of making the eldest and dominant brother, Francis, an obsessive control freak, whose endless petty bullying we're supposed to find charming and adorable. (Even worse, he cast Owen Wilson in the part.) The film has a horrible case of the cutes, and it depends far too much upon images of the three brothers peering surreptitiously at one another and others through train windows. There are a few stunningly photographed sequences, but the whole thing feels far too much like hearing an annoyingly privileged and self-involved twentysomething hipster tell you at endless length about his awesome recent trip to find himself in India.</p></body></html>

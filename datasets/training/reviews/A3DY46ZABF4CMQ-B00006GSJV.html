<meta name="summary" content="Enter the Beautiful Mind of John Nash"></head><body><p>I have not seen this film until recently. I never really cared for this film nor for its leading star, Mr. Russell Crowe. But I happened to be in Blockbuster and I passed by this DVD so I picked it up only to quench my curiosity over why it was named Best Picture. I was amazed at how wonderful 'A Beautiful Mind' turned out. Of course, I liked Ron Howard's past movies 'Apollo 13', 'Backdraft', 'Gung Ho', 'Cocoon', 'Splash' and 'Nightshift', so my expectations were particularly high.<p>Russell Crowe amazed me as he delivered a very good performance as John Nash, a mentally disturbed mathematician genius at Princeton University. Jennifer Connelly reached her all time career peak as the woman Nash falls in love with and has to deal with her husbands problem. The movie is haunting, dark, funny at times, and very touching. I don't really know whether the movie dramatizes too much for movie purposes, but it sure unfolds very well. The makeup work is one of the highlights of the movie. Ed Harris is surprising in his role. <p>In no way is 'A Beautiful Mind' boring nor is it dumb. It sparks excellent performances and a beautiful character-actor picture.<p>Highly Recommended.<p>A</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The Sensational Spiderman..."></head><body><p>With the blockbuster success that accompanied "Spiderman", Sony Pictures wasted no time in getting Sam Raimi back behind the camera for the sequel.  With the majority of the original film's cast being signed for 3 movies (according to their contracts), odds were looking good that "Spiderman 2" could possibly surpass the original film, in terms of box office success, story, and quality.  Well, the results did not disappoint, "Spiderman 2" was a sensational success with audiences, critics, and the box office.<br /><br />"Spiderman 2" picks up sometime after the events of "Spiderman", as Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is trying to make his way through college, hold down a pizza delivery job, shoot photos for the Daily Bugle, visit his Aunt May and Mary Jane, all this while still being the hero Spiderman.  Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is now a Broadway star, and drops a `bombshell' on Peter, by announcing she is going to be married and that it's too late for Peter and her.  Peter's best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco), continues to blame Spiderman for the death of his father Norman, which is beginning to cause a rift in his friendship with Peter, due to Peter's constantly shooting pictures of the wall-crawler.  Friendship troubles aside Harry invites Peter to meet Dr. Otto Octavius, a scientist that has made revolutionary breakthroughs in the field of robotics for Oscorp.  When a mishap occurs during an experiment, even though Spiderman tried to stop the accident from occurring, Octavius' wife was killed and the semi-sentient robotic arms that Octavius had created were fused into his body.  The semi-sentient robotic arms are now slowly taking control of Octavius' mind causing him to go insane and lash out at those who have wronged him.  Now as the evil Dr. Octopus, his main focus is eliminating the one man he believes to be responsible for his current condition and his wife's death, Spiderman.<br /><br />The storytelling and the acting were so incredible and even more mature than expected, that the original film almost pales in comparison, and the original film was great.  "Spiderman 2" sets the bar even higher in terms of quality and craftsmanship, for future installments in this franchise, and other comic book movies in general.  This sequel is a definite must see for comic book fans and movie audiences in general, it contains a little something for everyone, from romance, to action, to comedy, "Spiderman 2" will not disappoint.  Highly recommended!<br /><br />"Spiderman 2" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Pretentious Pseudo-intellectualism"></head><body><p>This shallow film is but pretentious garbage for the new age crowd who think they've found a profound message in their little crystal beads and yoga books.  Although somewhat creative in terms of plot, the script and acting are about as shallow as the pompous message it seeks to propagate.<br /><br />The story follows two fallen angels played by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon who know a way to return to heaven without God knowing it; thereby proving Her imperfect and bringing an end to Her supposedly perfect creation. Yes, to keep up with modern liberal trends God decided to have a sex change operation for this movie.  A woman named Bethany (Linda Fiorentino) is called upon by two stoner prophets (Smith and Jason Mewes) to take her safely to her destination to stop God's errant angels.  The blunt messages passing off as subtly symbolic are laughable (i.e. the new Virgin Mary working in an abortion clinic.)  Wow! What creative powers of imagination!  Maybe they should have made their points more subtle such as Jay and Silent Bob using condoms for example or Chris Rock as the 13th apostle being not only married but polygamous.  Why not have the female God get a divorce while they're at it?  But since this screenplay is an attack on Christian hippocricy, why name Matt Damon's  hesitant protagonist character 'Loki' (a mischevious Nordic god having nothing to do with Christianity) while virtually every other character has a biblical name? To appear creative I suppose.  Perhaps the most irritating was Alanis Morissette as God: as if her singing isn't bad enough we have to watch her act too? Yes, of course! Let's have another retro-60s hippie high on acid passing as God to show how pious the tasteless fashions and mannerisms of that period were! C-o-o-o-l d-u-u-d-e! The fact that she was silent throughout was the one good thing about her acting in this film.  The only good performance in this film was by Alan Rickman as the voice of God but his role lasted only 10 minutes (fortunately for him as it avoided a lot of embarrassment.)<br /><br />I am agnostic and, quite frankly, I'd rather sit through 2 hours of Catholic mass than watch this phoney attempt at intellectualism and spiritualism.  Spare me! The people involved in this film have too little of an intellect to work on such grandiose themes: they need to stay with silly little things  worthy of their childish talents like 'Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' for example.  Avoid at all costs!</p></body></html>

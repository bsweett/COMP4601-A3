The visual effects, the acting, Bernard  Hermann's score, and the storyline are all great in this film. The only  problem with the film: it's kinda slow (not as slow as &quot;Psycho&quot;).  Other than this, I recommend this film to everyone. It is a piece of film  history not to be missed.</p></body></html>

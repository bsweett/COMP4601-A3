The amazing performance of Sean Penn as Milk, penetrating insights about his private existence, the edition work and the rhythmic vitality of the script ill engage you from start to finish. Special kudos go for Josh Brolin as Dan White in a role that might become his landmark reference for the rest of his lifetime.</p></body></html>

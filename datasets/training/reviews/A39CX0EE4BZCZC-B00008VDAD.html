<meta name="summary" content="Makes One Want To Study The Real Astronauts"></head><body><p>This was a very well-done true story of a space mission that came extremely close to being a disaster, but the astronauts miraculously made it home safely. It's good storytelling and so interesting that it led me  to study the real Apollo 13 astronauts.<br /><br />The movie is fairly long at 140 minutes and there is not much "action" but there is a lot of suspense and first-rating acting, both of which should keep anyone's interest. Knowing this was a true story makes one all the more involved with it.<br /><br />For such a tense story, with these astronauts lives on the line, none of the astronauts or people at NASA or anyone's family members are ever seeing praying throughout this ordeal! You can bet, in real life, a lot of prayers were answered on this mission.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Not a comedy, not a comedy, not a comedy"></head><body><p>The Break-Up, starring commedic actors Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston, was released in the summer of 2006 and came out on video that fall.  Advertising campaigns portrayed the movie as a romantic comedy, with Vince Vaughns character Gary possibly even being similar to the character he played in Wedding Crashers.  I remember when the movie came out, some reviews and maybe even some of the people involved with the movie said this isn't a romantic comedy but a realistic story about people breaking up.  I think anyone considering buying this movie should know what they are going to get:  This is not a comedy and it is not funny.<br /><br />The movie has a great cast, from Justin Long to John Favreau to Jason Bateman.  The character actors are funny and you could choose to laugh, but the entire movie is so depressing, the main characters so evil to each other, that nothing in the film is really ammusing.  Gary and Brooke meet in the opening scenes, the credits role and now they're living together and have their first, horrible vicious fight.  From then on, each person tries to make the other misirable.  This could have worked if there was just one reason to sense the two still like each other.  But they don't, and the movie never shows us why the ever did.  Gary seems like a jerk the entire movie.  Brooke isn't much better.  It seems the creators of this film knew what they were doing.  They made a film on the horrors and the evils that are part of the end of a relationship.  But that ruins the movie.  People see Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston on the cover and they expect a comedy.  Instead they see a movie about two people that are so hateful to each other that nothing good can possibly come out of their relationship.<br /><br />I can't recommend you get this movie unless you've seen it before and liked it or understand at least that this is not a romantic comedy.  There is no romance and almost nothing funny in the entire film.<br /><br />Many reviewers point out this isn't a comedy but rate it high for other reasons, such as the talented supporting cast.  I agree the cast is talented and some of their scenes are funny.  However, Gary and Brooke's fights cast such an overwhelming since of hatred and bitterness, that nothing else in the movie over comes it.  The acting is good, the entire concept of the movie is the problem.</p></body></html>

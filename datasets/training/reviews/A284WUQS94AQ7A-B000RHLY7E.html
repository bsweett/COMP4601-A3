Blackshere suggested this one to me.<br /><br />This movie is about a family that enjoys killing and are very sick and sadistic.  This film is technically good and the acting is not bad---pretty good for recent horror.  The opening scene is a shoot out with the cops and immediately grabbed my attention!  This sick family goes on to kill after some members escape the gun battle.  They run havoc on a little motel in the desert, hold hostages and torture them.  The "big daddy" of the group, Captain Spaulding (a clown), comes to his kids rescue to help carry out more murders.  A cop then seeks revenge on this group for killing his brother, the fun then begins.<br /><br />Gore?  This movie has it.  But I wouldn't call it scarey.  It is just a fun, entertaining movie about a very sick family.  The clown, Sid Haig is excellent in this and actually makes the film.  The plot was something less to be desired as it skips all over the place and doesn't always makes sense of what's happening.<br /><br />But, I have to admit, with all its flaws, I did enjoy this movie and it's always nice to see a well photgraphed horror movie.  Probably the better of recent horror.</p></body></html>

The filmmakers hit the 'Western' imagery right on the head. With vigilante justice and unlikely bonds, the stuff of old-time Westerns, the film comes alive as brothers seek revenge after the slaying of their mother. Plot twists and action will hold your attention. Some portions of the film are a bit unreal, but that's so in every Western I've ever seen. In the beginning, it's hard, as a viewer, to apply the 'Western' style to a hard urban community. For me, the relationships seemed a little awkward in this style. But the angle is a brave and successful move for the writers, director and producer. The acting is also superb. All four 'brothers' bring something special to the cinematic table.</p></body></html>

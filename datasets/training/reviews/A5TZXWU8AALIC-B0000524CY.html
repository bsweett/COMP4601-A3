<meta name="summary" content="STILL the greatest horror film ever made"></head><body><p>I prefer the 25th anniversary DVD of THE EXORCIST simply because it has much more stuff on it related to the film.<p>I saw this version in the theatres when it was released and still enjoyed it.  I thought the added images of the demon statues were distracting, but the 11 minutes of footage was interesting.<br />Remember when people smoked EVERYWHERE?  The hospital scenes where everyone, including the doctors, light up is almost funny now.<br />The &quot;spider walk&quot; scene, which I'd seen the rough footage for on the 25th DVD, still managed to make me jump when incorporated into the finished product this time around.<p>This is still the greatest horror film ever made.  God help us if they ever top this one.</p></body></html>

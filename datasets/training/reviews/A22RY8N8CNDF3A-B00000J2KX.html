When watching this, you need to remember Stanley Kubrick is the director and he tends to have a lot of "white space" or time for artful like scenery.  Much of the first part of the movie has scenes of long winding roads, driving miles and miles up a mountain to a beautiful hotel.  There are also scenes of a young boy riding a three-wheel trike through long halls and empty rooms of the hotel.  A garden maze is also featured with tall green bushes cut in at least an acre of ground that the young boy and his mother navigate as the main character seems to watch above a model inside the hotel.<br /><br />At the beginning, after a three hour drive for a job interview, most of it up the sinuous mountain road,  an aspiring novelist, Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) has an interview for an off-season job at a enormous Chalet-Type Hotel isolated in the Colorado mountains.  Jack, his wife (Shelly Duvall) and his young son (Danny Lloyd) move in for the five winter months, with the agreement to maintain the elegant hotel.  They will be isolated as the road to the mountain top is not cleared during the heavy winter storms.  Jack is told of the scary history of the hotel, which included murders by another custodian that they feared got "cabin fever" from being alone so long.  Jack laughs off the possibility he will get cabin fever, he just wants to be alone to write, and this job fits his needs perfectly.<br /><br />Sinister powers begin to seep through the hotel and then flood it with chilling horror.  With remarkable visual panache and a keen sense of irony, Stanley Kubrick rehabilitates Stephen King's trashy, terrifying novel.</p></body></html>

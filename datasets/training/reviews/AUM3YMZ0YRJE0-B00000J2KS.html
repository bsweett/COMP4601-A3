<meta name="summary" content="absolutely first rate scifi"></head><body><p>I had not seen this movie in ten years, so I bought it for my collection of quirky scifi.  I popped it in my DVD player and was as utterly spellbound by it as I was the first time in I saw it, nearly 30 years ago, but from a new and different point of view (of a middle-aged man).<br /><br />It is simply one of the greatest socio-scifi films ever made, rich in themes and unforgettable images, a language uniquely its own, with first-rate acting and innumerable layers.  There are deliciously unanswered questions in it, like the infiltration of Russian into working class British slang, that stimulate the imagination.  In my humble opinion, this marks it as a work of genius that will survive as a classic of our times, to be compared with the greatest literary accomplishments.  Kubrick is one of the all-time greats and this film is superior to the novel by Burgess.<br /><br />We witness Alex, a twisted and sadistic youth, on his private journey to hell.  While devilishly funny, it is also a frightening portrait of a decadent industrial society, in which politicians and the intelligensia are as brutal as the thugs they hire into the police.  Plus, you have Kubrick's fascination with music and altered states of consciousness, all of which form part of Alex's bizarre character and recondite violence.  The story is so unique!!  And constantly stimulating.<br /><br />Recommmended as great art that will grow in your imagination for the rest of your life.</p></body></html>

Eastwood does a good job with what it is basically a faithful retelling of the book.  Unfortunately, probably out of necessity, the novel's depths are often given a shorthand treatment that relies a great deal on its actors.  And for the most part this works.  Penn as Jimmy is terrific.  Anguished and angry, his intensity simply jumps off the screen.  He deserved the Oscar.  But just as good is Tim Robbins, as the damaged Davey.  To some extent his role is the more difficult one.  Sexually abused as a child, a middle aged failure who has nevertheless succeeded at being a good father and husband despite the psychological black hole he carries around with him.  Bacon, less so as Sean.  But his character in the novel is similarly hard to grasp, probably because he is not so locked into fate.  To some extent he has escaped, but he has his own problems even if he has moved on to a better life (if being a detective so qualifies).  On film this plays strangely, and Sean's estranged relationship with his wife, explained in the book, can only draw a "What?" from the viewer who has not read the novel.  All the supporting cast give superb efforts, contributing to the movie's long bass note of sadness and tragedy.  Still, this is a three star effort, mainly because the stakes are higher.  Lehane's novel is essentially Greek Tragedy with a Boston setting.  Perhaps Eastwood's chief error is not spending an extra ten minutes or so developing the three "friends" personalities when they were children.  Lehane provides considerable layering at the start of his novel, showing the tensions that exist between the boys (and their families), and how these tensions are fueled by the economic and social status each is born in to.  In many ways, the neighborhood, as Lehane portrays it,  is an oppressive hell hard to escape. Like the sins of our fathers, it is a millstone that is inherited.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Kung Fu Panda vs. Wall-E"></head><body><p>So who would win in a fight? Kung Fu Panda (Po) or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EOQWFI">Wall-E</a>? Which movie is better? Let's break it down in pro boxing's real world 8-point-must system.<br /><br />The fight for the better movie (6 Rounds):<br /><br />Wall-E story: 10<br />Kung Fu Panda story: 9<br /><br />Wall-E voice acting talent: 8<br />Kung Fu Panda voice acting talent: 10<br /><br />Wall-E action: 9<br />Kung Fu Panda action: 10<br /><br />Wall-E family fun factor: 9<br />Kung Fu Panda family fun factor: 10<br /><br />Wall-E "I wanna see it again" factor: 9<br />Kung Fu Panda "I wanna see it again" factor: 10<br /><br />Wall-E DVD extras: 9<br />Kung Fu Panda DVD extras: 10<br /><br />Unanimous decision: Wall-E 54  Kung Fu Panda 59<br />Better Movie: Kung Fu Panda<br /><br />Now if Wall-E and Po had to fight for the title, it would probably go something like this:<br /><br />Po comes right out swinging and kicking. Wall-E immediately looks broken. Po belly-slams Wall-E and one of Wall-E's eye-lenses pops loose. Po closes in on Wall-E for the Wuxi Finger Hold, but before Po can say "skadoosh", Wall-E activates his welding laser and makes Panda steaks out of Po.<br /><br />Winner by KO: Wall-E<br /><br />Both movies are worth your time. Check 'em out.</p></body></html>

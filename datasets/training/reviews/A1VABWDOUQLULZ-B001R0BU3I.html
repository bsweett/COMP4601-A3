The title gives away nothing, as you spend the entire plot attempting to understand who is traitor to what, to whom.  It is assumed that Horn is a traitor to his faith, though nothing is as it seems.  While action and drama is the primary focus, the audience is given a crash course in the realities of terrorism, and the bigotries and hypocrisies that come with it.  The film is still entertaining despite its intense unraveling of post 9/11 moral ambiguity.</p></body></html>

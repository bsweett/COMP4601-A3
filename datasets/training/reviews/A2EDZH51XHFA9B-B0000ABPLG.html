In this one, John Preston (Christian Bale) is a member of the Tetragrammaton, a sort of secret police-style organization dedicated to the stamping out of anything in society that causes people to feel emotion (in the opening scene, for example, Preston and crew destroy the Mona Lisa). Preston and his partner Partridge (The Dark's Sean Bean) are Clerics, members of the inner Tetragrammaton circle, and rigorously screened to be above suspicion; Preston, however, discovers that Partridge has kept back a piece of contraband from a recent raid, a book of Yeats' poetry. Preston is forced to execute Partridge, and soon gets his new partner, Brandt (Taye Diggs), who may be even more fanatical than Preston. Preston, though, has his own secret: he's stopped taking the drug that blocks emotion, the drug that the entire society takes. And maybe emotions aren't quite as awful as he's always thought...<br /><br />The thing that stands out about Equilibrium at first glance is the cast, which contains a stable of incredible B-list stars--Bale, Bean, Diggs, Emily Watson, William Fichtner, Dominic Purcell, Sean Pertwee, John Keogh, Angus McFadyen, and more. Which is good, because Kurt Wimmer, writer of such classic film adaptations as Sphere and The Thomas Crown Affair and director of the immortal Milla Jovovich film Ultraviolet (just in case you didn't catch it, the first half of this sentence is rather heavy with sarcasm), is neither a good enough writer nor a good enough director to make this into the truly excellent movie it could have been. The strength of the cast saves it from being as horrible as The Matrix, but it does rely far too heavily on staged action sequences. There is a surprising amount of character development here, and it's very nicely acted, though it'd be nice if it were better-paced or had a slightly stronger plot to hang on. Instead, we get a lot of sound and fury, signifying, well, maybe more than it should. ** ?</p></body></html>

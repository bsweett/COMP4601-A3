<meta name="summary" content="Beautiful, epic, and heartbreaking all in one."></head><body><p>Combining two genres that previously, I never thought of blending, socially-consciens and alien lifeforms, "District 9" brilliantly brings to life a gripping tale that is very realistic, but also heartbreaking all in one.<br /><br /> Featuring relatively unknown actors, "District 9" takes place in Johannesburgh, South Africa, where the legacy of Apartheid lingers on across every sector of the nation's societies, regardless of wealth or race. A large alien spacecraft parks itself above the city's skyline, and hovers over the place for many years, doing virtually nothing. To the dismay, amazement but also fear of the citizenry, a large colony of alien lifeforms, who exhibit sentience, find themselves stranded on Earth.<br /><br /> Due to fear gripping the city, the alien lifeforms are herded into slum villages with one becoming known as District 9.<br /><br /> This is a marvelous movie and one I highly recommend.</p></body></html>

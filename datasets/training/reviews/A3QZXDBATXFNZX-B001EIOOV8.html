<meta name="summary" content="The Best Mob Movie Of All Time"></head><body><p>This is by far one of Martin scorsese's best film's and always will be. Robert Richerdson's Photography is brillent and the performances are wonderful from the whole cast. The DVD is ok it has good picture and sound thats about it. But the violence is extremely graphic and I am surprized that it didnt get The NC-17 rating. But its still a very brillent picture. <p>Warning: This film contains Extremely Graphic Prolonged Brutal Violence including Strong language,Strong Drug Use,and some strong sexuality. You Have Been Warned About The Violence In The Film.</p></body></html>

These doubts were only reinforced by some fairly negative responses in this part of the world. Not to mention the fact that the movie had some big shoes to fill following on from the movies with Christopher Reeve.<br /><br />As already mentioned, some of the events are borrowed heavily from the previous Superman movies. Of particular note is the scene where Lane and Superman fly together, the crashing of Superman to earth at the beginning and a few other points. However, enough was original to keep it from being purely a re-run. Luthor getting out of prison because the prosecution's prime witness had legged it, (or rather flew the coop), was a nice touch.<br /><br />The computer graphics are probably what stands out, and their quality is fairly good. The special effects are excellent, though you can still tell the CGI when you see it. It is detailed and very well done. Superman's flight sequences are particularly good.<br /><br />The movie has a good pace to it, and it will not leave you looking at the watch. It has a good story line, with Luthor finding out about Krypton and all their technology. I have to admit, Kevin Spacey makes a good Lex Luthor.<br /><br />Overall, I liked this movie. I would not say that it left me breathless, but there is something about Superman that always wins the day. It was a good reprise of the character and a good night's entertainment. However, see it again? I do not think so.</p></body></html>

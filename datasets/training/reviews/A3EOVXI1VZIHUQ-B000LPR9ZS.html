The traps are gorier and harder, while we find that we don't care all that much about the characters themselves. The acting is still good, but the story doesn't seem to meet the muster of the first sequel.<br /><br />The unresolved surprise ending involving Detective Matthews in Saw II is dealt with thoroughly here and answers many questions. But Saw III involves a new cast of characters to be tested by Jigsaw's games. Along with his sidekick Amanda, Jigsaw has kidnapped a female doctor and hooked his life support system to a device around her neck that will fire six rounds into her head if his heartbeat ever stops. Meanwhile a man whose son was a victim of a hit and run is forced to walk through rooms where each person who took part in that incident is being tortured in front of him.<br /><br />As the film goes on, the suspense seems to be dropping as the audience wonders why they should care about any of this. And although Jigsaw and Amanda provide a formidable evil duo, the momentum begins to drop due to an excess of gore and a cacophany of screams.<br /><br />In the end, though, it all pays off, and although the film itself doesn't live up to the original sequel, it's still much more interesting and mind-bending than most other horror films of this time. For a 3rd installment in a franchise, Saw III is a top-quality movie. The twists and the twisted nature of the film will leave fans eager for a fourth.</p></body></html>

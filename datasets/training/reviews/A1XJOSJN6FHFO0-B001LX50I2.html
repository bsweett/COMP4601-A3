<meta name="summary" content="Creepy!"></head><body><p>I just got up from watching this movie and I have to say it certainly was strange and intense to say the lease.  We are faced with a seriel killer, who kills entire families and is dubbed as the "Tooth Fairy Killer."<br /><br />Our young detective Will is faced with a true challenge and a race with the clock to figure out what makes this killer tick, protect his family and stop this madman.  He enlists the help of none other than Lector, the feared killer that we all know from "Silence of the Lambs," who is now safely locked behind glass but who still seems to be able to influence the bizzard killings and the killer.  Always creepy.....when he is encountered. Always a game with the mind.<br /><br />We are taken to the past of our killer and find abuse which seems to have played a large role in who he is and what he is trying to become. We have a glimpse into his twisted mind as the storyline is played out and  wonder how many of these types of people are out there now. Very unsettling.<br /><br />A good movie, great characters and good storyline. If you are into movies about seriel killers this one should do quite well.</p></body></html>

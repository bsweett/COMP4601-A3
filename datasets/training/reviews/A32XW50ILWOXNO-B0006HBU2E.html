<meta name="summary" content="Chases and chess matches: a spy series for smart people."></head><body><p>Cool, confident, professional, &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; cements the franchise as the intellectual alternative to the now goofy, effects-dripping James Bond series. Immersed in the spy world without posting blinking signs to the genre - minimum gadgetry - the movie is a brisk, excellent global tour of international politics.<br /><br /> In Matt Damon, the series, mined from Robert Ludlum's novels, has a man of everyday, blockheaded features capable of physical extremes; this is not Tom Cruise tossing back his hair, suspended in vanity from a rock. There is moment when Jason Bourne, in mourning, looks pinched and ugly, an excellent capture of sadness. Bourne barely breathes in this movie, and he doesn't speak much more. Waste in not in his vocab, nor the film's.<br /><br /> Still haunted by memories of the mission that helped trigger his amnesia in &quot;Identity,&quot; the first film, Bourne has found a ocean hideout in Goa, India with girlfriend Marie (Franka Potente). Across the world, in Berlin, Bourne is being framed for two murders in a CIA sting gone bad. Soon after, a Russian assassin (Karl Urban, excellent if virtually silent) is after Bourne and Marie, who is killed after a car accident on a bridge. Bourne is then onto Naples, Italy, where he must reenter the CIA grid as deputy directors Pamela Lundy (Joan Allen) and Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) wait to descend. Both want Bourne. Lundy prefers him alive; Abbott pushes for death. Bourne seeks his framers and the source of his dreams. It leads to Room 645 in a Berlin hotel.<br /><br /> As a young colleague (Julia Stiles, in garish highlights) puts it, Bourne doesn't make mistakes, he makes moves, drawing the crosshairs closer, the better to learn his captors motives. He lands in three major jams, the last pitting him against that Russian assassin, every bit Bourne's equal, in a Moscow tunnel. Staged by director Paul Greengrass, these public chases are feats of speed and editing, daring enough to admire Bourne's considerable spy skills while still this side of believable - Damon sustains a limp after landing hard on a barge. As in the first movie, boxy European four-doors are the vehicles of choice as Bourne evades his captors - slow, yet seeming to endure almost endless structual damage, they are mechanical companions to Bourne. Functional, indestructible.<br /><br /> Joan Allen, glaring soft like steel wool, is perfectly cast as CIA ice queen Lundy - by-the-book and clever, but not Jason Bourne clever. But Cox, as Abbott, is hamstrung by the red arrow pointing at his character. Tony Gilroy returns for the screenplay, and it is again literate, hushed and direct, proving that stories absent of joy - gray skies abound, and Moscow simply doesn't play host to happiness - still entertain through the force of their intelligent gambits. Whereas the Jack Ryan series got caught up with the pedestrian manliness of Harrison Ford, &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; is content to keep working the angles, the reward being a night of sleep, or a simple, overdue apology. It's spy food for those with perspective.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="3rd Movie, 3 Villains, Is It For Better Or Worse?"></head><body><p>I could already feel where Spider-Man 3 could have had problems before even seeing the movie. Too many characters, not enough character development, too long, you know something along those lines. Although 3 villains may seem like too many it didn't feel overcrowded. In this third segment Peter Parker deals with so much but don't fear because spidey appears or does Venom. In the beginning it's all about Peter Parker and how big his ego is getting.<br /><br />Everybody loves Spider-Man; he took care of his school and work problems, and best of all he has Mary Jane. What more could Peter ask for but during his short period of joy three things are in the process of attempting to destroy Spider-Man. The first is of course the New Goblin (Harry Osborn) who wants revenge for what Spider-Man did to his Father. The second being Flint Marko who just escaped from prison and eventually becomes the Sandman. Parker's third problem is that Venom just landed on earth and is looking for a host preferably a Spider-Man.<br /><br />A huge series of events occurs after these three including one at the end that is hard to believe but will excite many. After thinking about how the film began and ended I understand how some people feel. I think that Spider-Man 3 is an amazing movie but it will create problems for the Spider-Man films to come, that's if there will even be future films. So much drama is added to all these films because of Mary Jane and I imagine that her damsel in distress act will get old quick. Without her these films don't have much of a story or a heart, they wouldn't be able to have a deep story. They need something else other than Mary Jane, how long will she hold up because she is and will always be the target but that is his one weakness so I guess it's cool for now.<br /><br /> Good bad villains were used in this especially the popular venom. I can only imagine that should there be a 4rth film that Carnage is next up to fight. The films pacing was pretty good, good suspense and great action, this may have been the most exciting of the three. The cinematography was great, acting was good, and the fight sequences were on point. The biggest problem with Spider-Man 3 has to be that the usage of the villains went a little wrong but because these characters are not exactly human there is so much that can be done with them in the future. Where do you think Carnage comes from? There would be no him without Venom. Spider-Man 3 is a great film that will be enjoyed by the average moviegoer. Comic fans may get a tad bit irritated but hey you can't expect them to keep everything the same.</p></body></html>

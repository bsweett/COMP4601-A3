<meta name="summary" content="RIDDICK RETURNS BETTER THAN BEFORE!!!"></head><body><p>it's hard for a sequal to get anywhere near as good as the first one, or in some cases surpass it as well. well this one almost did for me. pitch black and the chronicles of riddick are both so different, but are still along the same lines. the chronicles was very good, i didn't think it was going to be such a big deal, but i'm glad i was wrong. vin diesel, does what he does best. the big action hero, with an "i don't care about anybody but myself" attitude returns for some more. he's a great actor, and these are the kinds of movies he should do, because all eyes are on him the whole time. the follow up story was good as well. a few years later he's back and only he can save the world. he meets up with an old friend, and together they must beat this leader of the half dead necromongers. he finds love, but at what a cost. in the end good must prevail over evil. great movie, fantastic scenes, and riddick does it again. i want more.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Serviceably Entertaining"></head><body><p>Director Gavin Hood pulls together an enjoyable, if not especially profound, survey of the most popular X-Man's missing years.  Moving mainly in fits and starts through most of two centuries, it shows how a sickly young boy becomes an angry fighter, shrugs off mortal wounds, and loses interest in being alive.  And then, at the last moment, he rediscovers what he believes in--and it costs him everything.<br /><br />Hood teases out little hints dropped in the prior movies, turning disconnected images into a coherent narrative.  Though nothing particularly surprising or revelatory takes place, the film at least acquits itself with a number of good set pieces, a realistic science fiction conflict and rationally motivated characters.  It does a good job setting up where Wolverine came from, and opening doors for where he might go.<br /><br />And the acting is strong.  Hugh Jackman proves once again that he's able to carry off an action hero who suffers the full range of human emotions.  Danny Huston's Colonel Stryker is smart but in love with his own intelligence.  And who knew brainy Liev Schreiber could hulk out and play such a powerful villain?  If there's a real shock in this film, it's a  previously unseen side of Schreiber.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is good.  While it lacks the moving intensity of the first two X-Men movies, it entertains and engages, pulling viewers through a story that keeps us hooked as we wait to see secrets revealed.  X-Men fans and action movie devotees will find plenty to like in this fun, muscular film.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A movie that haunts your dreams."></head><body><p>There are greater film noirs than "Laura"--"Double Indemnity" and "Out of the Past" immediately come to mind--but its sheer, silky elegance and insinuating malevolence, backed by David Raksin's hauntng theme music, cast a spell over viewers that is rare in any film genre. Otto Preminger never again matched his achievement here, as he tells Vera Caspary's tale of wealthy, decadent New Yorkers suspected of murdering a beautiful young socialite. There are so many glorious things about this movie that it's hard to enumerate them all in a capsule review, but surely one must start with the actors. Gene Tierney, her heartbreaking beauty matched by her air of innocent, straightforward gentility, achieved screen immortality with this one role, and deserved to. Dana Andrews, as the tough, wily police detective who falls for her, finds just the right blend of cynicism and moral clarity, all the better to outfox the hothouse egoism of the suspects. As Tierney's aunt and fiance, Judith Anderson and Vincent Price are a match made in Hell--charming, weak, and utterly treacherous. But the standout is Clifton Webb, lean and sharp as a rapier, making his film debut at 55 after a lifetime on the Broadway stage. As the acidulous radio personality Waldo Lydecker (think Alexander Woollcott meets Captain Hook), Webb pours venom into every scene he's in and makes us lap it up. (A sample line: "I should be sincerely sorry if my neighbors' children were devoured by wolves.") The wolves in "Laura" are not in sheep's clothing, but in evening dress, and to watch Andrews outsmart them is cinematic pleasure of a very high order indeed. The print on the current DVD release is quite good, and the extras include two interesting "A&E Biography" episodes: one about the sad life of Gene Tierney, blighted by mental illness and family tragedy, and one about the considerably happier, healthier life of Vincent Price, a bon vivant in the best sense of the term.</p></body></html>

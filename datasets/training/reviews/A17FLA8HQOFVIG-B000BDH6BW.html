<meta name="summary" content="I laughed out loud when I should have been serious.  Outlandish and silly."></head><body><p>In this 2005 film directed by John Singleton, four adopted brothers in inner city Detroit reunite at their mother's funeral.  She has just been murdered and they are out for revenge. It sounds like a good theme and there's some star power here too as Mark Wahlberg plays the lead and Terrance Howard has a small part as a cop.  But the screenplay was so outlandish that there were parts that I laughed out loud when I should have been serious.  Everyone has guns, lots of guns, and there are wild shootouts with bodies strewn all over the place.  To their credit, the actors do a good job.  Their performances were good although it was hard to pay attention to their acting with all that gunfire going on.  The plot was disjointed and murky and made no sense whatsoever.  It was easy, however, to tell the good guys from the bad guys because the bad guys always had smirks on their faces.  This is a silly silly film which is targeted towards pre-adolescent boys who are more interested in the gunplay than the reality of the plot.<br /><br />Keep away from this one.  It is a waste of time and not for adults.</p></body></html>

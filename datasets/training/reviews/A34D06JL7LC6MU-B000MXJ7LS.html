<meta name="summary" content="An Important Film"></head><body><p>"World Trade Center" is the 2nd film released in 2006 to dramatize the events that transpired on September 11, 2001 (one of the most tragic days in United States history). Released a few months after the harrowing, depressing "United 93" this film also tells the story of normal, everyday people trapped in horrific circumstances with heroic outcomes. Although the outcome of this film is admittedly better than that of "United 93." The film is directed by Oliver Stone, a director who is no stranger to controversy. When I heard he was doing a film on the subject of 9/11, I expected a film in the vein of "JFK" or "Nixon"<br /><br />or "The Doors." True stories, with his own theories and versions of events. Watching "World Trade Center" there is little evidence to suggest that this is an Oliver Stone film. The directing style is different, the storytelling is different. Only one scene seems like something out of an Oliver Stone film (Jesus with a water bottle) and I read that Will Jimeno actually saw that. The movie starts at 3:29 A.M. in New York, as Port Authority officer John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) wakes up to head to work. Stone does a great job of underlining how normal the day was for New Yorkers before the first plane hit the first tower. The imagery of the plane's shadow and the smoke from the towers is very haunting and very realistic. Knowing what we now know, it's interesting hearing the characters trying to figure out what's going on. Anyway, after the second plane has hit the second tower (although most people weren't yet aware of that), McLoughlin and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena from "Crash" who deserves an Oscar nomination for his work here), along with others, rush into the WTC to help the people still inside. Barely inside the towers collapse, leaving McLoughlin and Jimeno trapped under 20 feet of rubble. The two men trapped under the rubble, trying desperately to keep their minds off death is intercut with the lives of their wives. Donna McLoughlin (Maria Bello, who also deserves an Oscar nomination) fights desperately against the fact that her husband might be dead, while trying to convince her children that, without a doubt, their father is still alive. Meanwhile Allison Jimeno (Maggie Gyllenhaal, who also deserves an Oscar nomination), who is pregnant with the couples second child, deals with the fact that her husband might not be coming home. Out of the two female leads, Bello is the best. Wearing blue contact lenses to make her character more realistic, she blends just the right amount of integrity, bravery, and attitude to make this one of the best performances of the year. One other subplot involves a former U.S. Marine named Dave Karnes (Michael Shannon), a man who leaves his job and goes searching for survivors in the rubble. While "United 93" used harsh realism and left you feeling depressed, "World Trade Center" uses harsh realism and makes you feel uplifted. A film about people trapped in places can feel disjointed, as if the screenwriter lost his way and made excuses to get his script into the 120-page range (this can be seen in a film called "Hard Candy," which is good but has what I just mentioned). This film has the feel of a movie that knew exactly what direction it's taking from the beginning. "World Trade Center" is an important film, a great film, and a massive improvement over Stone's last film "Alexander." It's got great cinematography, great performances, and is, without a doubt, one of the best films of the year.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></body></html>

Ok, the cold war is over, most of it. Arms races are temporarily on hold, until further notice (after all, the opponents of deficit spending will never oppose a proper military budget, will they). But: just listen to insane General Jack D. Ripper's conspiracy theory about fluoride additives, or to General Turgidson's ravings about armament gaps in comparison to the Commies, and you will rather easily recognize their various contemporary brothers in arms. Either of them would stand a chance to win the reptiliannomination.<br /><br />By the way, there is a frequent misconception that Peter Sellers plays the madman in this film. Not so. Sellers plays some of the rational people here (the RAF officer who tries to stop the Ripper, and the President). He also plays the clown, Strangelove, Merkwuerdigliebe, an amalgam of all hijacked Nazi scientists. He is just crazy. Harmless.<br />Brilliant acting by Sellers in his 3 parts, and by George C.Scott as Turgidson (who is said to have been unhappy with his character.)<br />Worth a repeat visit.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Finally, someone gets it right"></head><body><p>Superhero movies are a mixed bag. Sometimes you get a good one that captures the heart of what made the comic book popular (Spider-Man, Batman Begins), and sometimes they just go all weird for no reason (Superman Returns, The Hulk). "Iron Man" has captured that perfect feel for a comic book movie.<br /><br />First, we go to a movie called "Iron Man" to SEE Iron Man, and director Favreau doesn't disappoint. We see him four times in the three different incarnations (original, plain iron, and the gold-and-red). The sequences are action-packed and perfect.<br /><br />Second, Robert Downey Jr. is dead-on as Tony Stark. He has this smirky personality yet he manages to stay down to earth at the same time. You actually feel for this character and laugh in the moments he's creating the armor (the jet boot sequences are hilarious).<br /><br />Finally, the storyline itself. It's a perfect origin story that remains true to the comics while still giving us something new. You can tell Jon has had a lot of time with the comics by giving little nods to the real comic book fans out there (wondering about War Machine? There's a hint in the movie).<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest and greatest fanboy moment of all comes after the credits have finished rolling. You've got to sit through a LOT of them, but trust me: DON'T MOVE! The final one minute sequence sets the stage perfectly for where Jon wants to take the movies in the future.<br /><br />I loved this film. I can't recommend it highly enough. I just hope they allow Jon to direct the next two AND the Avengers movie (if it ever comes out). Just like Sam Raimi captured the essence of Spider-Man in the first movie, Jon has Iron Man down pat.</p></body></html>

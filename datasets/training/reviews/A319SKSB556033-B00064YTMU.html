<meta name="summary" content="Worst assassin in history!"></head><body><p>I recently played the game Hitman 2: Silent Assassin on my Gamecube. The title really says it all: SILENT Assassin. Yes? However I didn't particularly find it much fun with all that stealth and creeping around. I just went in guns blazing. I was crap. But I wasn't as bad as Vincent in this movie.<br /><br />Tom Cruise plays Vincent (ooh ahh, Tom is playing a bad guy, hype, hype, hype) a thoroughly conspicuous looking character who is in LA for a spot of contract killing. He hires unhappy cabbie Max (Jamie Foxx) for the whole night. Five stops, five kills, yadda yadda yadda...you've seen the trailer.<br /><br />This arrangement might have worked if Vincent were competent in the least. But he's just terrible. He leaves evidence everywhere, makes moronic mistakes, walks in front of every CCTV camera in LA and blabs far too much to Max, who any half-competent assassin would off at the end of the night anyway. Whatever the bad guys are paying him, the paycheck far exceeds the skill.<br /><br />Michael Mann directs the film with amazing skill, brilliantly capturing the multiple looks and feelings of night-time LA. There are many scenes of tangible atmosphere in Collateral, so much so that the film is eerily calming. A very slickly crafted film, but not as memorable as previous films in Mann's career.<br /><br />Cruise and Foxx have great chemistry together though it must be said that Foxx comes off as the better performer/character. Neither of them overact and keep their cool but there's a true realistic edge to his lonely cabbie than Cruise's idiot assassin who leaves incriminating exhibits A-Z all over LA.<br /><br />The DVD is in gorgeous looking 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen with colors so vivid and lifelike you'll forget your watching a movie and not real life. The Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is also stunning, fully complimenting the movie's dynamic sound design. Gunshots are very loud and pack a heavy punch, if you have a home theatre you'll love it. James Newton Howard's atmospheric score is also seamlessly woven into the film's sound design and it's surely Howard at the top of his game, miraculously blending his own score with non-original tracks. Once again, if you have a home theatre you'll LOVE the Fever Club scene.</p></body></html>

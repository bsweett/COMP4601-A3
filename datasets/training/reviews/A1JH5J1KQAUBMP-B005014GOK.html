<meta name="summary" content="Machete kills!"></head><body><p>After his family is murdered by a powerful drug lord (Steven Seagal), ex-Federale Machete (Danny Trejo) becomes a day laborer in the States until he is pulled into an underhanded plot to guarantee the election of an anti-immigration right winger (Robert DeNiro) to the Senate.  Much bleeding and nudity ensues.<br /><br />Writer/director Robert Rodriguez shares his colleague Quentin Tarantino's fascination with the exploitation cinema of the 70s, but Rodriguez has a purer vision.  He may not elevate his material with frequently inspired dialogue, but he also does not distract from his story with awkward, self-indulgent homages.  Rodriquez delivers a fast, entertaining, fun movie that one could imagine seeing in a grindhouse theater.  Trejo is the Mexican Charles Bronson that we didn't know we were waiting for.  It's a shame the guy is already 66 (!), because I'd like to see him crank out one or two hard and dirty thrillers a year for the next 20 years.  Even if I didn't see them, it would be nice just to know they were out there.  Seagal and DeNiro have a lot of fun with their roles.</p></body></html>

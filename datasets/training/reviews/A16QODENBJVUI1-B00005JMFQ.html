This is a big, stuffed-to-the-gills film, presumably with something to entertain every viewer, but also something for anyone to criticize if they so wish.  I did not so wish, simply because most of it was fun, nearly all of it was funny, and as a whole it is a very good time.<p>Some seem to be criticizing the film for not having more Hugh Grant or other actors, but that completely misunderstands what the film is.  It is not a star vehicle, a la MAID IN MANHATTAN or TWO WEEKS NOTICE from the last Holiday season, but an ensemble piece.  In other words, there is a large cast of actors, and the film tries to balance a number of stories instead of focusing merely on one.  More than that, it is not an ensemble film in the sense of GOSFORD PARK, which uses a group of actors to tell essentially one story.  This film uses its ensemble to tell a number of stories, stories that manage to overlap to a degree, but separate stories nonetheless.<p>Telling several stories at once, some are going to work better than others.  The worst, by far, was the Laura Linney story, in which an American is prevented from a romance with a man to whom she is enormously attracted by her willingness to accept at all times of the day and night calls from her mentally ill brother.  Anyone who knows anything about having a relative who is mentally ill knows that the first rule is setting limits to their behavior, so that it doesn't control the behavior of those around them.  No mental health professional in the world would have allowed the brother to call his sister at will.  But that was the only one of the tales that I found to be absurd.  Most of the others were delightful.<p>My favorite performer was without question Bill Nighy, who stole nearly every scene he appeared in, playing an aging rocker who is trying to get back in the public eye by singing a god awful updating of the Troggs's classic &quot;Love is All Around&quot; to &quot;Christmas is All Around.&quot;  He takes the entire thing as one huge joke, and his joking nearly steals the film.  <p>At a time when the American presidency is held in greater disdain in the world in general and in England in particular, there is a particular interesting bit of fantasy in which the British Prime Minister, played by Hugh Grant, stands up in a press conference to the American President, played by Billy Bob Thorton.  Basically, Hugh refuses to be Billy Bob's poodle.  Obviously, the movie portrays a prime minister the likes of which most Britons would love to see, instead of the way that Tony Blair currently is.  <p>I also enjoyed the part that featured Colin Firth falling in love with his Portuguese housekeeper during a trip to France to write, but with whom he could not communicate.  He then learns a smattering of Portuguese, flies to her on Christmas Eve, and then in his halting Portuguese asks her to marry him, with her accepting in the halting English she has obviously just picked up.<p>This is not a great movie.  It will not be used in film classes to illustrate film writing technique or to show the way that the camera can tell a story in a way that is unique to film, but it is a heck of a lot of fun, and if one doesn't take it too seriously, will create a very, very good couple of hours of entertainment.</p></body></html>

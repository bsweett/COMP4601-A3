"Ghost Rider" is far from being a great film.  In fact, it's pretty bad in spots.  What makes it worthy of four stars, however, is the fact that the director and the cast seem to be having a whole lot of fun with a story that comes from way out of left field.<br /><br />In "Ghost Rider," Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) makes a deal with the devil, Mephistopheles (a cheeky Peter Fonda), in order to save his father's life.  As is always the case, the devil has an alternate plan in the works and tricks Johnny into becoming his lifelong bounty hunter, the Ghost Rider.  Blaze goes on to live what seems to be a charmed life where he dances with death constantly but never perishes.  When the devil's son, Blackheart (Wes Bentley), finally surfaces on Earth looking for one of his daddy's old contracts, the devil calls upon his rider to stop him.  Blaze transforms into the very imposing and very flaming Ghost Rider and seeks out Blackheart.  If he carries out this one mission, the devil agrees to rid him of his curse.  While on the hunt, Blaze has to juggle a rekindling romance between himself and his old flame, Roxanne (Eva Mendes), a stunt biking career managed by the very concerned Mack (a funny Donal Logue), and the belief that he's a murderer.  He also befriends the Caretaker (Sam Elliott), who seems to have all of the answers.<br /><br />Overall, this film is not great.  It's just that is has a wonderfully stylized feel with deep blue and fiery red colors all about it that plays with your inner child.  The atmosphere is light, despite the demonic undertones.  I often caught myself going ga-ga over the excellent CGI effects as the Rider tore up the side of a skyscraper or took out Blackheart's lackeys with tongue firmly in cheek.  Cage hams it up as Blaze, channeling the soul of Elvis as he swaggers across the screen.  Fonda and Elliott, both silver screen steadies, eat their respective roles up with demonic flare and lawdog wisdom.  Even the supposedly sinister Blackheart is fun to watch.  Most actors weighed down with dismal dialogue such as Bentley is given would collapse on the screen, but Bentley manages to make you laugh with the delivery of classic one-liners such as, "I don't think so!"  Eva Mendes seems to be the only person in the film who is remotely trying to take her role seriously, but even she seems to be having fun with this tale as well.<br /><br />Mark Steven Johnson ("Daredevil") knows how to make a film very cool despite a dodgy script.  Johnson uses some twisty camera angles to drop the viewer right into the middle of the action.  The fight sequences are fairly light on actual human action and rely heavily on CGI.  This makes for a rather weak climax, but you can't help but watch it.<br /><br />"Ghost Rider" isn't for everybody.  If you're a comic purist, you'll probably scoff at the way that this film picks and chooses elements of the entire "Ghost Rider" canon and collects them into one character.  If you're an action fan, you may grow tired of the constant CGI battle sequences.  However, if you've always loved B-movies and wonder what one would look like with a very large budget and a "knows what's cool looking" director guiding it, "Ghost Rider" is a definite purchase.  I personally enjoy it more than a lot of the other comic flicks I've seen.  With all of the dark and menacing adaptations flying around lately, it's nice to see a comic film that's just pure fun.</p></body></html>

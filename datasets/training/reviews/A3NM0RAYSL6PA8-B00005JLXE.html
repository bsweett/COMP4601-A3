Of course, you'd expect that from a movie that has a laughably bad fight/dance sequence involving Ben Affleck.  Yes, you heard right.  I was tempted to yell out, "Hey!  They're break dance fighting!"  Of course, I didn't.<p>Daredevil has plot that is mush--predictable when it ought to be surprising, dull when it ought to be exciting, and funny when it never really intends to be.  Ain't that a recipe for disaster?  I won't spend more time dissecting it because it just isn't worth it.  It represents the inevitable:  Bland corporate types seeing the Spiderman and X-Men money machines and wanting to cash in with uncreative drivel.  "Find me a superhero!  From Marvel if you can!  And get the Sexiest Guys on Earth to star!!  That's the ticket."<p>Don't make the same mistake I made.  Don't waste a good two hours.</p></body></html>

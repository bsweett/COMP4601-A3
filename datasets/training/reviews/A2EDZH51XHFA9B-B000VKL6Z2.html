It's very rare that a remake gets it even half-right, and when someone does a remake and attempts to add something, that way lies madness. Except when it works. I know I'm probably in the minority in thinking so--after all, the whole reason Michael Myers is scary in John Carpenter's classic Halloween is that we have absolutely no idea how he got that way, save for one scene at the beginning of the movie that tells us he's already messed up by the time he's ten years old--but I think Rob Zombie giving us Michael Myers' backstory in his Halloween remake actually works.<br /><br />In case you've been underwater for the last thirty years, the plot: a youngster named Michael Myers (played as a youth by Hancock's Daeg Faerch, as an adult by X-Men's Tyler Mane), sick of his abusive family, snaps and offs his stepfather and older sister. When his mother (played by Zombie's wife, Sheri Moon) gets home from her shift at the strip club, Myers is sitting outside the house holding his baby sister. Following this bit, we get half an hour of Myers growing up in the institution, being counselled by Dr. Loomis (Malcolm McDowell, about as perfect a replacement for Donald Pleasance as possible). Myers, of course, breaks ourt and heads back to Haddonfield, spending the rest of the film terrorizing Laurie Strode (Wicked Little Things' Scout Taylor-Compton) and her pals.<br /><br />Why does the backstory bit work here? Because Rob Zombie actually thought about it. From the looks of things, he spent years thinking about it. I grant you, it's pretty basic slasher-movie psychology these days--you have to try and make the killer sympathetic by showing that he was abused as a kid or whatever--but the kicker is that Zombie never once attempts to make Michael Myers in any way sympathetic. (You get the feeling for a while he's going to, but he resists the temptation.) It's a subtle subversion of that same slasher-movie psychology Zombie is borrowing wholesale, and it works. In fact, it's kind of brilliant, if you turn your head and squint the right way. Unfortunately, the film falls apart after that, becoming as generic a slasher movie as has come down the pike in some time, but the promise of the first half tells me Rob Zombie may actually be putting it together as a filmmaker. Much better than I expected. ***</p></body></html>

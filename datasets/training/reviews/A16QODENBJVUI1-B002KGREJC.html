Mind you, this film features a very good cast and everyone excels in their role, but if Ellen Page is in the scene -- and she is in nearly every scene in the film -- she dominates everything.  As the wisecracking, (almost) unflappable, and very pregnant 16-year-old Juno, Ellen Page steals this movie.  She has already been nominated for or out and out won a number of awards for her performance in JUNO (including the Screen Actor's Guild and the Golden Globes -- she is considered a lock for an Oscar nomination), and seemed destined to sweep all awards for break out performance of the year.  She really is that good in this film.  I'd noticed Ellen Page before.  I first became aware of her in the third X-MEN movie, when she played my favorite X-Man, Kitty Pryde aka Shadowcat.  She did a great job in a pretty small role.  Later I saw her in the independent Canadian film WILBY WONDERFUL.  Most people will know her from her role in HARD CANDY.  But JUNO could be more than a breakout role for Page.  This could be the making of a legitimate star.  She is both extremely young and extremely talented.  If she wants to be, she could well be the next Winona Ryder.  The "wants to be" could be huge.  From interviews it doesn't sound like she especially wants a star career.  JUNO was not a Hollywood production, but was instead filmed in Vancouver.  In the past a number of Canadian actors have turned their backs on Hollywood and stayed largely north of the border (Paul Gross and Sarah Polley are just two actors I can think of who could have had big careers had they "gone Hollywood," but instead fostered smaller but superb careers in Canada).  I would not be surprised if Ellen Page was one of those.  But I would also not be surprised if she gobbled up a score of very desirable roles for smart, sassy young women in the next several years.  One thing she certainly has going for her is versatility.  She has at age 20 already shown that she can excel in drama, comedy, and horror.  Her range as an actress seems unlimited.<br /><br />As great as Ellen Page is, much of her success has to be credited to Diablo Cody's incredibly witty script.  To be honest, this is not truly a great movie.  The central story isn't that substantial.  But a dominating lead performance stringing together an unending number of great one-liners can certainly give the appearance of greatness.  I don't remember the last time I saw a movie that had so many truly funny lines.  And for that Cody has to be given the credit.<br /><br />As mentioned above, the film has a great supporting cast.  I was especially impressed by Jennifer Garner, who plays what is largely an unsympathetic role (until fairly near the end of the film).  As the "uncool" half of the couple who plan on adopting Juno's child, she has to play completely against type.  As a huge ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT fan I was delighted to see both Michael Cera (for whom 2007 has been a very good year) and Jason Bateman together in the same film, though they didn't have any scenes together.  J. K. Simmons and Allison Janney were both wonderful as Juno's parents.  Rainn Wilson of THE OFFICE has a very small but memorable role as a convenience store clerk.<br /><br />One thing that struck me while watching this film is how few starring roles there have been for wisecracking young girls.  There have been scores of films featuring wisecracking teenage boys (one need only look back to SUPERBAD as a recent example).  But once one gets past JUNO and GHOST WORLD there aren't a huge number of comparable films for young girls.<br /><br />One other random comment.  There was a very strange moment in the film when I realized that every actor in the scene (excepting Jason Batman) had been in a major action movie or TV series.  This was when Juno and her father were meeting with the adopting couple and their lawyer for the first time.  Ellen Page had been in X3.  J. K. Simmons, who played her father, has memorably portrayed J. Jonah Jameson in the SPIDER-MAN movies.  Eileen Pedde, who played the Lorings' lawyer, is a regular on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA as Sgt. Mathias, a veteran marine.  And Jennifer Garner portrayed yet another Marvel superhero, Elektra, in a pair of films, as well as Sydney Bristow for five years on ALIAS.<br /><br />A couple of more random comments.  The opening credits are among the best I've seen in ages.  They apparently took photos of Eileen Page and digitized them somehow to produce an animated sequence.  Very compelling and quite unforgettable.  Finally, the film has a truly great soundtrack.  Almost every film these days has a great soundtrack, but this one was especially fine.  They use the music of Kimya Dawson pretty extensively (whose music, I must confess, has always underwhelmed me), but they also use a long string of gems by Belle and Sebastian, the Kinks, Buddy Holly, Sonic Youth, Mott the Hoople, and Cat Power for one of the best and most eclectic soundtracks I've heard.  They also name drop the Stooges, but alas use none of their or Iggy's songs.<br /><br />All in all, this is a really fine film.  I'm not sure it is a great movie, but there is no question that Ellen Page turns in one of the best performances of the year by any actor, male or female.  My best guess is that she will get nominated for an Oscar but will not win, though she probably deserves to.  The Academy tends to bless mediocrity, hates comedies, especially hates films dealing with culturally controversial topics (like teen pregnancy, though drug addiction is usually a ticket to a walk to the podium, so go figure), and usually rewards bloated, "serious" films.  But I'd be delighted if she defied tradition and won the Oscar.</p></body></html>

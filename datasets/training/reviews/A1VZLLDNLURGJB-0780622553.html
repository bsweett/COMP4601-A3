<meta name="summary" content="Dark City (1998)-Beautiful special effects, good performances, interesting ideas!"></head><body><p>I saw Dark City when it first came out in 1998 and believe it is a five star sci-fi thriller. Dark and colorful, it is another story of circumstances totally out of control masquerading as possible paranoid delusion.  The ending reminded me of the Matrix, but it was very interestingly done.<br /><br />It appears that the overused theme of an individual (or individuals) suffering from paranoia underwent an increase in usage in middle of the 90's in movies. Fortunately, it was pretty clear almost from the outset of the movie that this was not the case.  The atmosphere of the film was dark, brooding and always troubling, until its Matrix like ending.  John Murdoch is "the one"!<br /><br />This film had absolutely terrific special effects, and featured some good performances of an interesting theme.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="These hogs aren't that wild and never gain lift-off.  Never more than just pleasant"></head><body><p>If all you are after is a light weight comedy and are willing to laugh at some pretty standard jokes, well, this might be your ticket.  With all the star power brought to this thing, I was hoping for it to take flight, but its stubby little wings couldn't these Wild Hogs in the air.<br /><br />Sure, everyone in the movie is likeable.  Even the really bad guys in the movie, the Del Fuegos never reach sinister.  They yell, they threaten, they are pretty creepy, but do they ever really become dangerous.  Nah.  And in this kind of fluff, they aren't supposed to. Then why have them at all?  And take Ray Liotta as their leader, Jack.  Why would he take so ferociously after these four dweebs?  It just didn't make any sense except that the plot needed it.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the town of Madrid, its Sheriff Charly (Stephen Tobolowsky), and even trying hard to believe in Marisa Tomey as Maggie the owner of the town's diner, it was all so predictable and offered nothing really surprising.  Maybe because it is all based on the clich&eacute; of the male mid-life crisis times the four members of the Wild Hogs sort-of-club.<br /><br />But if you want some jokes and don't care that they are pretty ordinary and you want to see a bunch of stars on the screen and don't care too much about what they are saying and doing, then this can be a decent entertainment.  Just don't expect much wild anything.</p></body></html>

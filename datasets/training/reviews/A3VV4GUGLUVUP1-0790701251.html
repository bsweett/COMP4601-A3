The problem is the film's two-part structure.  The first story it tells is such a compelling and fresh take on familiar war-movie material, there's no way the second half can live up to it. <p> Matthew Modine stars as Joker and serves as the narrarator.  The first sequence takes place in boot camp, where Joker and the other recruits learn what it means to be a modern warrior.  R. Lee Ermey, as the DI, completely dominates this half; his character gets almost all the movie's best lines and is such an original and powerful character, the story never quite recovers after his exit.  The boot camp scenes have a nightmarish quality; most effective is the lecture where Ermey praises the sharpshooting skills of former Marines such as Lee Harvey Oswald.  I can't think of another film with such a boot camp setting that matches &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; in intensity- not &quot;Sands of Iwo Jima,&quot; certainly not the otherwise enjoyable comedy &quot;Biloxi Blues.&quot; <p> Then the movie moves to Vietnam in time for the Tet Offensive and the Marine battle at Hue City, and despite its increasing violence, the story begins to sag and feel a bit repetitive.  Joker, now  a combat reporter, meets up with a rifle squad for the fighting at Hue.  The combat scenes have a grungy veracity, and when the troops finally enter the city and meet a sniper, there's a growing terror and suspense... unfortunately, the payoff scene runs much to long, with a pat and disappointing moral quandary for Joker and his fellow Marines.  It's as if Kubrick wasn't sure his themes of dehumanization and brutality have been slammed home enough.  But believe me, they have. <p> Still, &quot;Full Metal Jacket&quot; has to be considered one of the best war movies.  Instead of merely focusing on the action, it examines the psychology of the battlefield mind.  The Marines are close to the edge, and their comaraderie borders on the psychotic.  One in particular laments that back home, he won't have anyone around worthy enough to shoot.  Very eerie and effective. <p> Standouts besides the amazing Ermey include Vincent D'Onofrio as a dim-witted screw-up nicknamed &quot;Pyle&quot; and Adam Baldwin (from &quot;My Bodyguard&quot; and &quot;Independence Day&quot;) as the ultra-mean Animal Mother.</p></body></html>

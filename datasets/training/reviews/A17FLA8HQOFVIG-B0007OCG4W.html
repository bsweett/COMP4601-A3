<meta name="summary" content="Slick, clever, sophisticated and complex.  I loved it!."></head><body><p>This 2004 film isn't for everybody.  It's slick and clever and requires full attention to appreciate.  When I first started watching, I wasn't prepared for this and nearly turned it off because it was a little  hard to follow.<br /><br />All that changed however, and, by the time I had been watching for fifteen minutes, I was completely engrossed.  I did a double take, sat back and relaxed and enjoyed the unfolding of this complicated story directed by Mike Nichols, based on a play by Patrick Marber.  The acting was exceptional too.  And even though the actors were easily recognizable film stars, they each portrayed their characters so well, that I soon only saw them as the people they were portraying.<br /><br />The story is set in London, where, in an early scene Natalie Portman and Jude Law fall in love.  She's a young American with dyed purple hair; he's a Brit who writes obituaries for a newspaper.  Later, he writes a book and has his photo taken by Anna, a professional photographer, played by Julia Roberts.  He's wildly attracted to her but she rejects him.  He's angry and decides to play a practical joke.  This involves the internet and a chatroom in which he writes explicit romantic notes to Clive Owens and pretends to be Anna.  This causes Anna and Clive Owens to meet and they soon become lovers.<br /><br />This just the beginning through, and the rest of the story plays out in increasingly complex and interesting ways.  These four people deceive each other, lie, tell piercingly brutal truths and suffer complex emotional pain.  There are constant surprises and turns and twists.  Each character took turns at being the one I hated.  And then things change and I was forced to re-think the scene I just saw as the film becomes faster paced as it moves along.  I couldn't take my eyes off the screen.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this film and give it one of my highest recommendations.  However, it is only for those with a sophisticated appreciation of human complexity.</p></body></html>

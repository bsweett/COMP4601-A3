ASIDE FROM ALL THE ACTION, THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF COMEDY. GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS AND A GREAT VILLAIN, WHO'S PLAYED BY VINCENT D'ONOFRIO. SCI-FI FANS WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED WITH THIS MOVIE. EVERYONE WHO'S A FAN OF WILL SMITH OR TOMMY LEE JONES, SHOULD HAVE THIS IN THEIR DVD COLLECTION. FOLLOWED BY A SEQUEL AND A SHORT-LIVED ANIMATED TV SERIES.</p></body></html>

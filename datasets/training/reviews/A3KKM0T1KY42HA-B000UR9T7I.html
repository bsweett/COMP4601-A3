<meta name="summary" content="Raimi Goes Shumacher"></head><body><p>As I was watching Spiderman 3 I was reminded of when Joel Schumacher took the reins from Tim Burton (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B5XOY8">Batman</a>/<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B5XOSO">Batman Returns</a>) to direct <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B5XOXY">Batman Forever</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B5XOXO">Batman & Robin</a>. Remember how Schumacher brought back the campy TV series Batman (especially for Batman & Robin) and destroyed the dark nature of the Batman series that Burton created?<br /><br />I wouldn't say that Spiderman 3 was as bad as Batman & Robin, but it was on par with Batman Forever...just an average movie. And that is surprising. Because it's not like there was a directorial change in the Spiderman series; Sam Raimi has been there from the start.<br /><br />Spiderman 3 has a...what's the word...'lighter' feel than the first two. It's brighter. It's a little campy at times. It's a little unrealistic. The effects are way over-the-top at times...especially The Green Goblin's glider skills. Spiderman 3 is just a lot less believable than the first two.<br /><br />Spiderman 3 was very fun to watch though. I was thoroughly entertained. Great visuals in high def (I watched the Blu Ray version). The first two Spiderman movies focus mainly on Spiderman's confrontation with one foe per film, but there are several villains in Spiderman 3. This helps provide an abundance of action.<br /><br />But the action doesn't save the movie from its wide stretches of reality. Sam Raimi is great at taking unfathomable situations, adding a little silliness, but making it all seem real. He just didn't do it as well in Spiderman 3 as he's clearly capable of doing it. So that took some of the shine off of Spiderman 3 for me.<br /><br />Let's hope that Raimi brings his A-game to Spiderman 4 announced for a 2009 release.</p></body></html>

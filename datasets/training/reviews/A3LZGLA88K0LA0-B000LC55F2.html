<meta name="summary" content="YOU CAN DO MAGIC"></head><body><p>THE PRESTIGE is a sumptuous, atmospheric, if ultimately empty tale of deception and misdirection.  MEMENTO's Christopher Nelson uses his typical enigmatic writing and directing style to weave an interesting if sometimes confusing tale of magical revenge.  Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale competently portray the two competitive magicians constantly trying to outdo the other, particularly Jackman who holds Bale responsible for the tragic death of his magician wife.  The ineffable Michael Caine plays Jackman's mentor who tries to help him best his competitor but also give him good advice not to go too far.<br /><br />I found the movie entertaining, but wasn't completely satisfied with its protracted resolution.</p></body></html>

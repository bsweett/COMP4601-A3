(When is the era, anyhow?  Though Eisenheim uses actual firepots to illuminate his act, it must be set somewhat after the age of electricity, for Paul Giamatti's police constables produce from nowhere a fully operative movie projector and switch it on!)  (And on an adjoining screen we see a sophisticated, and Technicolor moving image years before Technicolor was actually invented!)  Like Coppola's DRACULA, or like the recent musical MOULIN ROUGE, director Neil Burger brings in the flaws and cracks of silent era film, and instantly takes us back to the day, though it's not 100 per cent convincing.  Nor is his use of Prague for Vienna of all places, when the two cities are so radically different, but Prague must be fantastically cheaper to film in.  But that's standard movie practice today, the way that, if one's only exposure to New York City was through the cinema, you would be forgiven for thinking it looks exactly like Toronto.<br /><br />Anyhow I soon found myself caught up in the story, and to my surprise, Paul Giamatti was much better than he's been in years, and as for Jessica Biel, well, she has a new spring in her step, and she repays the confidence Burger placed in her, for her part couldn't have been an easy one and yet she's truthful and honest in nearly every scene.  Does Ed Norton ever hold a ball of light as he does on the DVD cover and poster?  I don't think so, but the one pose Eisenheim falls into, arm extended, fingers charging the air around his hand with electricity, is a commanding, Universal horror one.  It might also have been invented by Karloff or Lugosi, and yet Norton carries it off.<br /><br />Who was that actress from Canada who used to be in every other spooky sort of art movie, like Cronenberg's CRASH or Fincher's THE GAME--and she looked like a prototype for Jessica Biel, with the same unseeing eyes and fat, bruised lips?  I know, I know, Deborah Kara Unger.  She wouldn't have been bad either.  She's so great and I haven't seen her since WHITE NOISE.<br /><br />In THE ILLUSIONIST, is it just me, or how bad is Burger's dialogue whenever Jessica Biel is addressed?  She's playing Sophie, the Duchess von Teschen.  Does this mean that fellow noblewomen will be saying, "Your dress is so pretty, Duchess von Teschen!"  The best is when she goes missing and the Vienna Woods swarm with volunteers all calling out, "Duchess von Teschen!  Duchess von Teschen!"  No wonder she's not responding, boys.</p></body></html>

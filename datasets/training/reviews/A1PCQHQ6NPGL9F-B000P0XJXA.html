Well, thanks for those helpful reviews about how the movie is &quot;bad&quot; over and over, but that doesn't help people. <p>It isn't bad. Matter of fact, it is pretty good. The first few minutes are corny, but the rest of the movie is great. Basically Val Kilmer tracks this 19-year-old girl down. He shoots alot of people and the action is great. I mean, it's not like he has a futuristic blaster and blasts people in the shoulder. I love movies with guns that look real and I love seeing cool gun fights. This movie has quite a few gun fights and they are good. They are imaginable also. The guns are awesome.<p>The movie's plot is okay, but again, the gun fights and guns make it worth watching. Also, the plot has quite a few twists, including alot of things that you wouldn't exactly be prepared for.<p>This movie isn't &quot;bad&quot;. It's good, and after watching it I was pretty impressed.</p></body></html>

I will agree that this movie is not a classic but I really feel like every time I see it I have watched a truly entertaining film. I think this film is a lot like the comics or at least a lot like some versions of the comics, and it is really a great story. I think that this film has a lot of heart which is unusual for this type of film, most comic adaptations are action based as were this one seems more character driven. This film was not given the credit it deserved and neither did the cast or crew.<br /><br />Bruce Banner is a young researcher that is not only in love with his fellow co worker but is also drawn to studying gamma radiation. Of course every one knows that an accident happens at the lab that exposes him to those rays and when those rays mesh with the present inside his body that his long lost father left him, well he turns green. From here we have a whole story that involves love, a father who only wants to use his "experiment" I mean son, and the military. All of this put together makes for one interesting film, a lot better then I thought it would be. Plus the battle at the end is cool and that is always a plus.<br /><br />Director Ang Lee who is a wonderful filmmaker did a marvelous job with this film, he turned what could have been just your basic comic movie into a more dramatic tale of tragedy. His direction in this film can be felt all through out the finished product and I really think that he was the perfect choice for this film. Credit of course should also go to writers James Schamus, John Turman, and Michael France who really did something unexpected with this film. This movie is a real emotional based story that relies more on the characters then the action, those three should be complimented for penning this. Frederick Elmes shot this film masterfully and Tim Squyres's editing is flawless, every one should be commended. Eric Bana is completely believable as Bruce Banner and does a real good job with this part, lot of people said this part should have went to some one else. Jennifer Connelly portrays Betty Ross extremely well and I don't think any one would disagree with me on that. Sam Elliott, Josh Lucas, and Cara Buono all are good in this film as well and each of them really make this film all the more entertaining. But it is Nick Nolte in my opinion who really steals the show on this one as Bruce's long lost father who is extremely obsessed with continuing his work. So much so that he doesn't even care about his own son although it seems that he does for a while. In fact it is the dynamic between him and Eric Bana that really make this film, very emotional between these two.<br /><br />Of course not every thing about this film is great, there are a few things that keep this from being a classic. I think the main thing that brings this film down a little in many peoples minds is the length. This is actually a fairly long film that at times feels like it is dragging, so I can understand that. I think because this was more character driven and played on the emotion of the characters a lot it tended to let everything play out a bit slowly. Another thing is that the CGI in this film is not exactly the greatest ever, in fact the Hulk looks more cartoonish at times then intimidating.<br /><br />Still even with those flaws I still think that this was a good movie, much better then most people give it credit for. Who knows maybe because so many others hated it I liked it, but I did.<br /><br />Also this film has some great special features including a nice commentary by Ang Lee</p></body></html>

The loose story of the Supremes, I mean Dreams is fairly entertaining but not as engrossing as I would have hoped.  I found I didn't really care that much about any of the characters.  I especially didn't like the Hudson character Effie.  I was hoping for her fall since her first minute on screen.  She has a nice voice, but I couldn't stand her character.  I guess I was hoping this would play less like a broadway show and go deeper into the characters like a movie.  As it jumped forward in time, often I was hoping it would slow down a bit to see the transformation that every character seem to go through.  This is worth seeing if only for the great music.</p></body></html>

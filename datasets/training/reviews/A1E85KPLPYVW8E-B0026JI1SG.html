Aside from the great performances in the film and the gloomy overcast camera work that sets the tone to the film very well, I had a few problems with the script. I was enjoying the film at about 4 1/2 stars during the first two acts, but what happened in the final act made me drop it down to a 4 star rating. When Maggie goes down and is paralyzed from a dirty boxing fight, I couldn't help but feel that this was so very Oscar cliched. A story of a poor girl (designed to make you feel sorry for her) rises to the top and then tragedy strikes and all that is taken away from her and she dies in the end. The Oscars and critics took this formulaic drama setup hook, line, and sinker. With this in my mind, I had a hard time getting totally emotional at the end. Another part I had a problem with was with how Clint Eastwood's character just walsed in the hospital, assisted Maggie's suicide and then left like it was some normal thing. In real life, his ass would be sitting in prison for euthanasia.<br /><br />It sounds like I'm bashing this movie completely, but I really did like it. I just don't allow myself to be brainwashed into thinking this is the best movie of my life just because that's what the Oscars want me to think. It's awesomely acted by some very fine actors who bring a sense of complete realism to their characters, and it's excellently shot, but I feel Clint Eastwood has done better and there were better films that 2004 produced that were more deserving of the best picture award such as the biopics The Aviator or Ray.</p></body></html>

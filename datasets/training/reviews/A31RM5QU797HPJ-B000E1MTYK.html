<meta name="summary" content="The Return of Lord Voldemort"></head><body><p>The 4th Harry Potter movie is the first of the movies to earn the PG-13 rating..and it won't be the last.  They did a fine job of compressing the longest of the Harry Potter books into a movie.  The Dursleys aren't in the film (I was looking forward to see that Ton Tongue Toffee scence in the movie), and Harry has finally discovers girls. That's right, Harry and Ron truly discover that Hermonie is a girl.<br /><br />  The Triwizard Tournament takes place at Hogwarts, and Harry is looking forward to it...until his name comes out of the Goblet Of Fire and joins the tournament.  The tournament has 3 tasks of which the four champions must face.  The first task is to get a golden egg from a fierce dragon.<br /><br />  But that's not all what's happening.  Harry has dreams about Voldemort.  Rita Skitter could've been more threatening in the movie than she is in the book.<br /><br />  At the end of the movie, Voldemort returns and the movies will get even darker.</p></body></html>

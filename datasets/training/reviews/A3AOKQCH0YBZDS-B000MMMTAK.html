Even the outtakes/bonus footage are hilarious. Highly recommend watching this film.<br /><br />Best scene/most hilarious scene is where Borat and his sidekick have a naked wrestling match over Pamela Anderson in their hotel room. The wrestling match finds its way down to the hotel's ground floor & into a large banquet room where a mortgage banking convention is occurring!</p></body></html>

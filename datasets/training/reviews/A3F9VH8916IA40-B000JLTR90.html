<meta name="summary" content="why did i like it? 3 and a half."></head><body><p>That is the question. The story was all mixed up and didn't seem to have any focus, the characters weren't well developed, the acting wasn't great, and yet I really liked it. Why?<br /><br />The story is about a water nimph that lives in a pool and comes out to, okay I don't really know what she came out for, and meets up with this guy that owns a hotel and has a stutter. then she decides she wants to go back but cant because there is this big dog that looks like a wolf and has grass growing on its back that attacks her but shouldn't because of the three monkeys who enforce the rules but their not dong their job so the nimph has to find the guild, the healer, the interrupter, and the guardian who all happen to live in the hotel to try to get her back into the pool before the dog thing can eat her. Wow, did you get any of that? if you did, go see a doctor.<br /><br />Anyway the whole movie is like this. The nimph fish person, whatever she is, comes out of this guy's pool naked and the guy with the stutter doesn't even offer her any cloths. He doesn't even ask why she was in the water in the first place. And everyone in the movie just sort of accepts whatever the nimph person says as truth. Come on. If some lady came out of my pool and told me that a dog covered in grass was trying to kill her and that I had to find a group of people to help her get back in the pool, I'd think she was retarded or something. The last thing I'd do is believe her.<br /><br />Now for the good. This movie is full of symbolism and a deep message. There are parts in this film that, although they don't make any sense, are very powerful and show Shamalaws true creative genes. If you can just suspend your belief for this movie it is really enjoyable. But if you're like me and like to analyze every part of the movie, you might be left a little disappointed. if you read this review, please leave a comment.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="what about Krystals?"></head><body><p>In line with all of the other road trip/teen movies of the last few years, this fits right in there, not as special, just mildly humorous.<br /><br />  Why just look at the premise?  Two minor foreign character stereotypes from other teen films go searching for America's finest, White Castle.  Yeah, it's weak, and honestly a bit better then most in this genre, but still just average overall.<br /><br />  The characters themselves are funny, while the situations are okay.  As expected the adventure leans to the obscene, perverse, and raunchy.  Some like that; however, I was just amazed that the trip was semi-interesting.<br /><br />  Now, I know this is going to be upsetting to read for those who like this type of film, but it is really just average, and probably less.  Nevertheless, if you found other teen films funny, then be prepared for the humor.  What can I say, but to each his own.</p></body></html>

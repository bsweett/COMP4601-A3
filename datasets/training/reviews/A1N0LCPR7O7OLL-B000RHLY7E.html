<meta name="summary" content="Rob Zombie is a beast!"></head><body><p>This is the first cult film classic in many a moon and Rob Zombie delivers the goods in his second feature the sequel to House Of  a 1000 Corpses (Sid Haig and Sheri Moon are on fire in this one -- William Forsythe and Ken Foree also rocked the house.)  I can't even begin to tell you how much I loved this movie and how much Hollywood needed this movie.  This is a full blown 70's style nightmare and its works on so many levels I can't even begin to tell you.  The most important level I think the film works on whether this was intentional or not (and I think that it most certainly was) is in the question "Who are the villains in our world?"  The film clearly seems to be saying we all are.  And thats what makes the film so relevant in a demented way and without a doubt pure brilliance for a film in its genre.  The casting is genius, the writing is unbelievable (gives Tarantino a serious run for his money), and the soundtrack is to die for.  The only warning I feel I have to give about it other than that it is extremely violent and has some of the roughest language you will ever hear is that it is NOT a traditional horror film.  It is more in line with a Sam Peckinpah film like Straw Dogs than say Dawn of the Dead.  Which is a major compliment to be sure.  If you're in any way a fan of hillbilly/redneck films, Tobe Hooper flicks like Chainsaw and Eaten Alive, violent blacksploitation, The Munsters, The Marx Brothers, or the italian giallo fare from the 70's you're gonna love this mad work of artistic genius that is the first truly great film of the year.  Can't wait to see what Zombie does next.</p></body></html>

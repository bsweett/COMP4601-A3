Back a million years ago, everyone wanted to see Dracula vs. Frankenstein, Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman, etc. Also, remember all of those Godzilla vs. Anyone-in-a-rubber-monster-suit movies on TV? Well, AVP is just the modern version of these silly match-ups. In such films, plot is secondary at best, as the whole reason for making / watching them is to see a monster smack-down. Remember Freddy vs. Jason? Was the storyline all that important, or was it just an excuse to get these two horror icons together? Hmmm. AVP: R wasn't completely awful, although it was way too dark (and I don't mean sinister). I had a hard time following it during much of the action, due to the lack of decent lighting. I turned the brightness way up and watched it in a room w/ no lights on -AT NIGHT! I still had trouble descerning what was going on at times! This was pretty frustrating! Now, as far as what I could see, I did not like the idea of the babies getting eaten, but at least it was only implied! As for the pregnant lady, it was gross, though it did fit the idea of making the "predalien" utterly reprehensible and worthy of extermination. The human "heroes" were generic, monster-fodder. What else could they be? Let's face it, in a movie like this, it's all about the critters killing each other anyway! In that respect, AVP: R isn't bad. I just wish I could have seen more of it!...</p></body></html>

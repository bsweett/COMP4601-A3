The magic of great cinematography. Director Robert Wise wowed film goers with great opening shots of New York skyscrapers in "West Side Story," but went one step further in "The Sound of Music" with its lush mountain beauty. Julie Andrews spinning on top of a mountain peak singing the title song makes for great moments in filmdom.<br /><br />One of the most family friendly movies of all-time, each viewing takes us back to a time of innocence in our lives. Who doesn't fight back the tears of seeing a harsh Christopher Plummer, playing the widowed father of the Von Trapp clan, allowing his affections to once again break through towards his 7 children, as he joins them in song. Or one of my favorite moments, the "So Long, Farewell" sung by the children at the  gathering of adult guests. I find myself wanting to wave goodnight to them as well. Sweet and tender, this film melts the heart of even the most "manly of men." So pop it into the DVD player, and gather the family around for some old fashioned bonding.<br /><br />1965 Academy Award winner for Best Picture.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Iron Man"></head><body><p>You I had heard many times this is an awesome movie, and I agree. When I was a kid Iron Man was my favorite comic book so I was happy about this transition to the screen. The story, acting, directing, effects, and music were excellent. Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, and Jeff Bridges give stand out performances. I can't wait for the sequels. The DVD quality is excellent and the single disc played fine on DVD player and PC. The only extras are the deleted scenes on the single disc but then it was only $14.99 if you pre-ordered. I highly recommend this movie if you enjoy action movies. Great quality DVD with exceptional replayability. If you enjoyed this catch "Batman Begins" and "Hellboy". Some super heroe sequels aren't as good on many of the super hero original movies and a couple were less than stellar on the first release, let's hope Iron Man sequels will be the exception.<br /><br />CA Luster</p></body></html>

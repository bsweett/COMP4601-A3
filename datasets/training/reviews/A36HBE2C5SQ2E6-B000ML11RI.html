<meta name="summary" content="A Masterwork of Cinema. A movie that oozes originality."></head><body><p>Sin City is based on the graphic novels by Frank Miller, who is also the co-director. The movie is split into three stories: Dwight's, Merv's, and Hartigan's. Quentin Taratino is also a guess director.<br /><br />The movie starts off with Hartigan, a "60 year old cop with a bum ticker" and he is trying to save a little girl from being raped. He  ends up sacrficing himself for the girl, "a old man for a young girl". We cut to Merv's story, when a hooker is dead in his bed, and he has the blame placed on his shoulders, he tries to find the man that killed her, and avenges her. We then cut to Dwight, who is then thrown into the war between the prostitutes and the city police, They are seriously teething on the brink of war, and He must find a way to stop what could be deadly. Then, We are thrown back into Hartigan's story, 8 years later, he is in the same situtation, but the people have changed. He has to stop the Yellow Bastard from raping Nancy again.<br /><br />This movie almost didn't happen because The Director's Guild of America didn't want Robert Rodreqiuz to make this film, so he quit the quild, and worked with Frank Miller on this film, creating a page by page movie that makes you feel that the book had come alive on the movie screen. The acting is at its best, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen and Bruce Willis do their best acting, since their last best acting, and help shape and mold the movie. This is a prime example of esteemed originality, and hard work. It is a might fine film that can put you on a roller coster ride through the place that is called Sin City.</p></body></html>

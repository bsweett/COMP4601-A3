<meta name="summary" content="All time classic, very clean presentation"></head><body><p>"It's a Wonderful Life", initially greeted with meager enthusiasm by the movie going public, who thought it too depressing for a Christmas film, finally came into its own when the days of TV syndication came along. It was given an extra boost due to the fact that through inattention, the copyright ran out! When TV stations realized they could show it with no royalties due, it became a popular item in their schedules. Movie fans, with a second chance to appreciate this film, found that they liked it after all. Once you understand that George Bailey's life is full and rich, even if it never followed the course he himself had imagined for it, you understand that the movie isn't depressing at all. No matter how many times I view "It's a Wonderful Life", I still get a little choked up at the end.<br /><br />This was Jimmy Stewart's first film role after serving in, literally, heroic fashion as a bomber commander during World War II. Despite being a star and subject to assignment in "morale roles" if he had so chosen, Stewart went into the Air Corp and flew a complete tour of 25 bomber missions. He also flew a number of other live missions that were tallied as flights where he trained air crews. When offered the chance to have those missions count against his tour of 25, he declined. If you know anything about the history of WWII, you know that bomber crew duty in the European theater was pretty much the most dangerous combat assignment in the war.<br /><br />This DVD presentation is extremely well done. Whether from a clean print or a masterful restoration (or a combination of the two), the movie is free of artifacts of the type you find in old film prints or a rushed digital transfer. When you compare the actual film to scenes shown as examples in the two included documentaries, you can see what I mean.<br /><br />And mentioning the two documentaries, they are very satisfying. One is hosted by Frank Capra Jr., the son of the famous director of the film. He narrates interesting facts about his father and this film in particular in a warm tone that makes you feel part of the process. The second feature is hosted by Tom Bosley (the father on "Happy Days"). That documentary is, I believe, somewhat longer. It goes into some of the casting choices that could have been made, which I always find interesting. Both have tidbits of history and trivia about the film that are anywhere from interesting to fascinating ... including an explanation of how the film was actually shot during a record heat wave!<br /><br />"It's a Wonderful Life" has become arguably the top Christmas classic, in part due to its heavy exposure on TV, and in part because the film is so good it holds up under that heavy exposure very well. It is a must see for our family every Christmas season, and I have to say that I'm happy to own a DVD with a presentation of this high quality, so that I'm not subject to the random quality of prints shown on TV broadcasts.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="A HILARIOUS send up of Star Trek's obsessive fans"></head><body><p>I don't know why, but I didn't see this movie until after it had come out on video.  I certainly missed out on seeing it on the big screen.  It was by NO MEANS a masterpiece, but being a 'Trekkie' myself, it was easy to see the obvious similarities to Star Trek and how SOME (but by no means all) of the fans practically see the show as REALITY.  Not just funny, but if you consider yourself a pretty hard-nosed Trek fan, you will either find it hilarious or an incredible insult.<p>Tim Allen is absolutely PERFECT as the Captain from a Sci-Fi series from I would guess the late 70's to early 80's.  Since the cancellation of the series, he as well as the rest of the major characters from the series are herded from one sci-fi convention to another for a chance to sign autographs for the fans of the show that are, let's face it: so INTO it that they have memorized entire episodes and come dressed as their favorite characters.  These folks lives pretty much revolve around this show, and those who acted IN it.  But like the loveable James T. Kirk, Tim Allen is despised by the other actors because of his arrogance towards the supporting characters and nobody is more surprised than he when honest-to-goodness aliens arrive seeking help from him and his crew to save their entire civilization.<p>This group of advanced aliens are gentle, peace-loving squid-like creatures that have intercepted 'Galaxy Quest' as it was broadcast and went beyond the reaches of our Solar System and<p>being naive as they are, actually believe this TV series to be the REAL THING--even more so than the most hard-core TV fan on earth.  They ACTUALLY believe that the crew will assist them to battle an enemy who wants to destroy our peace-loving squids, well decimate the entire race, actually.  It all is full of laughs and incredible situations which they amazingly escape from (just like the characters from the TV show...imagine THAT!) and with tongue planted firmly in cheek 'Galaxy Quest' never takes itself too seriously.  If you are a Trekkie, you are in for a real treat.  If you just casually enjoy sci-fi movies, you should get a kick outta this...but if you totally dislike these kinds of films, you may want to check out something else--but I STILL think its worth a look.  All in all a fantastic and funny romp through the Universe.</p></body></html>

(`The Davinci Code,' `Inside Man,' and `National Treasure,' come to mind.)  Such is the case with `Zodiac,' except this film is a true-to-life crime story about a serial killer who stalked victims in Vallejo and San Francisco, CA starting in 1969.  It was unprecedented at the time because the police success rate was good until then, and the "Summer of Love" was a not-too-distant memory.  Gripping at times, the whole movie becomes an illuminating account of heinous crimes by a clever killer who managed to slip out of investigators hands for years.<br /><br />Starting in Vallejo a mysterious hooded stranger stalks a teenage couple who are parked at Lovers' Lane on the Fourth of July.  In a separate car he stops by and harasses them briefly before returning to the scene.  Using a gun with a flashlight attached, he mercilessly shoots and kills both of them in the car.  There are other similar acts that follow scattered from that first murder, but he refuses to remain completely anonymous. Thriving on publicity, he calls the police to announce his crimes--briefly, but precisely identifying his cruel acts with his victims.  He also sends letters to `The San Francisco Chronicle' with code work meant for them to decipher. Similar confidence appears as he announces their cruel fate to loved ones and sends letters with no code, written in handwriting hard to trace.  Nicknamed "Zodiac" he terrorizes the people of California, leaving clues like a morbid real-life Riddler.  Having skeletons in his closet and a fascination for the short story, "The Most Dangerous Game," Zodiac remained mysterious, yet committed to his mayhem.<br /><br />Most of the drama zeroes in of the investigation, which is two fold.  For 'The San Francisco Chronicle' columnist, Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.) and political cartoonist, Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) are at odds with one another, but see eye to eye enough to share drinks and some of the investigation together.  In another part of town, Inspector Dave Tocchi (Mark Ruffalo) tries to piece it all together.  He's smart and thorough, but has many difficulties.  As the years go by, we see suspects come and go and how little pieces of the puzzle fit together to find a composite portrait.  Obviously, it is not a labor of love, given the scope and energy required for the project, but one of the ironies of the story is Graysmith's persistence with the case.  Having an inquisitive and ambitious nature himself, he doesn't have the sensibility to throw in the towel.<br /><br />`Zodiac' is not only fascinating, but is laid-back enough to give us a true-to-life drama.  All of the actors only magnify the account by their grasp of the humanness of their characters.  The three stars Gyllenhaal, Downey, and Ruffalo especially keep it real.  Thanks to director David Fincher and screenwriter James Vanderbilt, we are transported to a troubled time and place with expert detail.  It is suspenseful at times, but the understatement along with some old newsreels only adds to the authenticity.  Their weariness and the problems they face make it all the more human.  Both journalists grapple with ambition while they juggle their responsibilities and their personal lives.  Both Paul and Robert are contacted by the killer and the repercussions quietly take their toll.  'Zodiac' excels at method and execution, retracing the steps of ordinary people trying to solve an extraordinary crime.</p></body></html>

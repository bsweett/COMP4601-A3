<meta name="summary" content="A Million Dollar Meditation"></head><body><p>Clint Eastwood's "Million Dollar Baby" is a parable and a meditation about greed, exploitation, and redemption. Eastwood himself stars as Frankie,a boxer who runs a gym. He "doesn't train girls" but the determined Maggie (Hilary Swank) wants to be a champion. Morgan Freeman stars as Eastwood's mentor&friend. Their relationship shows that true friendship transcends race. Freeman is an excellent actor; unfortunately, his near-constant voice-over gets intrusive&heavy-handed. Eastwood,show,don't tell!<br /><br />Frankie is as determined as Maggie- he wants to win at any cost- and he pays the price. He exploits Maggie for the money, even pitting her against a famously brutal female boxer known for cheating. Frankie knowingly endangers Maggie&she naively accepts the challenge. However, Frank does have a conscience. He is repulsed whenever Maggie tells him to "put her down" if she is seriously injured.<br /><br />"Million Dollar Baby" shows the seamy underside of female boxing. Boxing between men has an air of legitimacy, while female boxers live in a world of exploitation, treated as freaks. It also comes across as homoerotic. It's no wonder Maggie's redneck mother tells her to "get a man"-but maybe Maggie prefers being surrounded by bikini-clad babes&battling more muscular ones.<br /><br />"Million Dollar Baby" is controversial because of it's "death with dignity" theme. The young priest warns Frank that if he puts Maggie out of her misery,it will lead to more tragedy. It's not a solution. The priest's prophecy comes true. Frank gives Maggie the lethal injection- and exiles himself from the human community. He doesn't live "happily ever after." On the other hand, Freeman's character is happily reunited with the boxer whose life he saved. Choosing life is redemptive. Some have painted "Million Dollar Baby" as propaganda. One wonders if they actually watched the movie, or if they're merely parroting what talk show hosts told them.<br /><br />"Million Dollar Baby" has excellent acting,a beautiful score. Its weaknesses are Freeman's near-constant narration (though he has a wonderful baritone) and often stereotypical characters (such as Maggie's family) It's not one of the best Oscar-winning movies; it's still a champion.</p></body></html>

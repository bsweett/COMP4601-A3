<meta name="summary" content="Good, yet strangly unfulfilling."></head><body><p>This is a nicely packaged set for this famous 70's film.  Tons of extra info is included for those who wish to delve into the minutae of the films development and arrival on the screen.  This is one of Spielberg's more intriguing films, yet it leaves me curiously unmoved.  The storyline is good.  The effects are really good.  The script is good.  The locations are fantastic.  The acting is good.  I don't know what it is, but this is a film that I am rarely tempted to watch.  For me, this is a &quot;pull it out once every five years&quot; film.  I find the development of the plot lines to be interesting and one that raises numerous questions.  I just am not terribly interested in the way the director chose to answer those questions.  It doesn't gel for me.  In the end I kind of have a 'so that's it?' feeling.  <p>The DVD treatment here is exquisite-more than you need really, but that is a good thing.  I found the extras more compelling than the film itself.  I probably would not recommend the film on its own, but the inclusion of so much other material makes this a good buy.</p></body></html>

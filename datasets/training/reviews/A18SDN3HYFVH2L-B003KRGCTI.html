<meta name="summary" content="Denzel makes this silly film with a ridiculous ending worth it, just about"></head><body><p>Super-bad dude (Denzel Washington) is walking west through an entirely typical post-apocalyptic desert landscape.  It's all shot on digital video, and for once the format looks just right for the gray, washed-out landscapes.  After wasting a bunch of thugs with a wicked long knife/short sword, Denzel wanders into a one-horse town run by a nasty boss-type guy played by who else?  Ben Gazzara.  No, just kidding, but Gary Oldman is channeling him I think.  Heck, I dunno, maybe there's just a generic amoral town boss type and everybody tends towards it if they play these roles enough.<br /><br />Also in the town are Tom Waits as a shopkeeper (entertaining for his few minutes of time but wasted) and Mila Kunis as the daughter of Oldman's blind kept woman, Jennifer Beals.  After Denzel goes all Toshiro Mifune on a bunch of Oldman's men who've just returned from raiding, Oldman takes an interest; and after finding out that Denzel has a precious book, he's even more interested.  You want to guess what the book is?  I don't think you'll find it too hard...<br /><br />This is a rather silly and derivative movie that vacillates between various tough guy genres - post-apocalyptic science fiction, spaghetti western, samurai film.  The after-the-end-of-the-world stuff doesn't come off as much different than what we've seen in dozens of films from A BOY AND HIS DOG through MAD MAX and this past year's THE ROAD - gray deserts, shattered towns and cities, little animal or vegetable life, dust, hopelessness.  The close-in fighting sequences feel like updated Kurosawa, and sharp-eared viewers will note that one of Oldman's henchmen whistles the theme from Sergio Leone's ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA at a couple of points during the film.  Denzel  is doing the taciturn, emotionless staring type of anti-hero best exemplified by Clint Eastwood in the "Dollars" trilogy, though he brings his own particular kind of charisma and even a certain warmth the role; he and Mila Kunis (somewhat miscast I think but trying her best and looking a bit too lovely in this grimy environment) are certainly the main reasons I saw the film and I can't say I was disappointed in them.<br /><br />Besides all the tough-guy stuff and macho posturing though, the film wants to be - and say - something more.  Problem is that in the resolution (which I'm not going to spoil for ya) that something more has to be taken so literally and absolutely for the film to work that if you don't want to believe it (and it IS a matter of belief) you'll probably just find it all laughable.  And the film doesn't play out for the most part as a comedy - it's a lot more serious than most spaghetti westerns, even solemn at times.  Then again, you could just have fun with Denzel doing Clint Eastwood, Steve McQueen and any number of other macho action figures and maybe that's enough.<br /><br />On a certain level, though, this film clearly wants to be taken seriously, wants to be something more than just a mindless action romp; the Hughes brothers who directed it haven't exactly shied away from Christian themes in their previous films, and here they are front and center and obvious.  You don't talk so much about religion - the Bible, specifically - if you don't have some kind of agenda.  But it's so damn muddled, and so careful to try to straddle various lines in order to have as wide an appeal as possible that I'm not sure it was worth it.  And in the final analysis, if this guy is carrying around a Bible and the message he's getting is "kill anyone who stands in my way", what does that say about the book, humanity, or this film?</p></body></html>

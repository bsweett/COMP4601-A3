<meta name="summary" content="Well worth seeing, way beyond a dumb PG-13 funny movie"></head><body><p>In this movie I like seeing a little different side of Adam Sandler he is more serious and had emotions. I was very surprised by this movie. Amidst the well written comedy scenes, there are many LIFE-IMPACTING conversations. If you pay attention to this movie, I think you will learn something about yourself, about cultural differences, about responsibility...all while having a few good laughs and a good time. (I know I sound like corney Dr. Phil). Go see this movie, I think Paz Vega is a stand out in her first big Hollywood appearance. her character could have lighten up she said no to just about anything, she won't let her daughter have $50, won't let her go to private school, she quite her job and moved out of the lovely house, she rejected Adam "which was stupid". Mrs. Leoni overacts and become quit bothersome. She's probable a CRACK-HEAD or RETARTED! The little latin daughter does a fine job at acting and she's very sexy "Salma Hayek" better watch out!</p></body></html>

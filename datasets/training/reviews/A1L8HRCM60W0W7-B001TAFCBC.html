<meta name="summary" content="BRILLIANT CONCEPT, SOMEWHAT MUFFLED BY GIDDY SCREENPLAY"></head><body><p>One cannot help falling in love with Kaufman's scripts for their sheer boldness and eccentricity, from John Malkovich to Adaptation. <p>The "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" is yet another maddeningly brilliant concept that'll make you sit up and watch, because it is scarily plausible and poignantly thought-provoking. Despite its psychological underpinnings, it is ultimately a take on love and how technology promises to break, mend, twist, and surprise our hearts and lives. <p>That description itself is reason enough for you to pick up a copy of the film as soon as you can and watch it! But unfortunately, the esoteric theme of memory erasure is dramatized with a 'different' but often unbecomingly scattershot screenplay. <p>In the end, I feel that the film comes across as being so self-absorbed in wowing viewers with a mozaic of doozy possibilities that it fails to fully connect with the audience. I would have done the movie differently but then what do I know. <p>I recommend this movie, at least once for sure, but just manage your expectations and enjoy the ride.</p></body></html>

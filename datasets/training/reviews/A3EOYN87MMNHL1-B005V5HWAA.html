Kevin Kosner is deft at playing the very sane serial killer who has a stellar regular life, marred only by an addiction that he is actively seeking treatment for through AA.  Wonder what the others in the support group would do if they knew his addiction was cold blooded murder.  William Hurt is also very good as the evil persona, his alter ego that eggs him on to do his evil deeds.  Good to see Marg Helgenberger in a movie role.  All of the twists and turns are very creatively crafted.  If you have not viewed yet, you will not be disappointed when you do.</p></body></html>

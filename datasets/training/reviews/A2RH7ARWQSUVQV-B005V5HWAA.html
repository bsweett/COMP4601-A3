<meta name="summary" content="Serial murder as an intellectual pursuit"></head><body><p>This is an interesting an intelligent movie about a man's obsession--addiction--for the thrill of taking human life.  Mr. Brooks, although prominent and successful, is otherwise an ordinary Joe.  Maybe a little too ordinary.  He is efficient, loves his family and is a mild-mannered, low keyed guy.  Unfortunately, he has an alterego in the form of a man, more forward and assertive than Brooks, constantly giving him dangerous advice.<br /><br />His advice is to give into his impulses, track down people and kill them in cold-blood.  Brooks does it, too, swearing each will be his last.  He doesn't enjoy it, he tells his alterego, but justifies it as an addiction.  Unfortunately, he is identified at the scene of one of his kills by a young voyeur.  This man, quite unexpectedly, blackmails Brooks into taking him along on a thrill-kill.  Brooks toys with the blackmailer, taking him along to scope things out and track people.  The younger man is frustrated.  He wants it now!<br /><br />Brooks, by now, fearing the humiliation of discovery is considering the possibility of suicide...maybe the young guy will help him out.<br /><br />As I said, it's a good movie but it's not fast paced.  Also, as an exposition of serial homicide it is not characteristic.  Almost all of these guys are serial sexual psychopaths.  They sexually abuse and torture their victims before they murder them.  Brooks doesn't.  I think this is cinematically explainable.  A graphic film of the 'average' serial sexual psychopath would necessarily be worse than hard core pornography.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite author of novels--"Skull Rack" and "Hummingbird God"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico</p></body></html>

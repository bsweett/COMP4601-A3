In fact, he's a real gourmet chef. Only one problem: he's a rat. Linguini, on the other hand, cannot cook. In fact, he's probably one of the clumsiest and most incompetent people you've ever seen. But he's a human, and a chef in a fine Paris restaurant has to be human, right? So Remy hides under Linguini's toque (Is that the word? His chef's hat.) and pulls his hair one way or another to direct Linguini's movements.<br /><br />The result is a fine adventure, a lot of unexpected plot twists, some incredible chase scenes, and a whole lot of fun.<br /><br />When I first saw the trailers for this movie, I was afraid they had given too much away; there would be no surprises. Boy, was I ever wrong! Remy is not only a great cook, he's completely adorable and a bit of a philosopher. There's one scene where his father tries to convince him that life is basically a war between the humans and the rats, and says "that's just the way it is, you can't change it." Remy disagrees. "Dad, life IS change!" he exclaims. So as he turns to go, and his father asks him where he is going, he says, "Hopefully, forward." And he is.<br /><br />I will probably play this movie until I've essentially memorized it. I truly love it. Five stars, no question.</p></body></html>

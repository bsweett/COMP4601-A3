<meta name="summary" content="The Action Kingdom"></head><body><p>The Kingdom is introduced with a concise history of the modern rise of Saudi Arabia and other notable Middle Eastern events. I found this to be an informative start to the film.<br /><br />There is action a plenty on offer, but this is generally bulging with clich&eacute;s and predictability.<br /><br />In terms of the narrative it is often far-fetched, yet it is still reasonably entertaining and provides plenty of shootout excitement.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W.

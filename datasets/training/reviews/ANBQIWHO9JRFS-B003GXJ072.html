It takes its sweet time gettting going, no doubt about it, but the cumulative effect is nothing short of astonishing.  Goldsmith's eerie, textured score, the creeping, endless exterior shots of the ship, the ugly, empty corridors within and the slow descent into the nightmarish alien ship.  All very effective and all before we're introduced to the Alien, which happens to be the finest film-monster of all-time.  The sense of reality of the whole operations is superior to just about any other sci-fi I've ever seen, and infinitely more realistic than the overblown, blindingly shiny and artificial CGI worlds of modern SF.  The Star Wars films may have brought SF into the mainstream and the A-movie class, but 'Alien' brought it down to earth.<br /><br />Performances are all first rate even if the characterization are a bit thin. (Well, Veronica Cartwright is pretty damned annoying, but she's believably annoying, anyway.)  Holm is especially good as secretive science officer Ashe.  'Alien' brings real world blue-collar workers into sci-fi and horror, and adds a greater weight and believability the the two genres by doing so.  On the downside, the film arguably lacks a strong protagonist, as Ripley is too cold to be excessively sympathetic, but the actual horrific elements are so good that the lack of audience identification with the characters doesn't much matter.<br /><br />A few minor concerns:  The alien is amazing... except for in his chest burster form.  Giger never had a final design for it, and you can tell.  As it is, the things kinda cute, and his scampering out of the  room is, shall we say, less than convincing.  Also, (SPOILERS) I've always been irritated by the shot of the Alien as he's about to grab Dallas, with his arms extended for too long.  Looks like he's leaping out at him at the beginning of a surprise party, not trying capture him and drag him away.  Finally, I don't like that Ripley goes back to get the cat.  I don't think it's sexist, as some sillier critics do, but it's a pretty damn inane complication, and frankly, I just don't buy it.  If she's gonna leave Cain to die out on the wind-swept planet surface just because he *might* be infected with something that *might* hurt them all, she sure ain't gonna face up to giant the monster that slaughtered the rest of the crew just to go get a cat.  She seems a lot more practical than that.  Still, that's it as far as flaws go.  It's pretty much perfect otherwise.<br /><br />As for the DVD, it looks amazing.  About as good as any film you'll ever see from the 70's.  Also, as you probably already know, the so called Director's Cut isn't really a director's cut.  Studio just wanted a new version to release, and so the original is both more correct to Scott's vision, and just better.  Still, it's worth watching once, just out of curiosity.<br /><br />Yeah, a brilliant movie, all in all.  Seen it probably 10-12 times over the years, and it still has a real effect.  It's got a certain shock effect that carries it the first time or two, but repeated viewings allow the sheer craftsmanship of the whole endeavour to display itself fully.  If you've ever enjoyed a horror movie, check out 'Alien'.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></body></html>

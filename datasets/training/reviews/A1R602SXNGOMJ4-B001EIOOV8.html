<meta name="summary" content="Scorsese does it again!"></head><body><p>Directed by Martin Scorsese, Casino is a story about Sam Rothstein, a professional gambler who becomes the boss of a mob operated casino in Las Vegas during the 1970's.<br />Ace runs the business and regularly sends lots of cold cash to his bosses. Helping Ace keep the casino's employees and customers honest is his best friend Nicky.  Although Ace aims to run a relatively respectable casino, Nicky wants to take over the entire gambling mecca. Then money hungy Ginger McKenna enters the picture, further complicating Ace and Nicky's friendship. She agrees to marry Ace even though she isn't in love with him and tells him as much. As drugs and alcohol become a bigger part of Ginger's life, Ace's possessiveness and jealously drive her into an affair with Nicky.  This is a must for all Scorsese fans!</p></body></html>

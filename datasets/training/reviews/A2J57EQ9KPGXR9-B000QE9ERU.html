This movie could have been 100 times better if:<br /><br />A. - The producer left John Travolta on his jet and picked somebody interesting to play the villain.<br /><br />B. - Explain Castle/Punisher's origin QUICKLY OR THROUGH FLASHBACKS. The whole "family killing" scene (What was Roy Schieder doing in this??) was not only off-putting but too long and unnecessary.<br /><br />C. - Kept Rebecca Stamos' on-screen whining down to a minimum.<br /><br />Things the Producer/Director got 100% right:<br /><br />1. Punny's costume and weapons (The compound bow was an excellent choice.)<br /><br />2. The ancillary villains: Honkey-Tonk guy and the Russian - interesting bad guys are always good.<br /><br />3. The actor who played Punny and most of his dialog - good choice.<br /><br />Some critics disliked the characters in the apartment but I have to admire the producers for taking one of the more interesting and recent comic storylines, that introduced these characters, and using it in this movie.<br /><br />The next Punisher film will hopefully be alot better paced than this one.</p></body></html>

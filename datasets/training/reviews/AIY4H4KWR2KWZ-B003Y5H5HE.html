<meta name="summary" content="Surprisingly Excellent Pond Crosser"></head><body><p>Quite surprising for an American director to create an excellent Euro-styled production. Filmmakers crossing ponds and finding success is very rare in my cinema experience, very rare.<br /><br />A pair of examples of how unusual and difficult it is: '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DRF84W">Hulk</a>' directed by Ang Lee. It sucked. And visa versa, '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016LTNL4">Death at a Funeral</a>' crafted by Frank Oz. Again, it sucked. These are highly regarded directors in their respective cultures - but translating that into a completely different cultural product is so very difficult. The style, temperament, and visual cues are often subtle and easily detectable if missed. And if not done correctly, will sink a film. Though to be fair, Lee's project immediately after the green disaster was a hugely successful movie.<br /><br />Point being: Few filmmakers can transfer and translate their abilities. Obviously Martin Scorsese is a member of that very elite club.<br /><br />Loved this film, and I was really impressed by wide-eyed newcomer Asa Butterfield, who played the all-important lead role of Hugo. So easy for a director to select a child actor who is inappropriate - either overrated or because they're simply incapable. Remember the atrociously plastic kid in the latter 'Star Wars' films? Or how about that ridiculously pretentious little prig in the recent stinker '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006PZBR8S">Real Steel</a>'? Lots of kids just don't have "it" - and surprisingly, many of them still somehow con their way into films. I'm honestly amazed that Scorsese was able to cut through the blatherskite and find the right performer.<br /><br />Butterfield has just enough universal appeal to forgive the fact that he, and the other artists, were speaking English. A tough sell given that almost the entire cast were from the UK.<br /><br />I have to think the French would've been happier if Scorsese had utilized an authentic Franco cast. Sadly, many in the US don't speak another language or are incapable of reading subtitles - so it's completely understandable from a marketing perspective. But from a creative angle, it's the one very minor failing of the production.<br /><br />A wonderfully rich story that I really enjoyed - with kudos to one of my all-time favorite actors - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UAE7KO">Sir Ben Kingsley</a>.<br /><br />Finally, I was surprised to read scathing jabs by social media mavens commenting on how sad and "wrong" it was that this film garnered so many Academy Awards when their favorites were iced out. I won't get into it other than - with age comes fine appreciation and wisdom. Hopelessly clueless blog yakkers and paid professional hacks, whose cinephile creds are based on less than thirty years of screenings, should shut the bleep up and learn the difference between populist tripe and cinematic excellence.<br /><br />More proof that '<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000K7VHOG">Idiocracy</a>' in action is an observable fact.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="THRILLER?"></head><body><p>Please stop calling it a thriller! Sure it has some of thriller's elements but it's a straightforward drama. If you read Dostoyevsky you'd notice that "Se7en" is very much alike his works. 'Cos it's about good and evil and how fighting evil sometimes can turn you into evil yourself. It's a message about violence which can't be stopped with another violence. When violence is directed against violence it ends up with... right, violence again. Vicious circle. And someone has to stop it. Detective Mills couldn't and that's why we feel so sombre after the end. Not because of Gwyneth Paltrow (you know what I mean).<br /><br />One more time we received an evidence that our world is chaotic, that it's not going to be a nice place, that it's violent and that even good intentions won't make it a better place. Forgive me my English but I assume they say: "The road to hell is paved with good intentions".<br /><br />"Se7en" is one of the most realistic and therefore depressive films of all time, it's a serious piece of art and by calling it a "thriller" people steel much of its value. And if you always considered it just a thriller watch it one more time, try to see what's inside and you'll be amazed at what you find.<br /><br />By the way this two-disc edition is one of the best DVD-editions ever. Audio and video transfers were remastered specially for this occasion, bonus features will take some of your precious time but you won't regret it. Definately a must-buy for anybody who likes cinema and purchases DVDs once in a while.</p></body></html>

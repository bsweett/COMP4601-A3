<meta name="summary" content=""King Arthur" - A Comedy Or A Drama?"></head><body><p>I don't believe director Antoine Fuqa meant "King Arthur" to be a comedy or burlesque. So, why was I laughing ten minutes into the film? The movie, about the Roman departure from Britain in the fifth century, and the subsequent invasion of the Saxon hordes, resembles a Hollywood historical epic extravaganza, circa 1960. The first battle scene did me in. The new bishop from Rome, accompanied by a contingent of mighty Roman soldiers on their way to their base near Hadrian's wall, are attacked by Woads, an army of Pictish freedom fighters in delightful blue body paint. Tattoo artists are going to make a bundle from this film! I watched in disbelief as the primitive Picts, on foot, slaughter the mounted elite Romans. Now these are the forces who conquered most of the known world. I don't think these fighting professionals pick-off more than 6 or 7 natives while they, in turn, are being slaughtered. Tell me that's not a rigged fight! Enter the Sarmatian calvary to the rescue, led by their commander, Artorius/Arthur. Suddenly the seemingly invincible Picts are slaughtered like canon fodder, (which has yet to be invented), by the newcomers. How could the Woads be so good one moment and so bad the next?? Talk about contrived! So, from this violent interaction, I concluded that the Romans were the bad guys, the Sarmatians the good ones, and the Woads indeterminate - because Arthur allows their leader to go free. Now, I loved "Brave Heart," "Rob Roy" was a good movie too, as was "Gladiator." Although Hollywood spectaculars in nature, these movies were believable enough for me to empathize with the characters. I had something to work with - someone to root for!<br /><br />Not to be picky, but as soon as the various fighting forces begin to parlay I began to giggle. The Sarmatians all have different accents - they sound like representatives from diverse parts the UK, and perhaps Australia. The Romans speak English with heavy Italian accents, and when the Saxons eventually speak their lines, their leader Cerdic, (Stellan Skarsgard) sounds like Joe Cocker with a cold. Their soldiers just grunt, but in different dialects. There must have been a worldwide casting call for this film. This is distracting! The dialogue throughout is too cliched to be campy - are you getting the drift? The plot is too predictable. I did like the idea of a revisionist Arthurian history, but David Franzoni's screenplay destroyed the credibility for me. There are moments of cleverness - but too few and far between. I was, and am, very disappointed.<br /><br />The Sarmatians, from the steppes of Central Asia, were conquered by Rome, and their sons forced as adolescents to join the Roman calvary for a fifteen year period. After rigorous training, a group of these impressed soldiers are stationed, with their leader Lancelot, (Ioan Gruffudd) in Britain, where they hang-out with local women, breed like rabbits, complain about the weather, gamble and fight the Woads, whenever they venture south of the wall. Their commander is Arthur, (Clive Owen), a man of mixed parentage, who was born and raised in Britain, is loyal to Rome, but also staunchly loyal to his men. And the Sarmatians are devoted to him.<br /><br />Arthur's knights - Lancelot (Ioan Gruffudd), Galahad (Hugh Dancy), Bors (Ray Winstone), Tristan (Mads Mikkelsen), and Gawain (Joel Edgerton) -- are about to return home to their families in Sarmatia after having fulfilled their 15 years of service. Their freedom is to officially begin the day after Bishop Germanius, (Ivano Marescotti), arrives. In this period, just before the Dark Ages, the Catholic Church rules in Rome through the emperor. The villainous prelate forces them to go on one last mission where they see, first-hand, examples of Roman cruelty and the brutality of the Saxon invaders, who are determined to take over where the Roman's leave off. These Nordic warriors show their stuff, amidst many more grunts, roars and bloody hacking during an action-packed battle on ice, which was a highpoint - much better and gorier than the Ice Capades. It is on this mission that they acquire Guinevere, (Keira Knightley), a Woadish nymphet who had been captured and tortured by the Romans in an attempt to convert her to Christianity. She is the cleanest one in the movie, and the prettiest, with a sexy, goth-style wardrobe and pouty lips. As a warrioress, she's good with a bow and arrow, and as a love interest, she sighs her way through love scenes with Arthur.<br /><br />Arthur and his band of merry knights decide to stay and fight for Britain, and join forces with Merlin, (Stephen Dillane), the Woad leader, to expel the Saxons. The rest is not history, nor even legend. Boo!<br />JANA</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the best mob movie's ever"></head><body><p>The definitive mob movie. Scorcese is the master of the genre. This is the way the real mob works, with the guys on the streets, not the man at the top. Masterful performances by all involved. Lorraine Bracco is gorgeous in this movie. Joe Pesci is never going to be cast as anything other than the character he plays in this movie, a wise mouth gangster. Shows a balanced account of the good and the bad about the mob.</p></body></html>

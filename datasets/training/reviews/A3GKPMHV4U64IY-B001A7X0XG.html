<meta name="summary" content="A World Unfamiliar"></head><body><p>While based on a comic book, the opening lines explain all you will know.  This is a word unfamiliar to you.  A disease had been adapted to make better soldiers.  It should have made them faster and stronger.  But it also made them short-lived.  Then the disease got out into the population and a war began between the infected, who were disappeared, and normals.  Violet was one of the infected.  She died.  She was revived.  She is now an almost unstoppable killing machine.<br /><br />Violet has been assigned to capture a new weapon that could wipe out all of the infected.  The weapon is not what it seems and Violet finds herself the protector of a young boy.  For the rest of the movie Violet kills huge numbers of people while trying to find out the truth about the boy.<br /><br />I have not read the comics so I don't know how accurate the movie is.  But without reading the comics I found myself completely lost.  Almost nothing in the movie has any explanation.  As the movie says, this is a world unfamiliar to us.  Unfortunately by the end of the movie we are still unfamiliar with it.  All we really have is characters, factions and other unknowns moving about through lots of action.  The viewer is left with many questions like why is Violet so much better than the others?  During the movie Violet seems to have two personalities.  One is the warrior strong and true.  The other is meek and unsure.  Again, no explanation and the transitions are almost jarring.  If you are familiar with the comic you will probably get a lot more out of this than I did, otherwise there seems very little point to the movie.</p></body></html>

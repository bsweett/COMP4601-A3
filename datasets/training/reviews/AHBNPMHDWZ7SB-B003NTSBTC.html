<meta name="summary" content="A Different Side of Scorsese"></head><body><p>Alot of people (both critics and moviegoers) were calling Shutter a middling, mediocre film when it first hit theaters. I guess when you compare it to Martin Scorsese's classic films, which have become some of the best ever made, it may seem that way. In my opinion, this is a damn fine movie. It does start off kind of slow, only at times. I have to say, I was pretty disappointed at how short Jackie Earle Haley's role was, considering he was one of the draws for me. I thought he would have a little more time at least, but he only had a brief cameo. That doesn't really matter because Leonardo DiCaprio completely owned this one. He was just fantastic. I've never gushed over any of his performances before (even though The Departed is one of my all-time favorite films), but there is absolutely no denying his talent in this one. His character covered every emotion that I can think of, and DiCaprio did a fine job at keeping us along for the ride. Actually, to be fair, the entire cast was perfect.<br /><br />Everyone from Ben Kingsley, to Mark Ruffalo. They all give convincing performances. There really is no reason for me to even talk about the acting. It was simply perfect. As for the screenplay. It was gripping. I don't read many books (except for graphic novels), but this movie made me seriously consider picking up the novel. Now I've read a few reviews for this movie, and complaints about the music being intrusive came up a couple times. Some people said that it was distracting at times. Well, I tried very hard to hear what they were talking about, but I didn't. I do have a couple of complaints though. I actually have the exact same complaint about this film, that I had about The Bad Lieutenant. Personally, I like it when nightmare and hallucination scenes appear real, but in Bad Lieutenant, and some of them in Shutter Island are obviously not. In the movie we are supposed to believe that some of the hallucinations are actually happening, but you can tell that they are not right of the bat. That's not my only problem with them. Some of the hallucinations (especially the ones we are not supposed to believe) are just stupid. Like why did we need to see a thousand rats on the cliff, or his wife turn to ash and crumble? That's just me though. That's probally a complaint that not too many people share. And it really isn't a major problem, because it was not an accident. It was just a directional decision that I do not necessarily agree with. Nevertheless, that did not ruin the movie for me.<br /><br />I'm surprised at how alot of critics and moviegoers are reacting so negatively to this film. It's certainly not a bad movie. Not in the slightest. Of course if you compare it to Scorsese's other films, it will not hold up. But if some rookie director would have been behind the camera, alot of people probally would not have been so harsh on it. I think this movie has one of the biggest, and best mind-effing end twists that I have ever seen, although it's not hard to see coming. It's still a must see. And the transfer, as expected from a modern release, is top notch. Beautifully translated to Blu-ray. The extras on the other hand are lacking. Very much so in fact, but that doesn't hinder this from being one of the better thrillers on the market. Highly Recommended!</p></body></html>

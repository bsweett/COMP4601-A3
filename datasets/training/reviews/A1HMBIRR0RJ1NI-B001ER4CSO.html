<meta name="summary" content="Hell Yeah!"></head><body><p>Deeper than the first, but admittedly great movie, "Hellboy", "Hellboy II" is right up there with the best of this genre breed, the last two Batman's, " Watchmen," & "Superman II!"<br /><br />There are so many great moments in this film it's hard to pick a favorite, but two come right to mind. The "Stars Wars" bar scene inspired "Troll Market," was just a plethora of far out characters in a far out world! I especially loved, "I'm not a baby. I'm a tumor." LOL! The other is the scene with Red & Abe, where they remorse over the loves of their lives while drinking beer. Both were hilarious in this scene, but Abe really stole the show here, but then again, when they both started singing along to Barry Manilow, it was a moment of pure comedic genius! I busted a gut on this one!<br /><br />Ron Perlman just owns every role I've seen him in, & this may be my favorite yet! That is not to say the cast was not uniformly excellent, as they were! I could not picture a better cast for this film, all had memorable parts, lines, & the acting was top notch, especially Luke Goss, as Prince Nuada! His determination to save his world, his obvious vulnerability for the love of his sister, yet willing to sacrifice her & himself for his cause, was quite a performance, though tragic, to behold! To bad I've not seen him in more films, though he was particularly good in "Blade II," as "Nomak" who spread the Reaper virus through out the Vampires. A role not unlike his in "Hellboy II."<br /><br />"Hellboy II" looks & sounds magnificent on Blu-ray! It's razzle dazzle special effects, it's beautiful palette of colors, & it's superior overall cinematography is a site to behold in high definition! The sound was deep & resonating!<br /><br />"Hellboy II" is a must for everyone's inner child fantasy!<br /><br />5 Stars = Masterpiece<br /><br />5 stars out of 5 = Masterpiece</p></body></html>

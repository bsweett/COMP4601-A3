<meta name="summary" content="Take me out of the ballgame..."></head><body><p>A baseball movie about the sports racket, and applying corporate concepts to picking players.  Director Bennett Miller manages to milk some suspense out of a foregone story, but it still boils down to a locker-room soap opera.  Pitt plays it with conceited ease, and the casting of lardass Hill and a wasted Hoffman is questionable.  There is some terrible pandering with hokey, maudlin scenes between Daddy and daughter (yuck!).  Typical of the genre inspite of what you may have heard.</p></body></html>

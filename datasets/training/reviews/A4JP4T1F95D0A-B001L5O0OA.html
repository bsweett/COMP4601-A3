This is an American film classic.  It certainly is not a perfect film, but it is endearing.  The settings are great, and it truly feels like you are transported back in time.  The acting is first rate all the way around.  The whole story revolves around little Ralphie's quest for a Red Rider BB Gun on Christmas.  Along the way we experience the Bully, the Leg, the tongue frozen to the poll, a scary Santa, the furnace, and the ultimate bad word among many warm humorous moments.  You can go wrong with this one.</p></body></html>

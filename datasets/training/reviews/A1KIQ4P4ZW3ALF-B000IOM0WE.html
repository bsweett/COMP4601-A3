The three consistent criticisms, from what I read, were that the costuming was poorly conceived and I would disagree somewhat given how difficult it is and historically has been to portray dress codes that far into the future so why not at least promote Charlize's physical attributes. Second, that the movie isn't faithful to the written comic book series is a common argument for all similar transferences from the printed page to the screen and most viewers regard that as a moot point as the mediums are, in the first place, so different and, secondly, how a story is expressed should be independent in the two mediums. Third, that the forest outside the city was poorly conceived and I say, so what, as the forest was largely superfluous to the main direction of the story.<br /><br />Digression aside, I principally look for creative storytelling in movies including the plot, the props, the sets, the cinematography, the editing/directing, the acting and this movie succeeded on all those criteria.  The story had a moralistic and intellectual theme; the props were visually period appropriate and well conceived; the sets were uniquely futuristic in design and function; the props such as Aeon's rotating eye and modes of communication were all interesting and novel; the camera work contributed to making this alternative dynamic world come across as somewhat realistic and the acting was solid enough. Finally, I noticed that the director's cutting edge work went a little under appreciated. So, director kudos, but a few years late, for delivering an entertaining and thought provoking futuristic action flick. It would have been interesting to have seen you continue your work in this genre.</p></body></html>

I know I know .... don't hold back ...<br /><br />This is a great story and the perfect vehicle for Will Smith to play the cool and world smart tutor for men who have no hope in the world of ever developing a relationship with a woman. Needless to say when he meets up with a hard as nails local gossip reporter all of his professional skils are tested to the limit ......<br /><br />This is definitely a 'date' movie or one could say a 'chick flick' but trust me it's a hoot and the viewer never really knows wher in the world the story is going ...<br /><br />It certainly has been a long time since I thoroughly enjoyed a great story, great movien and great acting ....</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Do you really not know about this movie?"></head><body><p>For those of you visiting Earth for the first time and who have no idea what this film is about, here is a review:<br /><br />"It's A Wonderful Life" begins in heaven, as angels discuss the sudden glut of prayers from the citizens of Bedford Falls, as they ask for help for George Bailey.  A man worthy of support from above, the angels decide to help George and dispatch Clarence, an angel in training, to do the job.<br /><br />The first ninety minutes of the film work as Clarence's (and the audience's) crash-course in George Bailey 101, as Clarence views the most important events in Bailey's life.  Clarence sees George as a little boy saving his brother's life and correcting potentially dangerous errors of his original employer, the town pharmacist.  As the young boy grows into an adult (Jimmy Stewart in the role for which he will most be remembered), George's life becomes one of compromise.  His dreams of seeing the world and a life of "importance" must be tempered and put on hold, as George settles for a job in his father's building and loan.  His friends and younger brother go off to exciting careers and fight in WWII, while George gets stuck in Bedford Falls and tries to convince the townsfolk to invest in each others' homes.<br /><br />Clarence comes in to George's life just as he has decided his life is a failure.  Wishing he had never been born, Clarence grants that request and lets George see Bedford Falls as it would be without George Bailey.  What follows is a declaration as to the power of the individual, as George gets to see how much his life changed the world for the better.<br /><br />Singed into our culture and as regular a part of the Christmas season as long lines at Wal-Mart, "It's a Wonderful Life" is the rare film that literally affects people's actions.  Almost everyone sees in George Bailey the humanity that we all can be and once dreamed of being.  The yearly viewing of this film reminds people of noble intentions they once had and the compromises we all make along the way.  I have no doubt that the night after this film is shown each year (usually the Saturday after Thanksgiving) people all across our country hit their pillows with goals and promises of doing better and doing more with their lives.  This little movie shows us all that we matter in the world, and that's a message we all need to hear from time to time.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="One of the best thrillers I've seen in a long time"></head><body><p>I haven't seen Ringu which this movie is a remake of, so I can only judge this movie.  Judging just this version of the story, I thought it was excellent...except for some unanswered questions.<br /><br />The movie starts out with a mysterious death which the aunt of the victim tries to investigate...but during the investigation process, ends up setting up her own fate to die.<br />Once her fate is set, each scene starts by giving you the date...a countdown to remind you her time is running out.  Besides that countdown being unnerving, what's also unnerving is that it doesn't seem like the aunt is accomplishing much each day.  She doesn't seem to be getting close enough to solve this mystery, which she needs to do because her life (and the life of her son) depends on her doing so.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this movie is very engrossing as she comes across each new and bizarre clue.  When she finally unravels the mystery, I thought it was a fascinating story, but also a little confusing, too...which is why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5.  I don't like it when movies leave me with unanswered questions.<br />I still give this a high rating, though, for the entertainment and shock value...especially at the end when you think the mystery is over, but it's not.</p></body></html>

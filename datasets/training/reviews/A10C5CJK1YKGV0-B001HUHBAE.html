<meta name="summary" content="Shame on the Academy ..."></head><body><p>No Spoilers.<br /><br />First, let me state for the record that it's a real shame that this film was completely overlooked by the Academy for 2007. Zodiac is easily the best film of the year. While it's just this one person's opinion, I know that many others feel the same about this film.<br /><br />David Fincher out does himself by creating a masterpiece that successfully shows the layman what used to happen in a Police investigation long before the days of everyone watching the intricacies of such on nightly television with shows like Cold Case, CSI and Law & Order.<br /><br />Clearly, the criminal justice system has come a long way, even in such a short time. What is really established is the short-comings of each department and with each set of Police Officers, who during their tenure, were actually good, solid investigators, but at the time had little communication between departments, counties and cities, which ultimately lead to the downfall of the investigation. It wasn't until Graysmith pulled all the facts, and of course some of his own, that a larger painting revealed what most likely occurred. Fincher does an excellent job at recreating each scene along the way, doing his best to be true the information and shedding light on new information that has been brought forward since then as well.<br /><br />Zodiac is a Police Procedural film in the truest sense and obviously covers the events of one of the most notorious serial killers ever to terrorize the minds of modern Americans. Mark Ruffalo gives a riveting performance as Inspector David Toschi and Jake Gyllenhal portrays Robery Graysmith, the cartoonist who became obsessed with the case and went on to write the most <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0425098087">widely read non-fiction best-seller</a> on the subject of the Zodiac.<br /><br />The attention to detail spent on the period is astounding and so far one of the best done for this period, the late sixties. It very easily puts Zodiac in a class of its own as a modern masterpiece which won't be easily forgotten, regardless of not receiving an award.<br /><br />One of the most impressive things about the 2 disc set is the documentaries that Fincher put together interviewing EVERYONE that's still alive and that was even remotely associated with the case. I can't remember any crime documentary where they went this deep and were able to lay everything out on the table for the viewers to decide. In my opinion, these documentaries are unprecedented and could've been sold as a separate documentary in its own right.<br /><br />I always listen to the commentaries on as many films as possible as hearing what the writer's and the director want to say and giving you their unadulterated two cents, really pulls you deeper into the film. The commentary on this 2 disc set is absolutely fascinating and worthy of the time spent listening.<br /><br />Lastly, I have to add that the telling of the angle on Don Cheney and his interview made my jaw drop and crash to the floor. I couldn't believe my ears listening to Don Cheney speak. He's still alive, he's out walking around on foot and probably equally as guilty as an accomplice. I was stunned listening to that information. But don't worry, nothing that you just read was in any way cumulative of a spoiler.</p></body></html>

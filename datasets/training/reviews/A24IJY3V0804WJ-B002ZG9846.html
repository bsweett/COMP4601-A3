In his quest he makes unlikely friends, takes on big foes but ultimately fulfils his dreams with the aid of other superheroes.<br />In short, this is a very enjoyable and comical movie with excellent direction. The movie's real star is the little girl played by Chloe Moretz. A lot of viewers have found her character and dialogue objectionable for an eleven year old, including the profanity but this is a movie and in my opinion should not be taken seriously. I loved the movie and cannot wait to see the second part. 10/14/10</p></body></html>

Christopher Reeve was the perfect choice to don the red, blue, and yellow suit, and Gene Hackman's campy yet hilarious portrayal of Lex Luthor is fantastic.  The special effects, while may look a bit dated, still look pretty good and hold up today.  This Special Edition DVD is worth noting as well, the screen tests are great to watch, and sometimes just plain hilarious.  All in all, even if you don't like the Superman comics, you will find something to love with this epic film.</p></body></html>

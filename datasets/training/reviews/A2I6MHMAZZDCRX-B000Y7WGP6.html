<meta name="summary" content="Good for a Jennifer Garner Fix, but That's about It"></head><body><p>There are very few actors who make a movie a must see for me.  Jennifer Garner is one of them, so I added this movie to my must see list.  Unfortunately, she wasn't enough to save this movie.<br /><br />When a terrorist attack takes place in a heavily guarded American compound in Saudi Arabia, Americans are incensed.  This is especially true for FBI agent Ronald Fluery (Jamie Foxx).  He wants nothing more then to fly over there and personally track down the men responsible.<br /><br />Since Americans were involved, the FBI is the logical choice to lead the investigation even though it is on foreign soil.  Unfortunately, the Saudis aren't interested in American help.  Their government doesn't want to look weak in front of their people, so they refuse.  At first.  But a few well placed connections get Fluery and a team of crime scene investigators sent over there for five days.  The team consists of agents Janet Mayers (Jennifer Garner), Adam Leavitt (Justin Bateman), and Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper).<br /><br />Upon landing, the team soon discovers that getting there was only half the battle.  The Saudis aren't willing to let them conduct any kind of investigation.  And the American consulate is more concern for the agents' safety then helping them accomplish their mission.  Will they be able to cut through the red tape?  Can they find the mastermind in just 5 days?<br /><br />I will admit I was a little wary of seeing this movie because of the subject matter.  I wasn't sure if this would be a political hit piece or not.  Fortunately, I found it to be evenhanded and the last couple of minutes will definitely start a few conversations, which is always a good thing.<br /><br />The acting was great, both from the well known American stars and the unknown Saudi actors.<br /><br />That's where the good parts end, however.<br /><br />I had some major issues with the stylistic approach the director made.  I get that handheld cameras are more "realistic" and are supposed to make us feel like we are really watching something.  All it does for me is annoy me and turn me off to a film.<br /><br />Additionally, there are multiple quick cuts, sometimes showing us a character for just a few seconds.  Between these two problems, I found it way too difficult to follow the movie and I even felt sick a few times.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie also has problems on the storytelling level.  Except for one of the Saudi characters, everyone else just felt like cardboard characters just doing their parts.  Granted, that might be because I had such a hard time following everything, but it was disappointing.<br /><br />Not that the plot was really that great.  I thought the idea of a CSI meets thriller had promise.  However, plot points and characters seemed to disappear at random, which left me scratching my head.  And the movie is rather slow for a thriller.  The first part is slow as the team cuts through red tape in Washington and Saudi Arabia.  The action picks up in the last half hour.  However, I was so detached by this point, it really didn't grab me like it wanted to.<br /><br />The movie was great for my Jennifer Garner fix.  Other then take, it was a real disappointment.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Went APE For This DVD"></head><body><p>I've seen all of the APES movies on television with commercials in my childhood.  The lovely thing about DVD is that my faded, scratched, spliced, and commercial-interupted memories of this film (and its sequels) are completely erased by a vivid, remastered version.  It's really a nicely made film.  I think the ape makeup survives today in this era of CG characters.  The story is solid.  I was surprised to see Rod Serling's name credited as one of the screenwriters!  I'd never realized this.  Then, as I proceeded to watch the movie, I began to see it as a feature-length TWILIGHT ZONE episode.  (*I mean this as a compliment!)  The movie introduces its human characters, strands them on a strange planet, then shocks its audience by revealing the apes 1/3 of the way into the story.  The film's final image is pure TWILIGHT ZONE, with an O. Henry twist to the whole story.  Brilliant!<p>The DVD looks great.  The sound is done well.  I wish there were more bonus items -- it's too bad that the APES documentary is only available by purchasing the entire set.  I'd love to get a gander at the makeup men and the set designers.  The look of these films is spectacular.<p>Watching APES again was a walk down memory lane.  Who would've known that Fox could get such mileage out of the APES concept!  5 films!  The original is the best.  And this DVD presentation does it justice.</p></body></html>

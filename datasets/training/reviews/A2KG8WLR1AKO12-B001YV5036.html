<meta name="summary" content="Cinderella Man: Red State Values Brought to the Large Screen"></head><body><p>The establishment critics did not like this movie.  Cinderella Man was deemed to be overly sentimental and idealistic.  They prefer anti-heroes and James Braddock is supposedly too perfect.  He does not cheat on his wife, drink until collapsing in a back alley---and the almost washed up boxer is a fairly observant Roman Catholic.  How corny can you get?  In other words, Braddock gloriously represents red state values.  Director Ron Howard never even throws a bone in the direction of blue state audiences.  Cinderella Man is simply not a movie for them.<br /><br />Braddock loves America.  He owes this country everything.  Bringing down the capitalist system is not a goal.  He does not perceive himself to be a victim.  The nearly destitute father of three blames no one in particular for his financial troubles.  Is he too old to ever again box effectively?  Will his often battered body be capable of enduring further abuse?  Is Braddock's return to the ring an example of real courage or macho recklessness?  Why doesn't Braddock possess more character flaws?  Can't he occasionally show evidence of existential angst?  Didn't they stop making motion pictures like this some sixty years ago?  The fight scenes are brutal.  Cinderella Man also reveals the suffering brought about by the Great Depression.  It should be on your list of must see movies.  That is, if you are a red stater.<br /><br />David Thomson<br /><br />Flares into Darkness</p></body></html>

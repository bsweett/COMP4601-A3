First he took his turn as Johnny Storm in two Fantastic Four films and now he's emerged as Captain America. (Supposedly he's contracted to "appear" in six movies)<br /><br />I think the biggest problem with this movie is the director. The only Joe Johnston movie I enjoyed was the perfect Rocketeer. I thought Jurassic Park 3 was a franchise-killer, Hildalgo - bleh. And nevermind The Wolfman.<br /><br />I thought it was great to do a period film when showing the origins of Captain America and staying with the original comics. However I found the pacing to be a bit off. I was actually bored with most of this movie. Every character seemed very bland. Even the fantastic Hugo Weaving was demoted to half-a-second moments.<br /><br />While I did enjoy this movie more than Thor, I'm not sure what I should expect from Marvel and their super hero movies anymore. If this was a tease of what's to come in The Avengers, I shudder.<br /><br />On the plus side, this does equal summer fun. There isn't anything questionable as far as content. I was just hoping for more super in this hero. Let's hope we'll get that in The Avengers and the next Captain movie.</p></body></html>

Night Shyamalan movie to his magnum opus The Sixth Sense, and yet more than with anyone else in the business, this is what happens to this man each time he releases a film. I told myself I wouldn't compare Lady in the Water to anything else, sat back and gave this one a chance, and I thought it had charm. I liked the feel to it, the colorful cast, and the way it leaped right into its tale without wasting time in explaining how this reality-shattering event came to be: in Shyamalan's hands it simply WAS. I don't regret buying this DVD and think if it's taken for its own merits, Lady in the Water is enjoyable.</p></body></html>

Rather than taking the easy road and making Queen Elizabeth and the Royal Monarchy a target, this film chose to show both the new (Tony Blair) and the old (The Queen) in a fairly impartial light. It is much more interesting to see how both sides learn and grow from each other by being willing to communicate and learn in what must have been an extremely difficult situation. Helen Mirren gives a miraculous performance and actually appears to be channeling Her Royal Highness. As Philip, James Cromwell portrays one of the few characters in this film who is thoroughly unlikeable. As Charles, Alex Jennings gives the portrayal of a Prince who has spent his life in a state of limbo, and seems to be ineffective both as a Royal Leader as well as a leader in his own home. Beautiful story, well written, and stunning performances, not to mention visual perfection. Get this film!</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="Great movie; not meant for kids"></head><body><p>The 5th movie in the Harry Potter series is again a great installment in this movie franchise.  As usual, the mood is darker than the previous movie, though we do have some true romance in this one.  The cast is big, as we have numerous characters from all the previous movies, with several new ones, both students and professors.  Alas this is the first movie without any Quidditch scenes, though this is more than compensated by some awesome broomstick flying thru downtown London.  And we finally have some extensive duels to the death between adult wizards and witches, with two of them forming the movie's climax.  Overall, a great movie.</p></body></html>

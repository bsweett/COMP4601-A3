<meta name="summary" content="...Intentionally Beats Up the Audience with Bellyaching Laughter."></head><body><p>Frequently the cinema world frowns upon slapstick, as it is a simple and unintelligent form of comedy.  However, Stephen Chow utilizes this variety of comic approach in his Kung Fu Hustle (known as Gong Fu in Asia) to perfection.  Slapstick finally finds its true purpose besides smashing pots and pans on top of people's heads, or pulling away chairs from seating people.  Chow takes it one-step further by inventing the new Shaolin Kung Fu style Slapstick, which willfully and intentionally beats up the audience with bellyaching laughter.<br /><br />"In a time of social unrest and disorder the gangs run amuck", is the opening description in regards to when the film takes place.  However, it is never clear exactly when, as periodically it feels mostly like the 1930s with moments from other time periods that are cleverly incorporated into the film.  The magic of cinema will remove the obstacle of time through Chow's creative fantasy approach and deliver a timeless journey into the small Pig Sty Alley where the story's heroes and crooks will converge in an epic comic battle of the kung fu fists and kicks.<br /><br />The Ax Gang rules the city while the police eagerly count their bribes.  The only ones that are an exception to corruption are the most unfortunate who reside in the poverty-stricken areas.  One of these areas is the Pig Sty Alley where this story unfolds when Sing (Stephen Chow) and his cheerful follower Bone (Lam Tze Chung) deceptively enters under the fake identity as Ax Gang members.  Sing's fraudulent plan backfires when the inhabitants of the Pig Sty Alley decide to oppose them, which pulls the real Ax Gang into the poor neighborhood as well.  Fortunately for the inhabitants of the Pig Sty Alley some very skilled kung fu masters have withdrawn from public attention into this poor neighborhood.  Thus, when the Ax Gang arrives, they are in for a surprise that will rock the corrupt society.<br /><br />The action is plentiful in Kung Fu Hustle to which some film critics has uttered dislike, but it is in the large amount of kung fu where the audience will discover an unpolished gem.  With the help of wire-fu, special effects and hilarious dialogues laughter will go through all its different gradients from muffled chuckles to full out laughing explosions.  It is within these fight scenes where the audience will uncover the crude jewel that ultimately will deliver a true cinematic gem through the admirable story line.<br /><br />Stephen Chow's story resembles a lot with Ren&eacute; Goscinny's and Albert Uderzo's comic book Ast&eacute;rix where one small village resists the whole Roman Empire.  The difference in Chow's film is mostly cultural, but it also has his own comic martial art touch to it.  There are also many spoofs on scenes from other films such as Matrix and some Spaghetti Westerns.  On top of the parody, Chow gives a full out slapstick assault to the kung fu genre that had its profound emergence in the 1970s.  Regardless of Kung Fu Hustle's similarities to other stories, Chow achieves an extraordinary film that delivers valuable messages such as forgiveness, honor, and love in the backdrop of a heavy dose of humor.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="The ultimate marriage of animation and culinary delight"></head><body><p>"Ratatouille" is Pixar's latest animated classic, and may be the best Pixar film yet.  Director/writer Brad Bird has created a paean to the artistic impulses.  His story revolves around Remy the rat, who is blessed with a fine palate but cursed by being born, well, a rat.<br /><br />Look for plot summaries elsewhere.  Suffice it to say that Pixar's animation has never been better, and both the kitchen of Gusteau's restaurant and the streets of Paris shine.  But the highlight of this film is its wonderful story, capped by a speech by food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole) about the flaws of being a professional critic and the struggle to create.  O'Toole's speech should have every half-baked film critic second-guessing every review ever written, but gives hope to every struggling artist - including chefs.<br /><br />The movie's theme inspires me to try to pair it with another, like pairing a fine wine with the right food.  I'm not sure what movie would make a better pairing with "Ratatouille" - perhaps Stanley Tucci's "Big Night," or perhaps "Amelie," or perhaps "The Incredibles."  The possibilities are endless, but the result would always be deeply satisfying.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="WARNING::I did not read the books, but I certainly will after seeing these extraordinary movies."></head><body><p>I thought that i would go ahead and and write a review on this since there are so many bad ones.  This is a story about Jason Bourne, some guys on a big fishing boat find him floating in the sea, and when jason wakes up he cannot remember anything about his life.  He can remember certain things like HOW TO DRIVE, and his bank account #, but can't remember simple things like his name.  So this leads to exciting event after event that leads jason to discovering  more about who he is and the people that are after him.  i could give you all the highlights of this movie, but I really don't want to give anything away.<br /><br />Overall a great movie with exciting stunts, fights, and chases.  But don't think that it is all about that because you will learn all about these characters and this movie keeps you interested all the way through, even the parts that are supposed to be slow.</p></body></html>

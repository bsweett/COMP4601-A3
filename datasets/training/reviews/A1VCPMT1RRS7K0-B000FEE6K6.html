<meta name="summary" content="Never get shot with your own merchandise"></head><body><p>The movie is introduced with a sweet CGI effect.  You are taken through a gun-manufacturing factory from the point of view of a bullet that ultimately ends up in the head of an innocent child.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage plays a russian under an assumed Jewish identity in New York.  He is surrounded by violence and he begins selling guns.  He continues to position himself increasingly deeper in the gun trade.  He gets his brother involved early on, but soon "loses" him to a dark side of the game.  His life becomes a mess, as he gets involved with drugs and his downfall begins.<br /><br />He goes against his better judgment and his sense of invincibility becomes weakness.  Just when you think the curtain is about to fall on our "hero", you are exposed to a piece of information that will blow your mind (kind of).  The fact that the movie is based on true events should be enough to sicken most Americans.<br /><br />This is a good movie.  It's very well done, although something about it makes it feel as though it's all been done before.  The narration reminded me of Goodfellas...</p></body></html>

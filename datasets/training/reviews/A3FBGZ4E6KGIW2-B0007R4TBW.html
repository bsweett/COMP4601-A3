<meta name="summary" content="Not what I expected."></head><body><p>I think Firedancer's review hit it right on the nail.  I read many reviews on this movie and saw the trailer prior to renting.  I thought this was going to be great with everything positive that I heard.  I was wrong.  Natalie Portman's character annoyed me.  All the characters lack depth, I was completely uninspired by the film's end.  I couldn't feel anything for any of them.  I am very disappointed in this picture.  I fell asleep during the movie and had to go back and watch the part I missed, so that speaks for itself.  I'm sorry, but I just can't recommend this.</p></body></html>

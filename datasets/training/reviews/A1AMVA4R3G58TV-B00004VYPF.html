<meta name="summary" content="Absolutely The Best Musical"></head><body><p>Signing in the Rain has to be the best musical ever. Debbie Reynolds is perfect in her role, and her voice is amazing. Gene Kelly is completely amazing, one of the most talented movie actors ever. And Donald O'Conner is just amazing. But Jean Hagen as Lina Lamont was my absolute favorite.<br /><br />This movie gave us great classic songs like "Good Morning" and "Singing in the Rain". This is a great fun musical. I completely enjoyed it.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="So, Is This Deluxe Version Worth Buying??"></head><body><p>The general consensus seems to be that it's a swindle and that Paramount is once again screwing the fans over.  I guess I half agree with that.  Some of the later films in the series have gotten decent treatments, and some are just outright hosejobs.<br />As far as this "uncut" first film goes, I'd say it depends.  If you have the first pressing that came out years ago, you might be interested in the bonus features depending on how hardcore you are about the series.  If you own the box set, I'd say not to bother.<br />First off, I don't really think it's totally uncut.  "Uncut" in this case is a few extra seconds tacked onto Kevin Bacon's death.  Not all that worth it if you ask me.  I know I've seen some cut scenes that showed a bit more of the gore effects, but I believe that was a European version of the film.  So no, I don't believe this film is truly uncut.<br />The bonus features-A short retrospective "Making Of" segment, which is interesting enough.  There's a n interview with Sean Cunningham, but he doesn't really say anything fans haven't heard before in other documentaries.  Then there's the Lost Tales From Camp Blood Part 1, which is a short segment of a fan made film that tries to mimic the style of the films.  Thankfully it's short coz it's not terribly good.  Then we have the commentary, and this is what pretty much sold me on this disc.  Unfortunately, it wasn't very good at all.  It's one of those commentaries where everyone recorded their parts separately, so there is no interaction.  Some folks might not mind this, but these kinds of commentaries really bug me.  Plus it seems as though none of the commentators are even watching the movie coz nobody ever comments on what is happening onscreen.  I would have liked to have heard more about particular scenes.  It's weird to think I watched an hour and thirty five minute commentary and really learned nothing at all.  In fact I hardly remember any of it.  The commentary is hosted by the dude who wrote Crystal Lake Memories, and he has a bad habit of continuously introducing the commentators before they speak.  You get really sick of hearing: "Adrienne King-who played Alice" before Adrienne King starts speaking.  A big letdown.<br />So, yes, I do believe that fans got the green weenie on this one.  It's really only necessary to purchase this if you don't already own it.</p></body></html>

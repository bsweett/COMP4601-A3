<meta name="summary" content="the best of the 3"></head><body><p>I thought that Spider-Man 3 was the best than the previous 2.  I'm glad that Toby did his best in this one as this will be his last appearance as Spider-Man.  Best of luck to the new actor who will replace him.<br /><br />In Spider-Man 1, I could not get over that metallic mask of the Green Goblin.  I mean, really!  In part 2, I guess I just wasn't fond of the whole Dr. Octopus storyline.  Anyways, you have to watch the first 2 in order to fully understand part 3.  But, even if you don't, you won't be entirely lost because part 3 will play some scenes from the first 2 as flashbacks.<br /><br />So, what's happening here?  Spidey is at his all-time high as the residents of NYC are loving him.  Life is just grand for Peter Parker/Spider-man.  He's in love with his girlfriend, Mary Jane Watson.  He's even thinking of proposing to her.<br /><br />However, things immediately go downhill once Mary Jane has been booted from a Broadway play.  She finds solace in Harry Osborne, who is suffering from amnesia, because Peter Parker is too "full of himself".<br /><br />Predictably, Spider-Man finds himself in trouble...not just with one villian but with three!  Venom!  Sandman! And the Goblin (Harry himself).  Plus, Peter Parker is slowly losing Mary Jane.  The question is, can Spider-Man fight them all simultaneously?  Can Peter win MJ's heart again?<br /><br />Anyways, Spider-Man 3 is a wonderful film.  I love how they've added humor at the appropriate time and place.  My favorite part was when Peter was bonding with the Venom symbiote.  He's physically aggressive but at the same time, overly confident with the women around him.  He does these silly little dance movements.<br /><br />Marvel fans can spot Stan Lee anytime, anywhere.  However, I cannot recall if he ever had a line as he had in this movie.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="There's a lot wrong with it ... but it's funny."></head><body><p>I could list all the problems with Wedding Crashers, from its generally formulaic story, to its decent, but entirely unimaginative directing, to a script that doesn't give the stars a heck of lot to work with, and, finally, to a blas&eacute; ending.  But, despite all of that, it has a number of geniunely funny moments, genuinely beautiful women of all stripes, and solid performances from Owen Wilson (who I generally like) and Vince Vaughan (who generally repulses me).  The two work well together, albeit with a minimal amount of chemistry between them, and the supporting cast members, including the always entertaining Christopher Walken, are a nice treat. (Will Ferrell's cameo performance was incredibly lame.  Or am I just getting sick of Ferrell's one-note schtick?)<br /><br />This a fun rump.  A guilty pleasure.</p></body></html>

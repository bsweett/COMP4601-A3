<meta name="summary" content="Rude, politically incorrect ... and funny!"></head><body><p>Although not as funny as "South Park - Bigger, Longer and Uncut,"  this is an entertaining spoof of action movies, with pointed jabs at both the jingoistic Right and the clueless, self-important Hollywood Left.  Production is quite elaborate for a puppet movie, with elaborate sets and lots of explosions. Definitely worth watching if you won't get offended by LOTS of bad language, fairly graphic puppet sex, and some equally graphic violence.</p></body></html>

<meta name="summary" content="An angel on his shoulder"></head><body><p>I admire Polanski for taking a broader look at the Holocaust, showing the divisions within the Jewish community in Warsaw and the help some got through the Polish underground.  Of course, it helps to have such a compelling figure as Szpilman to wrap this complex story around.  <p>One gets a very strong impression of the devolution of Jewish life in Warsaw, as Szpilman's family is forced to reduce itself to increasingly more appalling conditions. Polanski takes in a large panoply of characters, showing just how difficult the situation was for all those involved.  The Germans are by and large faceless officers who carry out random killings.  The Warsaw Uprising is touched upon.  Szpilman seemed to have an angel on his shoulder, able to keep one step ahead of the Germans.  <p>The situations are tense and unsettling but the film is perhaps a little too clean in terms of depictions and gives a little too glossy and account of the horrors of war.  Adrien Brody turns in a fine performance.  He seems to capture Szpilman's early disillusion and eventual degradation through the course of the war. Szpilman was a survivor, which contrasted sharply to the nihilistic views of his brother.</p></body></html>

This priest is buried alive without his "vital organs" ( I didn't know you could still be alive without your "vital organs").  Roaches or some type of bugs are, also, buried with him.  Remember the bugs.  This priest is inadvertently awaken and goes around trying to collect the vital organs of his human contacts.  One by one the priest acquires these "vital organs".<br /><br />This movie has the flavor of the Indiana Jones movies, music, characters, etc.  It could easily have been called "Indiana Jones and the Lost Sarcophagus, but that would have landed the makers in court for a copyright infringement.<br /><br />Highly recommended for the Indiana Jones aficionada.<br /><br />Gunner  December, 2007</p></body></html>

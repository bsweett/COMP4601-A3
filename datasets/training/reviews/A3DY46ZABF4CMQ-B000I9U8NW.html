<meta name="summary" content="...not all that fantastic after all"></head><body><p>The Fantastic Four is yet another Marvel Comics superhero story brought to the big screen.<br /><br />The four: Mr. Fantastic, The Thing, The Invisible Girl, and Human Torch, cause awe and wonder in the city of New York as they struggle to fight Doom and prevent him from taking over all the power of the world. It's cliched entertainment only past superheroes such as Superman, Batman, and Spiderman used the cliches to make up unique characters that inspired the audience, not bored them to death.<br /><br />The Fantastic Four are four scientists who, after facing an enormous flow of radiation, gain special powers: turning into a ball of fire, going invisible, extending limbs, and becoming a safeguarded body of heavy rock. The film focuses on the scientists trying to return to their normal selves, especially The Thing, whose wife literally divorces him because of his new condition, and suffers social isolation, instead of focusing on the foursome saving the world and fascinating us, the viewers, with demonstrations of their super abilities. Then there's the nemesis Doom, a scientist who was also exposed to the same radiation, whose power is to suck up energy and turn to solid metal.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the events as I mention them, The Fantastic Four is a silly movie. The plot and the subplots are not coordinated correctly. The Thing's wife never returns to him and there's not a care of trying to win her back either, and the entire love story between The Invisible Girl and Mr. Fantastic is pointless. The humor in the film is mainly from The Thing crushing everything he holds including a glass, a car, and a fork.<br /><br />The Fantastic Four is not all that fantastic after all.<br /><br />Not really recommended<br /><br />C-</p></body></html>

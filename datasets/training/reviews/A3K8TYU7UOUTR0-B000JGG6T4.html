<meta name="summary" content="Much more than expected"></head><body><p>I rented this DVD because I think Denzel Washington is worth seeing in anything. I thought I was in for a standard, well done, Hollywood action picture with a slightly shopworn premise. After about 30 minutes, I had high hopes for something more. By the closing credits I knew I had seen a great picture, many cuts about the average.<br /><br />The basic plot has a more-than-slightly burned out ex-agent (Washington) hired to protect the daughter of a wealthy businessman during a wave of child kidnappings in Mexico City. Despite the initial coldness of the agent, he develops an emotional attachment to his "client." This basic outline has more than a little moss on it (The Bodyguard, The Transporter, The Professional) and the results have been mixed at best. The nature of the story lends itself to the sort of generic sap that Hollywood producers settle for to please the widest audience possible. Man on Fire, for several reasons, seems almost like a new species of action film. There is an edge to it that I haven't seen in a mainstream film in a long time.<br /><br />Director Tony Scott has produced a dark, taut film that is almost skeletal in its hardness. The images come at a breakneck pace, and not one of them seems clich&eacute;d or standard. The scenes and shot selection seem almost random, until you realize that the overall effect has been one of great power. The director has chosen a somber tone, completely unromantic, and it fits the story beautifully.<br /><br />The writing is excellent throughout. No long speeches, no fluff, and everything sounds painfully true to life. I never had the feeling of any of the actors laboring with a line, or delivering a painful "clinker," where it's clear a writer somewhere was patting themselves on the back for a line that is impossible to deliver without posing.<br /><br />The real triumph of the film, though, is the acting of Denzel Washington. This guy just gets better and better. How many films have you seen where the main character was supposed to be "burned out" but in fact looked, well, like a Hollywood actor - young, well fed, and at worst maybe a little artfully sullen? Think Tom Cruise trying to act like a world-weary ex-soldier in The Last Samurai. Well, Denzel Washington looked truly burnt, both physically and spiritually. He seemed really to be a slightly jittery, slightly ragged shell of a man. In short, he creates a character of great depth, and every move is believable. Importantly, when the movie turned to violence, his character was without the politically correct "misgivings" so many action film leads suffer with, and his attachment to his client was developed beautifully and completely believable.<br /><br />I bought this DVD the day after renting it and plan to watch it again when it is delivered. This is one that will stand the test of time, as well as many repeat viewings. -Mykal Banta</p></body></html>

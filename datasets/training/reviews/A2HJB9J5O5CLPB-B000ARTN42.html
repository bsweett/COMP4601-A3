<meta name="summary" content="No Academy Award?"></head><body><p>This film didn't get a nod for the Academy Award in 2005.  The reason, many reasons, but I might sum up Liberal Hollywood's aversion to a conservative manly man, succeeding against all odds in a tough world isn't the same as two less manly men, Truman Capote, race obsessed cops, or an effeminate Transsexual whining about America run by gasp, Bush!!!!<br /><br />Those warm sepia toned 1930's are recreated for us by Ron Howard. Not much fun starving to death is there?  Yet Crowe's Braddock, an injured fighter working the docks to support his family, he doesn't cry.  He does what he has to do without stealing or sniveling.  He is forever optimistic despite all setbacks.  He is a beacon of light for his hungry family.  This is undoubtedly the Story of Seabiscuit on two legs, but because we are dealing with one of the best film actors in the world, we can empathize readily.<br /><br />Forget Rocky, CM has fine fight scenes. Sure, they are choreographed, but who cares.  We really hated Max Baer and Braddock handles the fool, no prob.  Thanks for the uplifting, Conservative message, Ron.</p></body></html>

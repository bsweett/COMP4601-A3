<meta name="summary" content="Where's Alonzo?"></head><body><p>During the entirety of "American Gangster", the story of legendary scumbag Frank Lucas who ran the Harlem Mafia for 20 years, I wanted Denzel Washington to stop acting princpled, gentlemanly, professional and revert to "Training Day" mode.  Nostalgia for his monstrously depraved, charismatic dirty cop hit me in waves, particularly when he was conversing with Russsell Crowe at the end of the movie.<br /><br />Altogether, this is less an attempt at an honest portrayal of what the brilliant drugdealer was like than an attempt to create a "black Godfather".  Lucas is not the guy for this and despite Denzel Washington's superb acting skills, one cannot turn a heroin dealer from the ghetto into Marlon Brando's Don Corleone with this cast lineup.  The supporting actors are not there and the film moves too fast from nightclub to nightclub, sporadic murder to murder, betrayal to betrayal.  Crowe's Richie Roberts, a cop who did what he was suppposed to do at a time very few others were, has said that this movie is only "20 percent" true. In Frank Lucas' own words: "They should have never made a movie about me."<br /><br />Washington's Lucas is too evasive to really grab a hold of.  He is a bad dude, that much is clear: when a particularly nasty rival challenges him to shoot "in front of everybody" on a Harlem streetcorner, he obliges.  Washington's performance is so compelling that one wants to know more about Lucas--where did he come from, why did he end up with Bumpy Johnson, why is he such a tough guy, and what are his motives for even being in this business? But the flash and glitter of the film allow for no such answers.  What is clear is that Lucas is simply another capitalist in many ways.  When a rival by the name of Nikki Barnes cuts the purity of his infamous "Blue Magic" down for no apparent reason, Washington visits him and says: "Blue Magic" is like "Pepsi".  Okay?  I stand behind the product, and it's fast selling."  Lucas may not even see what he's doing as evil.  It's simply the way he makes money and it's very successful.<br /><br />This is movie is basically a testoterone rush and as that it works very well. I'm still waiting for Alonzo to return in "Training Day II".</p></body></html>

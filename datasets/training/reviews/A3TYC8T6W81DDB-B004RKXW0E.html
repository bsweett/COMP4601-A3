Not many people can claim that there isn't at least one Pixar film in their delightful repertoire that they don't feel strongly about or hasn't moved them in the slightest. But as much as I adore Pixar and as admirable and enjoyable as Toy Story is for introducing the world to a wonderful animation studio, I didn't love the first two films quite as much as most do. I was under the impression I'd feel the same way about Toy Story 3, but luckily I was wrong.<br /><br />Something has to be said about the "Day & Night" short that played before Toy Story 3. It was spectacular. Pixar has always been fantastically imaginative anyway, but "Day & Night" is one of the most original animated shorts I've ever had the pleasure of sitting though. A truly brilliant piece of animation.<br /><br />My mom used to make a career out of making and selling teddy bears, so toys, action figures, and stuffed animals have pretty much always been a part of my life in some capacity. It seemed like we'd always find her bears in spots where we didn't leave them and in positions we didn't remember leaving them in, so we came up with this story that they were alive and would throw parties when we weren't in the room. Everybody played with toys growing up and that's one of the reasons why the Toy Story films are so easy to relate to. Toy Story 3 makes you realize how much you love these characters you've been spending the better part of 15 years getting to know. You don't want to see their adventures end. The fact that Pixar is capable of making its audience care so much about CG animated characters that are made of plastic or whose insides are nothing more than stuffing is extraordinary in itself.<br /><br />Toy Story 3 not only lives up to the first two films, but surpasses them entirely. The third film throws you into this ingenious world where you're just immersed in originality and creativity. Not that the first two films didn't already establish that, but you lose yourself and get sucked in much quicker this time around.<br /><br />Toy Story 3 may not just be a movie of the year candidate, but it might be the most satisfying third film in a franchise ever. It manages to introduce new characters that you grow to care about by the end of the film while effectively ending the story between Andy and his toys. The sequel lives up to Pixar's reputation for being incredibly moving and heartfelt. Toy Story 3 has everything and appeals to all ages. I'm going to go on record as saying that Toy Story 3 is the best Toy Story film to date and easily the best film of the first six months of 2010.</p></body></html>

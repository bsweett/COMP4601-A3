<meta name="summary" content="" I have spread my dreams under your feet. Tread softly because you tread on my dreams""></head><body><p>I remember clearly in 2002 I saw a trailer for this movie, somehow no one recalls this movie. I on the other hand could not wait for this movie to come out, I actually went to the cinemas to see it...unfortunately it had been taken out already. Anyway, I saw it as soon as it was released on DVD; and let me tell you that when I saw it for the first time it blew me away. The Story, the Acting and the out of this world action sequences.<br /><br />Now 7 years later...It didn't feel the same, the movie however still stands as an exceptional Sci-Fi film, but not as superb as I remember. The problems with the movie are mainly "plot holes" some are passable and others are as big as the Milky Way.<br /><br />The movie's premise is of a world commencing from start after a 3rd World War. According to the brief prologue we are supposed to accept that there is only one last remaining "civilized" society, known as Liberia. In Liberia, every citizen must take a doze of a drug known as "Prozium". This drug inhibits the effect of a robotic/non emotional being. So technically speaking no one can or exhibit emotions..."why"? well according to the story of the movie, emotions like hate, greed, and anger caused War. Yet without Emotions we seize to exist as humans beings, it is an essential part of who we are.<br /><br />shortly in the movie we are introduced to John Preston (Christian Bale) a "Grammaton Cleric" (futuristic officer) he exhibits the persona of a man troubled by lost of someone and himself, his emotions that have been repressed are demonstrated quite well in dream sequences and thoughts. As for what happens...Its quite obvious, he accidentally lets the dose fall on the floor...And voila he begins to "feel"<br /><br />So, pretty much the movie is interesting and contains a potential plot. "So what's wrong with it"? Unfortunately the problem with the movie is the plot holes. As I had said these plot holes are quite noticeable. I will write a short list of some of the most obvious mistakes. Anyhow, the movie borrows alot from Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, and even the city looks similar to Fritz Lang's "Metropolis.<br /><br />Now, all of these mistakes are not to be taken as a reason to ignore this movie; on the contraire, this movie has still so much more to offer. The astonishing "Gun Kata" the technique to fight with guns blew me away, it is by far the most original idea I have ever seen in an action movie. Not one scene involving the "Gun Kata" looks bad. The best asset in the movie is Bale, he brings so much to the role, he takes the Semi-Original story and gives it heart and a push that made the film a sleeper hit.<br /><br /> This is a sci-fi vehicle at the most, but don't underestimate the directing of Kurt Wimer (who unfortunately directed a weaker film "Ultraviolet) he directed this movie so well for so little money. The entire cast gave a little to the story so we could forget in a way the mistakes in the movie. As well the sets and wardrobe are amazing, Preston's white suit, which resembles the morning suit of Bruce Lee in Fists of Fury, Gives a certain shine to action, it pretty much gives a splendor. With its Mistakes it still worth owning, classic modern science fiction at it's best.<br /><br />Some of the Mistakes<br />***Warning Spoilers Ahead***<br />1) Preston at the end can somehow dodge 1,000 of bullets and still kill everyone with out a scratch.<br />--POSSIBLE EXPLANATION-- Preston is the highest ranking officer, he is pretty much the best...but still come' on..Way to precise<br /><br />2) Partridge is reading a book of Yates; earlier in the movie it's much smaller<br />--POSSIBLE EXPLANATION-- The angle in which we see the book the first time makes the book look tiny...hey it can be possible<br /><br />3) The character of Brent smiles all the time...Supposedly he takes the dose<br />--POSSIBLE EXPLANATION-- Brent could have not taken the dose at all or his smile is a senseless smile..a soulless smile<br /><br />Trust me it goes on and on with plot holes...but it still has alot of heart and potential. The vest is the acting and not to mention the music, which soars so triumphantly. Too bad there isn't a soundtrack. Anyway as I said, It's a must have even if it has mistakes.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 ? OUT OF 5</p></body></html>

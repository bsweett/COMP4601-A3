Night takes a rather artful approach to filing somebody dieing. Of course, that rather artful scene could be the only one of the movie, as it's a stark contrast to a later scene where a man purposely feeds his arms to a group of lions. It's not bad in of itself, it just comes out like a Monty Python sketch. And this would be the story of the movie. At times it's well-done, and at times it's laughable.<br /><br />Example, the marriage troubles that's the unfortunate subplot of the movie involves the wife feeling guilty, acting like she's cheated on her husband, come to find out she only had cheesecake with him. It's at this fact, that the husband feels lied to and betrayed about. To this, he responds by conjuring a story saying he was so attracted to a pharmacist, he bought cough medicine, even though he didn't have a cough. The wife is horrified at this fact, until the husband reveals he was kidding. Yes, this subplot is pretty bad, but also delightfully cheesy.<br /><br />The Happening happens to be an attack of plants on humans by releasing a toxin that makes anybody affected to kill themselves via any means. Why are the plants doing this? Because we're poisoning our environment, which is the real horror in this movie. It's incredibly cheesy, and entertaining, even though it could have been carried out better in terms of plot/action. I mean, if NYC is killed by plant toxins, that's going to set the nation back quite a bit, not to mention the massive loss of life. Also, don't try to figure out the logistics of the toxin, or how it works, because you will be confused. It kills people in large groups, then kills a singular people without explanation.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg has seen better roles, however he carries possibly the film's funniest/cheesiest moment when he finds himself talking to a plant, trying to convince it that he means them no harm, and he only wishes to go to the restroom, come to find out the plant is plastic. With scenes like this, I'm even surprised he took the role. Zooey plays the wife who likes to keep her feelings inside, even though Zooey is known for being that energetic indie girl. Besides the fact that plants are makes people kill themselves, Zooey is still the highlight of the movie.<br /><br />Seen as the cheesy film it is, M. Night Shyamalan's first R effort is entertaining, but the type of film you'll only want to see once. Why is it not to the par of other M. Night films? Because he's purposely trying not to be himself, which kind of hurts the movie, but helps give the film its cheese. So what is the happening? The cheese is what's happening.</p></body></html>

I loved Night of the Living dead so much, that when saw this one at my local video store I went nuts. George Romero is a genius; even my 9 year old mind could see that. The whole plotline where the dead suddenly rise and want to eat the living and a group of survivor's hole up in a mall couldn't have made me happier, a whole entire mall as your house? what? YES! The makeup and special effects were sub par, blue tint and Hare Krishna's, but I still wouldn't have wanted them near me. I understand now as an adult the social commentary Romero was making, but beyond all of that his movies are just plain fun. No one has ever been able to touch his writing ability, his characters, his locations, and his zombies. No One. I even picked up the soundtrack featuring The Goblins, I still hum the music when I go to the mall. My favorite Zombie in this movie has to be the Nurse, she actually was spoken to by Romero for being "too over the top" with her flailing and facial expressions, just watching her Zomb-out cracks me up. My favorite character is "Fly Boy" the pilot, in his suave jacket, slick hair. Throughout the movie he is just a wimp, he cannot shoot, he isnt reliable to his pregnant girlfriend, he does the wrong thing at every turn BUT when he finally is eaten in the elevator he turns into the biggest badest nastiest zombie who has retained important knowledge and who is given the best makeup treatment to boost the importance of his change. Fly-zombie twitches, and bends his neck, and lurches around gathering the other clueless corpses upward and onwards to the secret hiding place of his hopeful buffet, the ending is classic romero and everyone who loves him will know what i mean. I only watch this maybe once a month now, I will pop it in when I am cleaning , or when I am home sick and need comforting. I realize that my warped mind has now equalized zombies to chicken soup but I give no apologies for it. SO buy this movie, relish it, eat it up, forgive it for being outdated a bit and cheesy at times, see it for what it is, THE single greatest zombie movie of all time.</p></body></html>

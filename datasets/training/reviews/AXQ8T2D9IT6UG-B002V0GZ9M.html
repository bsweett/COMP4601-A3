If you want to enjoy it, you must forget about logic, and be ready to overlook quite a few inconsistencies in the plot. Provided that you do exactly that, you will enjoy an engaging and thoroughly delightful romantic movie that will leave a smile on your face.<br /><br />From my point of view, the main theme of "The lake house" is the existence of a soulmate for everybody, and whether we are ready (and able) to wait in order to meet the person that completes us. Kate (Sandra Bullock), who along with Alex is one of the two main characters of this movie, asks herself the question everybody has asked himself at least once, "What if you live your life and no one is waiting?". I suppose the only valid answer is to have hope, and go on searching.<br /><br />But I digress... I would like to point out that for Kate and Alex (Keanu Reeves), the problem of meeting their other half is even more complicated than for us. You don't believe me? You can't conceive of someone with more problems than you in your search of the "right" person? Well, you should take into account  that Alex Wyler and Kate Forster have our same problems, but also need to struggle with the fact that they live at the same place, in different years. And yes, you read that well, but please remember you need to suspend your disbelief for the duration of this film, if you want to enjoy it.<br /><br />The way in which Alex and Kate get in contact with each other, and fall in love, is strange, and whimsical. It doesn't make sense, but... when did logic become an obligation? "The lake house" is a magical movie that entertains, and can completely charm the right spectator. Are you that person? Are you interested in their story, and on whether they will overcome the obstacles before them in order to be together? If that is the case, just rent or buy this movie.<br /><br />All in all, I can say I really liked "The lake house", and I highly recommend it to those that like romantic films, and don't feel uncomfortable when fiction doesn't follow reality closely. This movie is not for everybody, but if you know what you are getting into and still decide to go ahead and watch, you will love it.<br /><br />Belen Alcat</p></body></html>

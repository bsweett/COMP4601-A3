Tommy Lee Jones plays the same lawman he's done at least a dozen times before. Intense violence marks this chase movie which, in the end, doesn't tell us much, despite attempts at seeming important and ominous in some way. Set in 1980, the soundtrack of the times is missing, though the cars look right. The end is extremely anti-climactic, which may be one reason this got so much praise. I'm inspired to check out the literary work on which it's based. Never heard of Bardem before, but he is great here, very spooky.</p></body></html>

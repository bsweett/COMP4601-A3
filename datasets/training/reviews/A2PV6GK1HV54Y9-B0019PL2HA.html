Will Ferrell continues with his zany antics as usual but the performance that surprised me the most is Leslie Bibb who plays Ricky's over-zealous wife. Bibb is hilarious and shows range I didn't know she had since mostly she does t.v. work. John C. Reilly also flexes his comic timing and while the film has some embarrassing moments, Talladega Nighs did make me laugh. You will either love it or hate it, good luck!</p></body></html>

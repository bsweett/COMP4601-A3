I admit I was a little uncertain about the portrayal of our beloved hero by the relatively new actor Brandon Routh, but after I saw it, all fears were laid to rest.  Kevin Spacey also did a splendid job as Lex Luthor.  I honestly have no complaints about this movie.  This time around, the filmmakers showcase Superman's powers better than ever before (at least partially due to advances in filmmaking).  You really get the idea that Superman is the king of all heroes, with a heart of solid gold.  He is truly worthy of leading the Justice League (also fiction, I know, but what's wrong with a little fantasy?).  This movie is a real treat, and a very moving experience.  If you are a fan of superhero or action movies, this movie belongs in your collection without a doubt.</p></body></html>

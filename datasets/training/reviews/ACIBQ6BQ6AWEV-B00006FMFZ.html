<meta name="summary" content="Elegantly Made But Unexpectedly Superficial"></head><body><p>Based on the graphic novel by Max Allan Collins, which was in turn based very loosely on various factual stories of the 1930s, THE ROAD TO PERDITION tells the story of Michael Sullivan, a family man and thoroughly nice guy who also happens to be an enforcer and hit man for the Irish Mob.  Sullivan strives to keep his homelife separate from his work--but son Michael Jr. precipitates disaster when he follows his father and witnesses a murder.  Determined to both protect his son and have revenge on the mob boys who have suddenly turned on him, Sullivan goes on the run with Michael, and in the process finally "finds his heart" through his determination that young Michael will never walk his road.<p>There is a great deal to like about this film.  The cinematography is astonishingly beautiful and extremely well supported by the editing, which is among the best I've ever seen, and the soundtrack, which lends the story a meloncholy depth.  Many of the cast members are also exceptional, most particularly Jude Law, who creates perhaps the most chilling killer seen on screen in a decade.  But the film has two significant problems: the plot and the star.<p>There are several issues with the plot, and the overwhelming one is its predictability.  There is nothing new until one reaches midpoint, when Sullivan--with the assistance of his son--attempts to force the mafia to permit his revenge via a series of bank robberies in which he takes only mafia money.  This was quite an original idea, and very intriguing, so I was doubly frustrated when the film took yet another predictable twist that effectively negated that rather large chunk of film time.  The other issue here is Tom Hanks.  Hanks is an extraordinary actor, and the role of a hitman seemed a unique opportunity for him to blow off the super-likeable parts for which he has become famous.  But instead of doing this, Tom Hanks essentially gives a standard super-likeable Tom Hanks performance, and I found it increasingly difficult to believe him as a mob enforcer, much less to give his drive for bloody revenge any creedence.<p>When all is said and done, what is left is a film that essentially holds you by virtue of sheer cinematic technique.  THE ROAD TO PERDITION has an amazing sense of style and creates an amazing visual portrait of the era, and that--along with such performers as Jude Law--held my interest to the end.  But far from "finding its heart," the film is hollow, a matter of style over substance, and I found the story obvious, the conclusion foregone, and the statement commonplace.  While I did enjoy the film, I do not expect to revisit it.  As for the DVD itself, it is a nice package, with the visual and aural elements extremely well done; I found the bonus material, however, as bland in content as the film itself.  Now, this film has garnered many fans, and I say if you can get something out of it, more power to you, and it will be well worth the investment.  But at the same time, I would suggest that you rent this one before you purchase it, for you may just as easily fall into the other catagory--in which case you'll consider THE ROAD TO PERDITION barely worth the trip.</p></body></html>

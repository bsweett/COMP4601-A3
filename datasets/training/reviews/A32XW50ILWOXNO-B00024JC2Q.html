<meta name="summary" content="Stiller & Wilson can't save this lame, tame & stale flick"></head><body><p>"Starsky & Hutch" should be the final chapter in the Ben Stiller/Luke Wilson buddy picture collection. They've worked every angle of the pairing that pits the neurotic, six-cups-of-coffee Stiller persona (Starsky) against the "What, me think?" Wilson persona (Mike "Hutch" Hutchinson). By the close of director Todd Phillips' third consecutive financially-successful-yet-uneven comedy - think Ivan Reitman meets P.T. Anderson - even Stiller and Wilson seem sick of each other; the movie is stolen with or without their permission by Snoop Dogg (as Huggy Bear) and Will Ferrell (as an imprisoned gay biker with a dragon fetish.)<p>The script, co-penned by Phillips and writing partner Scot Armstrong ("Road Trip" and "Old School") installs a mustached Jewish businessman, Reese Feldman, as the drug villain, played by Vince Vaughn straightaway, without humor. He shoots a guy in the movie's opening scene, blows up Hutch's shack in another. Feldman's discovery: a hybrid cocaine undetectable by German Shepherds and crime labs - watch for an inside joke about "new" and "old" coke - which plays a role in an extended sequence where Starsky mistakes it for sugar.  <p>Phillips and Armstrong poke a bit of fun at the 70s - the original TV show emerges mostly unscathed - by parodying disco, cheerleaders in the Farrah Fawcett hair, the pimp culture, punctuated by Snoop Dogg - but they generally rely on Stiller and Wilson to goof off one another. It's debatable whether their chemistry has ever been that good - "The Royal Tanenbaums" wisely kept them apart - but here they struggle in dead air. For Stiller it could be fatigue - seven films in calendar year plus a regular spot on "Curb Your Enthusiasm" - and for Wilson, it could be the epiphany that there are more roles out there than the shaggy, shambling fool.<p>"Starsky & Hutch" seems strangely lobotomized. A scene, for example, that features Starsky and Hutch interrogating a topless cheerleader (Molly Sims) might have earned an R rating shot from the front, but at least we would have been spared a viewing of the skeletal Sims' alien spine. Robbed of their ability to rip off "Porky's" by Hollywood bean counters looking for a franchise, Phillips and Armstrong fall back on the PG-13 comedy standbys - casual drug use, slightly loose women, homophobia, and two household names and a handful of cameos ( Snoop Dogg, Jason Bateman, Chris Penn). It's not unlike one of those failed Saturday Night Live comedies: too tame in one scene, too lame in another, stale most of the time.</p></body></html>

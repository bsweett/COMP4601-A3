<meta name="summary" content="A nice little family drama, but a real downer"></head><body><p>This is not a happy film, and there is no Hollywood-esque upbeat ending. As such, this family tale is not likely to be a big hit. Clooney's intelligence in his choice of films is obvious, and this one is a cut above most Hollywood fare. It's a film about dysfunctional people. The mom spends the entire thing in a coma, looking more and more corpse-like. Great acting there! The kids are better than usual. Actually, the best thing here is the soundtrack of genuine Hawaiian music. I'm going to look into getting it. It is great.</p></body></html>

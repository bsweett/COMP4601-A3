J Jonah Jameson is also perfectly done. Not so happy with Mary Jane; she's too wimpy here, while a real tiger in the original comics.<br />But, this is a movie with its own agenda, and it fulfills that well. Good job on making Doc Ock believable; Molina is solid.<br />All in all, worth watching for pure comic book-style fun.</p></body></html>

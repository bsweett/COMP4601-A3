<meta name="summary" content="Mayan Adventure Film"></head><body><p>Sometimes its hard to separate a movie from the actions of its creator.Mel Gibson's Apocalypto is such a film. Many of the poor reviews of this film were based upon Gibson's racist comments rather than a reflection on the movie. For all the faults of its director Apocalypto is a fairly good straight foreward adventure story.<br /><br />The year is roughly 1502 and the Pre Columbian Mayan tribe of Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) seems to be doing pretty well in their jungle village away from the great Mayan cities. Jaguar Paw has a pregnant wife Seven (Dalia Hernandez) and a young son. One morning his village is attacked by the Holcane warriors led by Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo).<br /><br />The Holcane are destroying villages and taking prisoners to be used as slaves and sacrifices in a great Mayan city. The second act of the film details the death march to the city. Gibson's premise is that the great civilization was destroyed due to rot from the inside and this point is adequately made in the ultra violent sacrifice scenes in this section of the film.<br /><br />The third part of the film deals with Jaguar Paw's escape from the Holcane and his return to rescue his wife and young son. The third part of the film is pure action adventure. More like a cross between Rambo and Run Lola Run. This is pure adrenalin driven action and if you view it as such you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />See this film for the action and not for great social commentary and it's a pretty fair if often brutal adventure. I found myself liking the film far more than I thought I would.<br /><br />The disc includes a making of featurette, Becoming Mayan and a enjoyable commentary by Gibson and cowriter/producer Farhad Safinia.<br /><br />Rent it rather than buy unless ultra violence is your thing.</p></body></html>

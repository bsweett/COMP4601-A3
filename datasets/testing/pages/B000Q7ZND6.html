Well, I watched this one at an advanced screening a while back but unfortunately missed the first 15 minutes. So, I missed the exorcism scene which is a shame. Well, you know what this means, I'm going to have to get this one once it's out on DVD. But that's not all, it's actually a good movie. It was confusing at times but I think that this movie is deeper than most say. The movie is about John Constantine, a man that can see dead people that walk on earth. He thus has to take them back to hell where they belong. The beautiful Rachel Weisz co stars also as someone who believes that the "suicide" of her sister isn't a suicide. The way that Constantine travels to Hell is really neat and original and the fight scenes are really neat, as he has some really cool weapons. The bible is also referenced in the movie but this isn't the same bible. This one has a "deleted" section where it speaks about the son of the devil. The movie is very original and neat and if you ignore some very confusing moments, you'll like it. But, no one else did, so I guess I'm a SPECIAL CHILD! I'm the same guy though that dissliked Scarface and Taxi Driver, so you kmow..<br /><br />I also found something very neat about this movie. At the death of the devil's son, I noticed that he posed no resistance and just died. So, I saw in a weird way a parallel between Jesus and him as they both went down without resistance to accomplish a mission. Anyway, if you are religious, you might notice this like I did, and there are some other religious moments. That's what I think about a movie that very few people like.</p></br><a href="../users/AOXL514GEE4AA.html">AOXL514GEE4AA</a><br/><p>Based on the HELLBLAZER comics, John Constantine (played like a robot by Keanu Reeves) is a demon hunter that can see demons and angels. His responsibility is to keep them in line if they go beyond what is allowed in tipping the balance between good and evil. The film revolves around detective Angela Dodson (the gorgeous Rachel Weisz) and her twin that commits suicide. She seeks the help of Constantine to determine what external forces may have played a role in her death. As they unravel the mystery they learn that her sister's death was only to draw Angela to play a part in a diabolical scheme. The concept and story are great. The supporting roles are filled by great actors like Shia LeBeouf, Tilda Swinton and check out who plays Lucifer! Keanu just kills it. He was great in the Matrix when asked to play like a robot because that's about all he is good at, lately. In Constantine, it just doesn't work. Viggo Mortensen or Guy Pearce would have made this a 4 star movie, but although the story and effects are good...Keanu brings it down a notch.<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: Excellent picture and sound. All special features from DVD are here. FINAL VERDICT: UPGRADE WORTHY!</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>This is one of those movies that people either loved or they hated. Well I'm one of them that loved it. The storyline could have been a bit blasphemous for certain christians, but the acting and computer graphics fits perfectly with the time. The supporting cast also helped keep the story interesting. You can expect a bit of "the exorcist" in the film. I enjoyed this movie and think outside the box.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>I generally hate comic book films because they suck miserably. Aside from this, The Dark Knight, Iron Man, and Hellboy, I pretty much hate everything else. I was disappointed that this film got mixed reviews from critics and moviegoers, but I enjoyed it for what it was and I believe it to be underappreciated.<br />WHAT IT'S ABOUT: The story is about John Constantine; a chain-smoking, pissed off exorcist who has been barred from the gates of Heaven, but must do God's work by deporting half-breed demons (Part human, part demon) who break the rules back to Hell, who gets caught up with a detective named Angela, who believes her sister Isabel didn't commit suicide and wants John to investigate as to why she killed herself. While this is going on, John finds out that full-fledged demons are entering the Earth when they are not permitted to and breaking the rules and now they're after him and Angela. While this is going on, a man armed with the Spear of Destiny (A spear that it Catholic beliefs killed Jesus when it pierced his side and not the crucifixion) is traveling to Los Angeles where most of the story takes place because he is possessed and as he goes along, kills animals and makes people become demon-possessed. Now John and Angela must find out what is going on both sides and why this is happening. Unfortunately, the story gets confusing and becomes difficult to follow; the lowest point of the film.<br />MUSIC: The musical score in this film is quite good and knows how to set the mood.<br />ACTING: Although some people complain about Keanu Reeves's (The Matrix trilogy, Speed) acting, I didn't think he was bad in this film or any other film he's been in. Rachel Weisz (The Mummy, The Mummy Returns, Enemy at the Gates) has generally always been a good actress and there's no exception here. The rest of the actors were pretty good as well; except Shia LaBeouf, his character; Chazz; was just annoying as hell. The actors overall did a good job, even if the story and some parts of their dialogue were somewhat muddled.<br />ACTION: This is where the film shines. The action scenes were generally pretty good, coupled with some of the best CGI effects you'll ever see in a film and this film gives one of the most interesting perspectives on what Hell looks like and it's quite creepy and frightening. This film has a number of clever weapon designs like the shotgun that fires ammo from golden shells made from melted crucifixes. The action scenes could be explosive and even has touches of gore. Nicely done.<br />OVERALL: This film might offend anyone who is overly religious and they will probably claim this film to be Satanic. Those who aren't so overly touchy about religion should not be offended. If you like action flicks with an interesting twist, Constantine is definitely worth a look even if the storyline stumbles. This is indeed one of the better comic book-based films around.<br />THE GOOD: Amazing CGI, cool actions, good acting, good music, and an interesting storyline.<br />THE BAD: Storyline is confusing, the film can run into some moments of boredom, and Shia LaBeouf.</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>good against evil. the two come together in this movie, through the oldest form in the book. excorsisms and demons. keanu was a great constantine. you know there's just some people who were made for their roles, and this man is it. great actor, really gives it his all. from speed, the devils advocate, the lake house, and now this. flawless performance, no complaints all compliments. and his costar rachel weisz worked excellent as well. she was great in the mummy part one and two, she had me applauding her in the jury, and now here, i was impressed. nicely done, great actress. constantine is one of my favorites, it's a pleaser. the man fights demons, he has a ticket strait to hell, but he's not going without taking with him a few freaks. he meets this psychic and they battle the forces of evil side by side. and in the end, as always good triumphs over evil. constantine's debt is repaid, and he must go on doing what he does best. splendid movie certainly deserves some great props.</p></br><a href="../users/A1U360OMVQRPUB.html">A1U360OMVQRPUB</a><br/><p>This is a review of the HD DVD only, not a review of the movie or the actors.<br /><br />With the advent of the new HD DVD players, movie studios are releasing movies in that format.  Some aren't even really changed at all, and those who purchase them are only getting a repackaged product that will allow them to place it on the shelves with the other HD DVDs.<br /><br />CONSTANTINE is one of the movies that will really make an HD DVD system and surround sound system shine.  The movie is jam-packed with special effects that look great on an HD monitor.  Pausing the movie allows the viewer to look at a crystal-clear image that has to be seen to be believed.  The audio portion of the film will slam through the surround sound system.<br /><br />Anyone who loved the movie but hasn't bought the 2-disc special edition of CONSTANTINE can pick this one up.  The HD DVD comes fully loaded with all the extras.  The smooth, new interface available on the HD DVD formatting that allows a viewer to effortlessly switch back and forth between the movie and the special features is well worth the upgrade.</p></br><a href="../users/A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q.html">A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q</a><br/><p>Sometimes it mystifies me why a group of people will all go out and get ID's so that they can write exactly one negative review of a film.  Constantine seems to have managed to outrage both the Hellblazer comic book crowd and the and the 'this is blasphemous' club.  After all, Constantine is intended as light entertainment, not scripture or imitation.  So let's just take a look at the film in and of itself for a moment. After all, if a film arouses this much antipathy there must be something to it.<br /><br />In John Constantine's (Keanu Reeves) world evil and good are locked in the age old struggle, but there are rules that the two sides play by.  The big rule is that true demons and angels cannot cross over to this plane, although there are plenty of what Constantine refers to as 'half-breeds' to make up the difference.  Constantine is something of an enforcer.  If demons get to out of line, his job is to whomp on them and send them back to hell.  How did he get the job?  It seems that when psychics commit suicide they run the risk of being both damned and restored to a job with no opportunities for advancement.  To make matters worse, John is dying for the second time - from lung cancer.<br /><br />Something is wronger than usual - trash scavengers have uncovered the spear of Longinus, there is unrest among the minions, and a woman commits suicide who never should have.  The woman's sister, Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) is a detective determined to understand how the tragedy could happen.  Before long Dodson and Constantine are working together and they find themselves faced with not just a few souls out of place, but a rebellion in hell that threatens to drop all humanity into the end of days.<br /><br />Reeves creates a Constantine who is more taciturn than the Hellblazer character, but whose grit and brusqueness still make him an interesting figure.  Weisz has more script and she fulfills her part as a foil for Constanine beautifully, This is a film which is decidedly un-sexy, regardless of the attractiveness of the leads.  The bit characters - half-angel Gabriel (played by Tilda Swinton who captures the angel's ambiguous sexuality perfectly), half-demon Balthazar (Gavin Rossdale), Midnote (Djimon Hounsou), and Beeman (Max Baker) - all have a crisp, comic book reality.  And Peter Stormare does an outstanding job as Satan twisted in a whole new fashion.<br /><br />Director Francis Lawrence does a notable job of capturing the feel of comic book illustration and framing within the parameters of film.  The film is carefully balanced between comic book sarcasm, humor, and the horrible seriousness of the underlying theme.  Putting everyone's 'issues' aside (and everyone seems to have one issue or another about Constantine) this is lightweight but well constructed piece of filmic fiction.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>If you liked Keanu Reeves in The Devil's Advocate (1997), you'll like him in this devilish story.<br /><br />  A Hispanic, Manuel (Jesse Ramirez) is under the ruins of a freeway.  Under some wooden planks in the ground he finds an accient dagger wrapped in a Nazi flag.  With he dagger, he begins to walk away and suddenly is hit by a car that came out of nowhere.  He appears to be dead, but 27 seconds later, still holding the dagger he becomes alive and runs off.  The car is totalled, but Manuel is perfect.<br /><br />  An Asian mother (Suzanne Wang) find her daughter (Jhoanna Trias) possessed.  John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is called upon to help the girl. He is a modern-day exorcist.  First he finds the right religious symbol to shadow upon the girl for irritation.  Then he gets himself close to the demon's face and calls it a profanity. When the demon's face tries to come out of the girl's throat, Constantine gives it a right hook.<br /><br />  John Constantine is really tired of fighting the demons all the time and he just found out he has lung cancer from smoking since he was 15.  Be as it may other people are still in need of his help, including Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) who had a twin sister that fell from the hospital roof, but she believes it was murder.<br /><br />  Stay tuned after the end credits.  There is one more scene.<br /><br />  DVD includes in Special Features many deleted scenes and audio commentary.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JP0URFHXP6DO.html">A2JP0URFHXP6DO</a><br/><p>Now I hate to be one of those people that whines about how the movie was not as good as the book, or in this case, the comic book, but I'm going to have to.  It's especially frustrating as we just saw Frank Miller's Sin City come out not long after and stay very faithful, even down to the gritty two-color look.  I don't have a problem with Keanu Reeves but he simply was not the right guy to play a chain-smoking, run-down, sardonic Englishman that Constantine is supposed to be.  I think someone like Gary Oldman would have been a great choice to play Constantine.<br /><br />Keanu does the chain smoking but he looks like a guy who just started smoking yesterday, rather than the wizened, look of someone who actually HAD been chain smoking for years...add to that he does about the WORST fake coughing I've ever heard in my life.  The average ten year-old kid can fake a cough better to get out of school than Keanu does in this film.<br /><br />I don't mind the CGI and I think the director Francis lawrence did a pretty good job of NOT getting carried away with too many visual effects.  But how does a guy who never directed a feature film before get the reins to a film with this large a budget anyway?  While he resisted going overboard with the CGI he couldn't resist in turning what was a pure, very dark horror comic into a Van Helsing meets the Devil action flick.  There's more action in the average episode of "This Old House" than there is in an issue of Hellblazer.  Hellblazer is NOT an action hero...he's not a hero period.  Not even a good guy really and ultimately that's what Lawrence had him become...a pretty boy demon hunter.<br /><br />I won't delve too much into the script although I'd love to know why the Spear of Destiny was buried in the Mexican desert.  The film does have a pretty good supporting cast with Rachel Weisz as the cop/psychic object of the devil's search, and Peter Stromare as the devil himself in yet another oddball role he seems born to play.<br /><br />With all that said I'm still going to give it a slightly positive review.  I thought the story was pretty well-written although I think the plot was perhaps a bit too grand.  The affects were good, particularly those scenes in the wind-blasted desolation of hell.  Overall its hit or miss but there's more good than bad.</p></br><a href="../users/AWPODHOB4GFWL.html">AWPODHOB4GFWL</a><br/><p>Taken from the `Hellblazer' comic book series, "Constantine" is a horrific, sickening, fun, campy, gore fest.  Keanu Reeves plays his regular wooden self helping Rachel Weisz try to save the hell-bound fate of her twin sister who committed suicide.  He has special powers to rid demons from earth and spends most of his time walking through the movie coughing up the results of years of smoking.  The story is simply Reeves trying to balance good and evil between God and Satan on earth.  He seeks out those old good-evil, angel-devil half breeds.  Some of his encounters are digitally amazing.  The story is mildly entertaining, but the effects are truly inspiring, if not nauseatingly inventive.  Reeves makes frequent trips to hell and the scenery is spectacular.  Tilda Swinton also makes a cameo as angel Gabriel who tells Reeves that basically, he is f***ed!  It's half funny and half scary. It is not a pleasant movie, but is nothing short of pure entertainment.  Not for young kids by any measure!</p></br><a href="../users/AZSN1TO0JI87B.html">AZSN1TO0JI87B</a><br/><p>Based on the comic book, "Hellblazer," "Constantine" tells the story of John Constantine (Keanu Reeves), a demon-hunter with special abilities who travels the country performing exorcisms and trying to get on God's good graces before he faces eternal damnation. It is established early on that he has a terminal illness, so the movie turns into a race against time. When Constantine teams up with a policewoman by the name of Angela (Rachel Weisz) whose identical twin sister may or may have not committed suicide, he sees one more chance for redemption. Following up his successful stint in the "Matrix" trilogy, Keanu handles the character effortlessly. I'm not too familiar with the comics, but in my head, he nailed the part. I couldn't imagine anyone else in the role (rumors say Nicholas Cage was originally set to play it...ugh). Rachel Weisz and her character compliment the character of "Constantine" and gives us something to be sympathetic too (she also looks great in a wet shirt). Alongside the two, the movie also co-stars Mr. Gwen Stefani himself, Gavin Rossdale (who is actually really good in this movie), Shia "Even Stevens" Lebeouf and Peter Stormare, who seems to have a little too much fun in the role of Satan. "Constantine" is full to the brim with disturbing images and arresting action sequences, as promised by the previews. No doubt, it's a pretty intense and involving movie. First time feature film director Francis Lawrence (whom, prior to this only handled music videos) shows us what he's made of and handles the movie effortlessly, with the skill of a director with much more experience. My main complaint with the movie though, is that the pace seems to be a bit chunky. Everytime a big action scene comes along, and you start to get focused on the material, it stops and we all unwind for about 20 minutes. The movie just doesn't seem to take off. It's good, no doubt, but it has that terminal flaw. It's hard to get into all the action when we keep getting relieved. It's still an exciting movie, and probably the best you're gonna see this time of year. It's got a bit of horror, a bit of black comedy, and a lot of action. Surely you could do worse.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Fighting Hell on Earth, John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) faces demons every day trying to keep the balance between Heaven and Hell in the City of Angels, Los Angeles. Constantine is damned for something mysterious in his past and he's trying to work it off hoping to buy his way into Heaven. God, though, isn't buying. When Constatine realizes that demons are not possessing humans but are trying to cross over he reluctantly teams with police detective Rachel Weisz in trying to discover who was behind the death of her sister. The two meet when Weisz seeks an audience with a priest who happens to be meeting with the Earthly form of the angel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton).<br /><br />Aimed at audiences with a combination of elements from "The Exorcist" and action adventure movies inspired by comic books, "Constantine" may not be true to its source (the comic book "Hellblazer") but the powerful visual effects combined with strong performances makes this film worthwhile. While I had my doubts about Reeves pulling off the role of Constantine, he proved to be outstanding in the role. Unlike, say, Neo from "The Matrix", Constantine comes across as a selfish, rude loner interested in using his gift to see the demons that walk around uninvited in our world but not totally accepting responsibility for the consquences of his action. Weisz pulls off her role as Detective Angela Dodson with just the right mix of street smarts and disbelief at what she sees when in the company of Constantine. Gavin Rossdale comes across as a bit of a cypher as Balthazar an Earthbound half breed demon working who is Constantine's opposite in this battle for humanity.<br /><br />While first time film director Francis Lawrence puts together fascinating images, he occasionally loses control of the narrative causing audiences to play catch up with the story. That's OK, thouh, as it keeps the audience from guessing every twist and turn of this unusual film. The screenplay by Kevin Brodbin(the fascinating but unseen thriller "Mindhunters") and Frank Cappello (cult classic "No Way Back") borrows enough from the source material to keep this original tale interesting for fans of the comic book source and those unfamiliar with it. Many fans of the comic will, no doubt, be upset with the liberties taken with the material but I'd sugget keeping an open mind and viewing this as you would any film taken from another source.<br /><br />The visually stunning sequences set in Hell along with those portraying Heaven with impressive CGI effects make this a memorable film. Although it isn't perfect, the film provides a solid two hours of entertainment with a number of fascinating ideas and questions raised about this world and the next. Exceptionally good supernatural thriller although it may be too visually dense to attract the audience it needs to succeed.</p></br><a href="../users/A120GIT50UISJP.html">A120GIT50UISJP</a><br/><p>Family member possessed by demons? Call John Constantine [Keanu Reeves], a spiritual warrior for hire. In Constantine's world, shady dealers sell dragon's breath and holy water to people like Constantine, who can see demons in their true form, and battle them back to hell. But, chain-smoking, coughing up blood, it's not demons that are going to get him, it's lung cancer.<br /><br />Constantine isn't selfless, especially with death so close. He wants to win his way into the good graces of god, but no matter how many souls he saves, it's not enough. Or so his mentor, a half-breed angel-human, Gabriel [Tilda Swinton], tells him. Not until he stops squandering his gift (Constantine would call it a curse), and does good for the sake of doing good. But Constantine calls it unfair, and refuses to play. Gabriel has no answers for him--tormented by the demons, Constantine attempted suicide as a youth, and was dead for two minutes. For that sin, he is damned.<br /><br />The strange world Constantine lives in has become even stranger. Full demons are attacking him and others, something they are not supposed to be able to do. Half-breeds, part human, part demon or angel, can exist on our plane, but full demons and angels stay home, in hell or heaven. Constantine must find the reason for this breach of the rules before the worst of the worst cross over into our plane and consign all humanity to hell.<br /><br />Fascinating in the rich world that it creates, Constantine will keep you asking questions about good and evil, heaven and hell, and the power of humanity to choose.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NL1KW56O3JR8.html">A3NL1KW56O3JR8</a><br/><p>I like occult movies generally and I like Keanu Reeves as an actor: both of which are things that my put me in the minority.

A lot of possibilities, but just not enough hits the mark to make this one I can recommend.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EBLL2OYEQJN9.html">A2EBLL2OYEQJN9</a><br/><p>Constantine is your basic man-vs-devil plot, with lots of biblical and mythological history thrown in.

Everyone in the movie, in fact, showed no emotion.  No one ever got excited or agitated--they maintained the same calm, steady pace no matter whether they were doing something mundane or trying to save the future of mankind.<br /><br />This plot had a lot of potential, but it seems like the focus was on neat-o special effects and not on decent acting.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSMQIF1C2VCE.html">A1NSMQIF1C2VCE</a><br/><p>Let me say this up-front: I'm a huge fan of the "Hellblazer" comic book, especially the long run by Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon. So I was more than a little nervous about this movie. But at the same time, I also like films like this, even when they're not connected to any existing franchise.<br /><br />"Constantine" feels like it both took too little from the comic books and not enough, which is a neat trick. There's likely a heck of a good movie on the cutting room floor or, more likely, in previous versions of the scripts that were sliced and spliced together to make the theatrical version of the film.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves plays LA detective John Constantine or, as he says it, "John Constantine, a-hole." That's a cute line, but it points to one of the major problems with the film: It's Schwarzeneggerized. Dialogue in the movie, for the most part, consists of clever catch phrases (and we know "John Constantine, a-hole" is a catch phrase because a riff is done on it by another character within the first minute of Reeves saying it in the movie). Is he an a-hole? Hard to tell: In the comics, he certainly is -- John Constantine in "Hellblazer" will sacrifice small children to save a city, or sell someone else's soul for a marginally improved chance of defeating an enemy. In the film, Reeves' Constantine is mostly just moody, but we never heard him say "I'm Neo, a-hole" or "I'm either Bill or Ted, a-hole" in previous movies, despite his Constantine not being dramatically different from any of his other roles. But it's a cute line, so we're stuck with it.<br /><br />In the comics, these clever bits that Constantine says are spaced out over several issues and we see a lot more of his street level grungy street magic. He's not a cool guy, he's a failed human being who happens to pull a rabbit out of his hat and save the day, once in a while, but at great cost to everyone around him. In the movie, we get all the cool bits and none of the context. This is Neo in wool instead of leather and using magic instead of virtual reality.<br /><br />Likewise, the story, involving the Devil's son, angels and demons involved in a cold war on Earth and twin psychics, is very authentically "Hellblazer" -- specifically, it hits a lot of the moments in the Ennis/Dillon run -- but where it should explain, it skims and where it should move quickly, it broods on arty sequences. As a result, the actual plot of the movie comes suddenly at the end, and it feels as though most of what came before was unneeded, and it probably was.<br /><br />Having said that, the film looks like a million bucks, whether it's cinematography, special effects or costuming. You can certainly see where they spent the money they saved on having a solid script doctor come in and clean things up afterwards.<br /><br />Those interested in the subject matter -- a war between Heaven and Hell in a modern urban landscape -- would be better advised to pick up the Ennis/Dillon "Hellblazer" paperbacks (all of which are available here at Amazon) instead. "Hellblazer" fans would be advised to rent this, at most.<br /><br />Someone, someday, will make a great gritty supernatural thriller set on the mean streets of London. "Constantine" isn't it, and isn't even a particularly satisfying appetizer for that film.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Based on the long running Hellblazer comic series from DC/Vertigo, Constantine is an underrated big budget smash.  Keanu Reeves, of all people, is cast as John Constantine: a man caught between Heaven and Hell.  Coming to the assistance of a detective (Rachel Weisz) whose twin sister committed suicide, Constantine faces off against half-breed demons and angels, embroiled in a plot to bring Hell to Earth.  Pseudo-catholic mythology aside, the film for the most part has an intriguing story, and the CGI effects are top notch.  Reeves is fine as an american accented John Constantine, while Weisz gives the best performance of the film.  Tilda Swinton is a nice touch as the asexual Gabriel, Bush singer Gavin Rossdale provides a few chuckles as a slimy demon, and Peter Stormare makes a great Lucifer.  As a whole, Constantine is a great mainstream thriller, even though it is a bit drawn out, and at times, a bit hokey.  With all the negative reviews that Constantine has garnered since it's initial release (from reviewers and comic fans alike), it's terribly underrated for what it really is.  Yes, John's not english or blonde (Sean Bean, who has been in everything from the first Lord of the Rings film to Troy, would have been an excellent choice had the film been more faithful to it's source material), but it's still better than many of the recent comic to film adaptations to be released as of late.  The 2-disc Deluxe Edition DVD features some nice extras, including a horde of deleted scenes, and featurettes on the origin of the character.</p></br><a href="../users/ACEA95FQS1AVP.html">ACEA95FQS1AVP</a><br/><p>If you liked the Prophecy films with Christopher Walken--you'll probably enjoy Constantine.

The story begins with the finding of the "Sword of Destiny" - the sword that was used to spear Jesus Christ on the Cross at Calvary - and ends with John Constantine battled none other than Lucifer himself.<br /><br />Constantine moves along at a good pace and provides an immersive story that will keep you engrossed. There are grand battles with flying demons, and a good working chemistry between Keanu Reeves and Rachal Weisz. Overall, you will walk away from Constantine having been entertained as well as glad you stepped into the fictional world of the "Hellblazer."<br /><br />There are some weak spots to the film. Keanu Reeves was generally very convining, but had moments (especially when he was smoking cigarettes) where he seemed a little off. There were also some blatant inconsistancies that can leave the audience scratching their collective heads. For example: in the first 45 minutes of Constantine, John Constantine is continuously smoking cigarettes, and we are shown (quite often) the severity of his lung cancer. Then, for seemingly no reason, this character issue is forgotten. There is no hint of cigarettes or lung cancer until one of the last scenes.<br /><br />Despite these odd defects, Constantine is worth viewing.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 71<br /><br />38 (out of 50).

Even though there are movies out there with the similar ideas and plots as this, none of them are really like it. Constantine tells of this exorcist or whatever, trying to buy his way into heaven, later meeting up with this cop searching for answers to what really happened to her identical twin sister Isabel. As the movie goes on, she realizes that the stuff that she and her sister saw when they were little girls were indeed real, both holding psychic powers, which brings in her key part in the movie.<br /><br />Good acting by good actors and pretty nice movie to watch, quite a bit of action but doesn't go overboard but again a good thing because nowadays, younger viewers are all crazy for a lot of explosives etc, which I find now to be a bunch of bs and nothing that makes you think much, guess thats why the average IQ is so low now.<br /><br />Again, everyone should watch this instead of listening to a bunch of reviews of people on the net. I've watched good movies that people say suck and I've watched bad movies that people say are good. Only way to really find out...is to watch it on your own.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>Constantine, the film, is based on the Vertigo comic of the same name. The main character in the comic and the film is John Constantine, a chain smoking British mystic who gets involved with angels, demons and thing that go bump in the night and the day.<br /><br />Fans of the comic (like me) will like the special effects filled story centering around the war between Heaven and Hell and the discovery of an artifact called the "Spear of Destiny". I was glad to see a truly "R" rated film, after seeing so many tame PG-13 horror flicks. The main issue with Constantine: "Can Keanu play a convincing Constantine?" My answer: Yes he can, but not the Constantine from the comic.<br /><br />Other critics called the plot "confusing"; I don't get this one. The plot is very simple, I guess these critics would go into convulsions if they read a Constantine comic!<br /><br />Bottom line: the extremely negative reviews are bogus, trust critics who review horror films on a regular basis.</p></br><a href="../users/A3E5OY3YLZMOA9.html">A3E5OY3YLZMOA9</a><br/><p>A lot of people are saying that Constantine is wrong because Keanu Reeves is wrong for the part but I see it differently. See I'm no fan of Reeves and I actually think of him as a dry and predictable actor that always acts the same in every film. The stories he gets and his supporting cast is so good that they make him look even better and he gets a high price tag. Constantine needed an actor to play the character as a mean, intimidating, and vicious loner and who better to play that than a man who had that exact role in his previous films.<br /><br /> So I don't see Reeves as a problem but why this film gets such low ratings could either be that it's not true to the comic like other reviewers suspected or it could be because it's not true to the history of the real Constantine. Whatever it may be with those who have the knowledge of the comic or factual history this is a good movie either way. The acting is nothing to be excited about but trust me that the movies perspective on good and evil are interesting enough to keep you entertained over and over again. It's got some scares in it if you scare easily and it may even have your mind twisted around it's concepts longer than you think.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ8DU6XVA3USJ.html">AQ8DU6XVA3USJ</a><br/><p>Dreadfully flawed and with a muddled story line, "Constantine" is nevertheless worth watching, for its occasional profound and intense beauty, and its visions of hell and its denizens, which anyone who believes that forces of evil exist and influence our world will find fascinating. Loosely based on characters from the Hellblazer comics, the script is very interesting in parts, but the audio is abysmal. The dialog sounds as if it is coming from an underwater tunnel, and I had to watch the film with subtitles. Also, this is a film that begs to be seen several times, to make some sense of the muddle.<br /><br />The cast is excellent, and I have always been partial to Keanu Reeves, who as John Constantine, a man dying of lung cancer, who can see, and has walked beyond this dimension, is very good in his own peculiar way. I can't imagine anyone else of his generation playing the part. As he says of the cat in the film, he's "half in, half out," and Reeves also has that quality, of being in the world, but not quite of it. Rachel Weisz, who teamed with Reeves in the far less interesting 1996 "Chain Reaction," is both Angela, a Los Angeles detective, and her twin sister Isabel. She looks gorgeous, and gives a sensitive, lovely performance. Others in the cast that stand out are Tilda Swinton as Gabriel, and Shia LaBeouf, as Chas, Constantine's eager apprentice.<br /><br />This is the feature directorial debut of Francis Lawrence, who has previously done music videos, and he certainly has an eye for bizarre imagery. The cinematography by Philippe Rousselot is terrific, and much of what is worthwhile in this film is due to him. It is hard to rate this film, as it is, like the battle of good and evil in the story, a mixture of opposites. Total running time is 121 minutes, it is rated R for "violence and demonic images," but is comparatively mild in language and has no in-between the sheets action. The DVD extra is 18 minutes of deleted scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>I missed "Constantine" in theaters and thus looked forward to discovering for the first time via home viewing a quality motion picture adaptation of a popular comic book character.  And, in the end, I did enjoy the film.  Just be warned that it isn't like the "Spider-Man" movies.  Unlike those earlier films, "Constantine" is more interesting and intellectually stimulating than exciting.<br /><br />In particular, I enjoyed the film's somewhat subversive vision that the goals and objectives emanating from Heaven and Hell are sometimes laced with the same base political motivations that are often the springboards for the official positions held by powerful organizations here on Earth.  I liked how the bad guys could be charming and somewhat sympathetic despite their Hellish origins, and how the holy characters (I'm mostly thinking of Tilda Swinton's Angel Gabriel character here) can come up with questionable and truly bizarre plans to rid the Earth of evil, even if it means something close to apocalypse has to result in the meantime.<br /><br />The film skillfully mixes several genres and flavors (horror movie, detective thriller, and romance story among them), which successfully results in an entertaining whole.  It's just not a wildly entertaining whole, and you'll probably have more fun disecting the movie with a friend afterward over a beer than you did when you were watching it.<br /><br />I bought the two-disc special edition, and the extras on the second disc are very well done.  In fact, if you don't know much about the Constantine character beforehand it's perfectly safe to watch the first couple of featurettes on the second disc before you watch the movie; they discuss the comic book origins of the character and the goals the film makers had in adapting the character to the screen.  These featurettes don't give away any major plot points and may make it easier to appreciate the film a little more when you watch it.  As a John Constantine novice I wished that I had watched those extra features first; I would have gotten more out of my first viewing of the movie.<br /><br />Still, I enjoyed "Constantine".  After all, one has to have a soft spot for a movie that suggests that even death isn't an escape from the mundane bureaucracies of daily life, that one just trades dull rules and regulations administered by earthbound bureaucrats with mundane rules and regulations administered by angels and demons.  That whole riff was pretty funny, actually.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>I have no familiarity whatsoever with the graphic novel upon which this film is based, so I can only address the film in and of itself.  And I must say that I rather enjoyed it for the most part.  Anything with angels and demons always interests me, and this film put a quirky spin on the agents of God and Lucifer.  Since John Constantine seems to be a pretty tight-lipped fellow who doesn't reveal much of himself to anyone, Keanu Reeves seems like a pretty good pick to play the part - there's not too much acting required for this one.<br /><br />So what's this all about?  Well, John Constantine has this gift (or curse) to see and interact with creatures from both heaven and hell; he's already been to hell and back once - literally - and therein lies his biggest problem.  Since he did commit suicide, he's not eligible for a ticket to heaven later on - and this second life he was given is hurtling toward an impending end thanks to all those cigarettes he's chain-smoked for years.  He's content to go his own moping way, dealing with particularly difficult exorcisms when called upon and generally just bemoaning his awful fate.  Then a female cop (Rachel Weisz) shows up asking for his help; her sister supposedly committed suicide, but she doesn't believe it.  Both Rachel and her sister were pretty special, for they could also see the things Constantine sees (although it takes some rather intense training for Constantine to reawaken those abilities in his new, temporary partner).  It soon seems obvious that something big is going down.  More and more demons are trying to cross into our world, violating a big treaty between God and Lucifer (who would have thought that demons couldn't be trusted?), and that just doesn't bode well for anybody.  Before you know it, special effects are coming at you left and right, and the birth of the Antichrist is almost at hand.<br /><br />Now, you're probably thinking that old Mr. Pitchfork himself is behind the whole Antichrist thing - but that ain't necessarily so.  The movie manages to throw in a couple of small surprises toward the end (although it certainly breaks no new ground in showing Lucifer as a really stupid being).  I really hated the characterization of the angel Gabriel, though.  First off, I just don't see Gabriel as a woman, but more importantly, this Gabriel comes across as a far from superior being.  This isn't the first time we've seen a Gabriel who hated and conspired against humans (out of jealousy), but Constantine's Gabriel is a far cry from a similar archangel in, for example, The Prophecy.<br /><br />The plot of this movie isn't all that bad, but it could have been told much more effectively.  If you're not into this kind of weird subject matter, you may look upon the story as little more than an excuse to throw some impressive special effects together.  I'm giving Constantine a somewhat tentative four stars, but I'm sure there are a good many people who won't enjoy the film very much at all.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>An Ok actioner based on the comic book called Hellblazer about John Constantine, played by Keanu Reeves (The Matrix Triology, Point Break) who's smoking himself to death...hell wants him and heaven wont take him but earth needs him is basically the theme for the movie and he embarks on a case of twins, both played by Rachel Weisz (Runaway Jury, Confidence) and one of them mysteriously dies but the other twin doesnt believe that she would kill herself. So, Constantine shows her what he sees...soon, Constantine learns that the Devil's son wants to get loose onto the world and in order for him to do that he needs God's blood and the vessel is the remaining twin Weisz. Not bad for what it is.....better then some of the movies that came out so far...better then Alone In The Dark. Reeves is alright though he has his moments though we can hardly hear him he talks so soft he pays up in the action sequences...its what he's good at. Weisz is pretty damn hot. Also starring Djimon Honsou (Gladiator, Deep Rising) as Poppa Midnight....good name for him...the voodoo man. Peter Stormare (Armageddon, Fargo) comes at the end playing Lucifier, decked out in all white (hey, it fits him well) Pruitt Taylor Vince (Identity, Mississippi Burning), Shea LeBouf (Holes, The Battle At Shaker Heights) is all grown up and is out of his teeny bopper faze and a surprising acting debut by Bush lead singer Gavin Rossdale who takes on the role as Balthazar. Isn't the best...I do not worship this movie to death but I liked it enough to recommend it to fans of the comic book or fans of any of the stars. Good yet not a masterpiece.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ADG449ZNEO6Y.html">A1ADG449ZNEO6Y</a><br/><p>It's the best movie I've seen all year "so far" at the movie theater.I actually enjoyed it more than Robert DeNiro's "Hide and Seek".<br /><br />Constantine ~ is a good movie.No there's not alot of action but alot of explaining about what's going on with Heaven & Hell.<br /><br />If anyone ever seen The Prophecy with Christoper Walken then you should know alittle bit more about Constantine and you would know "Gabriel" the angel is a renegade only doing things for his or herself.<br /><br />With all the movies relating to Satin , Heaven , Hell and Demons.I'd have to say Constantine is better than all.It wasn't scary or anything ,just a great story for a movie.You can't stick this movie next to The Exorcist , Halloween or Friday the 13th.<br /><br />Constantine falls , between Van Helsing but in 2005 and maybe alittle bit of End of Days since the influence of evil spreads throughout humans "mentally".<br /><br />Go and see this movie , there's nothing else out there to see yet.Next on my list is Boogeyman.Can't wait for Batman Begins in the summer.Also Fantastic Four comes out too this year.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G69BQLIUMWPN.html">A1G69BQLIUMWPN</a><br/><p>I personally have not ever read the comics and didn't even know it was based on a comic-we went mostly because the special effects looked awesome.  I didn't think it was a terrible movie; a quite long movie I will say it was.  Almost 2 hours is quite long.  I personally thought Keanu was okay as an actor in it.  I didn't like the Gabriel role or the person who played Satan.  I LOVED that fact that once again Gavin Rossdale was in a movie-and he pulled off his part well to but seemed to be stretching also.  It just felt forced acting from ALL the actors and actresses.  But, the plot was good and the special effects rocked!  So I look over the acting.  I personally wonder if many people don't like the movie because it relies heavily on religion and you may start to debate your own faith?!  But, I found that part interesting and part of the suspense and sort of a horror factor came from the religion role.  It was a heck of a lot scarier than Bogeyman and Hide and Seek; for the fact that it was better at putting you in the movie and also catching you off guard more often.  Personally I think this movie is worth catching.  It isn't terrible but it feels super long-that is my biggest complaint.</p></br><a href="../users/A38UBVJEV1LLS7.html">A38UBVJEV1LLS7</a><br/><p>I saw this movie last year for my birthday, and I was so excited, because the trailer looked so promising. However, what I got was a mess of a movie and very, very, very mixed performances. I tried to justify this movie's shortfalls by focusing on its positives; however, the balance does not tip, it falls apart!!<br /><br />First of all, the visual effects in this movie are horrible. It has a posted budget of $100 million, and I can't help but wonder where all the money went and how many starving children could have been fed and clothed. Bad special effects, however, cannot compare to the wreck that is Keanu Reeves. He is a tragedy of epic proportions, evoking feeling of sickness and uncontrollable laughter all at once! It is IMPOSSIBLE to take him seriously. I can't think about it anymore.<br /><br />The positives are very positive, however. The storyline is interesting, intriguing, and attention holding; again, this only goes so far. Also, the supporting cast is superb. Djimon Hounsou and Tilda Swinton are excellent in their roles and almost make you forget about the aforementioned tragedy (Reeves, for those who are lost). However, it is Rachel Weisz that makes this film bearable. She is beautiful, mysterious, and involving. I have read so many reviews that say she was too good for this film, and they were right.<br /><br />Bottom line: you will beg for your 2 hours back, but Hounsou, Swinton, and Weiss (especially) soften the blow.</p></br><a href="../users/A3HM5G9IV1FTFP.html">A3HM5G9IV1FTFP</a><br/><p>I'll admit: I've never read the "Hellblazer" comic that "Constantine" is based on. But I was intrigued by the previews, and have enjoyed some other titles of DC Comics' VERTIGO line, so I decided to give this movie a shot.<br /><br />Surprise! I liked it. In fact, it's probably the best supernatural thriller I've seen in a while. (Did anyone else try to sit through "The Order" or "Lost Souls"? Blech!) What I think helped make the film work for me was the dark comedy subtly weaved throughout the film, which kept it from taking itself too seriously. In terms of the special affects and CGI, I thought they worked well; I never felt like they overpowered the film or the actors the way they did in a film like "Van Helsing", so I never felt like I was watching a cartoon instead of a live action film.<br /><br />As for the acting, I think it's time someone took a stand for much-criticized Mr. Reeves. True, he's not a technically superior actor, but he does have a definite charisma, and I think a very good sense of both action and comedy. (I've seen Keanu give good, effective performances in a variety of films, including "Something's Gotta Give", "The Gift", "Parenthood", "Speed", and, of course, the "Matrix" trilogy. So give poor Keanu a break guys! It's not his fault he's so pretty!) Especially when paired with a more cerebral actress like Rachel Weisz, Keanu does just fine.<br /><br />For a popcorn flick, I found this movie to be well-written, well-directed, exciting and fun. Don't be a playa hata!</p></br><a href="../users/A1SCD2NYTIAQTY.html">A1SCD2NYTIAQTY</a><br/><p>"Constantine" is a movie with one cool premise, and some serious potential. Sadly, I thought much of it was wasted and lost in the final product. While this does not make the movie bad, it certainly left me feeling that it could have offered more.<br /><br />Basically, the story follows Constantine, a coughing, hacking and wheezing demon hunter, (he smokes too much), who is caught up in the cosmic battle between God and Satan when the delicate balance of power is upset. The shadowy agreement, which included no direct influence on humans, gets shattered and Constantine gets caught up in the whole thing.<br /><br />The acting is pretty much the same as anything you would expect from Keannu Reeves, and most of the acting was of the same or similar quality. Peter Stormare's portrayal of Satan was particularly laughable.<br /><br />The somewhat corny ending really did not suit the overall darkness of the movie and seemed to try and salvage something of a feel-good, "good triumphs over evil" message. I will not mention that ending for those who have not seen it.<br /><br />"Constantine" was an average movie, but as I said, it could have been so much better. The special effects were excellent and the visual feast was awesome. Beyond that, it barely poked above average. Not something I would consider adding to the collection, but sure worth a few bucks in hiring it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2K3L0DOPQQ697.html">A2K3L0DOPQQ697</a><br/><p>I can't get why people review this particular item with 2- and 3-star reviews.  I mean, Keanu Reeves had already established himself as a great actor in The Matrix trilogy, while of course Rachel Weisz was the main reason that many people went to see the movie in the first place.  It was a great movie; I loved it.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves plays John Constantine, an ex-cop who believes that he is the only one who can stop an invasion of demons from taking over the world- and it helps that he can actually see the demons.  This movie contains a lot of supernatural material, the main reason why I saw this movie in the first place (besides Rachel Weisz, of course), seeing as I love supernatural thrillers.<br /><br />Constantine's main focus is on helping skeptical policewoman Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) to solve the mysterious suicide of her twin sister (also played by Weisz), and their investigation takes them through the world of demons and angels that exists just beneath the landscape of contemporary Los Angeles. Caught in a catastrophic series of otherworldy events, the two become inextricably involved and seek to find their own peace at whatever cost. Constantine takes many trips to hell and back by going through a body of standing water (i.e. his bathtub, a pan of water).  There are also many sequences of demonic activity and language that almost makes a sailor blush, but I still loved this movie.<br /><br />Once again, I complain that Amazon's review system only goes up to 5 stars; otherwise, this would be much higher-rated.  Definitely recommended for fans of sci-fi or horror movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>In the world of "Constantine," a lurid, bloodthirsty, stupid walk in that strange Catholic world of angels and demons, John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) has the gift of seeing said demons and angels on the earth as they apparently wage war for Earth. He's pretty tortured by it, and once, before he knew his seeing was a gift, he attempted suicide, was dead for two wags of a dog's tail, and, well, even though he lived, he's destined for hell for merely attempting a mortal sin. He's also graced with the knowledge that he's destined for hell.  The archangel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) tells him so. That's a helluva thing.<br /><br /> So cop Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) walks into John's life. Her twin sister was a mental patient who climbed to the top of a skyscraper and swan dove. That being a mortal sin - now she's in hell. Angela wants to go in hell herself, and has to immerse herself in a tub of cold water to do so. "Whatever you do,"  John says, "don't close your eyes." Eventually it's John, the cop, and Gabriel vs. Satan (Peter Stormare) and the lead singer from Bush in a holy rumble.<br /><br />Modern comic books and the movies about them are a lot more obsessed with anti-heroes - think "Spawn," "Sin City," "Blade," and "Hellboy" -  than they are heroes, and "Constantine" is firmly in that category: Good may prevail, but it does so in a way that credits evil. The world's dark, sinful and malevolent, but there's guns, cigarettes, women who look like Rachel Weisz and a couple other vices, so we got a chance.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>It's an effects-fest, it's an action flick, and it's a Keanu Reeves film. Despite that last point, it's an exciting bit of entertainment.<br /><br />Chain-smoking John Constantine sees demons everywhere, real demons. That sets him up with a great job as hired-gun exorcist, which gets him into and out of lots of interesting scrapes. He sees the angel Gabriel, and sees Hell as well. It's an up to date story in the heaven/hell/demons tradition. For me, it works well as an action story even though the pseudo-Catholic mythology doesn't.<br /><br />Reeves is Reeves, with his usual angst-laden running around and monotone voice. The pleasant surprise was Tilda Swinton as Gabriel. The role is vaguely androgynous, a good match for the gender-bending in Swinton's earlier "Orlando." She did a good job with her few appearances, and generally rose above the ordinary script she was given.<br /><br />If you like the demons-on-earth genre, you might find good entertainment here. Unless it's truly exceptional, though, an exorcism movie's premise just never grabs me. I came away from Constantine un-grabbed.<br /><br />//wiredweird<br /><br />PS: This is an adaptation from the Hellblazer comic book series, which I haven't read. Based on what I saw in this movie, I probably won't bother.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>Constantine is a totally preposterous movie, but there is something quite engaging about the film. The way the film combines a dynamic noir visual style with the more traditional horror motifs is both exciting and compelling, and for all its faults, Constantine is not a hesitant film, but it's not really a successful one either. Full of some dizzying special effects, and some fairly good acting, the film's director could probably be forgiven for constructing a story that doesn't make a lot of sense.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves, stars as the enigmatic visionary John Constantine. John has been having bad time of it of late. He's been a chain smoker since fifteen and he's just found out that he has terminal lung cancer. He's not letting this stop him from doing his job tough. Recently he's discovered that "half-breeds" or hell demons are trying to take over the world and are using humans as a vehicle to "cross over." We first meet John when he is trying to stop a hell demon from burrowing its way through a teenage girl's stomach.<br /><br />Constantine is well versed on half-breeds. He actually died once and saw them when he went to hell so he is well aware of the constant conflict that rages between heaven and hell. It isn't some distant, unfathomable struggle; it is being played out in the here-and-now, with the souls of human beings as the battleground. John is certain that he will eventually go to hell, so he spends his life playing the role of the reluctant hero - hoping against hope that he can buy his way into heaven.<br /><br />His efforts however, seem to be in vain. It's not that John is a bad person; it's just that he lacks faith as the angelic Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) - complete with sprouting wings - hastens to tell him. So the bitter protagonist goes through life hoping for redemption and thinking of hell, while also being haunted by various machinations of the devil. The unsavory Balthazar (Gavin Rossdale) is out to send Constantine to the dark depths forever and delights in the news that our valiant hero is dying.<br /><br />John eventually gets some help from intrepid, gutsy cop, Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz). Angela is also a visionary, and she's fraught with sadness after her sister Isabel - a self-confessed Catholic - committed suicide. Angela is positive that Isabel didn't suicide on purpose, but how can she find out for sure?  Perhaps Constantine can help her unlock Isabel's secret and help put her sister's soul to rest. When John finds out that the devil's son has possessed an illegal Mexican immigrant and plans on unleashing hell on earth he prepares to set himself opposite the greatest evil this planet has known.<br /><br />Thematically the movie is pretty much a mess. Suicide, Catholicism, the nature of good and evil, and the origin of sin are all trying to contend for prominence in the story. The film works best when it doesn't take itself too seriously and lets the special effects take over. There's one really cool scene about half way through where Angela is ripped through a building, it looks great but it doesn't make much sense.<br /><br />In fact, most of the special effects - mostly in the form of a lot of splashing water and breaking glass - look like second-rate outtakes from the Matrix movies. They're satisfactory, but they aren't anything special and they don't really push the envelope. Even the hellfire-tinged mirror images of Los Angeles and the hedonistic bowels of a nightclub that caters to both angels and demons look a bit lackluster and not nearly as visually arresting as they could be.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves looks great but he has a habit of mumbling and I found it hard to understand what he was saying some of the time. Leave it to the gorgeous Rachel Weisz who as Angela lends some class to the proceedings. You can't think too much while watching this movie, as the plot makes no sense.<br /><br />Subplots are dropped without explanation, background exposition remains unexplained, and there are some absolutely ludicrous turns of events. However, the film will no doubt appeal to those viewers who are fans of vivid cinematic comic book adaptations, and perhaps also to those who like their horror films tinged with the fanciful and the far-fetched. Mike Leonard July 05.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>The moral values of Christianity have been fostered throughout the Western world for centuries where the good go to heaven and the bad enters hell.  Time on earth is merely a diverging road through which people are influenced in one of two directions - heaven or hell.  The film Constantine spices up this notion with an additional set of thoughts that has been put into action through an agreement between God and Satan.  Earth is a place where God and Satan can act upon the humans by the means of influence, which means they can guide people to their respective direction.  The agreement also states that it is forbidden to act directly with or against the humans.<br /><br />The story unleashes itself on the audience through a teen girl that has been possessed by a demon.  Monstrously, as seen in other horror films such as Exorcist (1973), the girl behaves until John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) arrives to the scene with a cigarette tightly held with the lips.  Constantine places the cigarette on a dresser, as he goes to work on the girl by identifying the demon inside her.  A fight for existence between the planes is commenced between Constantine and the demon, but Constantine knows what he does, as this is something he has done before.  This opening scene is a promise of what is to come, but it does not give away the horrors that Constantine will face later.<br /><br />Misery and distress is eating up Constantine from within, as he discovers that his days are numbered on the earth.  The habit, which began when he was 15, has slowly clogged up his lungs as he is little by little suffocating from the big black lumps inside his lungs that are caused by his smoking.  This makes him seek out Gabriel in order to request a passage to heaven for all the good deeds he has done on earth.  However, Gabriel informs Constantine that he must commit an act of pure goodness without personal gain in order to accomplish such a feat, and as he is already pledged to go to hell it is impossible.  Stuck on earth knowing that he will be torn into pieces in hell for an eternity is too much even for a hardened hero such as Constantine who lights up another cigarette.<br /><br />Through Constantine's calling, the audience gets to meet Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz), who has lost her sister in what the police identify as a suicide, but Angela thinks differently.  Angela's suspicions lead her to seek Constantine's help, as something peculiar seems to be in the works.  However, she has no idea how outlandish the force is that she is about to confront.  Initially, Constantine rejects to help her, but when he notices something sinister luring in the shadows he changes his mind.  Together they are about make a stand against the deadliest assault that earth has ever faced, and they have no choice other than to welcome the coming of the dark forces.<br /><br />Constantine is based on a comic book character, John Constantine, that first appeared in 1985 in Saga Of The Swamp Thing #37, however, eventually he earned himself his own comic book called Hellblazer.  The world of John Constantine is dark and full of despair, which is engulfed in the stale cigarette smell that surrounds him.  Constantine, in essence, is a selfish man that spreads gloom around him, as he is one of very few people that can see the true nature of the human society.  This is a gift he uses to bargain for his life, as he is aware of his future destiny, a destiny he wants to avoid at all costs.<br /><br />The director Francis Lawrence does a good job capturing this dark world of John Constantine.  Lawrence even pokes fun of the cigarette corporations in this film, as he states the obvious that smoking is lethal, which shines through in the final scene.  The camera work is outstanding, as it enhances the dark moments of the story, but it also helps to induce emotions with corresponding scenes.  There is, however, a few awkward moments such as when Keanu Reeves occasionally inhales cigarette smoke as if he was beginner to the habit that he supposedly began at the age of fifteen.  The dark and unexpected world of Constantine opens very well, but this anxiety-ridden tale slowly loses its grip on the audience.  Instead the audience slowly sinks into a comfortable position while they continue to enjoy the roller coaster ride of Constantine.  This hurts the overall cinematic experience, as the horror element slowly is exchanged for some movie clich&eacute;s that erase the unexpected.  In the end, Constantine offers a decent cinematic experience, which offers mostly entertainment and some suspense with a dash of thought.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R6ST52EBN2FK.html">A3R6ST52EBN2FK</a><br/><p>Keanu really does these movies so well.  The opening scenes were some of the most memorable I have ever seen!  The one where he was pulling the demon out of the child was hands down awesome!  I wouldn't say this movie is scary, I would say it's going to be real for those of us who believe in Heaven and hell.  Just kind of makes you think.</p></br><a href="../users/A146D2LYLICNLS.html">A146D2LYLICNLS</a><br/><p>I'll begin by saying that I know nothing about the Constantine comic book story, for the simple fact that I've never been into comic books. Most of the negative reviews here seem to be by those who say the movie does not follow the comic book story, so I'll take their word for it. But for someone like me, I have to judge this movie on its merits alone. And what about its merits? Well, I didn't think it was a complete disaster, but not among the better movies I've seen lately either.<br /><br />Whether Keanu Reeves did justice or not to the character of Constantine will be open to personal interpretation, again, mainly by those who know the comic book story. For the rest of us, it all depends on how much we like (or dislike) Keanu Reeves. If you didn't like him before, this movie won't change your mind about him, put it that way. In some areas he's as wooden as a 2x4, and yet in other areas he isn't. I've never quite figured out the mystery of Keanu Reeves. In any event, I thought he was adequate as Constantine. No, he won't win an Oscar for his performance, but this movie wasn't made to win any Oscars. Just one of the things to keep in mind as you enter the theater.<br /><br />One of the things this movie has going for it is the special effects. The scenes where Constantine travels to Hell are simply awesome, no doubt about it. The rest of the special effects are pretty much standard stuff. I also liked the way the movie has a nocturnal feel to it, with most shots of the city taking place at night, when the scary stuff usually happens in this world.<br /><br />In terms of other performances, I'll agree with other reviewers that Rachel Weisz does a nice job in her role. She's able to make us feel for her character and displays a depth not very common in that type of female role in other movies, where the main purpose is to just look pretty for the camera. But the real star has gotta be the ever-so-underrated and ever-so-underused Tilda Swinton as Gabriel. She isn't given very much screen time, but when she does come on screen, it's pure magic. Why this talented actress hasn't gotten bigger roles is beyond me (if you want to see a movie that fully allows her to show her talent, watch "Orlando" or "The Beach").<br /><br />"Constantine" does have its flaws though. For one, many parts of the script are cliched to death. Case in point, Constantine's geeky sidekick who ends up saving his a** and becomes a minor hero when Constantine runs out of bullets. Looks very familiar, huh? That's because it is, done hundreds of times before. The other problem I have with "Constantine" is that it tries too hard at times to replicate classic horror flicks such as "The Exorcist." A perfect example is at the beginning of the movie with the girl and the demon. As one is watching this, they are almost expecting the infamous pea soup to fly out of her mouth. I don't have a problem with paying homage to other movies, but this is overdone to the point of trying to copy it. Sorry, there is only ONE "The Exorcist."<br /><br />All in all, I would hesitantly recommend "Constantine." While not very memorable and quite disposable, it has its good points. Was I presented with an outstanding quality movie? No, I wasn't. But was I entertained for 2 hours? Yes, I was. Just put your brain on neutral, grab that popcorn, and remember to not take it too seriously.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>I have not read the Constantine comics, my only experience with him comes from reading the Sandman graphic novel series as well as the miniseries Love Street, so I do not know how faithful to the character or story this movie is.<br /><br />That said, on its own, the movie was so-so. The story was okay, but it could have been explored more with better writing, I found the ending to be somewhat cliched.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>As an on-again, off-again follower of the Vertigo comic this is based upon, I was all geared up to hate it mightily before it had even spun up in the DVD player. With that said, it fares somewhat better than I'd expected. It isn't a raging success story, but it's not a tragic insult to the rich, lengthy source material either. Keanu Reeves is a horrible choice for the lead, no doubt about that - where the funny book Constantine is a complex, witty, bitter but charismatic subculture hero, Keanu's interpretation is as nuanced as a bag of bricks. I don't know how much I can fault the actor for that - after all, he's been playing dress-up with the same character for two decades now - but regardless of where the blame lies, he lacks the unspoken authenticity that role needs to get off the ground. Fortunately, the blow is softened somewhat by a dynamite intro sequence that may as well have been ripped straight from the pages of the comic and a decent, if indulgent, central storyline. With a full-blown war between heaven and hell at its core, it would've been very easy to get overly adventurous with the film's scope, but it wisely maintains a short focal range and that keeps things mostly grounded. It won't be finding a home on anyone's top ten list, and it's not easy to look past Keanu being Keanu (with Shia freaking LaBeouf crammed in as a throwaway sidekick), but the tone is right and the special effects work is a grand success. Not nearly what it could've been, but also not what I feared it would become.</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>Constantine was a very pleasant surprise. All the warning flags were up: a much-changed Alan Moore comic book premise (shifted from the UK to LA), a music video director and Keanu Reeves reunited with his dire Chain Reaction co-star Rachel Weisz. Luckily the changes take, the director actually knows how to tell a story and play a scene and Rachel Weisz has learned to act a little in the intervening years. It's damned hero (even Tilda Swinton's rather wonderful Archangel Gabriel tells him "You're f****d.") trying to buy his way into heaven by `deporting' demons is worthy of a franchise of his own, and the film is far more imaginative and entertaining than you'd expect. It's just surprising that, with lines like "God's just a kid with an ant farm," the fundies didn't firebomb the theatres that played it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>Fortunately a few years back my son discovered comic books. At least the card sets that were coming out about that time. In so doing, I helped him to find out what was behind all of those cards and found myself immersed once again in the brightly colored world of comics. Except that I soon discovered that comics were no longer a children's art form but a whole other world of graphic storytelling and imagery that was unlike anything out there with the exception of film. Tales of heaven and hell battling it out for the souls of humans, secret government agencies that allowed people to extract revenge on those who had done them wrong and heroes that actually killed people because they felt it was in the interest of society were all present. And so was John Constantine.<br /><br />The comic series HELLBLAZER was the story of John Constantine. And unfortunately I never found myself drawn to it. As written by Garth Ennis, it took on a legendary status among fans and helped to increase the popularity of DC's Vertigo brand, a home for more adult oriented comics like this and SANDMAN. When I heard it was going to be made into a film I was interested. And after watching this film, I may have to take the chance of picking up some of the trade paperback copies of the series.<br /><br />The film opens with John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) being called to a tenement apartment where a young Hispanic girl has been possessed. With the knowledge he possesses, Constantine is able to bring the demon out of the young girl and send it back to Hell. But something was different here. It seemed that the demon was about to enter our realm and leave its own.<br /><br />We are next introduced to a woman who dreams of another leaping to her death from the top of a building. It turns out it wasn't a dream at all and police detective Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) saw the death of her twin sister. Called to the scene, she seeks solace from a priest later hoping that he will allow her sister to be buried in consecrated ground. At that time, her path crosses with Contantine.<br /><br />Constantine is at the same church talking about the gamble between God and the devil which allowed them to put man's own free will at stake. Either side might try and influence the actions of man, but neither was allowed to be on this plane. Someone is trying to break that deal and Constantine wants to find out whom.<br /><br />The one fault of the film is in assuming we know all there is to know about Constantine and his battles here on earth. It is at this point that we finally begin to get a glimpse of what transpired in the past as Constantine and the angel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) discuss John's past and his desire to do good in the hopes of changing God's mind into allowing him admittance into Heaven.  More details of this transpire later in the film.<br /><br />Eventually Constantine's and Dodson's paths cross once again and they are led down the road that will help them both discover who was behind not only the death of Dodson's sister but the attempt to enter this mortal plane as well. It's a long path that leads them both, literally, to hell and back, but the journey they take is one filled with danger, fear and a believable story that draws the viewer in.<br /><br />The story itself here makes the film, offering a battle of good and evil on this plane that was formulated in the beginning with God and the devil. No balance of power is discussed, no self righteous name calling is produced, simply the battle that is fought is brought to our doorstep with all the souls on Earth hanging in the balance.<br /><br />The weakest point is Keanu Reeves. While I enjoy his work and think of him as a more accomplished actor than many give him credit for, he seem far too Neoish here. After three MATRIX movies, I see him in black and think of him there once more. He does a good job, as does Weisz, but I still have that mental image of him.<br /><br />The movie is well made with some great CGI effects that startle and frighten. The images of Hell are what one would expect as are the demons. But all are done with quality here.<br /><br />CONSTANTINE may not be the greatest movie ever made. But it is one movie that will entertain while you watch. And it may cause a few conversations to rise concerning God, the devil, Heaven and Hell. What more could you ask for in a movie?</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>In Los Angeles, chain-smoking John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is a supernatural exorcist detective who went to hell originally but got his life back as now he hunts for demons and evil spirits to do good for heaven. After a mysterious suicide, Officer Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) helps Constantine battle the forces of evil.<br /><br />A well-made and well-acted if not entirely faithful adaptation of the popular cult DC/Vertigo comic book "Hellblazer: John Constanstine". It's a mix of H.P. Lovecraft-esque horror, fantasy and action combined with some dazzling special effects and an intriguing story, the main character is quite a complex and tragic hero that shows us the way to hell and heaven in this movie. It's a fascinating and dark film that's both fun and serious at the same time that i still recommended despite some flaws.<br /><br />This 2-Disc DVD has great extras like audio commentary, music video, trailers, deleted scenes with alternate ending, still galleries and featurettes.<br /><br />Also recommended: "The Exorcist", "Sin City", "Batman Begins", "The Crow", "Blade Runner", "Demons", "The Omen (1976)", "Daredevil", "Batman (1989)", "Batman Returns", "Evilspeak", "Ghostbusters", "Spawn (Animated)", "A Nightmare on Elm Street", "Hellraiser", "Hellbound: Hellraiser 2", "Silent Hill", "Dreamscape", "The Exorcism of Emily Rose", "V For Vendetta", "In The Mouth of Madness", "From Beyond", "End of Days", "Underworld", "Blade Trilogy", "Night Watch", "Day Watch", "Vampire Hunter D", "Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust", and "Ghost Rider".</p></br><a href="../users/A3VI2VETB90ZG5.html">A3VI2VETB90ZG5</a><br/><p>If you're going to watch this movie, you've really got to watch it in HD! This "Constantine" HD DVD exhibits some of the most outstanding visual sequences you'll find in a demon movie, or otherwise - way cool stuff! The transfer is very clean and top-notch.<br /><br />The Dolby TrueHD soundtrack is a great feature to enhance this otherwise thematic audio track: the dialog is as if spoken in the public library, and all of the demon encounters are as if you're smack in the middle of the action. That's just the style though, but this "quiet dialog" style is the sort of thing which makes me want to get it over with or go to sleep - one of the two...overall the movie does sound great.<br /><br />The whole demon movie genre doesn't do much for me...never really did. The chanting, the touching, and the controversial symbols that bring out the people who like to make a big to-do about anything controversial - it's all too much for me. These are typical features which lend themselves to predictability, but if these elements aren't there, then it isn't a demon movie anymore - a catch 22. Does this mean that once you've seen this kind of movie you've seen 'em all? I think it does [for me].<br /><br />The good news here is that "Constantine" is very modern, it's extremely huge in production value, and it has some awesome visual appeal that's fresh enough to make this movie quite an entertaining film.<br /><br />There's tons of features form behind the story, to additional footage (deleted scenes), a music video, two feature commentaries by two groups of two of four different people, teaser and theatrical trailers, and an IME with Director Francis Lawrence.<br /><br />I recommend "Constantine" (mostly for the special effects).</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>Constantine was an unusual character for a comic book, which explains why the DC/Vertigo comic book "Hellblazer" was rather unusual, so it is not surprising that this 2005 film is a bit different as well.  However, "Hellblazer" fans may well find the changes in the character to outweigh the fact John Constantine has been brought to the big screen and be disappointed.  But then they already know that from having seen director Francis Lawrence's movie in the theater.  What are left are those who never read "Swamp Thing" or "Hellblazer" and are drawn by Kenau Reeves being in the film to check out the DVD.<br /><br />Basically, what those viewers need to know about the hero is as follows.  John Constantine became involved with the occult when he was a youngster, and has always had a problem in that he was never really as good as he thought that he was.  Being cocky and brash works well when you are making deals with the minions of Hell, but can be problematic when you are trying to exorcize demons from little girls.  But Constantine can do magic, although he usually exaggerates what he is actually capable of doing and the legends about him are more impressive than his actual accomplishments.  He also happens to be dying of lung cancer, so whatever he is going to do in this world he has to ge done relatively soon.<br /><br />The tagline for "Constantine" encapsulates the characters situation as: "Hell wants him.  Heaven won't take him.  Earth needs him."  We eventually get a glimpse of Hell, which is, visually at least, an ongoing nuclear firestorm that constitutes a memorable modern version of Dante's Inferno, but for most of this film Hell is in the shadows.  Constantine (Reeves) has been busy sending half-demons back to Hell when he is not busy smoking himself to death, but now full demons are showing up on earth.  This is a violation of the agreement between God and Lucifer, so something big and bad is brewing.  The focal point for Constantine's investigation is the sudden suicide ofa mental patient, whose twince sister, Angela (Rachel Weisz), is a police detective (andt therefore a professional realist who will have trouble believing what Constantine has to say).<br /><br />"Constantine" is more of a horror film than a comic book film, even with the set-up of the title character as something of a superhero.  Cinematically it is clearly going for more of a sense of film noir than we normally get in either genre, which is an interesting and effective visual style (previously Lawrence had done only music videos).  Unfortunately, the characters and plot are not up to the images (this is another movie where the best special effects pretty much show up in the trailer).  The problem may well be not just that viewers have to be brought up to speed on the character of Constantine in a way that is unnecessary with the first rank comic book heroes such as Batman and Spider-Man, but that you have to have more of an appreciation for Catholic theology than you get from having read "The Da Vinci Code."  The again, the Bible tends to see that great battle in terms of black and white, while the world of Constantine is pretty much gray (with blood red splatters).  After all, the angelic Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) does not seem particularly nice for a heavenly being (which gets us back to your understanding of Catholic theology) and not that different from Balthazar (Gavin Rossdale).<br /><br />Then again the problem could be as simple as the casting of Reeves as the reluctant hero dealing with his curse.  Reeves has a definite look in this film, but it is not the look of John Constantine.  More importantly, the character is too different from the one in the comic book.  Granted, you have to have read "Hellblazer" to know that, but I am here to argue that the caustic S.O.B. of the comic book would work better in this storyline than what Reeves provides, especially when Satan himself (Peter Stormare) shows up for a chat.  Whether he intended to or not, the way Reeves plays Constantine is just too much like Neo in "The Matrix," which is wrong on several key levels.  Still, given the visual strengths of the production and the way Keeves wants to go with the character maybe the greatest fault with this movie lies with the basic story that Kevin Brodbin came up with (Brodbin and Frank Cappello did the screenplay) from the comic books written by Jamie Delano and Garth Ennis.  There should have been a better way of making this all work.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C2P5HX5RLPAX.html">A1C2P5HX5RLPAX</a><br/><p>Keanu gives his usual performance, not Oscar worthy but entertaining. We were not totally familiar with the comic books so we were kind of lost in the beginning as to what was going on, who was bad and who was good (although that is never totally clear). The special effects and camera work are marvellous. Djimon Hounsou as always is beautiful. Rachel Weisz regretably was weaker than usual and is unbelieavable as a cop. Another notable acter in this film is the beautiful Tilda Swinton. She was beautifully cunning as the fallen angel Gabrielle. This film is worth the entertaining rental value.</p></br><a href="../users/AIBRTGBN07D6A.html">AIBRTGBN07D6A</a><br/><p>I've never read Hellblazer before, but I am a comic fan and thought maybe I'd enjoy this movie. I was wrong.  This movie had some of the worst acting I've seen, especially by Keanu Reeves and Shia LaBeouf.  Aside from that, it contained a storyline that was just too much for a 2 hour movie.  It's obvious that Constantine's life is more complicated than can fit in their time slot, so it appears they left many things out and tried to pack in as much action as possible without explaining very much.<br /><br />Overall, the storyline was incredibly boring, and despite some decent special effects, the action was even more yawn-inducing. This is the first movie in my entire life I've ever fallen asleep in.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z.html">A3D2VIUT2HWP0Z</a><br/><p>SINGLE DISC DVD:(19 july 2005) The Film is awesome.Sound is great, and the film is a superb watch. Extras are at a minimum on the single disc version. I plan to get the double disc version ASAP. But being able to watch again the superb sequences in this horror film is great. Some people define horror as "Slash/gore/hack" etc, but a series of great supernatural elements are worked out in this film. The layers in the film are manifold, and they repay additional watching.<br />I still find the book that came out to be the best explanation of the background in the film.<br />The criticism of the film as a "Bad  Adaptation" of the comic is just silly ... this is a film, the comic is the comic.<br />The characters are defined very well. Both "John" and the detective are world weary characters who are trying to resolve issues in their lives.<br />The best element on the supernatural side is the detail... its damn near perfect. Hopefully the two disc  version will have some extra  cool stuff as well.<br /><br />*************************************<br /><br />I have been waiting for this film ever since I saw the first trailers in 2004. And I was definitely NOT  disappointed.<br />It is an absolutely great rollercoaster ride, and all the edgy bits just flow together superbly, and Keanu proves once again he can deliver the goods.<br />The film works  brilliantly script wise, and brings in many supernatural ideas, that are articulated well thanks to great FX. Rachel Weisz is definitely a great choice for the role she fulfills.<br />As a literally  World weary specialist in the occult, Keanu takes us through a journey to hell and back.<br />For myself, I found this  film to be more visceral than cerebral, in a very positive way. If you really need some explanation of what has happened, I can highly recommend the book tie-in, but read AFTER you see the movie. You will not be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>I've never read the Hellblazer comic, so fans looking to compare the two can move on.<br /><br />Are they gone?  Okay, let's talk about religion.<br /><br />I suspect a lot of folks didn't like this movie because they didn't understand it.  And the viewers who did understand it are probably offended by it.  Appreciating the film requires a pretty good grasp of pop-theology and Roman Catholicism, a combination you don't find in many people besides gamers.<br /><br />John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is a former suicide that has been given another chance to walk amongst the living.  Like most pulp heroes, John is a chain smoker.  The twist here is that all the supposedly harmless smoking is a symbol of John's temptation by the vices of the flesh: as a result of his bad habit, he's dying from lung cancer.<br /><br />Tragic, yes.  But John knows for a fact he's going to hell.  You see, Catholic doctrine dictates that those who commit suicide go to hell.  This probably had to do a lot with the fact that martyrs in medieval times were torturing themselves in extremis until they died in twisted efforts to purify themselves.  And really, religion doesn't work all that well without living worshippers.  Thus the edict against suicide.<br /><br />During John's brief experimentation with killing himself, he was in hell for two minutes.  Two minutes is an eternity in hell, which looks like wherever you happen to be before you crossed over, only under the perpetual flames of a nuclear blast. Underneath all those flames and soot are the damned, gnawing and clawing each other.  It's all very Dantean.<br /><br />And yet John has been tasked with maintaining the balance, an eternal war beyond God's angels and the Devil's demons.  Neither is allowed on this plane of existence, so half-breeds roam the Earth instead.  Angels take the guise of humans (sans wings except for those who can see them) and demons possess people.<br /><br />The Exorcist established that possessed people stick to the ceiling and have blue veins and bad teeth.  John takes the roll of an exorcist, ensuring that the demons get too strong a foothold in our world.  Except that one of them tries to "break out" of a possessed little girl, which is a violation of the Divine Order.<br /><br />As an aside, the term "plane" was brought into popular culture through Michael Moorcock and his Elric series.  The movie uses the term liberally and it's unlikely that anyone but gamers will get it.<br /><br />The plot gets twisty from there.  Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz), a pretty cop, has been unknowingly gunning down demons-in-human-form and feeling pretty guilty about it.  Turns out she's psychic. So is her twin, Isabel. And in order for the antichrist to return, he must be born through a psychic and ripped out of the womb by the Spear of Destiny.  That'd be the spear that pierced Christ's side.<br /><br />Whew, that's a lot to take in.<br /><br />All this culminates in John having to work twice as hard as he realizes demons aren't just trying to get into our world, they're already here and killing off the good guys.  After Angela's sister Isabel commits suicide to avoid becoming the antichrist's mother, Angela and John team up to try to stop the ensuing invasion.<br /><br />It soon becomes clear that the lines of good and evil are not so clearly drawn: angels do wicked things and devils come to the rescue. Waitaminute, haven't we seen this before?<br /><br />If it sounds familiar, it's because The Prophecy covered the same ground with the same characters: Gabriel, Lucifer, and a regular Joe who lost his faith in the middle.  The acting was better.  Lucifer was just plain creepy (played by Viggo Mortensen).  And Gabriel was played by Christopher Walken, who just rocks on toast in everything he's in.<br /><br />Instead, we get Peter Stormare, a Goodfellas version of Lucifer.  Tilda Swinton plays Gabriel, whose chief attribute is being androgynous-looking (see the movie Orlando). There are other quirky characters playing one-dimensional comic book types (including Pruitt Taylor Vince as a psychic priest), but they're all there to support John and get killed so he's really, really pissed when he fights the main bad guy. And of course there's the 21st century Kevin Costner of our time, Keanu Reeves.  Reeves' mumbling tested my patience and I missed out on a few important plot points because of it.  But he's merely a canvas for a bigger movie and it's unfair to overly criticize the film when ultimately Constantine's supposed to be a shlub with a bad habit.<br /><br />The director (Francis Lawrence) has fits of brilliance, including a scene where the holder of the Spear of Destiny walks down a road, causing a herd of cows to drop as he passes. Or Angela being sucked through wall after wall of a skyscraper, Forgotten-style, with John in hot pursuit. Or when John and Angela stand in front of a statue of the Virgin Mary to face off against hundreds of demons hovering in the darkness, just out of sight.<br /><br />It's easy to dismiss the movie as Van Helsing with demons.  Yes, there is a holy shotgun blowing up demons.  Yes, they do bless the sprinkler system and turn it into holy water.  So what?  This is pulp noir, dark stuff in Los Angeles, the City of Angels.  That Constantine dishes up a round of butt kicking along with its crazy theology only adds to the fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>First, let me encourage anyone seeing this film to stay until the very end of the closing credits.  Yes, there is a bit of an add on at the very tail.  Walk out early and you'll miss it.<br /><br />I have to start off by confessing that I have never read any of the Hellrazer comics, so I had no prior expectations going into this film.  My experience of the film, therefore, will necessarily be different from those who had contesting conceptions of John Constantine.  All in all, I very much enjoyed this movie, though with a couple of major reservations.<br /><br />First, the good.  This is a great looking film, with a host of superb special effects and sets.  The Los Angeles of the film is very much the same Los Angeles of TV's ANGEL, dark, dingy, inelegant, the antithesis of the L.A. of Randy Newman's video "I Love L.A."  I liked the basic premise of the film:  John Constantine is an exorcist who is damned because he killed himself when younger before being resuscitated two minutes later, but enough in Catholic theology to make him permanently damned.  Again, parallels with TV's ANGEL, where the hero has committed unspeakable crimes, has become an irretrievably damned vampire, and yet as a vampire with a soul has regained a conscience and strives to balance out the evil he has brought into the world.  Fans of the comics will point out that the comic preceded the TV show, but I will point out two things.  First, it is entirely possible that the comic had some influence on the show (creator Joss Whedon is an avid comics fan).  Second, the TV show could have exerted influence on the movie (in literary circles it is not uncommon to read articles like "W. B. Yeats influence on Blake," the idea being that the later poet, by appropriating and reinterpreting aspects of the earlier poet's work, influences the way that their work continues to be perceived).  I think the parallels will be obvious and difficult to ignore for anyone familiar with the TV show and watching the movie with or without prior knowledge of the comic.  Another great positive in the movie is the wonderful presence of Rachel Weisz, a beautiful and talented actress who brings far more ability to the role than is required by the genre.  Peter Stomare also has an interesting turn as Lucifer.  Most of the cast, in fact, is excellent.  The story was interesting as well.  In fact, one of the big problems I have with movies that depart from reality is that usually the premises of the film fall apart within only a few seconds thought.  Take THE ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND.  An interesting film, but if you think about the central premise, the absurdity of it becomes blatant almost immediately, quite apart from whether it is possible.  The very notion that memories can be isolated from all of their social connections is silly in the extreme (and in that movie, the Kate Winslet character, sans memories, goes to the apartment building of her former boyfriend, only to be recognized and addressed by someone who still possessed all of his memories-in other words, you can't erase memories not simply because it isn't physiologically possible, but it isn't sociologically possible).  But CONSTANTINE, while if you pushed it really hard might not hold up, nonetheless holds up if you push it only a little bit, which is much better than most other films in the genre.  From beginning to end, it was an enjoyable story.<br /><br />Now the bad.  First and foremost there is Keanu Reeves, one of the great mysteries of the cinema.  He is relatively likable, and definitely attractive, but he is without any possible doubt one of the least talented leading actors in the history of the movies.  He is profoundly inept at delivering lines, and lacking in the powerful screen presence that some other untalented leading actors possess.  For instance, John Wayne was not a great thespian, but he had an overwhelming presence onscreen that more than made up for a lack of acting ability.  Many actors bring more to a role than they find on a page.  Reeves leaves on the page much that he should have incarnated in his performance.  His wooden delivery of lines is astonishing for its sheer awfulness.  I'm baffled as to why he was cast in the role.  Perhaps others turned it down, but I kept wondering what the movie would have been like with a Hugh Jackman or Jeremy Northram or Christian Bale would have been like.  Or even a good actor who isn't quite right for the role, but has considerable ability, like Edward Norton.  Or even Mark Wahlberg.  I will say this:  this is at least a better movie than the last two MATRIX movies, though I'm not sure that Reeves can be given any of the credit.  Far an away, Reeves is the single biggest thing wrong with this film.  I was also very disappointed with the film's use of Tilda Swinton, whom I have long considered one of the most underutilized actresses in film.  As the mildly androgynous Gabriel (I wonder if her role in ORLANDO put the casting director in mind of her) she is uncharacteristically awful.  Not to worry though, she will be back later in the year in the plumy role of Jadis the White Witch in THE LION, THE WITCH, AND THE WARDROBE, the top fantasy film of the year.<br /><br />Also like ANGEL, the movie is stuffed with utterly awful theology.  On the TV show, I was as someone trained in philosophy utterly appalled at the Buffyverse idea of a detachable soul as well as other randomly utilized theological ideas.  In CONSTANTINE, there is some adherence to traditional Catholic theology, especially in regard to suicide, but much of the rest of the film embraces some of the most condemned heresies in church history.  In particular, the film depends on a na?ve Manichaeism which depends on a dualistic vision of the universe as divided between God and Devil, whereas Christianity whether Catholic or Protestant is nondualistic, evil being conceived not as an entity actual in itself, but negatively as being the absence of God.  (BUFFY and ANGEL suffer from the same Manichaeism).  What I find troubling about this is the randomness of the world view in play.  The creators pick and choose among the ideas that they need, and in the end the film suffers as a result.  All films involve some decisions about the kind of world in which the film will take place.  I'm just bothered when the creation of that world is especially arbitrary.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed this film, and while I can understand the criticisms of it by those who come to it from the comics, I think that many of those who are unfamiliar with it will probably enjoy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>Constantine is a man, gifted with supernatural skills; he is able to look inside far beyond the quotidian `s reality , allowing him to establish a direct link with secret forces, which has to deal with the same hell  .<br /><br />Through a meticulous and descriptive script, we will notice his dramatis personae.

He has the ability to see real demons roaming the Earth & possessing the living. As the film unfolds the viewer finds out that Constantine rids the planet of these demons to buy his way into Heaven. It seems Constantine at an early age was able to see these demons that no one else can. His parents send him to the local nuthouse for a severe psych evaluation & testing (shock therapy). At the age of 15, Johnnie commits suicide & gets a glimpse of eternal damnantion in Hell.

Unfortunately, the film's screenplay, which was written by Kevin Brodbin and Frank Cappello, fails to capture the spirit of the books. Rather than keeping the characters as they are in the books, the writers have taken liberties that minimalize the effect of the story. In the books, John Constantine is a blond-haired British anti-hero. Here he's played by Keanu Reeves, with black hair and an American accent. Normally I wouldn't complain about such trivial details, but the character of Constantine is further changed from his comic book counterpart. This brings me to one of the film's greatest strengths; it's original and unafraid to make changes. Breaking away from many of the conventions found in the "superhero" genre, Constantine dares to be somber and politically incorrect. Can you name any other "comic book" film where the hero has cancer, is suicidal, and generally disliked by everyone that he associates with? Nope, I didn't think so.<br /><br />Demon hunter and exorcist, John Constantine has never been a popular guy, but his talents are in high demand. Constantine has the ability to see damned spirits and the knowledge necessary to send them back to Hell. The only problem is that he's a chain-smoking, cynical, selfish S.O.B. and he's just been diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer. When Constantine is contacted by detective Angela Dodson to investigate the apparent suicide of her twin sister, Constantine discovers a demonic conspiracy to bring about the apocalypse. Relying on a small group of demon hunters, occultists, and half-breeds (a term for Earth-bound angels and demons), Constantine wages a war against the Devil. But it's only a matter of time before his cancer overpowers him and the sins of his past decide his fate in the afterlife. Will John Constantine be sent to Hell for his misdeeds, or will the gates of Heaven part for this proud and defiant sinner? In the battle between two worlds, between Heaven and Hell, between all that's good and all that's evil, between the holy and the profane... John Constantine fights for the middle ground.<br /><br />The big budget action/thriller features an atypical cast, which with the exception of odd man out Keanu Reeves, fits the film's anarchic atmosphere perfectly. Though Keanu gives a fine performance, his looks and his mannerisms never seem right for the character, who was supposedly modeled after Clint Eastwood as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015XHQTE">Dirty Harry</a> and Sting, the lead singer of the Police. The cast includes Rachel Weisz as Angela and Isabel Dodson, Shia LaBeouf as Chas, Tilda Swinton as Gabriel, Djimon Honsou as Papa Midnite, Gavin Rossdale as Balthazar, and Peter Stormare as Satan. Each member of the diverse cast gives a worthy performance, but the standout here is indie film star Tilda Swinton, who plays the beatific and androgynous angel Gabriel with a delicious irony.<br />As has often been the case with films based upon characters created by Alan Moore, Constantine became a showcase for the latest computer effects rather than focusing on the deeply flawed characters that made the books so successful.<br />With the film's blasphemous overtones, it's no wonder that many religious groups were up in arms about the portrayal of Biblical figures. Still the film serves up about as much theological discussion as similarly ironic film RoboCop did for discussions about law enforcement, which is fine by me. Not every film needs to take itself so seriously and Constantine doesn't. Another flaw of the film is the direction, which feels both forced and mechanical in its execution. Directed by music video auteur Francis Lawrence, who focuses on creating a visually stunning but emotionally devoid alternate reality populated by all manner of miscreants and lost souls. If you're looking for a thought provoking film about redemption through spirituality, then Constantine will likely disappoint. But if what you seek is a fast-paced thriller with lots of action and witty dialogue, then Constantine is for you.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1563896974">Swamp Thing: The Curse</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1563890526">Hellblazer: Original Sins</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1563891506">John Constantine, Hellblazer: Dangerous Habits</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416503439">War Lord John Constantine</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HEWEGC">The Exorcist - The Complete Anthology</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ATQYWY">Kolchak: The Night Stalker</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NQRR1Q">The Ninth Gate</a></p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>John Constantine is a chain-smoking exorcist with only a few months left to live.  Although he knows that he is already destined to spend eternity in hell for a mortal sin he committed in the past, John is still attempting to find redemption by dedicating himself to battling the demonic forces that exist just beneath the surface of our known reality and which have lately been making a greater effort to cross over from their world to ours.<br /><br />I imagine that the Catholic Church must be rather pleased with this film,  especially considering the black eye it suffered at the hands of Dan Brown's "The Da Vinci Code."  Here the incantations and paraphernalia of the Roman church have a great deal of efficacy in keeping the demonic forces Constantine encounters subdued and at bay.<br /><br />Strictly as a movie and not as a theological document, "Constantine" is a slightly better-than-average demonic thriller that goes back and forth between the world of humans and the shadowy netherworld inhabited by angels and demons and even a few creatures that fall somewhere in between.  In a role not all that far removed from the one he played in the "Matrix" movies, Keanu Reeves once again functions as the flawed Everyman hero whose job it is to save humanity from a fate worse than, in this case, eternal death.  We're more willing to accept the silliness of the premise knowing we have Reeves to guide us along the movie's path.  The special effects are impressive for the most part, with special credit going to the art designers for their imaginative view of hell (which looks much like a city after it's been destroyed by a nuclear explosion).  The film is, admittedly, too long and the nonsense quotient begins to run dangerously high long about the last half hour. But "Constantine" is, overall, sufficiently imaginative to keep us interested for most of its duration.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF.html">A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF</a><br/><p>I never bothered to watch this movie until the HD DVD came out and now I know why.  While the movie is not terrible, there is absolutely nothing memorable about it.  I just watched it last night and am having a hard time recalling the plot.  Keanu Reeves plays John Constantine, a man condemned to Hell for trying to kill himself and trying to attain redemption by banishing demons back to the underworld.  I like Keanu, but most of the time he reminds me of Neo, his character in the Matrix trilogy.  And in the Matrix movies, he reminded me of his character Ted in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure.  The rest of the cast, including Rachel Weisz, was fine, the special effects were good, and there were even a few funny moments.  I was never too bored while watching it, but in the end it left me feeling empty.  The HD DVD transfer is one of the better ones, but this movie is a rental at best.</p></br><a href="../users/A15Q9YEG1XPEJN.html">A15Q9YEG1XPEJN</a><br/><p>Keanu Reeves will undoubtedly never win an Academy Award for acting. That is actually a shame, because I think he delivers some really great performances. He's not as annoyingly flashy as Tom Cruise, as oddly lovable as Tom Hanks, or as physically expressive as Brad Pitt, but Reeves plays his characters as extensions of himself (which, by the way, as an actor myself, is the only way any human being can actually play a role) and his own internalization of his emotions. Reeves' eyes tell the story, not his face. The way he might hold his head provides you insight that another actor might display on his face.<br /><br />All that said, Reeves' portrayal of John Constantine is as unique as his character of Jack Traven (Speed) was. (While I love the first Matrix, I was sorely disappointed by the director's vision and delivery of the sequels). Reeves delivers a great performance in Constantine.<br /><br />John Constantine has always been tortured by the gift of seeing the evil that lurks just outside of the vision of most all other humans. When it became too much for him as a teenager, he committed suicide. He was brought back 2 minutes later, empowered with the ability to return "halfbreed" demons to Hell when they overstepped their boundaries. Unfortunately, he was also damned to hell for having committed suicide. Constantine continues to protect humans from the half breed demons in an effort to save his own soul.<br /><br />With really cool sets and a script that keeps you guessing (with the exception of the ending), Constantine delivers a moody and surreal landscape for this world and that of hell. The demons are unique but not particularly scary. The scary stuff is the Biblical references.<br /><br />This is based on a comic from Vertigo (DC) Comics. It's a dark film and I can only suppose that the comic was equally so.<br /><br />I think the script was very engaging and tight up until the end. The ending of the film seems to take the easy way out. Whereas we see Constantine perform a painful and drawn out<br /><br />exorcism early on, the final exorcism - with ostensibly a far more powerful demon - takes place relatively quickly and easily.<br /><br />I love Tilda Swinton (wonderful as usual) as the angel Gabriel and Peter Stormare as Lucifer (though his performance was not so much evil as it was weirdly silly). Rachel Weitz was really interesting as the female lead. She made me completely forget her forgettable performance in The Mummy.<br /><br />I also particularly loved the "move ins" to Weitz's character that Reeves does on several occasions. Watch the film and you'll see what i'm talking about.<br /><br />This is not your standard fare - but it is not a rip off of The Exorcist or any other film (though it may share some similarity with Prophecy). Far more engaging than the Order or any other film of that nature, Constantine is leaps and bounds above those other films. It is due to a decent director, but really good performances by Reeves, Weitz and Swinton and an awesome set designer and cinematographer.<br /><br />May not be everyone's cup of tea - but if you give it a chance you'll like it.</p></br><a href="../users/A29SJTG21BVWF4.html">A29SJTG21BVWF4</a><br/><p>This movie is one of those theologian movies that are in the middle of the road. Neather bad or good.  But is entertaining enough to watch more than once.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>So what's wrong with 'Constantine'?  Contrary to my low expectations, it turned out not unentertaining film.  You get solid production designs, you get moody photography by Philippe Rousselot ('River Runs Through it'), and you get an interesting story (at least, it looked so at the beginning).  The opening ten minutes are very good even though it looks as if the ideas are borrowed from that Linda Blair film.  I don't know whether or nor Keanu Reeves can really act, but you still get Rachel Weisz and Tilda Swinton.  So why people, I mean some people, hate it?<br /><br />[WEAK SCRIPT] That's it, if you don't like Hollywood movies, 90 per cent of the reasons is this.  The film, based on graphic novels I don't know, is about John Constantine played by Keanu Reeves, a dismal-looking, chain-smoking, way-too-cynical guy who distrusts people in general.  And he doesn't care if his harsh words hurt the cop Angela (Weisz) whose twin sister has just been found dead.<br /><br />However, we have to believe that it is John Constantine who saves the world from the satanic powers (like 'The Matrix'), and that Angela holds the key to doing this job (like you know what).  To make this ambitious premises work, the screenwriters should have created much more convincing characters than the present ones.  Instead the film largely relies on the cliched ideas -- costly CGIs, gadgets provided by a 'M'-like scientist, and very basic (and misleading) concepts about heaven and hell, or the Catholic Church.<br /><br />[Why?  IT'S TILDA SWINTON HERE!] It is not the actors who cannot act that really look awful among the lackluster movie; it is the actors who can act that suffer from the generic dialogues.  So, it is Tilda Swinton who should have known better than playing Gabriel in ... er ... very unique costumes.  The filmmaker must have decided on casting her after seeing her 'Orlando.'  But 'Orlando' didn't require her to sport a pair of CGI-created wings on her shoulders, which add unexpected campiness to the film.  Rachel Weisz is slightly better -- her role Angela is a much more complex role -- but for all her strong acting as Angela tormented by her sister's death, it is painfully clear that she has not found a right role in Hollywood yet.  And Keanu Reeves?  All I can say is that he shouldn't have used his middle finger to show the character's anger.  If sticking up his finger is the best he can do to be in character, and it's done to Peter Stormare clad in white suit, what can I say?<br /><br />But like I said, he tries to save the day, and we are supposed to see things from his viewpoint.  He has a special power to see things, things in hell in particular; he can fight a bunch of nasty half-devils, and he can introduce us to many visually stunning scenes helped by modern special effects.  But one problem is, it sounds like 'The Matrix' trilogy.</p></br><a href="../users/A20DZX38KRBIT8.html">A20DZX38KRBIT8</a><br/><p>great movie! this is a great movie it has everything, action, exorcisms, demons, angels, great acting.

I don't think any one understands Catholic theology anymore, especially the priests. The movie spouted theology, angelology and eschatolgy, but it doesn't really match anything I know. The plot was hard to follow and had some hard to understand plot lines, but it made some pleasantly surprising turns too. The whole "spear of destiny" idea was very confusing. The characters were very interesting.  At the start, I thought Keanu miscast, but he grew on me. I enjoyed the point the Reeves's character made about believing in the devil. The heroine says, "I don't believe in the devil." Keanu replies, "That's too bad. He's believes in you." The truth is the truth no matter what you believe. It doesn't prove God or satan exists, but it is something to think about.<br /><br />It was fun for a spirtual thriller.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>Constantine marks the feature film debut of music video director Francis Lawrence who, judging by the look of this movie, would like to follow in the footsteps of David Fincher. For his first time out, Lawrence takes on the daunting task of adapting the excellent comic book, Hellblazer. Its main character, John Constantine first appeared in the pages of Swamp Thing, during an illustrious run by Alan Moore. Eventually, Constantine got his own series with the launch of DC Comics' Vertigo line. Jamie Delano was the primary writer and fleshed out the character's backstory, his friends (like Chas the cabbie) and family. These stories typified late `80s comic book horror and provided a bridge between Moore and the next creative heavyweight to tackle the character, Garth Ennis. His run on Hellblazer is where the movie gets most of its material from. Constantine is a chain-smoking, hard-drinking guy suffering from terminal lung cancer. He becomes embroiled in a complex war between Heaven and Hell with humanity caught in the middle.<br /><br />Fans of the comic book are probably not going to like this movie. Constantine is supposed to be world-weary, a sarcastic drunk and womanizer but Reeves doesn't quite pull it off. He presents a more sanitized version of the comic book character and even that feels forced. Another major betrayal of the character is having him wield a gun (a cool-looking crucifix shotgun), something that the Constantine of the comic would never do. Reeves is unable sell the character convincingly and is miscast in this role. Guy Pearce or Clive Owen would have been a much better choice to play Constantine.<br /><br />Despite the miscasting of Reeves and Weisz in the two main roles, Lawrence's take on Constantine is actually quite entertaining, even more so if you haven't read the comic book. However, fans of the series will have problems with the major liberties the filmmakers have taken with the characters - especially Constantine and Chas. Like most comic book adaptations, this film only sprinkles certain elements from the source material, just enough to vaguely resemble it while watering it down for mainstream consumption. It's a shame because in the right hands, Constantine could have been this year's Hellboy instead it's closer to the flawed, missed opportunity of The Punisher.<br /><br />On the first DVD there is an audio commentary by Francis Lawrence, producer Akiva Goldsman and screenwriters Kevin Brodbin and Frank Cappello. Lawrence does his best to keep on topic and actually comment on what we are watching while Goldsman does his best to come off as very annoying and unfunny.<br /><br />Also included is a music video for the song "Passive" by A Perfect Circle. It's pretty standard stuff with the band playing through distorted visuals with lots of clips from the movie.<br /><br />There is also the teaser and theatrical trailer.<br /><br />The catch phrase of the extras on second DVD is how everyone wanted to "stay true to the spirit "of the comic book. Everyone involved makes a point of defending the changes made from comic to film. "Conjuring Constantine" traces the character's origins from The Swamp Thing to Hellblazer. Not surprisingly, Alan Moore and Garth Ennis are not interviewed as I'm sure they'd have a few things to say about the liberal changes made.<br /><br />"The Production from Hell" features Lawrence talking about the pressures of making his first feature film.<br /><br />"Imagining the Underworld" takes a look at the film's version of Hell. Lawrence wanted it to resemble Los Angeles' highway after a nuclear bomb test explosion. Several other special effects set pieces are examined and shown how they were put together.<br /><br />"Constantine Cosmology" examines the role mythology plays in the movie and how it compares to the heroic journey according to the writings of Joseph Campbell.<br /><br />"Foresight: The Power of Pre-Visualization" shows how certain scenes were mapped out in terms of point-of-view, angles, and camera moves via computer animation with an optional audio commentary by Lawrence.<br /><br />Finally, there are four deleted scenes with optional commentary by Lawrence. He talks about why they were cut, usually for reasons of pacing. A character from the comic book, Ellie the demon, was cut from the film and her scene is included.<br /><br />A nice touch with this deluxe edition is the inclusion of a mini-comic book that includes stories by Delano and Ennis.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R8LZYZR3377O.html">A1R8LZYZR3377O</a><br/><p>Keanu Reeves just walking through dialogue while trying to recall "Devils Advocate" is a polite way to critique this apocoliptic mess. I was bored to tears watching this. The makers must have been counting on the sound engineer to liven this thing up. Alot of swoops and loud annoying noises while everyones voice seems to be at a whisper or above(except for a few ridiculous shouts). Wow the angel Gabriel really made sense, and yes I'm being funny. Possibly some decent computer generated things, but its been done better before, or at least in a better film. A bunch of mish mosh with an even worst ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A25ACLV5KPB4W.html">A25ACLV5KPB4W</a><br/><p>This movie was far better than most of the shoot-em-up supernatural eye candy features out there, with a cohesive vision and a plot which made sense and built to a logical and exciting conclusion.<br /><br />This unity of elements (probably made easier because of the established comic book) allows us to really immerse ourselves in the world of John Constantine, a demon hunter who's driven less by morailty and more by a desire to buy his way into Heaven by dint of having accomplished God's work on earth.<br /><br />With a supporting cast of characters that includes the angel Gabriel, Lucifer, and the son of Satan, it's easy to get caught up in the idea of Reeves as a mythological figure who has one foot in the world of spirits. There are many great visual scenes, including a demon made of bugs, a shot in which members of a herd of cattle fall down dead at the approach of the devil's son, a scene in which an alcoholic finds himself unable to coax a drink from a bottle, and a couple of scenes that take place in Hell. The sleek action sequences are varied and on the short side, which is just enough to make their presence felt without feeling like you're caught in the middle of a neverending hail of bullets.<br /><br />The plot involves a new development in the ongoing battle between God and Satan, an escalation that threatens the lives and souls of everyone on earth. Constantine is brought together with a cop (played by Rachel Weisz) to prevent the empowerment of the son of Satan on earth, and shifting alliances among the principals make for interesting twists.<br /><br />Reeves and Weisz turn in serviceable performances, and Tilda Swinton and John Stormare prove to be exceptional casting choices for Gabriel and Lucifer.<br /><br />One final note: if you're the type who considers staying until the credits have rolled to see if there's something extra at the end, I would strongly consider staying to the very end of this one. That's all I'm saying.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>Sadly I missed out on the Hellblazer series by DC Comics under the Vertigo label when this film was first released.  Based on these great graphic novels. Constantine is about a hard-smoking & drinking guy who is not just an exorcist, but a guy who can see the Other Side.  In the film's mythology, both heaven and hell are in place with Earth.  Hell looks like L.A. during a nuclear holocaust.  So what else is new?<br /><br />Anyway, the film does have its share of plotholes which I found distracting.  These guys are scavenging around a junk yard in Mexico when a board breaks and a guy pulls out a knife wrapped in a Nazi flag and immediately becomes possessed by it.  The Sword is explained later in the film but not the Nazi connection.  How did it get there?  Did the Nazis use these artifacts?<br /><br />When our young possessed man walks, cattle fall dead at his feet which is a cool effect but not many others drop dead, just animals.  Huh?  OK, I can live with that.<br /><br />Rachael Weisz is the police detective whose twin sister dies jumping off a building.  I did note in these kinds of movies, glass breaking and lots of water ensue.  Quite interesting how the director uses these ploys to try to evoke mood and mythology.  At times it works, as with the green-eyed cat used by Constantine to check out Hell.  How Rachel's character's twin knows Constantine is never explained, either.<br /><br />Despite the insipid acting of a police detective (I mean, would you be an L.A. cop and let yourself be placed in a tub of water by a guy who lives above a bowling alley?  Yes, suspension of disbelief, but really now), the on-again-off-again Gabriel angel and the under-appreciated Shia LeBoeff, the special effects, the story and the mood went at a decent pace.  Enough to keep you interested in what happens next and the surprising but underwhelming ending.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves is his usual over-serious self, does a great conflicted character as he tries to buy his way into heaven despite the demerit suicide of his younger life.  Long story.<br /><br />My DVD had an alternate ending which was "OK" but still left me wanting.  The deleted scenes were thankfully deleted.  :P<br /><br />I'll probably pick up the Garth Ennis graphic novels first and watch this again.

And playing a daemon-fighting supernatural pariah in the quirky film CONSTANTINE is definitely one of them.  Wow.  The machinations and grandstanding and political posturing between Good and Evil, Heaven and Hell, are every bit as diabolical as what goes on in Washington.  Who would've thunk it?<br /><br />Reeves chain smokes, and mumbles, and sleepwalks through this role as if he wished he were somewhere else, thus making the viewer equally ambivalent.  Tilda Swinton as an androgynous Gabriel is quite the howler.  And Shia LaBeouf, isn't your fifteen minutes just about up?  Yet for everything that really annoyed me about CONSTANTINE, there were some definite pluses.  Djimon Hounsou is always good, and Rachel Weisz plays an easy-on-the-eye victim of the forces of Hades.  But I really liked Peter Stormare as a most lascivious Lucifer; Stormare comes along at the knick of time, and saves CONSTANTINE from falling apart.  Yet I still don't know why I give this movie three stars.  Guess the devil made me do it.<br />--D.

This movie reminded me of his portrayal of previous characters, but mostly he just seemed flat.<br /><br />Despite the casting issues, the movie is visually appealing and the special effects are usually great.  The movie, however, kinda plods along, and I get the feeling that Keanu Reeves would rather be somewhere else.<br /><br />One bonus for me is that The Evil One looks a heck of a lot like my ex-father in law, and that seemed appropriate...but that's just a singular, personal bonus.  Seriously, this is a flawed movie, but it is worth watching.  I expected more, but the visual effects and several scenes compensate the viewer for the slower scenes and general feel of the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A16IXZW2A0NFR6.html">A16IXZW2A0NFR6</a><br/><p>This movie is better than some of the other recent comic book adaptations that bog down our theaters anymore. This is definatly not as crappy as say, Catwoman, Elektra, the lackluster HellBoy, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, The Hulk, Daredevil, Spawn, and is also better than the two Matrix sequels. That being said that really doesn't mean much though because that is a pretty crappy list. Keanu Reeves does well as the title character and the supporting cast is really good as well, but this film is strictly for genre fans. Some good effects make up for the silly theological mish mash.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EAU736LWTDCE.html">A3EAU736LWTDCE</a><br/><p>Someone gave this 5 stars, and called this an "action/horror" film, Phfft ! yea it was just loaded with action (sarcasm)! Blade II is an action horror movie, This to is more of a drama horror movie, and a very slow one at that. Similar to the prophecy or the new exorcist movies. I likes the movies dark atmosphere and strange occurrences, but I can honestly say I would not want to sit through this movie twice. It just dragged on too much. So what your left with is a boring movie with some interesting spots in between. I didn't see a problem with the acting like others had mentioned, however I did see a problem with the lines. Some of the lines they say are not funny, out of place, or just stupid.<br /><br />Verdict<br /><br />Very so/so</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>The trailer for CONSTANTINE made it looking vaguely intriguing: majestic wingspan lifting above Gabriel's head, murky derring-do in the streets of Los Angeles, the presence of Tilda Swinton (always involved - until now - in interesting dramatic films), Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou, and yes, Keanu Reeves.  So what happened?<br /><br />Director Francis Lawrence should stick to his prior experience with making music videos.  After the first few minutes of this tired and monotonous script (deliver in tired monotonous bland monotone by Reeves) you know you should just switch it off.  But then come monsters emerging from the neck of a young girl undergoing exorcism, silly discovery of  a lost spear by a border-crossing Mexican peasant in front of whom all animal life dies, suicides, 'up pops a new monster' episodes etc etc.  The apparent struggle between good and evil forces seems it may have been the impetus for this overblown mess, but others have done it better - many, many, many times ad infinitum.  When will the public's tolerance  (? demand) for this genre be exhausted?

I realize the film may not compare to the comic book, but I am judging the film alone.  As far as I am concerned, the film was one of the sleepers of the year.<br /><br />John Constantine (Keanu Reeves) is an exorcist.  His death from lung cancer is getting closer and closer to his soul and John's guaranteed a "Go to Hell and Do not Pass Go" card when he dies because he attempted suicide when he was very young--and actually died for a short time.<br /><br />Angela (Rachel Weisz) is a cop who can pick a serial killer out of a crowd and shoot them.  She sees things, though she denies it. When her twin sister died of suicide in a mental hospital, She believes some other evil forces were at play because her sister would never have done something like that.<br /><br />Angela learns about Constantine from a priest and goes seeking him for help.  Though a cop, she doesn't know about the daily struggle Constantine goes through to keep the balance between Good-and-Evil and the infestation of half-demons in the world.<br /><br />Demon activity is increasing in LA and it's harder to kick those bad boys back to Hell.  Turns out, a homeless man named Francisco has discovered the Spear of Destiny in a remote Mexican church and is under the Devil's instructions to bring the spear to LA.  If Francisco makes it, Hell's going to win the balance.  As he gets closer to LA, things get even more dangerous.  Constantine and Angela have to team up to fight the forces of evil.<br /><br />This is one rare instance where I liked the book, the movie, and the DVD.  I am going to check out the original works this film came from--because if I enjoyed the pale copy, I think I will seriously love the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FCWRSICTO2AH.html">A1FCWRSICTO2AH</a><br/><p>"Constantine," had cheesy potential, but the cheese is all found in yet another misleading trailer.  The sheer laziness of director Francis Lawrence is amazing.  The editing of the film makes the story nearly incoherent.  And the script?  At one point Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) tells John Constantine (Reeves) that she fears demons have killed her (twin) sister.  Less than five minutes later she tells Constantine that she doesn't believe in the Devil!  Whoa! Doesn't someone, while filming or editing, red flag such inconsistencies?<br /><br />As far as the twin sister goes, that's one red herring among many - like the Spear of Destiny, insane angels, brainless "soldier" demons (what's the difference?), and voodoo magicians.  Much is made here of Weisz's (the "Mummy" lady) performance.  I don't know why.  She simply doesn't have the lines to deliver her from the mess she's in.  Reeves?  "Constantine" is just further evidence that he's an earlier generation's Ben Affleck.  He can't act.  And with "Constantine," and its loads of special effects, he can't be insulated (this time) from that fact.  Interestingly there are two characters that do make an impression.  Tilda Swinton as gender bent angel Gabriel, who has you wondering if Gwyneth Paltrow and David Bowie have morphed into one person, and Peter Stormare's Satan.  Stormare's performance is a particular hoot.  He looks like he wandered in from the set of "Caberet," and he clearly elevates things at a moment when I seemed past caring.  For that alone I'll give "Constantine" two stars.  The rest can go to Hell.</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>A lot of people say Keanu Reeves can't act...a statement which, to me, isn't exactly true...I think he can act, but just that his abilities and range are limited to the point where most of his characters come off as being something someone carved out of wood (deadwood at that)...at the very least, he's still got his good looks to fall back on, and in world dominated by superficialities, that can take you far...disagree?  Then why are so many people interested in a vacuous, untalented void, with absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever, named Paris Hilton?  Perhaps I'm being a bit harsh on Ms. Hilton, but I do so tire of constantly seeing her visage plastered over every stinking media outlet as if she's someone truly worthy of the attention...based on a DC/Vertigo comic book (or graphic novel, if you prefer) called Hellblazer, Constantine (2005) was adapted for the screen by Kevin Brodbin (The Glimmer Man) and directed by Francis Lawrence, whose previous credits are limited to a TV series called `Making the Video', a show that focuses on the actual making of music videos, which, to me, is about one step below those who actually direct music videos, but hey, we all have to start some place...starring in the movie is Keanu `Mr. Woodenhead' Reeves (The Devil's Advocate, The Matrix), along with the very attractive and talented Rachel Weisz (The Mummy, Beautiful Creatures).  Also appearing is Tilda Swinton (Vanilla Sky), whom often gets confused with actress Cate Blanchett, former lead singer from the band Bush Gavin Rossdale, crazy eyeball man Pruitt Taylor Vince (Monster), Max Baker (The Island), Djimon Hounsou (Gladiator), Shia LaBeouf (I, Robot), and Peter Stormare (Fargo, The Big Lebowski) as the embodiment of all that is evil, that's right, I'm talking about Satan...can you dig it?<br /><br />Keanu plays John Constantine, a chain smoking demon hunter, stuck between Heaven and Hell.  Apparently God and the Devil are engaged in a wager, with the souls of all mankind at stake, and since angels and demons can't cross onto our plane of reality, both sides use what's called half breeds to peddle influence, hoping to draw individuals one way or another.  When these half-breeds, specifically the ones from Hell (as you can figure, they're notorious cheaters), break the rules, Constantine deports them back to whence they came, sort of an immigration officer of the damned.  Recently Constantine has been noticing demonic activity above and beyond what he's used to, and it appears to be tied to the suicide death of the sister of a L.A. detective Angela Dodson, played by Weisz, who believes her devoutly Catholic sister who have never risked eternal damnation by doing so, and thereby must have been murdered.  Their paths eventually cross, and Constantine's contacts begin turning up dead (as they get too close to the answer), with signs indicating a possible shift in the fragile balance between good and evil is coming, one that could mean an end to the good times here on Earth.<br /><br />I think this movie is a great example of what happens when one focuses so much on all the little details, and not enough on the casting, expecting any old high profile name to fit the bill and tie it all together...namely in Reeves.  Now I've had the opportunity to read the original story way back when it came out in the Hellblazer comic book, and while I can't recall many of the details, I certainly had a good idea with regards to the character of Constantine, and Reeves just didn't fit the bill, no matter how much they tried to jam his square peg into the round hole.  His character displayed the cynical attitudes and sarcastic, sometimes caustic nature, but it didn't feel like it actually emanated from within Reeves but rather something he was trying to channel from the script.  At least Weisz was there to pick up some of the slack, but there was just too much for her to handle...and so little attention was given to the supporting characters so they were unable to help in that aspect.  Also, I thought the script was somewhat weak, as the dialog added very little life to the characters, with perhaps the exception of Weisz and Stormare, who were both relatively interesting to watch...also, the script and direction seemed to expect a lot of difficult intuitive assumptions from the audience, which often resulted in some confusing aspects that didn't necessarily get cleared up by the end of the story (the Spear of Destiny aspect, in particular).  In terms of the direction, I thought there were some great individual sequences, but when tied together, they didn't work as well as they could have.  The real strength of the film lies in the production design, bringing the special effects to life and merging them in with the real life elements.  They certainly provided a visually interesting and entertaining backdrop to the story, it's just too bad Reeves was chosen to be the focal point of the story as he just couldn't pull it off, or at least that's my opinion, which in the grand scheme of things counts for very little.  I've watch much of the extras in the `making of' featurettes, so I have some idea of the amount of work that went into developing the look and feel of the film, so I wanted to give those folks credit as they worked extremely hard and held up their end very well.  Would a different lead actor have made the difference?  It certainly would have helped a lot, as Keanu's performance only helped to exacerbate the relative weaknesses, specifically in the script, and to a lesser degree, in the direction.  Overall the film was fun and somewhat interesting, but hardly one anyone should rush out to see, especially die-hard fans of the source material, as they'll probably be disappointed the most given such a lack luster, high profile showing of such an interesting and complicated character...is it me, or, for those who read the storyline featured in this film, so much more surprising in the comic than in the film?  I suppose since I knew how it was going to end, the shock value was limited, but it just felt like it came off so much more effective in the comic...<br /><br />I won't bother going over the boat load of extras, as the Amazon website lists them in detail adequately enough, but they did help me appreciate the film a bit more than I did after I saw it...<br /><br />Cookieman108<br /><br />By the way, I did really like those holy brass knuckles...smiting evil was never so cool...</p></br><a href="../users/A30IP5D5DLHRPA.html">A30IP5D5DLHRPA</a><br/><p>I'd like to give this movie a 3.75/5, making it a solid B movie.  Here's why.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />I don't know what it is about the devil that is just scary enough as is, that's just me though.  There were some points that did make me jolt in my seat a little, such as the opening scene when the guy gets "hit" by the car.  Thriller wise the movie is not bad, good usage of camera angles, music and themes but nothing we have not already seen.<br /><br />Believe it or not, but it was quite humorous in some spots.  The humor mostly revolved around Constantine's jerk attitude towards Weisz' character and the devil when he meets him.  There were one or two moments, where I had to applaud his jerk-like behavior... well, one really and you'll know it when you see it.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />The plot was extremely hard to follow at times.  When the devil appeared and took action, I had to ask my friend next to me why in hell he was doing that... turns out I missed it amongst the dialogue that was lost amongst other things.  Other parts, I had no clue what was going on, the screenwriters could've done a much better job at making some things more obvious than others.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves cannot act worth his life, although I saw double the amount of Keanu's facial expressions in Constantine than I saw in The Matrix... namely two.  Weisz is quite the looker and you get a little bit of fanboy service, but it's still somewhat bland.<br /><br />All in all, not bad of a movie but not something I'd want to see again and again over the span of say... my life.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E85KPLPYVW8E.html">A1E85KPLPYVW8E</a><br/><p>***1/2<br />Constantine is a religious supernatural thriller that overall doesn't prove to be too bad of a flick, although it does fall short in a couple of areas in my opinion. I thought the movie had some good performances, an interestingly executed storyline, and some great fx.<br />The movie's first 20 or 30 minutes started out really great and promising, but to me really seemed like it lost its steam about halfway through. There was about a half hour in the middle that really bored the heck out me, and the end picked up somewhat, but didn't do as much for me as the first part of the film did. Leaving the theater I felt satisfied, but kind of unsatisifed at the same time. Make sense?<br />Other than that, Constantine has some strong performances, mainly from Keanu Reeves, a pretty decent plot, and at its best a great visual style accompanied by great special effects with demons, angels and visions of Hell included.<br />Other than falling short in a couple of areas, if you're a fan of Biblical supernatural thrillers about the cataclysm of Earth in the likes of films like Stigmata or End of Days, this is probably worth seeing at least once.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO.html">A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO</a><br/><p>The Feb/2005 released movie Constantine,based on the Hellblazer comic series,comes to DVD in a widescreen edition that is interesting in its premise but falters in its' delivery.<br />The story involves one John Constantine(Keanu Reeves)who has always had the ability to see things people weren't "meant to see".He has done alot of bad things in his life and he has tried to atone for them by working against evil so when he goes his path will lead up and not down.One day he is approached by a police woman named Angela Dodson(Rachel Weisz)to help her regarding her twin sister's untimely death;a plunge off of a roof.At first John balks but relents,soon realizing there is more to the death than meets the eye.John journeys to the other side and back and even assists Angela in doing the same,but they realize too late that her sisters death was basically a ruse to get at Angela.<br />John learns that the archangel Gabriel is actually working with the son of the devil to unleash his progeny onto the world.In order to do this Angela becomes the host for the child and the angel will use the "spear of destiny"(the actual tip of the lance that was used to kill Jesus on the cross)to open her womb and release evil to rule man.Gabriel reckons that only those that survive the time to come will be worthy of God's real salvation.In the meantime John has summoned the Devil himself in a last ditch attempt to foil the Devil's son and the archangel's plans.The Devil indeed stops the birth and renders the angel wingless and earth bound.He returns to John who asks that Angela's sister be let free from Hell in his stead.This is a sacrifice and the Devil has been tricked but in one last effort to keep John from going heavenward,he removes the lung cancer that is killing him and keeps him earth bound to live out his life;hoping one day he will slip up and be his forever.<br />The movie has ALOT of promise throughout with an interesting plot of good versus evil playing out between a man desperate to be redeemed and the evil that would take over the world.The special effects are well done especially in the fight scenes and those involving the glimpses of Hell.However the side plots of Angela and her sister,his side kick Chas Kramer(Shia LaBeouf),his priest friend Father Hennessy(Pruitt Vince)and other characters are just dealt with so heavy handedly,that the plot's narrative flow suffers considerably everytime we go from the action scenes and back to the plot/character advancement.It's a stop/start of a roller coaster ride that detracts from the overall enjoyment of the film.The only three characters I found engaging at all and enhanced the film to any degree,besides Reeve's Constantine,were John's friend Scavenger(Jesse Ramirez),Gabriel(Tilda Swinton) and a beautifully played evil Satan by Peter Stormare.The others were just nondescript window dressing.<br />Technically this film has been transferred well and is presented in its wide screen format.Extras include 18 minutes of so called "additional scenes" which are nothing other than expanded or alternate scenes;with or without commentary.There is also the theatrical trailer.This DVD is actually Disc One of the original two disc release version,just so you know.<br />In conclusion I found Constantine one with a unique and different take on the whole Angels versus Demons,good versus evil chestnut,but overall the plot is a roller coaster of stops and starts which detract from its flow and overall enjoyment;despite the good S/FX.It could/should have been better.I recommend it as a little above average.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>Constatine is a very good movie.

He is called upon to perform exorcisms: the first one of which is a direct steal from "The Exorcism." Constantine finds a child crawling along the walls of her bedroom like a crab while her mother and family say the rosary and pray until Constantine literally beats the demon out of her and onto a mirror, out of which the demon cannot escape: neat trick.<br />Constantine is also a very sick guy and is given only a short time to live because of an advanced stage of lung cancer though he feels no compunction to stop smoking those unfiltered Chinese made cigarettes of his.<br />One of the funky/unusual/cool things about this film is, if you are a Christian or know anything about Christianity or actually religion, the sheer amount of Christian iconography in this film will boggle your mind. There is more stuff on view here than a curio shop in Rome.<br />After about 20 years of watching Keanu Reeves on the screen and scratching my head at the sheer audacity (remember him in "Bram Stoker's Dracula") of his non-performances, I've either gotten used to him or gotten to appreciate him. I'm not sure which. And it started with the Matrix films in which he is not called upon to do much but look well groomed and serious.<br />Rachel Weisz plays a cop who seeks help from Constantine to solve the murder/suicide of her twin sister. Weisz spends a lot of time in a wet tank top which is just fine with me though before undergoing a tub plunging scene she asks Constantine if she has to get naked and he says rather blandly, No. It is at this point that I realiz how sick from the cancer Constantine really is.<br />Peter Stormare plays the Devil (yes, the real thing, not a demon) as a 70's Disco Dude and he is nasty and fun but it's probably Tilda Swinton as the angel-gone-bad Gabriel who steals the movie.<br />"Constantine" is not the best film ever made, but it is fun, the visual effects are first rate and you have Rachel Weisz cavorting in a wet tank top.

The movie presents itself as religious farce, but is simply too disconnected to achieve anything even remotely resembling coherence.  We are led to believe that demons actively battle angels on earth; yet, at the same time we are told that they cannot cross over.  We are provided with disconnected images involving various occult practices, including the use of water as an occult lubricant to facilitate travel to the other world, as well as the use of an old electric chair, formerly used to fry criminals, now used to achieve occult transcendence.  The journeys of the main character to hell are unconvincing, and the plot is virtually nonexistent.  Apparently, the Spear of Longinus, the spear used to pierce the side of Christ as he lay dying on the Cross and believed to give its bearer control over the destiny of the world, makes an appearance; however, the role of this occult relic in the main storyline seems contrived.  The movie claims to be based on Catholic theology, but entirely neglects the role of Purgatory in the process of Salvation.  Lucifer also makes an appearance, but his bare-footed character is not at all how I would imagine the Prince of Darkness.  God does not appear in this movie!  As others have noted, about the only thing redeeming this movie at all is the performance of Rachel Weisz.  She does a great job, but unfortunately the rest of this movie is so much hodge-podge glued together that it fails to deliver.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Constantine" is great!

Receiving almost universal bad reviews and word of mouth, the film would seem to be a surefire bomb.<br /><br />Perhaps because my expectation were so low, I actually thought "Constantine" was a good choice for a bargain matinee.<br /><br />John Constantine (Reeves) is working overtime. Attempting to earn a ticket into Heaven, he travels throughout Los Angeles waging a one man battle against Hell's demons. The demons are breaking through to the other side, upsetting the balance agreed upon by God and Lucifer. Angela (Weisz) runs into Constantine as they are both seeking guidance. Constantine is trying to convince the angel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton), that he deserves to go to Heaven. She somewhat patiently explains that he can't get in because he once committed suicide. Angela, a detective, is seeking the guidance of a priest over her twin sister's suicide at a Catholic hospital. Soon, she convinces Constantine to help her figure things out as he wages his battle with the devil.<br /><br />"Constantine" has a terrific, and more importantly, consistent look. Every scene is permeated with brown tones which give it the feel of old drawings or dusty, old books from a library. This theme is carried throughout to ensure that the look of the film stays consistent. As Constantine and his driver, Chas (Shia LaBeouf, trying to channel the spirit of comic sidekicks of yesteryear) travel from one location to the next, from day to night, the film keeps us rooted in it's visual place. When the film moves the action indoors, most of the interiors are cramped and filled with millions of little objects, displaying an attention to detail that is not often shown in film today.<br /><br />The story of "Constantine" is very complex and multifaceted. Yes, his main journey is to stop Hell from breaking through, but there are a lot of facets to the story that you might not expect. Both Constantine and Angela are deeply religious, which is why they are devoting so much effort to this journey. Along the way, we learn various things about each of them, which gives them a depth you also might not expect.<br /><br />The performances from the supporting cast are more interesting. Pruitt Taylor Vince plays an alcoholic priest, Constantine's minder, so to speak. If a demon is trying to break through, the priest knows about it, and sends Constantine in to clean up the mess. Tilda Swinton plays the angel Gabriel. Her character plays an interesting role in the overall picture. Gavin Rossdale (lead singer of the band Bush), plays Balthazar, Constantine's main menace in the real world. His every moment is spent trying to make sure that Constantine does not win the battle or entry into Heaven. Peter Stormare plays Satan. Slightly effeminate, his role is very interesting. He seems attracted to Constantine, despite the fact that he has to do everything he can to stop him. Keanu Reeves and Rachel Weisz? Well, there's zero chemistry between them, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Recently, I saw Keanu Reeves interviewed on a BBC America special before the 2005 BAFTA Awards. The poor interviewer! Most of the stars were very acomodating, but not Keanu. He would barely stop. As he tried to sweep past the guy, he was asked "How does this awards show compare to that of the Oscars?" Keanu's response: "It is what it is." Well, Keanu's performance is what it always is. Keanu is always better when he doesn't have to speak a lot of lines ("Speed", "The Matrix"). If he doesn't have to open his mouth, we can believe most of what we are supposed to believe. If he has to act, or emote, than we run into trouble.<br /><br />My other big complaint is that I felt the character of Satan, as played by Peter Stormare, should have been more intelligent. He was interesting, but it seems fairly easy for Constantine to beat him. I don't know, maybe it's just me, but if a human being is going to battle against the devil, it seems like it should be a fight hard won.</p></br><a href="../users/A23QOAXJSWIBS6.html">A23QOAXJSWIBS6</a><br/><p>There was a lot to like in "Constantine."  I'll leave aside the jumbled theology and event-driven plot.  My feeling is the film was mis-cast from the beginning with Keanu Reeves in a suit.  Can we all say "NEO!" in unison?<br /><br />The special effects were great, but nothing ground-breaking.  The story-line was good, but not revolutionary.  I have not read the graphic-novel, but I have been told that there were significant changes to characters on the whole.<br /><br />It is not a terrible film, but I'm convinced that it would have been a substantially better film if it had been Jude Law or Chris O'Donnell in that suit instead of Keanu.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CIH3P8UDB6GR.html">A3CIH3P8UDB6GR</a><br/><p>Overall, this is a good movie.

It's obvious that Keanu Reeves needed a commercial hit again since the completion of The Matrix series, but he's not right for this gig. He's too good looking in this movie, and if he had done some serious transformation like Christian Bale(The Machinist), he probably would be more convincing. Oh well, he's definitely got 5 times more fans and bankability than Bale, even if he's a less sophisticated actor.<br /><br />This film didn't strike me as horror experience, it's more of a religion/spiritual thriller. In the beginning, we get to see Reeves perform an exorcism on a girl who was posessed by a demon that escaped Hell, and it was his "job" to capture and deport it back to The Other Dimension. It was an impressive visual, even if the girl was not Linda Blair. From that moment on, the film headed on a multi-plot direction that was kind of confusing. As for the structure of Hell and how someone will be rejected by Heaven(also known as The Other Side), it's not very acurate. Reeve's character is someone who attempted suicide at an early age, because he couldn't take it anymore dued to his overwhelming ability(gift) to see through other dimensions. He came back, and he's not eligible to go to Heaven, but he intended to regain credibility by fighting against Hell. During his journey, he encounters Rachel Weisz(playing a dual role of twins), whose sister committed suicide and she was trying to unsolve her mysterious death, since she knew that she didn't deliberately killed herself. Reeves was the only person to assist her to dig into the surface of things. Along the way, there are other characters they come across, including Reeves' sidekick(a psychic). A mysterious Archangel played by the underused Tilda Swinton who managed to steal scenes with every minute of the screen time. A Witch Doctor who had the access to both Heaven and Hell played by the very intense  Djimon Hounsou, he was so good that Keanu Reeves looked like a supporting role when they are in a scene together. Throughout the rest of this movie, Reeves and Weisz were attacked by demons and and he had to decent to Hell to investigate things, but we don't really get to know who the real mastermind of the plot to take ove the world is until the very end.<br /><br />The story was kind of weak, but it's got some good visuals consistently. Keanu Reeves didn't get to do very much action scenes like he did in The Matrix. I was very surprised that they could get Tilda Swinton to be in this movie, but it's too bad that she didn't even have more than 10 minutes of screentime.</p></br><a href="../users/AXOS8IWBXNZGT.html">AXOS8IWBXNZGT</a><br/><p>I've developed a soft spot over the last few years, and have dragged myself out to see all sorts of "comic book movies": Spiderman, Hulk, Daredevil, X-Men...and now Constantine. It's not that I'm a big Keanu fan (though I do think that folks were undeservably harsh on him in the Matrix sequels), or a Rachel Weisz fan (she's cute and all, but I've not seen her in much outside of this movie and the Mummy to judge her talent by), but I was interested in seeing a less "mainstream" comic book movie, shall we say? It's a comic book movie without the (anti)hero being a superhero.<br /><br />So, how was it? The pace was slow and sedate, for the most part, punctuated with scary/horror bits that keep things moving. It's almost as if I should be calling this a horror/drama. I'm not going to get into a discussion of the plot, so there won't be any spoilers here...let's just say that the premise is geared very much towards Catholics, more than anything else...no discussion of other religions, and all the Catholic religious trappings are on full display. The special effects are on the same level as the Mummy. Keanu gets to display a fuller range of human emotions than he did in the Matrix, and Rachel turns in a reasonable performance. Everyone else involved is turning in smaller, supporting role performances. Gavin Rossdale of the band Bush plays Balthazar, a demon type. The cinematography was OK, and the sound quality was good, though they did not use surround sound to its full potential I thought.<br /><br />Would I recommend it? Perhaps for rental. It's not that special....the pacing is just a little too slow in spots. It is an R-rated movie, so don't plan on seeing it on an airplane unless you're in business or first class on an intercontinental flight.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>Yet another comic book movie graces the big screen in the adaptation of DC Comics's "Constantine".  John Constantine (Reeves) is cursed with the ability to see angels and demons in the world around us.  And they are everywhere.  As a child, he tried to kill himself rather than deal with what he saw.  He was unsuccessful, and now he is trying to atone for his suicide and win God's favor so that he may enter heaven upon his death.  Constantine does not really have faith though, and he finds himself tormented to one degree or another by the angel Gabriel (Swinton) and the demon Balthazar (Rossdale).  Oh yeah, and he has terminal lung cancer.  If that is not enough of a downer, Satan's son is trying to enter the "real world" and mess everything up.  With the help of Angela Dodson (Weisz), a Los Angeles cop, he just might be able to stop him, but it will not be easy.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves is still in "Matrix" mode, and Constantine is not too different from Neo, the character he played three times.  Unfortunately, that character is growing tiresome.  Reeves definately needs a more upbeat movie to work on next.  Swinton does a good job as the androgenyous angel Gabriel, helping and tormenting poor Constantine at the same time.  The real scene stealer is Peter Stormare as Satan himself.  Played with creepy glee, one wishes that he had more screen time.  "Constantine" also does not feel like it is playing fair at times, bending the rules that it has set up for the supernatural forces.  My suggestion is to wait for the DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>How would you feel if the rest of your future career in Hollywood was to be bent on the outcome of one film? You might have somewhat of a clue as to what Keanu Reeves might be feeling with his new action-thriller Constantine right now. Though he rose to superstardom with the lead role in the cult-classic film The Matrix in 1999, his other films since then have not been such sensational blockbusters, let alone cult classics. And even the two sequels to the famous science-fiction thriller were deemed disappointments, the last entry in the franchise not even garnering close to the box office receipts of the original years earlier, and that was before inflation. Should this chalk up another disappointment for `Neo', this could spell the end to his career, at least as far as action-thrillers go.<br /><br />The story centers on a man exorcising half-bred demons from the world in order to garner redemption from God to gain entry into Heaven. As a young man, John Constantine came to see things that no living human should ever be forced to see, half-bred demons and angels disguised as average earthly citizens influencing the actions and decisions of various human beings as part of a vast bet enraging between God and the Devil for the souls of all mankind. Sadly his parents only made the terrifying situation even worse for him when they had him admitted to a mental institution where he was given shock therapy and other sorts of cruel `treatments' in order to cure him of his disease. Ultimately John, not wanting to live with his `curse' any longer, commits suicide but is brought back to life against his will. In spite of the fact that he now has a new lease on life, John knows full well that no matter how he goes out he is going to end up in Hell for throwing away God's greatest gift to humanity, life itself, unless he finds some way to redeem himself and regain entry into Heaven. He decides to use his `gift' from God to engage half-bred demons and send them back to Hell where they belong, but because he does this only in his own self-interest, God has yet to grant him his `retirement' and he is quickly running out of time. Thanks to his avid chain-smoking habits since he was fifteen years old, his lungs are riddled with cancer and every day he coughs up blood, a reminder then his time is running out fast. Along comes Angela Dodson, a police detective investigating the supposed suicide of her twin sister, Isabel, at a mental institution where she had been committed, but she suspects that there might be something else behind her mysterious death. Seeking help from the loner Constantine, Angela becomes embroiled in a conflict as ancient as time itself, a war waged between Good and Evil for ultimate control of the fate of mankind.<br /><br />The story for Constantine is meant merely as a piece of pure entertainment, in the footsteps of The Da Vinci Code, and should not be taken for theological gospel by any sense of the word. But the film does have its fair share of sensitive, contemplative issues such as suicide, salvation, damnation, Heaven, Hell, God, Satan, Good and Evil which are all addressed quite profoundly in the script, though not at the level of which influence toward a particular side is projected onto its audience.  Constantine confidently acts as a film in which the ideas are placed in the back of your mind but are given enough space in which you are allowed to still make your own decisions on the issue. Though in the end this should be nothing more then a piece of worthy escapism with no serious religious substance to its storyline other then the basic principle assumptions of characters and items mentioned in its run, the feature's more significant moments are worth contemplating, be it on a much higher level of thinking.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves is perfectly cast as John Constantine, one of the most unlikable comic-book superheroes you are ever going to come across, either on paper or on the silver screen. Constantine is coarse, cynical, sulky, standoffish, a chain-smoker, and reckless but, then again, how would you be if you knew that you were dying and ultimately going to end up to the place you had sent hundred of half-bred demons back down to, Hell. This is a picture of a man who has luck working against him in every conceivable way possible. He has always been alone in the world, not purely out of necessity but possibly for the fact that in the end he knows that this is going to be the path he alone must walk, but still being human he desires companionship. Rachel Weisz in a way pulls double-duty in the role of Angela Dodson, the police detective investigating the death of her twin sister, not surprisingly also played by Weisz, who she claims was not suicidal, though to be quite honest there is not much to the role of the dead twin who, conventionally, acts as a dead person should - limp and lifeless. Weisz works well in the role of a woman who is seriously conflicted, with both guilt and distress, over the death of her sister and the prospects of allowing to have had her committed to a mental institution for claiming to have witnessed images of half-bred angels and demons which she could also see but lied about in order to escape the same fate of incarceration. She desperately desires to make it up to her estranged twin sister but how does one save their sibling from an eternity of damnation in the fiery pits of Hell? Shia LaBeouf, who is coming along quite nicely as an effective performer in Hollywood, brings some much needed lighthearted moments to the rather bleak presentation in the role of Chas Chandler, Constantine's demon-slayer in training. Yes, Chandler's exit near the finale does seem to short change the audience who had built up so much hope and aspiration for this Constantine-in-training but, as is abundantly clear in the real world, life is not always as fair as we think it should be with terrible events befalling the righteous all too suddenly. It acts as a reminder of the cruel justice of life.<br /><br />It was actually quite clever, at least in terms of theological thinking, the way in which Tilda Swinton's take on the role of the Archangel Gabriel was presented, both in her presentation onscreen and in the way the character's actions are integrated into various parts of the script. The filmmakers, clearly not wanting to take sides on the debate of whether God or Heaven in general is a patriarchal or matriarchal in nature, give Gabriel a feminine-like quality, which is not all that uncommon with romanticized angels, while at the same time dressing him/her up in masculine business suits. It was also quite profound in the way Gabriel is dealt with near the end of the film. Though he/she has nothing but good intentions for releasing the son of Satan in order to bring about eternal salvation for mankind, one can never forget that the road to Hell is paved with good intentions. Peter Stormare, best known for his appearance in such Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer productions as Bad Boys II and Armageddon, enacts Satan just as you might picture him if he were based in the realm of the real world, which is that of the ultimate incarnation of evil but with a twisted comical sense of humor. The scene in which John Constantine calls upon Satan to prevent the end of the world is an intriguing piece of dialogue, probably having more to do with the way Stormare presents the character then anything else. Constantine, with every last ounce of strength he has in him, plays the fallen angel to the best of his weakness, his jealousy of the Lord and Heaven, to prevent Gabriel from unleashing his son, delivering mankind into eternal salvation and thereby losing the bet.<br /><br />Overall, Constantine will sadly leave those in search of arcane theological dissipation within the same context as The Passion of the Christ only relatively despondent but in part to its sophisticated blurring of the lines between theistic principles and Da Vinci Code embellishment to entertain even the least spiritual amongst us. In the long there are honestly only a scant few glitches located within the action-thriller that ultimately prevent it from achieving a higher status then it conveys to its audience but noticeable enough to be noted here. First off, how in God's name (no pun intended) did the `Spear of Destiny' wind up in Mexico City draped in a Nazi flag? In these kinds of situations it is perhaps better not to ask such detailed inquiries; it only ruins the effect, as The Da Vinci Code can attest to. Secondly, there were particular sequences and/or effects that failed to register any sense of logic or consistency to their inclusion and therefore would have been better off left on the cutting room floor. Take for example the scene in which Constantine upon leaving the gas station is attacked by a man, or whatever he was, made up entirely of insects and vermin. What was the exact point of this scene? And lastly, the lack of consonance within the rules of `the balance' as well as the theological elements on which the film's script bases itself upon, though not entirely damaging, does the hinder the audience's deep-seeded spiritual involvement in the premise as some would have wanted. On the other hand though, the special effects are positively sensational, especially concerning the filmmakers' interpretation of both Hell and Heaven as dark and light versions of our lives on Earth. Seriously, do not go into this film believing that you are about to receive the holy word of God himself or be shown down the path of true righteousness because that is not Constantine's purpose. It is meant as a little piece of escapism, of which it performs remarkably well as. There are some real issues dealt within this film's script but if you are truly searching for answers, or at least your investigative opinion on these thoughts, please visit church officials, such as the ones at your local parish, and discuss them in detail there without relying too heavily on this film for anything more then entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/AHABFECTNE15I.html">AHABFECTNE15I</a><br/><p>Version: U.S.A / Region A, B, C<br />Format: Blu-ray<br />Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br />VC-1 BD-50 / Advanced Profile 3<br />Running time: 2:00:47<br />Movie size: 21,23 GB<br />Disc size: 28,85 GB<br />Average video bit rate: 11.88 Mbps<br /><br />Dolby TrueHD Audio  English  1404 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 16-bit / 1404kbps (AC3 Core: 5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbps)<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  640 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  French  640 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  French  640 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  German  640 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  Italian  640 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  Japanese  640 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  Spanish  640 kbps  5.1 / 48kHz / 640kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  192 kbps  2.0 / 48kHz / 192kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  English  192 kbps  2.0 / 48kHz / 192kbps<br />Dolby Digital Audio  Spanish  192 kbps  2.0 / 48kHz / 192kbps<br />Dolby Digital Plus Audio  English  192 kbps  2.0 / 48kHz / 192kbps<br /><br />Subtitles: English SDH / Danish / Dutch / Finnish / French / German / Italian / Japanese / Norwegian / Portuguese / Spanish / Swedish<br /><br />Number of chapters: 34<br /><br />***************************************************************<br /><br />Format: HD DVD<br />VC-1 / HD-30<br />Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br />Running time: 2:00:40<br />Movie size: 16,42 GB<br />Disc size: 23,57 GB<br />Average video bit rate: 13.15 Mbps</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>After hearing this was the best Keanu movie I decided to go see this movie to see what I thought.

Everyone calls him stupid and I can not disagree more. I think Keanu is actually a dark character or at least plays it well in this film. I don't know why there is so much hostility towards this man but I am writing this review to defend him and his acting. I actually think he acted pretty well in this movie, especially in the beginning of the movie where he takes the demon out of a poor girl. Keanu Reeves has good acting skills and actually played out this movie well. This movie's plot is what drew me to this film because it sounded interesting, even though I am not too religious and this movie is heavily drenched in religion. Yet it was played out good nonetheless. I was drawn to see what would happen at the end and it was not predictable. I like the alternative ending as well on the deleted scenes but definitely the first ending is better.<br /><br />Don't take what a lot of these reviewers said so personally, fellow reader. Keanu Reeves is not as bad as they make him sound. He is actually pretty good in this movie and made this film quite interesting. Honestly if there was a young exorcist I would imagine him to look a lot like Keanu, dark hair and all. The other actors aren't too bad either, I thought the person who played Gabriel was very interesting. I give this movie a solid four stars. Like the movie Stigmata was for me, it was good as a thriller, but too heavily religious for me to be five star. Still good though, and worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>I thought Constantine was the guy in a rock band who tried out for American Idol what a rip off.

Keanu Reeves best sence the Matrix.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NBOL825B93OM.html">A2NBOL825B93OM</a><br/><p>For starters, I want to say that I have never read Hellblazer's comic books - although I should have, since John Constantine is a product of Alan Moore's mind - so I'm not biased to criticize this movie based on the comic book series. This review is about the movie, and only the movie.<br /><br />I think Keanu Reeves is one of the worst mainstream Holywood actors - "The devil's advocate" is there to prove it - but after viewing the trailler of "Constantine" I intended to watch the movie, because battles between Heaven and Hell, CGI demons and, most of all, Rachel Weisz - I'll watch anything when she `s cast - have always attracted my attention.<br /><br />The trailler is great - maybe because Keanu Reeves' only lines are the whispering "This is Constantine... John Constantine..." - but the movie is a only a pale shadow of what's shown in the teaser. OK, there are some good visuals, the images of Hell are interesting and Miss Weisz is as beautiful as ever, and a competent actress also, carrying the weight of this flop in her back alone. But the good things stop there. The script is pathetic. There's no story. There's no final confrontation. Worst of all, there's no battle between Heaven and Hell, or Good and Evil. Character development is nill. We only know that Constantine... John Constantine has been to Hell and came back, and he's trying to beat the world record of most cigarretes smoked in a movie (record presently shared by William Hurt and Mel Gibson). That Chas character was pitiful, an expendable sidekick used to make the audience go mad at the Devil's son's harsh intentions. I don't remember any other characters. Oh, yes, the drunk priest and the voodoo club owner. And Tilda Swinton as the archangel Gabriel. Nevermind. Acting is completely lame - with the exception of Rachel Weisz. Keanu Reeves does the best that he can do, which is close to nothing. The Neo thing, I guess. The worst of all is Peter Stormare portraying the Devil like a circus buffoon. Even the visual effects are bad. Two ro three scenes at most, and they're all displayed in the trailler.<br /><br />Anyway, this movie is not good. This is no way to spend a hundred million dollars. I can understand Hallblazer's fans anger towards this movie. There's very little to be praised in "Constantine". I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />Grade 3.5/10</p></br><a href="../users/A1EMDSTJDUE6B0.html">A1EMDSTJDUE6B0</a><br/><p>This is too much like "The Matrix". For the first half hour, it was making me mad. All the same effects and even in same locations. Although some of the good/evil approaches were actually thought provoking, it wasn't really new. Not bad for a filler, but not a main event.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>When I saw that "Constantine" was coming to the big screen I wasn't all that excited at first.  Mainly because I had never read the comic book 'Hellblazer', that inspired the film.  Then I saw the preview and it looked like a very entertaining sci-fi/religious thrill ride in the vein of 'The Prophecy' series, "End of Days", and "Hellboy", plus Keanu looked pretty cool in one of his first post-'Matrix' action films.<br /><br />"Constantine" is based on the popular Vertigo/DC Comic 'Hellblazer', which follows the demon hunting exploits of its hero John Constantine (Keanu Reeves).  Constantine is a chain smoking, wise-cracking, selfish demon hunter, whose primary goal in life is to send as many of Hell's minions back to where they belong and hopefully work his way into Heaven.  During his quest he is aided by Chaz (Shia Lebouf), Papa Midnight (Djimon Hounsou), and a seemingly duplictious angel named Gabriel (Tilda Swinton).  When a cop (Rachel Weisz) discovers her twin sister has seemingly committed suicide, she enlists the aide of Constantine in discovering what exactly happened to her God-fearing sister to cause her to end her life.  This mystery only deepens as Constantine discovers that demons are attempting to crossover into Earth's realm, and this cop, when coupled with the mythic Spear of Destiny, is the key.<br /><br />With terrific special effects, most notably the imaginative interpretation of Hell as being an alternate reality, so that it appears to be a constantly buring Los Angeles.  Pitch-perfect performances by the cast, that bring depth and reality to their comic book counterparts, and fast-paced editing and directing from first time movie director Francis Lawrence, "Constantine" is sci-fi/religious thriller that is guaranteed to keep you entertained.<br /><br />Though, not entirely faithful to the comic book according to fan boys and the movies own making of featurette admits this, the film is an enjoyable comic book adaptation.  The theology for the movie is steeped primarily in Catholicism, even then it's not an accurate depiction of the faith, definitely not a movie to base your religious beliefs on, but then again it never aspired for that purpose.  As I said earlier, it appeared this one would be another one of the great sci-fi/religious thrillers, and I was right.  If you enjoyed 'The Prophecy' series, "Hellboy", 'The Omen' franchise, or "End of Days", then this movie is for you.<br /><br />With the great success of "Constantine" hopefully Warner Brothers will realize the potential in this film for a franchise, especially since Keanu Reeves, Rachel Weisz, and Djimon Hounsou have all expressed interest in returning, and treat audiences to more demon hunting with "Constantine 2".<br /><br />"Constantine" is rated R for violence and language.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PASRZ81DY9C.html">A1PASRZ81DY9C</a><br/><p>Viewed: 6/06<br />Rate: 3<br /><br />6/06: Moving well after the first hour, Constantine crumbled mercilessly itself apart because the story had gotten too weird and contrived for me to take. Of course, Constantine had the film noir going on, but it's too pretentious in trying to be a pastiche in that genre. It would be nice to have a good movie that will literally focus on the meat of the story and try to develop that while having the quality of the acting, but it turns out that Constantine is an excuse, as the rest of my films released after the year 2000, to display very boring and overblown computer graphics. Come on, I want a story, not an abuse on my eyes. `3' was given for trying decently enough to get the story going, but lost points for being a waste of time. I feel like I am watching a rehash of The Matrix in The Exorcist disguise. Any time of the day, I would watch The Exorcist or The Omen over Constantine. Why? Because it was about the story. Because it focused on the acting. Because there were no computer graphics. Because it is enjoyable and easy to follow. Constantine? Forget it. The secret is to simplify it. Less is more.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>Keanu Reeves clashes with Satan...again.<br /><br />Adapted from the comic-book Hellblazer (but renamed to avoid confusion with Hellboy and Hellraiser), John Constantine first appeared in an issue of Swamp Thing and soon got his own series. The character is from Liverpool but the movie version transplants him to LA (it's a more photogenic environment, let's be honest). He's supposed to be a psychic, occult detective but it's never explicitly mentioned what he is in the movie, which is the first instance of confusion the viewer will encounter.<br /><br />Constantine ends up involved in a plot with LAPD detective Angela Dodson and her dead twin sister (both played by the lovely Rachel Weisz) which leads to confrontations with various angels and demons. So much happens in this film, but hardly any of it is explained. Don't get me wrong, I hate endless exposition, but Francis Lawrence tries to deliver virtually ALL of it with visual storytelling and it just doesn't work. There are so many random, unintelligible and moments that will alienate many viewers render the bulk of the film completely incomprehensible.<br /><br />Francis Lawrence fills the movie with lots of symmetrical photography and beautifully eloquent shots that act as a muted counterpoint to the fake CGI, and the sound design is thankfully down-played. In the hands of a less-talented director (Brett Ratner, Len Wiseman) this film would have been loud and unsightly with lots of stutter-cuts and 'impossible camera' shots. I'm glad that Lawrence does not use this approach for his feature films.<br /><br />It all looks very pretty, but it'll last in your memory about 5 seconds after the credits roll (there's a scene after the credits too).<br /><br />The Blu Ray looks and sounds great in 2.42:1 1080p and Dolby TrueHD. There are plenty of extras.</p></br><a href="../users/AMG2LF8MLUDN1.html">AMG2LF8MLUDN1</a><br/><p>Constantine.  A sort of modified Neo character but not nearly as likeable.  This film is a silly "spiritual" kind of film with some incorrect bible facts thrown in.  Reeves gives his usual deadpan performance which worked for him in the Matrix films but certainly does not work here.  His character is a chain smoker who is dying of lung cancer but continues to chain smoke because he's going to hell.  There's a great advertisement for cigarettes!  Actually it gets quite annoying after awhile.<br /><br />Unfortunately, many folks who watch these kind of films get their so called "Sunday school education" from them.  They walk away thinking that they've learned something.  If they'd just read the bible they would see that most of the messages they get from these films are so wrong.<br /><br />This film was so uninteresting that I can't even bring myself to recount the story for you.  It's that boring.  The oddest thing about this movie may be the casting of Reeves himself.  Still riding high from his success with the Matrix trilogy, I guess the casting agents thought that his name would bring in the box office bucks.  He maybe the strangest actor in history.  He's not a great actor, but people keep giving him work.  I like him myself but I'm not sure why yet.  Somebody get my therapist on the phone quick!!!  He's attractive, yes, but his only real claim to fame is that he only has one character in him.  That character is Keanu Reeves.  Nobody plays him better.  He's been called the most boring actor in the world.  Still, people like him.  They like to see him on the screen.  I don't know if this film will boost his career any higher but it just might.  That's the way the cookie crumbles in Hollyweird!  Go figure.<br /><br />Go watch The Matrix.  Nothing special to see here.</p></br><a href="../users/A11XKY4EIU2KNR.html">A11XKY4EIU2KNR</a><br/><p>You know Keanu was OK when he was a kid with his 'Bill and Ted' stuff, but starting with Speed, I thought of him as nothing much more than a buffoon. I just find him annoying.<br /><br />Well this flick is about angels and devils and how neither can enter our world but can only 'whisper in our ears'. Well Keanu attempted suicide as a boy, went to hell for two minutes and then came back to life. Now supposedly he's doomed to hell because suicide is a cardinal sin in the Catholic Church. So no matter what he does in his life he's going to hell. You will hear this no less than 20 times in the movie. So he's trying to buy his way into heaven by sending demons back to hell through exorcisms.<br /><br />Well we get a lot of explanations like how the Bible in hell tells a different story in Revelations. You got Satan's son being born, Gabriel trying to kill it, demons made of flies and snakes, and a voodoo witch doctor bar owner who stays neutral.<br /><br />If I may put forth a little bit of opinion. The dude who played Satan was the worst movie Satan I've ever seen. An old bald man is bad enough, but why was he dressed in a white? Like a heavenly white? I wasn't expecting horns, a pitchfork, and a red suit, but this is supposed to be Satan for crying out loud. With the money they spent on special effects, they could have at least delivered a frightening Satan. His demons were fifty times scarier than the Prince of Darkness himself.<br /><br />Well in a nutshell, Keanu still can't act and special effects carried the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PMQH87R1H3QU.html">A2PMQH87R1H3QU</a><br/><p>I cant believe these movies on double disk put all the loaded stuffs on disk ,And hard work, which most people don't care, then they put 5.1 audio sound crap to it, such as awful...please people if u do all the goodies an all on DVDS at least put the DTS sound to it for most people like me have surround sound these days at home..Such movies like this kind of gender u should have a blast high-end sound to it to really enjoy the movie such as DTS ...for this important matter I give 2 starts and I am not going to buy this DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>It's one of the worst movies starting Keanu Reeves. The plot is ridiculous. The special effects are below par. There's no suspense nor horror here.</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>Why can't I give this movie less than one star?!  This movie does not deserve one star.  It deserves as little praise as it can get.  This is probably the dumbest movie that I have seen in a long time... and I have been watching Mystery Science Theater 3000 lately as well, which is really saying something about the quality of this movie.<br />The "story" follows John Constantine (Keanu Reeves), a man who is sort of a paranormal investigator/exorcist.  In a way, he is like Blade, except there aren't any vampires.  We later learn that he does this because he is trying to buy his way into heaven after he committed suicide and was physically dead for about 2 minutes (Earth time).  He soon meets Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz), a cop whose sister Isabel (also Weisz) has just committed suicide herself, which didn't fit with her character at all.  She seeks Constantine's help, and they begin to realize that the forces of the Devil are gearing up to try to infest our world.<br />Also, there is this thing called the Spear of Destiny (although it's more of a dagger) which so important that the movie starts out with a textual description of it, and then goes to a shot of some guy in Mexico finding it (although they never explain how this dagger, which has been missing since Nazi Germany fell, got all the way to Mexico wrapped in a Nazi flag).  Then, we never really see it again until the end of the movie, with one brief little appearance in the middle.<br />The cast is awful.  [...] I didn't mind Keanu Reeves'erformance in The Matrix (the first one), but then again, the movie wasn't dependent on a good performance; it could survive without a strong lead.  This movie needed a competant leading actor to carry it because the story sure wasn't going to.  Rachel Weisz, who I usually see as a talented actress seemed to be going through the motions in this movie, which I guess is understandable.  But I would have to say that one of the worst things about the cast is that Shia LaBeouf plays the EXACT SAME CHARACTER HE PLAYED IN I, ROBOT!  He had the same role (stupid, underappreciated sidekick who wants to be the hero), same mannerisms, and same path (except for the characters' final fates).  The rest of the cast was pretty much like Weisz, just kind of going through the motions.<br />Effects: terrible sound effects (one of the demons sounded a lot like Gollum from the Lord of the Rings movies) and really [bad] CGI; nothing looked remotely real or believable.  Not that the movie itself was much better in the field of believability.  Many things were left unanswered or unaddressed, and even some things avoided explanation because the characters already knew what certain things meant.  The Angela Dodson character didn't need to be told what the Spear of Destiny was because she learned about it in Catholic school (I was with some friends who attended Catholic school for years, and none of them had ever heard the term Spear of Destiny).  I have to admit that I saw this at an advance screening (so it was free), and the projectionist screwed up while changing a reel, so we missed about 10 seconds of dialogue.  Right when it came back up, Dodson said something like, "But I guess you already knew that".  I don't know, maybe if we had heard those lost 10 seconds, the movie would be better, but it is very unlikely.<br />Strangely, I found myself laughing a lot at this movie, even though it is definitely not a comedy.  The only thing that was actually supposed to be funny, though, was probably the best thing in the movie.  Oh, but I did have a great time making fun of this movie.  Some other titles that I considered were "A Mistake of Biblical Proportions" or "Holy (expletive deleted)!".<br />[...]</p></br><a href="../users/A1R2ONSLAI3M2X.html">A1R2ONSLAI3M2X</a><br/><p>My goodness.

And no-no-no, you can't commit suicide, because if you do, you automatically go to Hell. Chain smoking is another sure method.

And the sacrifice is supposed to save the world. Not by redeeming the sins of human beings. But by preventing the birth of Lucifer's son and the total take-over of the world by him. The strangest element is that everything is purely haphazard. There is no plan, no real perspective known and controlled by anyone, especially not God, and least of all Lucifer. It is pure opportunism on their sides and human beings are always taken in-between these two famously inconsequent and irresponsible characters and they have to accept, follow and suffer what the other two in their big conflict don't even know they produce. Even Archangel Gabriel is totally spaced out and corrugated and Lucifer will punish him by burning his wings and making him human and sensitive to suffering. Let's hope for eternity. The special effects are from time to time agreeable and pleasant but never really outstanding. The story is messy and obscure and the spear that had been used by a Roman soldier to pierce Jesus' side on the cross and had disappeared for some time reappears by pure luck somewhere in Mexico of all places. Na?ve. And we don't know at all what's the use of it and what it brings to the story. The second coming of Lucifer's son is a failure. The second coming of some Jesus, new or old, is also a failure since Lucifer has to resuscitate him for him not to go to Hell for eternity. And they repeat as often as possible that He has a plan for anyone of us. In fact He and They have nothing for none of us. We are lost in a messy haphazard conflict between a truant God and a totally disorganized Lucifer. That's what divine providence amounts to: nothing at all.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/A238M34Z3X2IBD.html">A238M34Z3X2IBD</a><br/><p>CONSTANTINE should not work, being so divorced from its original format - the VERTIGO comic HELLBALZER, and removed so completely from the dark wit, stark horror and charm found in the original John Constantine - who is the complete opposite of a Hollywood star like Keanu Reeves.<br /><br />Constantine in HELLBALZER is not pretty, not sharp.  He's shapelss, lacking grace, always on the edge - but knowing where he stands, fixed between the light and the dark and the only thing keeping him in balance are his instincts, double deals and knack for killing all the right people.  And while some of this is carried over from comic to the screen - little of it makes a dent on Reeves performance (and if you want to see a near dead on perfomance of what Constantine is really like - check out James Marsters perfomance as SPIKE on both BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and ANGEL).  We all know the jokes about Reeves being wooden - and while it's true that you could almost pick up a splinter watching his performance here, it actually almost works.  But both Reeves, and the film itself, are actually hostages to style - and it's here that CONSTANTINE shines.<br /><br />Sterile, bleak and clean are three words you'll find yourself repeating as you watch the film.  All the edges are sharp, all the light is harsh and the darkness is brutal.  Colors are muted and often reduced to simple blacks and whites (and shades in between).  But the stand out is Hell itself.  While meant to be be horrific, the work done here is excellent (the movie gets a much needed surge in power and depth here), and you'll find yourself actually being drawn into the setting and want to know more.  It amounts in the end to nothing more than a big tease (more questions than answers), but it does really help to keep you watching the film all the way through to the credits.<br /><br />The story keeps to the straight and narrow.  Reeves is the star, and he's surrounded mostly by pale ghosts from the comic.  We get some names, we get some idea of their backgrounds and powers, but little is done with them.  They're there to get him from one place to another, answer a few questions, uncover the right clues at the right time and to then die off or just disappear until a sequel.  There's some attempt to build mystery and the film does try to build suspense... but can't maintain it since the Big Bad of the picture (the Son of the Devil and the Spear of Destiny) virtaully has to walk over five hundred miles before it can even remotely become a threat to Constantine or the world.  By the time it finally arrives, both we and Constantine see it coming a long way off.  But the movie does try to pull a fast one at the end with the real battle taking place between Constantine and Satan.  Peter Stormare's performance here is like a heart attack - sudden, attention grabbing and turns the world upsdie down.  There's a good reason why Reeves is already on the floor in these scenes, if he had been standing Stormare's passion for the part would have cut him off at the knees.<br /><br />Overall Constantine is a sharp looking picture with a lot of soft focus characters and plot.  It looks like a lot of films you've already seen (there's a strong DARK CITY vibe going on in the film), but holds enough water for it to be something worth watching.  For the careful viewer who takes the time to tie in all the background images and visual clues there's more going on than meets the eye.<br /><br />I only had the single disc editon here - so all the snazzy features and commentary are lost to me.  The single disc does feature deleted scenes with optinal commentary, and while nice,(I like the original ending better - and felt that the one they used for the final film could have been blended into it easily and been that much more powerful for it) neither really add or subtract from the film.<br /><br />In the end, CONSTANTINE works... but only just.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>CONSTANTINE follows one story of many in the life of John Constantine (played by Keanu Reeves), an addicted smoker who once tried to took committed suicide as a boy, but was miraculously brought back to life. Since that time he has been able to see the spiritual world manifested in our world wherever he goes. He sees both the forces of good & evil for what they are. However, since he committed the mortal sin of suicide, Constantine is not allowed to enter Heaven. Trying to pay his way to salvation through works, Constantine sets forth on a battle against the demons & other forces of evil to save and rescue as many souls from the clutches of Hell as possible. Along the way, he sends as many half-breed demons as he can back to Hell. Constantine has become so good at doing what he does that they say his is one of only a handful of souls that Satan himself will come to collect when he dies.<br /><br />Anyway, towards the beginning of the movie Constantine performs an exorcism in which a full-fledged warrior demon was attempted to cross over from the spiritual world into our world. This isn't supposed to happen and signals a shift in the balance between good & evil. Constantine knows something big is happening, but he just doesn't know what. It takes him a couple trips to Hell and back and meeting up with a psychic cop to piece the puzzle together and then it's up to Constantine and company to save the world before all Hell breaks loose.<br /><br />CONSTANTINE is based upon the Hellblazer comics and since I've never read the books I cannot at this time comment on the accuracy between the books and the movie. What I can say is that despite the criticism Reeves constantly gets, he does a good job in this movie. For years he has been haunted by the BILL & TED persona, but thanks to a large part to the Matrix, Reeves has come into his own. It is possible that he might now be typecast as a sort of everyman-superhero/action figure, but he fits those roles perfectly.<br /><br />The special effects in the film are pretty amazing, especially the visits to Hell. The action is well-paced and, for an action/comic book movie, the development of the characters is well done.<br /><br />There are certain elements of the plot that are a bit confusing at first (orders of demons for instance or what's the deal with water). There are also some problems with the theology presented in the film. However, if one sits back with an open mind and allows the movie to work it's magic one can be swept away in an adventure that is both entertaing and thoughtful.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>I was actually really looking forward to seeing this movie. I loved the poster - it's not totally obvious first time round that Keanu actually appears in it. I'm also a big fan of the lovely Keanu. I'd never previously heard of the comic.<br /><br />I was kinda disappointed by the movie, and also found it really boring. It's got some cool effects, it's got a good cast, but nothing much happened for me. Keanu is great, and I was surprised I didn't find the continuous smoking a turn off, as I would normally. I'm sorry, I would not date a guy who smoked. But despite the constant chain-smoking throughout the first half of the movie, by the time the second half hits, he's too busy fighting demons to light up a cigarette.<br /><br />I liked Rachel Weiz's character in this, although boy, would I like to pluck her eyebrows for her!!! I wasn't so sure about the Keanu/Rachel pair up again, after what happened with Chain Reaction, but they didn't do too bad. There's no chemistry though. Also, Rachel makes a major fashion boo boo in this - she wears a white shirt with a black bra under through most of the movie. And then promptly gets wet/dunked in a bath etc. Deliberate? Could she not have worn a white bra? It was really Rachel in the scene where her character flies backwards through the building. This was achieved by strapping her to a chair on a track and moving the chair back really quickly. The surrounding office was later generated on computer to achieve the scene. She also went to the morgue as a part of the research into her character. A life-size replica of Rachel was made and used as the corpse of Angela Dodson's twin sister Isabel who committed a suicide.<br /><br />I've read quite a few of the press articles about this, and Gavin Rossdale (who's married to Gwen Stefani, for people who don't know) always seem to be chattering away about the movie. He hardly appears in it! He appears for a couple of scenes and that's about it! Satan appears in it for longer than him. A hard day's work that was!<br /><br />Apparently, after the credits, there's an epilogue to the action of the movie, with Constantine leaving his lighter on a gravestone, whereupon an angel appears. Of course, seeing it in the cinema, no one stays past the first name appearing on the credits, so I'll no doubt catch that bit on DVD. (There are no opening credits by the way, only the company logos, and the title, for people who tend to skip past the start credits on DVDs, like me.)<br /><br />The logos for Warner Bros, Village Roadshow Pictures, and The Donner's Company, all appear, smoulder and crumble in the hell setting.<br /><br />I thought the whole Hell scenes were done really well, quite a different take on normal scenes. Actually the only Hell scenes I can think of from other films is Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey! :) Or the Matrix movies, those were kinda hell-ish. Ooops, I didn't mean that! I like those!<br /><br />In the comic book "Hellblazer" on which the movie is based, the character of John Constantine is from Liverpool. In the movie, the character is from Los Angeles. It is widely believed that the character of John Constantine was changed to an American so that Keanu Reeves could play the role. The truth is the original script retained his nationality but got no response from producers. So the writer changed him to an American and the script quickly gained attention. Although the movie Constantine is based on the comic book Hellblazer, the movie title was changed because it was too similar to Hellraiser. The comic book itself was actually meant to be called Hellraiser, but Clive Barker came up with the title first.<br /><br />The character of Father Hennessy is a mixture of three of Constantine's allies from the comic book. They are Nige Archer who was a psychic, Ric the Vic who was a priest, and Header who was a portly substance abuser. And, like Hennessy, all are killed for being associated with Constantine.<br /><br />The tattoo on constantine's arms is the alchemical symbol of the Red King, which was worn (by him) for protection. It is "the fire triangle with three radiating arrows below represents the "Perfect Red King," the Sulfur of the Philosophers."<br /><br />The "Spear of Destiny" prop is the same one as used in Hellboy. I have to admit I'd never previously heard of the spear used to kill Christ on the cross called by this before. I liked Stigmata, and there's a lot of religious imagery in that, but I don't think you're supposed to get most of the religious stuff in this. It's very different.<br /><br />A character named Ellie, who was a demon Constantine dealt with early on, was completely cut from the film. Francis Lawrence stated that she was left on the cutting room floor because he wanted Constantine to be completely alone when he meets Angela. He also stated that an unrated DVD would contain Ellie's scenes. Ellie was played by Michelle Mognahan.<br /><br />I'm still not sure what to think about this movie, it's one of those movies that doesn't know quite what it's supposed to be, and relies heavily on religious imagery. It was just OK, I guess. I reckon this will get a few bad reviews, simply because people won't 'get' it. I got the feeling that the film was also trying to portray that everything you know about religion is wrong.<br /><br />Oh, and if you're a fan of the comic book, you know you're going to probably hate this out of loyalty to the comic book, so it's probably best not to.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Francis Lawrence<br /><br />Cast:  Keanu Reeves, Rachel Weisz, Shia LaBeuof, Djimon Hounsou, Max Baker, Pruitt Taylor, Gavin Rossdale, Tilda Swinton, Peter Stormare.<br /><br />Running Time:  121 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for ghastly violence, gore, and language.<br /><br />The success of the "Matrix" films shot "Speed" and "Point Break" action hunk Keanu Reeves into another stratosphere of stardom.  His depiction as Neo Anderson in the celebrated trilogy showed more depth and ability than any other role that he had attempted in the past.  "Constantine" does not showcase his talents much like the "Matrix trifecta, but manages to vividly extract every ounce of respectful acting that was once apart of him.  Reeves plays John Constantine, a cross between Same Spade and Repairman Jack from the F. Paul Wilson novels.  Constantine, a combination supernatural detective and exorcist who is on the verge of dying of lung cancer from smoking, and is a complete jerk to anyone he meets.  He deals with all kinds of supernatural occurrences all around Los Angeles. He builds a kind of reputation that is only heard in whispers and rumors and he's quite known for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Enter Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) who needs his help with the mysterious suicide of her twin sister who jump off the roof of the mental hospital she was staying in. She believes that there is more to it than it seems and wants Constantine to help her figure it out.<br /><br />Decent yet very incoherent adaptation of the "Hellblazer" comic lacks that book's sense of humor and complexity and goes for the gusto in stupidity with a very poor performance by Keanu Reeves, who manages to make his last two "Matrix" films look like masterpieces compared to his work here. Director Francis Lawrence tries hard but lacks focus in certain scenes and lacks a sense of continually with his work. He steals from the best but lacks the substance to pull it off. The only redeeming things this movie has to offer is the performance of Rachel Weisz, who manages to give a strong, complex and moving performance despite the fact that the movie is not worthy of it.  Overall, "Constantine" had a good concept, but fails with its execution. To those who want intelligence in a movie, this film certainly strained a lot of the foundation from the comic book and crammed it with religious theories and random babble. Those who want mindless action and dazzling effects, "Constantine" succeeds by giving them just that. But in the end, there wasn't enough action to keep that segment of the audience's attention, and the depth the film supposedly had never really showed up.</p></br><a href="../users/ASIA7V7CBSKD3.html">ASIA7V7CBSKD3</a><br/><p>I'm not a big Keanu Reeves fan to begin with, but this movie just didn't do it for me.  Granted the viewer has to come into this movie with some prior knowledge of religion, but that aside this movie failed to entertain me.  Gavin Rosedale does a pretty good job in what I believe is his first major acting job.  Rachel Weis is solid as well.  My gripe about this movie is the story, not the actors.  You might find this entertaining, but I found it to be a waste of my time and money.</p></br></body></html>

Using considerable restraint and an non-exploitative approach, Stone explores the trauma and the tensions involved in rescuing these 2 heroic firefighters and the effects it had on their families.  By personalizing this story, Stone has not trivalized this important story but has created a tribute to these two men and a memorial to those who died risking their lives in this tragedy.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>While I fully recognize Oliver Stone's great talents in making films, I avoid his films because I cannot forgive him for "JFK" and its countless lies that have confused millions about the Kennedy assassination.  However, when my daughter rented this film I thought I would take a look and see what he did with it.  It is magnificent.<br /><br />This is the story of the two officers who were pulled from under the rubble of the Trade Center the day after the buildings fell on them as they were heading to rescue work through the concourse.  John McLoughlin (Nicholas Cage) was the officer in charge of the team and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena) was the rookie.  They, with several others, were pulled off their normal duty and sent to the WTC to help get people out of the buildings.  McLoughlin had a great deal of experience with the buildings because he had worked there before.  Jimeno volunteered to go with him because, as the new guy, he figured he wanted to stay with the guy with the most experience.  The scene as they head into the tower is quite powerful and shows us how dangerous and heroic it was to simply walk or run towards the building.<br /><br />They had just gathered more equipment and were heading towards rescuing some people stuck in the elevators when WTC 2 fell.  They didn't know the second tower had even been hit, but they happened to be in a good place and McLoughlin had the presence of mind to tell his team to run towards a stronger part of the building.<br /><br />I have to admit that I had when I heard two officers had been pulled out of the rubble of the concourse, I had envisioned them being largely OK and simply trapped.  No.  They were pancaked in the rubble.  In the commentary (which I strongly urge you to listen to), Jimeno and the rescuers say it was ten times more constricted than shown in the movie with smoke and dust that made it even more claustrophobic.  However, if they had tried to depict it as it was, there could be no movie, because you couldn't see anything.  Still, the sets help us understand the horrible conditions these men were in.<br /><br />While the story of these men is well known, I don't want to go over the whole story, because no matter what you think you know, it is unlikely that you know the story completely enough to no be shocked at what they went through.  There was a third officer who survived the initial collapse and who did his level best to try and get Jimeno out, but no one could do it without special power equipment.<br /><br />The depiction of what their families went through is also portrayed beautifully.  We get to see up close what it was like for those who waited without knowing, the misinformation that got back to them, and what it was like when they first got the full scope of the truth.<br /><br />Another interesting character is Dave Karnes, who felt called to go down to ground zero to look for survivors.  In the commentary, Jimeno points out that he and no one knew that Karnes was African American until after the film was made and that he felt badly about it.  Even so, Michael Shannon portrays him very well.<br /><br />There is a lot to this story that you will want to know.  And it is very moving.<br /><br />I hope Stone doesn't do the paranoid conspiracist version of 9/11 I heard is preparing to make, but at least that movie would be more in character for him.  This film is beautifully done and shows his artistic powers without his very odd view of the world.<br /><br />Jimeno says that the film does make a few changes to reality because they were making a PG 13 film and that Stone had to compress 24 hours into 2.  Still, others have complained that this or that rescuer or act was not depicted in the film.  Truly, not everyone who should be recognized could be recognized in this or any film.  Still, we are grateful to every one of them.  As you watch with the commentary, Jimeno and the other rescuers point out the real people (including Jimeno and McLaughlin) who were given cameos in the movie.  A very nice touch.<br /><br />Strongly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>The real-life story of Port Authority officers caught up in the 9/11 tragedy opens with quiet and realistic descriptions of their jobs in New York. The whole tragedy is depicted as seen from the viewpoints of these hard-working officers and their families, and the film is given strength because of this narrative approach as far as its opening 30 minutes go.<br /><br />One of the film's horrifying scenes is, of course, the first chapters where the panic is shown after two airplanes hit the Twin Towers. Oliver Stone presents us what we witnessed on TV then from another viewpoint - I don't repeat it here - and though it is true that he restrained himself from showing too much, he still seems to have been tempted. I can say the scenes of the officers arriving World Trade Center is realistic, and maybe too realistic to some.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage with low-key performance plays Jim McLoughlin, real-life officer who knows the place better than anyone. What happened to Jim McLoughlin, Will Jimeno, another actual person (played by Michael Pe&ntilde;a) and other officers of the rescue team is described next, which is simply terrifying. The story of the film's earlier part is told fast and straightforward, and what they experienced is conveyed convincingly to us.<br /><br />And then, after the collapse of the buildings the film starts to use another narrative technique, switching between the officers trapped underground and their families waiting at home. Then things get a little - how should I say? - not good. I respect those people involved in the filmmaking, but why Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello? Or why Nicholas Cage in the first place? I am not talking about their talent (which I am ready to admit), but no matter what they do, their faces are recognizable as Maggie, Maria and Nicholas. Somewhere in my mind I feel they are acting.<br /><br />And this is the part I disagree with the film. Though `World Trade Center's is based on true story, it sometimes makes us feel otherwise. Though its timeline is compressed, the story gets slow and some images look clich&eacute;d. Maybe I should not say this, I know, but the frequent flashbacks showing the happy days, the film's big visual and sound effects and occasional soundtrack music are clearly those of Hollywood films. I'm not saying that Hollywood studios are all bad; I can feel the goodwill of the people involved in making this film. I'm only saying that there may be another approach better than the one employed here: no `stars,' no effects, just facts.<br /><br />This leads us to the inevitable comparison with `United 93.' It is not fair to compare them because these two incidents are not the same, yes, I know, but I need to do it to make my point. Paul Greengrass succeeded in shooting his film about the hijacked airplane which is emotionally involved by making it very lean. And Oliver Stone's film is also lean and effective up until the moment when the film attempts to tell another story -- story about the family, which, I think, needs and deserves another film to tell.<br /><br />`World Trade Center' has moving scenes as well as very disturbing ones. Despite its undeniable merits, however, you will feel the film is uneven and perhaps a bit sentimental. As to the sentimentality, I confess that I also shared the feeling while watching, but I still don't know if I was right in feeling that way.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LPQAPU2ILDD0.html">A3LPQAPU2ILDD0</a><br/><p>Though this film can be overlong, and I thought "United 93" was a better re-inactment of events, it's definitely time to tell the good that arose from the rubble. Great visuals; the feel of 9/11 comes across extremely well. But long extended pre-rescue and rescue scenes just don't hold the attention of film audiences for long. Not many multiple viewings for this type of movie on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Compared to the visceral power of the documentary-like "United 93", maverick filmmaker Oliver Stone atypically goes a more traditional route in focusing his 2006 film on the two police officers who were able to survive the collapse of the World Trade Center at Ground Zero. Instead of going for an emotional gut-punch on a broad canvas, the controversial filmmaker plays it safe by depoliticizing the film from possible conspiracy theories and emphasizing far more on the personal impact. The result still works powerfully, but the movie sometimes feels myopic in making the rest of the day's tragedies a mere backdrop for the central story. Moreover, screenwriter Andrea Berloff, working from the remembrances of the real people, brings a certain TV-movie-level predictability to the narrow focus of the plot despite the devastating power of key scenes.<br /><br />The movie takes advantage of the audience's knowing anticipation of the events at the beginning, but Stone blessedly doesn't exploit the tragedies more than necessary. While he incorporates global reaction to the events, the story quickly hones in on John McLoughlin, who leads a volunteer brigade of four Port Authority officers to the site. In the midst of their evacuation efforts, they find themselves buried in the rubble with McLoughlin and Will Jimeno the only two who survive under several feet of debris. The film then alternates between the dark desperation of the two immobilized men and the agonizing waiting game experienced by their families. There is no getting around the harrowing personal drama unfolding, and Stone is careful not to step out of bounds when it comes to the heroism displayed that day by all the real-life characters shown.<br /><br />The acting is quite sturdy and well-grounded. After a long drought since "Adaptation", Nicolas Cage plays the taciturn McLoughlin economically, while Michael Pe&ntilde;a, who provided the most riveting moments in the otherwise manipulative "Crash" last year, brings an honest combination of ebullience and poignancy to Jimeno. Even though the wives are decidedly secondary roles here, Maria Bello continues to gain stature in her gritty portrayal of McLoughlin's wife Donna, while Maggie Gyllenhaal plays closer to the vest as Jimeno's pregnant wife Allison. As the rescuers, Michael Shannon plays former Marine Dave Karnes with steely, singular resolve, and Stephen Dorff and Frank Whaley make vivid impressions as fireman Scott Strauss and reactivated paramedic Chuck Serieka, respectively. Seamus McGarvey contributed the evocative cinematography, and Jan Roelfs' production design is piercingly accurate to our collective memories of how Ground Zero looked on that fateful day. It's a fine, moving drama in many ways but in certain respects, too safe in Stone's hands.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I was not a huge fan of United 93 as a movie. The subject matter is certainly valid, but I thought as a movie, the story was not told well and by the end of the movie I was mad and looking for revenge! World Trade Center on the other hand is also valid subject matter and a gripping inspirational movie! A fitting tribute to our public servants and to our country. This film was much better than I expected. The DVD transfer and extras are very good.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>In 2006, acclaimed director Paul Greengrass ("The Bourne Ultimatum") delivered to audiences a powerful look at what may have transpired aboard United Airlines flight 93 on that dark day in September in his docu-drama "United 93". That same year, the highly controversial, yet popular director Oliver Stone ("Alexander") brought his view to the events of that day by chronicling some of the rescue efforts taking place at Ground Zero in the equally powerful and moving "World Trade Center" starring Nicolas Cage ("Ghost Rider"), Maria Bello ("A History of Violence"), and Michael Pena ("Shooter").<br /><br />"World Trade Center" begins on the morning of September 11th, 2001 and continues on into that evening, chronicling the horrifying hours spent buried beneath the rubble of Towers 1 and 2 by survivors numbers 18 and 19, John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena). As the minutes stretch into hours, John and Will struggle to keep each other awake and to not lose hope that they will soon be rescued, while back at home their loving wives (Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhall) cling to their family members and try to remain optimistic and strong, holding on to the hope that they will once again be reunited with their husbands.<br /><br />When it was announced that the events of September 11th were going to be captured on film by both "United 93" and "World Trade Center", some felt that it was too soon, or that the films would in some way exploit that day, disrespecting all who lost their lives that day and the heroes who tried to save them. For "United 93" that was pretty much where the criticism ended, but for "World Trade Center" another concern was that its director, Oliver Stone, would use his film as just another vehicle for his conspiracy theories as he had done before in the films "JFK" and "Born on the Fourth of July". However, when both films were released to theaters all of the concerns regarding the content were quickly silenced. Both films showcased the utmost respect for those who were victims of that day whether they be those on the planes, or trapped in the rubble beneath the buildings, or the families left behind, all were honored and never once exploited.<br /><br />For those of us that were pleased by the outcome of Oliver's effort, there were some people that were disappointed in him for not presenting a more controversial viewpoint in "World Trade Center", feeling that by choosing to make a more balanced and accurate account of that day, he had somehow sold out. I for one was proud of Oliver Stone for making, what is for him a brave decision, to set aside his penchant for controversy, and make the best movie he could make to accurately depict what these people went through and to honor their sacrifice. Bravo, Mr. Stone. You've now come one step closer to realizing that there's not always a covered-up conspiracy behind every major event in human history, and that you don't have to use controversy to make a great film.<br /><br />The performances in "World Trade Center" were excellent all across the board. The most impressive performances were those of Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena, who for about 90% of the movie were buried beneath dirt, and realistic looking rubble with essentially only their faces in plain view. For an actor to not be able to make gestures of any kind while talking must be a very difficult test of their ability, I mean even everyday people rely heavily on their hands to get their points across in any given conversation (even when on the phone), so for an actor to be forced to only rely on their facial expressions to convey their feelings and actually succeed in doing so is a huge testament to their talent. The supporting cast led by Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhall were equally strong, and consisted of some of the most emotional aspects of the movie, as the wives focus inward to cope with the fear of losing their husbands, while on the outside remaining strong for their children and/or relatives. Rounding out the cast were two highly capable actors, Stephen Dorff ("Blade") and Michael Shannon ("Bug"), who portrayed two of the most pivotal people in regards to John and Will's rescue, the lead rescuer Scott Strauss and the marine who discovered their location, Dave Karnes. Though their roles were essentially cameo appearances, both men delivered very strong, believable performances; and for Stephen Dorff, it was possibly one of the best roles I had seen him in to date.<br /><br />Earlier, I stated that all concerns regarding the two films were silenced upon their release (especially those regarding "World Trade Center"), this is true for most of the concerns, all except for one. The concern of some that it was just too soon was a concern that still remained even after the release, and for some it will never cease to be too soon. But for everyone else, "World Trade Center" is a film that should be watched, as it is an incredibly moving piece of cinema that celebrates everything that is great about the American spirit; our courage, compassion, self-sacrifice, inability to give up, and above all, our hope.<br /><br />"World Trade Center" is rated PG-13 for language and disturbing images.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M5FI4CB6VUXF.html">A2M5FI4CB6VUXF</a><br/><p>I do understand there are some historical inaccuracies, but honestly isn't that Hollywood for you? You don't watch a Hollywood film expecting a documentary. If you want a 9/11 documentary, tune into Discovery or History Channel. In Hollywood, you watch a good story play out on the silver screen. You're taken to another place and time then left to use your Personal Computer to do research that will help you separate fact from fiction. (or do like I said and watch Discovery Channel!)<br /><br />This story stays very close to the truth of 9/11. It stays very true to the danger, the heartache and the tragedy of the day. And it ends very triumphantly, which is the purpose. It is what can best be termed historical fiction. It's based in fact, much like Titanic was, (even features real people, much like Wyatt Earp or what have you) but contains events that have been stretched, strained, morphed, adapted, edited and deleted.<br /><br />It's called a movie!<br /><br />I believe this movie was very well done and stayed very close to the feel of the day. When it's all said and done, that's what a HOLLYWOOD product should do.<br /><br />I have to tell you that I'm clausterphobic and this movie really got to me. I truly felt like I was in that small cramped space with them. I felt the building fall down. I felt the urgency, the fear, the sadness. I wasn't in NY on 9/11, but boy I sure felt like I was while watching this movie.<br /><br />And like another person said, if we watched this movie and "Flight 93" every day, maybe we'd remember who the real enemy is.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>Wow.  It's almost hard to put into words to describe this movie.  I can say that have kleenex handy because you'll need it.  Never in my entire life have I cried for so long and so hard during a movie.  No movie has ever affected me this way.<br /><br />Many of us remember that morning so vividly. September 11th, 2001.  I really wasn't sure if I wanted to see the film.  I remember watching the TV, glued to it, for answers to the questions that I never will have answered as to how something so horrible could happen. This film doesn't attempt to try to answer that question, instead it looks at the spirit of people and how we can come together to help others.<br /><br />I am so glad I decided to see this! It is a powerful work of film that tells the story without sensationalizing the event and the anger and hatred for the attackers following the attacks. It's a film of last words and feelings we tend to develop after years in a relationship. There are tears of joy, laughs, and tears of sorrow interlaced throughout this film with strong acting from a huge cast.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film although it may certainly be tough for those who lost loved ones in the buildings.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: "It's too soon! Too soon!" Those have been the outcries from almost everybody about Oliver Stone's World Trade Center. It was accussed of trying to exploit the event of profits, and basically people were just being people and were just speaking off the tip of their tongues. Well, the movie was really good. It's what you would expect from a historical picture, unfortunetly for us this event is pretty recent in our history. We watch WWII movies like Saving Private Ryan, Vietnam movies like Apocalypse Now, and all other war movies and the difference is that most people did not experience it first hand. Everyone here in the United States watched the towers fall, live, on their televisons. We watched them replay the footage over and over. So, a film of this nature is not too soon, it just has to be handled carefully. Oliver Stone made a great film, a film that celebrated the courage and will to survive rather than the actual terror of the situation. United 93 was a raw and very frightening experience, unlike this film. The only problem with the film is that in telling the tale you'll have to resort to old fashioned cliches. We know what happens at the end, and the story itself is no different than any other survival story. Just the fact that these people experienced it 5 years ago makes the difference and makes it unique. This movie is more of a tribute film rather than a piece of entertainment, no extraordinary cinematography or score, just a heartfelt and emotional story.<br /><br />ACTING: Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena display some fine acting as they take on the roles of two port authority police officers trapped in the rubble. It's hard to convey raw emotion when for the majority of the film has you trapped under concrete, but they really get in the state of mind. The acting is very excellent.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: A decent tribute that unfortunetly just doesn't exceed as a film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>This film is not entirely horrible, and it's one that we should all see at least once I'm sure, but the controversy regarding this film I think transcends a little deeper than whether or not our country was ready to face the events of 9/11 so boldly.  I feel that we were ready, but I'm afraid to say that this film just doesn't quite bring us there.  It delivers on a few levels but fails to really serve to the viewer the true feelings and emotions of that fateful day, mostly because the attacks are never seen and the devastating true story revolving to policemen John (Cage) and William (Pena) is so watered down that it loses every ounce of feeling while either of them is on screen.  That's not to sound harsh, and as I'm writing this I'm wondering how many pissed off Americans are going to rush to hit the `not helpful' button, but I have to be honest.  I felt absolutely nothing for either actor because to me they brought absolutely nothing to their character.  Michael Pena did do one up on Cage by revealing some depth in emotion on a few pre and post accident scenes, one when he first hears of the attack and is wanting to call his wife and the second when he is in the hospital fighting with his wife over the baby name (his wife Alison, played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, is pregnant in the movie).  Cage though was completely dead to me, evoking absolutely no emotion whatsoever, and Maria Bello floored me in her lack of depth for after her brilliant performance in last years `History of Violence' I expected the most from her.<br /><br />I did find a small glimmer of light though, and that was in the eyes of the extremely talented Gyllenhaal who just illuminates the screen every scene she as in and I'm hoping will finally pull out an Oscar nomination because of this.  If anyone in this film deserves it it's her.  Her tortured performance as a pregnant woman coming to terms with the fact she may indeed be a widow soon with the very fact that she must tell her four year old daughter hanging over her head was the most moving and emotionally gripping aspects of this movie, and quite frankly the only reason I shed a few tears (the whole scene where she's fighting with her husband (playfully) about the baby name is so touching).  The rest of the supporting characters are so underdeveloped and or just plain ignored that they become a waste of space, and in the case of Stephen Dorf and Michael Shannon, a complete waste of talent for even they brought absolutely nothing to the picture, Shannon going as far as to deliver one of the worst performances I've seen all year.  I guess I just expected a lot from this movie, I expected to feel so much different when walking out of it, but instead of feeling a sense of heroism for the two leads or a sense of remorse and or depression for that horrific day I was left wanting and even, dare I say, a bit annoyed that what should have and could have been a great and truly inspired film became nothing more than a movie.  It was okay, but nothing special, and judging by the source material it should have been something VERY special.<br /><br />I do feel a bit of sympathy for director Oliver Stone because it's obvious the man is a man of vision, he's just losing his footing somewhere in delivery.  This isn't his first falter for 2004's `Alexander' was an equal disappointment.  We all know that Stone can manage a good if not great film, for just look at `Natural Born Killers' or `Nixon'.  In the past Oliver was able to hone his skills and deliver to us a brilliant cinematic experience, but of late he's been so focused on the boring details that he loses the whole purpose of what he's trying to convey, he loses what really makes these stories worth telling, and in effect he loses us, the viewer, and that's a very bad thing.  I was skeptical about seeing this film because the critics were even saying that it was very watered down and unsatisfying, but I stuck to my guns like I always do and was prepared to once again disagree with the paid professionals, but in this case I have to suck it up, reign in my pride and eat crow because the critics were right.  It's not horrible, but it's not great, and that's a shame, because it should have been just that...great.<br /><br />At least we had Gyllenhaal...</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>"World Trade Center" is the true story of police officers John McLoughlin (Cage) and Will Jimeno (Pe&ntilde;a), who were trapped on the concourse between the North and South Towers, beneath the rubble when the Towers came down.  The movie follows them from early morning on 9/11/2001 to their rescue.  While trapped, they must rely on each other to survive long enough to be found.  A friendship forms in the most awful of places, and neither would have probably survived if it wasn't for the other.  It is also the story of their wives, Donna (Bello) and Allison (Gyllenhaal), and how they had to deal with not knowing what had happened to their husbands.<br /><br />"World Trade Center" is almost as good as "United 93", the other 9/11 movie from this year.  It has been made tastefully, and shows heroism in a terrible time of national crisis.  Cage and Pe&ntilde;a do good jobs as the two leads, spending most of their time under rubble where only there faces are shown.  They make these people real.  Oliver Stone's direction is good, and he makes the story very compelling.  This, along with "United 93" is one of the must see movies of the year.  I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/AF8C86SGYLH81.html">AF8C86SGYLH81</a><br/><p>Yesterday, on the 9th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, we watched Oliver Stone's "World Trade Center". It is a terrific film (third time I've seen it) and captures the tragedy very well. Four superb acting performances make this a 5 star gem. They are Nicolas Cage, Michael Pena, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello. It is a very emotional film and brings back those horrible memories of that fateful day. But it also captures the bravery and heroism of the police, firefighters and volunteers. The "World Trade Center" will definitely send chills down your spine and will bring tears to your eyes. While it may unveil as a very depressing film, it is so invigorating at the end and makes you proud to be an American. Give it a try...but don't be afraid to turn it off if it's too intense.  You won't be disappointed.  Oliver Stone has never disappointed me.</p></br><a href="../users/AGKPTMTR3UX1R.html">AGKPTMTR3UX1R</a><br/><p>It seems almost blasphemous to criticize this film. And perhaps WORLD TRADE CENTER is better than it seems. And perhaps the main difficulty with this movie IS that was simply too soon to treat Nine Eleven cinematically. Perhaps, perhaps.<br /><br />But the truth is that this Hollywoodization of America's darkest day is wholly inadequate in addressing its subject matter, despite a sincere attempt by all involved to make a responsible, quality film about the Trade Center disaster.<br /><br />Yes, it touches the event, transmitting about 1/1,000,000,000th of the emotion of the event to the viewer. WORLD TRADE CENTER is well-made, deserving of TWO AND A HALF STARS for good acting and authenticity, but it's focus is too narrow. By reducing itself to the story of a group of miraculously unharmed survivors, it never captures the vastness of the event or the eight million tragedies that crowded that moment in time. Despite the survival of small groups of the buildings' trapped occupants, this should not have been a film with a happy ending.<br /><br />Almost any currently-existing documentary about that day is more effective in speaking to the audience than is this film. (The conspiracy-theory-fueled College Boy film school junk film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016N52IK">Loose Change Final Cut</a> is an exception.)<br /><br />Unfortunately, WORLD TRADE CENTER does not succeed in bringing the event within the compass of our understanding.

Only the shadow of the first plane against a building is seen as it flies toward the WTC. Subtlety works. There was not a dry eye in the house. I recall the morning of September 11, 2001. I awoke at 6 A.M., went into the bathroom, looked in the mirror and decided to shave my head. I had never done that before. I cut my hair, shaved my head, went back to bed and went to sleep. The phone rang. It was my mother. She was crying. She said, "They've hit New York. They've hit Washington, D.C." I thought, "My God! We're in a nuclear war with China."

It's the scene that is forever burned in my brain.  We saw it hundreds of times, over and over, the local news couldn't help but show us it with a frequency that could only be called sadistic.  Since the scene is not present here the film works. Because it's not there the film has a resonance much higher and more powerful.  WORLD TRADE CENTER is a film that has all the cards stacked against it and succeed because it remembers that 9/11 was not a day about politics, it was not a day about heroes or villains.  No, 9/11 was a day about people doing their jobs and stepping up in the face of tragedy.<br /><br />When John McLoughin (Nicholas Cage)and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena) showed up for work on this morning they never expected to find themselves buried under the rubble of the Twin Towers.  They assumed the day would be pretty uneventful.  They kissed their wives, hugged their kids and went to work.  But, when duty called these men answered it, and found themselves trapped.  Leaving their families wondering, their friends comforting, and a country mourning. In a matter of hours these two Port Authority Police Officers fought for survival, and made themselves and many other men heroes.  A lot can happen in the midst of evil, and sometimes it can inspire the greatest good.<br /><br />What WORLD TRADE CENTER does best is transport us back to that day.  When we woke up that morning all was well, by the time we went to bed the whole world felt the repercussions. On September 11th politics was put on the back burner, our petty differences fell away, and we became united.  Some gave blood, others cleaned up, for one grand moment America seemed like one.  American flags flew, police and rescue workers streamed into the city to help, the once loathed Mayor became a hero, and the President's rally cries were heard and accepted.  Oliver Stone's film captures those moments with such reckless ease, its amazing he got away with it.<br /><br />The film is the embodiment of people who are holding onto the mundane problems in the world.  Holding onto the mundane because the gravity of the world around them is too much to bare.  My favorite moment involves Jimeno talking about the theme song to Starsky and Hutch.  On the surface it's a man trying to use comedy to quell his fear, but the scene goes deeper, this man is holding onto a stupid television show because it proves he's still alive.  Hollywood has given us heros whose lives are so exciting and are always exciting.  But real people have down time, they laugh, they go see stupid movies, and watch stupid television shows.  The only way to hold on is to revert to the mundane, it's the only cure for a world gone insane.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage and Michael Pena embody McLoughlin and Jimeno with real humanity.  The film traps them under rubble for most of the films running time, so all they have is their voices, their emotions, and their humanity to get them through.<br /><br />On the surface,  Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal play these men's wives with a vulnerability and fierceness.  We see their pain, none so clear, as when Gyllenhaal as Jimeno's wife wanders aimlessly around a pharmacy trying to clear her head, or getting out of the car because the red light is too long.  That light never seems so long as when you need to get somewhere fast.<br /><br />I've heard many say "how dare they make this movie?"  "How dare Hollywood profit from this tragedy?"  I say "how dare we leave our history to be written by people with an agenda., by people who didn't live through it?"  Ten years from now I would be proud to show this film to the next generation, to show them that amidst all the upheaval, amidst all the tragedy, America was united for one brief moment.  WORLD TRADE CENTER has no agenda except to harken back to a time we've since lost.<br /><br />WORLD TRADE CENTER is missing one key scene. It's missing the planes flying into the building.  This is not a film about terrorists, or evil. This isn't even a film about the Twin Towers.  This is not a film about planes, presidents, or what has happened since.  WORLD TRADE CENTER is a deeply moving example of people who wanted only one thing: to get home from work that day.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>Viewers of Oliver Stone films usually fall into two camps: those that admire his work and those that don't. I tend to like most of the director's films that I have watched and "World Trade Center" is no different.<br /><br />As is obvious by the title, the film takes place during that horrific day in September six years ago when the city of New York, along with the rest of the world, turned upside down due to the devastating attack on the city's landmark structures. Stone doesn't show too much of the archival footage of the death and destruction and that is probably for the best. The images are too ingrained into the American psyche that filmgoers and fill in the blanks, themselves.<br /><br />Instead, the film deals with two policemen trapped under the rumble and their struggles to survive, along with the worried families and the subsequent rescue attempts.<br /><br />Both Nicholas Cage - an actor that I usually don't like - and Micheal Pena acquaint themselves well as the cops. The actors really deserved Oscar nominations for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, respectively. Maria Bello, Maggie Gyllenjaal, Broadway veteran Donna Murphy are quite good as suffering wives of the trapped and fallen.<br /><br />Impressive cinematography by Seamus McGarvey and Craig Armstrong's' powerful score are other highlights of Stone's film.<br /><br />It is obvious that Stone sought to make a film that is in honor of those that suffered that fateful day and the director succeeds in crafting something for the mainstream, something that he's probably not done before.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>Compared to the visceral power of the documentary-like "United 93", maverick filmmaker Oliver Stone atypically goes a more traditional route in focusing his 2006 film on the two police officers who were able to survive the collapse of the World Trade Center at Ground Zero. Instead of going for an emotional gut-punch on a broad canvas, the controversial filmmaker plays it safe by depoliticizing the film from possible conspiracy theories and emphasizing far more on the personal impact. The result still works powerfully, but the movie sometimes feels myopic in making the rest of the day's tragedies a mere backdrop for the central story. Moreover, screenwriter Andrea Berloff, working from the remembrances of the real people, brings a certain TV-movie-level predictability to the narrow focus of the plot despite the devastating power of key scenes.<br /><br />The movie takes advantage of the audience's knowing anticipation of the events at the beginning, but Stone blessedly doesn't exploit the tragedies more than necessary. While he incorporates global reaction to the events, the story quickly hones in on John McLoughlin, who leads a volunteer brigade of four Port Authority officers to the site. In the midst of their evacuation efforts, they find themselves buried in the rubble with McLoughlin and Will Jimeno the only two who survive under several feet of debris. The film then alternates between the dark desperation of the two immobilized men and the agonizing waiting game experienced by their families. There is no getting around the harrowing personal drama unfolding, and Stone is careful not to step out of bounds when it comes to the heroism displayed that day by all the real-life characters shown.<br /><br />The acting is quite sturdy and well-grounded. After a long drought since "Adaptation", Nicolas Cage plays the taciturn McLoughlin economically, while Michael Pe&ntilde;a, who provided the most riveting moments in the otherwise manipulative "Crash" last year, brings an honest combination of ebullience and poignancy to Jimeno. Even though the wives are decidedly secondary roles here, Maria Bello continues to gain stature in her gritty portrayal of McLoughlin's wife Donna, while Maggie Gyllenhaal plays closer to the vest as Jimeno's pregnant wife Allison. As the rescuers, Michael Shannon plays former Marine Dave Karnes with steely, singular resolve, and Stephen Dorff and Frank Whaley make vivid impressions as fireman Scott Strauss and reactivated paramedic Chuck Serieka, respectively. Seamus McGarvey contributed the evocative cinematography, and Jan Roelfs' production design is piercingly accurate to our collective memories of how Ground Zero looked on that fateful day. It's a fine, moving drama in many ways but in certain respects, too safe in Stone's hands.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>One thing you won't see in Oliver Stone's World Trade Center is multiple explosions and images of planes flying into buildings. In this evocative reenactment of that fateful day, the director uses a lot of restraint, consequently we hear the planes hit the buildings but we never see them and we see the people racing from the scene bloodied and battered, and we also get the immense scale of the disaster through a spectacularly recreated set piece.<br /><br />With moderation and tact, Hollywood sentimentality is largely kept at bay, as the viewer is swept into a very personal account of what it must have been like to be trapped inside the wreckage and rubble of the giant towers.  The movie opens on the morning of September 11th and it's just like any other day in New York, the sun comes up, the Fulton Fish Market opens for business, and commuters get on the train or the Staten Island Ferry.<br /><br />Two Port Authority cops, Sgt. John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Officer Will Jimeno (Michael Pe&ntilde;a) go to work but little do they know what was to become of them that day. A tremor is felt in the P.A.'s offices within the World Trade Center, followed by confusion as McLoughlin leads his men from the Port Authority bus terminal toward the towers. They thread through fallen debris with the intent of evacuating office workers,<br /><br />McLoughlin, Jimeno and three others get to the concourse between the towers. Then the columns buckle, the first tower begins to collapse and the men are trapped. Their wives - Donna McLoughlin (Maria Bello) and pregnant Allison Jimeno (Maggie Gyllenhaal), along with thousands of other families have know idea where they are and what has happened to their husbands and scenes alternate between the trapped survivors who are trying desperately to stay awake and alive and their families who anxiously wait by the phone.<br /><br />The acting in this movie, particularly by Gyllenhaal and Bello is quite phenomenal - no mad histrionics here, just a deep anxiousness, confusion and sadness as both wives try to cope with the magnitude of the disaster in different ways. Donna sort of shuts down and goes into a state of temporal denial, whilst Allison ponders how she can begin to raise her children without a father.<br /><br />World Trade Center is far from a gripping and fast-paced thriller, and it doesn't glamorize or even cheapen the events of that day, rather the drama comes from how these men survived - keeping each other's spirits up when they were pinned down in pain and suffering internal bleeding. And these scenes, shot in a re-creation of Ground Zero masterfully built by production designer Jan Roelfs, are simple and direct in their concentration on the immobilized policemen.<br /><br />I have just one problem with this movie and that was the decision to cast Nicolas Cage as Sgt. McLoughlin. Maybe I'm biased, but I just didn't buy him playing a Port Authority Cop, his performance, especially in the opening scenes come across as a little forced. Still, the movie as a whole is generally well done with Stone successfully anchoring us in the chaos of ground zero.<br /><br />World Trade Center certainly isn't out to make a political statement about terrorism or the inaction of the government leading up to the disaster and the only view of the outside world comes from Cable TV which becomes a refrain of information feeds and sober political analysis, including a brief speech from the President.  But Stone is largely determined that his movie be about all of us, showing how these events happened to everyone, everyday people doing their jobs and living their lives.

Oliver Stone brings us the survival story of William J. Jimeno (Michael Pena) and John McLoughlin (Nicholas Cage) in every explicit detail.  The events develop quickly.  The movie focuses on short little scenes that work like snapshots from two family photo albums.  The day is recreated with all its mundane details, just waiting for everyone to have the rug pulled out from under them.  The unbelievable slowly reached our consciousness, and so it did even for those closest to the drama.  Just like 'United 93' we are given a section of the horror as it unfolds.  Both movies are reinactments; both use news footage and narrative to frame the story.  We soon see the building collapse, and the two brave policemen are captured beneath the rubble when they wisely ran for the elevator shaft.<br /><br />Then, the movie moves slowly.  Their ordeal becomes our ordeal, and their waiting becomes ours as well.  Their interspersed memories fill the narrative as any life would pass before one's eyes.  It becomes unnerving as rubble and fire pass their way past both heroes as they cling to life.  A pistol goes off accidentally from a colleague who didn't make it out alive.  We go back and forth to the homes where the news is settling in, and it becomes more desperate as the hours go by.<br /><br />People should decide if they want to see movies like 'United 93' and 'World Trade Center'.  One should respect that for some it is too early.  (It was/is an awful reality.)  But, for the rest of us, these movies are well-constructed and ably focused.  The former is more of a reinactment; the latter is more of a movie.  Both are both, and each offers a worthy chance to assimilate the events and grieve once more.  The world after the Millenium has reawoken us out of a dream state after 9/11, and movies that are this realistic can be healing and help us cope to the realities 9/11 presented.  A story of survival can plant the seeds of hope, especially when these seeds of awareness can help thwart a near disaster, like the one recently planned at Heathrow.  Oliver Stone says he has no political agenda.  This is no rationalization, but the blunt truth.  He even has two short, courageous speeches presented by President Bush and Mayor Guiliani meant to help us through the crisis.  He does the men, the families, the survivors, and casualties justice in his rendering of that awful day.  He also shows that the best of us can shine through in calamity.  In the end, just like 'Schindler's List,' everyone counts.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CL82UITQJLWS.html">A3CL82UITQJLWS</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed this movie. It reminds us of what went on at ground zero when the cowards , aka terrorists, attacked us on our soil, but in doing so united us together, stronger... as well as taught us in the war against terror we need to bring the fight to the enemy. Great acting & a few real touching moments towards the end. The fallen NYPD & FDNY will never be forgotten - I admire their courage. The human spirit & will to survive are portrayed well in this movie. Brother helping brother no matter what the risk may be.

I feel that we were ready, but I'm afraid to say that this film just doesn't quite bring us there. It delivers on a few levels but fails to really serve to the viewer the true feelings and emotions of that fateful day, mostly because the attacks are never seen and the devastating true story revolving to policemen John (Cage) and William (Pena) is so watered down that it loses every ounce of feeling while either of them is on screen. That's not to sound harsh, and as I'm writing this I'm wondering how many pissed off Americans are going to rush to hit the `not helpful' button, but I have to be honest. I felt absolutely nothing for either actor because to me they brought absolutely nothing to their character. Michael Pena did do one up on Cage by revealing some depth in emotion on a few pre and post accident scenes, one when he first hears of the attack and is wanting to call his wife and the second when he is in the hospital fighting with his wife over the baby name (his wife Alison, played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, is pregnant in the movie). Cage though was completely dead to me, evoking absolutely no emotion whatsoever, and Maria Bello floored me in her lack of depth for after her brilliant performance in last years `History of Violence' I expected the most from her.<br /><br />I did find a small glimmer of light though, and that was in the eyes of the extremely talented Gyllenhaal who just illuminates the screen every scene she as in and I'm hoping will finally pull out an Oscar nomination because of this. If anyone in this film deserves it it's her. Her tortured performance as a pregnant woman coming to terms with the fact she may indeed be a widow soon with the very fact that she must tell her four year old daughter hanging over her head was the most moving and emotionally gripping aspects of this movie, and quite frankly the only reason I shed a few tears (the whole scene where she's fighting with her husband (playfully) about the baby name is so touching). The rest of the supporting characters are so underdeveloped and or just plain ignored that they become a waste of space, and in the case of Stephen Dorf and Michael Shannon, a complete waste of talent for even they brought absolutely nothing to the picture, Shannon going as far as to deliver one of the worst performances I've seen all year. I guess I just expected a lot from this movie, I expected to feel so much different when walking out of it, but instead of feeling a sense of heroism for the two leads or a sense of remorse and or depression for that horrific day I was left wanting and even, dare I say, a bit annoyed that what should have and could have been a great and truly inspired film became nothing more than a movie. It was okay, but nothing special, and judging by the source material it should have been something VERY special.<br /><br />I do feel a bit of sympathy for director Oliver Stone because it's obvious the man is a man of vision, he's just losing his footing somewhere in delivery. This isn't his first falter for 2004's `Alexander' was an equal disappointment. We all know that Stone can manage a good if not great film, for just look at `Natural Born Killers' or `Nixon'. In the past Oliver was able to hone his skills and deliver to us a brilliant cinematic experience, but of late he's been so focused on the boring details that he loses the whole purpose of what he's trying to convey, he loses what really makes these stories worth telling, and in effect he loses us, the viewer, and that's a very bad thing. I was skeptical about seeing this film because the critics were even saying that it was very watered down and unsatisfying, but I stuck to my guns like I always do and was prepared to once again disagree with the paid professionals, but in this case I have to suck it up, reign in my pride and eat crow because the critics were right. It's not horrible, but it's not great, and that's a shame, because it should have been just that...great.<br /><br />At least we had Gyllenhaal...</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>There's no denying that September 11, 2001 was a dark, dark day, marked by needless violence and untimely deaths. I don't have a problem with a film being made out of it as long as it's respectful and unbiased. Oliver Stone has repeatedly said that he made "World Trade Center" with no political agenda in mind, and before seeing the movie, I was willing to believe him. Call me naive, but I just didn't think it possible for someone to be that disrespectful. Then I actually saw the film, and the truth of the matter came to light. It's overwhelmingly political, unfairly toying with the emotions of the audience by presenting a feel-good survival story. This is a preachy, cliche-ridden, melodramatic film, and it tugs at our heartstrings without any degree of integrity.<br /><br />This is the second film of the year to document the 9/11 attacks, the first being Paul Greengrass' "United 93." That was a much better film, presenting the facts in a straightforward way without relying on heavy emotion or big name actors. It didn't make a political statement; it just focused on the action, confusion, and chaos. The best thing about it was the way it ended; it didn't linger on the tragedy of the crash by showing depressing images of burning wreckage. We didn't even see the moment of impact. That was the absolute right way to go because the ultimate fate of the passengers is well established. Why prolong the sorrow by actually showing the end result? It was almost like documentary footage, and that was probably why it was such a fascinating film.<br /><br />This is more than I can say for "World Trade Center," which documents the real life Search and Rescue mission of Port Authority police officers John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno (played by Nicholas Cage and Michael Pena). While evacuating the North Tower of the World Trade Center, the building collapses, ultimately trapping them beneath thousands of tons of rubble. Remarkably, they survive (other team members were not so lucky). While lying in the wreckage, the two start a number of conversations, all of which inevitably lead to discussions of their wives, their children, and their attempts to stay alive. Haven't we heard this kind of dialogue before in other disaster movies? Did we really need to hear it all again in a film documenting a real disaster?<br /><br />I obviously don't know what the men actually said to each other that day, but I had a very hard time believing that anything said in this movie was accurate. Screenwriter Andrea Berloff loaded each line with cliches that only pass muster in sappy buddy flicks. I got so tired of hearing lines like, "We're gonna make it!" or "If you die, I die!" coming from Cage and Pena, and I definitely could have done without the, "Tell my wife I love her," sermons. There was no originality to this dialogue whatsoever; it was as flat and unimpressive as something written by an amateur. Even the way specific characters interact made use of worn out storytelling methods; when McLoughlin's wife waits in the hospital for word of her husband's condition, she runs into another woman who feels guilty because she yelled at her son. It was the last form of communication they had before he entered the World Trade Center. How convenient; the two found each other just as the audience is hoping for McLoughlin's safe return.<br /><br />McLoughlin, Jimeno, and their wives Donna and Alyssa (played by Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal) were involved with the film's production. Donna is quoted as saying, "We got involved because we felt it needed to be done accurately. We wanted to do the right thing and I think the filmmakers wanted to do the right thing too." I wonder if she said this knowing just how far Stone wanted to go with the melodrama; at a certain point, Jimeno closes his eyes and sees the image of a blurry, heavily lit Jesus carrying a bottle of water. I found that incredibly inappropriate; an image like that only encourages a biased mode of thinking.<br /><br />Interwoven with the scenes of McLoughlin and Jimeno are scenes of their wives. They're both understandably panicked; they know for sure that both men entered the towers, but for most of the film, they don't know whether or not they survived. They struggle with conflicting emotions, going back and forth from desperate to cautiously optimistic. As the day turns to evening and then to night, they both experience flashbacks. Of course, they remember the good moments, like frightened wives always do in films like this. There's the moment when McLoughlin teaches his son the right way to saw wood. There's the moment when Jimeno and Alyssa lie in bed discussing what they should name their next baby (Alyssa is five months pregnant during the film). There's even the moment when McLoughlin is on the roof and he accidentally bangs his hand with a hammer. He and Donna look at each other with classic spousal love: a perfect moment for the audience to feel even more upset than they already are.<br /><br />And then there's Dave Karnes, a military officer played by Michael Shannon. When we first see him, he's in a church staring up at a cross while telling the pastor that he needs to go to Ground Zero and help. This is clearly a noble, courageous thing to do. I praise the real Dave Karnes for lending a hand; New York certainly needed all the help it could get. But I had many problems with the film Karnes. The fact that church was where he made a vow to "fight the enemy" was in no way subtle on Stone's part. You can't include a scene like that and then expect me to believe this movie has no political agenda.<br /><br />I'm in no way denying the reality or the scope of that terrible day, nor am I denying the fact that "World Trade Center" portrays it with extreme poignancy. The problem is that every moment is so heavy handed that it manipulates the audience into submission. There are many scenes that are so touching that they overwhelm us, which in turn distracts us from realizing we're being played like harps. This is not a respectful reinterpretation of a true story; this is an over the top soap opera, made with the intention of turning the audience into weepy drones. September 11 was a national tragedy. If a film is going to be made about that day, it at least should show some decency; the last thing the victims' families need is to be robbed of their dignity. It's the last thing the American public needs.<br /><br />Too bad Oliver Stone didn't think of this when making "World Trade Center"; it's such a shallow film, coming off only as an excuse for unnecessary melodrama. I urge you not to waste your tears on it. It doesn't deserve praise, nor does it deserve respect. What it does deserve is a quick death at the box office.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5VLIJMDPWHI.html">A2C5VLIJMDPWHI</a><br/><p>Cons: I've never been to New York, but from what I hear about it, the city is very diverse. However, from the look of the film, you would think majority of the city was all white and Latino. I didn't see any black firefighters, police officers, doctors, etc. I know there was a little controversy about a statue being built in NY that didn't show one black law enforcement person in it. I also didn't understand why there was this long trail of people pulling out two people from the rubble. Everybody seemed to want to put their hands on the people who'd been removed, but isn't that kind of dangerous if somebody was to drop him? The long trail of people just seemed unlikely to me, or maybe it really was like that.<br /><br />Pros: I thought ALL of the actors did a great job of capturing the moment. I couldn't figure out why they were treating the one Latino guy like he was the helper instead of one of the officers. Did he had bad asthma or something? I might've missed that. He was the guy who they wanted to stay with the equipment. I enjoyed watching the interpretation of what happened that day. The stats at the end of the movie were eye opening. I didn't know that only 20 escaped, but I did know thousands came up missing. I definitely enjoyed the film. It's just the cons that sat with me while watching it.</p></br><a href="../users/A21VGNU5959O85.html">A21VGNU5959O85</a><br/><p>Oliver Stone is a movie maker, his bottom line isn't to tell us the truth , its to make as much money as he can. September 11th, being so close to all of our hearts and souls, and it being so soon after the fact, Is a hard story to tell especially in regards to the survivors and victims. Stone did not choose to tell this story, in all its heroism and individual sacrifice, in the light of truth. Instead he decided to bend and twist these men's rescue and the rescuers stories to his "bottom line" agenda. In the movie NYPD officer Scott Strauss is the man who crawls through hell to get to John and Will, in real life it was Chuck Sereika. Chuck had absolutely NO training in search and rescue and extrication, He was a paramedic who thought for sure he was crawling to his own death. In interviews with Chuck after viewing the movie said "the facts are so distorted that he didn't recognize what he was seeing as what he lived through" A journalist who was at ground zero and did first hand interviews of both the rescuers and Will and John at the hospital asked the filmmakers if they wanted his input, and was declined. Oliver Stone chose to focus on the men trapped, flashbacks, family grief instead of on the true life harrowing story of the rescuers and their unbelievable acts.<br /><br />Stone missed many real facts that should have been put into the movie, and he added some that weren't necessary<br /><br />1) Karnes, the man who dons his marine garb and sneaks onto ground zero, did not spout religious phrases to passerby's. He refused to be any part of the film.<br /><br />2) The Other marine who shows up to help Karnes was a black guy, not a white guy<br /><br />3) They completely left out a firefighter named Tommy Asher, officer Richard Doeler, and John Busching former detective now paramedic in new york. ALL of those men were VITAL to the rescue effort!! Doeler literally DUG out John with his bare hands, with no oxygen tank. It was Doerler, along with two FDNY firefighters, who finally pulled McLaughlin to safety after three hours of digging. In the movie, a team made up solely of firemen extricates McLaughlin. In real life, Doerler came in to relieve many other rescue workers who had been digging for about five hours and working sometimes in 20-minute shifts as the conditions were too difficult to withstand any longer amount of time. Doerler fashioned scoops out of metal scraps, as his usual hand shovel wouldn't fit at first. But none of these dramatic details come through in the movie. Doerler, like Strauss and Sereika before him, had to straddle the trapped officer's body in order to fit in the narrow space, balancing himself on his right arm and reaching out with his left to pull out the mashed concrete and twisted metal bits--a task made more difficult by the fact that he is right-handed. he says that the filmmakers never called him once to hear his story firsthand. Doerler said he hoped his character would be included, not for his own credit but so that the world would know what the Nassau County Emergency Service Unit did that day<br /><br />4) The wife of Dominick Pezzulo, the NYPD officer who died along side John and Will is outraged at the filmmakers saying "my thing is, this man died for you, how could you do this to this family?"  Obviously scarred enough by his death, but also scarred again by the onscreen death as well, and not in a true light.<br /><br />Most people will watch this movie and take it as the truth, for how could someone make a movie about Sept 11 and leave out crucial, and important details, especially to tell a tale of "heroism and perseverance"?. Clearly it's because the filmmakers didn't care about the people who were really involved, they were out to fill their pockets. Don't buy this movie, don't watch it. Instead I would recommend, if you are curious about the truth of that day, to watch "9/11 The filmmakers commemorative addition" which is footage shot on that very day of the events unfolding and the heroism of the firefighters and NYPD involved</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>****<br /><br />Oliver Stone's "World Trade Center" is a well-made but difficult to watch theatrical experience. Much like Paul Greengrass' "United 93", both films are very similar in many regards with Stone taking a different approach in one major aspect of the filmmaking process.<br /><br />Stone goes the Big Budget Studio Route, recreating huge portions of the World Trade Center and parts of the destruction, shooting on the streets of New York, with a large cast of well-known actors. He attempts to recreate the real life dramatic story about the survival of two men, in the middle of a much larger event. It works, but a lot of the film's success could be derived from our knowledge of the event and the extent of our feelings still associated with the horror of that day.<br /><br />Stone concentrates the story, focusing our attention on a small group of Port Authority Policemen, led by Sergeant John McLoughlin (Nicholas Cage) and including the team's rookie, Will Jimeno (Michael Pena, "Crash"). As these men, and their co-workers, start their day, they have no idea what horrors the day will bring. But as soon as the World Trade Center is hit, they move into action. McLoughlin was instrumental in coming up with a plan after the '93 attack on the World Trade Center, so he is naturally the choice to lead an evacuation team. He asks for volunteers and these men, including Jimeno, set out to Tower 1. As they make their way, they learn of some problems at Tower 2, but go about their mission because all information is sketchy at this point. After they have gathered equipment, they head to Tower 1 and suddenly watch as the courtyard, where people are being treated, is covered with flaming debris. Then the two towers collapse, burying McLoughlin's team under twenty feet of rubble. Later, McLoughlin wakes up and finds that Jimeno is still alive. They both realized they are buried under rubble but hold hope they will be found.<br /><br />Stone and his team of technicians have done an amazing job of recreating the World Trade Center and the collapse, focusing on McLoughlin and his team, we experience this horrific event through their eyes. This is a believable, and not necessarily good thing. It makes the film very painful to watch. The majority of the film focuses on Cage and Pena buried under twenty feet of rubble, trying to keep each other alive, hoping for rescue. These scenes are interesting and powerful, but Stone cuts away from them to scenes involving their two wives, living through the horror. We see McLoughlin's wife, Donna (Maria Bello), dealing with the inaccurate information, the horror of the situation, the lack of knowledge as she has to try to calm their four kids. There are also scenes of Jimeno's pregnant wife (Maggie Gyllenhaal) dealing with the same things. What these cutaways do is remind us we are watching a film, a recreation of a horrible event. Every time we are reminded of this, we have to wonder why this film was made.<br /><br />Is it necessary to see a dramatic recreation of such a horrible event? If the film were made to offer some education or to posit an argument, I might say yes, but as a piece of entertainment, it seems a little early. In Woody Allen's "Crimes and Misdemeanors", Alan Alda's character, an obnoxious television producer, explains his theory about what makes something funny. The gist of his theory is that you can't make a joke about something that just happened, there is still too much pain involved. If you wait a while, you have more latitude. The character's a jerk, but what he says has a grain of truth. Stone abandons his usual conspiracy theories in favor of a very straight forward narrative, a recreation of the story of two men. Yes, the story is amazing, but is it necessary to see a film about it at this point in time?<br /><br />In "United 93", the film spent time showing us how the events may have transpired, providing a documentary-like look at the event. "WTC" is smaller in scope, but larger in scale, showing us the plight of two men when almost 3,000 died.<br /><br />As we return to Cage and Pena, we are constantly reminded that Nicholas Cage is playing this character, Maria Bello that character, Maggie Gyllenhaal that one. These are very recognizable actors and their presence, even when they are good, serves to remind us that we are watching a film. The performances are all good, and the film is very moving. But because we recognize these actors, especially Nicholas Cage, we are constantly reminded we are watching a `film'.<br /><br />I think it is too early for "WTC". Releasing the film just shy of the fifth anniversary of 9/11 seems like a marketing ploy. If the film were made in another five or ten years, I think it would be easier to accept the recreated nature of the film and it would serve as a good reminder of a horrific event.<br /><br />"United 93" is a more successful film for a variety of reasons. The film contains no name actors and is shot in a way that makes it appear to be almost a documentary. In "WTC", as McLoughlin and Jimeno are pulled out of the rubble, we see a line of emergency personnel standing at the edge of the iconic view of the rubble, carrying them to safety. How much time and money was spent recreating that location? There are huge sets, expensive production values. All of this combines to make the film seem phony.<br /><br />Also, "World Trade Center" is strangely apolitical. This is probably a good thing for any film about any aspect of this horrific day, but you would probably expect Oliver Stone to throw a theory or two in, point some fingers, try to ascertain who is behind the conspiracy. Because this doesn't happen, we have to wonder why they would go to all of the trouble to recreate the World Trade Center and put these actors, and us, through a horrific event. Because he doesn't say anything except look at these survivors, see how dramatic their tale is. We already get a sense of how dramatic any survivor's tale is. We don't really need to live through it with them.<br /><br />All this said, watching "World Trade Center" is a powerful experience, but I suspect a lot of this comes from the subject matter and the horror associated with the events of the day. As I watched Nicholas Cage reunite with Maria Bello at the hospital, I teared up. It is a powerful moment because I know a similar event actually happened to the two people they are playing. Because the film is based on the events of two real survivors, the film has a power it probably wouldn't have otherwise.</p></br><a href="../users/A1OBPHRXHZF8P6.html">A1OBPHRXHZF8P6</a><br/><p>When Oliver Stone was announced as the director for this movie, I initially thought that Hollywood lost its mind.<br /><br />Although my friend and her family then living in New York ultimately fared okay, we knew many others had not been. I worried that Stone would use the appointment as an excuse to deliver a blood-thirsty jingoistic diatribe against 'terrorists'--ironically not much different than what Washington D.C. was dishing out--and was wary of the film.<br /><br />Stone surprised me and perhaps many other Americans by instead going in the exact opposite direction. This film provides a glimpse of that day and Americans capacity for helping each other out in a time of crisis.<br /><br />The film centers on John McLoughlin (Nicholas Cage) and Michael Pe&ntilde;a (Will Jimeno), two Port Authority police officers who were among the first responders to the World Trade Center site. Faith and family sustain them as they realize they will also have to be rescued but wonder when.<br /><br />It also focuses on the tremendous emotional and psychological burdens their families endure in general and especially during that day. Stone wisely avoids his 'trademark' conspiracy in favor of just showing the heroism of these ordinary Americans and side-stepping politics. We don't even see the plane crash into the buildings.<br /><br />I also thought that Chuck Sereika, as an 'underdog' in this screenplay, is an interesting character. Before the attack he is a disgraced paramedic because his license to legally work is not current. However since 'all hands are needed on deck' during the day, he is actually among the people who rescue Jimeno and McLoughlin themselves on September 12th.<br /><br />The cinematography for this film is great--again considering the fantastic pressure everybody must have been under to make a one-dimensional title. The errors which do exist (there is a car model on the screen which was not made in 2001!) are minor and will not substantially detract from watching the story--both once and repeatedly. This is the account of 9/11 which Americans will actually like revisiting!<br /><br />Everybody CAN make a difference in this world!</p></br><a href="../users/A2T049UQONS0OY.html">A2T049UQONS0OY</a><br/><p>It seems incredible to me that liberal theorist Oliver Stone, who has turned over every cinematic stone en route to exposing "truths" about Vietnam, Watergate, Nixon and Kennedy -- typically to the chagrin of American conservatives -- has now produced a film that conservatives love and are falling over each other trying to see.<br /><br />Syndicated columnist Kathleen Turner, who is about as conservative as anyone in her trade, raved about the movie she saw during pre-release. She said she interviewed the real life characters portrayed in the movie and they told her the events were similar to what happened in real life. One of them, she said, was induced into coma for six months after his resuce so he could have 30 surgeries.<br /><br />Even Cal Thomas, who is perhaps the most conservative poison pen of all the political columnists, raved about the movie he saw in pre-release.<br /><br />This is quite a contrast to what people of this political ilk said after seeing "JFK", "Born On the Fourth of July", "Platoon" and "Nixon", where Stone took extreme measures to portray the truths of these situations. These were situations that did not induce likeness from the political right; quite the opposite, in fact. Stone was said to be an idiot, a historical revisionist that would re-write history to suit his own political purposes.<br /><br />Now, with "World Trade Center", he is the darling of conservative American when conservatism is more broad-based and more widely practiced than anytime since the Red Menace scare of the 1950s. All this because of a movie, a piece of art that reflects an actual event in history.<br /><br />Like usual, Stone has created an art form of extreme interest about an event many of us shared and on whcih we have divergent opinions. He is now the hero of mainstream conservative America because he made this movie, as if he now speaks from the other side of his mouth saying completely different things. It doesn't seem like a good enough reason for this to happen, to me.</p></br><a href="../users/A4X7FBQ5SKPI6.html">A4X7FBQ5SKPI6</a><br/><p>Stoney always tries to do movies about his generation.  Well he has a hard time accepting the fact that now his generation is retiring and living the good life.  Instead of moving to florida and buying comfy shoes, he decided to take on the latest american tragedy and make a movie about it.  I turned if off after I noticed several innacuracies, with the most glaring one of him portraying a black man as a white man.  Sure, ok, I know they could not find the humble marine who helped out that day, so what does stoney do???? Stoney casts some guy who is not even the same race as that guy.  I feel sorry for the real guy because he was cast wrong.  Just a glaring error that should have been fixed.  And although the jumpers were done well, it did not show how terrible it really was because people on the ground got hit by these jumpers.  Also want to say that hey, the men responsible should have been shown more as cowardly wooses.  Oh wait that will be in another movie, but by then we will get a PC movement like sum of all fears where they change them into modern day na-zis.  Ridiculous times call for ridiculous movies I guess.  Long live fireman and cops.  Does stoney have a son because is so maybe he can show who the real infidels are in a future movie!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>Okay, so here is another review dedicated to my Ammy twin, Mr. Know it All.  You knew this one was coming though.  I'd get into the whole `United 93 is a masterpiece and you really need to revisit that' but you can read my comments on you review of this train-wreck to know my stance on that.<br /><br />To be honest, I already wrote a review for this film a while back, but I have since switched personas here and thus have the opportunity to write a new one, just for you!<br /><br />Okay, so I'll get the obvious out of the way.  I just don't `get' Nicolas Cage.  Yes, he has moments of brilliance (`Leaving Las Vegas' & `Adaptation') and he even has moments of greatness (`Matchstick Men') but overall he is an emotionless mess who doesn't seem to understand how to emote anything other than a blank stare.  He's, in a word, ridiculous.  So, walking in I wasn't expecting much from him, so I can't say that his stagnant performance shocked me, since it didn't.  Michael Pena is an actor I am not really familiar with.  In fact, outside of this I'm really only familiar with his work in `Crash'.  For being such a retched film, `Crash' at least toted some memorable performances and, for me, Pena was one of the standouts (better than Dillon and far more deserving of an Oscar nomination).  Sadly, I think my expectations got the better of me for he was rather dull here.  I will give him the benefit of the doubt and blame it mostly on the script, which didn't give him much too really do.  In a few scenes (mostly when accompanied by Gyllenhaal) he actually makes an impact, so I see that his talent is still in tact.  Sadly, this film is beneath him.<br /><br />So, with two poor performances stuck in the middle of this film, it's kind of off to a bad start for me.<br /><br />As mediocre as Cage and Pena were though, this film is destroyed by Stone's direction.  It is just so stagnant of emotional impact.  The film really just meanders around, proving to be a wasted opportunity.  9/11 was such a tragic time and it still lingers as a haunting reminder of the fragility of peace.  That said, so many claimed that 2006 was just too soon to make so many films about the disaster.  I don't agree with that at all.  If the films had been done properly (ala `United 93') then we wouldn't have been attacking them as a nation.  `World Trade Center' serves as a valiant effort gone terribly wrong.  Stone is never one to back away from controversy, but this film seems so tame for him.  It doesn't challenge the audience at all.  He is a director that I am constantly on the fence with BECAUSE of his controversial visions, but at least when he challenges me I can admire his ambition.  This film is just lazy.  It doesn't go anywhere, and the stale performances he drew out of the two leads only serves to water down the emotional impact a film like this should carry.<br /><br />But alas, there is always Gyllenhaal and her BRILLIANT performance as the emotionally conflicted wife of Pena's character to help ease the pain of this poorly constructed drama.  The way she embraced her character's struggle without ever once playing to the clich&eacute;s surrounding her `stock character' is completely commendable.  Every moment feels very, very real (from her gut wrenching agony to the playful way she teases her husband).<br /><br />In the end, my friend, I urge you to take a second look at this film as well as `United 93' (I know, it's painful) and reconsider your rankings.  Taste is taste, and I'm not here to belittle yours, but we are supposed to be twins and so you kind of have to agree with me!</p></br><a href="../users/A3NH7PYU4AD5GA.html">A3NH7PYU4AD5GA</a><br/><p>I remember Sep 11 like this: I was visiting in Shanghai, came to my hotel room in the evening, not so late, turned on CNN as usual, and saw a plane fly into one of the towers. It took me quite some time to understand what I had just seen. I called my wife and asked her to turn on TV at home. She had not heard yet.<br />I never felt more American than on that day.<br />I am German, by the way.<br />When I heard that Oliver Stone was making a movie about this, I could not believe it. Too early, too monumental, too emotionally loaded, too ideologically simple. This could only become a bad film.<br />It hasn't. It is a simple story about confusion and heroism and survival. Well done.<br />You never see a plane fly into anything. You only hear people talk about it, but there are also some who don't believe it. It shows you the segmented vision of people who are near the center. People watching TV in Shanghai probably knew more of what actually happened right at the time than those caught in the middle of it.<br />Stone stays away from explicit interpretation, he leaves that to the spectator.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Nicholas Cage and Michael Pena star as two New York City Port Authority police officers in this magnificent film by Oliver Stone which describes one of the darkest days in the history of the United States: September 11, 2001.<br /><br />Cage stars as Sgt. John McLoughlin, and Pena stars as officer Will Jimeno.  These two men, along with a crew of other officers, entered into the stricken World Trade Center shortly after the brutal terrorist attacks.  Their job was to go up inside the tower and assist with rescue efforts.  However, shortly after entering the buildings, the collapse began.  The officers immediately dove for an elevator shaft; supposedly one of the strongest places in the building.  Despite their quick thinking, McLoughlin, Jimeno, and the rest of the officers are buried under tons of concrete and debris.  McLoughlin and Jimeno are the only survivors.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Jimeno's wife Allison (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is 5 months' pregnant with a new baby daughter, and McLoughlin's wife Donna (Maria Bello) is busy making plans for her son J.J.'s birthday party.  Both see the terrorist attacks on television and immediately fear for their husbands' safety.  The two families begin a consant vigil while waiting to hear any news about the well-being of their husbands.<br /><br />While buried in the rubble, Jimeno and McLoughlin try to do anything they can to stay awake and keep each other alive.  Fearing internal injuries, neither man wants to fall asleep.  They keep each other awake by talking about their families and their lives as police officers.  A deep bond forms between the two, and neither wants to be rescued without the other.<br /><br />Efforts to find survivors have begun, spearheaded by members of the United States Marines, along with the New York City Fire and Police Department.  One member of the Marine unit is Sgt. Dave Karnes (Michael Shannon).  A former member of the Marines, Karnes has left his regular accounting job to come to New York to assist with rescue efforts.  He, along with another rescuer, hears Jimeno banging on a pipe.  Soon, Karnes has located the two fallen officers, and reinforcements are called in to get them out.  The two men are soon pulled to safety and taken to a local hospital.<br /><br />Only twenty survivors were pulled from the wreckage of the World Trade Center.  McLoughlin and Jimeno endured more than most people possibly could, and they survived to tell about it.  Both endured several surgeries on their road to recovery, but something more came out of this ordeal; a life-long bond and friendship between two officers who were merely doing their jobs.<br /><br />This is a truly moving and magnificent film.  Nicholas Cage gives one of the finest performances of his career as Sgt. McLoughlin, while Michael Pena is excellent as officer Jimeno.  Oliver Stone's directing is first-rate, and he tells the story of 9-11 in a factual, yet sensitive and tasteful manner.<br /><br />I give this tremendous film my highest recommendation.  Watch and see how two heroic police officers risked their own lives to save the lives of strangers and ended up surviving their own personal hardships.  If you have a dry eye after watching this movie, then something's wrong.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>That 20 people would survive the collapse of the World Trade Towers and be pulled out alive from under those tons of debris.  That a former Marine would, on-his-own, feel compelled to take himself to ground zero to search for survivors among the smoldering, still-dangerous, ruins that night.  That two first-responders, Port Authority Policeman, would be found by that same Marine (and another self-appointed volunteer) as their survival was nearing failure. That Oliver Stone would make a movie about these two policeman, their ordeal and that of their families, as a microcosm of the terror and tragedy of that day, and do so with reverence and respect.  That his film would be a testament to virtues some of us still prize, those of courage and honor and duty--not only that of John McLoughlin and Willy Jimeno, the trapped policeman, but also of those who dared to go into that burning, unstable and perilous wreckage to bring them out.<br /><br />This film celebrates those simple virtues-courage, honor, duty, family- and I think Oliver Stone believes them important enough that he set aside political opinion to present them in a straightforward manner.  If you believe this is only the stuff of cheap Hollywood theatrics, well, that's sad. Real guts were plentiful on that day and those following, and I believe that was honestly portrayed here in focusing on the miraculous true story of these two men.<br /><br />All the performances are heartfelt and equally good.  I was not bored.  I knew going in that this was a story of survival, but the details were gripping and unbelievable nontheless.  I thought Stone and his production caught the immensity of ground zero in deft touches: the roar of the burning buildings amid the falling debris, the ghastly sound of the impact of bodies, the simple enormity of the structures and the dust and confusion, the look of shocked and stunned people everywhere. It gave a sense of the size of the disaster.  The following story would be difficult to tell, with two of the main leads immoblized in a crushed building, but I thought the editing back and forth from the men to the families worked.<br /><br />Credit to all involved, this was a film I thought I might not like, but I went with it all the way. Nicely done by Stone and company.  And all respect and good wishes to the real men and their families, and to all those who served that day, and serve now.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"World Trade Center" is brilliant!

This is a film to remember on Oscar night.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>When most movie-goers think of Oliver Stone, they usually think of cutting edge (Born on the Fourth of July), or visceral film-making (Natural Born Killers), or even historically disturbing cinema (The Doors). But few -- if any -- would consider Stone schmaltzy or an opportunist. Watching WORLD TRADE CENTER, though, one can't help but feel a touch of the latter and a significant amount of the former.<br /><br />UNITED 93 was similar in that it took the recent horrific events of 9/11 and reintroduced Americans' fears to that awful day. It utilized (for better or worse) those feelings we all have and made money off of it. This isn't as terrible as it sounds, though. Cinema has been doing this for as long as celluloid has been running through projectors, but never has the filming been so close to the actual date of the events (or at least rarely).<br /><br />One can't help but think that Stone must've been desperate for film material or somehow felt closely connected to the events that day. Either way, the script (although based on actual events) was lackluster at best. There are just a few exceptions that we'll cover in a moment.<br /><br />This is the (true) story of the port authority police officers that responded to the World Trade Center attacks on 9/11, and is specific to the two men from the port authority who were trapped and later rescued from under the rubble. Nicholas Cage (National Treasure) stars as John McLoughlin, a gruff Sergeant who was around during the first bombings on the trade centers several years earlier. His entrapped fellow officer is rookie Will Jimeno played by Michael Pena (Crash), a family man with a new baby on the way. Both men have to deal with their isolation and near certain demise as they lay pinned and stranded only a few feet from one another. The story jumps between the rubble strewn men, their wives and families, and a retired marine who feels the call of duty after the attacks and risks his life to find survivors in the buildings' wreckage (the schmaltzy portions are firmly entrenched here as we're spoonfed everyone's tearful response to that terrible day).<br /><br />It is this "marine" that most might have the biggest trouble with script-wise. He seemed almost inserted into the story to give some grist to an otherwise empty milieu. His need for "revenge" felt hollow amidst so much emotion. And although this may be "the way it was," it didn't translate well to film.<br /><br />Interestingly, Nicholas Cage gives an admirable performance even though he's not jumping into and out of danger, or battling evil-doers with deadly weapons. He's confined as is co-star Pena and their concern for one another is touching, as is their concern for what will happen to their families as they lay thinking/dreaming about them (these were some of the best parts of the screenplay but only a small portion of the whole).<br /><br />The most powerful part of the film was its sound editing. When the buildings collapsed and then later continued to creak and groan, they took on an ominous characteristic that brooded poorly for our two main characters and gave movie-watchers a great sense of dread.<br /><br />But when the sound becomes the most impressive part of a film, there's more problems than applause.</p></br><a href="../users/ACVFTS9X2MKJ8.html">ACVFTS9X2MKJ8</a><br/><p>I can't believe this movie actually went straight to the theatre. This movie is not even worthy of typical prime-time television. Even if I lost a loved one who was portrayed in this film, I'd still be bored to tears of how it's being such an empty, long-winded, story, only focused on mainly just two people. "Oh, help me, help me, I'm trapped." "We're doing what we can, we love you, we love you!" Oh brother! Jeez, that's some really creative writing, huh? This film was so unnecessary. We've all already imagined all the horrifying aspects of the tragedy. There's nothing new here.<br /><br />Think about it. If this event never really happened, but they made a film like this anyway. You'd have to agree that this movie is quite boring. Just a bunch of tear-shedding dialogue. This could have easily been just a low cost television show.<br /><br />Now "United 93" was definately more of a detailed story. It was much better done, and more "on the edge of your seat" entertaining. Yes, I said "entertaining!". Why do YOU go to see a movie? Because you wanna go and cry about something?  I found studying Algebra more entertaining than this long-winded yawner of a just an exchange of tearful woes and prayers.<br /><br />And what's more, why would anyone want to own this movie? To see a miserable situation played out over and over. Just like "The Passion of Christ" too. Who would actually want to watch that movie over and over just to see Jesus Christ beatened? I'm sure we all thank Jesus for suffering for our sins, but I wouldn't want to watch a movie that shows me that he's suffering for me.<br /><br />And all this "9-11" hype. C'mon, this is something of the past. We need to let it go and get on with our lives. I'm so tired of being reminded that it happened. Trying to keep this sad tragedy imbedded in our minds can not be psychologically healthy. There is no benefit in mentally sustaining an irreversable tragedy of a "done deal" event. Why give Al-Queda the pleasure of seeing us continuing to suffer from that one event? Their hearts are laughing everyday, everytime we voice our pain about that tragic day.  The more we keep showing our pain and fear of their existance, the more they'll continue enjoying the small victory of their terrorist act.<br /><br />Well anyway, there's a ball game on tonight! That's all that matters right now! Let's just focus on that and get on with our lives in a positive way.<br /><br />So, I'm sure everyone thinks that I am cold and insensitive. However, that's not true at all. Hollywood sees "9-11" as a guaranteed money maker.  Creating movies to continue to provoke everyone's fears about that day is a cold and insensitive approach to profitable commercialism.  Making money out of making movies like this is no more in "bad taste" than someone selling "I survived 9-11" T-shirts.<br /><br />Hey, now there's an idea!

The movie shows flashbacks of the men and their families and also shows the agony their wives are going through as they wait for word of their husbands.  The script never properly develops the two main characters in the viewer's mind and this detracts from the overall emotional impact which the movie could have had.

Released a few months after the harrowing, depressing "United 93" this film also tells the story of normal, everyday people trapped in horrific circumstances with heroic outcomes. Although the outcome of this film is admittedly better than that of "United 93." The film is directed by Oliver Stone, a director who is no stranger to controversy. When I heard he was doing a film on the subject of 9/11, I expected a film in the vein of "JFK" or "Nixon"<br /><br />or "The Doors." True stories, with his own theories and versions of events. Watching "World Trade Center" there is little evidence to suggest that this is an Oliver Stone film. The directing style is different, the storytelling is different. Only one scene seems like something out of an Oliver Stone film (Jesus with a water bottle) and I read that Will Jimeno actually saw that. The movie starts at 3:29 A.M. in New York, as Port Authority officer John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) wakes up to head to work. Stone does a great job of underlining how normal the day was for New Yorkers before the first plane hit the first tower. The imagery of the plane's shadow and the smoke from the towers is very haunting and very realistic. Knowing what we now know, it's interesting hearing the characters trying to figure out what's going on. Anyway, after the second plane has hit the second tower (although most people weren't yet aware of that), McLoughlin and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena from "Crash" who deserves an Oscar nomination for his work here), along with others, rush into the WTC to help the people still inside. Barely inside the towers collapse, leaving McLoughlin and Jimeno trapped under 20 feet of rubble. The two men trapped under the rubble, trying desperately to keep their minds off death is intercut with the lives of their wives. Donna McLoughlin (Maria Bello, who also deserves an Oscar nomination) fights desperately against the fact that her husband might be dead, while trying to convince her children that, without a doubt, their father is still alive. Meanwhile Allison Jimeno (Maggie Gyllenhaal, who also deserves an Oscar nomination), who is pregnant with the couples second child, deals with the fact that her husband might not be coming home. Out of the two female leads, Bello is the best. Wearing blue contact lenses to make her character more realistic, she blends just the right amount of integrity, bravery, and attitude to make this one of the best performances of the year. One other subplot involves a former U.S. Marine named Dave Karnes (Michael Shannon), a man who leaves his job and goes searching for survivors in the rubble. While "United 93" used harsh realism and left you feeling depressed, "World Trade Center" uses harsh realism and makes you feel uplifted. A film about people trapped in places can feel disjointed, as if the screenwriter lost his way and made excuses to get his script into the 120-page range (this can be seen in a film called "Hard Candy," which is good but has what I just mentioned). This film has the feel of a movie that knew exactly what direction it's taking from the beginning. "World Trade Center" is an important film, a great film, and a massive improvement over Stone's last film "Alexander." It's got great cinematography, great performances, and is, without a doubt, one of the best films of the year.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></br><a href="../users/ACMAUJEBY6GJF.html">ACMAUJEBY6GJF</a><br/><p>..., but not necassarily because Oliver Stone has done a bad job here. In my opinion of all the tragedies and events behind the WTC the one we are served here is being less about the WTC. Please, don't get me wrong. This is also something that deserves being told, the story of those who survived in the ruins, but it was like watching a movie start out with the ending. I spend the first hour of the movie feeling confused. Not because I wanted to see the explotions, great effects. But I wanted a story. To be showed something I hadn't already seen. to be led through that horrible day minute by minute. I have seen documentaries on the Discovery-channel more gripping than "World Trade Center". Though perhaps it has its' moments at the end, but with a less brilliant director the movie might had been overflowed in sentimentality.<br /><br />I recommend "United 91" instead of this. So much more realistic, and answered so many questions. And gave such an believable version of what happened on that plane.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>On September, 11th 2001, after the terrorist attack to the World Trade Center, the building collapses over the rescue team from the Port Authority Police Department. Will Jimeno and his sergeant John McLoughlin are found alive trapped under the wreckage while the rescue teams fight to save them. It is a powerful movie that tells the story without sensationalizing the event and the anger and hatred for the attackers following the attacks. There are tears of joy, laughs, and tears of sorrow interlaced throughout this movie with Strong acting from a huge cast including Nicolas Cage and Michael Pena. This movie is not ground-breaking work, but it wasn't meant to be. It was meant to tell the story of a few brave men and their families and their experiences during September 11th, and it accomplished this very well.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1EDCBV2KU8D.html">A3Q1EDCBV2KU8D</a><br/><p>This isn't a movie about why or how as much as it is a movie of the 18th and 19th survivors pulled from the wreckage.  Oliver Stone did an excellent job of showing how this fateful day effected two Port Authority Officers and their families with such intensity that my wife had to take a break, it was really a lot to take in.  The movie was well done, the actors were on top of their game, even in a difficult situation that they were given.</p></br><a href="../users/A5A2QE6NECFR5.html">A5A2QE6NECFR5</a><br/><p>This, along with United 93, was one of the two best movies I saw last year, and I am picky and do not get to see all that many. Nick Cage is good, but his co-star steals the show. As with the United 93 film, the protagonists do not know what caused the day's tragic events, what was happening elsewhere, or whether their precarious situations would have any wider meaning than just to themselves and their loved ones. Oliver Stone turns in a restrained, non-conspiracy, non-paranoid, non-obscene, and oddly, a nearly non-violent work of art here. A lot of it is filmed in the dark, with only the heads and maybe one hand visible on each actor, and with dialogue hampered by their injuries and desperate situation. Yet it is quite powerful, and to me, a total success.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>I live just a little over a mile from where the World Trade Center used to be, and I'll never forget that day five years ago, when the world watched its destruction.  There's finally some new construction going on in the area now and I could actually see it from the window of the theater where I chose to view this film.  It was a welcome contrast to the horror depicted on the screen, and the horror all of us lived with daily during that time.  I consider myself lucky that none of my loved ones were in those buildings that day.  Other fellow New Yorkers were not as fortunate.<br /><br />Of course I knew the plot of this Oliver Stone film.  I knew that the two Port Authority police officers who were trapped in the rubble were eventually rescued.  Later, we were reminded that only 20 people were rescued alive from the rubble.  I should have remembered that because I, like many others, volunteered to give blood.  We were all turned away though.  There were not enough survivors who could use it.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage and Michael Pena are cast as the two cops.  Maria Bello and Maggie Gyllenhaal are their wives.  The acting was excellent and they all must have had a great dialogue coach because their New York accents sounded authentic.  During much of the film, we feel the claustrophobia of being trapped along with the men.  They are pinned under debris, terribly hurt, and yet they keep themselves alive by talking to each other.  There are also some flashbacks about their families as well as a current running timeline as their families learn of the disaster and wait for news.  The film captures the time and the place perfectly.  I was a bit unprepared by my own emotional reaction to the film though; I found myself weeping during much of it, not only for the two men trapped inside the buildings, but weeping for the disappointment of the last five years.  Even though life here has returned to normal, our world has become a much more dangerous place.<br /><br />After viewing film I walked around the area.  It's bustling and beautiful.  The World Financial Center has been restored to its former splendor and the riverfront is full of joggers and bicyclists.  There's a trapeze school and a batting range and attractive landscaping throughout the area.  And there's new construction which promises even more attractive piers and walkways.  Whenever I'm down in that area though, the one thing that always dominates my consciousness is the Statue of Liberty off in the distance.  It's still there.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>On September 11th, 2001 the world changed forever.  For Americans, things changed the most.  There are hundreds of millions of stories about that day that could be told.  WORLD TRADE CENTER is a film that attempts to tell the story of that day seen through the eyes of two Port Authorities who became trapped in the rubble beneath the World Trade Center and who were eventually rescued.  The two men the movie revolves around, John McLoughlin (Nicholas Cage) and William J. Jimeno (Michael Pena), had entered the World Trade Center to assist firefighters and other law enforcement in evacuating the buildings.  As things turned out it became they who needed to be rescued as the buildings came crashing down.  The story of their survival and rescue is just a glimpse of the heroism showed by countless Americans that was displayed on September 11th and in the aftermath.<br /><br />WORLD TRADE CENTER is probably Oliver Stone's most approachable and least controversial film ever.  The film has broad appeal, not only to those who lived and worked in New York City, but across America.  As alluded to before, every one of us has a story about September 11th.  The film just focuses on two men, but by doing so it becomes universal:  the story of John McLoughlin and William J. Jimeno are all our stories.  We might not have all been physically present in NYC when the towers fell, but we watched it on television.  That was a day that there were no divisions in this country.  Strangers willingly helped strangers and at least for once in a generation, we were all simply Americans.  WORLD TRADE CENTER depicts this and it does so it a non-patronizing, yet honorable way.<br /><br />I was a bit leery about watching WORLD TRADE CENTER.  Granted, Oliver Stone is a gifted filmmaker.  However, most of Stone's films are extreme.  In general the Stone canon is comprised of films that offer a bleak and despairing view of people and life.  Often his movies are quite violent, crude, and vulgar.  He is able to craft together a decent story from the most unusual sources and he has a master command of camera technique and cinematography.  However, the nihilistic tone of many of Stone's previous works made me reluctant to watch.  After my family and some friends had seen the film and recommended it, I was willing to give it a try.  I'm glad that I did.  Whatever messages Stone has tried to convey in previous films and films yet to come, WORLD TRADE CENTER Stone reminds us that we are all Americans, even himself, and that even in a messed up crazy world hope still remains.</p></br><a href="../users/AAU7CAQIN5BAE.html">AAU7CAQIN5BAE</a><br/><p>The film overall lacked ingenuity. People can say "oh how can you say that about what happened." IM NOT. I'm saying THE MOVIE Sucked. Sorry for the street word, but that is exactly how to describe it. Right from the beginning when the cops were being hauled from PA to downtown, there was no emotional creativity. The cut scenes were paltry and boring. SHOW THE TERROR Stone, don't candy coat it all mamsy-pamsey for the masses. What a sell out. Pathetic. A cut scene with a guy with a little soot on his double breast or another with a bleeding ear is really not well done. Let's see the horror. It was dull, boring and I don't know how The Academy or anyone rational can think Nick Cage is anything less than wooden and plastic in every Role he is in. He lacks any emotional creativity in all forms. It was not the Oliver Stone I expected and admired from Wall Street and Platoon. United 93 blew this film away in every aspect. In every way. WTC was Hollywood from jumpstreet. It was like a pre packaged deal at Walmart this film. What a total piece of garbage. I understand he is showing it from a different aspect entirely, but one wonders why it bombed in the box office and you can often get it here for 67 cents. There is a reason. It was awful, and it could have been phenomenal. What a shame.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>Nicolas Cage's performance in this movie is outstanding. this is truly an awesome film. this is a must see</p></br><a href="../users/A327YZ9EDPHDOQ.html">A327YZ9EDPHDOQ</a><br/><p>Oliver Stone's 'World Trade Center" grabs your attention from start to finish. The movie depicted the most horrendous day in this country's history. The heroes in this movie are the officers who courageously survived the rubble and how their families coped through it all. I will admit this movie is emotional and quite powerful. We will never forget 9/11. I know I won't forget it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />A much different film than many people feared it would be when they heard Oliver Stone was attached, World Trade Center is not great in scope or ambition but in telling the small story of John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno it is an unqualified success; 25 years from now when there have been many more films made about 9/11 this one may not be well-remembered, but it achieves what it sets out to do.<br /><br />3/4</p></br><a href="../users/A2CZPM110DW516.html">A2CZPM110DW516</a><br/><p>With the release of Oliver Stone's much anticipated "World Trade Center," the controversial director received just as much criticism as praise for his study of two of the heroes of 9/11. Those who share Stone's ardent leftist beliefs thought he should have made a film questioning the government's role in the events of that day. I'll be first in line when that movie gets made (don't count on it), but "World Trade Center" is excellent for what it is: a tale of heroism and determination in the face of overwhelming odds.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage is superb as John McLaughlin, the port authority police sergeant who is buried, along with colleague Will Jimeno (Michael Pena), in the rubble of the Twin Towers while his family patiently awaits news of his condition.<br /><br />"World Trade Center" is a compelling survival story, vastly superior to "United 93," the other 9/11 film from 2006 which received praise all out of balance with its actual merits.<br /><br />Brian W. Fairbanks</p></br><a href="../users/A359IT81FBX64Y.html">A359IT81FBX64Y</a><br/><p>I'm not an Oliver Stone fan, but I have to give him credit for this film. The terrorist attack on 9/11 is the background, but this story transcends that and becomes a universal story of large-scale tragedy and individual courage and survival. There is nothing gratuitous or overdone in this film, and it somehow manages to be both sensitive and direct.<br /><br />However, there is one point I am confused about, and perhaps another reviewer can clear it up. When the first tower collapses and the port authority police team are trapped under the rubble, there is a roll call. It seems to me that four or five men call out their names, but shortly after we only see three men, with no clue as to what happened to the others, and the story continues from there.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>Released by Paramount, August 9, 2006.<br />  Director Oliver Stone was very careful not to film the horrible scenes of September 11, 2001 we have already seen many times on the news.  You will not see any scenes of the crashes, not the impact which is already subliminally in our mind.  Stone shows only a shadow of a plane and then a sound effect followed by people's reaction.Their is nothing offensive in this film.  The action and hydrinoline is quite toned down.  Their is no mention of the Middle East or the politics in this film.<br />  The movie mostly focuses on two New York City Port Authority policemen played by Nicholas Cage and Michael Pena pinned under the rubble.<br />  The real-life policemen and survivors John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno make a cameo appearance. Will Jimeno is seen several times in the film. He iss the Port Authority Officier who says "Sarg" as Nicholas cage runs towards the group with papers flying outside, and is seen hugging actor, Michael Pena at end of film. Nicholas Cage shakes hands with John McLoughlin.<br />  For those who care, this film might make a lump in your throat. The scenes of the men down in the rubble really put you there.<br />  Some people have become cynical, but their are many stories that could be told here about 9/11.  This story has a good ending.<br />  Only 20 people were found alive in the World Trade Center Towers rubble.<br />  Also in the cast: Jay Hernandez as "Dominick Pezzulo", Danny Nucci as "Officier Giraldi", Stoney Westmoreland as "Paddy McGee".

I think that Stone does well in helping us begin to visualize the enormity of Ground Zero.  And this work helps us picture the underground structures in which these two men (and others) were trapped. Additionally, it bravely reveals the miscommunications which caused anguish for hopeful family-members. While some criticize this film for not underscoring the danger posed to the rescuers, I thought Stone did his best . . . as the rescuers/EMTs attempt to crawl to the officers, they are warned that they may die. Over and over, this is emphasized. So, for me, I think the rescuers bravery was well-portrayed.<br /><br />Cage does a phenomenal job with his role as John McLoughlin: he is entirely believable . . . to the point where my companion and I even forgot it WAS Cage. Likewise for Michael Pena. Maggie Gyllenhaal also did a wonderful job at portraying Allison Jimeno: she played the role with quiet grace, thus allowing the emphasis to remain with the men trapped at Ground Zero. Now, that's great acting AND great directing!!<br /><br />There was one seemingly minor problem which became more and more problematic as the film progressed. I know it sounds weird, but Maria Bello was either made to wear OR chose to wear bright-blue contact-lens in her role as Donna McLoughlin. Now, I had never seen this actress in film before and did not know she had dark brown eyes . . . but I DID notice the sloppy contacts and later investigated this on IMDB. The actresses dark brown eyes were not well concealed by these lens and it translated REALLY badly to film. Why does this matter, right?! It matters because every SINGLE time you see THESE HORRIBLE contacts, and BELIEVE ME you cannot miss it, you are reminded that this is a film . . . instead of remaining engaged in the film. From a technical perspective, it disrupts the audience's experience . . . and it a disservice to viewers to be pulled-out of such an important film. But, this is an annoyance which does not negate the overall value of this work!<br /><br />This is a good film which is worth the watch. Moreover, it relieves anxiety that audience members KNOW they are watching a film where the featured police officers are rescued. For many, it is too early to watch a broader film . . . so this depiction of one "small" triumph is just what many need. And this film delivers that hope while STILL ACKNOWLEDGING the tremendous loss.<br /><br />In sum, it is respectful and well-rendered.</p></br><a href="../users/AMYW43AHO16SS.html">AMYW43AHO16SS</a><br/><p>When Oliver Stone makes movies of historical value, he tends to exagerate the facts (i.e. JFK, Salvador, Midnight Express).  In this film, he completely stays out of delivering negative propaganda on who was responsible and focuses on the ordeal and rescue of Port Authority policemen John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pe&ntilde;a).  The result is a movie that all viewers would be proud of.  The film was made with courage and sympathy to the victims.  Some viewers may be put off by the intensity of the subject matter, due to the film being too soon to watch.  This film is very much needed in this day and age in hopes that the events of September 11th, 2001 are never forgotten.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>This was probably one of the toughest movies I've had to review. There are tremendous emotions portrayed here and without question will bring tears to your eyes. It isn't a 5 star movie, and it isn't a 2 star movie. I mean, you could give it 4 stars out of sympathy and respect for the people portrayed in the film, and that would be the only reason I would give it 4 stars.<br /><br />The movie is about 2 port authority officers who were pulled from the rubble after 9/11, their families & their ordeal. It doesn't cover the whole event like you might think. In the film, it's interesting to see how they found themselves under the rubble and how they kept themselves alive. It's interesting to see the world from their vantage point, yards beneath the piles of medal and concrete.<br /><br />So, where does WORLD TRADE CENTER fall short for me?<br /><br />It may be unfair to compare, but I watched UNITED 93 about a week before and it was by far, a superior film. After watching UNITED 93, and seeing the mostly unknown actors knock it out of the park, I was taken by the OUTSTANDING realism and the attention to detail. When you looked at the actors portraying the real life victims in the film, you saw the real life victims, not the actors. The anonimity of the unknown actors brought a sense of realism to the project.<br /><br />That brings me to WORLD TRADE CENTER. As the movie began to unfold, I caught myself thinking like this.... "Hey, that's Maria Bello. She was in HISTORY OF VIOLENCE. She was hot in COYOTE UGLY. There's Nicholas Cage. Jesus, is he in everything? I wonder when GHOST RIDER is coming out? Who's that guy... oh, yeah, he was in CRASH and MILLION DOLLAR BABY. Oh, yeah, and that's the guy from CRAZY/BEAUTIFUL. Man, there's a lot of stars in this. That's the kid from TITANIC, Leo's friend, Danny Nucci. Ooh, that's Maggie Gyllenhaal. I like her. SECRETARY was good. Her brothers Jake. Oh yeah. That's Stephen Dorff... where's he been? Oh, wow, is that Frank Whaley? Man, where's he been. I remember him from like CAREER OPPORTUNITES. Ooh, wasn't he the guy that gave Sam Jackson his big gulp in PULP FICTION? That's the guy from LOST. The other who posed as a crash victim."<br /><br />To put this point into a shorter prose: the recognizable actors throughout the film were a COMPLETE DISTRACTION. Watching these actors ACT was distracting. It came across too Hollywood to me. The watching through a time window effect that was so amazingly captured by UNITED 93 was NOT at all captured by WORLD TRADE CENTER. It came across like actors portraying someone.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage, one of the most recognizeable stars today, played real life port authority officer John McLoughlin, and it felt like a Hollywood movie and that to me, doomed it. WORLD TRADE CENTER deserved better. When you're looking at these REAL personalities, like McLoughlin & Will Jimeno, you don't want to see big hollywood star Nicholas Cage & the guy from Crash, you want to see the men they're portraying.<br /><br />I don't want to be too harsh on the film. It is a good film, and as much as I hate to say it, I wanted to be brought back to that day. I wanted to be reminded of what happened, like we all should every year, so we never forget why and who did this. I was reminded, but the constant bombardment of recognizable actors kept me from completely being sucked into the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Oliver Stone, known for his wild conspiracy-laden film JFK, the ultra-violent Natural Born Killers or Vietnam centered Platoon, directs this film and unless you took off the credits and everything, you probably couldn't tell he did this. No shift from color to black and white, no hyper camera or politics. So don't think this film is meant to be a big rant against terrorists, or even America for its politics or, I must admit they show sometimes, their arrogance. Instead what we get is just simply a first-hand account of 2 caught in the rubble, as well as the families that were on pins and needles waiting by a phone.<br /><br />September 11, 2001, a day like any other like the opening scenes show us. 2 cops, John McCoughlin and Will Jimenez go to work only to hear of a plane hitting one of the towers at the World Trade Center. In they go, as well as other officers, to rescue those trapped in the buildings until both towers collapse. Miraculously they survive but are trapped and severely injured. We follow both men struggling to live out of sight and unable to move. We also switch to their wives, John's wife Donna and Will's wife Allison as they wait impatiently for news on their husbands.<br /><br />One commonly asked question at the time, and even a song title by Alan Jackson, was "where were you?" Me, I was in Math class until I had a spare at 10:30 that took me right to lunch. As I was walking to the stairway to go downstairs and out the door, I heard one student say they "bombed the Pentagon" but I thought crazy kids always talking about movie plots or just being weird. It wasn't until I looked on a website at home that it was the top story. Turned on the TV and there it was. One thing I hated was the TV coverage. Seeing each plane slam into one of the towers every 7 seconds from different angles was a bit much: over 100 lives on each plane not to mention those in the vicinity of where they hit gone in a few seconds. Then of course we have the collapse which they replayed again. Thankfully this film doesn't show them from a filmmaking perspective, putting them on news report or sounds. Oddly the highlight even though it sounds morbid is when they towers collapse with the officers inside: it's incredibly harrowing and powerful really even if it doesn't last as long as I would like. The film suffers from a Catch-22 though: switching back and forth from the families to the 2 officers is a bit jarring even though both would work fine on their own. Seeing 2 cops who can't move talk to each other for an hour and a half would've been kind of boring but when they switch, it's like "hey put it back!"<br /><br />One thing that happened a lot before the film came out was people asking whether it was too soon to make this. Oddly, this is the 4th film I can recall about 9/11 specifically: Flight 93, United 93, the Great New Wonderful and this film. It doesn't really feel early for me. Instead it feels like a film that was doomed by the public before it even premiered(didn't help that star Maggie Gylennhaal made a comment about America and 9/11 that America was in a way responsible. This of course was highly offensive to them, especially New Yorkers but it does feel like what the film's reaction was too: mention 9/11 and a shield is set up, preventing anyone from talking about it in any way. Stone manages to for once be non-political and presents a simple straight-forward story.<br /><br />Recently I bought the extended edition of King Kong, the third release to feature extensive background info on the making of the film, the other 2 being the original 2-disc as well as the Production Diaries set. While the film was rather lackluster, the amount of attention paid to the making-of suggests that they obviously loved making the film, just to bad the finished product wasn't as well as it should've been. Same thing with the Some Kind of Monster documentary, chronicling Metallica's recording of the much-maligned St. Anger album. It's not that World Trade Center is bad, far from it, but what this film could've been and seeing the special features makes it clear this film could've been incredibly moving.<br /><br />It's a film that I admire but I find it hard to love. That said, this is not a cinema blemish and it's at times a very effective film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>World Trade Center directed by Oliver Stone showed promise in the first 30 minutes but after that, this film lacked a heart and soul. The all-star cast are expectionally talented but the true-life survivors they are portraying seem so fake and unsympathetic. Oliver Stone was such a great director but his "masterpieces" have suffered greatly in over a decade, I can't remember a flawless film he's created in such a long time, it's so sad. If you want a film that is truly a tribute to the courageous heroes of 9/11 then I highly recommend United 93 instead. That film is perfect from beginning to end.</p></br><a href="../users/A13OMT8D4GPIBV.html">A13OMT8D4GPIBV</a><br/><p>This is a very well put together film.

When JFK was shot. When man landed on the moon. (I still say you see strings.) When John Lennon was murdered. (So far, too young for all of these.) When Princess Diana was killed (having a sleepover with my ex-best friend.) When September 11th happened - I was on holiday in the UK at the time. My now boyfriend had come home early from college, as he wasn't feeling great. I remember walking back to our caravan (how quaint) and someone in a neighbouring caravan telling us to switch on the news. We sat and watched the news unfold, and I still have a diary somewhere which I wrote in everything we were getting told, and how I was feeling. For some reason, I was worrying my friends back home in Scotland, even though we were still many miles away from New York.<br /><br />Flight 93, United 93 and World Trade Center all seemed to come about at the same time. I'm still not sure why. To make films of other people's suffering. But they're out there now, we can't stop them, all we can do is try and put ourselves in their place.<br /><br />World Trade Center is very well acted, with a brilliant cast consisting of Nicholas Cage (with a very bad moustache), Maria Bello, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jay Hernandez, Stephen Dorff and Michael Pe&ntilde;a. It's so well acted in fact you actually forget you're watching a film. I was holding my breath during some points in the film, and was nearly in tears at other points. Watching re-runs of the original news footage, was quite emotional. I do agree with some reviewers, that it did focus a bit too much on the two police officers stuck in the rubble - I had it in my head it was actually going to be them IN the World Trade Center, not stuck underneath the rubble. But it was brilliantly acted by Nicholas & Michael, it must have been so claustrophobic during those scenes and flat on their backs, amongst the 240 tons of material that was used to recreate a fully 3-dimensional Ground Zero in Los Angeles.<br /><br />The film spares the feelings for the people that were actually there, by not using footage of the planes actually striking the Twin Towers. We're shown how little the officers knew at the time, as they prepared to evacuate North Tower, they had no idea South Tower had even been hit.<br /><br />Maggie Gyllenhaal and Maria Bello play the worried wives back home, anxiously waiting for news. Maria's character has four children with Nicholas's character, and Maggie is 5 months pregnant with their second child.<br /><br />After everything that has happened since 2001, a pointless war in Iraq which has done nothing but let even more people grieve, and attacks in London, it seems nothing can be done, unless the Americans come together and get a new President. As recently as a couple of weeks ago in 2007, Tony Blair finally stepped down as Prime Minister in the UK, and Bush should follow.<br /><br />I don't think any more films should be made about 9/11. 2,700+ people were lost that day, and with a mere three films out there retelling the story, it can't be pleasant for any Americans. Let them grieve Hollywood.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>This is a very hard film to review as one can misinterpret a negative comment as a smear on the memory of those who died and survived 9/11.  This film does have its flaws and weaknesses, but more importantly this film celebrates the American spirit in our ability to overcome great trials and tribulations, to find greatness in tragedy, strength in our weakest moment, and hope in our dispair.  This is Oliver Stone's most human and relatable work yet.  The images are haunting and memorable and our tragedy is relived here with compassion, dignity, and great reverance.  Stone seemed to recognize that this could not be another vanity film for him as this film isn't about him.<br /><br />The acting is first rate by all the principal players.  The cast is filled with many familiar faces from television and film.  The script is intelligently written and very believable.  The score is appropriately haunting and uplifting all at once.  The photography and effects are done with great care and class.  We never see the towesr get hit by the planes which I'm sure was a very tempting special effect to include, but wisely avoided.  Instead we get the shadow of the plane on the buildings around the towers and outstanding sound effects that make you feel like you are actually there hearing the planes hit.  The sound effects reminded me very much of that 70's disaster flick "Earthquake" that was filmed in something called sensurround sound.  In addition, the action is slowed down and all other sounds are muted during the impact moments.<br /><br />Stone also wisely includes the terrible moments of people jumping from the towers, but in a very limited fashion.  We only see one person fall, but throughout the early scenes we hear the horrible sounds of bodies hitting the pavement, but never see the impacts.  Again, another wise decision by Stone (but, damn, if those sounds don't linger in your head long after the film is over).  One's heart can't help but be touched by the hopelessness those felt in the upper floors of the towers.  Much praise goes to Stone for carefully and respectfully selecting what we see and hear in this film.  He wisely realized that the impact of that day can be felt without actually being seen.  We don't even see the towers collapse and we don't need to.  The sounds goes right through you when you see this film.  It truely is and experience to watch this film.  A sound-effects editing Oscar would be well-earned by this film.<br /><br />The film also realistically captures the chaos and confusion on that fateful day when we just didn't know what was happening.  The various miscommunications are believable and heartwrenching and, I think, bring about a better understanding of what our heroes were faced with that day.<br /><br />The downside of this film is it's length.  It is 2 hours and 10 minutes long and it could have easily been edited down to about 1:40 minutes or so.  There are just too many repeated shots (the trapped men looking up at the light) and long shots of nothing happening.  I'm sure that Stone wanted us to feel trapped with these men and experience in some way their hopeless situation and feeling of confinement, but it does get to be tedious at times and you want to simply fast forward the film.  There is also the endless dialogue of "we're gonna make it.  Just hang in there", which I'm sure these trapped men must have said numerous times, but as an audience, we get very restless with these limited scenes that seem to drag on too long.<br /><br />Finally, in spite of the films few flaws, it is very haunting and memorable.  We are not likely to ever forget the events of 9/11, but films like this are a great tribute to our American spirit and memorial to our heroes and bring to life the events some of us may have had trouble accepting as reality that day.  Being native New Yorkers now living in Lancaster, PA, the events of 9/11 have always felt a bit surreal to me and my wife.  I watched the towers be built.  My dad would take me to see the construction site periodically and it was always memorable.  My wife worked on the 98th floor of the North tower in the mid-1980's.  I even considered proposing to her there on the observation deck, but chose the more romantic Empire State Building.  I periodically worked for a department store located at the base of the towers when my wife worked there.  We would meet for lunch sometimes between the towers.  It is hard to grasp that anyone who worked with us back then who may have still worked there that day are gone.<br /><br />We have not been back to New York since 9/11.  We have not seen Ground Zero.  We have not seen the new Manhattan skyline which is now different than we last remembered.  We have not fully grieved for the lives lost that day and for whatever old co-workers we may have lost.  While some criticize Hollywood for exploiting the events of 9/11 for profit, I would rather think that films like this honor our fallen heroes, praise and uplift our survivors, and create an avenue for those who haven't fully grasped or grieved for the losses that day, an opportunity to do so.  I hope to visit Ground Zero at some point.  I'm still not ready.  Films like this may help to get me ready for a trip I know I have to make one day.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>An Oliver Stone picture without conspiracy and controversy.  This is a pretty straight forward tale of 2 port authority police officers on the day of 9/11.  They find themselves trapped under the rubble of one of the towers.  It also flashes often to their families and the effects it has one them.  This is a well made film, and it jumped right to the attacks within the first 15 minutes.  There is not much in the way of action, as the 2 main characters are pinned down and do not move the last hour and half of the picture.  It is haunting watching the images of the rubble and the shock on the people.  Decent acting all the way around, though the New York accents were exagerrated a bit.  Stone chose to focus on 2 people out of 20 that were pulled from the rubble.  Part of me would have liked to see the stories of some of the others.</p></br><a href="../users/A9RNMO9MUSMTJ.html">A9RNMO9MUSMTJ</a><br/><p>Time passes fast...as we are in 2007 already, but this event just seems<br /><br />like yesterday.

Working with a brilliant screenplay by Andrea Berloff, Stone is free of political agendas and cooking on four burners here.  We are about to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the tragic 9/11/01 terrorism events.  So Stone and Berloff could not be more timely with a movie about one aspect of those events.<br /><br />There must be a hundred stories about 9/11 that could be told, including Paul Greengrass' gut-wrenching UNITED 93 earlier this year and a documentary by Frenchmen on one fire brigade inside the twin towers five years ago.  The writer and director here focus on two real-life Port Authority policemen, the rookie Will Jimeno (Michael Pena) and Sgt. John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage).  They remain trapped under tons of rubble inside the ruins of the twin towers, while their sympathetic and complex wives Donna and Allison (Maria Bello and Maggie Gylenhaal) watch TV reports and await phone calls.  Stone and his editors cut back and forth, both dramatically and visually, between the darkness with the two trapped officers and the sunny brightness of the anxious wives.  All four main actors give magnificent performances.  And many extras are played by the real-life survivors of 9/11, who just play themselves.<br /><br />Stone told NEWSWEEK, in an August 7th cover story,  that WORLD TRADE CENTER was more a film about heroism than about terrorism.  I  have not seen the critically-acclaimed UNITED 93 yet, but the two movies should make a good double bill, if Stone's movie were not (an engrossing) 130 minutes.  He does show the aftermath of the twin tower attack and debris all over downtown Manhattan, without ever showing any terrorists.  Rather, Stone and Berloff (with an original screenplay refreshingly free of both gratuitous profanity and smoking) want to tell the exhilarating true story of two Port Authority policemen and their families on that fateful day--exhilarating because they come home to their wives with hugs, albeit long hospital recoveries.  People fearing a bleak ending, like UNITED 93 surely has, should know that Stone ends with a "two years later" picnic epilogue.  But there is also an eloquent roll call of the fallen on that tragic day.  This is a story I was glad to see told, and told by a master filmmaker at his best.<br /><br />The sets and visual effects, the falling debris and fires inside the towers where the two men are trapped, along with a lot of makeup blood, are awesome and deserve Oscars.  Clearly, a sizeable amount of WORLD TRADE CENTER was filmed on location.  But the set designers have built the twin tower ruins convincingly on a huge vacant lot in Marina Del Rey, south of Los Angeles.  It looks like the real thing to me as a film scholar who has been to NYC once long ago.<br /><br />Oliver Stone is the perfect filmmaker to make a 9/11 movie.  Working with real main characters, he is restricted in telling their dramatic stories faithfully and honestly.  Critics of him from, say, the underrated masterpiece JFK (1991), because of political agendas and polemics getting in the way of the storytelling, should be pleased to know that he just wants to tell a great story in WORLD TRADE CENTER; one about ordinary men and women as heroes.  It should make most moviegoers proud to be Americans.  I do hope it does well at the box office and on home video--incidentally, it was sensibly shot "flat" and not in "scope", so it should translate to pan/scan cable nicely.  Maybe for DVD, Stone can also lighten the twin tower rubble scenes a little; they were underlit in my tiny suburban multiplex screening room.  Unless he wants that much darkness for the scenes with McLoughlin and Jimeno.  Maybe they and the very gifted Berloff could all be interviewed on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA.html">A2D8CUJPOSRPNA</a><br/><p>In a lot of ways, the horrific events of September 11, 2001 are things that we as a nation here in America have still not yet come to grips with on any concise, clear-headed level without macho warmongering and bloodthirsty revenge intruding.  The bottom line is that, like the Holocaust, the 9/11 attacks were a prime example of Man's inhumanity to Man.  But there were acts of heroism that day that proved that there is more to us than murder and bloodshed.  This is what is at the heart of director Oliver Stone's film WORLD TRADE CENTER.<br /><br />Naturally, Stone's reputation as a political lightning rod, with films like PLATOON, BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, JFK, and NIXON, makes him a perfect whipping boy for the right-wing fanatics who would brand him a loony or anti-American while at the same time hypocritically using the 9/11 tragedy as so much political propaganda.  But in telling the true-life saga of Port Authority officers William McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) and Will Jimeno (Michael Pena), he has given us an example of both American and just plain HUMAN heorism that those on the far-right couldn't manufacture on even their best day.  McLoughlin and Jimeno had gone in, along with 340 of their fellow Port Authority officers, to rescue people trapped inside the World Trade Center towers that day, only to find themselves needing help when the towers collapsed around them and they were trapped under thousands of tons of debris for twenty hours.  Stone, a native of New York, shows us what the Big Apple's finest and bravest had on their hands that day, and brings this whole terrible ordeal to where it OUGHT to be--a personal and human level, not merely a polemic about gung-ho American patriotism, save, loosely, for the Marine who went in there to help Jimeno and McLoughlin out of their would-be grave.  He also shows us the horror and distress felt by the men's wives and families, often through flashbacks during their nightmarish ordeal under the rubble.<br /><br />Like the earlier 9/11 films of this year, the superb FLIGHT 93 and UNITED 93, WORLD TRADE CENTER looks at 9/11 from the point of view of what really matters--an apocalyptic event in human history in which brave people stood up and fought not only for their lives, but also to save hundreds, if not thousands, of others.  Cage and Pena do a fine job of portraying McLoughlin and Jimeno, respectively, and the entire cast and production move with deliberate pace under the careful direction of Stone, who has left the flashy but excellent editing style of JFK behind here for something much more contemplative.  This movie, as with FLIGHT 93 and UNITED 93, proves that Hollywood is ready to deal with the human nightmare of 9/11, and so too are the American people.  The question now is, Are the politicians out there ready to deal with it that way too?</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3TRGWOMA8LC.html">A1V3TRGWOMA8LC</a><br/><p>I was shocked to see this came from Oliver Stone with such a weak and predictable script and cable-TV quality production values. The plot uses the backdrop of 9/11 to get immediate audience sympathy but if the story had been about buried coal miners instead, it would have been more obvious what a one-dimensional screenplay was being used here.<br /><br />The film suffers from a very long saggy mid-section where not much happens for nearly an hour, apart from cutting between the buried men and their distraught families. Much of the A-list talent is lost on restrictive roles that any character actor could have whistled through. And fundamentally, for such a tragic and monumental event, this film fails to capture any of significance of what happened.<br /><br />For a better "man buried alive" story, try 127 Hours. For a significantly better film about 9/11 that truly captures the emotion, I'd recommend United 93. Otherwise, this is very weak movie that attempts to use 9/11 to pull at the heart strings but wastes the talent and doesn't deliver.</p></br><a href="../users/A293HA28PN3VO4.html">A293HA28PN3VO4</a><br/><p>I had a dentist appointment in Toms River, NJ on 9/11/2001. I watched, like many, in horror, at the events unfolding in NYC, and was completely devastated. Like many, I know exactly where I was, what my mom said to me, when she put on the news, and I saw the planes hit the towers on CNN. It was impossible, and ubelievable at the time.<br /><br />Since then, I've made it a point to become more involved in world events to understand all of the "behind the scenes" structure, and international events/politics, not just those on American soil to gain perspective on how horrible things like this can happen here and around the world.<br /><br />Although I can't imagine the pain that families who didn't know if their sons, daughters, lovers, sisters, friends and others, had perished, I have felt loss. This film captures at least some of this horrendous anxiety that was felt in the US, and specifically for everyone directly affected. I just watched this film, today,  9 years after the events (I previously also saw United 93).<br /><br />Sgtrictly from a cinematic standpoint, and as an avid hi-def collector, The PQ and sound on the HD DVD are spectacular and it's the special features that really make this story even more real. As an East Coast resident, it was too soon for me, to watch this in theaters. As an avid NYC visitor, I have friends who work or have friends/relatives in the area, and when I saw the movie today, for the 1st time, the movie captured the mayhem that they described.<br /><br />I actually think it was a good thing that only a handful of characters were chosen to attempt to tell an uplifting story and provide some focus. I've seen several WTC documentaries, to try to get my mind around this horrible event. Triumphs were rare that day, and unfortunately most of the 4000 total people who died, and their families were not able to celebrate any.<br /><br />This film was supposed to be an exception, a film about the sparse hope and miracles that existed that day. I don't believe you can make a 2 hour film with 40 characters. There were probably many different viewpoints and experiences amidst that chaos and no one can sum all of them up in 2 hours, not even a major director; it may even dilute the film, and create an overwhelming "split screen" type atmosphere. I felt emotionally invested in the characters, because there was focus.<br /><br />The method of involving a few families,created at least some frame work and representation of the events. And as is the case with all films about real wars, or other current events, the viewpoints, especially amidst chaos, will be as different as the stars in the universe. This was a very touching film, and I highly recommend that you take the time (and emotional energy) to watch it, and the extras, they are worth it. May we, and other people around the world, who have previously lived under the every day anxiety of death caused by terrorism, never have to experience another event life this again.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>It has been 7 years since that tragic day. I was in sixth grade when it happened. None of our teachers told us anything, so my dad told me about it, and I didn't know what to think!<br /><br />Nicolas Cage stars as Port Authority police officer John McLoughlin, and his friend, Will Jimeno who become trapped in the rubble of the World Trade Center. They struggle to survive and wait to be rescued. If you are a patriot, hate terrorists, and want to take a huge dump in Osama Bin Laden's mouth, you'll like WORLD TRADE CENTER!!!</p></br></body></html>

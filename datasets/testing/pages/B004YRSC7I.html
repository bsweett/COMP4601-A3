I have finally seen &quot;Memento&quot;, and now I know that it's not pure hype; this movie is outstanding!  This is one of my new favorite movies.  If you like movies that make you think (&quot;Fight Club,&quot; &quot;Unbreakable&quot;), then you will love this movie.<p>I will be quick and brief when I describe this movie, because this is another movie where you have to be careful on how you explain it or you'll give it away.  Leonard seems to be an ordinary man, but he's not.  He has a certain condition where he is unable to create new memories.  If he talks to someone too long, he will forget what he was talking about and whom he was talking to.  Leonard has an agenda in mind; to find and kill the person who raped and murdered his wife.  Leonard can remember everything before the &quot;incident,&quot; but he cannot remember anything new.  So he takes pictures of people to remember them and he tattoos important information all over on his body so he will remember things.  As his quest for vengeance continues, the more the twists and surprises come about.  Just when you think you know everything, you don't.<p>This movie was brilliantly directed.  The events in the movie are backwards and brief, which sort of gives us an idea of what the main character is going through.  All though you do not see a lot of actors in the film, the ones who are in it deliver top-notch performances.  Guy Pearce did an outstanding job and was the best actor in the movie.  The screenplay was mesmerizing and made the characters seem that more realistic.  There are a few extras on the DVD, but it would've been nice to have a few more in there, as always.<p>There are no guarantees that you will like this film.  Since this is such a unique film, it means that only certain people will like it.  I think it's worth viewing and even if you do not like the film, I think you'll admire how it was done.  Hey, I hated &quot;Citizen Kane,&quot; but even I can appreciate how it was filmed and directed.  If you don't want a film that's going to make you think, then don't see it.  If you want more action than story, don't see it.  Otherwise, give it a shot!  Since Leonard is so dependent on facts, here's a couple for you that will help you out during the movie:<p>FACT 1:  Pay close attention to the movie.  If I were you, I wouldn't take any breaks.  If you do, you might forget what has happened, and you'll lose the rhythmic flow of the movie.<p>FACT 2:  Nothing is what it seems.  Make sure you pay attention to every character and every conversation that takes place.<p>FACT 3:  Re-watch the movie.  This is the type of movie that likes to screw around with your brain!  You are very likely to be confused the first time around, but the second time should be a little more clearer.<p>This is a remarkable film and is an excellent thriller that outdoes most films.  Who are Leonard's friends and foes?  Who can he trust?  What is real and what is not?  You'll find that out soon when you see it.  &quot;Memento&quot; shows you that some memories are best forgotten.  What a spectacular movie!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I have just finished watching &quot;Memento&quot; on DVD and it is simply the best film I have seen all year.  I was hooked on this film from the opening sequence and even though I was in the ballpark in terms of unraveling the puzzle, the ending surprised me.  The most important thing is that the ending fit.  The idea of a man trying to find the person who raped and murdered his wife is old enough, but the twist of making the protagonist devoid of short-term memory is utterly fascinating.  But what makes &quot;Memento&quot; great is what writer/director Christopher Nolan does with that clever idea.  Those who complain that the story is one of those post-&quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; films that plays around with the time should just calm down and realize the story is simply being told in a regressive manner, with each scene taking us back for the next key piece in the puzzle.  Guy Pearce turns in an utterly convincing performance as Leonard Shelby, the man with a mission but no short-term memory, with Carrie-Anne Moss as Natalie, the woman who appears to be helping him, and Joe Pantoliano in a restrained performance as Teddy, who cannot be trusted according to the note Leonard has penned on the back of his polaroid.  The DVD version has a few select treats: Christopher Nolan is interviewed about both &quot;Memento&quot; and his previous film, &quot;Following&quot;; the short story by his brother Jonathan Nolan, which inspired the film and was written contemporaneously; background information about the characters and events you have to searh and find in the &quot;otnemem&quot; section.  If you have seen a better film noir than &quot;Memento,&quot; I bet it was in black and white...</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Memento is a film I had a little trouble following at times and I have to see it again to truly understand it. Still though, it's a really an original piece of work. It's not every film where you hear the lead charcater say &quot;I'm chasing someone,....oh wait, he's chasing me&quot;, I love scenes like that. Guy Pearce does a great job in the film too, it's an very unusual role and he handles it very well. Joe Pantalino and Carrie Anne Moss a very good too as the 2 people he trusts his memories with. Memento is brain twisting and a bit confusing but still, I loved it!</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>What a wonderfully realized concept for a thriller this is! Christopher Nolan adeptly manages to hold the strands of his main character's constantly disappearing memory together, but if not for the stunning performance of Guy Pearce the entire premise of the film would collapse like a house of cards. Joe Pantolino, and Carrie-Anne Moss are also excellent in this suspenseful, ever-twisting, puzzle that definitely puts the 'mind' in mindgame. MEMENTO is superb.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>Leonard is an insurance investigator whose memory has been damaged following a head injury he sustained after intervening on his wife's murder. His quality of life has been severely hampered after this event, and he can now only live a comprehendable life by tattooing notes on himself and taking pictures of things with a Polaroid camera. The movie is told in forward flashes of events that are to come that compensate for his unreliable memory, during which he has liaisons with various complex characters. Leonard badly wants revenge for his wife's murder, but, as numerous characters explain, there may be little point if he won't remember it in order to provide closure for him. The movie veers between these future occurrences and a telephone conversation Leonard is having in his motel room in which he compares his current state to that of a client whose claim he once dealt with. If you're looking for something intense, suspenseful, and different than your usual effects-packed thriller, this is the best movie. It's brilliant story telling. You might get frustrated because you don't know what's going on. That's okay. In fact, that's the whole idea. Sit back and find out just how twisted and complex Leonard's world is. You'll have a hard time forgetting how much you enjoyed it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>The reason Memento is so amazing is that it's told in reverse.  It's completely unique, a trend-setting idea.  There are small tidbits at a time, just enough to give a clue about what happened.  It's a truly amazing idea that keeps a viewer slightly off-center the entire movie.  Memento is truly ground-breaking when it comes to the movie-making aspect and story-telling style in cinema.<br /><br />The basic story of Memento is about revenge.  When someone wrongs someone you love, to what lengths would you go to avenge their death?  Now, throw in a slight road-block: you have no short-term memory.<br /><br />Leonard (Guy Pierce) wakes up unaware of anything.  The only clues he has are tattooed all over his body.  On his arms, on his chest, everywhere there is a patch of skin he has notes to himself.  The only thing he knows is that all his tattoos, and several polaroid photos, are clues towards the mystery that is his wife's rape and murder.<br /><br />The wide-reaching impact of short-term memory loss is immense.  A person could never go to school, learn a new language, quote a recent conversation, or visit an interesting site that was just happened upon.  And, depending on when the memory lapse hit, a person could forget something a simple as wiping after going to the bathroom.<br /><br />Of course, that could come in handy if someone happened to have a dreadful one night stand; they'd never have to own up to it.  Maybe they have a favorite book; each time it would be the best book ever.  Each surprise movie ending would be the same time and again (would really help when watching movies like Sixth Sense).<br /><br />Either way, the movie is incredibly well made, and a unique idea amidst a sea of retread garbage typically put out by major Hollywood productions.</p></br><a href="../users/A23GFTVIETX7DS.html">A23GFTVIETX7DS</a><br/><p>If you prefer mainstream entertainment, skip this film - and this review - right now.  However, if you revel in strange realities present with artsy cinematography, then Memento may be for you.  Leonard (Guy Pearce) has a "condition" that prevents him from creating new memories, and thus he is stuck only with the person he was before his wife's brutal death.  Now, he wakes up every few minutes to a new life organized only by Polaroid pictures, notes scribbled to himself, and a maze of tattoos scrawled over his body.  Leonard believes in facts, not memories, although the viewer soon discovers just how tenuous the relationship between fact and fiction really is.<br /><br />Although the film begins at what is essentially the end, the progression is as chronologically complex as Leonard's own fractured sense of time.  The vignettes, with scenes repeated and extended, gradually build on one another to give the viewer a fuller sense of what is really happening.  In this way, the characters are plastic, changing according to Leonard's latest understanding of them and then vanishing from his consciousness.  There's Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) and Natalie (Carrie-Ann Moss), two people who seem both friendly and malicious. Like Leonard, we have to learn anew about them in every scene.  These puzzling glimpses begin to assemble into something larger than even Leonard is willing to admit.<br /><br />While Memento falls into the postmodern realm of filmmaking, with its use of alternate realities and means of communication, it is not as riveting as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000067J1H">Fight Club (Widescreen Edition)</a> nor as humorously self-referential as <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLRE">Adaptation (Superbit Collection)</a>.  Nonetheless, this film is likely to grow on viewers who appreciate the unconventional.</p></br><a href="../users/A27RJ30RN5K9MX.html">A27RJ30RN5K9MX</a><br/><p>The film focuses on a man named Leonard Shelby ( Guy Pierce). He is obsessed with finding his wife's killer. On the night his wife was killed, he gets his head knocked while attempting to save her. This causes him to develop a condition. Leonard can only remember everything that happened up until the night of his wife's murder. He cannot make new memories, and forgets everything five minutes after it happens. This forces him to live a life based on a endless supply of notes, poloroids, and tatoos that he puts all over his body. We are introduced to the two main people in his life - Teddy ( Joe Pantoliano) and Natalie ( Carrie Ann Moss). Both claim to be a friend to him, but things are not as they seem. Both Teddy and Natalie have personal reasons behind wanting to help Leonard. Now Leonard must not only track down his wife's killer and deal with his condition, but he must also determine who's friend, and who's foe. <p>I am a sucker for a good mystery, and &quot;Memento&quot; is the most original and well executed mystery film that I have ever seen. The story is suspenseful and extremely complex. I love how Christopher Nolan had the film unfold in reverse. You come to feel very frustrated over the course of the film. However, that is also why the story is brilliant. You find yourself starting to feel exactly how Leonard does. This actually involves you in the film personally, and makes you sympathize for Leonard overall. The film's focus keeps switching back and forth between Leonard's search for the killer, and flashbacks into Leonard's prior life as an insurance investigator and his big case with a man named Sammy Jenkis ( Stephen Tobolowsky). I loved this aspect of the film, because Sammy suffers from the same condition as Leonard's. &quot;Memento&quot; is also guaranteed to keep you guessing. The film continually dangles clues in front of you. But since the story is told in reverse, what you are seeing, may not be what it seems! The film could not have succeeded without the performances given from the sctors. Guy Pierce's portrayal of Leonard is one of the best that I have ever seen. It is so realistic, and so convincing, that you come to believe that Guy Pearce actually went through the same thing himself. The fact that he made such a difficult role look so easy, still amazes me to this day. Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Ann Moss are also great. Their performances add to the film's suspense, because you never know what to believe. <p>Christopher Nolan's &quot;Memento&quot; is amazing. The film has great acting, a nice script, an intense, complex story, and an outstanding ending. The limited edition DVD only adds to the already flawless film. This 2 disc limited edition DVD is great because there are mindbenders and challenges you have to go through to get to the film. That brings the meaning of the word &quot;interactive&quot; to a whole new level! The special features include a Sundance Channel Documentary, the original short story By Jonathan Nolan, and much more.</p></br><a href="../users/A2II09GQGWOMTQ.html">A2II09GQGWOMTQ</a><br/><p>I have heard people rave about this movie since it came out.<br />Every great director has at least one defining film.<br />Speilberg had....lots of them. (Poltergeist, Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones etc...)<br />Cameron had Aliens and Terminator.<br />So I was anxious to see where Nolan really established himself in Hollywood.<br />And....<br />Let's get to it.<br /><br />The good.<br />Excellent acting.<br />Spot on pacing.<br />Great score.<br />It's one of the more artful films I've seen in recent memory.<br />It has a ton of twists and turns.<br />How the story is told is simply masterful, I can see a lot of Inception in this movie.<br /><br />The bad?<br />People may be thrown by the way the story is told but if you can't pay attention then don't even bother trying to watch this movie.<br />That's it for the bad really.<br /><br />As far as art movies go or even crime, thriller movies go.<br />This one is about as perfect as it gets.<br />Stunning from first frame to last.<br />Memento comes.....highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>Chris Nolan movies are starting to grow on me.  The director of Following, Batman, etc., tells a story of a guy who has no short-term memory, who keeps notes all over the place, even tattooing the more important ones, to remember what happened an hour or even ten minutes before.  It's also about a drug-dealing gal who wants to get back at her boyfriend and a few other guys and uses our hero's lack of memory to use him for her own vengeance.<br /><br />It's a story about vengeance and the blocks in the road to achieving it, that even with your handicap you can stay the course.  But what if the course is twisted and you can barely remember the whys and hows of it all?<br /><br />It's about a guy who feels guilty for what he did to a guy who had the same condition and also had a wife who died.<br /><br />Nolan's film is the most unusual cinematic adventure I've ever seen.  It's not your basic action thriller, though there's plenty of both.  It plays backwards.  You get the ending right from the start and then find how he got there.<br /><br />I heard that there is a "linear" version that goes from the "end" and moves to the "beginning", but that would be really dumb.  That defeats the whole premise!<br /><br />Get the DVDs on Amazon, it's a must-own for sure.<br /><br />Other Nolan films:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000F3CD">Following</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LC55F2">The Prestige</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001WQQWXA">Batman Begins, Two Disc Deluxe Edition, Hologram Cover</a></p></br><a href="../users/A2CK0VXUDVXGMN.html">A2CK0VXUDVXGMN</a><br/><p>Film noir taken in the sci fi genre maximum.

From <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00000F3CD">Following</a> to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LC55F2">The Prestige</a> but Memento stands out as my favorite.  Why?  It's not only one of the most original movies in a long time.  It's one of the best movies of the 2000's.<br /><br />Memento is the story of a man trying to find out who killed his wife, although he has more obstacles to face than your average revenge character does.  He has a problem with his memory.  He can't make new memories and can't retain anything for too long of a time.<br /><br />This movie is extremely engaging.  You don't want to miss a single moment of this film.  It's quite good too.  The story, although it seems to be told backwards, is actually told in a different non-linear way.  It jumps from place to place, although it's still easy to follow.  This isn't your normal blockbuster entertainment flick.  It's deep.<br /><br />The Limited Edition DVD release is one of the best releases of all time.  It is loaded to the brim with special features.  Includind an excellent audio commentary from Christopher Nolan, plenty of features, a trailer, making of featurettes, and some amazing hidden features including a chance to watch the movie chronologically.  I haven't yet tried this but it's definitely worth it to better understand the entire movie.<br /><br />This is a definite Must Have.  A thoroughly engaging movie and a DVD that gives it due respect.</p></br><a href="../users/A17FLA8HQOFVIG.html">A17FLA8HQOFVIG</a><br/><p>Brilliantly directed by Christopher Nolan, who also wrote the screenplay based on a short story by his brother, Jonathan Nolan, this film had to be a huge challenge for all.  The word "memento" means "remember" in Latin, and the story is about Leonard, so traumatized by a blow to the head after his wife's rape and murder, that he has lost his short-term memory. He's out for revenge and is looking for the killer, but, although he remembers his life with his wife and who he is, he cannot remember anything that has happened since.  He therefore takes Polaroid shots of everyone he meets and writes notes on them.  And he also tattoos things he wants to remember all over his body. The role calls out for an exceptional actor and Guy Pearce certainly does rise to the occasion.  I found myself drawn to him, identifying with his condition, and joining him in his struggle to relate to the world.<p>The story unfolds backwards, an unusual narrative technique that is tricky to use.  We see a scene and think we understand.  And then there is another scene that has happened prior to it, and it totally changes our perception of what is going on.  Purposely, it is confusing.  And purposely, there are moments of clarity where it all fits together only to become even more confusing in the next scene.  Carrie Ann Moss plays a femme fatal and, as we get to know her, we are not quite sure what her motives are.  Joe Pantolino is cast as in the role of Leonard's buddy, and we are constantly confused as to whether he is friend or foe.<p>I sat there fascinated as this complicated plot unfolded, enjoying the mastery in which the director led me down different avenues of thought and also introduced questions about the moral issues involved.  By the end, I was absolutely sure of nothing at all, except that I had been traveling on a roller coaster of an experience that didn't have any easy answers.  While I tend to want films to have a beginning, middle and end, and a story line that is easy to follow, this an exception to the rule.  I definitely recommend to those who are willing to explore this unique film, which is certainly one of a kind.</p></br><a href="../users/A27PSZX2SE0B51.html">A27PSZX2SE0B51</a><br/><p>This review will only deal with the features found on the &quot;Memento Limited Edition 2 Disc Set&quot;, and not the merits of the movie proper.<p>-------<p>My only qualm with this DVD edition is the packaging.  Wrapped in a tight-fitting but flimsy cardboard box, designed to look like Leonard Shelby's case file, it's almost impossible to get the discs out on first try.  I find that I have to open the back to push out the innards, which tends to warp the shape of the box.  Found inside are several loose sheets of paper, which look like psychological tests, notes from the case history, and, as you will soon see, the DVD's on-screen menus.  The whole thing is ostensibly held together by a little plastic paper clip, whose only real purpose, I've deduced, is to get lost behind my TV set.<p>The first thing one notices once Disc 1 of the DVD loads is a psychological test, asking the viewer to commit to memory a list of words that will go flashing by on the screen.  Don't be alarmed.  Although Chris Nolan and Co. have set up the DVD to look like a series of tests, you really don't have to read through or pay much attention to everything on the screen.  However, because sometimes they can be quite entertaining, I suggest you do.  &quot;Why are these people laughing at you?&quot; asks one question.  &quot;We know you did it,&quot; ominously states another.  This edition can get trippy if you let it.<p>After the memory flash, you are then asked to select from a list of words the ones you didn't see.  Like I said, this isn't really a test, but an ingenious way to present the disc's main menu.<p>Selecting WATCH plays the movie.  Selecting READ allows you to choose between English or Spanish subtitles, while LISTEN allows you to hear the movie in either English or French, 5.1 Dolby Digital or DTS 5.1 Surround Sound.  CHAPTER sends you right to the scene selection option.  And COMMENTS turns on Christopher Nolan's Director's Commentary track.<p>In my review of the commentary track for &quot;Following&quot;, Nolan's first movie, I called his delivery &quot;monotone... somnolent at times&quot; but that he's &quot;so smart and precise about what he's saying you can easily overlook that and become engrossed in the content.&quot;  I can say pretty much the same thing here.  Except that, in some ways, it's a less effective track.  Nolan spends a lot of time analyzing the story, deconstructing the main character, his motivations, the structure, etc.  They are the kind of out-loud thoughts a screenwriter might use when figuring out his screenplay, but serve little purpose for a viewer watching the film (okay, I suppose prospective screenwriters will get some value out of it).  It is thrilling to see how Nolan's big brain works, how he's thought through every situation, and has a reason for including everything in the movie.  But it's just one note played over and over for an hour and a half.  If Nolan had mixed things up a bit, included more anecdotal information, or behind the scenes goodies, it would have been a stellar track.  As it is, it's got a very narrow appeal.<br /><br />Disc 2 begins much the same way that Disc 1 did, except this time you are asked to view a series of pictures, and then are asked to select which picture from a list wasn't shown.  This is, as I'm sure you have guessed, the menu for the additional material features.<p>Selecting the COMPASS shows you a behind-the-scenes photo gallery, as well as pages from Leonard's Journal.  The BOOK allows you to read Nolan's script while listening to the audio track of the movie.  You are even privy to the notes he made in the margins of the script, offering further thoughts on how scenes might be filmed.  The GLOBE brings forth a whole mess of international promotional material, while the BINOCULARS give the option of viewing the international and North American theatrical trailers.<p>Selecting the SKULL starts a featurette, produced by the Sundance Channel, called &quot;Anatomy of a Scene&quot;.  Nolan, his editor, composer, producer, cinematographer, and one actor (Joey Pantoliano) discuss the whys and hows of the production.  Particular emphasis is given to the opening few scenes, detailing how they were set up to gently bring the audience into the aesthetic of the film.  Overall, the 25-minute segment further cements the notion that Nolan is an intelligent filmmaker, in full control of his cinematic palette.<p>Although not listed in the features on the DVD box, the much-ballyhooed 'Chronological Version' -- playing the scenes in the order in which they happen rather than back to front -- is here.  Trust me.  I just watched it.  I'm not going to tell you how to find this version, for I think that would be a spoiler on par with giving away the end (beginning?) of the movie.  But I will say that this information is available in several places online, so those of you who get frustrated with the puzzle should easily be able to obtain the answers (if not, drop me an e-mail).  And I must say, &quot;Memento&quot; is still quite a gripping tale when told this way.  But it does make Nolan's reason for telling the story his &quot;gimmicky&quot; way quite clear.  The problem with this feature, however, is that it doesn't offer you the option of fast forwarding or jumping from scene to scene.  So unless you can watch the whole movie in one sitting, you better not press 'stop'.<p>If you enjoyed &quot;Memento&quot; because it was a complex puzzle of a film, than I suspect you will enjoy this equally complex and even more puzzling DVD version.  I'm almost positive that there is more to this edition than the features I've listed above.  And I look forward to hunting for them in the future... or is that the past?</p></br><a href="../users/A2C27IQUH9N1Z.html">A2C27IQUH9N1Z</a><br/><p>Alfred Hitchcock was the master of Cinema's Rule One: 'Do not tell. SHOW.' Director/screenwriter Christopher Nolan takes that philosophy a step further in this film noir masterpiece by controlling not only the viewer's visual sense but their perception of time as well, reconstructing the protagonist's attempts to make sense of his world by reading the clues he leaves for himself (and us) and deciding who to trust in order to understand not only what occurs, but why. In effect, Nolan has rewritten the rule: 'Do not show. EXPERIENCE.'<p>The cast is exceptional, Guy Pearce in particular, and traditional film noir elements are executed very well, with haunting music, taut cinematography, smart dialogue, effective voiceover, and a constant search for motive. Humor is used sparingly and effectively. This is really an editor's film, and Dody Dorn deserves an Oscar nomination for editing this gem.<p>As for the DVD edition, it is a mixed bag. Though operationally a bit buggy, cinematically and artistically the special features are creative and fun. For instance, interesting scenes run behind the menus, and many film clips appear framed as Polaroid camera shots, both fun to watch and relevant to the film's concept. The original idea for the film was supplied by the director's brother Jonathan, who wrote a short story based on the same idea and designed the film's web site; information rendered from outside the time frame of the film, viewable on the DVD as newspaper clippings and notes by Guy Pearce's Leonard, are adapted from that web site. Also included are Jonathan Nolan's short story, an Independent Film Channel interview with Christopher Nolan, trailers from Memento and an earlier Nolan film, cast and director biographies, subtitles in English or Spanish, and a tattoo gallery (which looked interesting, but I couldn't get it to work on my Power Mac G4).  I wish more DVDs would incorporate this kind of material.<p>I was disappointed because I'd heard that on the DVD you could watch the film as if it was shot running forward but that is not here, unless you count running the chapters in reverse from the Chapter Selection feature. I would also have liked to have seen behind-the-scenes footage, especially storyboards.<p>This is a great film to watch with a group (as long as they don't talk during the film) so you can talk about it afterward. Nolan and crew can be proud of this fine film. The DVD extras could have been better, but they are still fun to play with.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>What's this?.......An original film idea?! A very cool un-compromising and un-common film? This movie actually gets better after each viewing?! An Amazing drama/thriller/mystery/action/suspenseful movie with a bit of humor! The 2 disc special edition is very good and has a good transfer.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AUOVXPT5MYX4.html">A1AUOVXPT5MYX4</a><br/><p>You'll either love or hate Memento. I just saw Memento and I have to say it is an great film. Memento ends as it begins, and the ending you see, before the credits roll, is chronologically the middle point of the story you watch unfold before you on screen. Confused? Well it is being shown to you in 5-10min. segments, progressing...or digressing I should say, from the end to the beginning. You are completely wrapped up in the life of Leonard Shelby, a man that suffers from short-term memory loss, and lives his life by following the photos and messages he has made for himself.<br /><br />The script is based on a short story by Johnatan Nolan. Christopher Nolan, his brother, wrote the script and directed the film, this being his second feature. It is difficult for me to go on about the plot, because it truly is an experience to walk in there not knowing anything. This was not the case for me. I read a few reviews, many better than the one you are reading now. I knew what to expect about the backwards storytelling, as well as a few key points about the main characters, but nothing that was really crucial. There is really nothing that can prepare you for this film.<br /><br />If you liked movies like Se7en, and Usual Suspects, than I definitely recommend the film. The similarities Memento has to those films are mostly in the overall tone, and that it is without a doubt a part of the Detective/Crime thriller genre. Leonard Shelby (played by Guy Pearce to a "T", he is Leonard Shelby!!), becomes the ultimate hard-boiled detective. He's got drive, that being to find the man that murdered his wife, and he's got his short term memory loss which makes his task go from difficult to near impossible. But, unlike those other films, Memento shocks you at the beginning of every segment, where you are once again left to figure out where you are and whats going on, to the point where you may eventually lose track. By the time you reach the climax ending, you will probably be frustrated having tried so hard to outsmart the film. Memento succeeds on many levels. It is among the greatest noir films ever made. It's got guns, cars, black humor, red herrings, and a femme fatale. It outshines Psycho in engaging the audience on a subliminal basis. Indeed, as a thriller, it ranks with Hitchcock's best. Best of all, it poses a number of profound BIG questions concerning the nature of man, his morality, and the basis for his civilizations and religions in such a subtle way that it almost seems an afterthought. Yes, this movie will really make you think. And it will make you want to talk to others about it. For people who love to see movies with excellent scripts, psychologic effects and complicated plots, this movie shouldn't be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>.sdrawkcab dlot si otnemeM  Excuse me.  I mean, Memento is told backwards, with the end at the beginning and the beginning at the end.  The story revolves around Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), an ex-insurance claims investigator who had to give up his job after he lost his ability to create new memories.  He lives by taking photos and keeping notes of his life.<br /><br />The last thing he remembers is two men raping and killing his wife.  So he has dedicated his new life to finding- and killing- the man who killed his wife and took away his memory.  All he knows about the man are the few facts that he pulled from the police file from the accident: his name is either John or James, and his surname's initial is G (John or James G.).  The man has a connection to illegal drugs, and he has a license plate number.  Along the way, he is joined by Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), a guy who he fears he cannot trust, and Natalie, a woman helping him out of pity.  Unfortunately for Leonard, though, his notes can be manipulated, and he soon realizes that no one can be fully trusted.<br /><br />The great thing about the way this movie is told is that, since we haven't seen the events leading up to a scene, we are just as in the dark about the situation as Leonard, and just when we think we have something figured out, our beliefs can be shattered in an instant when the truth is revealed.<br /><br />You'd think that with the end at the beginning, it would be impossible for there to be a twist ending (I know I thought so), but just the opposite is true; the final scene of this film will completely blow you away.<br /><br />This is one of the few thrillers as of late that succeeds in it's mission statement; to keep the viewer guessing and to deliver a killer twist ending.  I guarantee you'll be thinking about this film long after it is over.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>One might be tempted to dismiss the premise and structure of this film as a gimmick--but what a gimmick!  And so well done!  Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) has lost the ability to form new long-term memories, but that doesn't stop him from going after the man responsible for both his condition and a brutal attack on his wife.  The story unfolds in reverse so that the viewer is able to share Leonard's dilemma; he constantly finds himself in situations that he does not understand with no idea of what preceded.  It is fascinating to see the events leading to scenes that we have already witnessed.  It all culminates in a shattering revelation which Leonard, unfortunately, is doomed to forget...<p>Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Ann Moss deliver excellent supporting performances.</p></br><a href="../users/AWEOR1WZSMBEZ.html">AWEOR1WZSMBEZ</a><br/><p>It's uncommon manner of presentation makes this film unique &amp; sets it above the other suspense/thriller movies.

Moreover, watching it the 2nd time around makes you comprehend more.  You realize that you missed something during your 1st viewing, &amp; watching it again helps you understand the film better.

Who is a friend who is an enemy? This is what keeps you interested, this what keeps you guessing. I saw this movie at the theatre and what made it a great movie first time, apart from the excellent story and excellent acting from all concerned, is the surprise element and whilst if you are watching this movie for the first time it really is a rewarding experience, my concern with buying it on DVD, is that like many great thrillers it's maybe not so good for repeated viewings. Despite the fact that it is undoubtedly excellently crafted and has top notch performances from Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Anne Moss, it's the intrigue that holds the movie together and hold it together it does very well, for this is an excellent, very intelligent movie. I just feel that once you know the end of the movie (the beginning of the story) it might not hold the same allure (or your attention) second or third time around. If you haven't seen it though and you like slow-burn, complex, intelligent thrillers, this comes highly recommended and will hopefully bring Guy Pearce an Oscar nomination. If you are looking for something upbeat or fast paced this wont be for you...</p></br><a href="../users/A37DLVPKJZGSQF.html">A37DLVPKJZGSQF</a><br/><p>If you haven't seen Memento yet, Lord have mercy on your soul, run down to the video shop right now and rent a copy. This movie is truly unmissable. It has been highly praised by critics and audiences alike, and in general has Wowed the world. I mean, it even earned a place on the IMDb Top 10 (out of 250!) films of all time. That is pretty impressive. I can see exactly why the world loves the movie. It's different, exhilarating, amazingly engaging, original, smart, involving and endlessly entertaining. Memento is just everything you want out of a smart and fun movie. You truly get your money's worth with this one. Now, where should I start? Hmm, yes, Christopher Nolan. What a guy. He put his heart and soul into this movie and has come up with a true original. The script was actually adapted from a short story but extended to a film that seems so totally new and fresh you would never guess it had been adapted from anything. Christopher's direction is brilliant. He uses black and white for the unforgettable flashback scenes and colour for the scenes that are happening at that time. The film pretty goes backwards but is never confusing if you watch it carefully. Another great thing at the movie is Guy Pearce. He is one heck of a performer! While not only truly believable, he somehow possesses his character into amazing form. We never really know if Pearce is acting or not. There are plenty more great things about the movie. The editing is effective, especially within the first few minutes. The voice-overs help you to understand where the movie is taking itself. Carrie Anne-Moss's character is very intriguing. This movie is shocking, intriguing and truly unforgettable. If you haven't seen it by the time I've finished blabbing about how good it was, then you should get help. Preferably professional.</p></br><a href="../users/A15TNUM2PBS6F0.html">A15TNUM2PBS6F0</a><br/><p>I liked this movie alot, but I found that if I even turned my head away for a split second that I would miss something.  It's the kind of movie that you really need to pay attention to at all times.<br />It was a very interesting idea that was well crafted.  I think that Guy Pearce was amazing in this movie.  It has a few twists and turns that are well worth watcing.  The idea of telling everything in reverse was different, and there were only a few times that I truly felt confused.  (I think my husband asking me a thousand ??'s during the movie didn't help), I just may watch it again to see if I missed anything.<br />It's a original film, and one of the better films I've seen this year.  Worth a rental fee, just be in the mood it.</p></br><a href="../users/AQUVTQFFXP4AC.html">AQUVTQFFXP4AC</a><br/><p>***SPOILERS***<br /><br />Finishing watching this for the 5th or 6th time today, I learned yet another piece to the puzzle of this movie which put it together in a way that blew me away as much as the first time I watched it.<br /><br />I can go in depth into the reviews and how good the movie is, but that's been done already to death.  I'll explain to you still confused how this movie works, starting from the true beginning<br /><br />- All the black-and-white scenes come before the movie... Leonard is already on his journey attempting to find John G. and being lead by Officer Gammell on the phone (Teddy).  He finally finds the "John G." guy, a drug dealer called Jimmy Grant, and kills him.  It's revealed now that Teddy has already helped Leonard find the killer of his wife the year before, but since then he has only been using Leonard's condition and his need for vengeance for his own shady means---he set up Jimmy the drug dealer by pretending to have $200,000 worth of methamphetamines for sale, and planning to steal the money for himself.<br /><br />- Leonard realizes Teddy's plan, and distracts Teddy by throwing his keys in a bush, then he decides that if Teddy is going to be making him chase around John G.'s or James G.'s as long as possible for his own benefit, he's going to chase his own John G.... Teddy himself.  So he writes himself clues about Teddy, by writing "Don't believe his lies" on the back of his photo, and tattooing his license plate number on his body.  Thus Leonard is plotting revenge again, but not against his wife's murderer as he thinks, but against the guy who's been using him to kill people.<br /><br />- Thus the color scenes begin (unveiled in reverse in the movie) in which Leonard is trying to follow the clues to John G.  Teddy (the John G. Leonard is after) is trying his hardest to throw Leonard off course, and to get him to give up.  He then encounters Natalie, and she finds out that Teddy was involved in her boyfriend (Jimmy Grant, the drug dealer)'s death, and attempts to use Leonard to try and kill Teddy.  She doesn't realize he is already attempting to "find" him and kill him, as he set himself on this course to begin with (before losing his memory at that moment)<br /><br />- There must be some sort of ability for Leonard to remember things and his memory distorts these things the way he thinks it.  The big clue to this is when he tells Teddy that "memory can change the color of a car, it can change the shape of a room" and concludes with the true beginning, when Teddy reveals to him that there IS no "Sammy Jankis" as he thinks... the character he's been talking about throughout the movie was a fraud, and had no wife, whereas the story of his disillusioned wife was actually Leonard's wife, and that Sammy was actually Leonard.<br /><br />Really this was truly a unique film, and spellbinding.  It's so complex, you can't watch it only once.  You learn something new with every viewing.<br /><br />And the film also has a very very dark, grim aspect about it.  Aside from the fact that he can never live a normal life again, he can't trust anything or anyone, and he doesn't even realize he's a murderer, and will never remember that it was he who set himself against Teddy after learning that Teddy had been using him for his own selfish purposes.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PQNUIMLIOJ7R.html">A1PQNUIMLIOJ7R</a><br/><p>Memento is definitely my personal favorite movie. It is just above &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; on my list. The entire movie keeps the viewer's attention, as it is backwards. It is very fun to watch (alone or in a group). The acting is incredible, and so is the Academy Award nominated script. The editing was also nominated. I would recommend this movie to just about anybody. The R rating is due to violence and profanity, including a scene with an obscene amount of strong language. I can't say enough about this movie. There is nothing like it. There are no mistakes and it is completely unpredictable. I give it five stars out of five.</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>As most reviews mention, this film basically runs backwards - it's divided into 5-15 minute scenes, each scene ending where the previous scene started.  We meet the hero of the film, Leonard (Guy Pearce, in another great acting job) just as he has murdered a man named Teddy.  So we know what happened (Teddy is murdered), but we don't know why.  It turns out Leonard has brain damage and cannot make new long-term memories.  He can, however, condition himself (in a classical, Pavlovian sense), and so he writes notes to himself, takes pictures, and prints tatoos on his body to keep his life and quest straight.  The quest? - finding and killing the man who murdered his wife.  The first scene implies that Teddy must have been the murderer.  But is he, or is Leonard being set up by someone and can't remember it?  This is the crux of the question that is answered as we learn how Teddy came to be murdered.<br /><br />The gimmick - playing scenes in reverse order (but the scenes themselves play forward) - is essential for the enjoyment of the film.  First, it puts us squarely in the shoes of the protagonist, who always knows what he's doing, but doesn't really know why.  There are many visual clues - scratches on his face (how did they get there?), a picture of a man he's beaten up, a cryptic message on the photo of Teddy - "Don't believe his lies."  Second, the story is too straightforward to view in forward order - watching it in order would be no more interesting than a typical episode of Law and Order (much like viewing Pulp Fiction in chronological order).<br /><br />At this point, I should mention that the film has an unfair reputation of being difficult to follow and of being violent.  The most violent scene is, in fact, the opening credits, which are more violent by a long shot than the rest of the film.  Similarly, the film is not difficult to follow.  Sure, you may not be able to piece together every little detail (the same can be said for most good Film Noir) with just one viewing, but the answer to the question of the first scene - "why was Teddy killed and did he deserve to be" - is obviously resolved.<br /><br />There are two main problems with this DVD edition.  One is with the film: Leonard's memory problem seems to vary with the needs of the plot.  At times he can hold things in his head for a long time, at other times he forgets in the middle of doing something (for example, at one point he is in the process of running and can't remember why, but at another point he manages to gather up a bunch of items, drive to a deserted lot, and burn them, which must have taken quite some time).  This is something you only think about anfterwards, though, so it does not detract from the film.  The second problem, for which I deducted a star (it's really a 4-star film) is the fact that this particular DVD edition is extremely bare-bones.  There is a special edition of Memento, which would be the recommended format for repeated viewings.<br /><br />All-in-all, though, this is a very enjoyable movie.  It's the type of film that many people will want to own and watch repeatedly to understand all the little nuances of the plot.  That's not to say that the film doesn't hold up to a single viewing - it's very interesting and intriguing, mostly because of the manner in which the film is constructed, but also due to the actors, who do a good job throughout.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Christopher Nolan's mind-bending thriller "Memento" is one of those rare instances in which the form of a movie is designed to match its content.  Here is a film all about the nature of short-term memory, which, by its own ingenious structure, challenges the audience to cope with its own mastery of short-term memory.  <p>Guy Pearce stars as Leonard Shelby, a man who suffers from a "condition" brought on by a trauma to the head that prevents him from being able to retain any short-term memories (he can remember his life only up to the moment of his wife's rape and murder).  To cope with his affliction, Leonard writes himself copious notes, mostly on the backs of polaroids he takes on a regular basis but sometimes on his own body in the form of informational tattoos.  To approximate the sense of dislocation of time and place that Leonard feels on a daily basis - as he has to reorient himself to people and events he has recently met and since forgotten - Nolan has chosen to structure his film in a backward progression, so that the first scene ends up being the most recent and the final scene the earliest in time.  This technique is not exactly an original one, since the 1983 movie "Betrayal" used roughly the same format in the context of a romantic drama.  Still, "Memento" deserves enormous credit not only for trusting its audience to be able to cope with this complex style but for managing to keep most of the plot details well-focused and coherent for most of the film's duration.<p>One of the risks of a film like "Memento" is that it could, if handled badly, easily become a mere exercise in technical "gimmickry."  One of the ways that Nolan avoids that trap is by devising a plot that is as gripping as any to be found in a traditionally structured example of film noir.  "Memento" is filled with the kinds of narrative twists and turns, surprise revelations and moral ambiguities that form the basis for any good example of the genre.  More important, Nolan makes Leonard a compellingly sympathetic character, one whom we come to care for because his plight is so heartrending at its core.  Here is a man who not only has to deal with the immense incomprehensibilities of his life but who cannot even benefit from the time factor that helps mourning people come to terms with the loss of a loved one.  To Leonard, his wife's death is a perpetual recent event, one from which he can never attain that emotional distance so key to finally overcoming his grief.<p>Special note should be taken of Guy Pearce, who delivers a knockout performance as Leonard, perfectly capturing the determination, frustration and emotional pain that define the character.  Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano offer superb support as two perpetual "strangers" who play significant roles in Leonard's strangely dislocated and fragmented life - yet just what those roles are is as much a mystery to us as it is to Leonard.  David Julyan's subtle and haunting musical score and Wally Pfister's fine cinematography greatly contribute to the unique quality of the film.<p>Watching "Memento" is like entering a strange, mystical dream.  Like Leonard, we feel as if we have suddenly been stripped of that ability to fully make sense out of the chaotic world around us.  We feel cut loose from our mental moorings and find ourselves adrift in a world bereft of the rules of chronological reasoning we cling to so desperately for survival.  How many movies actually manage to shift our paradigm of perception and make us look anew at the way we observe the world around us?  Not many, I can assure you.<p>Christopher Nolan's brilliant and audacious cinematic tour de force reawakens our faith in the medium and those who dare to challenge it.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>The memory is selectively greedy. The overall amount of the selected repertoire depends of you and your personal bliss.<br /><br />This powerful and challenging Noir has to do with a simple question: what about you or me if suddenly the lights of the memory simply turn off? What if your capacity to remember is no longer than five minutes?<br /><br />The dramatic and awful premise: a horrid murder and a serious cerebral damage will make your name still persists but your entire life since that moment will be a total mess, a complicated puzzle of photographs, annotations, addresses, footnotes, faces, false names are the lost fragments product of a bloody explosion, that has caused a true virulent disorder of the vital synapses, reduced to occasional flashes.<br /><br />A man without memory will become a desperate man; he needs to belong a country, be part of a community, for love and be loved and so nourish his imagination,  to expand his intelligence and so  to learn and grow up. On the other hand a man with just a memory becomes a modern Faust. Between these two extremes, this anguished man will desperately seek the origin of his emotional wounds to restore a minimum of necessary equilibrium.<br /><br />This striking film - supported by a breathtaking script - integrates an astonishing and fundamental Quartet of golden movies: Twelve monkeys, Dark city and Mulholland drive.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BFIYZYNK54QX.html">A2BFIYZYNK54QX</a><br/><p>MEMENTO: Christopher Nolan's groundbreaking film that revealed to the world that he was one of the most unique new voices in cinema; a man that would prove to be one of the best filmmakers of the last two decades.<br /><br />I saw this film when it first came out in theaters, and I haven't seen it since. So why the 5-star rating? I was so totally compelled and profoundly disturbed by the film that it falls into the category of "Brilliant Films I'll Never See Again" (Another recent example of that is MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE). Guy Pearce is the kind of actor who never seems to get the acclaim he so richly deserves, and he's astonishing as Leonard. Joey Pants (Pantoliano) is chewing up a good deal of scenery in this film and certainly appears to steal some scenes, but Pearce's self-effacing charm and quiet intensity make you unable to take your eyes off him. Carrie-Anne Moss doesn't amount to as much as I would have preferred, although that may be more to do with her rather uninteresting performance.<br /><br />When you get right down to it, the film ultimately belongs to Nolan. By using the reverse-order single-scene narrative, he makes a film that is very uncomfortable to watch since the film essentially is taking place inside Leonard's fractured mind. Being inside of a mind like that is such a disturbing place to be, and I think that's what keeps me from watching the film again, but I can still say without a doubt, I still realize what a powerful, suspenseful and great film MEMENTO is, and I am doubly glad that Chris Nolan continues to make films that not only defy Hollywood convention, but they also push you and challenge your ideas. In another life, Nolan designed great mazes and created great riddles. In this life, you get to see them unfold on-screen, even if you don't get the answer or find the exit.<br /><br />With the exception of INSOMNIA, which is a film I respect but don't like, Nolan has made some of the very best films of the last decade. From THE PRESTIGE to BATMAN BEGINS to THE DARK KNIGHT to INCEPTION and MEMENTO, Nolan is now a name on par with the very best cinema has to offer.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N49TOJZFG48H.html">A1N49TOJZFG48H</a><br/><p>TAXI DRIVER good . even the DARK KNIGHT can't get you here . genius(s) . a true collaboration with his biological brothers in vision .</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>The movie's premise works.

Everybody is believable. The editing and sets were not great, but the story is what draws you in.<br /><br />The main twist of the movie is the main character does not have short term memory. The technique of telling the story backwards draws the veiwer into the main character's confusion and frustration. The story gradually unfolds not only the mystery, but the protaganist's dismal and painful life. However, the protagonist keeps his sense of humor. It is an amazing experience.<br /><br />The movie is an unique experience and well worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z2ZN39LL07GI.html">A1Z2ZN39LL07GI</a><br/><p>i buy this edition because i see the review of blu-ray not very good for special feature.

I had heard plenty of buzz about this film for years, but only recently saw it. At many points, I think the viewers are as perplexed as Leonard Shelby. Leonard Shelby(Guy Pearce), searching for his wife's killer, has a rare condition that doesn't allow him to remember certain events. Events are remembered only in a haphazard way, and, for this reason, he uses notes and pictures as an aid for his memory. What makes the film unique is simply the way it is told, using a non-linear or chronological way of telling the story, but rather scattered and fragmented bits and pieces of time through the point of view of Leonard. We have 10-15 minute segments that reveal events and partial memories, and we are constantly rewinding and fast forwarding to a slightly different version of the plot. It's a bit jarring at first, and difficult to follow, but it doesn't alienate the audience, and eventually the viewer is able to pick up on this type of narrative. Give Nolan credit for pulling off such a film and having very few inconsistencies. Several key characters could make or break the case in Leonard's search, but his reliance on scraps of paper and notes only give him partial, vague clues about who to trust. Therefore, from Leonard's point of view, the line between friend and enemy is always indistinct. Memento somehow manages to mimic its storyline with its film techniques, with scattered clues here and there, and is a cerebral whodunit experience for the viewer to try to piece together. It is also a unique, stylish, film that has great pacing and building suspense, and finishes with a nice twist. Just the kind of film for those who are sick of the same old, same old that Hollywood spews out. As far as the extras, they were so-so, hence the 4 star instead of 5 star rating.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PBV1899CX3TE.html">A2PBV1899CX3TE</a><br/><p>Though Memento wasn't Christopher Nolan's very first film, it was his first shot at the big time, as Doodlebug was a 3 minute short and Following was a student film made on a budget of under $6,000. So, you could call Memento a memento of Christopher Nolan's inception as a professional director. It is based on a story that his brother Jonathan wrote about a man who suffers from Anterograde Amnesia--the inability to form new memories after damage to the hippocampus. This character is named Leonard Shelby and he is played by the versatile Australian Actor, Guy Pearce:<br /><br />---------<br />Leonard Shelby: It's just an anonymous room. There's nothing in the drawers. But you look anyway. Nothing except the Gideon bible, which I, of course, read religiously.<br />===============<br /><br />Pearce is really good in this, and though the premise has a built in catch--since he can't remember anything he continuously says the same things and tells the same stories until the people he meets and the audience are both totally fed up--I enjoyed his performance a lot. Leonard is bent on getting revenge on the man who murdered his wife, but his memory problem not only makes this especially difficult--he takes notes, Polaroids, and even has important "facts" tattooed on himself in a futile attempt to keep track of it all--it also makes us doubt the veracity of his subjective view of reality. Is he really on track to get revenge, or is he being manipulated by others with their own agendas? And if he does get revenge, how will he enjoy that dish--best served cold--if he can't even remember it being served? And even the memories he does have, the ones formed before the accident, how does he know that they are true?<br /><br />Leonard Shelby--and the other characters, too--are all the ultimate Unreliable Narrators. I first heard the term in conjunction with the novel The Good Soldier by Ford Maddox Ford, but if you watch the director's interview in the DVD bonus material, Nolan uses it to describe Leonard. Such elevated concepts and questioning of the very nature of reality are the hallmarks of Nolan's films. He is a rare director who can both toy with philosophy and a big budget, and still fill the seats. An art house director whose films are blockbusters. Memento, while certainly no blockbuster, was at least successful enough to allow him to keep making films. I have not seen Inception yet, but it seems to be doing very well at the box office, while sporting a convoluted and deep plot that once again questions the nature of reality. Both Memento and Inception remind me in a way of The Matrix, and by the way, the other two supporting cast members--Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano--were both in The Matrix as Trinity and Cypher respectively. They are both feeding Shelby stories that may or may not be true. In Memento, who isn't an Unreliable Narrator?<br /><br />The fun of watching Memento is putting together the pieces of the puzzle. It alternates between flashback scenes, which are in black and white, and color scenes that are present time, moving forward. The chronology of this approach is identical to the way F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote The Great Gatsby with each flashback sequence going further and further back in time until at the end the puzzle of Gatsby's greatness is solved. Now that I think of it, Nick Carraway was also a kind of Unreliable Narrator, because the first thing he says is:<br /><br />In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.<br /><br />"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one," he told me, "just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had."<br /><br />And Carraway then proceeds to use the rest of the book to harshly judge and criticize just about everyone, advantaged or not.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790734850">L.A.

A mans wife is killed and needs to seek out the killer and other people get thrown into the story. Now take that concept and show it to the movie going public....backwards! What you get is Christopher Nolans' masterpiece 'Memento'.<br /><br />This is one of those movies that really keeps you on the edge of your seat. Eventhough you know exactly how the movie is going to end you are just waiting to see how the story got to that very point. A story like keeps you watching and thinking and that's probably why this movie is praised by millions. The cast is phenomenal and package is perfect. The funny thing is Nolan is now this huge director because of his re-inventing the Batman franchise. People may soon...forget that he was just as good of a director before that. That's why this film should be a true...memento for your collection. It is such an incredible movie it is not to be missed.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>I see that some reviewers have given away a bit more of the story than I would have, but this does save me the trouble of recapping anything.<br /><br />I'll just say that it's every bit the "instant classic thriller" promised on the DVD cover, that it's both full of action and mentally stimulating, and that I will watch it again, which I've never said about a "thriller" before.  I'm also looking forward to watching the bonus DVD once I've let a little time pass, just to satisfy my curiosity.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and notice how the majority of us are giving this 5-star reviews.  There's a reason we do that.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RB6NQOLOBXYD.html">A3RB6NQOLOBXYD</a><br/><p>I hate to see when a good, different, quality, movie is completley over looked at in Hollywood. In the movie "Memento" starring Guy Pierce, gives a good performance as a man who suffers from a memory disorder in which he can't make new memories after a severe accident with a killer who murdered his wife. Since he cannot make new memories, he has to write all information on photographs. Guy Pierce does not know who his friends or enemies are. He has to rely on his photogrpah notes to catch the murderer. When you first watch the movie you maybe confused like I was, because they play the movie backwards. But in the end it all comes out to a great ending. Infact, I had to watch the movie again to look some parts over. The suspense and intensity is unbelievable. Like I said Guy Pierce gives a good solid performance along with Joey pants, (A friend or a foe). Whats sad is that the movie almost did not go into production. The movie was finished filming around 97' but did not get released in theaters till 2000. It was also played in very select theaters as well. But it still frustrates me when i see a great movie that doesn't get any respect. This is why i hate Hollywood, they pump all these bogus movies up like the sixth sense, the village, and all those other lame thrillers but this one is left in the dust? You wanna see interesting thriller see Memento it won't dissapoint you. As far as the dvd goes, 5 stars as well. The limited edition especially is amazing. Cool artwork and sweet packaging. the menu screens and chapter selections are interesting as well, it gives a good intro to the mood of the movie. The special features are interesting as well, solid commentary, nice behind the scenes, ect. Quality wise, this dvd  won't dissapoint you either, DTS. 5.1 surround sound and a clear crisp transfer. Buy this.....</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>Christopher Nolan's "Memento" is one of the landmark films of the new century.  The film is distinguished by powerhouse storytelling, snappy editing, and great acting.  The basic story concerns Leonard(Guy Pearce) a man suffering from short-term memory loss who is attempting to unravel the mystery of his wife's murder.  Leonard's efforts include a network of body tattoos, Polaroid pictures, and handwritten notes he leaves for himself.  As Leonard attempts to piece together the mystery the question arises as to the reliability of these reminders.  Leonard's condition also subjects him to the exploitation from some malevolent forces.  Pearce gives an extraordinary performance as Leonard and is ably supported by Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss, characters whose motives in "helping" Leonard could come under suspicion.</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>What's good about this movie is the innovative way it's told rather than the story.  If told in sequential fashion, I don't think this movie would have made much of an impression on the viewer or had the impact it obviously did.<p>Well done!</p></br><a href="../users/AVCRD98TH48RN.html">AVCRD98TH48RN</a><br/><p>This is truly an original film.  Once in a while a film or filmmaker comes along and completely destroys all conventional ideas about how to make a movie.  This film is told in reverse order and by the end it completes a loop where the viewer could push 'play' on his DVD player and continue with the story, forever.  From the very first scene it is obvious that something unusual is about to happen.  The photography itself is run in reverse to set the tone of the story.  Not to be lost in the disjointed narrative are three great acting performances from Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano, and most notably the lead actor, Guy Pearce, whose role in "L.A. Confidential" began my personal respect for his talent.  This is high quality filmmaking on all levels.  It is true that the first time I saw this, by movie's end, I wanted to scream.  The director, Christopher Nolan, forces the audience to remember each previous scene in detail leading up to the end, thus making the audience identify with the main character who suffers from short-term memory loss.  This is a unique film, and I am proud to have it in my collection.  Later.</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>This sort of movie is not really my thing, but I enjoyed it just the same, and I can recognize it certainly is a fine movie. I prefer more visually appealing screen blockbuster action-type flicks with lots of special effects myself, but there are a lot of classic movies I enjoy, and this one will probably become a classic in its own right.<p>The overall premise is quite interesting, since the scenes occur in reverse order, as you watch the memory-impaired Guy Pearce try to solve the mystery of his wife's murder. Pearce does an excellent job in the role, as he methodically gathers the evidence and tries to sort it all out despite his memory impairment.<p>Before his memory defect occurred, he was an insurance fraud investigator, and if it's one thing he learned from his old job, it's the importance of having a system for gathering the facts and considering the evidence. Pearce does just that, and by taking photos and writing notes on them, he is able to remind himself of the facts he has discovered during the course of his investigation and ultimately solve the mystery.<p>One minor fault. In the movie, Pearce denies a claimant his insurance money because he "proves" that his impairment isn't due to disabling neurological causes, but due to his lack of effort to remember. In fact, from the symptoms, the guy obviously has what's known as complete anterograde amnesia, which is the opposite of the famous retrograde amnesia that many people are familiar with and has been used equally sensationally in movies. Pearce doesn't believe it's real, or at least he can throw enough doubt on the case to give his insurance company a way out, and thereby deny the man his money. <p>I also enjoyed Pearce's role as the professor in the recent remake of the Time Machine. All in all a fine flick and worth seeing even if you're not into more thoughtful kinds of movies like this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KUUII2GSHN7T.html">A3KUUII2GSHN7T</a><br/><p>The most well crafted film in recent memory.  I loved this film but be warned, it may require intense disussion amongst friends at the end of the film.  <p>If you like films like the Usual Suspects and LA Confidential(and who doesn't?), then this film will be right up your alley. It has a plot twist that is second to none. Guy Pearce does an astonishing job in this film and you'd never know he was an Aussie from the vocal job he does in this movie.  WATCH IT AS SOON AS YOU CAN!<p>...</p></br><a href="../users/AZ5250G2U795I.html">AZ5250G2U795I</a><br/><p>As great as this movie is...it's not for everyone. <p>That being said, I'll tell you why I see it as a WOW!  Christopher Nolan has created a piece that is unmatched in it's originally and is on par with 'The Usual Suspects' in terms of storytelling at it's finest.  The script is tight, and the performances (Guy Pearce...if you haven't heard of him yet, trust me...you will!) are solid.<p>The fact this film is told backwards gives you an intimate 'bond' with the protagonist, in that you can't remember what happened before either, and this adds a dimension that few films can project.  But, you can't 'leave' for a second.  If you have to do anything, pause it, because little clues are left all throughout the movie, and the different way the story is told can also leave you feeling lost if you miss some of it.<p>This is a true gem of a film that it's a shame it didn't get more buzz early on.</p></br><a href="../users/ASHT96DUVMF1S.html">ASHT96DUVMF1S</a><br/><p>Not only is the packaging excellent it has a number of special features just waiting for you to access.  Disc two is loaded with an array of questions which upon answering you are either allowed to move forward or sent back to the previous page.  For those who haven't seen Memento please watch this movie. You will thank me later.  I always recommend this movie as a must see.  Anyone going to buy or rent a movie needs to check out Memento.  It is pure movie enjoyment.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>"The mind is a terrible thing to waste." However, most of us take our minds for granted every moment of every day. The thought of losing one's mind is quite frightening and is the premise for the movie MEMENTO.<p>In MEMENTO, Guy Pearce (L.A. CONFIDENTIAL) plays Leonard "Lenny" Shely, a man who is trying to track down his wife's killer. However, Leonard has no short term memory. He can remember everything until his wife's murder, but then his mind is a blank. He meets a new person and within five minutes, he forgets. He goes somewhere then forgets where he's at and why he's there. To help himself survive, Leonard takes Polaroid pictures of everything and writes important details on the back. However, the most important pieces of information he gets tatooed on his body. Lenny's tired of living this way, but must keep on until he finds his wife's killer.<p>Pearce's performance catches all the nuances of a man who has literally lost his mind. And Carrie-Anne Moss (Matrix) and Joe Pantoliano pull off superb performances in their major supporting roles.<p>Christopher Nolan's direction is pure genius. The story of MEMENTO is told backwards. At first the idea seems absurd, but it works brilliantly. The audience is given a taste of what Leonard's life is like because they only see the story one segment at a time, never knowing what happened before. It makes for a film full of suspense, energy, and excitement.</p></br><a href="../users/A25HYPL2XKQPZB.html">A25HYPL2XKQPZB</a><br/><p>Memento is a great movie.  By reading other reviews, you can get the idea of the plot.  I watched this expecting unique storytelling and a great climax.<p>Memento begins with a murder and then works its way back through the eyes of Lenny who has know short term memory.  Each scene begins with us not knowing how Lenny got there.  This is appropriate (not a gimmick) since Lenny has no idea either. <p>I paid attention to each scene trying not to miss any details that would confuse the ending.  But there really aren't any details to miss.  The ending covers all the bases and explains everything, yet there are many unresoved questions, and I think the director Nolan wanted it that way.<p>While Memento was unique, it was also quite humorous.  Guy Pierce did an excellent job of portraying Lenny.  Lenny seemed so trusting of everyone and since he had no memory of them, he assumed they were always being honest with him.<p>So while this movie is dark at its core, it portrays an innocence and lightheartedness that makes it fun to watch.<p>If you watch this movie and are somewhat confused then check out the movie's website.  It gives a lot of good information that may shed light on Lenny's condition.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Before Christopher Nolan would be tapped to direct a remake of 2002's Insomnia, he directed this modest budgeted thriller that sets bold new standards in mystery and suspense cinema.  Guy Pearce (Ravenous) plays a man named Leonard Shelby who is searching for the man that raped and murdered his wife.  That alone is pretty much the plot, but what sets Memento apart from other revenge themed thrillers is the fact that the film moves backwards event wise.  The film starts out from the end and works it's way back to the beginning, letting the viewer find out not just how something happened, but why it happened.  Memento is presented in this form due to the fact that Leonard suffers from a condition received when his wife was attacked that stops his brain from making new memories.  Lenny can't remember faces, names, locations, or anything else on his own so he takes Polaroid photos, writes endless amounts of organized notes, and even makes himself home made tattoos.  Pearce is simply unbelieveable in his role as the tortured soul Lenny, while Joe Pantoliano (The Matrix, tv's The Sopranos) almost steals Pearce's thunder as Teddy, a man who may or may not be on Lenny's side.  Carrie-Anne Moss (another Matrix alumnus) plays a sympathetic soul to Lenny's crisis while hiding ulterior motives, and she gives a knockout performance as well.  Memento requires more than one viewing to fully understand the complex storyline, but once you do you'll be left with your jaw on the floor.  All in all, those looking for something delightfully different and intelligent should definitely give Memento a well deserved look.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XX5797TIZT5Q.html">A1XX5797TIZT5Q</a><br/><p>Formalistic experiments in film can be a hit-or-miss affair.  Most filmmakers playing with form -- in narrative or visual presentation -- find it difficult to marry the experiments they want to conduct with a compelling story.  Memento writer/director Christopher Nolan flies out from among his competition by finding a story which by nature demands an unconventional narrative approach, making Memento the four-aces masterpiece it is.<p>The amazing thing is that Nolan makes you hang on to a story in which you find out the ultimate outcome of the plot in the very beginning.  Memento, however, makes you care about *how* something happened, the cause of the effects, and somehow manages to generate suspense even though you're watching events unfold backwards.  An astonishing writing feat.  The actors do a terrific job -- Guy Pearce wisely holds himself back and delivers a low-key, simmering performance and a deadpan voice-over job that are instantly winning; Carrie-Anne Moss continues to make smart choices in edgy roles, not content to milk her sex-symbol status; Joe Pantoliano's smarmy charisma comes through yet again as he chomps lines with gusto, coming out with some of the funniest moments in the film.  Nolan mines the central conceit of a character with no short-term memory for fresh comedic moments, and this also helps keep your attention even if you might sometimes get lost in its complicated plot.  And of course, the bounty of story twists and revelations make this movie a terrific rewatch experience.<p>One of the best films of 2001, and certainly the most original.</p></br><a href="../users/AMIOLJHCQHGBE.html">AMIOLJHCQHGBE</a><br/><p>I watched this movie three times. The first time, I thought it w the perfect example of overblown avent garde, with redeeming visual factors. The 2nd time, I was drunk, so I liked it. The third time (gotta give everything a chance) I realized I liked this movie more than the second time, even with the flaws. I flat out found it intriguing. wanna get this? Okay. Close your mental eyes. You have no short term memory. I mean NO short term memory. Anything that happened 15 minute ago has evaporated from your brain. The only way you can identify (NOT REMEMBER!Only long term memories exist) with anything, is by the photos in your pocket, or the bold tattoos you've had inked on your arms and legs. each of these are a direction to solving the murder of your wife, and the bludgeoning that resulted in your memory loss. Now, don't trust anyone, especially those who proclaim themselves to be your friends. Not a bad premise eh? Now, live your life in reverse from a seamy hotel room you're not sure if you rented... The only clues other than the tattoos (they are new each time you wake up) are notes you've jotted down on the backs of polaroids you THINK you've taken. The result? You are basically (...)no matter what you do.<p>The actors? Don't worry about any big names other than Joe Pantelione He's the best of the bunch.<p>I can only tell you this, I was very weirded out. If you enjoyed Things To Do In Denver (Andy Garcia/Christopher Walken) you will count this as a film to watch three times.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198FZZMTJ38H.html">A2198FZZMTJ38H</a><br/><p>The state of confusion I am left in after watching &quot;Memento&quot; is one that is as thought-provoking as it is maddening. The plot twists and surprises that director Christopher Nolan employs in his energetic, frenetic script are intelligent to a fault, ones that tease the mind for hours after the film has ended. And while I was still left with questions about certain plot points and character relations, I was nonetheless enthralled by the experience. <p>At the center of this frenzy is Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), a former insurance investigator in search of the man responsible for the rape and murder of his wife. His search is complicated by the fact that, due to his inability to create new memories, his short-term memory is of no help. He quickly forgets the beginnings of conversations with those he comes in contact with; his only way of staying on track are small notes on paper, Polaroids of those he meets and their names, and homemade tattoos that cover his chest and left thigh. <p>And here's a surprising twist: the film is told from the end to the beginning, starting out with what should be the film's climax and taking things from there to the very beginning of Leonard's search. This is little more than a device, though it tends to make us ponder the film's many machinations on a much more intricate level of thought. There is more to keep up with, which makes it even more interesting. <p>As we progress into the film, we are introduced to characters that Leonard has already interacted with at some earlier point in the reversed story. By the movie's midpoint, many of the puzzle pieces are in place: Leonard has been receiving help from Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss), who is out for revenge against someone who took the life of her own love. At the same time, Leonard interacts with the man we see him killing in the beginning, Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), who offers him information we automatically assume is bogus. <p>Or is it? The movie keeps this a secret even after its ending, inviting us to think on the subject, to ponder on the film's many turns and spins. There are so many questions that come to mind: who is really responsible for the murder of his wife? Who is the real ringmaster behind all of the mayhem that goes on throughout the film? Who is the mastermind? By the time we finish thinking about it, we're more concerned with who is on top rather than who killed Mrs. Shelby. <p>And that is precisely what makes this such a fascinating film. It will turn many off for its lack of a final resolution that is blatantly obvious to everyone, but those in the mood for some deep thought will not pass this up. The ending provides no answers, no easy solution to its complex formula of mystery, leaving we, the viewers, to ponder the final conclusion in our own minds, and decipher what has just come to pass in front of our eyes. <p>The film has its share of effective performances that range from subtle mysterious to all-out masterful. Guy Pearce brings a hushed fervor to his character, embodying Leonard with an inner willpower that keeps the film at a fever pitch. Carrie-Anne Moss is eerily mysterious as Natalie, whose intentions play a bigger role than you would first consider. Joe Pantoliano gives his character just the right appearance, that which instills a great sense of suspicion for his character, Teddy, who uses Leonard's memory loss to his advantage. <p>My advice to anyone who sees &quot;Memento&quot; is simply this: don't give up on it. Appearances can be deceiving, and this is a fine example of that. Nolan's reversal device enhances rather than diminishes the movie's effects, perhaps because it allows us the chance to give serious thought to the events going on. I entered into this realm of filmmaking not knowing what to expect; I came out with a thought-produced headache of pure satisfaction.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DE1IYJGU5HPW.html">A3DE1IYJGU5HPW</a><br/><p>Strikingly original and gloriously film-noir, Memento is a rare film that finds the perfect marriage between substance and style without sacrificing the tension, drama, and humor in its well-written script.  The first offering from writer-director Christoper Nolan, and adapted from one of this own short stories, Memento engages audiences of all levels in a murder mystery of the first caliber.<p>Leonard (Guy Pierce) is hot on the trail of the man who murdered and killed his wife.  He, too, was injured in the attack, rendering him unable to record any new memories - everything fades after around 10 minutes.  Although he remembers everything until he blacked out, including his wife lying dead on the floor, he has formed no new memories since that time.  This unusual condition has obviously rendered his search somewhat problematic, and Leonard is forced to rely on scribbled notes, photographs, maps, and tattoos to attempt to piece together his investigation.<p>In what has been described alternately as a pedantic, pretentious film-school choice and a masterful way to tell a story, the story is told in 10-minute segments, starting at the END and working backwards.  Therefore, the audience can piece things together in a way Leonard cannot, and our reality becomes totally different from the main characters'.  In fact, one could make the case that Memento is a meditation on the meaning and reliability of memory in and of itself, but I'll leave that one to the scholars.<p>With its legions of fans, it's a wonder this DVD wasn't released with more extras on it.  In fact, there are FOUR different versions of Memento on the world market, and all four DVDs have their strengths and weaknesses.  The American NTSC-format Region 1 version, seen here, has an interview and the incredible Memento website on it (which, I should note, adds to the story, but only look at it after you've seen the movie, because it might spoil some things).  The Canadian version of the film, also a Region 1 NTSC DVD by Alliance, has no extras but has an option where you can select the film's chapters in chronological order, allowing you to see the movie &quot;backwards&quot; (forwards, really).  The French and Belgian version is Region 2 PAL, and lacks all the extras but has an option where you can actually play the film in chronological order, instead of having to go back to the chapter screen 48 times.  And, last but not least, the planned UK Region 2 PAL release (slated to hit the streets on January 14, 2002) will have a director's commentary, the &quot;play chronologically&quot; feature, but none of the American version's extras.<p>This shouldn't surprise people, as Memento was released first in the UK and did significantly better there at the box office than it did here.  However, unless you want to import a DVD from Europe - which requires a DVD player configured not only to play Region 2 discs, but one that can translate a PAL signal to an NTSC signal - the American version will be just fine.  The picture and sound are great, and the chronological mode is basically, as a friend put it, a gimmick.  And, with a movie as good as this, we can live without a commentary.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Guy Pearce and Joe Pantoliano star in this strange and  difficult movie to follow about a man who is hunting for his wife's killer.  Leonard Shelby (Pearce) is obsessed with finding the man who murdered his wife.  However, due to the trauma he suffered during the struggle to save his wife, he now suffers from short term memory loss.  Due to this condition, he's only able to remember names, events, and places for a very short time before he completely forgets them.  He has resorted to taking polaroids, writing notes, and even tattooing messages on his body.<br /><br />Joe Pantoliano stars as Teddy, a person who befriends Leonard and tries to help him find the killer.  But is Teddy all that he seems to be?<br /><br />I found this movie to be very hard to understand.  In reality, it was made backwards; with the ending shown first, and the film then works backwards to the start. It was hard to keep track of the plot, and I really had to "work" to watch the movie and keep track of the events.  Some parts of the movie were good, but when the conclusion came, I was left with just as many questions as I was at the beginning (or should I say end?). Thus, I only recommend this movie to people who have a sharp sense of detail, and who can follow events very closely.</p></br><a href="../users/A16X61RLY1YJL7.html">A16X61RLY1YJL7</a><br/><p>&quot;Memento&quot; can obviously be described in many ways.  I see it pretty much as a mind boggling and extremely original movie that is extraordinarily inventive in how it's told.  From the very beginning or should I say the very end of this film to the end or was it the beginning, this film will lead you in the process of here's how it ended and now let's work out how we got there.  I simply cannot think of any other film that I've seen that has been portrayed in such a manner and oddly enough, it works wonderfully for this thriller.<p>Simply put, to make this movie work, it had to take some of Hollywood's best on screen talents and that is exactly what the producers of this film came up with.  Guy Pearce's performance as a man who cannot make new memories is stunning to say the least.  The ever beautiful Carrie-Anne Moss of &quot;Matrix&quot; fame performs brilliantly, showing that she definitely has talents outside of the &quot;Matrix.&quot;  Joe Pantoliano, most recently acclaimed for his performance during his stint on &quot;The Sopranos,&quot; performs exceptionally well in this film, just showing that he gets better and better with every role.<p>The movie was based on an original short story by Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan took it and ran with it, culminating in this extremely intriguing revenge thriller.  Christopher Nolan most certainly deserves all the praise and accolades he has and continues to receive for the originality of concept in the screenplay and his directing performance of this film.<p>The Premise:<p>Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a rather odd individual who at one point seemingly had the perfect life with his wife yet one day that came crashing down on him when he awoke and found men attempting to rape and kill his wife.  During that incident he struck his head on the wall and has, since that time, not been able to make any new memories.  What follows from there is an intriguing tale in which Leonard, who is constantly taking Polaroid snapshots, making notes and doing self tattoo's to remind him of the &quot;facts,&quot; attempts to seek revenge upon the person responsible for his wife's death...<p>I would definitely recommend this mind boggling, well told revenge thriller for any and all who are interested in this type of film, Guy Pearce's performance alone makes this film one to watch!  {ssintrepid}<p>Special Features:<p>-IFC Interview with Writer/Director Christopher Nolan<br />-Theatrical Trailer and TV Spot<br />-&quot;Following&quot; Trailer<br />-Tattoo Gallery<br />-Director &amp; Cast Biographies</p></br><a href="../users/A1A535W556ROBQ.html">A1A535W556ROBQ</a><br/><p>An unusual look at the loss of identity. Christopher Nolan pieces together the shattered life of Leonard Shelby, very effectively conveying the sense of schizophrenia.  The scenes dovetail a little too neatly, which wouldn't necessarily be the case with schizophrenics, but this is aimed more at allowing the viewer to reassemble the movie.  Guy Pearce puts in another fine performance, capturing the manic edge of the protagonist as he struggles to solve the vexing riddle of his identity.  The movie is more about style than substance.  The story itself is rather simple, but Nolan's sharp editing makes it a movie to remember.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>I have seen a lot of movies and almost always I know what the director is doing.  I know what the actors want to achieve.  I know what the aims of the producers are.  It's all transparent, but once in a while there is a work of pure genius that makes me think I really don't know anything at all.  Memento is such a work.<br /><br />Looking at the premise of this movie, I recall that it can really happen.  Neurologist Oliver Sacks, in his wonderful book, The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat (1986), recounts the story of a man who could only hold the memory of the last thirty seconds or so.  Leonard's condition in this movie is better.  Apparently he can hold in his mind what has happened over the last few minutes.  Also he has the ability to follow a kind of learned routine in which he is able to function by continually writing himself notes.  In the case recalled by Dr. Sacks, the man could not do that.  He could not even remember enough to finish a short conversation.<br /><br />The idea of taking notes to "remember" is something that some Alzheimer's patients are able to do in the early stages of the disease (which may be where Jonathan Nolan got the idea for his short story on which the film is based.)  Sacks recalls such a case in his An Anthropologist on Mars: Seven Paradoxical Tales (1995).  The notes act as the man's memory, just as the notes and photos do for Leonard in this movie.<br /><br />The next question might be, could someone with Leonard's "condition" actually function well enough to get by without being institutionalized or having somebody take care of him on a minute to minute basis?  Leonard says, "Habit and routine...conditioning make my life possible."  He "remembers" to look in his jacket pocket to see where he is living.  Presumably he also does this when he is in his car and has forgotten where he is going and doesn't know where he is.  Presumably he has many notes that we don't see him refer to.  How does he find his way back to his car after going somewhere?  He identifies his car from a photo, but where is it parked?  In the scene where he wakes up next to Natalie, he gets up and goes to his jacket and finds her picture so he knows who she is.  He also finds a picture of her and Dodd.  He somehow "remembers" the significance and writes on the back of her photo, "...she lost someone too.  She will help you out of pity."  How does he remember these things?  Perhaps they are examples of "implicit learning" that "Sammy" was not able to accomplish, what Leonard calls "conditioning."  In implicit learning as opposed to "explicit," we learn to do something without knowing we learned it.<br /><br />Regardless of these questions, this is a brilliantly conceived and plotted thriller, and the acting by the three principals is superb.  Guy Pearce plays Leonard in a most immediate and affecting manner so that we are forced us to identify with him and his predicament.  Carrie-Anne Moss, whom you may recall from The Matrix (1999), is mesmerizing with her sexy, mysterious eyes as the hard-edged and haunting Natalie.  Joe Pantoliano is first rate as Teddy, the wisecracking, cynical and rather annoying undercover cop.<br /><br />But what really makes this a stunning movie is the way it is constructed.  The scenes are presented in reverse chronological order, so that we know the latest action first, and at the end of the movie find out the earlier action.  This seems an extraordinary way to tell a story, but it works.  Incidentally, there's a Seinfeld episode told this way, the one where they go to India for a wedding; and to some extent this technique was employed in Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992).  What makes it particularly effective here is the material.  Leonard, as Teddy points out, is not the same person he was before his wife's death and his injury.  For him the arrow of time has lost its meaning.  Earlier events are just the same as later ones.  Director Christopher Nolan (Jonathan's brother), who also wrote the screenplay, was able to dovetail the action scene by scene as we move backward in time so that what seems true in the beginning becomes different than what is true in the end.  And indeed, like Leonard, our experience of the story doesn't depend on time's arrow.<br /><br />Viewing this the second time (and you may feel a compulsion to do just that) some of the lines that were not funny initially become very funny.  The voice-over in the chase scene with Dodd is an example.  Leonard finds himself running and he says, "So what am I doing?...I'm chasing him....No, he's chasing me!"  Or when Teddy asks about the gun, Leonard says, "Must be his.  I don't think they'd let somebody like me carry a gun."  Or Teddy's line to Leonard, "I've had more rewarding friendships than this--but I get to keep telling the same jokes."<br /><br />The key to the powerful psychological "ending" of the film, where we realize what will eventually happen, occurs when Natalie tells Leonard that revenge is useless because he won't remember it.  He replies, "It doesn't matter whether I remember or not...."  Indeed we see that he really doesn't remember his revenge and that implies that he will...<br /><br />But you really need to see the movie to appreciate the stunning implication.<br /><br />On another level this is a movie about what makes us human.  What would life be like if we lived in an eternal present without reference to the past?  We could be easily exploited by those with knowledge of the past, as Leonard is, but there is a deeper question being asked.  Does life have any real meaning for a person without memory?</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>Small minded people will not like this instant classic. Shot backwards in time this movie will really befuddle and confuse those of us who cannot grasp anything past Freddie Prinze Jr. and Sixteen Candles. Guy Pierce is a shooting star in this business. The story is new, interesting and compelling. Its like putting together a puzzle. GREAT FLICK! GREAT CONCEPT!</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>If you're in a hurry, and have to decide whether or not you'll like tihs film, well, if you want to watch a movie where you don't have to think a lot, this isn't for you. This movie is very deep and you'll need to think a lot to understand it. I actually plan on rewatching it as I only saw it once and I was confused at certain points. This movie might make you feel like tearing your hair out if you don't pay attention to something. Now, for the plot. The movie centers around Leonard, a man that has no short term memory. After he was hit in the head while trying to save his wife who got raped and murdered, he lost his ability to retain new memories. While he can remember everything up to the incident, everything since after around 15 minutes is impossible for him to remember. Leonard thus thinks that everyone is a stranger to him. He takes polaroid pictures of everyone that he has met and writes their name and information that he should retain about them from a past encounter. (if they're a liar, etc..) He also must take pictures of his car, and Inn where he stays. Lenny's goal is to kill the man who raped and murdered his wife. He's got one big gun and will do anything to find this man. He gets assistance from a cop and a good friend. But, he doesn't know who he can trust and life gets very hectic for him. The movie is told in reverse chronological order, going from the end until the start. Not until the very end (start...) of the movie will you understand everything. And then, you probably won't understand everything and will need to rewatch it. This movie is a masterpiece and it's one that I will definitely add to my collection. The ending is very unpredictable and excellent. The movie is a masterpiece as I have said because it's so original. The acting is great notably by Joe Pantoliano. After watching this one, believe me, you'll want to rewatch it over and over to be able to understand everything.</p></br><a href="../users/A18MBO1U4DPY20.html">A18MBO1U4DPY20</a><br/><p>There was nothing boring about this film. I heard this film's indisputable. Yet again, I was left disappointed because it failed to thrill me. No I'm not void of any sort of exaggeration so as to speak but the concept seemed cramped up. I waited for the movie to start but somehow it never does. By the time the end was around I looked at my watch facing the unavoidable feeling of being lost. Many say the fact that this movie is so difficult to understand makes it "exciting" and "re-watchable". I'm not watching this again in any case because I didn't find it worthwhile the first time around. Now This is a film a lot of people would swear by. However , it left me uninspired but ensured about the number of similar films that would prop up in the near future.<br /><br />Am I over critical? Maybe. I just choose to be so with Memento. I suggest you give this a watch to know for yourself.  There's no review that can actually help you find solid on this movie. Atleast not mine.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EENLV6OQ3DYM.html">A2EENLV6OQ3DYM</a><br/><p>"Memento" is the ultimate movie lovers flick.  It incorporates the best aspects of classic film noir (circa early 1950s) and turns it on its head with the clever trick of presenting the narrative in reverse.  The movie starts out at the end, with brain damaged Lenny taking revenge by killing the man who raped and killed his wife and who left him brain damaged.  But did he get the right guy?  As the film progresses, it becomes more and more unclear.  When the truth is revealed, the "ending" takes on a whole new meaning.<p>Guy Pearce, the "other" Australian actor in "L.A. Confidential" emerges from Russell Crowe's shadow with an outstanding performance as the tormented Lenny.  Backing him up are fine efforts "Matrix" vets Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Ann Moss, who are Lenny's main antagonists.<p>Well scripted, well acted, and challengely put togather, "Memento" was the best American movie of 2001.</p></br><a href="../users/A109LWN9DUGPDP.html">A109LWN9DUGPDP</a><br/><p>imagine this buy the time you finish reading this sentence you will have forgotten why your even sitting at your computer.this is what Guy Pearce character is like all through this movie,he suffers from a type of memory loss due to a tragic accident.this memory defect only prevents him from remembering what happens now,everything before the accident he does remember.the movie involves him trying to find out who attacked him and killed his wife...i'm not givin nothin else up,oh i will tell you this the movie plays backwards,its hard to descibe but it relly draws you into the film making you fill part of the story as lost as the main character but picture this you suffer from this condition which only ables you to remember for a quick minute, a man calls you tells you the mans name who killed your  wife all you have to do is remember the information he is telling you case closed you are drasticly looking for a pencil to right down the killers name when all of the sudden the man on the phone is gone you keep saying...remember..remeber all the sudden your dog lets out a bark..as you turn to your dog you forget you had even spoken to someone on the phone much less someone who had told you the killers identity.frustraiting heh.The director Christopher Nolan is the greatest screenwriter in hollywood,now also on my top directors list.nothing irritates me more that this film was only nominated for two academy awards(screenwriter and editing)which should win hands down but what about best diretor or best film they would definately be my choice this year.anyway if you only watch one movie in your entire life watch this one</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>This is a intricate crime story, and somewhat confusing to watch.  The main character, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce)  has lost his short-term memory.  His long-term memory is intact.  He can remember details and everything that happened before his "accident", but cannot retain what he has done or said five or ten minutes after doing anything (anterograde amnesia).  He is unsure of who to trust, who are his friends, what is true and his only goal is revenge, finding the man who raped and murdered his wife.  He is focused only on justice.<br /><br />He is well-built, thin, handsome, wearing expensive suits, driving an expensive jaguar, but lives in ratty, run-down motels, paying cash for all he wants.  He is a former insurance investigator, very aware of his handicap, explaining to people in great detail why he has trouble knowing them or remembering what he told them.  He has to rely on others, his index cards, photos, and skin tattoos to latch on to his past thoughts and observations.<br /><br />Leonard has psychological issues as he fights and struggles to interpret the evidence he finds and keeps on index cards and hiding places.  The film starts from the endpoint, the murder of "Teddy" known as John Edward Gammell.  The film re-winds and stalls in the present at times -  it is complex and confusing to refigure the frames and realize how the meaning of events changes.  The bad and good criss-cross as the story unfolds.  It seems the color scenes are shown in reverse order and black and white are chronological.  The two sequences come together at the end of the film.<br /><br />Leonard meets a woman named Natalie after finding a note in his clothes.  Natalie at first is angry and resentful because she identifies Leonard with the clothes and car of her boyfriend Jimmy.  After being educated about Leonard's short-term memory she uses him to drive a threatening man out of town.  She offers to run the license plate on Leonard's latest tattoo to help in his investigation.<br /><br />The ending is somewhat of a surprise if you can figure out the movie's timeline.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Ingenious thriller dares to be intelligent and different, and gets away with it. Since the audience sees most everything from Leonard's disoriented perspective, the movie requires more careful attention than your average thriller. Happily, "Memento" is suspenseful enough to command it. Pearce makes an ideal Leonard, a desperate man skirting insanity, but Pantoliano steals the show as the shady, enigmatic Teddy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>Memento was sadly under marketed. It could have done better with more screens and more marketing as it has mass appeal. Nevertheless, it's been a hit via DVD sales. The film is set up in such a way that you are the protagonist suffering from not remembering what happened last. The sequences are brilliant. I was very sad when Chris Nolan didn't win for Best Original Screenplay for the Academy Awards. The story is original, engaging and thought provoking.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ.html">A2BZWG2LTJZGBQ</a><br/><p>Let's see, how to begin this review-- how about at the end and move slowly toward the front?  You see, that would be a propos for this film, which takes precisely that approach to tell the story.  It moves from end to beginning, with each scene that the audience sees being the scene which took place before the previous scene.<p>Well, kind of.  There is also another similar plot line which runs in true time and is mostly the main character, Leonard (Guy Pearce) talking to someone on the phone about a strange mental condition.  No worries about telling the two plot lines apart, because this alternate plot line is shot completely in black and white, while the plot line that runs in reverse is done in color.  The movie alternates black and white scenes with color scenes, which leaves us completely confused for a while.<p>Not really such a bad thing for this movie, because that's exactly what Leonard feels.  He was a detective living a normal life, when his wife was brutally raped and murdered.  He walked in on the attack and was slammed into a wall.  He developed a strange condition from this injury.  He can form no new memories.  Anything that happened to him before the attack is crystal clear.  Since then, any encounter he has fades from memory within seconds.<p>To combat this, he uses his body as a kind of billboard, tatooing various facts about the killer all over himself, so he won't forget them as he hunts down the killer of his wife.  He also keeps pictures of everyone he meets and writes notes on the backs to keep straight whether they can be trusted.  Some of the people he meets may not be his true friends, but we don't know that, we are along for the ride.<p>The two main characters Leonard meets in the movie are Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) and Natalie (Carrie Anne Moss).  Both characters are not who they seem at first, and one wonders if either can truly be trusted.  Kudos must go out to Pearce, who gives an excellent performance as the brain damaged Leonard.  You can sense his acceptance of the reality of his life, yet see the despair just underneath the surface.  Magnificent performance.<p>Camera work is another plus here.  A couple of neat tricks for us.  The opening scene is of someone being shot with a pistol.  The scene goes completely in reverse, with the bullet going back into the gun and the blood crawling  up the wall.  This sets the scene for the type of storytelling we will be seeing.  Also, I mentioned the two separate storylines.  Watch toward the very end for these to come together.  It will take a careful eye to spot the moment when they do.<p>The main accomplishment for Christopher Nolan is the ability to structure the film in this way and still leave us a surprise at the end.  Or beginning.  Whatever.  By the time the credits roll, we learn that everything that has gone before may not be completely accurate.  Is that the message?  That memory itself is unreliable?  Perhaps.<p>Finally, the DVD itself.  Wonderful.  The image is crisp and clear.  The DTS sound is awesome  The discs are loaded with extras although I admit they are a pain to access, particularly disc 2.  You may have to go to a website to fully explain how to access everything.  My favorite feature is the one which lets you watch the whole movie in real time  The black and white scenes all actually happen before the color scenes in real time.  This is evident when you utilize this feature.<p>In short, this is a must see.  I promise, you will not see anything like this for a long time.  The script, acting, and execution are near flawless.  Go grab a copy of this and get ready to watch it at least twice!</p></br><a href="../users/AZ5250G2U795I.html">AZ5250G2U795I</a><br/><p>As great as this movie is...it's not for everyone. <p>That being said, I'll tell you why I see it as a WOW! Christopher Nolan has created a piece that is unmatched in it's originally and is on par with 'The Usual Suspects' in terms of storytelling at it's finest. The script is tight, and the performances (Guy Pearce...if you haven't heard of him yet, trust me...you will!) are solid.<p>The fact this film is told backwards gives you an intimate 'bond' with the protagonist, in that you can't remember what happened before either, and this adds a dimension that few films can project. But, you can't 'leave' for a second. If you have to do anything, pause it, because little clues are left all throughout the movie, and the different way the story is told can also leave you feeling lost if you miss some of it.<p>This is a true gem of a film that it's a shame it didn't get more buzz early on.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>Christopher Nolan's superbly-constructed mystery has the advantage over average thrillers with a startingly- original plot. The whole &quot;backwards&quot; premise works amazingly well, and is one of the best ideas ever devised for a film, reminiscant of PULP FICTION. Guy Ritchie is Sammy, a man who loses his short term memory when his wife is murdered and he gets attacked. Joe Pantiliano (THE MATRIX) is Lenny, a guy who may, or may not be Sammy's friend. The search for the elusive &quot;John. G&quot; provides for some chilling moments. Sammy's condition forces him to tattoo himself with notes like &quot;Never answer the phone&quot;, which racks up the tension and pushes the limits of audience's cerebral limitations. One of those films which you have to watch two or three times to fully understand it and get the whole idea, it's endless in it's creative concepts, leaving the viewer surprised and somewhat confused. Director Nolan does the best with the inventive tricks and piecing together the plot machinations. And extra kudos for the editor, not to mention the brooding score throughout the film's running time. In short, it's a fantastic film, and deserves to be placed high in the great &quot;Film Noir&quot; masterpieces.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>As I sit here writing my 700th Amazon review, I am struck by the sheer number of movies I have watched and reviewed on this site.  Remarkably, however, I somehow missed this incredible piece of film-making until now.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, "Memento" tells the story of an amnesiac who cannot remember short-term events.  He knows who is and basic tenants of his life, but the day-to-day details reset from time to time.  Thus, this film is devoted to him trying to avenge his wife's killing and putting together the pieces of his confusing identity.<br /><br />There is not other way to describe this movie apart from saying there are few like it.  The closest comparison would be to "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind", but "Memento" is better at that game.  The story is told in such a unique fashion that it will keep you guessing (but in a good way) until the very end.  The acting is also solid and makes you truly care about the 2-3 core characters.<br /><br />Perhaps the greatest compliment I can give this film, however, is that it accomplishes the feat of bending the mind yet ultimately creating a remarkably cohesive overall story.  I was taken on a psychological adventure and given an ending worthy of the journey.  You won't be left hanging, that is for sure.<br /><br />Thus, "Memento" is now firmly ensconced on my "Top Films" list.  There's nothing it fails at, while succeeding at so many other things.  If you (like me) have waited this long to view this gem, it's time.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LOBF0ZU1HE0S.html">A3LOBF0ZU1HE0S</a><br/><p>Playing in rewind, this film tells the story of ex-insurance investigator Leonard (Guy Pearce) with an uncontrolable case of &quot;short-term&quot; memory lose lives for only one purpose, to find and kill the man who raped and &quot;murdered&quot; his wife, using tattoed notes on his body as his only source of progress. An deniably interesting and gripping thriller loaded with many mixed elements of film noir, astonishing performances and an uncountable number of twists and turns that it packs a punch right in the viewers face.<br />This DVD edition is a delightful treat for such an outstanding film. Razor sharp picture and crystal clear sound, informative IFC (Independent Film Channel) interview with director Christopher Nolan, theatrical trailer and TV spot, trailer for director's earlier feature &quot;Following&quot;, interesting and somewhat creepy tattoo gallery and director and cast biographies.

Guy Pearce (Ravenous) plays a man named Leonard Shelby who is searching for the man that raped and murdered his wife. That alone is pretty much the plot, but what sets Memento apart from other revenge themed thrillers is the fact that the film moves backwards event wise. The film starts out from the end and works it's way back to the beginning, letting the viewer find out not just how something happened, but why it happened. Memento is presented in this form due to the fact that Leonard suffers from a condition received when his wife was attacked that stops his brain from making new memories. Lenny can't remember faces, names, locations, or anything else on his own so he takes Polaroid photos, writes endless amounts of organized notes, and even makes himself home made tattoos. Pearce is simply unbelieveable in his role as the tortured soul Lenny, while Joe Pantoliano (The Matrix, tv's The Sopranos) almost steals Pearce's thunder as Teddy, a man who may or may not be on Lenny's side. Carrie-Anne Moss (another Matrix alumnus) plays a sympathetic soul to Lenny's crisis while hiding ulterior motives, and she gives a knockout performance as well. Memento requires more than one viewing to fully understand the complex storyline, but once you do you'll be left with your jaw on the floor. All in all, those looking for something delightfully different and intelligent should definitely give Memento a well deserved look.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>`Memento' is probably one of the only films that must be watched from beginning to end, no if ands or buts, in order for it to be even enjoyed.  I mean this with all sincerity, if you miss the first thirty seconds you're screwed.  That said, when caught from the very beginning `Memento' is also one of the most enjoyable and richly rewarding films to be watched.  It's a true stunner of a film, from plot to execution, and is one that will instigate lots of post-watching conversations.  The acting is top-notch, especially from the likes of Guy Pearce (looking like a scraggly Brad Pitt covered in interesting tattoos) who just blew me away here.  I've never really been a fan of Pearce.  In `L.A. Confidential' I felt he was the weakest link and pretty much everything else I see him in I just don't feel him, but here he just soars.  The direction of the film is a thing of beauty really, and Christopher Nolan has pretty much established himself as one of our greatest new-wave directors.  He truly gets into his material and delivers this masterful story in a very unique way which proves to be the grandest embellishment.<br /><br />The film centers around Leonard Shelby, a man who's lost his wife to rape and murder and in the process lost his mind.  He has set out to find the man who did this and punish him.  The movie opens with him killing a man named Teddy.  This is the end of the film, or I should say the end of the story.  Teddy is, for the sake of discussion, the man who raped and murdered Leonard's wife.  The film them jumps back in ten minute segments until we get to the beginning of the film, or should I say the beginning of the story, where we uncover who Leonard came to this conclusion.  What makes this direction so interesting is that the film gives you just enough information to keep you guessing.  It tells you just a little bit and then takes you back and fills you in, leaving new doors open for interpretation before taking you back again and filling you in.  It's truly a masterpiece of a film and executed so well it's a real shame the academy snubbed Nolan his directing nomination.<br /><br />Like I mentioned, Pearce is a spectacle in this film, but there are two other performances within `Memento' that deserve attention.  For one we have Carrie-Anne Moss' who plays a barmaid who is helping Leonard for reasons yet to be uncovered.  Is she really concerned with Leonard's plight or is she using him for her own selfish gain?  Moss surprised me here because I'm really not familiar with her work aside from `The Matrix' and a film like `The Matrix' doesn't really allow the actors to shine, but here she delves into the meat of her character and delivers a great performance.  The real star though, the actor that outshines them all, is Joe Pantoliano of `The Sopranos' fame (yes, that's Ralph).  As Teddy Joe is spot on and delivers an exciting, fresh and completely absorbing performance.  It's funny because my wife and I are HUGE `Sopranos' buffs and when we saw `Ralph' we just about died (since his character was one we loathed from start to his finish) but here he completely sheds his `Sopranos' persona and delivers a separate performance altogether and it paid off wonderfully for him.<br /><br />`Memento' is a film for the ages.  It's one of those movies that may not be your cup of tea, and for that I understand, but really, there isn't much to dislike with this film (that is if you catch it from the start).  There are so many films where one is advised to sit back and turn your mind off but here I'm telling you to sit up and turn your mind on because `Memento' is the type of film that will keep you thinking, keep you guessing, and in the process keep you completely entertained.  The end, or should I say the beginning, plays out in a wonderfully inventive way that is unexpected yet ultimately rewarding.  It packs a huge `wow' factor and I just love that about this film.  I don't want to say too much because I don't want to spoilt he surprise, but just be aware that it's not what you'd expect, and that's a beautiful thing!</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Rarely have I watched a film that demanded that I pay such rapt attention to detail. Its series of segments, progressively reveal more of what happened but in backwards order. I had to expend a lot of mental energy comparing the events in each segment and piecing together what I thought actually happened. This method of filming alone is challenging but especially so given the main character's mental limitations. It is worth energy to figure out though!<br /><br />For those who don't know, "Memento" is a story of a man who loses his wife in a rape attack inside their home, pledging that he will track down a murderer for revenge and peace of mind. The main problem is that Lenny (Guy Peirce), after the attack, was left with a problem in that he cannot retain any long term memories. Well that's one brief summary of how to look at it, but there are others. Indeed this film is excellent and played with my emotions, emotions of sympathy, anger and questioning my own morals and judgments. Peirce is exceptional as the lead, and the characters that come into contact with him also give fine performances (notably Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano). Focusing on the problem of losing a memory after approximately 15 minutes, we begin to appreciate just how frustrating Lennys plight is.<br /><br />The film is beautifully shot and the editing and photography is even better. The best part: the film starts at the end and works it way to a middle point. That's because when the film comes to its end you really don't know if it's the beginning since you don't know what Leonard (Guy Pierce) did before arriving at an isolated place. This film can really be seen as reminiscent of the film style of Film Noir. It uses black and white scenes to give that off as well as the characters in the film constantly sucking Leonard further down into this world where he has no idea who and what to believe, including himself and the things he's done. Not only that but all the characters, yes even Leonard who is our protagonist, has a dark side of human nature to them. And that's what Film Noir is, exposing the dark side of human nature. The film has such a great Psychological deepness and by all means breaks the conventional art that goes into filmmaking. It really was a shame this film wasn't nominated for best picture. It greatly deserved that award and Nolan greatly deserved best director for it. Bottom line: Flat-out brilliant film-making and story-telling. One of the best films I've ever seen. I don't throw high ratings around but this one deserves 5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CZICCYP2M5PX.html">A1CZICCYP2M5PX</a><br/><p>Leonard `Lenny` Shelby (Guy Pearce), a man who has a short memory spam, the only thing, he could remember seeing his wife being murderer and ever since, he can`t remember the next day and even the next few minutes before.

My observation of the books selections is that a few of those movie I didn't really have to see but "Memento" is one that lived up to the billing.  I admit to being scepticle at first because it seemed that I was watching the movie backwards in sequences.  I wondered what kind of movie it would be since much of it was rerun scenes.  However, I realized that this was a unique movie that keeps the viewers guessing (although I can imagine that some may have taken it back to the video rental without watching the whole movie).  The retelling of the various scenes created impressions as well as doubts and that really came together at the end.  However, the ending was not typical either.  It left us wondering what is the reality.  Along the way there were at least two or three scenes where I had to double-check to see if what I saw was real or not.  "Memento" has a plot but it seems less important to the film than the twists and turns it takes us on.  In the end, I was pretty dazed by what I had seen but I knew it had been an exciting ride.  I suggest most people should watch "Memento" at least once (excepting small children and pregnant women).  I don't know that I will watch it again but I'm sure there are a lot of people who do watch it over and over.  I wouldn't be surprized to hear them say they see something new each time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>Memento starring Guy Pearce is such a brainy and sophisticated movie. I wasn't sure what to except when I watched it but I was completely fascinated by this little gem of a film. Leonard (Pearce) suffers from short term memory loss, the film goes backwards, it is not too confusing, just concentrate and you'll figure out the twist ending (I guess that would make the ending the beginning). Leonard takes poloraids of all the things he will forget later on. The film is shot in black and white and color. I highly recommend checking out Memento, I highly recommend checking out Memento. Just a little short term memory loss humor for you, enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Christopher Nolan<br /><br />Cast:  Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano, Mark Boone Junior, Russ Fega, Jorja Fox, Stephen Tobolowsky, Harriet Sansom Harris.<br /><br />Running Time:  113 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for violence, language and some drug content.<br /><br />There are a lot of excellent movies whose scripts rewrote the rules of cinematic storytelling (the Oscar-winning "The Usual Suspects" and "Pulp Fiction" are two good examples).  "Memento" deserves a place among those films: it's the most complex, original, innovative, intriguing achievement to hit the big screen in a while.  "Memento" looks like an ordinary film noir, having all the conventional elements (femme fatale, unreliable characters, ambiguous protagonist/narrator, bleak ending), until is fatally strikes you with its originality and audacity, making you unable to stop watching.  Director Christopher Nolan manages to pull off a rare feat in the film business these days by taking the entire industry by storm with his incredible intelligent, disjointed thriller "Memento".  While many films have since tried to imitate its taut script and superb execuation, it remains one fo the most unique and thought-provoking pieces of the past decade.<br /><br />From the beginning you realize you're not watching the usual thriller: the reversed opening sequence is a fascinating narrative choice, and even more fascinating is the director's decision to tell the whole story backwards, with each separate scene ending where the previous one began. Thanks to this trick, the audience is as confused as the movie's main character, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), a peculiar DIY detective who wants to find the bloke who raped and killed his wife (CSI's Jorja Fox). While attempting to save his wife during the attack, "Lenny" sustained a head injury and has lost his short-term memory, so every new event is gone from his mind after 10 minutes. He has to go on with his life by taking notes, snapping Polaroids and putting tattoos all over his body. He also gets some valuable help from a cop, "Teddy" (Joe Pantoliano), and a barmaid, Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss). But should he really trust them, given he can't almost even trust himself due to his neurological condition.  Nolan (who screenwrote the film as well) knows how to build up the tension, as well as add emotion, with the touching parallel story of Sammy Jankis (Stephen Tobolowsky), a man with the same disease as Leonard.<br /><br />Both Pearce and Tobolowsky are superb as the two troubled men: the former makes you feel as uneasy as he does almost immediately, and he's got some really ace lines ("How am I supposed to heal if I can't feel time?"); the latter, on the other hand, is heartbreaking, his experiences make us wanna cry before the film's over. Pantoliano and Moss are very impressive too, their true intentions remaining unclear until the end.  Nolan beautifully intertwines the present and the past, linking events together like a detective putting all the clues together until the thief is found.  While "Memento" is thoroughly composed with its intertwining plot, the film's great strength can also be considered it potential flaw. The confusion that is inevitable can make it difficult for some to follow, especially for those who are used to a film flowing over them in a passive way. Memento requires you to exercise your brain and even when it is all over certain questions will still remain and further viewing is essential.  Of course, the central paradox of the film should not be forgotten, this is a revenge story but of course the character has now way of remembering the actual crime, his memory is gone and the memory of the act of revenge will also be a fleeting one.  Nolan's story and the ensemble cast's acting are outstanding, but a mention also has to go to the cinematography and soundtrack that both helped greatly to create the oppressive mood that pervaded throughout he film and is essential to generate the sense of fragility that exists in Leonard's connection to the world.  An intelligent, profound, and supreme addition to the genre.  One of the best films of the decade thus far.</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>'Memento' is a film that I approached skeptically.  I'd heard nothing but good things, pretty much, but it sounded gimmicky, and like precisely the sort of slightly arty, slightly innovative film that stupid people and mainstream critics will see and proclaim it genius, and, worse yet, somehow imagine that their love of this film make them smart. (I'm no indie/intellectual film snob, mind you, but I can usually spot a sacred cow from quite a distance)  And I suppose I was right, partially, as looking at the review for this it's apparent that more than a few dummards are claiming 'Memento' to be the greatest, most original film ever.  And, yeah, they don't know what the hell they're talking about, but they manage to be almost right anyway.  Still, on top of being a first-rate thriller (well, more or less a thriller anyway.) 'Memento' has got a real human interest angle, and prods into some ideas with regards to reality and perception.(It may not be incredibly revelatory, but few films inspire the mind at all.)<br /><br />I suppose I should summarize the basic plot: Leonard Shelby is on a quest to avenge his murdered wife.  Unfortunately, during the attack he was injured, and can no longer make new memories.  Thus, he's got grope through the present, with only notes and tattoos and instinct to guide him towards his goal.  As you would imagine, this can get pretty damn complicated.  Personally, I don't think the whole backwards chronology gimmick is all that hot of an idea, in and of itself, and it's certainly not original to this film.  Of course, Nolan redeems it through the second conceit, which is that Leonard, has no short-term memory, thus placing us in his shoes, as much as is possible via the reverse chronology. (i.e. he doesn't know what happened in the previous scene, chronologically and neither do we.)  Normally, this would just be a cheap gimmick, an easy way for the director/writer to keep us in the dark, and create cheap, obvious ironies, but now there's actually a legitimate, defensible reason for presenting the film this way.<br /><br />It would be inappropriate to discuss plot details, though suffice to say that the other characters in the film well understand how easy it would be to manipulate a person with no memory.  Still, clever and intriguing as the plot is, the character of Leonard is perhaps the most interesting part of the film.  Personally, I find him to be a great, tragic and highly sympathetic figure.  He's particularly compelling to me, as I find revenge to be a rather romantic notion.  I'm sure many will disagree with me, and say that it's meaningless, but that's precisely the point.  This is heightened by the fact that Leonard will never know if he gets his revenge, not inside anyway.  But, the principle of the thing is enough to drive him.  Of course, we eventually learn that not everything is the way it appears, but this only undermines it all slightly, as there is still abundant reason why he should want to kill John G.  And, Leonard's condition is so hopelessly screwed up and existentially twisted that you can't help but feel for him.  Living completely in a void is a scary thing, and the film helps you  really reflect on these things in a way you probably haven't before.<br /><br />Performances are all excellent, though special note goes, again, to Guy Pearce as Leonard.  He's in a really complicated spot, as there really no guidebook for how to play this role, as he's got to continually be in a sorta semi-confused state, reacting to a scene as he perceives he should, but not really feeling why. (or vice versa)  Nolan's direction is stylish and sharp, though it doesn't draw as much attention to itself as it might have, which is probably a good thing.  The score is effective too, lotsa low-key, pulsing stuff, but still charged with emotion.<br /><br />Yeah, it's a great movie.  Clever plot + emotional resonance.  Usually you only get one, if that.<br /><br />Grade: A</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZS82R4RC0I2N.html">A1ZS82R4RC0I2N</a><br/><p>An interesting movie with a captivating (although not all that original) premise, &quot;Memento&quot; is a true cult film, one that tries to offer something slightly different and personal. The concept is good, but after the first half the movie gets a bit repetitive and unsurprising, culminating in a mildly disappointing ending. Still, the acting is top notch, since Guy Pearce truly is an excellent choice for the lead role, delivering a subdued and intriguing performance. Directing Christopher Nolan suceeds at creating a gripping and moody atmosphere with enough suspense and interest, grabbing the viewer`s attention. That`s particularly relevant, since in this story every detail counts. Well, the plot per se is hardly anything new, so what sets &quot;Memento&quot; apart from most thrillers is the way its story is told. As a whole, this effort is worthwile and appealing, yet it`s more cerebral, cold and distant than enjoyable, entertaining and warm. It`s also a bit too depressing, since the final revelation makes one look at the characters from a new (and darker) perspective. Still, &quot;Memento&quot; is a remarkable movie about human nature, lies, trust and love, providing a clever (perhaps too clever, by the way), unusual and witty mistery. It`s unfortunate that, at parts, it carries more style than substance, but it`s a solid cinematic experience nonetheless. <p>Worth a look. Or two, to confirm if it all makes sense after all (some details are contrived, yet overall it works).</p></br><a href="../users/A18IK6YI6T3RK2.html">A18IK6YI6T3RK2</a><br/><p>This is a great film, I saw it at the theater a few years ago and was blown away, I really liked how the film goes forward and back, it felt fresh and original.  Guy Pearce is fantastic in this film, he is such an underrated actor, people often tell me I look like him, so it's weird to watch him in this role, because his character is so confused and lost, it really resonated.  It was so cool how he wrote things on his body so he would remember, you could feel his desperation, really a great performance.  I always suggest this film when people say that they can't find an original film.

The whole world, you discover, is subjective. Short-term memory loss means you can lie to your later self and Christopher Nolan, who wrote and directed. makes the most of the possibilities. For one thing, there are no big-name stars (Carrie-Anne Moss from the _Matrix_ movies is as close you come) so you can concentrate on the story, and on the confusion that inevitably strikes the first-time viewer. And there are some problems: For instance, who the hell is Dodd? Can you believe Teddy's explanation? Inevitably, as in life, there are no absolude answers. And, as with _Pulp Fiction,_ _Mulholland Drive,_ and a few other recent non-linear films, you'll enjoy this one more as you re-watch it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LZVU5SRRM3VX.html">A1LZVU5SRRM3VX</a><br/><p>The movie begins with a bang (literally and figuratively), and the viewer is immediately sucked in to the story, which, for the most part, works its way backwards in small segments, giving the viewer brief moments of continuity so that the viewer has some sense of chronology in this tale told in reverse.<p>This was my first experience with Guy Pearce in a leading role, and he was impressive, accurately portraying Leonard Shelby's sense of hopeful but frustrated determination to overcome his short-term memory loss.  Unlike Dory in Finding Nemo, however, Shelby's condition is not used for comic relief.  Instead, the story weaves its way in and out of Shelby's in-the-moment sense of reality, bringing him into contact with a variety of interesting characters, most of whom viciously manipulate him.<p>Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Ann Moss (of Matrix fame) both play supporting roles, as does CSI/ER veteran Jorja Fox.  But the story primarily focuses on Pearce's Shelby, and his desperate attempts to find his wife's killer...and himself.<p>Although I have only watched it once, it would probably be as interesting to view again now that I know what to look for.  Not sure I would want to own it, but a very interesting story that compels you to follow it to completion.</p></br><a href="../users/A23QOAXJSWIBS6.html">A23QOAXJSWIBS6</a><br/><p>Be prepared to watch Memento several times.  There is much more going on than may meet the eye at first glance.  Director/Writer Nolan is doing much more than telling a tale in an innovative fashion.  He is making statements about reality and human experience whether he intended to or not.<p>The narrative loop in the film, far more than a gimmick, unseats us from the comfortable theater seat and makes us sit up an take notice.  By the end of the film, we have (hopefully!) figured out what exactly is going on to Leonard/Lenny.  It's a shame he has no clue -- or does he?<p>I've always thought Guy Pearce was a great actor, and this is easily his best work to date (with LA Confidential a close second).  Joe Pantoliano and Carrie Ann Moss are brilliant in the supporting cast.  I just wish this film had garnered more acclaim than it did.<p>Unfortunately I haven't found any of Nolan's work since to be all that memorable, but he has proven himself to be both insightful and capable of crafting a stunning piece of ground-breaking cinema.<p>One wish for the DVD -- on Nolan's &quot;Following&quot; we had the option of watching the film &quot;in order.&quot;  I really wanted that option here.

I won't go into details because I don't want to reveal too much but it is a great way to spend a night with friends and a big bowl of popcorn.

My opinion is my own and I hold no ill feeling to those that enjoyed this movie.  In fact I enjoyed it myself for the most part, but in my opinion, I walked from this movie with nothing.  It was entertaining to see how the movie progressed.  The story that unfolded backward was ingenious, but rough getting started.  The performances were excellent, as was the script.  Guy Pearce, Cary-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano all carry the movie so well.  My problem is that the entire movie gets you to sympathize with the character and by the end, you're not sure what to think.  I don't want to give much away by saying anymore.  The movie is obviously leaning toward being artistic, and that's fine.  And I do know something about art, I was an art major in college.  I guess my beef is that the movie is dark and down in it's tone, and many people will not find it entertaining in that respect.  Movies in general are supposed to entertain and with that said, if you don't find dark, moody, twisted and surreal entertaining, you probably won't find this all that much fun to watch.  Myself, I tend to sit on the fence between artistic and entertaining and this movie leans too much toward artistic.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>The hype about this film is the plot twist however it does not turn out to be half as good as what people where saying about it.

The film is mostly shot in reverse and that is a very cool concept that is committed to the screen in a very daring and remarkable way.

Once it unfolds towards the end, you really see how the rest of the film came together...if you can remember it.  Problem with this kind of way of showing and also its benefit is that sometimes you forget how Leonard got to a particular place or why he was there, making the benefit of repeated viewings.<p>If you wanna work your brain for a change, instead of the &quot;jerking off the ego&quot; movies that have come out recently, give this one a watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>As I left the theater, my mind clouded with all of the images and story of the film, I realized that I had seen a great addition to the film noir canon.

I get up and leave the packed independent theater.<br /><br />I have heard a lot of good things about "Memento", the new noir film from writer - director Christopher Nolan, and I am not disappointed. Movies like "Memento" are perhaps the hardest to write about. I have to be careful to not give away anything. Anything at all. If I do, I will rob a moviegoer of a potential surprise.<br /><br />Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is in the middle of a mystery. He is trying to find the man who raped and murdered his wife (Gorga Fox). Leonard has a problem that further complicates this mission. The trauma of his wife's death has robbed him of any short-term memory. He can remember who his wife is, how to drive a car, etc., but anything that occurs to create a new memory will be forgotten. Leonard must rely on notes, tattoos on his body and Polaroids of his friends, enemies, places he lives, etc. He can't talk to people for very long, because he will ultimately forget who they are. He can't talk to people on the phone, because he has to see their eyes, a skill he learned as a former insurance investigator. During his investigation, he meets Natalie (Carrie-Ann Moss) and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), two people that may or may not be his allies.<br /><br />If "Memento" were laid out in a typical chronological fashion, it would be an interesting film with some good performances. Christopher Nolan, the writer and director, decided to tell the film backwards. The first indication of this is the first shot of a Polaroid undeveloping. We see a picture of a man's body in the corner of a deserted room. The hand holding the photo shakes it a few times, it becomes lighter. Shakes it a few more times, and so on, until the picture pops out of the camera. We then see the climax of the film first, shocking us into the film's different reality. As the film rewinds, we see Leonard slowly unraveling the mystery that leads up to the climax and the detours that he takes along the way. Each segment of the story is just a few minutes in length, the length of Leonard's memory. This helps the audience really feel for Leonard's plight. We essentially have the same problem Leonard does. We don't know what happened before, so everything is new to us, just as it is to Leonard. This construction is really brilliant and it is a testament to the skill of Nolan that the film does not seem as gimmicky as I just described it. We quickly buy into the world he has created and it seems natural.<br /><br />To provide a break from the rewinding story, Nolan inserts an ongoing telephone conversation between Leonard and an unseen caller between each of the short segments. In chronological fashion, Leonard recounts the story of his most important case as an insurance investigator, the case of Sammy Jankis (Stephen Tobolowsky), a man with a very similar case of short-term memory loss, and his wife, Mrs. Jankis (Harriet Sansom Harris). The story of Sammy Jankis provides a very human aspect to the story and allows us to see Leonard as a normal human being. The story also helps us to understand Leonard's plight.<br /><br />Guy Pearce is simply phenomenal. In each brief segment, he has to start each by figuring our what is going on, trying to figure out if the people around him are helping him or should be avoided. It doesn't sound like the character would allow a lot of time for development or allow the audience time to identify with him, but Pearce makes it happen. Because he is used to the problem, he knows to act quickly. He makes the character work hard throughout to find the source of the mystery. The scenes when he is on the telephone, recounting the story of Sammy Jankis also help to humanize the character. Much of the flashbacks present a different Leonard, providing a nice counterpoint.<br /><br />Carrie-Ann Moss is very good as the required Noir femme fatale. She has a simply amazing couple of scenes in the middle of the film during which we quickly see who she is, what her role is and how deeply Leonard's problem affects him. She is a very strong character. Joe Pantoliano plays Teddy, Leonard's ally. Leonard plays along with Teddy despite the Polaroid in his pocket labeling Teddy a liar. Teddy is a very complex character who likes to talk and he talks a lot. During his many conversations, he also takes advantage of Leonard's problem.<br /><br />"Memento" is a very memorable film, sure to delight you with its twists and turns.<br /><br />The house lights go down as the last minute stragglers try to find seats.<br /><br />I read the newspaper, waiting for the film to start.<br /><br />I buy my ticket very early. I know from the buzz that I need to buy my ticket early. A lot of people will want to see the film tonight.<br /><br />I do not mind paying full price for my ticket.

(...)</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>What a pretentious mess..<br />I was forced to watch this tribute to pain by a relative who thinks this film is &quot;so wonderful and innovative&quot;. FAH! How can a film be boring and irritating at the same time? The plot revolves around some doofus trying to find his wife's killer, but not like Mannix. He stumbles about in a haze due to the fact that he has no long term memory: &quot;Who are you? Where am I? Oh yeah, I wrote down here somewhere..&quot;<p> It gets worse, everything is shown backwards, so we see what happens to the goofball in the end, which is the beginning, but it does'nt matter. By the end of the film, which is the beginning, you really don't care about anyone in this forgettable film. I was asking myself the same questions as the main character. And I wanted a drink.<p>A complete waste of time.</p></br><a href="../users/A32DTCFBBB9WIV.html">A32DTCFBBB9WIV</a><br/><p>THis is not about originality. It's about bad taste. Another bad movie featuring Guy Pearce, after the atrocious RAVENOUS. Simply dislike it.</p></br><a href="../users/A192KEPM0HW6AC.html">A192KEPM0HW6AC</a><br/><p>A friend recommended "Memento" to me, because I am very much into suspense thrillers. However, I approached it with a wary eye, as it was recommended to me by the same friend who suggested I see "The Usual Suspects."<br /><br />"Memento" is unmomentous for the same reason "The Usual Suspects" was: It requires hanging all one's emotions as a viewer on the gimmick peg. For example, I stopped watching "The Usual Suspects" about 3/4 into the movie.<br /><br />"It was just, frankly, boring," I told my friend. "I lost interest."<br /><br />My friend screamed at me that I missed the big shock ending, in which Kaiser Sose is explained. I would've loved that movie, I was told, if I was simply patient enough to wait for the big payoff at the end.<br /><br />I countered that Hitchcock movies have big shock ending payoffs at the end, too, but that Hitch *kept the viewer interested* with taut suspense, a great plot and finely-honed dialogue.<br /><br />So, I went into "Memento" with a little more patience. I stuck with this one until the bitter end, and it was indeed bitter.<br /><br />The gimmick in this movie, which I picked up a third of the way into the inaction, is that it is shot in reverse time. Its hero, played by Guy Pearce, who must have graduated from the Keir Dullea Space Odyssey 2001 school of cardboard acting, suffers from a memory disorder. He can't remember what happened the day before, so he must reconstruct it physically -- with Polaroid shots and body tatoos -- to create a history for himself, so as not to go totally insane.  He also is tracking down a killer (a device borrowed from Hitch). When he catches the real killer, he can exonerate himself.<br /><br />But, the story is told with painstakingly pedantic scenes and horribly fake understatement. I had no sympathy for the hero at all, and if it weren't for some very good acting by Carrie Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano, I probably would have tuned out early.<br /><br />The problem with "Memento" is that it tries to hard to be a film noir for our times, while ignoring just what it was that made those movies so memorable. Combing my mind, I cannot even think of one lesser film noir that was less entertaining than "Memento," and no, I'm not forgetting "Johnny Stool Pidgeon" or "Detour" either. As far as "The Big Sleep," "Out of the Past" or "White Heat," forget about it! "Memento" is so far out of their league that it is an insult to compare this dreck with those great classics.<br /><br />Watching movies requires, as we all know, the "willing suspension of disbelief." And I've got plenty of that suspension: It keeps me well entertained even by such formulaic movies as "Dodgeball" and "Mr. 3000." When it comes to movies, I admit I am guilty to being an escapist.<br /><br />But, when something is just patently ridiculous that it defies belief, that's where I draw the line. In order to reconstruct his identity, Pearce has had tatoos embossed all over his torso. Okay, that's fine. I'll buy that.<br /><br />However, just look at those tatoos: The producers obviously wanted them to look so cool that they went whole hog that they had a tatoo artist not just scrawl utilitarian messages on his body, but recreate the Sistine Chapel according to Marilyn Manson across his chest and arms. This one affectation comes off as more pretentious than the entire final script for "American Beauty."<br /><br />Of course, there are no scenes of Pearce actually getting a tatoo. They would be too laughable.  However, I can imagine what one scene from the cutting room floor might look like:<br /><br />PEARCE: I need this tatooed.<br /><br />TATOO GUY: What does it say?<br /><br />PEARCE: "He has a gun, and he's coming for you."<br /><br />TATOO GUY: That's a lot of words, but if I just use navy blue, I can do it for you pretty cheap.<br /><br />PEARCE: Cheap? I have $1000. Go to town, man.<br /><br />TATOO GUY: Where do you get all that money? I mean, you live in a fleabag hotel, and with no obvious means of support.<br /><br />PEARCE: I got it from Chris Nolan, my director. He said I've got to look "killer cool." Use this CD cover as an example for your fonts.<br /><br />TATOO GUY: Wow, that IS cool. Motorhead's "Sacrifice." Lots of cool Goth script.<br /><br />PEARCE: That's right. We're going after the MTV crowd: Nolan told me not to worry too much that there's nothing really cool about me at all, at least not in the Robert Mitchum or Elvis sense. Nolan said "image is everything," so with these tatoos, and working out at the gym all day, so that my pecs look really ripped, I can't lose.<br /><br />TATOO GUY: Bitchen, dude.<br /><br />Of course, there is a bona-fide shock ending by the time this mess wraps up, but you'll figure out that Pearce is the killer long before he does.<br /><br />If you have the intestinal fortitude to sit through this half-hearted art-school film, I recommend Edward Dmytryk's 1965 classic amnesia thriller "Mirage" as the perfect antidote. A tightly-shot thriller in the Hitchcock tradition, Gregory Peck doesn't need pecs nor tatoos to deliver a convincing performance. Instead, he uses Peter Stone's crafty dialogue. He also does something else that has eluded Guy Pearce.<br /><br />He *acts* .</p></br><a href="../users/A3A4WQL80WOTMH.html">A3A4WQL80WOTMH</a><br/><p>I only watched half of it.  I tried, but this is a boring excercise in trying to figure out what's going on in a story that starts at the end and brings you back to "what happened" by taking back to the beginning scene by scene in reverse order.  If those scenes had been intereting in themselves maybe I'd have stuck it out, but for the hour that I sat through, this movie was a big yawner.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZLROGIL2V7GV.html">A2ZLROGIL2V7GV</a><br/><p>It's finally here.  The wait is over.  Now, you can get the special edition of "Memento," which is loaded with tons of cool features and extras.  Not only that, but the movie is also remastered, both in picture and sound.  Is this special edition worth getting?  You betcha!<p>The picture quality is outstanding!  It's hard to believe that this is a low-budget film.  Somebody wrote a review claiming that this wasn't in widescreen.  I don't know what kind of version that person got, but the one I bought is very much widescreen, so don't let that throw you off track.  To have this movie be presented in full screen would be a crime!  I also noticed how much better the sound quality is.  I haven't had a chance to watch it in DTS, but I'm sure the quality is top-notch.<p>Before the special features, a little recap of what the movie is about for those who are new to this movie.  Leonard Shelby has a condition.  He has no short term memory.  Everything fades for him.  If he talks to someone for too long he'll forget who that person is and what they were talking about.  Ten or twenty minutes later he'll have no recollection of what happened earlier on.  The twist: he's looking for the man who raped and murdered his wife.  Now, Leonard is armed to the teeth with important tattoos to help him remember important info, and is also armed with a camera to take pictures of those who he encounters.  He only lives for revenge, wanting to find the identity of a killer he can't possibly ever know for sure.  The second twist is that the movie is told in REVERSE order.  So, be warned; this is not a movie you can just sit down and eat your popcorn and relax.  This is a movie that forces you to think.<p>Now the special features; there's tons of them.  You get to hear director commentary, which is very cool.  On the second disk is where all of the special features lie, but you can't just click on them.  OH NO!  You've got to work to earn them.  Solve brain teasers and puzzles and answer questions very much like a psychological test.  Very cool!  If you're a fan of the movie, you won't mind the work.  Some of the features are a behind the scenes feature, two trailers, pictures, the short story by Nolan's brother, Leonard's journal, and more.  And there are hidden features I have yet to find.  But I did find one that I think will interest you very much.  Know what it is?  Do you?  Yes, there is a way to watch the movie in CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER!!!  It's hidden, so it's not an option you can just select.  It's pretty easy to do.<p>NOTE: IF YOU WANT TO DISCOVER THE FEATURE FOR YOURSELF, DO NOT READ THE NEXT PARAGRAPH!!<p>Here's what you do: 1)make sure the second disk is in. 2)click on the clock image that is below the gun. 3)answer the series of questions anyway you please; when in doubt, go with "C." 4)you'll be asked to put four images in chronological order instead, put them in BACKWARDS order. 5)need help? here's the order: third image, fourth image, first image, and then the second image. 6)movie will begin to play in chronological order. congrats! enjoy!<p>I was very pleased with this special edition of "Memento."  It was like watching it for the very first time.  If you're a big fan of the movie, then get it as soon as you can.  You will not regret it.  I know I didn't.  This special edition surpasses the original in every way.  See it to believe it.</p></br></body></html>

With its complex cast of characters, intricately concocted plot, and excellent direction and pacing courtesty of the great John Huston, it has stood the test of time to become a defining moment in cinema.<br /><br />Bogart stars as Sam Spade, a down on his luck, hard boiled private eye. When a lovely woman (Mary Astor) approahces him for help in finding a suspect who he considers dangerous, Spade's partner is put on the case. When his partner turns up along the dead along with the suspect he was trailing, Spade now becomes intent on finding the killer. He finds out that the woman who turned to him for help is a liar, but a relationship developes nonetheless. Spade learns through a variety of suspects (played by legendary character actors such as Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet) that The Maltese Falcon, a Spanish artifact from the time of of the 1500s', is the key reason behind his partner's murder. Each of these sordid characters will stop at nothing to get their hands on it, and this all leads to a shocking conclusion.<br /><br />"The Maltetse Falcon" is a wonderful film that features every actor at the top of their game. This three disc special edition comes with great sound and picture quality as well as a stunningly impressive array of bonus features. Highly recommended to all film fans.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>John Huston was one the greatest directors Hollywood ever had.

Sam Spade and partner Miles Archer seem okay, until Ms. O'Shaughnessy (played by Mary Astor) enters the office. Behind her but unseen, a handful of high-living lowlifes, make live disagreeable for Spade & Archer. Until hard-boiled, hard hitting Sam Spade gets the right answers, double-crosses and betrayals high-lite the implied action. Finally, the "stuff that dreams are made out of" emerges in the form of a black falcon--"The Maltese Falcon".<br /><br />The story is from a book by Dashiell Hammett. The film is directed by John Huston, and remains a template for private detective yarns and will for years to come.</p></br><a href="../users/AB0GGIQBNB36Q.html">AB0GGIQBNB36Q</a><br/><p>Hahaha, some have said this a greatly overhyped film noir. Reeeeeeeally, THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATEST NOIR  MOVIES OF ALL TIME. Humphrey plays detective sam spade, and plays as most Private detectives were during that time. Alittle shady, yet still on the side of the law. And Sam gets caught up with The Maltese Falcon case, it starts with Mary Astor's character trying to get sam to tail her. Since she believes's she's in danger, so spade puts his partner on the job. And he buys it, which doesn't make spade happy. In the end, Sam puts the killer away, I guess alot of people's problems with it might be that there's not awhole lot of explosions. It's a mental excercise, yes it's not really hard to figure out the players. But it is fun to watch them try to double cross each other, including Spade. I would give this film more than five stars, Plus this movie has Peter Lorre in it, as well as Sydney greenstreet.</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>Dialogue rules in this ferocious onslaught of double-cross, after double-cross, and shadowy figures with twisted codes, and non-existant morals. Bogart's version of the tougher than nails, Sam Spade, is the screen detective that all others were subsequently measured by for decades, and Mary Astor's treacherous widow is sublime. Though the actual violence in this film classic is at a minimum, the threat of it permeates the entire movie.<br /><br />The film quality on this transfer is pretty decent ( though not so on the other two films included ). This is definitely a must for noir lovers, or just film lovers in general.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>If I see a better film on DVD this year (2007), it's going to have to be quite something to beat this. Based on the novel by Dashell Hammett Bogart plays Sam Spade (Private Detective), a role he was born to play. He and his partner are hired by a woman who claims a man is keeping her and her sister separated. Soon after this things spiral out of control.<br /><br />The screenplay by John Huston is magnificent. The dialog is sharp and there isn't a wasted breath. Mind you Huston's direction is equally good and as for the the cast, well perfection is the only word I can think of. Peter Lorre as the oily Joel Cairo has never been better than he is in this film. Sdyney Greenstreet is fabulous as Kasper Gutman. Amazingly at the age of 62, and weighing close to 300lbs this was Greenstreet's debut film performance. Finally there is Bogart, an icon certainly, but also a great actor with a huge amount of screen presence. What surprised me watching the film again recently is how small Bogart seemed, but checking the records it turns out he was 5' 10.5".<br /><br />The film is currently ranked 57th on the IMDB (www.imdb.com) all-time top 250 films, which for a film that is 66 years old is pretty amazing. However when you watch it you will find out why.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>The Maltese Falcon (Three-Disc Special Edition)~ Humphrey Bogart is one of the best detective movies of all time. The character Sam Spade is a legend and every detective ever since has been modeled after this. Bogart is absolutely stupendous in his role and he should have won some kind of award for it. I might even say that the academy award would have been justified for this movie. The music is minimal but it is very effective. The script is very well written and I would have to say it is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. I give it 5 well deserved stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>In the Maltese Falcon the audience can observe Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) as he is trotting through the city of San Francisco trying to figure out what people are hiding. The plot thickens as the audience learns that greed is the generating factor for deception and that the Maltese Falcon is invaluable.  Deceptions then lead Sam into a spiraling plan made by someone, but who? Overall, the Maltese Falcon can be illustrated as a maze that entangles itself repeatedly, since one lie is built upon another lie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TV6SBCWT7P8S.html">A2TV6SBCWT7P8S</a><br/><p>The Maltese Falcon is one of those often imitated but never surpassed films. It has set the standard for years for detective movies, but its dark atmosphere, fantastic script, and gripping tension have never really been achieved (possibly The Big Sleep, another Humphrey Bogart mystery, comes close) since. <p>The plot is rather complicated, and to explain it in detail would be to give away the point of the movie. Still, the movie mainly deals with two elements: one is a seemingly innocent girl whose appeal for help to Sam Spade (Humphery Bogart) and his partner leads to several mysterious murders, and the other is the web of crime relating to the priceless Maltese Falcon. As the movie progresses, the relation between the two elements becomes clearer and clearer...but to say anymore would be to spoil too much! <p>But even though the plot is very interesting and thrilling, what really makes this film special is the atmosphere, the script, and the acting. The black-and-white cinematography is great, and the scenes, which are kept shadowy, give the movie a chilling, dark atmosphere - it really is a film noir. <p>The script is fantastic, and Humphery Bogart brings the wisecracking, tough Sam Spade to life. He is the perfect incarnation of the streetwise, cunning detective - always ready to fight, but smart enough to not have not do so very often. In another of Humphery Bogart's films, The Big Sleep, in which he plays a similar character, a girl tells Bogart that he is not very tall. His response is typical, and is the epitome of his attitude - yes, he admits, I'm not very tall, but "I try to be," he explains. His comment says it all: he is not tall, but he projects a fantastic tough guy image nonetheless. Anyhow, his performance is wonderful - it is his quintessential role! <p>The other actors, especially the girl he deals with, are good as well. All in all, this is a must-see film - and it is OK for the whole family, although it may be a little hard to follow for younger children. I don't know how else to recommend this...get it soon!</p></br><a href="../users/A1IOJE0W1NXOSE.html">A1IOJE0W1NXOSE</a><br/><p>Humphrey Bogart is the definitive Sam Spade in this adaptation of the Dashiell Hammett book.  He is tough, savvy, quick-thinking and ruthless, while being surrounded by dangerous characters.  He is approached by a young woman, played by Mary Astor, who says that her sister has been taken away by a man that she wants Spade to find.  As the movie progresses, Spade discovers that she has created a tangled web of intrigue.  She, a young-looking Peter Lorre, and a Sidney Greenstreet character are in search of the priceless Maltese Falcon statue and will pay any price to acquire it.  Spade matches wits with them in a seemingly effortless way, but does pay an emotional price at the end.  The dialogue is snappy and the plot moves rapidly in this classic, which has definitely stood the test of time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Humphrey Bogart, Sidney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre form a powerful nucleus for this fine film.  The ambitions and greed of a cast of eccentric characters are focused like a laser beam on the title object and its up to Sam Spade to sort out both the players and their Machiavellian plots and to dispense justice.  Great dialogue and one tense confrontation after another make this a real winner.</p></br><a href="../users/AR2DE47VCY1C8.html">AR2DE47VCY1C8</a><br/><p><p><br />Director: John Huston<br />Format: Black &amp; White<br />Studio: Warner Studios<br />Video Release Date: February 1, 2000 <p>Cast:<p>Humphrey Bogart ...

That must have been the case here.  All involved, including Bogart himself, had reputations for being somewhat persnickety to deal with.  Here, though, they seem to mesh and groove together with incredible fluidity.  In a book written about this film, they actually had a rip-roaring good time with one another between takes...and it comes through in the finished film.<br /><br />Of course, we start off basing this movie on one of the greatest detective stories of all time.  Dashiell Hammett's book was criticized in its day for being too complex and hard to follow.  Well, judge for yourself.  I'm always intrigued to show this movie to someone who's never heard of it or the book on which the film was based, and see whether they have trouble following the plotlines.  I'd guess that 8 out of 10 can do it without much difficulty.<br /><br />There is a setpiece in the book which did not make it into the film.  Since the film follows the book's plotline quite strictly, this omission is a little unusual (although it must be conceded that it added nothing to moving the plot along).  Hammett has Spade telling the story of a man named Flitcraft who disappears.  His family hires Spade and Archer to track him down, and they find him in another city.  As Hammett tells the story, Spade is completely engrossed in telling this story and, in context, it explains so much of why Sam acts the way he does in this tale.<br /><br />Every time I see this movie I imagine Humphrey Bogart, acting what became the hallmark and defining role of his career, delivering this soliloquy to Bridget O'Shaughnessey.<br /><br />But then, in the 1940s. they did not have DVDs, nor did they have any idea of what a "Director's Cut" would be.<br /><br />If you've never seen this wonderful movie, pop it in, relax and enjoy one of the best stories ever put on film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>A noir works best when it is fueled by the characters within it. Maltese Falcon could almost be a textbook example of how to achieve that.<br /><br />A pitch-perfect, credible plot with more twists than an Elvis concert sits atop a taut script that creates bizarre characterizations from ear-bending conversations.<br /><br />All of which are brought together to create a darkly intriguing world whose selfish players cannot get enough trying to screw each other over.<br /><br />Highly recommended classic that stands up to repeat viewings.

It's a gloriously seedy, dark path through a tangle of lies, murders and and thefts, all centering on the legendary<br /><br />"Shoo her in, darling." A beautiful woman (Mary Astor) comes into Miles & Archer's detective agency and claims to be looking for her sister, who has supposedly gone off with a guy called Thursby.<br /><br />Just an ordinary case? Wrong. Later on, Miles is shot, followed by the mysterious Thursby -- and since Spade (Bogart) has been dallying with Miles' wife, he's a prime suspect. After being grilled by the police, Spade visits the client -- now calling herself Brigid O'Shaughnessy -- and gets the real story out of her. Or not. Seriously, this woman lies like most people say "Hello."<br /><br />Things go from bad to worse when Spade is kicked around by little weaselly Joel Cairo and the sinister yet hearty Fat Man. Like O'Shaugnessy, they are searching for the priceless Maltese Falcon, a jeweled bird statue covered in black enamel. Who has the Falcon? Who stole it? Who killed for it? And who might kill again to get it back?<br /><br />The San Francisco of "The Maltese Falcon" is a smoky, shadowed world, where men and women from across the world ruthlessly pursue priceless treasures. In fact, it's fortunate that this film was filmed before the advent of color, because the black-and-white film just adds to the murky, bleak atmosphere.<br /><br />The plot is a little hard to follow at first, since there seem to be two unrelated mysteries that don't seem to have anything to do with each other. But as Spade unravels lies and motives, the subplots are twined together and the story becomes truly brilliant. The dialogue is sharp and witty ("I've been bad, worse than you could know." "You know, that's good, because if you actually were as innocent as you pretend to be, we'd never get anywhere").<br /><br />And the small cast put the "anti" in antiheroes -- everybody is painted in dark shades of gray. Bogart's growly Sam Spade is strangely charming, and you end up liking him even though he's not much better than the crooks. Astor plays a floaty fluffy femme fatale who has a nastier side, Peter Lorre is wonderfully creepy as Joel Cairo, and Sydney Greenstreet is pleasantly sinister as the Fat Man. The only really GOOD person seems to be Effie.<br /><br />Sharp, dark and very twisted, this is a fantastic mystery full of twists, greed and the ultimate anti-heroic detective. This is primo noir!</p></br><a href="../users/A3P1508PZ0UADD.html">A3P1508PZ0UADD</a><br/><p>Classic, one of Bogart's best.  They don't make them like this anymore.  Highly recommended.  I didn't want the other movies, but had to buy the package set to get The Maltese Falcon.  Wish Amazon would have offered the movie as a stand-alone.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z.html">A1GGOC9PVDXW7Z</a><br/><p>"Huh?" answers the trivia question: "What is the last line in the 1941 film, THE MALTESE FALCON?"<br /><br />John Huston's adaptation was actually the third Hollywood take on Dashiell Hammett's Sam Spade novel.

I've put off seeing this movie for I don't know how long.  For some reason I had fixed in my mind that I wouldn't like it--BUT boy was I wrong.  Bogart shines like the star he was.  He commands every scene his in and is able to whip out this fast talking piece with convincing believability.  One thing for sure, you have to pay attention or you can easily get lost.  The only angle I thought that could have been cut is the whole you love me I know you do stuff.  When Mary Astor start spitting that nonsense I started wondering when did anyone have time to fall in love in this movie.  Great script, good direction.  And all around winner in my book.</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>The Maltese Falcon, 1941 film<br /><br />The film opens with a view of the old port of San Francisco. Miss Wonderly visits the agency of "Spade and Archer" for help in rescuing her sister from Floyd Thursby. Miles Archer volunteers to take care of her. A late night phone call to Sam Spade tells of Archer's murder. Spade visits the scene, then returns home. The police show up to tell him Thursby was also killed. Archer's widow shows up to see Spade about the death, another complication. Miss Wonderly calls to see Spade and tells him a little more truth. Spade agrees to help her, but he needs more money. Back at the office Joel Cairo visits to offer a reward for providing a statuette of a black bird.<br /><br />Hammett's novels tell of the tricks of a private detective. Take a cab to an apartment house, enter, then leave by the back entrance to shake a tail. Spade returns to tell Bridget O'Shaughnessy (aka Miss Wonderly) about the visit from Joel Cairo; this upsets her. They meet at Spade's place, but the police show up for a surprise visit. Spade talks them out of being arrested. Then Spade visits a hotel to see Cairo and notices the young man who works for the Fat Man. Spade keeps gathering information from the people he meets. After meeting with Gutman (aka Fat Man) Spade feigns anger to create a crisis. This leads to another meeting and we learn about the value of the black bird. But Spade was doped by his drink; he is no longer needed to recover the black bird.<br /><br />This fast-paced adventure continues with no dull spots. The meeting in Spade's place brings out the facts previously hidden. Spade plays along with them to uncover the truth. But there is a hitch in their plans for great riches. Gutman quickly recovers from his disappointment and returns to his search for the imagined riches. But Spade has detected the truth about Archer's death, and can resolve the mystery and solve the crimes. This shocking ending was hinted at in prior scenes. One flaw in this story is the need for experienced crooks to be fooled by an enameled lead statuette. Or was this Hammett's view of the share owners of the 1920s? The film shows a long-gone America. Carrying a pistol was almost as common as smoking in public places. Most people walked. Technical considerations avoided the cable cars of Frisco. Those $1000 bills were about a year's pay for the average worker in 1929. They were abolished by Nixon's 1971 devaluation of the currency. Wouldn't they be useful today?<br /><br />This film made a leading man out of Humphrey Bogart; previously he played villains as in "High Sierra". Note how Spade studies each person as they tell their tales, like a hawk watching a dove. The Webley-Fosbery Automatic Revolver seems to be a symbol or clue to the murderer. It looks like a revolver, but is really a self-loading or automatic pistol. What you see is not what you get. Had Hammett thought of something more shocking that couldn't be written in those days? Note the right to keep and bear arms in San Francisco then.</p></br><a href="../users/AYZLXLVMJGTJV.html">AYZLXLVMJGTJV</a><br/><p>The film is very clever and kind of twists you up a bit at the end. You have to pay attention to really capture the essence. Some greedy lowlifes want to get the Maltese falcon which apparently was part of the treasure given to the Knights Templar from the kingdom of Spain. Does anybody remember the Knights from the Da Vinci Code. Anyways, detective Sam Spade gets involved. His partner gets killed early on in the story and he hooks up where his partner left off. The cops think he killed his partner and most everybody sees him as a good for nothing. He plays it like that, trying to play his hand to the highest bidder, acting as if he wants the money, that thats all he is concerned with. The lowlifes project that on to him, because thats what they see in themselves. The cops don't trust him. He seems to be a one man show but is it for the money or for the need to see justice proclaimed. Bogart does a real good job in his character and the film noir is never better! The dialog is snappy and intelligent. I'm glad I am watching these movies. I thought the classics would be sort of silly, and old fashioned but this film shows real clarity.<p>Lisa Nary</p></br><a href="../users/A1BJOEQSRX2IBM.html">A1BJOEQSRX2IBM</a><br/><p>This is one of the best detective mysteries ever, great acting all around, Humphrey Bogart is superb as the fast-talking Sam Spade, Peter Loore and Sydney Greenstreet, two of the greatest character actors, give superb  performances as the villains. Mary Astor and Elisha Cook Jr. are also good.  Great dialogue and a twisted story-line, courtesy of Dashiell Hammett. John  Huston couldn't of had a better directing debut, he then went on to become  one of the greatest directors of all time. The confrontations between  Bogart and Elisha Cook are amusing and the story keeps you hooked all the  way through. Great film-noir elements and superb casting make this one of  the all-time greats. Extras: that's Walter Huston (John Huston's father) as  Capt. Jacobi. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 10!</p></br><a href="../users/A51IK68MWKV5R.html">A51IK68MWKV5R</a><br/><p>The three-disc special edition of the 1941 version of The Maltese Falcon contains some very interesting bonus features: the two previous adaptations of Dashiell Hammett's novel, the first also called The Maltese Falcon (though it was renamed Dangerous Female for TV in the '50s to avoid confusion), and the second titled Satan Met a Lady.<br /><br />Since the 1941 version (directed by John Huston and starring Humphrey Bogart, Mary Astor, Sydney Greenstreet, and Peter Lorre) is the one considered "definitive," it's not surprising that relatively few viewers realize that was actually Hollywood's third adaptation of Hammett's classic detective novel.<br /><br />Satan Met a Lady (directed by William Dieterle and starring Bette Davis and Warren William), is by all accounts a disaster (a very loose adaptation by screenwriter Brown Holmes, who co-wrote this version), but the first Maltese Falcon, filmed in 1931 by director Roy del Ruth, is a terrific alternative for viewers who love the story and would just like to watch a different take on it. (Both films are faithful to the source, with few changes.)<br /><br />The main difference in tone comes from Ricardo Cortez's portrayal of Sam Spade. Cortez's Spade is much more of a ladies man than Bogart's. In fact, the opening scene of the movie shows a woman leaving Spade's office, adjusting her stockings (later, he is shown picking up sofa cushions from the floor). His roving eye (and hand) also includes his secretary, Effie. Una Merkel plays Effie as if she's not only a willing participant in these shenanigans, but is also quite aware of Spade's other dalliances -- including partner Miles Archer's wife Iva (Thelma Todd) -- and thinks it's funny.<br /><br />That lightness extends to Cortez, as well. He goes throughout The Maltese Falcon with a huge smirk on his face, as if everything going on around him is endlessly entertaining. And I can imagine why. When Ruth Wonderly (Bebe Daniels) comes into his office, he probably already knows she'll end up naked in his bath, in his bed, and in his kitchen. Cortez displays just the right mix of sleaze and charm.<br /><br />But the only other actor who gives anything close to as interesting a performance is Dudley Digges as Kasper Gutman. Digges gives the role real grease, making him a truly unlikeable antagonist (Greenstreet always charmed even in his most villainous roles, much like Claude Rains, his costar in Casablanca). And I was very pleasantly surprised to find that Dwight Frye (Renfield in the Lugosi Dracula) shows up briefly as Wilmer Cook. He doesn't say much, but just try to look away when he flashes those psychotic eyes.<br /><br />This Maltese Falcon was made three years before the enforcement of the Production Code that would whitewash movies for the next thirty years. Thus, there are instances like those mentioned above that did not make it into the "cleaner" 1941 version. One major effect this had is when Mary Astor's Brigid O'Shaughnessy proclaims to Bogart's Spade, "I thought you loved me," it doesn't make a whole lot of sense based on what preceded. Here, when Wonderly (who never reveals herself to be O'Shaughnessy, a plot point I always thought was unnecessarily confusing anyway) says the same words, they hold real meaning.<br /><br />Though quite entertaining in its own right, the 1931 Maltese Falcon is undoubtedly destined to remain forgotten in the shadow of its later remake. I recommend it, however, due to its lighter and sexier tone, handsomer leading man, and almost completely different approach to the same source material. Fans of pre-Code cinema will especially enjoy it, even if they generally prefer a little more noir in their detective stories.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ.html">A1D2C0WDCSHUWZ</a><br/><p>He may not look like a "blond Satan," but Humphrey Bogart became the ultimate Sam Spade in "The Maltese Falcon," the classic movie adapted from Dashiell Hammett's noir mystery. It's a gloriously seedy, dark path through a tangle of lies, murders and and thefts, all centering on the legendary<br /><br />"Shoo her in, darling." A beautiful woman (Mary Astor) comes into Miles & Archer's detective agency and claims to be looking for her sister, who has supposedly gone off with a guy called Thursby.<br /><br />Just an ordinary case? Wrong. Later on, Miles is shot, followed by the mysterious Thursby -- and since Spade (Bogart) has been dallying with Miles' wife, he's a prime suspect. After being grilled by the police, Spade visits the client -- now calling herself Brigid O'Shaughnessy -- and gets the real story out of her. Or not. Seriously, this woman lies like most people say "Hello."<br /><br />Things go from bad to worse when Spade is kicked around by little weaselly Joel Cairo and the sinister yet hearty Fat Man. Like O'Shaugnessy, they are searching for the priceless Maltese Falcon, a jeweled bird statue covered in black enamel. Who has the Falcon? Who stole it? Who killed for it? And who might kill again to get it back?<br /><br />The San Francisco of "The Maltese Falcon" is a smoky, shadowed world, where men and women from across the world ruthlessly pursue priceless treasures. In fact, it's fortunate that this film was filmed before the advent of color, because the black-and-white film just adds to the murky, bleak atmosphere.<br /><br />The plot is a little hard to follow at first, since there seem to be two unrelated mysteries that don't seem to have anything to do with each other. But as Spade unravels lies and motives, the subplots are twined together and the story becomes truly brilliant. The dialogue is sharp and witty ("I've been bad, worse than you could know." "You know, that's good, because if you actually were as innocent as you pretend to be, we'd never get anywhere").<br /><br />And the small cast put the "anti" in antiheroes -- everybody is painted in dark shades of gray. Bogart's growly Sam Spade is strangely charming, and you end up liking him even though he's not much better than the crooks. Astor plays a floaty fluffy femme fatale who has a nastier side, Peter Lorre is wonderfully creepy as Joel Cairo, and Sydney Greenstreet is pleasantly sinister as the Fat Man. The only really GOOD person seems to be Effie.<br /><br />Sharp, dark and very twisted, this is a fantastic mystery full of twists, greed and the ultimate anti-heroic detective. This is primo noir!</p></br><a href="../users/A1C58YXM2A30CY.html">A1C58YXM2A30CY</a><br/><p>I got to rewatch this as I was reviewing my VHS collection.  From MGM/UA comes the VHS version in "glorious black and white."  The cassette plays the original film as-is, with no clean-up, complete with little crackles and dust motes, etc.<br /><br />Bogart plays Sam Spade, one of his best roles that nearly typecast him as the hard-boiled film noir private detective.  San Francisco 1941, complete with Bay Bridge and Bush & Stockton Streets.  At that fateful corner, Sam's partner Archer bites it.  But he never pulled a gun and his coat is buttoned.  Did he know the killer?<br /><br />And who is the mysterious woman who is a pathological liar and overacts to Sam?  Sam sees right through her ("you're good -- now you gonna walk around and start straightening everything out in the room?").  She's in over her head.<br /><br />Peter Lorre plays the slimy Turk who insists on searching Spade's office even after Sam punches him out for pulling a gun on him.  What nerve!<br /><br />Sydney Greenstreet is the rich businessman who in oh so smooth and suave way, takes Spade at his word and seemingly takes him into his confidence -- until a Mickey in the drink changes Sam's mind.<br /><br />Wilmer is an interesting character, makes like a gangster and could be the fall guy for the gang's murderous ways.<br /><br />As a detective story, the plot moves steadily if a bit slowly towards its completion.  I already knew who the killer was, having watched this a few times already, so I get more and more impressed with the style of 40s filmmaking whenever I watch it.  Mary Astor is the strange lady with strange purpose.<br /><br />Looks like the director was trying to work in the Archer's wife who was in love with Spade thing, but they let that drop, the only real plot hole in the whole affair.<br /><br />Overall, great film that would set up Bogart for life.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>... I'm not sure why.  The Maltese Falcon should be enshrined in the pantheon of great movies for several reasons.  First, it is almost an exact interpretation of the book - right down to the little detail of the way Spade is amused at his own hand shaking after confronting Gutman.  Second - the performances.  Bogart immortalized two of the 20th century's greatest detectives - Philip Marlowe and Sam Spade.  Peter Lorre is unforgetable as Cairo and there is the inimitable Sydney Greenstreet as Gutman.  True, I didn't picture Brigid O'Shaugnessy as Mary Astor, but that's a trifle here.  This is a gem of cinema that allows us to travel to a time, place, and STYLE that doesn't exist anymore.</p></br><a href="../users/A2P49WD75WHAG5.html">A2P49WD75WHAG5</a><br/><p>John Huston's 1941 remake of The Maltese Falcon became the definitive version as it opened the doors for the film noir genre.  And noir movies opened up with The Glass Key, The Postman Rings Twice, Key Largo, and Dark Passage.  The dark mood of these movies were put to best effect with black-and-white film, with dimly lighting in nighttime scenes reflecting the grimness of the genre.<p>Sam Spade becomes involved in the search for the title artifact with the introduction of three characters--Brigid O'Shaughnessy, Joel Cairo, and Kaspar Guttman.  All three are involved in one way or another with the title object.  The cynical Spade though, shows his loyalties to no one, but the one who pays him the most.  He is also quick to strike out at anyone menacing him, such as a pistol-wielding Joel Cairo or Wilmer, a hired gun.  His steel heart extends to his relationship with his partner, whose wife Iva he has an affair with, and even that is passionless.  Only Ebbie, his loyal secretary with a nice personality who can handle Spade, gets the less hard part of his hard edge.<p>However, two murders entangled themselves in the web.  The first is that of Spade's partner Miles Archer, who charmed by Brigid, offered to shadow a man she wanted followed.  The second is Thursby, the object of his hunt.  And Spade's caught up also because he is suspected of his partner's murder due to his affair with Iva, and he's got to fend off the police and D.A.'s office.<br />Certain camera shots get great mention, such as the shadow of the "Spade and Archer" sign cast from the window to the floor.  Another is the bright spotlight effect shown on Miles's surprised face as he gets shot.  And the way the camera focuses on the Fat Man's belly shows the weight he has, both physically and in terms of power.  The lights and shadows enhance the costumes as well.  Most of the characters are dressed in black.<p>This was the film that pushed Bogart to film legend status, making it his biggest success since The Petrified Forest.  Ahead of him lay greater roles such as Rick (Casablanca), Phil Marlowe (The Big Sleep), Allnutt (The African Queen), Queeg (The Caine Mutiny), and Linus Larrabee (Sabrina).  <p>Mary Astor (Brigitte) needed this kind of film, especially to counter the 1936 headliner scandal made over her sexual exploits with playwright George Kaufman, made public with the splashing of her diary across newspapers.  Sydney Greenstreet as the plummy but dangerous "Fat Man", i.e. Guttman, Peter Lorre as the slightly effeminate Cairo, and Ed Begley Jr. as the neurotic gunsel Wilmer all add to this classic.  He speaks in a low but quivering and menacing tone:  "Keep on riding me, they'll be picking iron out of your liver."<p>Cinematically, a classic, and remember that line, "the stuff that dreams are made of."</p></br><a href="../users/A3GN9I0UYV08LC.html">A3GN9I0UYV08LC</a><br/><p>A gallery of High-living lowlifes will stopp at nothing to get their sweaty hands on a jewel-encrusted falcon .

Compared to the deluxe packages that Universal, Criterion, are a peculiar desecration of a vaunted film legacy.<br />Case in point: "The Maltese Falcon". Arguably the greatest detective film ever made, Warners at least releases it with a decent video transfer. Unfortunately, the audio synchronizing is off during the last 15 minutes of the movie (by a second but it's still noticable) and I wasn't able to access all the people on the "Cast and Crew" menual though I enjoyed the "Trailers of Humphrey Bogart" section, it would have been nice if Warners spent the money to create a documentary history of the film the way they did on Universal's "Casablanca" release.<br /><br />Much ink has been spilt praising "The Maltese Falcon" so I won't go into any panegyrics here. It's just a shame that Warners doesn't take this market seriously enough to put more care into the DVD releases of their finest films. High Quality Transfer .

There is really no extraordinary action going on in this film and no grand finish. It is basically a character study of Sam Spade, the definitive hard-boiled private detective and to a lesser degree of Gutman, one of the villains - and there are several - played by Sidney Greenstreet in his first film appearance. Why is Sam Spade so fascinating when he has so many bad personality traits and character flaws? Because nobody is this tough! Not until Dirty Harry came along 30 years later did the silver screen exhibit someone with such a knack for laughing in the face of danger. Gutman's cartoonish armed front men are just a joke to Sam Spade, who easily disarms them, often makes them look ridiculous, and then just hands the loaded weapons right back over to them without a second thought. In fact, at no time during this film is there a predicament for which Spade doesn't have a quick and cool response. Mary Astor is also great as Brigid O'Shaughnessy, the femme fatale who comes to Spade's office at the beginning of the film and sets all of the action in motion. Even though Spade can see that she has been piling one lie on top of another throughout the film, for some reason he falls for her, the one act in this whole film that seems somewhat inconsistent with Spade's self-interested personna until the final scene when he does reveal that he has a "code" of sorts. This is truly one of the most interesting films of all time and a great vehicle for Bogart.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C7BOQVFH1HLE.html">A2C7BOQVFH1HLE</a><br/><p>Like a true classic should this movie seems to improve with each successive viewing.

The only problem I have is with the quality of the DVD; the picture quality isn't very good and the sound quality although Dolby Digital is in Mono.  Perhaps with the advent of Blu-Ray, a newer, better restored version will surface with good quality surround sound options perhaps DTS with THX for instance.<br /><br />Overall, this a a great movie but I'd recommend waiting for a better quality DVD version to come out.

Bogart plays the prototypical anti-hero and cynical detective to perfection and, while there are plenty of clich&eacute;s for noir aficionados in the story, the film is not hampered by these. There are plenty moments of intense dialogue between Shade and the two lieutenants who don't trust him, those searching for the statue (The Fat Man, Mr. Cairo), and the woman, Miss Wonderly, who Shade attempts to trust to give him the facts behind the mysterious killings and the statue. Sneering, cynical, and untrustworthy, Shade is by far the most impressive character in the story, and Bogart exemplifies him with his sarcastic smirk, his hearty laugh, his cool demeanor, and his quick temper. What truly makes his performance great is that it is a perfect fit for the novel's version of Sam Shade, and also because he encompasses both good and bad qualities that make him the typical "noir" investigator. Double-crosses, murder, a prized-possession, a femme fetal, mystery: this film has it all.<br /><br />Also included in the DVD is a segment (hosted by Robert Osborne of Turner Classic Movies) which focuses on the marketing of Bogart films, as well as some theatrical trailers for other Bogart films.</p></br><a href="../users/A17NFLRFTMYXF5.html">A17NFLRFTMYXF5</a><br/><p>The stuff dreams made of<p>Pursued by Lorre, Greenstreet;<p>But Bogey saves day</p></br><a href="../users/A3QLAOOTFEHCJI.html">A3QLAOOTFEHCJI</a><br/><p>Let's talk a minute about this movie's place in history.  The original author, Dashiell Hammett was a successful mystery writer and had many of his novels make their way to the silver screen.  One such series was "The Thin Man".  I always liked these movies, as much for their sets as anything.  Here we have a detective, Nick Charles and his wife always involved in something nefarious, but the movies were always light hearted and played with tongue in cheek.  A wink here and a wink there.  Martinis, fancy dress and parties were in play as much as the crime.  This all changed in 1941 when Hammett's "The Maltese Falcon" was remade with Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade.  Directed and written for the screen by John Huston, the film had a dark edge.  Bogart's detective wasn't a saint.  He smokes, drinks, sleeps with his partner's wife, and will stand up to anyone, even the cops.  Most film historians credit "The Maltese Falcon" as the beginning of the film noir style of filmmaking that continues to this day.  The movie has little action, but the script is fast and furious and you have to pay attention to keep up.  Lovely Mary Astor is set to play Sam for a sucker but he sees it coming.  And as much as he would obviously like to bed Brigid (Astor), he would much rather stay alive and out of jail.  We also meet a creepy effete Egyptian played by Peter Lorre and another creepy wannabe gansta' played by Elisha Cook, Jr.  Both will have successful film careers.  This is a first time appearance for hefty Sydney Greenstreet as Kasper Gutman, the primary crook.  The film is great fun to watch, especially Bogart rattling off Huston's dialog. It also shows that Hitchcock isn't the only director to know how to use the McGuffin.  A classic for all time.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>This, along with "Casablanca," is Humphrey Bogart at the top of his form. This is what makes it possible to do such credible Bogie imitations. "What is it?" "The stuff that dreams are made of."<br /><br />The Maltese Falcon is a black statuette of a falcon. The original purpose was the Knights Templar's tribute to the King of Spain. (The opening text refers to them as the "Knight Templars" for some bizarre reason.) It was made of solid gold encrusted with precious gems. It was stolen before it ever got to the king, and stolen from the thieves down through the centuries. At some point it was covered with a glossy black ceramic to disguise its gems.<br /><br />Sam Spade (Bogart) is a San Francisco detective; his partner is Miles Archer. They get a client who claims her sister has run away with a sinister character named Thursby, and she wants to get her sister back. Miles goes to meet Mr. Thursby, but he is shot at point-blank range instead. The logical assumption is that Thursby shot him, but then Thursby is shot dead. Not hard to guess that the police figure Spade shot Thursby, since they first speculated that he had shot his partner.<br /><br />There are three crooks who are apparently working together to discover the Maltese Falcon, Mr. Gutman (Sydney Greenstreet) and Peter Lorre. Both are defining roles for these actors. I've seen this movie so many times I can nearly recite it, and yet the whole complex structure continues to fascinate me. All the characters seem to be motivated by the immense wealth of the falcon's gem-encrusted golden body and the estimated $1 million it is apparently worth. (That's 1941 dollars, too, which might be 10 to 20 times as much now.)<br /><br />Try hard to keep all the characters straight in your mind. Try to guess who is working with whom, who is about to betray whom. Good luck!

Meanwhile, the client has disappeared and a man (Peter Lorre) holds Spade a gun point demanding the Maltese Falcon.  What in the world is going on?<br /><br />After I listened to this book on tape, I fully intended to watch the classic movie version.  It only took my three and a half years.  As such, my recollection of the book might be a little dim, but this movie version didn't deviate too wildly from what I remember.  In fact, it improved by tightening up several scenes near the climax that dragged in the book.  The story is still compelling and the characters seriously flawed.  Yes, the plot is now a cliche in many ways, but this story did it first.<br /><br />My only real complaint with the movie is the dated acting.  The characters speak too fast most of the time, not giving us time to process or emotions time to be fully explored.  Of course, that would be a blessing for Mary Astor who over acts all her emotional scenes, and she's got plenty of them.  The style of acting here would work well for the stage or a silent movie, but it's caught up in the transition to talking movies, still.<br /><br />Even so, this movie is well worth watching.

I mean, when you watch it and Ben Mankiewicz (I mention him mainly because I really like Robert Osborne) is raving about these older films with such enthusiasm and then you watch the film and you're wondering why he's not more critical, it just makes you want to share your point of view.  Shouldn't they be a tad more subjective when discussing these films?  Just because they are technically classic films doesn't mean they are flawless.  That is why I love it when Alec Baldwin makes a remark about an actress not delivering as strongly as he wanted and you can see the look on Robert Osborne's face, like he's trying to find a way to spin that into a positive.<br /><br />Anyways, I thought about this while watching `The Maltese Falcon'.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, the film is very good, but it isn't spectacular.  In fact, the reason I started thinking about the hosts not thinking subjectively enough was because Mankiewicz almost robotically started talking about how Sydney Greenstreet was the films standout, simply because he received an Oscar nomination.  Now, I liked his performance, but you'll be hard-pressed to convince me that he is better in this film than Peter Lorre or Mary Astor, both of whom completely elevate the film for me.<br /><br />I almost felt like yelling "have an opinion, that's what you're paid for" but I didn't.<br /><br />I heart you TCM, please know that.<br /><br />Anyways, `The Maltese Falcon' is a very good film, not a great one, but a very good one.  It is a noir that revolves around a private eye named Sam Spade who gets in over his head when he is propositioned by a beautiful young woman named Brigid O'Shaughnessy.  Brigid says she is looking for her sister, but as it turns out she is really looking for a priceless artifact known as the Maltese Falcon.  When Sam's partner winds up dead, and then the man he was paid to tail winds up dead, the police start to close in on Sam himself.  It's not just the police he has to worry about though, for Brigid not only brought a bollix story, she also brought a healthy dose of criminal activity in the form of Kasper Gutman and his henchmen, Joel Cairo and Wilmer Cook.<br /><br />Overall I found the film to be engaging and the twist at the end was VERY fulfilling (that descending elevator shot was priceless) so I totally give props to John Huston for deliver a finely toned directorial debut here.  The acting across the board was very good, but I did find that Humphrey Bogart's performance was a tad to clich&eacute;d and almost chalky in delivery.  He was pigeonholed for a time in this brand of acting, and at times it really worked for him and other times it came off a tad awkward.  I didn't like him much here, especially when everyone else in the cast outshined him without even trying.  At times I found the films script to be unnecessarily complicated, and you could tell it was trying to deceive you (which is almost never a good thing) but in the end you are left with an engaging experience, so you forgive the flaws.<br /><br />Anyways, I'm done with my rant.  Like I said, this film is very good, I just wish that some people looked at these films a little more objectively and didn't always tack on labels they feel the rest of the world expects them to tack on.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ.html">A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ</a><br/><p>Quick - as a young, energetic, inexperienced director you must make a final decision.  As this director, one must either decide to show the audience the famed jeweled bird that has nearly taken up an hour and forty minutes of time, or transform a rather talking ending into a glorified public service announcement.  The decision is a difficult one, but one must remember to reward the audience for their patience and time.  Alas, that is not the case with this director in his first film "The Maltese Falcon".  We are speaking of John Huston and his directorial debut with this live-action version of Dashiell Hammett's famed voice.  It is a caper of sorts, a classic "who-done-it" which forces the audience to listen for clues and make their own judgment upon a vast array of cinematic icons.  There is the first time introduction to the cultish detective Sam Spade, an early view of Chiklis' Vic Makey from "The Shield", in which Spade is held by no bonds and answers to nobody higher.  There is the dame, Brigid O'Shaughnessy, who is the quintessential wild-card of the group, holding nothing but betting all, she sparks where there should be a flame.  Peter Lorre's classic Joel Cairo leaves plenty for parody for the next several decades, while Sidney Greenstreet plays the clich&eacute; British crime lord willing to believe he is the smartest in the bunch.  So we have a beginning - Huston inventing a formula that will be copies, used, abused, and overplayed throughout Hollywood for the rest of days - so ... why doesn't this original feel original?<br /><br />With our players in place, Hammett's voice spoken with ease, and Huston behind the wheel - this should have felt like a country drive with tension building at the right parts, the take arriving sooner than expected, and Spade proving himself the victor unconditionally.  Yet, this wasn't the track "The Maltese Falcon" took.  Instead, we begin with a jumbled jigsaw puzzle of facts, relics, and the unknown that makes you feel that you have 5000 pieces and only an hour to complete.  Huston begins our story with grace, giving us early indication of our characters and brute honesty that seemed unexplored for the time, but just as we believe we understand the overall plot, he throws in more, on top of more, on top of more to thicken the plot, when in fact he is fully pulling us away from the illustrious "Falcon".  This movie is about a bird.  It is a rare statuette that promises wealth and power to whoever holds it.  It is this bird that scatters our characters all over the place, but ultimately takes them nowhere.  Without giving any overbearing plot points away, Spade early on looses his partner uncaringly.  Spade, a womanizer with his partner's wife, seems to care less about the death and is literally scraping his name away from the window the next day.  I understood Spade to be a loner, a troubled detective whose brains foiled his heart, but this seemed a bit too cold for a character that we were to care about.  Huston gives us nothing with Spade - any history that is begun is immediately dropped as a new plot devise is introduced.  Bogart lisps his way through the performance, proving that he is just as cold as the criminals, but never quite connects with the audience.  Huston will not give us the bird, so instead he detracts our focus away from the statue to Spade, which again, doesn't have enough to build on.<br /><br />My point is that our characters give us nothing.  They may be enjoyable to view on screen, but they are as bland and thin as the paper I write this on.  Over the years, they have been unjustly transformed into iconic characters, but I needed to know more about Spade - what made him tick and a bit more detail on his slight idiosyncrasies.  While I may have enjoyed watching Lorre's portrayal of Cairo, his usefulness became obsolete by the end.  These characters were there, but why?  This is a question the inexperienced Huston forgot to include, but Hammett does in detail throughout his book.  This is a talking caper, one that doesn't use fancy car chases or large shoot-outs to make their connections, but instead it uses words to guide our characters from A to B.  With this said, the words were in place to tell a great story - but Huston could not get his characters to give varied emotions to give us characters.  Am I too needy when it comes to early films of this nature?  How could "The Thin Man" successfully do this, and entertainingly make me laugh, while as the time moved I cared less and less about this falcon that was supposed to carry this film?  Huston just seemed to be missing a big element that should have connected our characters to this bird - we needed something to keep our motives in motion.<br /><br />Finally, without giving anything dynamic away, the ending was pitiful and unexciting.  Finally, we have exactly what we need, the chess pieces are ready to be victorious, but then nothing happens.  Huston builds tension, but provides no conclusion.  Instead of being an "Indiana Jones" our heroines become sputterer's of life lessons.  One doesn't need a lesson, we need a conclusion.  The final image of the bird in the light sent shivers down my spine because of the time devoted to this slap-happy mystery.  There was no mystery, only a warning about greed.  Even with the non-caring Spade, this film didn't mind that it sucked the suspense dry, from both Hammett and the viewers.<br /><br />Overall, I must credit this film for being an original.  Sam Spade's likeness has been used in nearly every detective film both symbolically and overtly.  But, just because an icon rests here - it doesn't mean that the film itself is worthy of praise.  Hammett's words were not voiced properly in this film, and the dedication towards nothing was outstanding.  This was a film about a statue of a bird, but instead we spend more time talking about it than actually finding the bird.  Our characters are paper thin, and by the end we care nothing for whomever ends up with it - either good or bad.  It was as if Huston had taken all the pieces of a puzzle, bunched them together, randomly hammered them together, and then provided us with a sloppy finished product.  I wanted to like this film - it is a dark classic that is honestly overplayed - but I cared nothing for what was happening.  Thirty minutes in I was bored.  What would Spade think of that?  "The Maltese Falcon" is worth one viewing, but any more would be disastrous.  The verbose ending ruined my image of Spade - how about you?<br /><br />Grade: *** out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A37B3O457INKEA.html">A37B3O457INKEA</a><br/><p>THE MALTESE FALCON is my favorite detective movie of all time. It is considered a classic today because so many different facets of the film's making seem to have come together magically in this one production.<p>John Huston was a screenwriter who wanted to remake the old MALTESE FALCON as his first film as a director. He not only did a superb job in his directing debut but also acted as screenwriter.<p>The selection of Sydney Greenstreet to fill the role of Kaspar Gutman at age 61 after specializing in playing butlers on Broadway was another fortunate choice. Greenstreet had no previous Hollywood experience.<p>The most important decision of all was probably to cast Humphrey Bogart as Sam Spade after George Raft had turned down the offer. It helped that the film had an all-star array of actors to complement Bogart. It would be difficult to find more suitable picks than Mary Astor, Gladys George, Peter Lorre, Barton MacLane, Lee Patrick, Ward Bond and Elisha Cook, Jr. Even a mere cameo appearance by Walter Huston resulted in an unforgettable scene. The director's father portrayed the dying Captain Jacobi of the La Paloma delivering the Falcon to Spade's office.<p>THE MALTESE FALCON is certainly not a love story in the style of CASABLANCA. The Bogart characters in both films, however, strike me as being quite similar. I see them both as ordinary men who rise to heroic heights by sticking to a few basic rules of decency - in spite of their many human failings.<p>I highly recommend THE MALTESE FALCON and am sure that I will no doubt see it again - and again.</p></br><a href="../users/ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV.html">ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV</a><br/><p>Seldom has any novel been so successfully interpreted on screen: in approaching Dashiell Hammett's seminal private-eye novel, director John Huston not only stayed meticulously true to the plot, he also lifted great chunks on the novel's dialogue directly into the script--and then styled the pace, cinematography, and performances to reflect Hammett's stripped-for-action tone.  And the result, to borrow a phrase from the film, is "the stuff that dreams are made of."  THE MALTESE FALCON is a iconographic landmark in twentieth century cinema.<p>The story is well known.  Private eyes Sam Spade and Miles Archer are employed by an attractive but decidedly questionable Brigid O'Shaughnessy to track down a man named Thursby--but within hours of taking the case both Miles Archer and Thursby are shot dead, and Spade finds himself embroiled in a search for a legendary lost treasure: the figure of a falcon, encrusted with jewels.<p>The cast is remarkable.  Humphrey Bogart made a name for himself first on the stage and then in films with a series of memorable gangster roles, and was fresh from his great success in HIGH SIERRA; Sam Spade, which offered a new twist on his already established persona, was an inspired bit of casting.  Mary Astor had been a great star in silent film, but the late twenties and early thirties found her dogged by scandal; perhaps deliberately playing on those memories, she brought a remarkable mixture of toughness, tarnish, and absolute believability to the role of the very, very dangerous Brigid.  And the chemistry between Bogart and Astor is a remarkable thing, a simmering sexuality that more glossy casting could have never achieved.<p>The supporting cast is equally fine. Although a great star in Europe and the star of a number of 1930s films, Peter Lorre was still something of an unknown quanity in American film; Sidney Greenstreet was a minor stage actor with no screen experience; Elisha Cook was a well-liked but neglected character actor.  But THE MALTESE FALCON would fix all three firmly in the public mind, and to some extent all three would continue to play variations of their FALCON roles for the rest of their lives.<p>FALCON is particularly noted as one of several films that craftily circumvented the notorious "Production Code" by effectively implying but never directly stating the various sexual relations between the characters.  Spade has clearly had an affair with Archer's wife, Iva; Archer is clearly a man on the sexual make, and leaps at the chance to tail Brigid.  Lorre's lines effectively expose Brigid as man-hungry, and the script and situations do everything but flatly state that Lorre's character is homosexual.  Perhaps most startling is the implied sexual relationship between Sidney Greenstreet and the hoodlum Elisha Cook, and the concluding implication that Lorre may well replace Cook in Greenstreet's affections.  Just as the plotlines swirl and twist, so do the layers of innuendo and the tangles of sexual uncertainty--all of it adding to the film's feel of uneasy decadence and grittiness.<p>The DVD bonuses are enjoyable but slight--two film trailers and a documentary that uses trailers to show how Warner Bros. marketed Bogart during the 1930s and 1940s.  But even if it came without any bonuses the DVD would still be greatly welcomed: although it has not been restored in a computer-corrected sense, this is the finest print I have ever seen of the film, far superior to anything available on VHS.  A great film, a true essential, and strongly, strongly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL.html">A3D6TFYRMIV3ZL</a><br/><p>Like few other actors, Humphrey Bogart ruled the Hollywood of the 1940s and 1950s - epitome of the handsome, cynical and oh-so lonesome wolf and looking unbeatably cool in his fedora and trenchcoat, a cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth; endowed with a legendary aura several times larger than his real life stature, and still admired by scores of women wishing they had been born 50+ years earlier, preferably somewhere in California and to parents connected with the movie business, so as to have at least a marginal chance of meeting him.  The American Film Institute recently elected him the No. 1 film legend of the 20th century; and looking back, indeed no other actor seems to have been surrounded by the same kind of darkly magical aura as the one surrounding Bogart.<br /><br />"The Maltese Falcon" (1941), directed by John Huston, based on Dashiell Hammett's 1930 like-named novel and itself also ranking in the top quarter of the AFI's list of the 100 best 20th century movies, laid the groundwork for Bogart's lasting image, by transforming his on-screen persona from the tough, often two-dimensional gangsters he had portrayed before; beginning with the 1936 adaptation of Robert Sherwood's "Petrified Forest" where, like in its 1934 stage production, Bogart had starred opposite Leslie Howard, with Bette Davis as the female lead.  Now imbuing his tough guy shell with a softer core, in "The Maltese Falcon" Bogart became not only Hammett's Sam Spade but, moreover, the film noir anti-hero per se; a role that stayed with him throughout the rest of his career, and in which he still remains virtually unparalleled.<br /><br />The movie's long-famous story centers around the mysterious statute of a falcon made from solid gold, diamonds and other precious stones; the 16th century Maltese Knights' immeasurably precious gift of thanks to Emperor Charles V for the protection he had granted them.  Stolen by pirates, blackened on the outside in order to conceal its true value and passed on through the centuries by a number of unsuspecting possessors, it finally attracts the attention of two rivaling pairs of equally cunning, ruthless and high-flying scoundrels, who chase each other and the statue halfway around the world and finally end up in Sam Spade's San Francisco office - not without getting both Spade's partner Miles Archer (Jerome Cowan) and one of their own killed in the process; thus also causing additional grief for Spade, whom the police soon suspect of being behind the murders himself - or at least behind that of Archer - in order to make off with Archer's widow Iva (Gladys George).  And of course, it doesn't exactly help that he has had his office sign changed from "Spade & Archer" to "Samuel Spade" within mere hours of his partner's death.<br /><br />Looking at the movie and its stars' almost mythical fame, it is difficult to imagine that, produced at the height of the studio system era, this was originally just one of the roughly 50 films released by Warner Brothers over the course of one year. But mass production didn't equal low quality; on the contrary, the great care given to all production values, from script-writing to camera work, editing, score and the stars' presentation in the movie itself and in its trailer, was as responsible for its lasting success as were Humphrey Bogart and his outstanding costars; first and foremost Mary Astor as the double-crossing and now partner-less Brigid O'Shaughnessy, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet (in their first of several appearances opposite Bogart) as Joel Cairo and Kaspar Guttman, O'Shaughnessy/Astor's competitors for possession of the precious statue, and Elisha Cook, Jr., as Guttman's rough but inept bodyguard Wilmer Cook.  Genre-defining and the first truly giant highlight of Bogart's career, "The Maltese Falcon" is an unmissable piece of Hollywood history, captivating you from the first moment you spend in Sam Spade's office all the way to its cynical conclusion, and a thrill to watch over and over again.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIXLUW">Humphrey Bogart - The Signature Collection, Vol. 1 (Casablanca Two-Disc Special Edition / The Treasure of the Sierra Madre Two-Disc Special Edition / They Drive by Night / High Sierra)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIXLVQ">Humphrey Bogart - The Signature Collection, Vol. 2 (The Maltese Falcon Three-Disc Special Edition / Across the Pacific / Action in the North Atlantic / All Through the Night / Passage to Marseille)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFL2Q6">Bogie and Bacall - The Signature Collection (The Big Sleep / Dark Passage / Key Largo / To Have and Have Not)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1883011671">Complete Novels: Red Harvest, The Dain Curse, The Maltese Falcon, The Glass Key, and The Thin Man (Library of America #110)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1883011078">Raymond Chandler: Stories and Early Novels: Pulp Stories / The Big Sleep / Farewell, My Lovely / The High Window (Library of America)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00114XLR8">Brother Orchid</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FI9OAY">Bullets or Ballots</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000EYUCU">The Postman Always Rings Twice</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNG5">Double Indemnity (Universal Legacy Series)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000UAE7RW">Chinatown (Special Collector's Edition)</a></p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>I'm so tired of seeing weak new movies; thank god for strong old ones! Here's a masterpiece I've seen at least twenty times in the last three decades, and it never gets old.<br /><br />What makes these classic studio pictures great (when they are great....most are not...Hollywood has always been about money before art...when art happens it seems accidental...)? I think it's that there were no special effects, no garish color, no visual tricks to pull out of a hat when things slow down. Dramatic craftsmanship was needed, and was sometimes delivered in spades [insert pun here].<br /><br />Two things make the best black and white chestnuts great: a very strong story that's well-paced and develops intelligently, and strongly written characters played by actors who know that stories hinge on character development as much as on plot development. The two should go hand in hand. When they do, real art ensues.<br /><br />I love the writing of both Hammett and Chandler; hard-boiled dialogue is hard to beat when it's done well, and they are the masters. Hammett may  have invented the modern solipsistic detective with his Continental Op, a long cry from Holmes and Poirot. The Op turned into Sam Spade and the Falcon is all about Spade, and Bogie's innate understanding of this mostly good man stuck in a mostly bad world.<br /><br />The dialogue is razor sharp, the direction gemlike in its precision. No wasted lines, no wasted camera movement, no wasted time. The movie starts fast and never lets up. We get some truly classic characters, and the actors make these good roles into masterpieces, especially Lorre and Greenstreet. There are some phenomenally fine shots here; chiaroscuro this sharp rarely comes from outside Europe.<br /><br />There is far too much to list in terms of greatness in the Falcon. It is about as good as Hollywood ever got in telling a story and making it entertaining; we can thank mainly Hammett for that. The weltschmerz and hard-bitten cynicism on display here are far too intelligent for films these days.<br /><br />Ain't it funny that the best old black and white movies show us so clearly that life is never black and white, while movies in dazzling color tend to make life seem one-dimensional, in a good guy vs. bad guy way? The Falcon has no good guy, just a bunch of people who are all good and bad.<br /><br />When I get sick of crappy movies, I put this baby on and am reminded of why I love movies so much in the first place. Like good music and good literature, they take me somewhere new (even if I've been there before) and send me home knowing more about myself and the world than I did when I started. They also remind me that art and love are where you choose to find them, for they are everywhere. Even in the dark corners of life.<br />And in the end, shweetheart, only you can make you happy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CIW2OEVAJRM2.html">A1CIW2OEVAJRM2</a><br/><p>Normally a movie that leaves you with no idea what is going on is terribly annoying.  Not this one.  It's brilliant.  It hails from the era when detective movies were making the transition from sophisticated plots and sharp thinking heros like Sherlock Holmes to the furious action of gun toting thugs and hard-core cops.  The Maltese Falcon pioneered film-noir by introducing a small amount of action and mayhem with the hard-nosed hero performing several aggressive moves.  But on the whole the murders and action are simply the background to the psychological question of whodunnit and the movie is unburdened by profanity or graphic violence.<p>There are several main characters, notably abrasive Humphrey Bogart as tough guy private-eye Sam Spade.  He must sort out the mystery behind the murder of his partner, and untangle a complicated web of intrigue involving the beautiful Brigid O'Shaunessy, the mysterious Joel Cairo, the gunman Wilmer Cook, and the obese "Fat Man" Kasper Gutman.  In the quest for the fabled and priceless Maltese Falcon, there are several corpses that need to be accounted for.  Whoddunit?  For 99% of the movie, I had no idea, and was led on a wild goose chase of plot twists and possibilities.  The superb plot (based on the novel by Dashiell Hammett) had me well and truly baffled.  <p>But the deception of artificial tears or false stories does not easily fool the perceptiveness of Sam Spade, nor does opposition quickly repress his confidence.  Even the tinge of romance that is present is not overly sappy, because Sam Spade's determined moral principles easily overcome any passions for love or money that have conquered the villains he is pursuing.  The hero of The Maltese Falcon is in this sense quite unlike the hero of the legendary Casablanca.  His pursuit of truth and justice and immunity to the vices of girls and greed is completely inspiring, and so very unlike the movies of today.  When the solution finally came at the end, I was amazed, but quite satisfied.  Armed with the solution, I was ready to view and enjoy the whole movie again in a new light.  The Maltese Falcon is renowned movie from 1941 that ranks among the greatest detective movies ever, and is a real treat to lovers of mystery today.  Like mystery?  Go watch it.  You'll enjoy it more than once!</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>This was John Huston's first film and some say his best.  It features a most interesting cast led by Humphrey Bogart who, one can see, had a great time playing the devil-may-care and cynical private eye, Sam Spade, a creation of mystery novelist Dashiell Hammett, who also created another cinematic favorite, The Thin Man (1934) (and sequels) starring William Powell and Myrna Loy.  Playing opposite Bogey as the tearful and treacherous Brigid O'Shaughnessy is Mary Astor, at the time in her mid-thirties and a veteran of many films going back to the silent era.  Interestingly enough one of the films was The Runaway Bride (1930).  In Hollywood the films never change, they just get make-overs.<p>Peter Lorre plays the perfumed and villainous Joel Cairo in a style both humorous and sinister.  His distinctive high pitched voice has become a staple of cartoon villains.  Sidney Greenstreet, the rotund one, who catches up on his reading while they await the delivery of the falcon, plays Kasper Gutman, art connoisseur and sly crook.  Elisha Cook Jr., the eternal little man with a gun, whose face seldom changes expression from that of hurtful vengeance, plays Wilmer Cook, Gutman's bodyguard.<p>What makes this film the favorite of so many is the supremely confident manner in which Sam Spade deals with not only the motley assortment of crooks and con artists, but with the police, tearful women and the district attorney.  He's a man's man whose rationality and good old fashioned common sense allow him to spot deception in the twinkling of an eye and give him the power to turn his back on love if there are strings attached.  The cosmopolitan air and the sophisticated script allow the players full scope and they are fascinating to watch.  Astor's fake tears and feigned innocence cause both Bogey and the audience to grin broadly.  And the t?te-a-t?tes among all the characters, but especially between Greenstreet and Bogart and Lorre and Bogart--the big eyes, the greedy grabbing of guns--are the kind of scenes you can watch again and again with pleasure.<p>Some see greed as the theme of this film, and indeed John Huston is very good at delineating the psychology of greed--witness also his The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948)--but in the existential character of Sam Spade we see an American legend come to life.  He is the thinking man of action living life by his wits and an independent code, the kind of man who takes life as it comes but without ever losing his sense of humor, the kind of guy we'd all like to be.<p>There are a couple of earlier version of this film, The Maltese Falcon (1931) with Bebe Daniels and Ricado Cortez, and one starring Bette Davis and Warren William called Satan Met a Lady (1936), neither of which I've seen, but I understand that the 1931 version is very good.  With help from a script by Truman Capote, Huston made a kind of a spoof in Beat the Devil (1954).<p>Incidentally, in this and in The Big Sleep (1946), Bogart never really plays the gumshoe with the kind of hard-nosed disregard for conventional morality as envisioned in the novels, but is politically-corrected for the mass movie audience.  Note here however that the first thing Sam Spade does when he gets the guys unconscious is to go through their wallets.<p>Bottom line: a classic and a treat.  Don't miss it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3BSS2M2DPPV4T.html">A3BSS2M2DPPV4T</a><br/><p>A classic fabled film from 1941, this story set in San Francisco in the office of Archer and Spade is movie making at it's best. The actors give uniformly great performances and almost eerily seem to be born for their  parts: Bogie as Sam Spade; Jerome Cowan as Archer; Greenstreet as Gutman;  Elisha Cook as Wilmer; Lee Patrick as Effie and, of course, Peter Lorre as  Cairo. Mary Astor briefly revived her fading career (a 1936 red-hot scandal  was mostly to blame) and as Brigid O' Shaughnessy she's in her element as  the pathological liar; hers is a classic performance. Strangely, this is  actually the THIRD filmization of the Dashiell Hammett novel, the others  being a 1931 version with Bebe Daniels and Ricardo Cortez (in all fairness,  it was adequate) and the poor SATAN MET A LADY,a bizarre 1936 version with  Bette Davis (!) and the mealy Warren William.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>The Maltese Falcon is considered the first Film-Noir ever made and is a classic and highly innovative film starring Humphrey Bogart, Mary Astor, and Peter Lorre. The movie is #23 on The American Film Institute's Top 100 and is written and directed by John Huston. Right from the beginning of the movie I realized how many movies this thing has inspired. The first ten minutes of the film kept bringing to mind the first ten minutes of another classic film called "Chinatown." Ironically, "Chinatown" co-starred this films director John Huston. Bogart, in one of his most famous roles, plays Sam Spade, a Private detective who is hired by Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Astor) to chase away a man her sister is dating. Spade sends his partner Archer, but Archer (and the sisters' date) is killed. But Spade smells something fishy and his sense of smell is heightened when a mysterious man named Joel Cairo (Lorre) offers him $5000 dollars to find a jewel-encrusted falcon. Frequent scenes in which Sam outsmarts or outmuscles the bad guys are hilarious. The movie's final line is one of films most famous. This film doesn't evoke the same mood and tone that I associate with "film-noir" but whatever you want to call it...It's a great film. It's very entertaining, Sam Spade is one of Bogart's greatest creations (kind of the opposite of Rick, the character he would go on to play in "Casablanca"). Peter Lorre is wonderful as Cairo, although he's not quite as bugeyed as he was in the German-classic M. For another example of how good (and important) this movie is, I must mention that you can see echoes of this film in almost any detective movie that was made after it. This is a masterpiece of cinema. Don't miss it.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>After years of playing villains for Warner Brothers, this picture demonstrated once and for all Bogart's star quality.

But a pretty girl walks into their office one day with a false name, a story full of holes and Archer's fate firmly in her grasp. When Miles falls victim to the ruse, it's up to Sam Spade to get to the bottom of it; even at the cost of his own reputation which is already severely in question. A greasy little worm named Cairo and a fat man weave a more complex tapestry of intrigue as Spade is led on a quest for "the stuff dreams are made of". With the success of "The Petrified Forest", Bogart appended his fame in tough gumshoe roles, much the same way as Edward G. Robinson established his at the same studio; with roles on the other side of the law. John Huston was to cross paths with him once more for a third and fourth effort in Technicolor, namely; "The Treasure of the Sierra Madre" and finally "The African Queen". It may well be said that both Huston and Bogart gleaned the cream of their respective careers from each other, thus leaving a combined cinematic legacy unmatched by any other such combination of talent, and certainly giving Warner Brothers a cornerstone of integrity in the world of film. Particularly notable supporting performance from Lee Patrick as Spade's harried secretary.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>The Maltese Falcon (John Huston, 1941)<br /><br />That The Maltese Falcon was John Huston's directorial debut says, by the cast and crew he was able to assemble for it, a good deal about how respected he already was in Hollywood by the time he directed this, both as actor and screenwriter. Huston would go on, of course, to perch at the top of Hollywood's A-list for decades, and more than any other film he directed with the arguable exception of The African Queen, The Maltese Falcon shows every reason why.<br /><br />Humphrey Bogart plays Dashiell Hammett's immortal antihero Sam Spade, and more than any other actor, Bogart has come to represent Spade in film form, despite having never made another Spade movie and looking nothing like the "blond Satan" described in Hammett's novel. What is, perhaps, most sunning about Bogart's performance (if it is not his best, it is tied with The African Queen and The Desperate Hours for that honor) is that so much of the book was removed, including most every scene that illuminates Spade's relationship with Brigid O'Shaughnessy, and Bogart still brings the role to life even for those who have no idea who Sam Spade is. Mary Astor, an A-list star at the time (The Maltese Falcon was her ninety-eighth film) who has since fallen into relative obscurity, plays the duplicitous Ms. O'Shaughnessy to the hilt, both helpless and manipulative at the same time; Astor's portrayal of O'Shaughnessy still stands over sixty years later as one of the most subtle and nuanced performances to ever grace a screen. Peter Lorre, riding a wave of success that started with his amazing performance in M and continued through the Hammer horror films he made just prior to his death, gives what for any other actor would be a career-best performance as Joel Cairo; for Lorre, it ranks with his performance in M. The main characters are rounded out by Sydney Greenstreet, in his debut film role at the age of fifty-nine, and Elisha Cook, Jr., almost forty but looking surprisingly like the twenty-one-year-old tough of Hammett's novel.<br /><br />If there is a flaw to the film, and in most films it is the major flaw, it is that Huston's adaptation of Hammett's novel is, to say the least, a bit lacking in continuity and substance. What Huston managed to preserve, however, is the flavor; what parts of the novel exist in the film are rabidly faithful to their source material, and some of the cuts have obvious reasons given the time the movie was made (for example, the casual sex between Spade and O'Shaughnessy, or his strip-search of her at the beginning of the book's long climax). The relationships between the characters are altered for the film, but Huston has covered all the bases, making sure the alterations don't leave wear at the edges. In other words, Huston has crafted a perfect script out of a flawed adaptation, and for that reason it's impossible to find fault with the adaptation. Even the plot holes seem as if they're put in for effect.<br /><br />The music is a tad overdone, but hey, it was 1941. What do you expect?<br /><br />If there is such a thing as a perfect film, The Maltese Falcon is one of them. *****</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>The mark of a truly great film is that it not only holds up with each reviewing, but actually gets better and more impressive.  While it is always exhilarating to enjoy the plot the first time through, once you know what is going to happen, you get to focus on other, smaller things that may have escaped you before.  For instance, notice that each scene begins with either a camera or a character in motion.  You don't just get a cut to the inside of a room, but a cut to a character entering a room.  This gives the film as a whole a very active, energetic feel, as if the whole picture were alive.  It puts you, the viewer, in the middle of the action, instead of merely passively sitting back and watching the scenes unfold before you.  Subtleties like this help make this one of the truly great films Hollywood produced.<p>Humphrey Bogart was not an A-list actor when this film came out.  He was afterwards.  Earlier in 1941 he had surprised Hollywood by excelling in a lead role in HIGH SIERRA, so his success in THE MALTESE FALCON was not a complete surprise.  From this point onwards, Warners and other studios always were on the lookout for the next film for him to star in.  Before, he got roles by default.  Note:  many think he got the lead in CASABLANCA by default, but in fact Warners had him cast in the role from the beginning, but spread some false information about who was to star in it (e.g., Ronald Reagan) in order to build suspense as to who would star.  But CASABLANCA was intended as a Bogart vehicle from the start, thanks to THE MALTESE FALCON.<p>Apart from the magnificent direction by John Huston (shown in such details as the active camera mentioned above), there are two major reasons this film succeeds so well.  First, many point to this film as one of the very few that is as good as the novel upon which it is based.  The reason for this in this case is the fact that John Huston stuck as close to the novel as was possible in Hays Office Hollywood (i.e., he had to tone certain things down to pass the Code, like Joel Cairo's homosexuality, which was far more commented upon in the novel).  Most of the best scenes are taken word-for-word from the novel, such as the "Fat Man's" great conversation with Sam Spade.  Dashiell Hammett had a genius for hard-hitting dialog, and Huston wisely decided to leave it alone.  Huston was brilliant at transparently adapting Hammett's novel with as little tinkering as possible.<p>The third great reason for the film's success is the virtually perfect cast.  Although Bogart wasn't the first choice for the film, it is now impossible to imagine anyone else in the role.  The movie, in fact, made stars of many of the principles involved.  Mary Astor had her career revived, Sydney Greenstreet immediately became one of the leading character actors in Hollywood, Elisha Wood Jr. became a familiar face in film, and Peter Lorre, who had made a long string of films in England and the US (including the Mr. Moto movies) since leaving Germany upon the Nazis rise to power, became a much more prominent figure in American film.  Huston himself was one of the more prominent directors in Hollywood for the rest of his career, thanks to his great success in this, his first film.<p>A final note:  the film is remarkable for its cinematography, and is rightfully considered one of the first film noirs for its use of light and shadow.  Interestingly, the person in charge of photography, Arthur Edeson, had been the cinematographer on the 1936 William Dieterle's SATAN MET A LADY, the second film version of Hammett's novel, the film (Huston's being the third).  I'm not aware if his previous experience added to the quality of the film, but it is a fascinating coincidence.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DTCJV6KOMJOA.html">A1DTCJV6KOMJOA</a><br/><p>This film is one of those flicks that just starts everything else in its genre but still after numerous films copy it it ransk as the best! Maltese Falcon gives of four big things; amazing dialogue, Humphrey Bogart, great cinemtography, and unseen violence! The plot follows a swine after swin as they search for a jewel encrusted falcon the only hitch is that somewhere along the line the falcon was misplaced. Bogart wants to know who has it and why everyone wants it! The dialogue is the saving grace of the film overlapping and delivered faster than a pizza! Smacks and gunshots are thrown all around the screen and Houston's direction catches every bit of it. Houston paints such a clear vision that the camera tends not to so much follow the scenes but move them along. houston constatnly pans off to follow and actor befor they even move making for a sense of rushed urgency and moving the film at break neck speeds. Bogart is offering his tough guy persona that he will later use to the utmost but here its raw, new and powerful. Mary Astor as the film's ice queen is brilliant. Never reaching the fame she deserved her off easy looks and washed out expressionsa nd stabbing tone of voice are just stunning and adds an extra element of danger. The film uses the &quot;invisible gun technique&quot;; of when you believe the film's &quot;main&quot; character is just off screen and will come into the plot to give the film another level of over the top depth but it never happens but its in the illusion of this character that gives the flick an omnipresent feel. Films of this stature are not even being produced anymore because this level of talent is no longer around.</p></br><a href="../users/A3CFT5LHFCB46K.html">A3CFT5LHFCB46K</a><br/><p>1941. A good year in cinema history in terms of memorable movies and performances, But when it came to film debuts, this was arguably the best year in movies. The first and probably most well known was Actor/Director Orson Welles (Which, I hope, no explanation is necessary). The other was Director John Huston for "The Maltese Falcon". While not as effecting or groundbreaking as "Citizen Kane", it's still nevertheless a tremendous first effort. A tight, well crafted, gripping mystery, this film is deserving of being considered one of the best movies ever made. <p>Star Humphrey Bogart also had a very good year in 1941. After a decade of playing parts in gangster films like "The Petrified Forest" and "The Roaring Twenties", Bogart finally hit it big with his performances as ex-convict `Mad Dog' Earl in "High Sierra" and as Private Detective Samuel Spade in this movie. Bogart is excellent in his role, tough and brutal. He established with this role (And his Philip Marlowe in "The Big Sleep" what the detectives of later film noirs would be like. Considering this one of his trademark performances, it's surprising he didn't get nominated for this or "High Sierra".  <p>In addition to Bogart's superb lead role, he is assisted by a colorful supporting cast. Mary Astor as a client who gets Sam involved with the falcon, Peter Lorre as Cairo, who is looking for the Falcon, Sydney Greenstreet (In his first talkie film) as "Fatman", who is also looking for the Maltese Falcon, and Elisha Cook, Jr. as Wilma, a thug of Fatman's. <p>As everyone knows who's seen the movie, the film's most famous quote comes at the end<br />when Spade, carrying the falcon in his hands, calls it "The stuff that dreams are made of". But with all the virtues of this production, could he have been referring to the movie? The debate goes on...<p>Some other great quotes from the movie:<p>Sam Spade: We didn't believe your story, Mrs. O'Shaughnessy, we believed your 200 dollars.<p>Wilmer Cook: Keep on riding me and they're gonna be picking iron out of your liver.<p>Kasper Gutman: I couldn't be fonder of you if you were my own son. But, well, if you lose a son, its possible to get another. <p>Sam Spade: When a man's partner is killed, he's supposed to do something about it.<p>Joel Cairo: You always have a very smooth explanation...<br />Sam Spade: What do you want me to do, learn to stutter?<p>Joel Cairo: You... you bungled it!</p></br><a href="../users/A1COW0UIB5HA9J.html">A1COW0UIB5HA9J</a><br/><p>Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart) is your typical San Fransisco detective who just lost his partner Archer (Jerome Cowen).

During after the success of "Casablanca", Bogart made another memorable as hell role known as Sam Spade and this is the directorial debut of John Houston which earned him some oscars for this remarkable motion picture. Peter Lorre here gives off his best performance as you can see this movie with the character he played was an inspiration to Ren in the popular cartoon "Ren and Stimpy" with his famous "You stupid, you bloated idiot!" line. What also works is the brilliant performances of everyone else even the lovely Astor who is stunning, the excellent black and white photography and the storytelling as it's faithful to it's source than 1931's attempt giving us a winner.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray is stunning for an old movie it really has improved picture and good sound quality such as commentary, featurettes, newsreel, short, 2 classic looney tunes cartoons, trailers and audio-only bonus such as the adaptation of the book from radio show that includes Edward G.

Dashiell Hammett's masterpiece is in the exquisite hands of John Huston and he produces something worthy of any writer's imagination here.  How many insufferable, and stylistically sleek, remakes will we have to put up with until studios realize that reissuing classics is their best entertainment gamble?  The reason that we regard the younger generations as not being able to appreciate films like these is simply because they haven't been exposed to them.  Bogart is sensational and as ambiguous as can be within the larger framework of good versus evil.  From the very first moments of Falcon, just after Miles Archer gets slugged, you fathom that Sam Spade is a most unusual human being and is attached intimately to little around him.  Lorre and Greenstreet are magnificent characters on their own as well.  If I had to chose between The Maltese Falcon and Casablanca the choice would not be an easy one.  Ten stars would be issued if possible.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RH7ARWQSUVQV.html">A2RH7ARWQSUVQV</a><br/><p>"The Maltese Falcon" is a great movie because of its great actors and tight dialogue.  Bogart, as the cynical but ultimately ultramoral, Sam Spade, is great as are his antitheses, Peter Lorre, Sidney Greenstreet and Mary Astor.  Spade is suckered by a beautiful woman [Astor] into what turns out to be the criminal enterprise of locating the 'Maltese Falcon', a ceramic bird worth millions.  Men and women fight and die to gain its possession.<br /><br />The plot is convoluted but convincing and, finally, after the murder of several illicit wealth-seekers, the Falcon is located it and is found to be a phony.  The cops lead the beautiful Astor who, while still proclaiming her 'love' for Bogart, off to her well-deserved punishment.  Bogart, as Spade, has the opportunity to set her free but...does the 'right' thing and refuses to save her.  Still, the last lines of the film really turn it from a good detective film to a great one.  When asked what the worthless ceramic bird is all about, Spade answers, "The stuff dreams are made of."<br /><br />Dreams, after all, aren't really about wealth.  They are about pursuit.<br /><br />Ron Braithwaite, author of novels--"Skull Rack" and "Hummingbird God"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico</p></br><a href="../users/AGEIT17HENDIS.html">AGEIT17HENDIS</a><br/><p>Dashiell Hammett, along with Raymond Chandler, reinvented the detective genre in the 1930's and 1940's. They moved the genre away from the amateurish and simple parlor detectives that had previously dominated the genre to hard-boiled action characters who knew what was what and didn't mind taking a beating to get the bad guys. And along the way they produced some very memorable literary characters as well. Nick Charles, Sam Spade and Phillip Marlowe are well known exemplars of the action detective.<br /><br />Hammett and Chandler also speak to a different, more macho if you will, but also a more world-wary and world-weary style of detection than today's hyper-extended and techno-detail-oriented detectives who rely on computers and gadgetry more than guts. Still, with few exceptions, it is hard now to find a better proto-type for the kind of detective that writers of detective fiction wished they had, in their long, smoke-filled, whiskey-soaked, staring at that blank white page, writer nights (and we will not even speak of the days), dreamed up than Sam Spade. Nor a better, sparse, functional language-filled story line than old Dashiell Hammett thought up.<br /><br />In literature and film there have been no lack of private detective-types depicted from the urbane Nick Charles (also a Hammett creation) to Mickey Spillane's  rough and tumble Mike Hammer but the classic model for all modern ones is Dashiell Hammett's Sam Spade (the Humphrey Bogart role in the film) in Maltese Falcon. Some may argue Raymond Chandler's Phillip Marlowe and may have a point but as for film adaptation Spade wins hands down. Compare, if you will, Bogart's performance in Maltese Falcon with the Big Sleep. Get my point. But enough of that.  What make's Spade the classic is his intrepidness, his orneriness, his dauntless dedication to the task at hand, his sense of irony, his incorruptibility, his willingness to take an inordinate amount of bumps and bruises for paltry fees and his off-hand manner with the ladies and a gun. And in Maltese Falcon he needs all of these qualities and then some.<br /><br />And for what? It is the bird, stupid. You know, the stuff that dreams are made of. This modern tale of greed and desire gets nicely worked with a cast of adventurers, including Sam's love interest, who are serious, inept, and ultimately dangerous. There is a certain amount of off-handed humor as is warranted by some of the situations thrown in to boot. Sam is well up to handling everything thrown at him by is male adversaries. But, the dame (played by Mary Astor in the film), that is a different question. She is as greedy (if not more so) than the rest but she is ready to use her feminine wiles on even the incorruptible Spade in order to get that damn bird. That, dear friends, puts her beyond the pale and she will have many a lonely night in prison to think that through. In the end Sam's honor and the honor of his profession is intact, and that's what counts in his world.</p></br><a href="../users/AGZVS6M8XJGN6.html">AGZVS6M8XJGN6</a><br/><p>The Forties were the years when Hollywood decided that the mystery thriller deserved big-budget, big-star treatment, threw up a new kind of hero who was exactly right for his time: they were the fabulous years which established the private eye adventure as the irremovable all-time favorite in the whole field of suspense... The field was so rich, the choice so lavish in that decade, that it was difficult to know where memory should stop and call "Encore".<br /><br />As the author of the screenplay, Huston made every effort to do justice, and remain faithful, to Dashiell Hammett's novel... But in remaining faithful, the newest version asked audiences to accept the complicated plot at its full strength and that is where the film's main flaw occurs... Names, murders, and intrigues turn up so quickly that it is extremely difficult to understand exactly what is happening in this tale of an assortment of characters in search of a fabulous jewel-encrusted statue...<br /><br />Probably in no other film will a viewer find a gallery of such diverse human beings whose perfect1y constructed portrayals remain permanently locked in one's memory...<br /><br />Mary Astor's Brigid O'Shaughnessy is a striking picture of feminine deceit and betrayal... Able to shed tears on command, she is a confirmed liar who can be as deadly as she is beautiful; she can make passionate love to Bogart, but wouldn't hesitate a moment to kill him if it suited her plan... Her performance is surely one of the screen's most brilliant portrayals of duplicity masked with fascination...<br /><br />Sydney Greenstreet, in his movie debut, was equally memorable as the menacingly mountainous man behind the search for the elusive black bird, and almost stole the picture... Cunning, determined, appreciative of the fine arts, Greenstreet--who seemed to get more dangerous as he got more imperturbably polite--is a man who would devote his entire life to a single quest if need be...<br /><br />Peter Lorre's Joel Cairo was a resolute picture of classic villainy... With curled hair and impeccably clean dress, he is an unpredictable accomplice of Greenstreet, difficult to deal with...<br /><br />But it is Bogart's portrayal of Sam Spade that remains classic in its construction... Obviously cynical, he still maintains his own code of ethics which he adheres to faithfully... He is doubtful, but not foolhardy... He is courageous, but not without fear... Spade uses everyone he comes in contact with... He wins not because he's smarter than his enemies, but because he is the only character in a central position... Spade is every bit as ruthless as the crooks who try to use him... His tactics in dealing with them, however, are necessary for his survival...<br /><br />His treatment of the two women in the film seems equally as harsh, but neither is a wide eyed innocent and both attempt to deceive him in one manner or another... His exchanges with Brigid O'Shaughnessy are electric... Their mutual attraction is undeniable... But Spade will play the fool for no woman... He is a loner, but he has contacts, and knows where to go for what he wants... Even with very little money, he is totally incorruptible... He has no apparent friends... He is laconic, but he can throw a wisecrack as fast as he can throw a punch...<br /><br />"The Maltese Falcon" molded the image we remember of Bogart all through the early years of the Forties--an image elaborated upon and reinforced in "Casablanca," and the one which all Bogart fans remember with great affection and admiration...</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJB9J5O5CLPB.html">A2HJB9J5O5CLPB</a><br/><p>My annual viewing of my favorite detective film of all time was at hand.

In fact, Dash co-wrote the script and much of the novel's dialogue is uttered by the likes of Bogey, Mary Astor, Sid Greenstreet and Peter Lorrie.  In Hammet's world, everyone is lying.  This is the first Noir film, dark and cynical. There's something in my drink.  John Houston shoots it without thrills.  There aren't any fancy Orwellian shots, so for that reason, some film schools are snobby about this film.  All the scenes take place in a Hollywood set including exteriors.<br /><br />Ah, but the characters drive this 41 Chevy coupe.  Sam Spade is the American.  Bogart refines this icon character a few years later in Casablanca.  Spade has seen it all and he doesn't stick his neck out for nobody unless his code is lanced.

The result is a delightful film in which private investigator  Sam Spade (Bogart) attempts to answer a series of questions which somehow seem much more important to him than they do to those who see this film. The screenplay is based on one of Hammett's novels and was written by John Huston. This is also the first film Huston directed. He and Bogart worked together on four other classics: Key Largo  and The Treasure of Sierra Madre (both released in 1948), The African Queen (1951), and Beat the Devil (1953). If anything, I find this film even more amusing now than I did when I first saw it. How about the names of the characters? Miss Wonderly/Brigid O'Shaughnessy (Astor), Joel Cairo (Lorre), and Kaspar Gutman (Greenstreet). Someone's tongue was firmly in the nearest cheek. The plot makes little (if any) sense but who cares? The film's greatness is explained by the consistently superior acting and by the dialogue which never loses its Snap! Crackle! and Pop! To his great credit, amidst all the harmless nonsense, Bogart maintains his gravitas. He seems genuinely interested in "getting to the truth" to explain why his partner was murdered, why the Maltese Falcon is so valuable, etc. We tag along so as not to miss any of his interactions with a truly colorful cast of characters. Yes, that's Elisha Cook, Jr. in the role of Wilmer Cook. (No relation.) And yes, that's Huston's father Walter as Captain Jacobi. If you have not already seen it, why wait? If you have, see it again. Somehow it gets better and better, time after time, year after year after year.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>While at first glance it may seem that you don't get all that much in the quantity department with this DVD, that's really not the case.  You get a crisp, gorgeous print of the film; an edition of Robert Osbourne's &quot;Becoming Attractions&quot; that is over 40 minutes long and gives you an overview of Bogart's career by showing about a dozen of his film trailers linked by some interesting commentary; a nice little print essay on the mystery genre; and separate and distinct trailers (that is, they're not part of the Osbourne piece) for both &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; and &quot;Satan Met a Lady&quot;.  The latter was one of the earlier adaptations of &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;, with the slight difference being that the producers apparently decided to turn it into a goofy comedy!  Looking at the two trailers, one gets an immediate education about how different producers can take the same book and come up with wildly different takes on it.  Anyway, this DVD is well worth picking up, especially for the price.  One final observation, about the film itself:  &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; is a classic for twenty-three different reasons, but here's one of those smaller reasons that I especially like: one of the major characters, Floyd Thursby, wasn't even cast!  The innovative screenplay makes him a major protagonist without even showing him; we get a complete sense of him from the way the other characters describe him and his actions.  In other words, Thursby is right there with the rest of the classic characters- provoking responses, impacting on the action- even though we don't actually see him. Neat, huh?</p></br></body></html>

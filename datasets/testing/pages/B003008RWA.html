I work in health care and I am very aware of some of the screwed-up issues out there. I see physicians' hands tied by insurance companies, I see physicians' costs for liability insurance climbing and payment for health care declining. Even with that insider knowledge, Sicko curled my toes. I'm sure there are two sides of the story. But I don't see the other side in my day job and Sicko opens the flood gates on horror stories. I cried and I grew enraged at the stories that were shared in this documentary. I do not agree with the cover endorsement that mentions laughter, don't think this is rollicking comedy. Sure, there is a hint of humor, but the situations shared are tragedies.<br /><br />Methodically Moore reveals the process of health insurance from application to final payment or non-payment of claims. If you hate the big business mind set and profit hunger of insurance companies and are currently insured in case you have an increase in blood pressure, you'll want to watch this film. He then investigates why we are in the situation we are, and how other countries handle health care. If you are a documentary fan, this is quite a film.<br /><br />Moore has strong opinions. I've only seen Bowling for Columbine and Sicko but in Moore's world Canada seems to hold the answers to America's problems. The American political system/government is painted as corrupt, even a segment on Hilary Clinton that begins with her as the misunderstood warrior for health care reform ends with her political campaign being financed in part by health care dollars. Moore travels the world and digs deep into the issues that are part of the problem.<br /><br />Sicko tells a horrific story. But it's a story that is one that needs to be looked into and not ignored.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>I've really become skeptical of the extent to which films can affect change.<br /><br />Heres what we should do:<br /><br />(I'm assuming YOU are not a Right-wing dummy, blinded by hate of Micheal Moore and hopelessly ignorant about how our economic system and politics hurt the American people. "The market" doesn't solve everything. Quite the contrary.)<br /><br />OK. After watching this documentary your going to feel upset. And you should. If you don't feel anything -- immediately make an appointment to see a doctor. A shrink actually. Because you might be a sociopath. Well, if your like a shockingly large number of Americans, nevermind. You ain't got the money to see a shrink and even if you have health insurance in all probability your not covered. Good luck.<br /><br />After watching this film, get other people to watch it. Watch it with other people and talk about it.<br /><br />And then TAKE ACTION. Do something. Do many things if you have the time after working your butt off all day.<br /><br />Micheal Moore made a great film. It's arguably even his best. His role is to spread the word and reveal the ugly, dysfunctional, mean, dark side of America. And he does his job well and in personal and entertaining fashion. The thing is, all the great documentaries you watch, and articles and books you read, don't add up to nothing if all we do is sit around and whine about it.<br /><br />So, get up and do something. Write Congress. Support candidates that will work to change things. Support groups and organizations that are working to change the health care system in America anyway you can. And we should see what we can do in our private life helping out neighbors and folks in our city that do not receive adequate care that would otherwise help them to lead a more healthy and dignified life. I don't mean to preach, but "Sicko" was in the theaters and is out on DVD, it got a nod from the Academy, and so what?</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>Filmatic Agent Provocateur Michael Moore aims his camera at the sore spot of America's Healthcare System in his latest documentary, "Sicko." It's not a pretty sight. The first half of the movie could easily move you to tears, as Moore introduces us to many middle-class, insured citizens for whom the failure of Health Care ended in tragic results. Note that the focus is NOT on the almost 45 million citizens who don't have insurance, but on the citizens who, because they obediently pumped their money into monthly premiums, thought they were protected if things were to turn bad.<br /><br />Moore then finds former workers in the industry who admit their work with regrets, like the caseworker who describes how his job was to turn over as many rocks as possible in your past to make sure your claims could be declined. Or in one case, declined retroactively with a demand that YOU (the patient) make restitution. One of the major differences between "Sicko" and past Moore ventures, like "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008DDVV">Bowling for Columbine</a>," is that there are no big name targets here. No CEO is backed into a corner and harangued with a camera. One of the cheif talking heads is little more than an old lion of the British Labour party, Tony Benn, who delivers the quote I used to headline this review (to a loud round of applause in the theater I watched "Sicko"). Benn and Che Guevara's daughter are maybe the most prominent names here, and that says a lot. This isn't about famous people or Charleton Heston. These are just everyday folks forced into impossible situations with little more than a rubber stamp to mortally wound them - as one very telling news-clip reveals. As such, this becomes some of Moore's best work.<br /><br />But then again, this is a Michael Moore movie, so there has to be some sort of grandstand. It comes when Moore loads a boat of seriously ill people on a trip to Cuba to point out that our "9/11 Heroes" are getting stuck with treatment worse than that of Al-Qaeda prisoners held in Guantanamo. Even more humiliating is watching how these people, denied all their government help merely because they weren't officially government employees, are left resorting to ticket raffles in the local corner bars of their neighborhoods. (To quote Bill Maher, "We call them heroes, but we treat them like chumps.")<br /><br />When Reggie, the female 9/11 worker with some sort of inflamed throat/lung issues, discovers that an inhalant that costs her $125 of her disability/SS pay goes for a nickle in Cuba is brought to tears, the obvious propaganda value the Cuban government saw in Moore's presence shakes the honesty of the scene. Which is something of the point...if a country that we despise so deeply and has such internal turmoil can keep a world-class medical system running for all its citizens for free, what then does this say about us? Especially when, in the film's next heartbreaking segment, we are forced to watch a recent silent security camera video of a patient pushed out of a taxi on Los Angeles' Skid Row with little more than a hospital gown because she would not result in a profit?<br /><br />I am one of many people who has medical-care nightmares to relate, none as tragic as those brought to light in Moore's "Sicko," but enough to have destroyed my credit rating for several years. When you contrast this to the Health Care employees who recount that they were given bonus incentives for the number of claims they denied (as opposed to the English Doctors who are given incentives for the number of patients they cure) and the amounts of money shown paid to Health Care CEOs, "Sicko" will make you think twice about that lingering queasiness viewing this movie can cause.</p></br><a href="../users/ADS5APY1NKTL4.html">ADS5APY1NKTL4</a><br/><p>Though, it took me a few years to finally get around to watching this film, I am so glad that I did. As they say, it is better late than never. Or, in my case, it was right on time. Spending years as a care giver for my grandmother, with my mom, for well over a decade, I know well the state of our nation's health care situation - not only in terms of trips to the emergency room, but, also how support is offered (or not at all) to those in the position of either requiring care or merely offering respite to those primarily responsible.<br /><br />Michael Moore (Fahrenheit 9/11, Bowling for Columbine) presents an excellent framework for this very important film on an invaluably important topic. We see the stark realities of people in our nation of the United States - how people who have horrific injuries/accidents (example: losing a finger in a saw accident) are forced to choose WHICH finger to save because of the great cost to the patient (I am talking tens of thousands of dollars) for one digit alone!  We see how health care is being regulated in nations like France, England and Cuba. Though, the generalized message that keeps resurfacing over and over is that the United States is a waste land, in terms of patient care (that includes how insurance companies run their shady games with people who have terminal conditions (like cancer), and many have criticized him for his heroic portrayal of Cuba (yes, for some, this is still a country that the United States has no business even interacting with due to the Castro dictatorship and other factors), this film is a very important slice of life piece. We see how cold hearted the so called "caring profession" has become, as well as being preposterous and even laughable in its practices - example: charging a newborn baby for his own DELIVERY.  Many of the examples Moore presents as dysfunctional instances (that are only the tip of the ice berg) in our United States culture and the interactions between patient/client/customer, doctor/doctor's office and insurance provider leave me nothing short of speechless. Some of the accounts (presented here in interview/testimony) seemed more than a little parallel to the practices of the mafia and how they feel comfortable cutting people/connections no longer "of use" to them - politically speaking, ethically speaking. It definitely gave me a new awareness of the effect of no insurance on the lives of thousands upon thousands of people with chronic health conditions, diseases and afflictions.<br /><br />Though, on the other hand, as I see how health care practices are abroad (Europe, Cuba), I had to ask myself just how fair those depictions were/are  (as well as how accurate). I recall Moore was harshly criticized for the consistent tone throughout the piece that the United States is basically a miserable excuse for a nation, in terms of our health care practices, and how virtually every other country on this planet presented in the film is staggeringly superior and more aware of the importance of compassion, service and professionalism, as well as ethical responsibility. A perfect example is in England, when he depicts the experience of a patient in the Emergency Room/Urgent Care unit as opposed to the experience of an American in the United States, having to maneuver the system here. In that European nation, he illustrated the wait time as being smooth (almost non existent), that medication was free and the attention to the individual was perhaps most important of all. Also, he presents an instance where a young American woman defects to Canada, purely for health care purposes - even is willing to marry a Canuck to seal the deal.<br /><br />As always, Michael Moore intersperses dashes of his rollicking sense of humor with cold, hard facts about the state of global health care practices (granted, this was several years ago). I recommend you see this film for its historical merit, also for its engaging approach to storytelling.  Bravo, Mr. Moore. Bravo.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>Michael Moore documentary, as you know. Like most of his movies, I think he's too one-sided, thus negating his overall argument. But this isn't as biased as Fahrenheit 911, where his 10% over-the-top allowed critics to attack the whole movie. You just know that things aren't quite as bad in US health system as he makes out, and not as perfect in the other countries as he makes out. (I'm sure you can find people in Canada, England, France and Cuba that have their own horror stories as well.) That being said, it's still a powerful and persuasive movie that genuinely asks the question - "Is this really the best we can do?"</p></br><a href="../users/A3HM5G9IV1FTFP.html">A3HM5G9IV1FTFP</a><br/><p>This film is incendiary, polarizing, engrossing, and at times sensationalistic. But I'm grateful for it. Whether or not you agree that America should adopt a universal health care program, I'm hoping that people like Moore bringing the topic into the mainstream will help perpetuate a dialogue about American health care, which, I think most people can agree, seems to be heading quickly to ruin.<br /><br />What the film does a good job of pointing out is that there seems to be a fundamental conflict between the health care profession, which is about healing and preventing illness, and the business world. Insurance companies make more money when they are able to find ways to deny people's claims. The result is the kind of horror stories that "Sicko" puts on display.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6X0DAM87GN4.html">A3C6X0DAM87GN4</a><br/><p>There's a saying, the best way to judge a country is by the way it treats the poor and sick. I hope other countries have number one, never heard of this saying and number two, never see this movie. Michael Moore's "Sicko" is a harsh look at the U.S. health-care system and the government's inability to take care of its citizens.<br /><br /> Moore's documentary is not about the 47 million Americans who are uninsured. Instead the film is about those who are insured but have fallen through the cracks of the system. When injured they are usually denied on their claims and are left to pay for medical expenses themselves. The film has a host of incidents in which this has happened. One man accidently cuts off two of his fingers with a power saw. The hospital tells he is only covered for one. He must pick which one he wants put back on. One of his fingers will cost $60,000 the other $12,000. He decides to go with the $12,000 finger as the other one is thrown away.<br /><br /> Stories such as this one are countered with stories from people from other countries including Canada, London and France where the citizens have universal health-care. They laugh at Moore when he asked them how much a visit to the hospital cost. When he asks them "why are you laughing"? They say because they've never been asked such a question.<br /><br /> I'm a big fan of Moore's films. I enjoyed his last film "Fahrenheit 9/11". I thought it was one of the best films of 2004. I also liked "Bowling for Columbine". While I don't think the film is as good as "Fahrenheit 9/11" just because it wasn't as rabble rousing to me, "Sicko" is still a call for action. It filled me with contempt. Why can't America help and take care of all of us. Why are millions of people, including myself, without health-care. My job doesn't even offer me coverage because I work part-time. If God forbid something should happen to me, I don't even want to think what would happen to me.<br /><br /> Lots of people complain Michael Moore hates America, in fact a movie was made about Moore with that exact same title, but why? Because he exposes unpleasant truths about this country? Well, isn't that just too bad. I feel it's more of an injustice if someone sees something wrong in this country and says nothing then if someone speaks out, even if others don't want to hear it.<br /><br /> Is Moore's film fair and balanced? Probably not. No big shots from the medical companies are interviewed. No doctors, well Americans ones anyway, are either. Moore doesn't try to explain their side at all. It is a completely one-sided agrument. But, guess what? I don't want to hear their excuses. Moore makes it very simple when he says HMO's are strickly out to make profit. They don't want to pay for your medical expenses. That is considered a "medical lost". The object is to take all of your money and never provide you with coverage. When dealing with "people" like that, who wants to hear their side? How do you justify such behavior? We understand all we need to know. They are money hungry. It's business, it's not personal. All they see is dollar and cents. We see people suffer.<br /><br /> I don't know if this was Moore's intention, it probably wasn't, but this was the first film I ever saw which convinced me to want to live in another country. When you see the way people in Canada and France live, for instance, did you know they get five weeks of paid vacation? A week's paid vacation for their honeymoon? The government sends someone to help new mom's take care of their children for no charge? Doctors make house calls? Who wouldn't want such benefits. And the kicker is, they work a 35 hour week! I already have a passport, I'm just packing my bags.<br /><br /> Many people claim the film is Moore's best. As I said, I don't agree, but, the documentary will make you look at the world differently. It will make you think. It is a call for action. Moore doesn't explore all the details. Like, how much in taxes does all this cost? Moore never interviews truly poor and sick people from these other countries, he only interviews sick people from America. Is it because of our health-care system we have all these sick people and these other countries don't or did Moore do this on purpose just to make his point? Either way, I don't care. It's just something to think about.<br /><br /> In the end "Sicko" is one of the year's best films. It was an incredible experience for me which changed the way I look at the world and the direction I want to lead my life. Will others have the same experience? Will they be as struck by this film as I was? Who knows. If they've ever been sick they might.<br /><br /> Bottom-line: This harsh look at the U.S. health-care system is one of the year's best. It is a call of action and will get your emotions going into high gear.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PR6NXG0PA3KY.html">A2PR6NXG0PA3KY</a><br/><p>This isn't a five-star film. It's spotty, sloppy, and self-indulgent, more a diatribe than a documentary. My five-star rating is a vote of solidarity with Michael Moore's position: that American health care as a system is inadequate and unworthy of a modern nation. Moore is a 'muckraker' in the honorable tradition of American journalism, and there's plenty of 'muck' to be raked in America, the only wealthy Western democracy that doesn't support a system of universal health care. Moore's targets are the profit-driven insurance companies - HMOs chiefly - the greedy drug companies, and the special-interest 'bagmen' in Congress, from both parties, who collaborate in keeping American health care expensive and inequitable. America and the American people spend more money, both in aggregate and per capita, on health care than any other nation, yet America lags in most statistics of health care quality, and that's a sickening state of affairs.<br /><br />However, what's "sickening" about Sicko is that it won't persuade those people who have virulently resisted health care reform in the USA. Those who already recognize the failures of for-profit, insurance-dominated health care will applaud Moore's witty cinematography, but those who deny that the system needs reform will latch onto Moore's personal idiosyncrasies and partialities as evidence that health care reform is a big-government intrusion and a socialist plot against Mom and Apple Pie.<br /><br />Some Americans enjoy very good health care. I do, when I happen to be in the USA. I have Kaiser Permanente coverage, which has been fully adequate to cover two very expensive procedures for me, but Kaiser Permanente is one of the villains in this film. Yes, Kaiser and other HMOs are guilty of the misdeeds Moore exposes, but his depiction of them is too one-sided, too selective. Anyone who has had good experiences with Kaiser, as I have, will be skeptical of Moore's integrity. That's 'sickening' because Moore is basically correct. Insurance-managed health care is unfair, capricious, supremely inflationary, and above all UNAVAILABLE for millions of people. The Constitution of the USA pledges the federal government to "promote the general welfare" of the People, a commitment to a sense of community that is not fulfilled by a system of health care that excludes the poorest and sickest.<br /><br />Moore is also too one-sided in his portrayal of the universal health care systems of other countries, particularly of Canada, France, and Cuba. It is true that those countries provide free or nearly free health care to everybody, despite any 'pre-existing conditions' and despite the disqualification of poverty. It's true that citizens of those countries enjoy a sense of security that many Americans lack. It's true that statistics demonstrate better results - lower infant mortality, greater longevity, better overall health - in those countries than in the opulent USA. But it's also true that the national health care systems of Canada and Europe are far from perfect. There are long waits for procedures, MRIs for instance, in Canada. There are complaints, angry complaints about health care in Germany and England -- as there are of course in Massachusetts and Hawaii -- but Michael Moore doesn't report those complaints. His one-sidedness weakens his case.<br /><br />I've experienced health care needs abroad, by the way, for myself in Spain and Germany, for my family in France and Canada. I've gotten effective, prompt, courteous treatment of urgent medical problems like strep throat in Spain, with no paperwork and no hassle. My family has gotten house calls from doctors in France, as Moore depicts. The right wing insurance-industry propaganda against 'socialized' health care in Europe is just as deceptive and unscrupulous as Moore declares. National Health Care is effective and economical in ways that profit-driven health care can't duplicate. I only wish Michael Moore could have made a more convincing case for it.<br /><br />Ex-Vice President Dick Cheney famously accused Michael Moore, at the Republican Convention in 2004, of being disingenuous. That might seem like 'the pot calling the kettle black' since Cheney has been proven to be a consummate opportunist of disinformation. But it's also inaccurate. Moore is anything but disingenuous; his positions and his intentions are always blatantly clear. In this film, when he briefly poses as the Devil's Advocate for American health care, he's utterly unconvincing. He can direct, but he can't act. His ingenuousness is painful at times; for instance, he delivers one of his strongest endorsements of socialized medicine -- yes, he IS a socialist! -- with a bust of Karl Marx visible behind him. What's disingenuous about that? Unfortunately, many 'conservative' Americans will react to such deliberate honesty as mere provocation. Moore would do better not to taunt his adversaries, assuming that his goal is to persuade them.<br /><br />But then, is the goal of Sicko really to persuade or to entertain? In the end, it fails of one and succeeds at the other.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N6GAJTEOF4MO.html">A3N6GAJTEOF4MO</a><br/><p>When thinking about it most people outside the U.S. would be shocked and appalled at the blatant uncaring nature of the American Health Service. I can't honestly imagine being denied Health Care because of money troubles. I suppose that I should consider myself lucky that I live in the UK, a country that puts a persons health before a profit.<br /><br />Many people claim Moore to be a propagandist who's just utilising this subject matter in order to make a quick dollar. That may be true, but there's no denying that he brings to light some of the real injustices of the world. Fahrenheit 9/11 was Moore's biggest success and became the most successful documentary of all time. That was for a reason. It showed the blatant government corruption and stupidity when relating to the 9/11 attacks and the war on terror. Sicko is along the same lines, yet it focuses on government corruption, stupidity and greed when relating to the health of the American people.<br /><br />Sicko is a two hour piece that manages to hold my attention throughout, even for a documentary. It gives a good blend of true life emotional stories and satirical interviewing when Moore, playing the stupid American, interviews Doctors in countries that have free health care. One of the more shocking segments is showing that Hillary Rodham Clinton used to fight for free universal Health care. It shows how she was bought out by the American Medical Association, simply showing that even those who pretend to care have a price.<br /><br />We are given an insight into the insurance companies who claim they exist through simply caring for the people. That's not the case though, as we were given a list of pre-existing medical conditions which could exempt an American citizen from getting insured. It showed how actual Doctors who got into profession to help people, were denying insurance claims simply to make the companies more money. At times this would even cost a patient their life.<br /><br />During the documentary we are also shown how Americans were convinced universal Health care was a bad idea, by labelling it Socialist Medical Care. This idea convinced people that if they didn't have the type of system that have today, then it would take away their freedom to choose which doctor they could be treated by or which Hospital they could be treated in. In this a video is played which shows how this system first began through the power of Richard Nixon. This system was brought about through the idea that giving people less care would increase profits. The land of the free and home of the brave indeed.<br /><br />A truly shocking and at times upsetting documentary that everyone needs to see. The sad thing is that Moore's documentary wont change a thing with the Medical system.</p></br><a href="../users/AJRFZ0VZ0LD26.html">AJRFZ0VZ0LD26</a><br/><p>As presidential primaries are gaining their full speed and candidates are presenting their plan for the new America, they are talking about the issues of today.  Although most would want us to believe that this year's elections are about "the economy, stupid", I believe that this should be defining campaign year and presidential election for the very important issue of our nation which is health care.  As all Michael Moore documentaries, this one attacks the establishement about the widely pushed indoctrination to the masses that universal health care equals socialized medicine for the likes of Eastern Europe (i.e. read socialized medicine).  We see that countries like: France, UK and Canada have prospered by implementing nationalized health care.  Even Cuba takes care of their citizens, while our citizens get complimentary taxi drop off from the hospitals unwilling to treat patients who either do not have insurance, or can no longer afford their deductables.  I only wish this film re-emerges as the presidential elections reach November.  People need to be educated about how our current health system is really working for us as it is setup today.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>Moore presents a very serious issue facing all Americans whether or not they have health insurance in a very entertaining light.  If what he presents is true, then the American public has been lied to especially concerning "socialized" medicine in other countries.<br /><br />During the documentary Moore went to four countries including Cuba and he expounds that medicine in these places is far superior to what is available or not available to the American public here in the US.  The documentary opens a lot of questions that demand answers, even if what is presented as "fact" is not quite "fact."<br /><br />Excellently presented!</p></br><a href="../users/A9L6L5H9BPEBO.html">A9L6L5H9BPEBO</a><br/><p>No matter what people may think of Michael Moore, they will be hard-pressed to counter his film "Sicko" with one of a contrarian view. I suppose "Sickohype" or Sickohypo" or "Let'em all Die" just doesn't have the same resonance as "Fahrenhype" did to challenge his previous film.<br /><br />Perhaps as landmark as Jacob Riis's "How the Other Half Lives," "Sicko" brings the devastating cost and state of health care in this country to light beginning with people who have lived the American dream and expected to live their retirement independently and in comfort. Early on, Moore shows a working couple forced to sell their home to meet medical obligations not covered, and now depend on the charity of their children. Moore carefully singles out several cases of the twenty-five thousand emails he received that reveal the appalling state of health care in a country that nurtures that dream. (None of the stories or emails are about couples in separate bathtubs looking out over a vineyard).<br /><br />First are the insurance companies that are out to make a profit. (Nothing's wrong with that). However, the profit is at the expense of the medical coverage and preventative care they can deny. If they cannot deny it outright or claim such care is experimental, they will pour through a patient's medical history to see if any condition occurred that was not mentioned or remembered in the application process. This will give the company the means to deny all claims retroactively. Incidentally, doctors receive bonuses for the most claims they can deny!<br /><br />The next spotlight is on the pharmaceutical companies which are so expensive that many people must continue working well beyond their retirement years, years they should be enjoying, years when there is the greatest need for medication. In particular, Moore singles out the very new and complicated prescription plan, which is more expensive for seniors than ever before, but benefits the pharmaceuticals. (Thank you, Mr. Bush).<br /><br />Besides our illustrious president benefitting from the contributions of pharmaceuticals, Moore identifies a host of other republicans who have had their hands in drug company pockets--including the lady who was going to provide universal health care in the first place--Hillary Clinton whose plan the drug companies spent $100,000,000 to defeat. Fourteen staffers who worked on the Seniors' Prescription bill, moved on to lucrative lobby positions with the same companies, and Billy Tauzin was hired as CEO for Pharma at $2,000,000 a year. In any other milieu, that is called bribery, corruption, and conflict of interest. In Congress, it's called the cost of doing business.<br /><br />But what gives Americans a strong sense of pride is our belief that our medical system and healthcare, while flawed, is the finest in the world. Moore is quick to write "denied" all over that fantasy. We see in Canada, Great Britain, and France, how people receive first rate health care, from first rate physicians without having to sell their homes, decide which finger they can afford to save, and have a higher life expectancy than Americans. (Doctors in Britain are actually paid more for getting people into better health habits and regimens).<br /><br />Misnamed socialized medicine by its detractors, socialized insurance works in these countries efficiently without people crowding in waiting rooms, being taxed to death (as the health companies would have us believe), or dying because they cannot afford the medication, or because the insurance company denied their claim. Moore implies that paying higher taxes makes more sense than losing your homes or retirement to catastrophic illness in what is now the leading cause of bankruptcy in the country.<br /><br />Moore's direction is flawless. His graphics and humor are engaging; dry and deprecating. This is a film that may make you well-up with tears that a society could take such good care of its companies and business, and dump its destitute on the street. Moore succeeds in making you feel empathy for those who are poorly treated or not at all. He is able to make you think: "Can that happen to me?" or "If it can work there, why can't it work here?"<br /><br />The special edition also offers more in-depth discussion of health care that could not be put in the original film. This includes conversations with people on the street, HR 636 brought before the house, Norway which has the highest standard of health care in the world. (Yes, it is free). Sadly it also shows some of the people from the film whose family members died for lack of treatment, or because they were turned away.<br /><br />The final irony of the film is one of the more poignant. The man who runs the most virulent anti-Michael Moore website announced that he would have to shut down because he couldn't afford the hospital care his wife so desperately needed.<br /><br />Guess what Moore did.<br /><br />God bless us everyone.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>47 million people are without health insurance. The United States is ranked just above many third world nations in terms of its overall health care. The average life expectancy in the U.S. is three years less than in Canada. Moore rattles off some interesting statistics about the business of health care. He focuses, however, on individuals who have health care with conditions that are denied routine treatment because they suddenly become "experimental" or retroactively deny benefits that have been approved because a health insurnace company has found a loop hole. Moore's film has its own editorial point of view or slant (how could it not?) whether or not you agree with him will largely depend upon your experience with health care in this country and the impact the film makes on you.<br /><br />I particularly found touching the vingette on the woman who's husband was denied a bone marrow transplant because it was "experimental". The man's brother was a match and it looked good that he would have a chance. He died after his last chance at treatment was denied.<br /><br />There is also a story about a woman who had a daughter denied treatment because she was taken to an ER that didn't take their health insurance. While that is unusual, it documents the corporate issues that can contribute to the death of a child.<br /><br />While socialized medicine may not be the key here (there are plenty of complaints about waiting lists for treatment, limits on doctors, etc.), we need to have a way to untie coverage from employment and allow patients to receive reliable, good coverage from haalth insurance companies. More importantly, though, we need to have ethical reviews of practices to may sure this fiasco doesn't occur again for patients presented in the film.<br /><br />More of an editorial than a documentary, Michael Moore's "Sicko" although far from perfect, provides an education on the problems within the health care system in the United States. Politics always play a part in any discussion of health care and this one is no different. There are those who disagree with Moore that our health care system is broken and just as many that suggest we could take a lesson from other nations about how the to effectively treat others with universal health care.<br /><br />The film comes with a number of special features including "Sicko Goes to Washington" where Moore went to nation's capitol to see if the Rep. John Conyers sponsored bill HR 676 to reform the health care system could be passed. We hear some horrible stories and see some of the actions that CNA (California Nurse's Association) and others are taking to try and change things.<br /><br />"This Country Beats France" focuses on Norway where health care is the #1 country for literacy, education and healthcare as well as per capita income. We rank #66.<br /><br />"Uniquely American" focuses on the community fundraiser to help the sick.<br /><br />"What If You Worked for GE in France?" looks at benefits working for an American company where employees get five weeks paid vacation, RTT days in France, works 35 hours a week and gets other benefits WE as Americans don't enjoy. Clearly I need to move to France.<br /><br />We also get the Hollywood premiere of the movie and a music video. Moore also had a premiere in Skid Row in L.A. at the same time as the Hollywood premiere with all the celebrities.<br /><br />"Sister Mary Fidel" and "Who Would Jesus Deny?", "More with Mike & Tony Benn" and an interview gallery round out the special features for this set.<br /><br />Every documentary has its point-of-view and editorial slant. Michael Moore's film "Sicko" is no different in that regard. However, Moore's take on health care in the United States is on target more often than not and the inaccuracies are pretty minor overall. Sure, there is no idealized perfect health care system. There are better ones than we currently have in the United States.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>*<br />Michael Moore sucks. And "Sicko", his latest liberal attack on the government is more of the same. Don't waste your money.<br /><br />Hmmm. Hum. Hmmm. Hmmmm<br /><br />Okay, are all of the Michael Moore bashers out of the room? Good. Now we can actually discuss the film "Sicko".<br /><br />****<br /><br />If you have seen any of Moore's previous films, "Sicko" will look familiar. Moore combines a number of moving stories of real people with a number of segments where he serves as a `roving reporter' and tries to get to the bottom of certain issues. Expectations for this new film are high, based on the enormous success of his last film "Fahrenheit 9/11". Because of the subject matter, and the enormous amount of press, both good and bad, "9/11" became the most successful documentary ever. When I went to see the film, I bought my tickets in advance and still had to wait in line due to the sheer volume of people trying to get in to see the film. "Sicko" is similar in tone and feel to his previous film, but it isn't quite the same hot button issue and will not receive the same amount of press, publicity, or dollars.<br /><br />Many people attack Michael Moore's films because they are "documentaries". "Well, they don't tell the truth". "He's a liar". A documentary, any documentary, has to have a point of view. We have to know why the filmmaker is telling their story. Why is this idea important to them? If they don't have or exhibit a point of view, the film would be a pointless waste of your time and money. It wouldn't be compelling. You may disagree with some or all of the filmmaker's point of view, but at least they have one.<br /><br />Moore has taken on some hot-button topics in his films. I think he does this for two reasons; because he wants to help make people aware of these problems and encourage them to act and also because he knows he will create more publicity by attacking them. As the old saying goes, there is no such thing as bad publicity. So, Moore has taken on gun control, big corporations and the George W. Bush presidency, all in an attempt to give us more information and to try to prompt us to take action. Because of his previous films, Moore is not exactly a sight any one running a company wants to see coming at them. In fact, I think I might have an accident if I saw Moore headed towards me holding a microphone. What did I do wrong?<br /><br />In "Sicko", Moore turns his camera on the health care industry. Or, as he has said in a number of interviews, the lack of such. He talks to a number of people about their problems. One woman shows pictures of her car after an accident. Then, we see the bill and learn the insurance company denied her claim for an ambulance because it wasn't pre-approved. As she comments "When was I supposed to have it pre-approved? After I regained consciousness but before they put me on the ambulance." There are a number of stories like this and they are heartbreaking.<br /><br />Why are these stories so heartbreaking? Because each of these people did what they were supposed to do. They did what we have done. They got insurance. And we could just as easily be in their shoes.<br /><br />As Moore delves deeper into the problem, he notes that insurance companies don't make money if they pay claims, so they hire people, doctors, and medical professionals, to deny whatever claims they can and to figure out new ways to deny other claims.<br /><br />Moore spends some time discussing what a `pre-existing health condition' means to these companies. After he sets this up, he shows a list of all of the pre-existing conditions, which could get your coverage denied. Worse, because some of these conditions are relatively banal, if they find out later that you have one of them, after paying out a claim, they may deny the claim and sue you to get the money back. The list of `pre-existing' conditions is extensive and runs a long time, even at the accelerated speed we see in the film.<br /><br />There is also a segment dealing with Hilary Clinton's stewardship of the Universal Health Care initiative she tried to get off the ground when her husband was President. Not surprisingly, the plan never materialized. Now, with Hilary the Democratic front-runner, and using this as a campaign talking point again, it might come as a surprise what Moore reveals in "Sicko". But then again, it probably shouldn't surprise you that much.<br /><br />And Moore visits other Western countries already employing the concept of Universal Healthcare. In visits to Great Britain and France, he finds that people receive the health care they need but more importantly, they receive the preventative care they need. As he talks to people in these countries and they reveal the extent of this coverage and what it means to them, I defy you to not allow your mouth to drop open. As he talked to more and more people in Paris, both French citizens and American ex-patriots living there, and they revealed more and more of the benefits they currently receive, I was ready to pack my bags.<br /><br />As Moore tells us one story after another of normal, ordinary, everyday people and their problems with the healthcare industry, he really tugs at the heartstrings. These are people just like you and me. Their problems could happen to any one of us as well.<br /><br />Then, Moore turns his attention to a sampling of 9/11 Rescue Workers. The NYC Firemen and Policemen who rushed to the scene are presumably covered by their respective health care plans. But what about all of the other people who rushed down there to lend a hand? All of the people in the Armed Forces? The good Samaritans? All of the people who volunteered their efforts to help save people? These people didn't hesitate to help out. In the process, they also breathed the toxic fumes and are now experiencing many of the same ailments many of New York's finest are living with. But are they getting any medical help? As Moore illustrates with a sound bite from Governor Pataki, they will be covered provided they can prove they were there, they spent a certain amount of time there, they helped out with the rescue effort, they sign an affidavit, etc. How many volunteers who were involved with such a chaotic event can provide proof of their participation?<br /><br />Moore also learns the detainees at Guantanamo Bay receive full health care, including preventative medicine and this doesn't add up for the filmmaker. The people who helped out during the rescue effort can't get the medical care they need but the people suspected of causing the harm can? Moore grabs his subjects and they travel to Miami. He rents a boat and they make their way to Guantanamo Bay. It is an amusing piece and the story continues from there to show how these same people are treated when they actually arrive in Cuba.<br /><br />This last bit is also pretty typical Moore, and, I suspect, a point that drives many of his critics crazy. It is a staged bit, much like when he ambushed Charlton Heston for a scene in "Bowling for Columbine", and it is debatable whether it has a place in a documentary. But Moore is trying to make a point and while the set-up may be artificial, the outcome is what he wants to show. And it is an effective argument.<br /><br />"Sicko" is a very good, funny, emotional look at a corrupt part of our community. It doesn't pack the emotional wallop of "Fahrenheit 9/11" or address as incendiary a hot-button topic, but it is a very good conversation starter nonetheless.<br /><br />Now, hopefully people will go out and talk and come up with a solution to the problem.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3.html">A1ER5AYS3FQ9O3</a><br/><p>This film highlights a subject that many of us intuitively understand or have experienced through the years - our health care system is in crisis and it can be a struggle to get claims covered, even if you have decent insurance. For those without insurance, it is a horror story.<br /><br />I related to this movie because I know that simply keeping track of the paperwork and communicating between the doctors and the insurance company takes a great deal of my time. It didn't used to. Something, indeed, has changed for the worst.<br /><br /> For one thing, companies often delay payments until a patient's credit rating is in peril or impacted. I have seen friends have to bug insurance companies, in spite of the fact that they are paying premiums to these companies, to pay on time even when paperwork is properly submitted. This should not be. The company should be doing its job, insuring those who need their services, paying for appropriate medical care. People should not have to have their credit rating jeopardized or have to make a choice between paying the high costs themselves, somehow, even if they are financially stressed to the max...and then hope the insurance company will reimburse them..someday.<br /><br />  Listen to Linda Peeno's admission that she denied a patient proper care in spite of the fact that she knew this could cause death and that she continued to deny care in order to help a company maximize its profits - and she did so again and again, with encouragement and support by the company. I hope this will give you pause.<br /><br />  As far as personal experience goes, I left a hospital emergency room after being told nothing was seriously wrong with me. A nurse had checked the box that indicated they'd looked at the injection site where they'd taken blood and left a "tap" in case they needed to get medication into me quickly. I was instructed not to removed the gauze over the site till I got home. Imagine my surprise to discover they'd left two needles in me, taps fully in place! I actually took them out myself. So why did they check the box indicating they'd done it and that I'd been fully cleared to leave. I did negotiate a reduction on my bill but this certainly did nothing to make me feel more confident about the care I got that day. It was a minor mistake but how many more people suffer greater ones?<br /><br />  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IMVO5K">Breakdown: America's Health Insurance Crisis</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0061145823">What You Don't Know Can Kill You: A Physician's Radical Guide to Conquering the Obstacles to Excellent Medical Care</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401895956">Understanding Health Insurance: A Guide to Billing and Reimbursement</a></p></br><a href="../users/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K.html">A1S8AJIUIO6M9K</a><br/><p>Our oldest relative received a quadruple by-pass and none of us have ever had any problems with insurance, so I began the movie somewhat sceptically.  I was won over fairly quickly after that.  This is the "new new" Michael Moore, and as an estranged moderate Reblican, I attest to his value to the center.  This is a very thoughtfully put together movie, very artful in combining interviews and news clips, and I now see the depth of despair that hits those disqualified by mendacious insurance comapnies.  With the help of this movie, I now understand medical math: keep the middle happy, and screw over the poorest of the poor who fall into that smaller category of "catastrophically expensive" medicine.  In essence, the medical industry is practicing genocide/medical triage, based on income and cost, not on need.  Now that *should* be a crime.<br /><br />He opens with Ronald Reagan, one of my personal heros, and thus disconcerting to see "selling" the concept of socialized medicine to create the hospital industry.  I lunch regularly with Jim Turner, #2 Naderite who continues to do for health and food what Nader did for cars, and we talk often, not about whether health should be nationalized and universal, which we think it should, but rather about why the American Medican Association continues to focus exclusively on profitable remediation and drugs, does everything it can to conceal and drive out of business those who offer natural and alternative cures, and ignores completely the benefits of preventive medicine in the form of healthy life style and healthy environment.<br /><br />He opens his damnation of Congress by pointing out that as a Senator, Hillary Clinton was bought--her silence was bought--for $800,000.  That is one reason I think Senator Obama contrasts so  well with her: Mrs. Clinton is "old partisan polkitics," Ron Paul and Barack Obama are "new transpartisan citizen-driven" politics.<br /><br />I have four pages of notes on this movie.  I took it seriously, and I will also watch John Q now, a movie I avoided despite the great stars.<br /><br />The obscene costs of medicine are dramatically illustrated, and in one case, a person is told they can choose which of two fingers to attach, one for $40K the other for $60K.  That really IS sicko.<br /><br />The middle part of the movie is a superb review of Canadian, British, and French medicine and may have included Nordic as well.<br /><br />He returns to the US, and to point out how our current health care system has been manipulated for profit and shielded from excellence by the AMA, asking--very intelligently and pointedly--why we have such excellent police, firefighters, and teachers who are "provided."  He's right.  The AMA and Mrs. Clinton are wrong.  We need to follow the French/Cuban models (more on that at the end).<br /><br />There are some sensational and intellectually satisfying interviews in this movie.  A couple of highlights:<br /><br />+ Labor Leader in UK: US is willing to spend trillions killing others, why not spend billions healing its own?<br /><br />+ UK doctors get substantial bonuses for improving the health of their assigned sector.<br /><br />+ Giving poor the vote led to the corruption of Congress.<br /><br />+ People who are healthy, educated, and confident are harder to govern.  Both Wall Street and Washington *want* "working poor" and "fearful populations.  TIME TO END THAT.<br /><br />+ Corporations use health benefits to enslave and discourage movement.<br /><br />+ Keiser will deny coverage if the individual--not matter how acute their condition-refuses or cannot get to a hospital *owned* by Kaiser.  THAT ought to be criminal.<br /><br />+ France, by the testimony of Americans living there, is the most family-friendly country on the planet, down to providing mother's helpers so mothers can have two four hour blocks during the week to care for their house and husband without concern.<br /><br />The movie documents the scandalous misbehavior of Los Angeles hospitals of "dumping" patients, dressed only in a thin hospital gown, by taxi in the vicinity of but not directly in front of a rescue mission for the homeless.  I watched this on security video in horror.<br /><br />He then moves into 9/11 health aftermath.  I personally believe that President Bush is impeachable on a number of counts, but supressing the extreme danger of the asbestos released by the controlled demolitions of the three buildings (Larry Silverstein's dream--conspire with insurance companies to empty the building of insured gold, get a portion of the seven billions to reconstruct the WTC after it is brought down and cleared at taxpayer expense....  In my lifetime, we will see the truth come out about Bush, Cheney, Guliani, Rumsfeld and others who have disgraced our Nation--lying to the firefighters and the citizens of New York is one reason I consider Rudy "scoop and dump" Guliani to be toast.<br /><br />The movie moves to a close by discovering that terrorists being held captive at Guantanamo receive the best of medical care, free, at our expense, at the same time that 9/11 workers go begging.  There is a dramatic staged effort to reach Guantanamo via boat, then they suddenly appear in Cuba, probably via jet arranged in advance with the Cuban government.<br /><br />The movie closes with the 9/11 firefighters receiving the best free treatment on the planet, and being honored by Cuban firefighters who come to attention for them.  I was moved on a number of fronts.<br /><br />First, Cuba and the Amish have the only sustainable agricultural practices on the planet;<br /><br />Second, Cuba can afford to send 10,000 doctors to Venezuela for a prolonged period, and we cannot take care of our own.<br /><br />Third, my libertarian roots vis a vis the Federal Government are reinforced.  This is a government that makes war and betrays the trust of the American people, and I hold BOTH the Democratic and Republican partisan machines to blame.  We need Electoral Reform to include an end to the "winner take all" nonsense.<br /><br />This is a great movie.  On Monday I will be sending Michael Moore a fax outlining the Earth Intelligence Network model for healing the planet.  The model starts with the ten high level threats to humanity, among wich poverty (caused by government and industrial corruption), disease, and environmental degradation outrank war, the twelve policies (agriculture, diplomacy, economy, education, energy, family, health, immigration, justice, security, society, and water), must be addressed not just for the US and Europe, but for the eight challengers as well (Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Iran, Russia, Venezuela, and Wild Cards like Malaysia, Pakistan, South Africa, and Turkey).  If Michael Moore can repeat this success in vignette form for each of the other 29 factors. we get our country back.<br /><br />BRAVO.<br /><br />See also my reviews below and also my lists.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FBH3W2">Why We Fight</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007DBJM8">The Corporation</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BTH4K4">Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060931841">Rule by Secrecy: The Hidden History That Connects the Trilateral Commission, the Freemasons, and the Great Pyramids</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452287081">Confessions of an Economic Hit Man</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0930852370">9/11 Synthetic Terror: Made in USA, Fourth Edition</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0865715408">Crossing the Rubicon: The Decline of the American Empire at the End of the Age of Oil</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400065763">Vice: Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American Presidency</a></p></br><a href="../users/A2R6RA8FRBS608.html">A2R6RA8FRBS608</a><br/><p>Sicko is perhaps best described as an expos&eacute; by Michael Moore on the disgusting failings of the American health care industry to pay for necessary medical procedures even though their customers have paid their premiums and "played by the rules." We see heartrending stories of Americans treated cruelly, to say the least, by their health insurance carriers. Just as many other reviewers note, there are pathetic, sad stories of grown parents having to move in with their children because they went bankrupt paying for three heart attacks; and there's the story of a 79 year old man who has to work at a Pathmark supermarket doing heavy lifting so that he and his aged wife can have the medicines they need every day.<br /><br />The horror stories continue, mostly with the fat cats of the health care companies getting seven figure annual salaries based on how much health care they deny to their "customers." We learn from professionals and analysts that the less care any health insurance company gives the more money they make--and their executives get rich on this terrible truth.<br /><br />There is one scene in which a doctor tells a Congressional hearing that she is still haunted by a decision she made to deny a man a life-necessary operation. As a result of her decision she was promoted to a six figure a year job. Moore also notes that Hillary Clinton did try to get universal health care but her idea died before it could become a reality.<br /><br />Moore travels to other countries to see what they do there about insuring people's health. We learn that in Canada, England, Norway, and France, socialized medicine is quite acceptable because the citizens of these countries truly believe that they should have health care for all. Naturally, this is done through much higher taxes; but at least they never worry about a hospital stay, getting tough pre-approvals for life saving procedures and more.<br /><br />You'll easily remember the Michael Moore "stunt;" he takes rescue workers from September 11th and sails to Cuba with them so that they can get free health care at Guantanamo Bay. Fortunately for the workers they do get treated on the island although they don't get their treatment on the military base.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I must say that I think Moore painted the picture of these other countries a bit too rosy. I have friends in Holland who certainly don't live as well as the foreigners interviewed in their homes by Michael Moore. In addition, how fast you get health care in other countries often depends on how sick you are--you may have to wait ten months for a hip replacement if doctors there decide that you can wait.<br /><br />Overall, however, Michael Moore makes his case a very solid one; and I certainly agree with him on this issue. We should have at least an optional universal health care program so that people who don't want to participate don't feel forced into it.<br /><br />The DVD has a plethora of extras that really add a lot to the experience of watching the movie. There are great interview segments with Tony Benn, a former member of Britain's Parliament; and we see Moore having an "extra" premiere of his film in a Los Angeles ghetto with audience members who probably can't even afford to see the movie in a movie theater. There is more footage still of Michael Moore and legislators in Washington fighting for universal health care.<br /><br />Sicko is a fine film by Michael Moore that cries out for universal health care. Moore wants a better standard of living in America; and he hopes Americans develop more concern for other Americans--something that is very often lacking in the United States. I highly recommend this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>Some disclosure, I do not like the way that Michael Moore makes his "documentaries" and I honestly do not feel they should be in that category. For he does make sure that everything is shown to support his preconceived idea. You know that once he starts he is going to be supporting his personal view. And that is seen in this film. I know how bad Cuba's health system is for the normal person and this film does not come close to showing it. We only get to see where the elite of Cuba go for healthcare. And we do not get to see those who wait trying to get specialist care in the "free" systems like France. It would be nice to see the good and bad of each system.<br /><br />Now with all that I have to say that even though his scenes are "cherry-picked", everything that Mr. Moore shows in his film about our Insurance system is quite accurate. In the richest country in the world with the best doctors and most advanced technology we have too many people going without required care. And his includes both medical procedures and prescriptions. I have seen a five year paperwork trail of someone insured by one of the largest health insurance companies in the U.S.A., with full health coverage, that was denied coverage for a piece of durable equipment that was required. This person could not wait for insurance so the equipment was purchased and claim filed, of course the claim was denied. After the five years of appeals, including involvement by his Senator and the U.S Department of Health, the piece of equipment was approved. But guess what? A letter was sent saying they, the insurance company, would not pay for the durable equipment bought because it was the "wrong" brand!<br /><br />Most of our medical practitioners and all prescription companies have no compassion. All that matters is the bottom line, greed. We may have very good quality medical care, if you can get it that is. Having insurance is only for those who really do not need it. And even if you do have great insurance, it does not mean you are covered at all. So obviously the United States is in need of healthcare reform. And I do hope that everyone sees this film with an open mind. I know it shows only extremes, but what someone should realize that in the United States, not one citizen should have to go without required prescriptions or medical care regardless of its cost. And no one should have to choose between his or her life and their home.<br /><br />We all know nothing is free, a free system would mean increase taxes. But let us see what those taxes would be and put it on a ballot so that the people can vote on the systems they want. The taxes might not be that much higher overall. Or perhaps the single payer system. No matter what anyone thinks of Michael Moore, hopefully this fill will increase the discourse on the U.S.A.'s healthcare system. This is the best film he has produced yet.</p></br><a href="../users/ATXL536YX71TR.html">ATXL536YX71TR</a><br/><p>Does the U.S. have some of the worst health care in the world? Could it be that the "land of the free" ranks #37 concerning health care just above Slovenia? Do insurance companies "weed out" those that they predetermine to not cover? Have important politicians, who a few years back supported a move to socialized medicine in this country,been "bought" in order to have this put on the back burner? Why am I paying a $30 copay for the same medicine that last year cost me $10??? Why do some people get approved for medical procedures and others do not? Thank you Michael Moore for finally bringing these questions to the attention of a sleeping American public. If his facts are only 50% correct, then we are still in big trouble and deserve alot of explanation. DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS are both held equally responsible for this mess in Michael Moore's film, so no one should, whatever their politics,  avoid seeing this film.This is good information that equally effects all of us as Americans.Yes, I laughed and I cried as well.Yes I was entertained. Ultimately I left feeling low and concerned. I do have health coverage and stay at a dead-end job because of it,too.It would be nice to have this paid for so that I could do what I really wanted to do.As you get older in the U.S. you realize that benefits, for what they are, are essential to survival.How sad for us!God help anyone who has a catastrophic illness with no coverage. It's frightening.Are other countries panaceas? Watch the film and you decide!<br /><br />Two great movies to follow up SICKO would be  1990's THE DOCTOR with William Hurt and BEAUTIFUL DREAMERS with Colm Feore.These films were released as socialized medicine was becoming an issue under Clinton.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>I've seen all of Michael Moore's movies and I've read all of his books but none have touched me in the way that Sicko has.  First off, I want to say that I am so thankful that I'm Canadian.  I could not imagine getting sick in the US and not being able to pay for my healthcare or fight with an insurance company in what seems like a lose-lose battle.<br />I work in the Emergency Department of a hospital, actually I work in the ER at one of the hospitals featured in the movie.  This movie actually brought me to tears when I saw how people were treated and forced to make decisions they shouldn't have to make.<br />It was disturbing to see a 79 year old man who is forced to work just so he can pay for medication for both himself and his wife.  Or the man who accidentally cut off two of his fingers and had to make a decision which finger to save because he couldn't afford both.  People shouldn't have to make those kinds of decisions.  Care "doesn't depend on your premiums, it depends on your needs," the film reports. You don't have to check your health security at the door, or mortgage your future when at your most sick and vulnerable.  I can only hope this movie wakes some people up, especially those flag waving people who keep on repeating slogans like "greatest country in the world" etc.  You can demand for universal health care, and you can vote for it.</p></br><a href="../users/A5X1B2HBQUR3P.html">A5X1B2HBQUR3P</a><br/><p>This Michael Moore film covers the below topics.<br /><br />(1) American Health care system critized to be a profitable enterprise setup by politicians for the benifit of politicians,Health insurance companies, doctors and pharmaceutical companies.

If nothing else this docuemntary makes us thing, so instead of starting to bash Michael Moore (CNN has bashed him enough, the big battle on TV with Sanjay Gupta), let's just sit and think for ourselves, try to research it out in our small way and then let's come to conclusions. You can't deny the fact that Michael has atleast triggered people to start thinking on this topic with as much attention and passion as is required. Because it is us who are affected by this issue. It concerns us and requires our research and thought.<br /><br />Also to be balanced it is to be said that to understand the implications of whether this socialised medicine will work in a country like USA (with the population of USA which is different from the smaller populations of European countries), how it will affect taxes ? , how good will the treatment be ? How much will be the waiting time ? Is a longer waiting time not justified if a larger number of people get the care ? Then again will the longer wait times mean someone not getting the quick aid he might get in the current system ? All these are not easy questions. These are questions which are better understood by economists, financial planners, doctors, philosophers etc because it is a complex environment with many variables. But we as a normal average joe person with whatever acumen is at our disposal have to take a stand one way or another.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></br><a href="../users/A3GRN6J64F2C3X.html">A3GRN6J64F2C3X</a><br/><p>Yes, I'm sure that Michael Moore, as a crafty entertainer as well as a documentarian, exaggerates for effect on occasion: I'm sure the socialized medicine systems of Great Britain, Canada and Cuba aren't the picture-perfect utopian ideals they may appear to be in "Sicko", and- yes- our own system isn't as horrible as it's made out to be, either.  But Mr. Moore has convinced me that there's a broad truth at work: other countries have moved beyond health care for profit and the United States should, too.  Any imperfections in a socialized medicine system are far less serious than the shortcomings of our own system, where providers routinely attempt to skimp on treatment because doing otherwise is bad for the bottom line.<br /><br />Interestingly, the movie mostly concentrates on people who DO have health insurance in this country, demonstrating that private, for-profit care often isn't much better than having no health insurance at all.  Then we see how much happier people seem to be in other countries where health care isn't an issue: if you get sick, you get the treatment you need.  Again, I'm sure there are foibles and inefficiencies in universal, public health care systems, too (anything run by humans won't be perfect, after all), but who can honestly argue that health care decisions should regularly be made with an eye toward the bottom line?<br /><br />"Sicko" delivers its credible message in a thoughtful, entertaining, and, unfortunately, often heartbreaking manner, and a plethora of special features on the DVD drive the film's points home further.  Don't miss this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>This political documentary is a manifesto against private medical care in the US and for universal free health care, what some have called socialized medicine. Michael Moore thus compares the US system based on the full exclusion of 50 millions Americans from health care and the partial exclusion of million more under the title of denial, the denial of one particular treatment to specific Americans by their own private insurance companies, a denial that can go as far as a full rejection of the client by the insurance company and the cancellation of their contracts and all benefits. To make his point he follows the cases of quite a few people in the US who suffered these "ailments" or "ills" of the US health system. Some people dying because of these denials, even infants, some people living in total discomfort, poverty, dependence even, because of the bills that ate up their homes, savings, and all other amenities they may have had before getting sick. Then he compares with the systems in four countries: Canada, Great Britain, France and Cuba. All of them have a globally free universal system where only some marginal costs are charged, at most. The  verdict is obvious. To emphasize the Cuban episode he compares with the care the prisoners in Guantanamo get (free top notch medical care) and the care some rescue workers at Ground Zero after the 9/11 attacks get in the US, and the care they managed to get, for free in Havana from Cuban doctors. The verdict once again does not stand the slightest possibility to appeal. This film though has a shortcoming. He notes the flat rate of a prescription in England (about ten dollars) but does not wonder why it exists. He speaks of a 100% free medical care in France and neglects some side charges. He is probably right with Canada and Great Britain, and definitely with Cuba, when speaking of a state system. But he is under a wrong impression as for France where the health system is not paid by the state but by contributions paid by working people on their salaries and this money is used to reimburse the medical expenses of people up to a certain point and managed by elected councilors representing the workers and employers equally and chosen by their electors on union lists from the trade unions or the employers' unions. The state only intervenes for the people who do not work through subsidies or contributions to the "social security authority" to compensate for the contributions these people do not pay. And what's more about 30% of medical expenses are covered by cooperative, or private, insurances that everyone is supposed, if so is their choice, to get and to whom they pay premiums that are at times higher than the basic contributions. It is a complex system. But Michael Moore does not explore the easy abuse these systems are the victims of from some people who are inconsiderate in overusing medical assistance or care. In England they introduced a flat payment per prescription to encourage economy on drugs. In France a small part of doctors' fees and prescriptions is not covered at all, even by the cooperative or private complementary insurance companies, by decision of the state in an attempt to curb down expenses and particularly abusive expenses. For instance in France brand name drugs that have an equivalent generic, and cheaper, version on the market are only reimbursed on the basis of this generic drug's price. But altogether Michael Moore's discourse is true and right, when we keep in mind that we have to think of the people who always try to get undue or abusive advantage of a generous system, and that we have to consider being economical with drugs and treatment because it is also a syndrome of our advanced stressful societies that many people, and at times those who are least stressed, look for some medical care when none is needed and they use a lot of time of doctors, nurses and other medical personnel for no reason at all except getting some attention. Finally let's keep in mind too that any system, private or public produces a bureaucracy and then a wasteful exploitation of an economic niche in society. This is an important shortcoming of the film: how much money is wasted by private insurance companies in the US to employ people, at times highly paid people, just to deny services to clients, and patients, and how much money is wasted on law suits by clients who are dissatisfied or on damages paid by the insurance companies when they lose these lawsuits? That would vastly account for the denial procedure that has to bring in a profit after paying for the expenses it incurs, money that could be used paying for hospital bills or doctors' fees.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines</p></br><a href="../users/A4PPZNQF1X2IY.html">A4PPZNQF1X2IY</a><br/><p>I was almost too lazy to watch this film, how pathetic I am.<br />M. Moore hit another HUGE homerun, this film hits you in the gut<br />from start to finish, weaves a devastating story, and is the first<br />and last thing you need to know about U.S. health care:  IT SUCKS !!<br />We're a bunch of suckers in the USA.  I shed a tear when the U.S.<br />rescue workers were embraced by their Cuban firefighting brothers.<br />Thank god someone can recognize a hero, apparently the U.S. government<br />cannot!  Next time you see a bright, shining skyscraper with a medical insurance, hmo, or drug company logo on the top, just remember all the dead and chronically ill people that were swindled, left to die or suffer untreated for the rest of their lives just so some top executives and CEOs can be filthy rich and the richest 1% can see their multi-million and billion dollar stock holdings appreciate.  We are all suckers in the U.S.  As the brillant british gentleman said, "If you can pay to kill people, certainly you can pay to save people".  That's all you need to remember.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>So Michael Moore saved the Moorewatch guy's wife's life and today that guy is still trashing him. And the guy's cyber buddy who also runs the site is telling Moore to "Go home and die."<br /><br />Real nice guys.<br /><br />I'm betting Moore knew the Republican response this movie would get. Socialized health care will destroy life on earth. But to everybody else, this film was a way we could all relate to each other because we know the pain that comes with the American system. We either don't have health care or we do but we never seem be covered for the procedure that we need at the time.<br /><br />This film calls for a change. The Republican system of throwing cash at corporations and hoping for the best is not working. It never has. It's time to do the American thing, the Christian thing, the human thing and make sure that every person in this country has access to health care at any point in their life and whenever they need it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MFNDNS1L7D16.html">A2MFNDNS1L7D16</a><br/><p>It's message of health care is very timely during this season of primaries. Many canidates spend a lot of time on it, rightfully so. You can't really swallow Mike Moore whole however. He plays the right notes to touch your emotions & indignation. Americans just like us who have inadequate health insurance, have been cheated or simply denied health care are highlighted in an informative & entertaining manner. HMO's, who have no intention of paying benefits, hire legions of people whose sole job is to deny benefits. They are the biggest demon in this documentary. He takes pains to poke a stick in the eye of the United States over things that most of us hate such as socialism (read communism) universal health care & the French. We really love to hate the French<br />mostly for no good reason. I'd really be jealous of the Canadians, English & French if what he presents is true, especially in France. They basically have nanny-care for everyone, cradle to grave courtesy of the the national government. My favorite is mandatory five weeks paid vacation for all workers. He treads very lightly on the massive tax load on citizens of these countries. But when your health bills are all paid for & your stress level goes down & it doesn't seem like such a bad trade off. Countries with universal health care generally have healthier life styles & live longer. We have a lot of socialist<br />tendencies right here when you think of it, public schools, a cheap postal system, Amtrak, food stamps etc. Univeral health coverage when seen through Mike Moore's lens seems to make sense.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MG8DHACXH5MS.html">A2MG8DHACXH5MS</a><br/><p>Michael Moore chronicles the American medical system in contrast with the public ones in Canada, UK, France, and other industrialized nations.

It is of course very revealing of a subject that would otherwise be unbroadcasted to us. CNN and MSN never reported of the criminal acts until Micheal Moore did. And it makes me so angry to hear of other countries who laugh at us, while we writh in our impossible mud hole of a health care system. It doesn't take this movie to tell people that our system is from hell, so what purpose does it serve other than to create a buzz? Well, I think it's important that people here know it's country wide, and that perhaps we could learn from some success stories elsewhere. As a movie, it's funny as hell, but it will put a tear in your eye as it's F***ing sad. We need to change our system. People need to ask themselves why the hell we put up with it? Are we so lazy and indifferent? Are we so scared? Well, Micheal has always been best at making people question their old belief's. My Republican boss says she will never give her money to Micheal, she even became angry when I brought it up. I can't believe this is a red and blue thing. Maybe, in that way, it's bad that Micheal directed this movie. He carries with him such political baggage. But there isn't anyone else and it's more important for this movie to be made.</p></br><a href="../users/ANGH6401L9Y0T.html">ANGH6401L9Y0T</a><br/><p>This was my first experience with Michael Moore's reporting/humor. But it's not my last: in the same order, I also got "Fahrenheit 9/11," "Bowling for Columbine," and "Roger & Me." He makes some vitally important points in this film, and blew away most of the arguments against government-paid health care that I have heard (and, I will admit, perpetuated) over my years as a Libertarian.<br /><br />Most of America agrees that food, clothing and shelter are necessities, and that if someone cannot provide them for themselves, it is simply humane and civilized that we pay for them with taxes. For most of us, the same is true of health care. Sure, we know there are abuses, but it's better to help one or two or even ten who might be able to help themselves, but are simply unwilling. Our alternative is to let those who really cannot meet these basic needs for themselves suffer needlessly. But that puts a huge gap between the poor who are acknowledged to need help and the middle-class who are expected to help themselves. So if it is all paid out of taxes, rich and poor and everyone in between, you don't need a big bureaucratic structure to decide who is unworthy and who is not.<br /><br />The really tragic stories are those who have health insurance, and so believe they are covered, and then get denied coverage by their insurance company for something they really do need. We are not talking vanity plastic surgery here, folks; we are talking basic health care needs.<br /><br />So Michael Moore, in his very boy-next-door style, shows us people in America who have had terrible problems due to the HMOs and insurance companies who find it in their interest to refuse treatment. And he shows us how different the situation is in Canada, England, and France. And finally, in Cuba.<br /><br />In a bold move that I couldn't help admiring, he noted that the prisoners of war on Guantanamo Bay have free health care, and better than what most of us have. So he loaded up several fishing boats with three ailing 9/11 rescue workers who could not get adequate care in the US, and a lot of other people who were not getting adequate care here, and took them to Guantanamo. Not too surprisingly, they were not permitted to land. So they went to Havana. And the Cuban doctors (those evil Communists) asked for name and date of birth, and provided them with the diagnostic tests and treatments they needed. One woman had terrible respiratory problems as a result of being at Ground Zero for some time breathing in ashes and whatever else. She had an inhaler which cost her something like $120 in the US. This is a huge sum when she needs one or two a month and she only gets $1,000 a month from SSDI. In Cuba, the same inhaler cost the equivalent of about $.05 -- yes, five cents. The Cuban doctors sent her home with a stockpile.<br /><br />We really do need to get behind HR 676. If the insurance companies and HMOs don't like that, there are plenty of other places for them to make their money. We will still need other types of insurance, and other types of financial services. It's not like they actually perform a real service for the money they make. They are essentially bookkeepers and record keepers, when they are not worse.<br /><br />And the pharmaceutical companies? They may not make as big a profit as they do now, but once the ones who require record returns on their investments have turned elsewhere, there will still be profits to be made at a reasonable level for those who survive. The ones that are currently making the generics can be re-tooled to make other drugs with little trouble.<br /><br />This movie is a must-see, especially now [2009] that Congress is working on a reform bill that is supposed to solve some of these problems -- and will undoubtedly fail to solve others.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HG2DOSBZEX4I.html">A1HG2DOSBZEX4I</a><br/><p>Whether you agree with him or not filmmaker Michael Moore's Sicko gives its viewers lots to think about concerning the state of healthcare in the United States today. Moore makes the argumentthat we would all be better off with a system of socialized medicine in place.<br /><br />It is clear that there are problems with the private insurance system which maximizes its profits by denying coverage to the sick in this country. Working from this premise Moore contrasts the systems in place in Canada, France, England and Cuba to show that universal coverage is the answer.<br /><br />Moore has taken a lot of heat over his investigative methods and his ways of presenting information. The question as to whether this is true journalism or pure muckraking and Bush bashing is best left up to the individual viewer but hos film is a good source of material for the health care debate and on this point alone it is well worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>3.5 stars<br /><br />Moore really hasn't evolved much at all as a filmmaker since Columbine, and Sicko feels like just another Moore film, with all that implies, perhaps a little lighter on the cheese. What makes this film worthwhile are the facts, and the many mirrors he holds up to American prejudices, especially against "socialism", which he reminds us is inherent in libraries, police, roads, and government of almost all stripes, services that we all take for granted as part of "capitalism".<br /><br />Still, Moore can grind on the nerves at times with his cutesy cuts and obvious music choices, and he gets cheesy at various junctures with both editing and close-ups. He's a manipulator, as usual, but then again that's part of making a documentary, so perhaps his main failing is that he can be sloppy at it. He can also be quite good too, though, and let's face it: he got folks watching docs again, and has pissed off the moronic Our-God-or-Die "conservatives" to no end, so he's doing his job as an active American citizen.<br /><br />Above all, most of the points made in Sicko are worth considering. Personally, I work out and eat well and avoid doctors at all costs. If more folks took health into their own hands instead of going to the doctor for a new pill every week, the health care system would work a lot better. But what sane man would ever expect his government to fulfill this most basic human responsibility for him?<br /><br />And let's do what Moore suggests and be totally honest: if Moore himself wasn't such a bloated foodhog he'd be a much more convincing spokesman for health care. How can a man who clearly places no value whatsoever on taking care of his own health tell us all to pay his doctor bills for him? Moore is a bright guy and has made some good films, but his own ill health is a walking billboard for why universal health care will be a big mess in any country where taking care of your own health makes less sense than waiting for the government to do it for you.<br /><br />In fact, I'm willing to bet Moore himself is more than aware of this irony. He's too smart not to be, but clearly not smart enough to exercise the discipline in his own life that he demands here from Washington, D.C. (a place not exactly known for discipline of any sort).<br /><br />Talking the talk means a lot less coming from one who ain't walking the walk.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>Michael Moore was a fine filmmaker before he became Michael Moore the Celebrity.  A few people may have forgotten that, in which case this film serves as a reminder.<br /><br />It's about people.  He starts with profiles of some folks in the US, then goes around the world, mostly staying in the background and letting the people and the facts speak for themselves.  It's just, as the title of this review might suggest, an excellent film.  That's all.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>If you have at least two marbles rolling around in your head, you can't watch SICKO and not realize the extreme lopsidedness of this well-filmed documentary. I should preface that comment with the fact that I've worked in the medical field for over two decades and know full-well that the insurance system in our country (the U.S.) is broken.<br /><br />Having enjoyed Michael Moore's previous documentaries (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00008DDVV">Bowling for Columbine</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JNEI">Fahrenheit 9/11</a>), there's always been a problem with his representation of only one side of the issues. Granted that "the other side" pushes back in different ways (governmental regulations, etc.), I feel Mr. Moore could improve his standing as an upright denizen of justice (as he know doubt sees himself) if he would pull in opposing views. Bowling and Fahrenheit did some of that, but not much. And here with Sicko, Mr. Moore doesn't do it at all.<br /><br />The biggest problem is that Mr. Moore shows the downtrodden in America, those on the lower income scale (mostly), or those without homes (the disoriented lady dropped off on a corner by a cab driver after being released from a hospital), but doesn't show this same economic class when comparing insurance related issues in socialized countries (Great Britain and France). In countries with socialized medicine, Mr. Moore focuses his lens on the middle or upper class, making it seem that this is the epitome of what the U.S. lacks. Socialized medicine is shown as the golden chalice, something that will fix our ailing medical and insurance industries. The fact is that socialized medicine probably IS what the U.S. needs, but we also need to see the downside to it. Taxes will be affected heavily, wait times for various tests will probably increase, and incomes for doctors and other healthcare professionals will be curtailed. The amazing thing to me is that I don't find any of these things off-putting. I'm willing to pay extra taxes, have increased patient loads for tests, and to have my salary dropped ...if everyone in our great nation could be covered.<br /><br />For all its flaws, Sicko is entertaining. And it makes anyone who watches it think about how messed up our healthcare systems are. Seeing Cuba's minimalist medical practices is fun to watch but Mr. Moore doesn't show their limited medical supplies. Watching him and his entourage go to GitMo to try and get free healthcare was laughable and a bit stupid, though (all he needed to do to prove that there is a socialized system already in the U.S. is to go to a federal prison ...but that wouldn't have been as dramatic).<br /><br />If Mr. Moore wants to increase his exposure and retain a semblance of authority on anything he films, he'll need to improve his standards as far as showing the issues from multiple viewpoints and multiple socio-economic households.</p></br><a href="../users/A16QODENBJVUI1.html">A16QODENBJVUI1</a><br/><p>Poll after poll in recent decades has shown healthcare (or to speak more precisely, the lack of affordable healthcare for all) to be the issue that more Americans feel strongly about than any other.  But special interest groups, i.e., the medical insurance providers and the American Medical Associations, as well as hundreds of fake grass roots groups that they have funded, have managed to undermine the good of the nation as a whole.<br /><br />This truly is a nonpartisan issue.  The film makes reference to the National Health Service in Great Britain, which is enormously popular with conservatives and liberals, doctors as well as patients.  One of the individuals Moore interviews mentions that Margaret Thatcher, a noted conservative, was a strong defender of the NHS.  He could also have mentioned that a key person guiding it through the legislative process was one of the most notable conservatives of the 20th century, Winston Churchill.  This is not a liberal-conservative issue, but a people issue.  Free, universal healthcare is an amazingly good thing for nations as wholes.<br /><br />Moore does a great job of highlighting the problems with a for-profit health system.  Despite the defenders of free market capitalism, there are several things it simply isn't any good at.  One of them is at providing universal programs for the commonweal.  In the United States for-profit healthcare has had the effect of empowering and benefiting financial services industries (insurance companies) at the expense of individuals.  As a result, Americans find healthcare, which already is not universally available, to be increasingly expensive and unaffordable.  And drug prices are spiraling out of control.<br /><br />As Moore shows in the film, almost all developed countries have better healthcare systems than the United States.  Most provide free and universal healthcare.  Many politicians, who accept huge campaign donations from various medical special interest groups, raise the specter of socialized medicine and spread myths about the unavailability of basic medical services.  Most of SICKO is devoted to taking on these "myths," or, to use a better word, "lies."  One of the most commonly told lies is that Canadians are trapped in a terrible health system in which they are often denied treatment for months.  Moore interviews a number of Canadians who clearly abhor the American health system and passionately embrace their own.  Moore asks one of these people whether he is a socialist, only to be told that he is a member of the Conservative Party.<br /><br />We are also often told (i.e., lied to) that things are terrible in Great Britain and France.  Once again, Moore visits both places and discovers that both the British and the French love their healthcare systems.  In all this I felt increasingly ashamed of the situation in the United States, not merely because of the expense and the lack of universality, but the approach.  We tend to treat conditions only after they have gotten bad, while the French and British emphasize preventative medicine.  In fact, one British doctor explained that he gets a bonus if he is able to get people to stop smoking.  In short, the healthcare systems in Canada, Great Britain, and France are exceedingly popular, while I rather hear anyone talk about how they love the American healthcare system.<br /><br />For the record, I work for a major insurer of hospitals and medical facilities.  I work inside the very industry that is causing a lot of the problems.<br /><br />Hopefully this film will help focus more concern on the need to gut and redo the American healthcare system.  Personally, I think the think to do is to make a revised Medicaid universal.  It should be revised to eliminate the Bush drug program for seniors (which is hated by the left, the right, and seniors) and put in place a real drug assistance program.  Why should the rest of the advanced countries have free, universal, and excellent healthcare while the United States suffer from inferior care?<br /><br />The only difficulty I had with the movie was the Cuba sequence.  Why?  Well, Moore had already made his point cogently and convincingly.  The trip to Cuba introduces a note of controversy that cloudies the water.  True, Cubans have free and excellent healthcare despite the poverty of the nation, but one thing that the film overlooks is that like in most countries there is considerable difference between the healthcare provided in the city and in the country.  Most of Cuba is rural and the healthcare there is not as good as what one finds in the city.  (Much the same is true in countries like China, where the quality of healthcare in the city is quite good while in the country is substandard.)  In other words, I thought the whole Cuba segment weakened the overall film.<br /><br />Hopefully Americans will get angry and do something about this.  Historically we don't wake up and change things until we let things go further than we should.  We tend to be a pretty compliant nation, willing to put up with a great deal before we get mad enough to do something about it.  Maybe the time is becoming ripe to get rid of the system we have and get something decent instead.</p></br><a href="../users/AN9J46667D80O.html">AN9J46667D80O</a><br/><p>Sure, like all of Michael Moore's films this movie is more editorial than documentry. It's trying to make a very specific point (the American health care system is seriously broken), and pulls out all the stops to do so. It does so with all the usual wit and humor of Michael Moore, which to my mind is a good thing.<br /><br />The movie focuses on various middle-class people who generally thought they had decent medical coverage. They usually thought this right up to the point where they needed it and then... pft. They find out they aren't covered for things, or that stuff they weren't aware they had are listed as pre-existing conditions. They aren't eligable for certain treatments. They have large co-pays and deductables. They can't see the doctors they want to do. The doctors can't give them the treatment they want to give them because the patients can't afford it, etc, etc, etc.<br /><br />Part of the problem with the American health care system, and something that's made plain in the movie, is that it's being run by for-profit insurance companies that have a vested interest in making sure they pay for as little as they possibly can. They want to maximize profits, after all, and I can't blame them for that.<br /><br />There are flaws in the movie. The health care systems in France, Canada and England are painted with too-rosy pictures and nothing showing their flaws. Cuba's health care is presented as magnificent while their human rights issues are glossed-over or ignored (though one can make the point that this movie isn't focusing on human rights, just health care). Some of the problems that do exist with socalized medicine are not addressed.<br /><br />That said, when I think of this problem, I think about my sister and her family. She has a husband and they have four kids. She works and he works. If, god forbid, one of their children got, say, leukemia, then likely one of them would have to quit their job to take care of the kid. Probably the one with the crappier health coverage. That means their income decreases dramatically. Stress goes up. Resentment towards the child due to the incredibly high medical costs can't help but form, irrational though that would be. The parents fight over money. Next thing you know, the $[...] medical bills have sent the family into bankruptcy. They lose their home and have to move into a small apartment. But, hey, in the end, since we do have the best medical care money can buy, at least the daughter is ok.<br /><br />Until the relapse. Or until the working parent gets injured. Or until one of the other kids gets sick. Etc. All those things are horrible enough, but the is the only "real" country where you have to choose between money and medicine and that's just bad. How does our contry benefit from people being made bankrupt by medical bills?<br /><br />The DVD release contains about 80 minutes of footage not seen in the theatrical version. Of note particularly is the segment on Norway. You know, I can't help but think that perhaps if we had minimum security prisons like the ones they show in the movie, instead of the crappy minimum security ones we have here, our crime right might nose down a bit. There could be something to this whole "treat people like people" thing, and focusing on rehabilitation rather than punishment.<br /><br />But I digress.<br /><br />The message I come away with from this movie is the following: socialized medicine/universal health care is not perfect. Far from it. But it is better than what we have now, and there's no reason we can't do it better than the other countries that have it do. After all, not too horribly long ago we fought the Germans, Italians and the Japanese all at basically the same time. We've gone to the Moon. We have TiVo. Any country that can do all these things can and should have a better health care system than what we have now.<br /><br />See this movie. Even if you don't like Michael Moore, see it (he's not on screen much anyhow). See it, and then do something about it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D8CUJPOSRPNA.html">A2D8CUJPOSRPNA</a><br/><p>Leave it to cinematic muckraker and agent provocateur Michael Moore to stir up the pot again.  For the third time in less than five years, this renegade has made it his business to take on the powers-that-be on celluloid.  In 2002, it was the gun lobby with BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE; in 2004, it was the Bush cabal in FAHRENHEIT 9/11.  And now with SICKO, he takes on the issue of health insurance, or lack thereof, in America.<br /><br />As Moore himself says at the outset, SICKO isn't necessarily about the fifty million Americans who have no health insurance to begin with.  It is about all the rest of us who do, and who are of the belief that our health insurance carriers will cover the cost of needed drugs or operations, come what may.  But the awful truth about health insurers in particular, and the health care system in general, is that they can deny a claim for any asinine reason to maximize profits.  In essence, this means that every single one of us might be just one illness or one rejected claim away either from financial destitution or, at the very worst, Death itself.  And as always, Moore sardonically goes up against the HMO/pharmaceutical bureaucracy that not only allows this to happen, but also has every elected official in Washington in their pocket so as to make doubly sure that universal health care never becomes a reality in America--brainwashing them, and the American people at large, into thinking of such a system as "socialized medicine", one step removed from a Commie-like bureaucracy.<br /><br />But piece by piece, Moore shows us the inherent fallacy of such a notion.  First, he shows us a couple of dozen ordinary Americans hit hard by HMOs who will not approve for needed treatment or operations, thus resulting either in bankruptcy or death.  Then he shows how "socialized medicine" works in Canada, England, and France--quite well, thank you very much: high rates of healthy people; low infant mortality; people who live quite well off; and doctors who don't have to worry about an HMO approving or turning down potentially life-saving treatment, they just DO IT.  What does that say about America, which ranked at #37 on the World Health Organization's list of best health care in the world--just barely ahead of provincial Slovenia?!<br /><br />Then, to add insult to injury (no pun intended), Moore takes several emergency workers who were at Ground Zero on 9/11 to receive treatment outside the U.S., after these workers were told that the treatment they needed either couldn't be done or wouldn't be paid for by the powers-that-be.  And where do they all go?  Cuba--a nation we've had an embargo against since October 1962; a nation whose ruler generations of Americans have learned to despise with every fiber of their being!  And what kind of treatment do these 9/11 heroes get?  The best!  How can one NOT be outraged by the fact that one of the last remaining bastions of the Red Menace can give Americans better health care than their own government?!<br /><br />SICKO, like almost everything Moore has ever done, be it movies or books, has been attacked by the HMO/pharmaceutical complex, whose lobbying power in Washington is exceeded only by the dreaded military/industrial complex.  If it had been only one or two HMO horror stories that made the news in the last twenty years, they might have had a legitimate beef.  But Moore has given us dozens here; and we know of thousands of others--and this includes hospitals dumping indigent patients on L.A.'s Skid Row.  This state of affairs should not be happening here in America, but it is, thanks to the HMOs and the pharmaceutical giants.<br /><br />Yes, what Michael Moore advocates--a universal health care system, presumably funded out of a percentage of our taxes--would mean the collapse of the medical bureaucracy.  But unless we have such a system in place that puts decisions of life and death in the hands of doctors and not political lackeys, being the richest country in the world as we are is going to be negated by us having the worst human rights record in the world.  Health care cannot and should not be a privilege.  As SICKO and its creator so eloquently state, it should be a human RIGHT!</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>All I can say is WOW.  I knew America's health care system was screwed up, but I had no idea it was actually THIS bad, especially compared to the rest of the countries around the world.  I was aware people were driving across America's borders to get access to Canada's better system, and I was even aware the good people of England had a government that was more willing to lend a helping hand to the people than the American one.  I also knew the relationship between America and France was never that great (though personally, I love the French and the people there even though I have no relation to the country).<br /><br />This "documentary" (or whatever you want to call it) did a really amazing job showing us, from many different views and sources, that America doesn't do enough to care about the peoples medical problems.  That's the main point of the movie, and I think you'll find yourself paying attention to everything the film has to offer.  In fact, I KNOW you well, because the film tells the problems and stories of each person (or family) so WELL that you can't help but keep watching it to find out what happens.<br /><br />The greatest part was the ending where a certain unique set of people got on a boat and travelled across the ocean to... I won't reveal this part, so you have something to completely shock you.  Just a great great job this film showed all of us</p></br><a href="../users/A1OBPHRXHZF8P6.html">A1OBPHRXHZF8P6</a><br/><p>As one of the masses of Americans without quality healthcare insurance, watching this film really struck a cord. Despite being a progressive, something about Moore hadn't previously really shaken me--until now.<br /><br />The depths which people go to merely to take care of ourselves would be amusing in an action adventure movie. But this is basic sustenance in what is supposed to be an affluent first world democracy. Scavenging for our sustenance is time-consuming. This concept also degrades the very notion that America is prosperous and the present model of healthcare successfully works.<br /><br />With emphasis currently being spent on rewarding the industry fat cats rather than practicing preventative medicine, American health care is poorly managed when compated against other western democracies. The individual testimonies throughout this film are heartbreaking  And they would not have had to make these journies in a universal health care system.</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>i always applaud Michael Moore for going where so few other directors dare venture to. this Documentary focuses on the Subject of Health care and how the United States is Selective about sharing it whereas europe and other parts of the world are fair and reward there doctors,etc... on the subject matter and welcome all patients and everything is balanced. i enjoyed the depths and lengths that Moore went to. I dug the 9/11 tie in and the fireman being acknowledged. so many powerful moments in this film which were needed. a Good film and a must see.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AOKQCH0YBZDS.html">A3AOKQCH0YBZDS</a><br/><p>Michael Moore once again gives us another documentary that is very thought provoking. This time Moore's attention has turned to the US Health Care System.... "Sicko" doesn't focus on the 50 million Americans without health insurance, but the 250 million Americans whom are insured. Plus, "Sicko" also focuses on how the US health care system rates with other countries, like Canada, France, England & Cuba.<br /><br />I was really shocked at what I learned about health insurance companies here in the US after watching "Sicko"... and was surprised to learn about how well universal health care systems work so great for those that live in countries with this type of health care system. It appears that a universal health care system is the way to go after watching "Sicko". It begs the question: "If universal health care is working so great in other countries, then why aren't we implementing here in the US?".<br /><br />Not knowing the full scoop/impact of how universal health care really works/effects nations that use this type of health care system, it is truly difficult to say whether our health care system or universal health care is really the way to go. "Sicko" makes a great case for the use of a universal health care system, but is there more than meets the eye?</p></br><a href="../users/A3MV1KKHX51FYT.html">A3MV1KKHX51FYT</a><br/><p>Sicko, 2007 film<br /><br />The movie begins with a man sewing up a cut on his leg. Another man cut off two finger tips on a table saw. Fifty million Americans have no health insurance. We meet a married couple who have health insurance, but heart attacks and cancer cost them their home. A 79-year old man works for his medicine. In 2006 Michael Moore began collecting horror stories about health care. You can't get health insurance if you have many, many diseases (such as a heart problem or diabetes). What if you have health insurance? You can still have a problem. Denial letters are rubber-stamped to keep a denial rate that is measured. Insurance companies look for ways to deny coverage to their customers. Physicians are rewarded for denying care, even if it results in a patient's death.<br /><br />Nixon speaks about health care; there was a trick here. Clinton tried to create Universal Health Care, but was defeated. Health Insurance companies have more lobbyists than there are Congressmen. Drug companies also buy Congressmen to get laws passed. George W. Bush raised costs for Medicare patients. The film explains the advantages of the Canadian Health System. Canadians must buy health insurance when they travel to America! "Even for a day." Those who need help get it right away in Canada. Canadians live three years longer on average. There is a flat charge for prescription drugs in Britain. No fee for medical services. We see how the "Cashier" office works in Britain. You get carfare. Democracy brought National Health Services to Great Britain in 1948, just after World War II. People in Britain are healthier than in America. [Is this part of political oppression in America? To keep people demoralized?] There is a horror story where a child was refused treatment and then died.<br /><br />We hear about medical care in France and its system. Doctors make house calls. Five weeks of paid vacation there. They explain the reason why: the government is afraid of the people, not the other way around. Moore interviews a family about their life in France. [No mention of taxes. Moore needs to push himself away from "Freedom Fries".] Back in Los Angeles we see how patients are dumped by the County Hospital when they can't pay their bills. In some places in America people help each other when in need (an old tradition). Volunteers who helped on 9/11 were denied health benefits. Insurance companies did this because the system works that way. Do the prisoners at Guantanamo get better treatment that people in America? [Moore is very clever in his examples.] Free universal health care in Cuba has the benefits of lower infant mortality and greater life expectancy (the two are linked).<br /><br />Documentaries lie on the continuum between fact and fiction. Authenticated events are often recreated for the camera. I think this movie would be better if it concentrated on Canada instead of foreign countries with different languages and cultures. Before 1945 America was the exemplar for personal liberty, but that has changed. Now many European countries are more advanced in personal rights because of their politics. The lack of universal health care correlates to political oppression (low wages and high taxes) since the end of World War II.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>The most surprising thing about Michael Moore's "Sicko" is that it holds so few surprises. HMO chiefs raking in billions in profits? Insurance companies finding any loophole or lame reason to deny coverage? US politicians deep in the pocket of Big Pharma? It is so depressingly familiar and so well-known to anyone paying the least bit of attention to what is going on in this country.<br /><br />Moore does something that the endless stream of talking heads on TV never manages to do, and that is to show the anguish of real human beings who are daily fed into the meat grinder of the American health care system. From sick parents forced to foreclose and move back with their kids, to 79-year-olds working in menial jobs to keep their health care, to young, sick moms having to lie to get their meds across the border in Canada, Moore show us the faces and tells us the stories of Americans who have been thrown under the bus by a system bent on profit, profit and more profit.<br /><br />What might have been a ridiculous "Moore-ish" stunt - bringing 9/11 heroes to Guantanamo Bay to gain the same rights as terror suspects -- actually broke in Moore's favor. Moore managed to get his charges into the Cuban health care system, where (get this!) they were cared BASED ON THEIR NEED, NOT ON THEIR ABILITY TO PAY! One woman who pays hundreds of dollars for inhalers in the US was sold one for 5 cents. This poor woman, much of whose income goes to treating the airway injury she received digging victims out of the Pile, burst into tears at the indignity of having been screwed so thoroughly by the health care system of the nation for which she had sacrificed so much.<br /><br />"Sicko" also takes us to Paris and to London, where Moore explodes the myths that socialized health care is so terrible. When citizens of these nations get sick, if a government-funded doctor does not come to their door, they go to the hospital where they are promptly cared for, and at no charge. That's right, not grilled to make sure they can pay and not plied with high-priced designer drugs. It's no wonder that our politicians (and many of their witless, gulled constituents who happily vote against their own self-interest) mock the French so mercilessly. Clearly, if the average American knew the fleecing they were getting, and the way they are doing nothing but enriching the super-rich, they would revolt.<br /><br />"Sicko" should be a jolt for everyone who reflexively assumes that America is best at everything. Clearly, the nation that consistently places profits before people, then convinces them that this larcenous state of affairs is a better deal, a sign of patriotism and proof of advanced morals has a lot to answer for.<br /><br />Bravo, Michael Moore, for sticking your finger in the eye of the Man once again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGVB3T5QJNRE.html">A3DGVB3T5QJNRE</a><br/><p>Sicko is a masterpiece! It left me feeling like I was living in the wrong country. The United States, the "Greatest Country In The World?" Hogwash! More like, "the best brainwashed" people in the world!"<br /><br />Other countries have their priorities straight, that is Canada, France, and even demonized "Third-World" Cuba! In the United States, where we pride ourselves for our "freedom" and "fair play," we tolerate a Heath Care system which gives hard-working, medically-insured, middle class people the freedom to die, in order to maximize corporate profits! And, God help you if you don't have Health Insurance in the United States - it's "fair play" to literally dump you in the front of a homeless shelter in a hospital gown while you're disoriented. I mean, you can't afford treatment so let the Catholic Church, or some other third party, play doctor at an emergency shelter!<br /><br />While we have been brainwashed about the evils of Fidel Castro's Cuba, the vast majority  of the residents of  present day "Communist" China would be slobbering all over themselves to have  such advanced and universal medical care as Cuba does. For Pete's sake, it took China many years just to get HIV out of their domestic blood supply! But yet, no one in authority, dares demonize "Red" China. Why? Because our two governments are in bed with each other to such a degree neither really cares what the other does to its own people! But Cuba, which is exporting medical breakthroughs, like vaccines, to the entire world, is Public Enemy # 1! Why? Because they won't obey our "American" rules with regards to screwing their own people out of benefits such as Universal Health care!<br /><br />I don't for a second think any country is perfect, whether it be Canada, France, Cuba or any other nation, for that matter. But, when a country that is so incredibly wealthy, powerful and technologically advanced, as the United States, lets numerous people suffer and/or die solely to maximize corporate profits, then it's time for marching in the streets! Maybe we all should be taking lessons from the French! They know how to bring their government to its knees in order to benefit the many over the few!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0199204780">Brainwashing: The Science of Thought Control</a>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HYXSDU">Handbook For Nonviolent Action</a>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0520082982">Healing the Masses: Cuban Health Politics at Home and Abroad</a>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FI953A">On revolutionary medicine.(speech by revolutionary Che Guevara to Cuban Militia)(socialized medicine in Cuba)(Speech) : An article from: Monthly Review</a></p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>Love him or hate him, Michael Moore knows how to open dialogues and make us think. Out of all his documentaries, "Sicko" is probably his most thought provoking. This can be said from both a liberal and conservative perspective; whatever your political beliefs are, whatever your moral standards, I think everyone in America should be required to see this film. A bold thing to say, I know, but I really do feel that way. Not only does it bring a number of health care-related issues to the surface, it also sheds light on how health care operates in other countries. Canada, the United Kingdom, and France, for example, all rely on a universal system, in which medical services are fully subsidized by the government. In today's day and age, when for-profit American health care shows every sign of collapsing under its own weight, understanding how other western countries look after their sick and injured is very important.<br /><br />When word spread about Moore's new documentary, a number of major pharmaceutical companies ordered their employees to completely avoid him should an interview be requested. For all intents and purposes, Moore managed to get someone's attention. Such is the way with "Sicko," a film that can effectively get anyone's attention with its mixture of figures, humor, and heartbreak. Can such tactics be considered manipulative? Yes, they can. But so can news reports and magazine articles and newspaper headlines, all of which we rely on for information. Maybe this is subject matter that requires manipulation, if only for the sake of forcing us out of our comfort zones. As I see it, many problems that have been pushed aside finally need to be addressed.<br /><br />The film's origins date back to early 2006, during which Moore made an on-line reqeust for health care horror stories. He received thousands of e-mails within a week. Some of the more dramatic stories are highlighted at the beginning of the film, such as a man who accidentally sawed off the tips of his left middle and ring fingers. Because he did not have health insurance, he was given two options: have the middle tip reattached for $60,000, or the ring tip for $12,000. The fact that he chose the ring tip isn't the point. For that matter, neither is the fact that he wasn't insured; Moore makes it clear that this film is really about insured Americans who feel that their plans have failed them. Consider a couple forced to move into their daughter's home after a paying a series of medical bills; the husband suffered three heart attacks and the wife was diagnosed with cancer.<br /><br />With that and other such devastating examples, Moore examines the history of American health care and it's eventual effects. I distinctly remember footage from a 1996 congressional testimony given by guilt stricken Dr. Linda Peeno, formerly a medical reviewer for the health insurer Humana. Nearing tears, she admitted that her job was to save money for the company, not to treat the sick or injured. She then recalls denying medical care for a man in 1987, resulting in his death. Moore also examines connections between lobby groups and political groups. Back in the 1950s, the idea of universal health care was considered Socialist, and therefore un-American. Years later, Hillary Clinton proposed a plan for national health care. It might have happened had she not sold out and accepted campaign money from the pharmaceutical industry.<br /><br />The more compelling examples of patient mistreatment are presented near the end of the film. Moore interviews three September 11, 2001 volunteers who have since developed medical problems due to Ground Zero's extreme conditions. The government will not provide them with any medical care; they're not firefighters, and therefore, they're not government employees. The prisoners held on Guantanamo Bay, on the other hand, have complete medical coverage. In response to this, Moore escorts the volunteers to Guantanamo Bay via boat, stating that America's heroes should be given the same medical treatment as America's enemies.<br /><br />But out of all the stories presented, this one is by far the most interesting. Jim Kenefick, designer of an anti-Michael Moore website, was suddenly faced with the possibility of shutting his website down. His wife had become ill, and the cost of her medical bills exceeded the amount he spent on web development. In desperation, he pleaded for help by posting an on-line request for money ("In Need of a Christmas Miracle!" was its title). Moore anonymously sent him a check for $12,000 in what was surely one of the most selfless acts of generosity ever. The medical bills were paid. The website continues to run. I think Mr. Kenefick owes it to himself to see "Sicko"; his First Amendment right to bash Moore is openly defended.<br /><br />Considering everything I've said, I feel it necessary to explain a few things. My intention in writing this review is not to change anyone's mind about American health care, and while I personally agree with Michael Moore's position, I'm not asking anyone to do the same. I want people to see "Sicko" only because it reintroduces an important issue, and important issues should always be discussed.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>****1/2<br /><br />Once again, filmmaker Michael Moore courts controversy and hits one out of the ballpark with "Sicko," his stinging and often heartbreaking indictment of the largely dysfunctional American health care system.<br /><br />In his new film, Moore has toned down much of the inflammatory rhetoric and personal diatribes that defined his earlier work - although he is certainly not averse to employing the occasional bit of theatrical grandstanding or the intermittent cheap shot if it helps to more effectively get his message across.  And the message here is that the medical system in the United States is seriously ill, if not, indeed, on life support itself.  As usual, Moore personalizes the issue for the audience by focusing on a few specific people who have fallen victim to the bureaucratic nightmare that is the American system of managed care.  Through an accumulation of largely anecdotal evidence, he shows how working-class people are often driven to near-bankruptcy by the enormity of their medical bills or, even worse, how they often get sicker or even die either because they have no insurance at all or because the insurance companies refuse to cover the operations or medications the patients need to get better.  Moore is always at his most convincing - and his least polemical - when dealing with these individual cases.<br /><br />Having completed his "diagnosis,"  Moore next moves onto the "cure," which he sees as a universal health care program run by the government.  This, of course, is where he gets most into trouble with those on the Right and the powers-that-be (i.e. the insurance companies and corporate CEO`s) who have the most to lose from any kind of system reformation.  To prove the superiority of "socialized medicine," he takes his film crew to Canada, Britain and France to check out the medical systems there.  Not surprisingly, he encounters only the most glowing reports from doctors, patients and the average man-on-the-street concerning the quality of the medical treatment in those countries.  Finally, in his most blatant example of political theater, he rounds up several 9/11 rescue workers, all of whom have developed serious illnesses as a result of their time spent at ground zero, and takes them to Cuba to receive the medical treatment these modern American heroes have been denied in their own country.  Moore's in-your-face style may not make for the most impartial examination of the issue, but it does make for one heck of a compelling human drama.<br /><br />Moore is not a "documentarian" in the egalitarian sense we have grown accustomed to from television.  He doesn't study both sides of an issue, and he feels no compunction to provide a reasoned, carefully balanced debate that allows differing opinions to be expressed.  Instead, he is a man hellbent on a mission, an individual deeply concerned with righting the wrongs that he sees in his society.  He also just happens to be an artist with enough filmmaking skill and talent to be able to convey his passions in a clear and largely convincing way to a mass audience.  "Sicko" is a much less "playful" movie than either "Bowling for Columbine" or "Fahrenheit 9/11."  Moore doesn't indulge in as many self-aggrandizing stunts or parlor tricks as he did in those other films, and he is more willing to move off into the background to allow the people in the movie to speak for themselves.  The tradeoff for this approach is that there is also a lot less humor.<br /><br />All throughout the movie, Moore is constantly appealing to our better angels. How, he wonders, can a people as great and generous as Americans tend to be, allow their fellow citizens to go on suffering when the remedy seems so clearly in their grasp.  Whether universal health care would be just another panacea, or whether it might actually turn out to be the cure for what ails us, only time will tell.  But Moore's point is that the time has long since passed for us to do something serious and concrete to address this problem.  "Sicko" may, indeed, be "propaganda," but, if it is, it is propaganda in the service of a salutary purpose.  And, after all, Moore`s is hardly the only voice out there debating this issue, for there are powerful and well-financed forces lined up on the other side.  He may, at this point, be just one little David facing down the Philistines with their corporate lobbyists and special interest money; but Moore has faith that a citizenry, armed with righteousness and passion, can slay a whole army of insurance company Goliaths - if they just put their collective minds to it.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>This is Michael Moore's least entertaining documentary, but it is maybe his most important one so far. Anyone who has spent time with Moore's documentaries and heard the critics will realize in Sicko than the detractors have been semi-right all along, because when it comes to propaganda, Sicko maybe his most half-truths laden work to date... but he does do it well.<br /><br />With this ambulance it is impossible for the neigh Sayers to claim that Moore is balanced or impartial. Moore can take a topic like America's failing healthcare system and then push it so that Cuba is helping 911 rescue workers get medical care. Of course it is all mountains of misinformation built on hills of truth and we know that Cubans aren't getting what those 911 rescue workers got, so why do we watch him? Moore raises questions and does it in a way that makes his points interesting. If the same points were made in any other way it would scarcely raise an eyebrow, but Moore is capable of making something important that gets under our skin. He makes us think, and makes good arguments, even if it does mean we have to bare the hyper velocity spin, and does it go around and around at times.<br /><br />Sicko does make an important case. Capitalism at its most selfish kills. This is undeniable. The problem is has Moore sold America on a socialized healthcare system? The truth is that he does make a good case for it and seems to indicate that politicians took some nice pay checks not to endorse it. Sicko is absolutely fascinating stuff but Moore does test our gullibility.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FG91CM8221X1.html">A1FG91CM8221X1</a><br/><p>When we go to a Michael Moore film, we know we aren't going to get reasoned analysis, so there's no sense in complaining about its absence. What we get is impassioned, left-leaning advocacy on behalf of people victimized by the huge, voracious, profit-driven gaps in "the American system." In his best films, such as "Bowling for Columbine" or "Fahrenheit 9/11," Moore can get away with one-sided advocacy because the cold, hard, balanced facts support only his side. The first half of "Sicko" is some of the most compelling filmmaking Moore has ever done, because it details case after heartrending case of flagrant, murderous injustice committed against ordinary American citizens by the hideous bureaucracy of the American health care system. We hear of the little girl who died because Kaiser Permanente didn't authorize care at the hospital where her mother took her; of the desperately ill, disoriented people literally dumped at homeless shelters, still in their hospital gowns, because their insurance ran out; of the 9/11 rescue workers who can't get health care after sacrificing their health in the effort to save their countrymen's lives. We see former insurance company workers break down weeping because they were forced to turn down claims they knew were valid, all in the name of maximizing profits. As one of them says, "These people didn't fall through the cracks. They were swept toward the cracks and forced down them." This is advocacy journalism at its best. Moore, unfortunately, is far less effective in the film's second half, when he extols--strictly on anecdotal evidence--the vast superiority of the British, French, Canadian and Cuban health care systems. While there's no question these systems have saved millions of people from going bankrupt over health care costs, Moore loses a lot of points by not pointing out the problems with these systems. Britain's system, for example, is a two-tiered system in which those who can afford it can go straight to Harley Street and bypass the waiting line at the National Health Service (which, despite Moore's claims otherwise, can be lethally long). And also, after pointing out that the U.S. ranks #37 in the world in health care and extolling the marvelous health care system of Cuba, he fails to note that the list he himself presents shows Cuba at #39. Moore's final stunt, taking a group of sick people first to Guantanamo, then to Havana, for health care feels cheesy and staged in the extreme. Moore has been accused in the past of taking advantage of his interview subjects, but here it's blatant; Moore is using these frightened, desperately ill people to make a Big Point Against the System. He caps the movie with an act of charity that I will not reveal, but which I think most people will agree is less an act of charity than of self-aggrandizing revenge. He'll get no points in Heaven for it, I can assure you. The insane, crippling costs of health care in this country, and the Byzantine, callous health insurance bureaucracy, are national scandals that must be reformed, and Moore brings its injustices home to us with justified outrage. But if there's one area in public debate that screams for thought and reason, it's health care. That Michael Moore couldn't be expected to give us that doesn't mean that he didn't have to.</p></br><a href="../users/A10HMPPHWI3V0A.html">A10HMPPHWI3V0A</a><br/><p>I personally would not call myself a HUGE Michael Moore fan, - which is rare seeing that people seem to either completely despise the man OR totally idolize him. I am not biased what so ever ... and I believe that his previous films tended to try to bash you over the head with the same topics over and over again until you found yourself walking out of the theater with a bit of a headache. Don't get me wrong though, - at times - they can prove to be thought provoking Documentaries with just the right touch of satire.<br /><br />In my eyes Mr. Moore is alot like Rolling Stone magazine - the way that he is SO liberal and SO against the direction the Country is headed.

The film is reasonably entertaining but for a non-American audience not particularly revelatory.<br /><br />Reform of the American health system is incredibly difficult because of the influence of health lobbyists on legislators - and like gun control there is a lot of hand-wringing but little change.<br /><br />Sadly Moore does not make any effort to hear the "other" side of the story, which could have made this documentary much more interesting.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TMAVN4CEM8U8.html">A1TMAVN4CEM8U8</a><br/><p>Sicko  DVD<br /><br />Sicko is Michael Moore's rant against the health care system in the United States, yeah, like he's qualified to say anthing.

Or a GED?<br />Soime interesting facts, not opinions:<br /><br />The USA invented over half of the pharmaceuticals in use by the World today.<br /><br />Cuba does have Universal Health Care, universally bad,  look at the flies in the pitiful bathrooms that Moore does not show  you.<br /><br />England has universal health care, and a three day waiting period to get a tattoo.  Why?  Because getting a tattoo removed is a health care procedure.<br /><br />There is an often quoted figure of 47 million American don't have health insurance.  You know why?  A number of them are eligible for Title XIX ( Medicaid) but have not applied, yet.  Another group are illegal aliens from Central America.  They didn't say citizens of the United States, they said "Americans", which illegal aliens from Central and South America are, technically.<br />Remember "It depends on the what the meaning of "is" is?<br /><br />Not recommended for thinking adults and for those who don't want Michael Moore to make more millions.<br /><br />Gunner  June 2008</p></br><a href="../users/A1TWTULVD6F22O.html">A1TWTULVD6F22O</a><br/><p>This is less about pointing fingers than it is about working together to resolve this situation in America today.  By sticking (for the most part) to that premise, and not blaming one party or the other, Moore comes up with a film that everyone should see.<br /><br />It is time for Americans to demand a change in our healthcare system. No, not by saying it is important to us, not by writing it on the internet. It takes more of a revolution than that. We are all going to have to demonstrate, visibly, whatever it takes, that we will only elect a President and legislators that have a concrete plan to provide a system of healthcare in this country that is similar to the rest of the western world. And that means that doctors will need to go to work for the healthcare system, and medical insurance companies will need to close their doors and distribute their shareholders' equity to the shareholders. Perhaps they can pony some of it up to a National Healthcare Fund before they go.<br /><br />I don't pretend to understand all the economic ramifications, the project of transforming the system from private to public. That's what I elect all those people to figure out. A better day is coming. It has to.<br /><br />In Michael Moore's past films,he spent too much time on himself and his sarcasm in the films, substituting his political beliefs sometimes for his judgement as a filmmaker. Thus, he was destined to polarize a lot of potential viewers.<br /><br />I saw "Sicko" today, Moore's film about healthcare in America. As for pointing a political finger,  he chose not to blame one political party or another ... oh, there are a couple of Bush jokes and one poke at Hillary, but for the most part, what Moore was trying to express was, with our deep-seated fear of socialism, we have allowed a corrupt and ineffective system of healthcare and health insurance to permeate (and in many families' cases, nearly destroy) our country's way of life.<br /><br />The plight of many who have suffered in the American healthcare system is staggering, and sad. Moore tells his story through a series of vignettes, and chooses NOT to discuss the most obvious issue - those who have NO healthcare insurance. Instead, he focuses on the issues faced by those who DO, or who can apply. Most of the issues, portrayed in the first half of the film deal with those who cannot get a policy because of pre-existing conditions (e.g., those who are the sickest, those who have the most debilitating diseases, who need healthcare the most) and cannot get covered. I'm lucky. My employer takes all employees and their dependents into the policy at 90 days, with or without pre-existing conditions. Most do not.<br /><br />Then there is the matter of what is covered, and what is not covered. Moore shows the plight of a 50 something couple (he's had three heart surgeries, she's a cancer survivor). They've been bankrupted just by co-pays and deductibles and are forced to live in a small room with their daughter. He shows the fate of a man who is the spouse of a healthcare worker at a large Midwestern hospital....his brother has been diagnosed as a perfect candidate to donate bone marrow to prevent his death from kidney cancer, but the hospitalization policy won't pay for the surgery. You can guess what happens to the man with cancer. Throughout this series, he points out the issues with the big insurance companies (also including some very difficult to deal with situations where their employees who have to deny care try to cope with the blame they lay on themselves), the big pharmaceutical companies, the employers who are trying to cut costs and specify the terms of the plans, the legislature, the past attempts by executives to do something about it, and the general malaise in government about the situation. This is strong stuff. It is nothing we don't know, but to see it assembled here, in essay format, is to feel some of the shame and sense of hopelessness we have all faced when friends, relatives or we, ourselves, struggle with healthcare and its costs. To wonder where America took the wrong turn, the wrong fork in the road.<br /><br />Moore moves into the danger of socialized medicine by showing some of the rhetoric we have been subjected to in the US about how bad the system is. He points out that our healthcare system is ranked 37th in the world, just above Slovenia's. He lets us visit the healthcare system in Canada, Britain and France, to make the contrast between their government systems and our startlingly inept private system. The biggest laugh in the film is found here, when we learn why the British hospital has a cashier's desk. (No spoiler, go see it!)It is at this point that the realization hits home. In contrast to those in friendly democratic and quasi-friendly, quasi-socialist western companies..... well, we suck at this.<br />And that, my friends, is the message. Through our shame and our ineptitude, we have allowed the most important elements of our society, our people, to suffer. We have used our tax dollars unwisely, we have had the wrong social priorities, and we must change it. NOW.<br /><br />Moore's film is not without its stunt. And even if you recognize it for the stunt it is, even if you know that what you see on camera was somewhat staged, you can't help but break down. This is the controversial scene where Moore learns that we have universal healthcare for the inmates at Guantanamo, so he takes some EMT volunteers from the 911 cleanup effort, who have become very sick, and a few others from the film, by boat, to Guantanamo. They can't get it to get free healthcare. So, he takes them to a free clinic/hospital in Cuba, and everyone receives some of the help they needed that they couldn't get in America.  And a tribute is made by Cuban firefighters to some of these unsung heroes of 911.<br /><br />The film is grainy, has some inserts of scenes from the 40's and 50's that are hokey, there is still too much Michael Moore. I'm sure there are things that are inaccurate.  I'm told that the wait times to see doctors in many universal healthcare systems are appalling, but by and large, you can see that we have allowed our own system to erode appallingly, in this film.....but it is much more than just a film. It is a wake up call. So join me, go see it. Wake up. This is one of the greatest countries in the world. It's time we got our priorities straight and started acting like it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>It's a travesty.  No, not Michael Moore's latest documentary, but the health care system.  Armed with anecdotes about horror stories coming from the uninsured, the underinsured, and a wide range of denied claimants, Moore gives us a lot of reasons to come inoculated when seeing his latest movie.<br /><br />'Sicko' is broad in scope.  Filming participants in each of the aforementioned categories, he goes through the history of universal health care's failure to be enacted in the United States.  From The Red Scare of the fifties until the sweeping campaign against Senator Clinton's proposal when she was first lady, we get some colorful and interesting presentation.  In addition to the benefits of these illuminating vignettes, we see other angles.  We hear confessions by representatives at different levels of the health insurance organizations and various health care providers.  Then we go over seas and across the border to get cross sections of three countries and how its citizens reflect and cope with their universal health care systems.<br /><br />***(SAMPLER ALERT:  IF YOU WANT TO GET THE GIST OF THE MOVIE WITHOUT A FEW EXAMPLES, THEN PLEASE READ NO FURTHER)*** This film has a plethora of testimony and personal stories, so I just want to give you a few free samples.<br /><br />DIAGNOSIS-<br />  ---An uninsured Oregon man had to choose between saving his index or ring finger after sawing both tips off.<br />  ---An older, middle-aged couple who "DID" have health insurance had to sell their home and live with their daughter.<br />  ---Some insurance applicants were denied because of the proportion of their height and weight.<br />  ---A man was denied a bone marrow transplant from a younger brother because it was called "Experimental".<br /><br />AGENTS-<br />  ---Health care insurers in league with some health care providers.

At one point, the `Star Wars' theme plays as the list of "uninsured" ailments and diseases goes up the screen like the familiar, intergalactic storyboard.  Oh, don't worry, there's more...<br /><br />`Sicko' made me enthralled and absorbed.  I loved the contrasts and information, but I felt there were a few sins of omission.  I don't contest what was "provided," but I thought it glossed over the frivolous lawsuits, even when there are plenty of legitimate ones.  Also, he skips over the downside of universal health care.  How can you not address this when Eleanor Clift on `McGlaughlin' conceded there where things wrong with Hilary Clinton's plan? (Of course that doesn't mean there shouldn't be a new proposal, but I thought it should have been addressed with his own counter-arguments.)  I loved the humor when it was prescribed, but I thought Moore relied too much on sarcasm.  Half the time it was funny; half the time it wasn't.<br /><br />Politically, I should 'fess up.  I have at times and on certain issues been conservative, liberal, moderate, malleable, and wavering.  Often I am all over the "chart".  Most of the time I confess I am both informed and clueless.  Having said that, despite the few weaknesses, Moore's 'Sicko' is a thought-provoking documentary that may very well be the best of the year.  No matter what your political stripes are, you should see this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>I will begin this review by stating that I am a proud American citizen, an immigrant from a Third World country who grew up in America.  I have also traveled around the world, and have experienced the health care systems in other countries.  I also have friends and family living in other countries, both developed and under-developed countries.  From my own experiences in America and in other countries, and those related to me by my friends and family, I've come to believe that the US healthcare system is extremely inefficient, corrupt, and unfriendly to customers.  If one were to consider slavery as 19th century America's national shame, then healthcare is probably the shame of our time.  Many individuals have tried to describe the failings of America's health care system in editorials, books, and news reports.  But this 2-hr long documentary captures the essence of these failures; both cause and effect, and the agents.  Sicko correctly reveals the fundamental cause: greed, and the system whereby greed is allowed to take people's lives: a deregulated, privately run health care system.  Taken together, this leads to a health care safety net with very big holes.  Importantly, Moore focuses only on those who do have insurance, and shows the loopholes that allow health care providers to deny care.  So instead of coming of as a paean to the poor and uninsured, this movie actually looks at those that have been insured; the working professionals both blue and white collar.  And as a good liberal, Moore contrasts the American system with those in Canada, Cuba, France and England.<br /><br />The failings of this movie are also numerous.  First of, Moore fails to elucidate the specific laws that have created our current health care system.  He only looks at one specific bill passed during the Nixon administration that sanctioned HMO's as the pre-eminent form of health care provider in the US.  The movie should have spent some time presenting the origins of worker-provided care, the origins of France's present health care system under Vichy rule, and differences in the health care education in different countries.  The US is unique in that one needs an undergraduate degree before entering medical school.  This by itself dramatically increases the time and cost incurred by doctors in training, which in turn raises their salaries.<br /><br />The 2nd major failing of this documentary is the very incomplete comparison of the US health care system to those in other countries.  Specifically, there were no comparisons with health care systems in Asia, such as those of Singapore, China and India.  The latter two produce many of America's best doctors and medical researchers.  The former, Singapore, has probably the world's best health care system in terms of cost/benefit ratio, access by all citizens to latest technical advances, and a strong orientation on customer satisfaction.<br /><br />A third major failing, and the biggest surprise of this movie, was the complete absence of mention of patient privacy.  I suspect Moore examined Iceland's system and came away with more questions than answers as to the need of patient privacy.  And probably the biggest failing of this movie is the absence of aggregate statistics.  Yes, Mr. Moore provides prices that specific individuals have had to pay for specific medical services and goods.  But Mr. Moore does not include important statistics like the trend in HMO deductibles and premiums over time, trends in Medicare and Medicaid spending (overall and per capita) over time, comparisons of per capita medical costs across different countries, etc, etc...  Nobody can argue with numbers, but lots of people can argue with anecdotal evidence, which is what this documentary almost exclusively presents.<br /><br />But overall, I still like and recommend this movie.  I believe the facts presented in the movie are correct, and I agree with Mr. Moore's opinion.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FEJIORC1MBG3.html">A2FEJIORC1MBG3</a><br/><p>Our favorite cuddly corn-fed agitprop filmmaker is back to stir up some doo-doo, spark national debate and make pinko-hatin' `murcan "patriots" twitch and shout.<br /><br />Moore grabs our attention right out of the gate with a real Bunuel moment. Over the opening credits, we are treated to shaky home video, depicting a man pulling up a flap of skin whilst patiently stitching up a gash on his knee with a needle and thread, as Moore deadpans in V.O. (with his cheerful Midwestern countenance) that the gentleman is an avid cyclist- and one of the millions of Americans who cannot afford health insurance.<br /><br />Moore doesn't waste any time showing us the flipside of the issue-even those who are "lucky" enough to have health coverage often end up with the short end of the stick as well. A young woman, knocked unconscious in a high speed auto collision and rushed to the ER via ambulance, was later denied coverage for the ambulance ride by her insurance company because it was not "pre-approved". She ponders incredulously as to exactly how she was supposed to have facilitated "pre-approval" in such a scenario (so do we).<br /><br />The film proceeds to delve into some of some of the other complexities contributing to the overall ill health of our current system; such as the monopolistic power and greed of the pharmaceutical companies, the lobbyist graft, and (perhaps most depressing of all) the compassionless bureaucracy of a privatized health "coverage" system that focuses first and foremost on profit, rather than on actual individual need.<br /><br />Kind of a downer, eh? Well, this is a Michael Moore film, so he gives you plenty of opportunities to laugh through the tears.  Most of the levity occurs as Moore travels abroad to the socialized nations of Canada, Britain, France and Cuba to do a little comparison shopping for alternate health care systems.<br /><br />The classic Moore moment arrives as he sails into Guantanamo Bay with a megaphone and a boatload of financially tapped Ground Zero volunteer rescue worker veterans who are all suffering from serious respiratory illnesses. After learning that the Gitmo detainees all enjoy completely free, round the clock medical care on the taxpayer's nickel,he figures that the state of the art prison hospital wouldn't mind offering the same services to some genuine American heroes. Of course,the personnel manning the heavily armed U.S. military patrol boats in the bay fail to see his logic, and they are unceremoniously turned away.<br /><br />Undeterred, he decides to give the Cuban health care system a spin. They are welcomed unconditionally, and receive prompt and thorough care. Is it a propaganda move by the Cubans? Probably. Does Moore conveniently fail to mention the "minuses" of the Cuban health care system (or the Canadian,British and French systems for that matter)? Sure-but who cares? The "plusses" greatly outweigh the "minuses", especially when compared to the current health care mess in the U.S. (at least he's showing enough sack to step up and give us some alternatives).<br /><br />Moore makes his point quite succinctly-the need for health care is a basic human need. It should never hinge on economic, political or ideological factors. As one of his astute interviewees observes, it is a right, not a privilege.<br /><br />In fact, this may qualify as the least political of Moore's films to date. Consequently, it may disappoint or perplex those who usually anticipate that a Moore film will give them a vicarious "let's go stick it to The Man" thrill. Things are not so black and white this time out; the issue is too complex. I don't think there is any filmmaker out there who could sum it all up in less than 2 hours, but Moore has done an admirable job of scratching the surface, and most importantly, he manages to do so in an entertaining and engaging fashion. After all, isn't that why we go to the movies?</p></br><a href="../users/A10C5CJK1YKGV0.html">A10C5CJK1YKGV0</a><br/><p>You would have to be a pretty hard heart-hearted person and stubborn to boot, if you couldn't watch Michael Moore's documentary `Sicko' and not be a concerned, troubled or a little worried.<br /><br />It's interesting to say the least, that of the few documentaries that Moore has done, this one has taken the least amount of flack, but also getting the smallest amount of press. I guess the message is in the movie, and you should come away with it if any of your humanity is still intact when it's all said and done. I'm sure the health-care industry can't wait for this film to just `go away' and drift quietly into the background and dusty used DVD bins.<br /><br />What can be said though of all the folks being dumped in downtown Los Angeles? Some might say: "Well, Moore didn't show that it probably happens in other countries and it's not the hospitals problem to house them."<br /><br />Living in Los Angeles, I can tell you, that the `patient-dumping' issue has been widely reported over the media for the last few years and has been looked at as incredibly embarrassing and absolutely the wrong solution for indigent patients. So if other Americans know that it's wrong, then it doesn't really matter who else is doing it as it should be obvious that `patient-dumping' probably happens in a lot of places, not just the United States. But maybe it doesn't? Maybe as well as a better health-care alternative, they also take care of their homeless as well? I can safely say that Social Workers `do' take care of the indigent patients before they leave the hospital and make sure they're not going to "heal up" on the streets with freshly bandaged wounds.<br /><br />But as a Veteran, I guess the worst part was the fact that 9-11 Rescue Workers have been so sorely neglected and allowed to fall through the cracks as Moore clearly evinced, and which was something that was without protestation. Doesn't that bother every other person who watched this film? I'm absolutely sure that it did. The fact that they went and received more exhaustive and complete care from a country that is 1) off-limits 2) lower on the list of `countries with the best health-care' than the US and 3) a country with very little to no resources, is a condemning statement on a completely intolerable situation.<br /><br />But, we will tolerate won't we? No one will rise up and protest and say that it's wrong, will they? Everybody's too busy with their low-riders, vacationing on a yacht, getting to work for their midnight shift, too wrapped up in their own lives to worry about `all these other people' who need health-care and a better system of long-term care.<br /><br />I read a few of the negative reviews on this film as well, out of curiosity, just to see what people were saying. The bulk of these people could seemingly benefit from some remedial education as they obviously have problems articulating complete sentences, shaping basic grammar and punctuation and a lack of an ability to crystallize their own ideas. It's a shame that we live in a country where people who aren't even mediocre at best, can seemingly try to shout down, detract, spew garbage and complete bombast while not even having a grasp of the concepts that they're trying to flag-wave about, let alone tear down.<br /><br />Maybe some intelligence first, might be a sound idea, before trying to blast others with a wet rag.</p></br><a href="../users/A9I40WFF40R4.html">A9I40WFF40R4</a><br/><p>Michael Moore tells us right away that this movie is not about the almost fifty million Americans who have no health coverage (18,000 of whom will die this year because they have no coverage) but the rest of us who have some type of health insurance. The stories he selects to tell will break your heart and depress you beyond measure. One patient has to select which tip of two fingers he will have re-attached after an accident. Another is turned down coverage for an ambulance bill to the hospital after a car accident because she did not get prior approval from the insurance company. (Never mind that she was unconscious because of the accident) Another couple had to move into a room in the basement of their child's house beause they could not afford co-pays from two serious illnesses, cancer and several heart attacks. A mother got to see her young child die because the hospital she took the gravely ill child to did not accept her health insurance. Another patient died from cancer because his health provider assessed a necessary bone marrow transplant as experimental. The disgusting list continues.<br /><br />Moore visits Canada, Great Britain and France to see the health plans in these countries that provide treatment at no cost to the patient as well as a controversial visit to Cuba. There is a touching scene where rescue workers from 9/11 visit Cuban firefighters and get much better treatment than they received in their own country.<br /><br />Is Moore always objective? Probably not. After all, he has a point to make. On the other hand, to my knowledge, no critic has yet come forward to accuse any of the people who tell their sad stories of lying on camera.<br /><br />There is enough blame to go around: the AMA, members of congress and the man now occupying the White House-- he makes only three brief appearances and at one time congratulates an American worker for holding down three jobs, telling her, "only in America." Of course her counterpart in France would have free health insurance, a 35-hour-a-week job and a month off a year for vacation. Let us not forget the drug companies, and finally, we the American taxpayers, who put up with such an unfair system.<br /><br />Most of us have our own bad experience with insurance companies, but we hope not as bad as the stories that these partipants in "Sicko" relate. It seems obvious that universal free health insurance is something that most of us will never live to see, a sad commentary on this the greatest nation on earth.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>It's no secret what a travesty privatized health care has become in this country, but leave it to political firebrand and social provocateur Michael Moore to present our dismal situation with his unique combination of passion and insouciance in this compelling 2007 documentary. Coupled with his innate showmanship, his dexterity in making his viewpoint seem like the logical one is what makes his films resonate in ways that make more fair-minded filmmakers pallid by comparison. This time, his target is almost too easy, that the entire health care industry needs to be overhauled. In order to prepare for his film, Moore made an open online plea to Americans to share their own health-care horror stories, and in turn, he received over 25,000 e-mails.<br /><br />The film's first half dives into the most egregious cases of those who paid their insurance premiums to feel secure about their medical coverage only to discover that their insurance companies abandon them when they needed them the most. Several of these accounts are inevitably heartbreaking, and Moore is wise to let those victimized by the system speak for themselves without his prodding. The capper is the 1996 Congressional testimony of Dr. Linda Peeno, a former medical examiner for Humana, who confesses that her top priority was to save the company money and how in turn, the company rewarded bonuses to examiners who denied the most number of claims. The second half shows Moore in more familiar form as he acerbically visits Canada, Great Britain, France, and Cuba, all countries where free health care is available.<br /><br />The international section is where Moore makes his most pointed jabs in showing how socialized medicine has worked almost too effortlessly elsewhere. Although he does not divulge the substantial amount of government funding needed to subsidize these programs, Moore successfully makes the intentional oversight beside the point, as these nations simply emphasize how dysfunctional our HMO system has become. Former Member of Parliament Tony Benn is particularly insightful in explaining the rationale behind free medical care in the U.K. and how it was borne out of the ongoing bombings going on during WWII. The most interesting and controversial sequence is when Moore takes a group of perpetually ill 9/11 volunteers by boat first to Guantanamo Bay to see if they can receive the same medical treatment being received by the terrorists imprisoned there and then to Havana to get the health care they have been denied in this country.<br /><br />The filmmaker somehow manages the precarious balance between funny and poignant throughout the film. He, however, is not without his self-aggrandizing moments, for example, in taking the occasional potshot at Bush, which while funny, is not terribly relevant here. What is pertinent is a taped conversation in 1971 between Nixon and his chief aide John Ehrlichman about passing legislation which would give birth to the current, profit-seeking concept of HMOs. Moore couldn't help himself by mentioning an anonymous $12,000 check to the Webmaster of an anti-Moore site, who could not afford his wife's mounting medical bills. Naturally, the anonymous donor was Moore. Regardless, he hits his valid points about the U.S. health care system hard and with both emotional precision and idiosyncratic finesse. For that alone, this film is essential viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5VLIJMDPWHI.html">A2C5VLIJMDPWHI</a><br/><p>I've never understood the cons of universal health care, but I always enjoy Michael Moore's films. I wanted to see this documentary for two reasons: #1 To find out why people are against universal health care, #2 To see what crazy thing Michael Moore would do to bring attention to it. I found this film fascinating. During my time as a freelancer, I remember being called several times about being examined for an ear infection that turned out to be stress. I was beyond belief that a health insurance company would even consider the idea of not providing health care for me for being tired. Seriously?! This film was eye opening, from the guy who lost his finger, how the 9/11 rescue workers were treated, why parents had to move in with their children and how much profit is made from the health insurance industry. I expected all of that, but what I didn't know was the health care insurance benefits in Cuba, Canada and Europe. Whether you're for or against health care (or Obamacare as it's been nicknamed recently), I think this is an educational film to learn more about the industry as a whole. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Note: That $12,000 donation was classic!</p></br></body></html>

I've seen great restorations before ("Goldfinger", "North By Northwest", "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang", "The African Queen", "The Italian Job" - see reviews for them all) - but this is exemplary.<br /><br />The full run of extras is dealt with in detail in Amazon's description above, but it's worth highlighting that among the superb new extras is Michael J Fox not afraid to show his present medical condition in the 6-part making-of that is spread across the whole set. There are contributions from almost all of the cast, Director Robert Zemeckis, Producer Steven Spielberg etc - and great on-set footage too. It's also been pitched at a reasonable price. In short, this is properly good value for money for 3 hugely entertaining films that don't seem to have dated at all.<br /><br />I can only add to the chorus of approval for this - a fantastic presentation.<br /><br />Onwards and upwards to the "Indiana Jones" and "Star Wars" Trilogies and the remaining Bond films - which were all Lowry Digital Restorations and look as awesome as this...</p></br><a href="../users/A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI.html">A2Q5Y2EMS6KDWI</a><br/><p>I originally had the trilogy collection on separate VHS tapes; what a joy it was when DVD re-introduced the "Back to the Future" series in a crisp, digital format. Several years later, these films have not lost their charm. Director Robert Zemeckis labeled BTTF "special-effects comedies", but they seem so much more. What's more enchanting than the notion of meeting your parents when they were in their teens? That's what teen Marty McFly (the terrific Michael J. Fox, at the height of his "Family Ties" TV fame) finds out in Part I as he's catapulted back to the innocent 50's in a Delorean time machine devised by his spastic but brilliant scientist friend (Christopher Lloyd, wonderfully quirky on a variation of "The Nutty Professor"). Doc Brown's warnings of "drastically altering the time continuum" get turned on their ear when Marty accidentally does alter the course of events leading to his parents falling in love, and that's part of the fun of the first film as Marty gets into close scrapes with bully Biff (a solid comic performance from Thomas Wilson) and fending off uncomfortable amorous advances from his Mom-to-be (Lea Thompson, in top form). Like Lloyd, Crispin Glover (who was in the first film but was replaced by "look-alike" actors appearing briefly in long shots for the sequels) is perfectly cast as Marty's nerdish loser father George. Part II is intricate & clever; perhaps TOO clever at times, because it's just as imaginative but lacks the heart of Part I. Picking up where Part I left off, Doc Brown whisks Marty & his girlfriend Jennifer (Elizabeth Shue filled the role in the sequels, riding a crest of success at the time with "Adventures in Babysitting" & "Cocktail") away to the near future to help correct events which will destroy their family & marriage. Marty's purchase of a sports almanac once again demonstrates what happens when you change history--this time, with darkly disastrous effect. What follows might be a first in movie sequels: Revisiting key events from the first film as Marty & Doc try to mend the time line by returning to the 50s. You have to admire the minds who came up with such cleverness. Part III brings the series full circle as it returns the charm of the first film--except the surroundings are different. After the flying Delorean gets zapped by lightning, Marty learns that Doc Brown is alive & well...in 1885! With the help of the 50's Doc, Marty goes back to rescue Doc from a fatal shooting by Biff's great grandfather, "Maddog" Tannen. A sweet but unexpected subplot twist has Doc falling in love with another science-minded person (Mary Steenburgen) which winds up complicating their journey back to the present. Both sci-fi & westerns are blended together here, capped with a dazzling FX-laden train ride as Doc & Marty attempt to "push" the Delorean through the time barrier.<br />There are many, many joke references to cultural icons & "how time repeats itself" which are stitched through the fabric of each film. Included are "making of" featurettes on each film. BTTF will remain one of my favorite movie trilogies!</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCPMT1RRS7K0.html">A1VCPMT1RRS7K0</a><br/><p>I'd forgotten how entertaining these movies are after not having seen them in a years.  Back to the Future was an incredibly successful trilogy of films running from the mid-80s into the early 90s.  The casting was amazingly solid and truly made the films stand out, along with special effects that were cutting-edge for the time.<br /><br />Christopher Lloyd is simply outstanding as the the nutty scientist, Crispin Glover perfectly portrays Marty's nerdy father and Lea Thompson is an interestingly provocative character as Marty's mother.  Michael J. Fox was a huge TV star when Part I was released - yet his fame made quite a quantam leap due to Part I and the subsequent movie franchise.<br /><br />The creativity that went into production is apparent in all three of the films.  They're each entertaining in their own ways.  Part I is definitely the most popular of the three.  Part II received mixed reviews and Part III was more like the first, but not quite as well received.  They're all worth seeing and they're all great movies.<br /><br />There is some debate over the formatting of the DVD versions of the film.  I don't see how it makes all that much difference, to be honest.  I watched all three films and enjoyed them, regardless of whether or not an inch of digital information was missing from the top or bottom of the screen.  The movies are wonderful, the bonus footage is extensive- loaded with "making of" footage, many deleted scenes, outtakes, etc, etc...<br /><br />If you enjoyed any of the three films, it is worth purchasing the Complete Trilogy, as the price is less than most single-feature DVDs on the market right now.  Great movies that make for great entertainment.  Highly recommended DVD set.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>I grew up on this Trilogy and still love every second of every film. You can't get much better than this for original storyline and characters. It takes the time travel theme and explores it in much greater depth than any previous film. Fox is superb as the various incarnations of the McFly family (with ground breaking effects for the time) and Christopher Lloyd plays the eccentric inventor to perfection. The time periods in the second and third film are rendered with such detail that you really become engrossed in the film and live it along with the characters. These films aren't heavy, serious movies, but they are brilliantly directed and acted and a great slice of family fun for a Sunday afternoon or just about anytime really. The extras are excellent and really add to your understanding of the whole series and are fascinating to watch in their own right. All in all, these are great films and are highly recommended, worth every penny.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>I consider the "Back To The Future" stable of films to be perhaps the best film trilogy ever conceived.  Here are a few of my thoughts on each individual film...<br /><br />Part One (*****): A film that completely defies the word genre, containing action, adventure, romance, drama, and a heaping dose of comedy to top things off!  Enough clever/subtle sight gags to keep you intrigued after multiple viewings!<br /><br />Part Two (*****): Basically a two-hour extension of the first installment...and what more could BTTF fans ask for?!  Still incredibly genre-diverse, while delving even deeper into the back (and future!) stories of your favorite characters.<br /><br />Part Three (****): Some of the jokes begin to fall a bit flat, but still a solid ending to the trilogy.  Viewers will appreciate some deeper character-development on an emotional level that was lacking from the first two films.<br /><br />If you have never immersed yourself in this incredible trilogy, please do so soon...before you run out of TIME!</p></br><a href="../users/ANAYSRE3LX8GZ.html">ANAYSRE3LX8GZ</a><br/><p>I did not make a mistake in my title, this is actually 4 (four) discs.<br /><br />This is a special edition of the trilogy released for region 4 and maybe 2 (Australia/Europe) so beware if you don't know anything about region coding, you may find this edition wont work on American/Canadian DVD players. (should be good on DVD roms tho)<br /><br />The first 3 discs are that of the trilogy, the discs are just the same filled with there bonus features ect...<br /><br />the 4th disc contains<br />- Audio recording of Bob Gale and Robert Zemckis Q&A (previously it was just subtitle text) - however this would be so much better as an audio commentary as it is nothing but sound, they could have at least put a slide show or something to this.<br />- Enhanced Conversation with Michael J.Fox<br />- Deleted scenes from the first 2 movies. Until recently in the new special release of BTTF, these scenes had not been released anywhere else. Scenes to note that where not on the original cut scenes are from BTTF 1 showing the full version of Doc showing his "permit" to the cop, and Marty questions if he will go back to 1985 gay. Also from BTTF 2 you find out that the old guy asking Marty to put some money on the Cubbies is actually Terry from 1955 who fixes Biff's car. As well as many other scenes that have additional audio commentary.<br /><br />- Production Design.<br />- Story Boarding.<br />- Designing the Delorean<br />- Time Travel<br />- The evolution of visual FX shots.<br />- Power Of Love (Huey Lewis) Music Video.<br />- Production Notes<br />- Making of BTTF 3<br />- Audio Recording Q&A for BTTF 3<br />- Designing Hill Valley<br />- Designing the campaign<br />- The secrets of the BTTF trilogy.<br />- FAQ's about the trilogy<br />- Production notes<br /><br />There are a lot of features on this disc that are not released for region 1. So if your a big enough fan, the 4th disc is well worth getting your hands on.</p></br><a href="../users/A13OMT8D4GPIBV.html">A13OMT8D4GPIBV</a><br/><p>After years of waiting, Back to the Future is finally released to DVD.

Allt the disks have what a good box set should have: animorphic widescreen, 5.1 surround sound, digital mastering, extras, comentary, and a good movie. The original back to the future is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The two sequels are just fine, but I think that the franchise should have ended with the first. I give the first film five stars and the two sequels about three stars. Very recomended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TDK8D4HEMUYW.html">A2TDK8D4HEMUYW</a><br/><p>Time travel films have had some major impacts on the film industry over the years, but even more so on American culture. You can look back to some of the earliest films and detect a hint of sci-fi / time travel in them; just take a look at H.G. Well's "The Time Machine." However, I think the biggest and best time travel film ever made is the 1985 hit "Back to the Future." Here is the plot summary:<p>It is 1985. Marty McFly (a young Michael J. Fox) lives in the small town Hill Valley, located in the middle of nowhere, and is friends with the town eccentric, Professor Emmet Brown (Christopher Lloyd) who, unknown to Marty, has just built a time machine after thirty years of ideas. A time machine that runs off plutonium.<br />After some unfortunate incidents occur, Marty accidentally travels thirty years back in time using the time machine, which is made "out of a Delorean!" - to 1955! Now, his only hope of getting "back to the future" is to hunt down the inventor of the machine: Doc Brown. Only a few problems; not only has Professor Brown not invented the time machine at this point in time, but Marty has also interfered with the past - by accidentally keeping his parents (Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover) from meeting, therefore disrupting the space-time continuum and keeping Marty from being born! (Also, keep in mind that his parents are his age in 1955.)<p>"Back to the Future" could be called a very controversial film. After all, after traveling to 1955, Marty's mother develops a crush on him. I would call that pretty controversial. However, unlike some other films, the controversy is not the only thing "Back to the Future" has going for it. There are many things that make this movie great. I'll analyze the plot first; not only does it have fun with the notion of time travel, but it sets a character that we care about in situations that we want him to be in. Let me expand on this...<p>I get tired when time travel films have a great premise, but get mixed up in boring subplots and fail to play with ideas they could have. A lot of people love "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure." I'll admit that was a good time travel film, but "Back to the Future" plays with the actual notion of time travel much, much more, and by doing so creates some major laughs and "thinking" moments.<p>"Back to the Future" also has a great sense of direction. [...].<p>Produced by Steven Spielberg, directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd, "Back to the Future" gets 5/5 stars from me - it has originality, humor, great actors, an excellent plot, and mind-boggling "what ifs." it has to be one of my favorite movies, and if you see it, it might become one of your favorites, also.</p></br><a href="../users/A28B7IJR80M8KE.html">A28B7IJR80M8KE</a><br/><p>When viewed back-to-back, these 3 films could be one movie, however you look at it, the original film released in 1985 is a classic, it begins in a rather quiet fashion, where we see the homestead of Doc Brown who it seems has an endless aray of clocks, all set at the same time,we are given a glimpse of this man & his personality, soon Marty(Michael J. Fox) enters & hooks up to one of Doc's oversized amplifiers that explodes if set on high, propelling Marty across the room in a rather comical scene, where Marty quotes> "Rock-n-Roll" we realize that Marty is a typical 80's teenager that hangs out with Doc, probably because he is fun to be around,as Doc introduces his new invention, a time-traveling DeLorean, he is soon ambushed by terrorist that he stole plutonium from, the DeLoren's power source,he is killed & Marty flees in an attempt to escape, which he does into the year 1955, where he has to get in touch with Doc's younger counterpart to find a power source capable of sending him back, in the process he interrupts his parents first meeting, altering his existence, this is intense as Marty now has to get his parents together while the 1955 Doc has to find a power source since plutonium is non-existent in 1955, they realize a bolt of lightning can substitute the source, since history says it will strike the town clock tower at 10:04 on Nov 12,1955, the 1950's culture is neat to say the least, not only does Marty have to reunite his parents, but he has to make a decision whether or not to inform Doc of his inpending fate in 1985, getting his parents together is intense to say the least, but once he does, the real intensity is getting back as him & Doc argue about his inpending fate, as you can guess, everything that can go wrong does,but Doc gets Marty back to 1985 successfully, won't spoil it for those who have not seen it, which is probably minimal at best, but they are successful after all, the second film is fun but un-even, the futuristic 2015 is less convincing in its approach, one can only guess what it will really be like, I just wish they would have done a "Blade Runner"-like setting instead, this is the only aspect that falls short on the second film, the hellish 1985 that Marty & Doc encounter as they return to their time is consequentual in how time-travel can be misused, they discover that Biff(the first film's bully) has somehow stolen the DeLorean in 2015 as an old man with a sports almanac with sports dates from 1950 to 2000 to travel back to 1955 & give it to his younger self in the hopes of acquiring millions in wealth, which his younger self does creating an alternate 1985 for Marty & Doc, who now have to travel back to 1955 during Marty's first trip to retrieve the almanac thus settngs thing back the way they were, they are once again successful, but soon the same lightning storm that sent Marty back in the first film has now struck Doc in mid-air whose DeLorean now has a hover-conversion, thus sending Doc back to 1885, where Marty now has to go to get Doc, which in turn sets up the third film, which re-captures the warm feeling of the first film, we see Hill Valley as it looked during th old west, & Marty & Doc's attempt to once again get back to 1985, but Doc soon falls for Clara(Mary Steenburgen) who is a local, the lightning bolt destroyed the hover-conversion, & now Doc & Marty's only hope for getting back is pushing the DeLorean up to 88 MPH, which they do on a railroad track, since there are no roads or gas, by hijacking a train, like the first film, Murphy's Law happens once again, but they once again pull it off, with Doc staying behind with Clara, the western landscapes are by far good to look at, the filmakers definately give it a western feel, the same as in the first film's 1950's look, & is a great trilogy in all fairness, despite the second film's flaws, the third more than makes up for it!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2FFYQZPUGOX58.html">A2FFYQZPUGOX58</a><br/><p>If you are Lorraine you are a good mother, but the haze of alcohol doesn't hide your regrets of decisions past.

After watching it, I bought the entire trilogy and the results are awesome!!!.<br /><br />Back to the Future (1985):<br />BTTF is a great film because it has a lot of elements in the right place. It's funny, the cast is impeccable, the premise is original and smart, is really entertaining and the friendship between Doc and Marty feels genuine giving the movie a heart. Zemeckis accomplished a film that in other hands could've been a complete mess but here, it's completely unerstandable and not hard to follow. BTTF is a truly classic that has stood the test of time and is my favorite of the trilogy. Simply a masterpiece.<br /><br />Back to the Future part II (1989):<br />Sequels, as we know are dangerous propositions that can either expand the story in glourious ways or sink it in the deep bottom of oblivion. Fortunately, BTTF2 is not the case of a bad sequel and indeed it expands the story in interesting ways. The movie has a lot of elements that made the first so good but also it complicates things more and takes the adventure to new levels. We go to the year 2015, an alternate 1985 and we go back again to 1955. The special effects are really good, although some of them seem dated by today's standards. Still, the story is really good and keeps you involved the whole time. The cast as always is impecable and it is also worth noting that this is the darkest film of the three.<br /><br />Back to the Future part III (1990):<br />The third film in a trilogy is usually the worst one. But sometime is always the best (TS3), in this case BTTF3 is not the best of the three but is still really good and concludes the trilogy in a high note. The movie is lighter than the previous one and a little bit more entertaining too. The western setting is spectatucar and surprinsingly it works really well. The characters of Marty and Doc Brown end as full rounded characters and in the case of Doc Brown we see him in a completely new perspective. This movie is full of humor, romance and great action sequences. It is really high quality entertainment.<br /><br />Video & Audio<br />All three BTTF films were given full restorations with impressive results. The image in all three is clear, crisp, full of contrast and detail. Skin tones are mostly natural and grain is visible though not annoying. Sometimes the image looks a little soft but that's because of the techniques that they used to film them. A faithful and outstanding tranfer for all of them. Thank you Universal.<br /><br />In the audio department, all three films feature 5.1 DTS-HD MA and the results are great. Dialogue is crystal clear, the music sounds clear and there is no sign of hissing or other annomalies. A great audio presentation.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br />This package is full of bonus material spread across the three discs. The most note-worthy is a six part new documentary newly created for this set that are called "Tales from the Future" spread across the three movies. In the first movie you have "In the Beginning...", "Time to Go" and "Keeping Time". In the second movie you have "Time Flies" and in the third you have "Third Time's the Charm" and "The Test of Time". This six-part documentary is incredible as all the people involved in the making of the films discuss everything that was done with the trilogy. It's a piece that should not be missed. Alsoyou have archival documentaries from previous releases, audiocomentaries, galleries, trailers, The Back to the Future Night with Leslie Nielsen  and The Back to the Future Ride (both are great), deleted scenes, The Phiysics of Back to the Future and much more.<br /><br />You also have Digital Copies of the three films.<br /><br />My set also came with a Hot Wheels DeLorean replica.<br /><br />Closing Thoughts:<br />The BTTF trilogy is one of the best that have been released and regardless which one is your favorite (mine's the first), the three of them offer high quality entertainment. With great restorations and a good amount of bonus material including a spectacular new documentary, Universal have made this set a must-own for everyone. Highly recommended!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AOTMP0OKJOUWI.html">AOTMP0OKJOUWI</a><br/><p>I think we all know by now the true fans have the DVD versions of something (really big fans with money have Blu-Ray or whatever).  This is a great collection of what I think is one of the best trilogies ever made. It's fun, actiony, with plenty of humor and random and contradictory sci-fi. What more could you want?  The three movies are there, plus the usual fun assortment of bonus features.  Great collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A155X6KYOPQEZ5.html">A155X6KYOPQEZ5</a><br/><p>The Back to the Future trilogy is GREAT! I bought it a year ago and it is outstanding. I don't see how other reviewers could criticize this trilogy because there is NOTHING wrong with mine. The "widescreen" isn't off the page or anything. The trilogy is just like any other. As for the actual movies, they're amazing. Back to the Future is one of my favorite movies. (especially when I like the idea of time travel) The delorean is what really brings out all the movies. As for others, I definately recommend this to you!</p></br><a href="../users/A1OBJ2263JCK5.html">A1OBJ2263JCK5</a><br/><p>Just recently my six year old came to me with an urgent problem. He just had to see a movie "with time travel in it!" I'm sure there are lots of sci-fi/fantasy films that would fit the bill, but the first thing to pop into my mind were the iconic '80s "Back to the Future" series of films.<br /><br />Years ago, I had a ball watching this entertaining yet, convoluted Sci-Fi trilogy. The films feature high schooler/amateur musician, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and his friend & employer, scientist, Dr. Emmett "Doc" Brown (Christopher Lloyd) as they go back and forth (in a Delorean sports car/time machine) between the past (1955/1885), present (1985) and future (2015). They are trying to to fix the "time continuum" that has been mucked up, when Marty accidentally (in Part I) keeps his parents (Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson) from meeting and falling and love in 1955. Marty must get them back together or else he and his family will cease to exist! From there a whole series of time vexing conundrums are set to happen with ripple effects in both the distant future (Part II) and the long ago past of the 'Wild West (Part III).<br /><br />Well, I showed these three films to my six year old and not only did he enjoy them, but he became fanatical about them! Like, most kids, once he saw the series, he wanted to re-watch it over and over again. Now, in most cases, watching the same thing a few zillion times might drive the average parent nuts. But not in this case. It seems like no matter how many times you watch these three films, you will discover something new, that you hadn't realized or connected before. Robert Zemeckis & Bob Gale's scripts work brilliantly together. They remind me of a 'Rubik's Cube' or one of those old M. C. Escher illustrations that seems to go on into infinity. Eventually if you watch these films enough times, it becomes clear there are plotlines, details, dialogue and themes, that keep re-occurring in patterns over and over again between characters and generations, no matter what the year is. These three films are just the ultimate in the ideal of movie sequels. Each film really does depend on the other to tell a truely complete story.<br /><br />Besides the brilliant scripts the films also offer wonderful acting performances (especially Fox, Lloyd and Thomas S. Wilson as various bullys in the Tannen family tree), good special effects (which still pretty much hold up for modern day, CGI savey viewers) and a majestic, memorable score, which will stick in your head for days. The three films have now been put together in a three DVD box set called "Back to the Future: The Complete Trilogy". This includes over ten hours of 'extras' including audio commentaries, documentaries, deleted scenes, outtakes ETC.<br /><br />These films will both overwork your brain and excite your imagination! Highly recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Despite being slightly dated, a lot of the films from the 1980's, such as "E.T", "Gremlins", "the Princess Bride", as well as Robert Zemeckis' "Back to the Future" trilogy, manage to be good films in their own right and yet hold a special place because of how often they were watched or how influencing they were to our childhood. While one is the most well-known and best of the 3, each of the films in the trilogy has their own strengths that create a satisfying whole. Combined into one set, you can watch the gigantic time-travelling story and not only have fun in doing so but remembering how strong they were to us growing up.<br /><br />The first film finds Marty McFly, an aspiring musician in 1985, friends with eccentric/brilliant scientist Dr. Emmett "Doc" Brown, who has just invented something extraordinary: a time-travelling car built out of a DeLorean. But trouble happens and Marty is transported to 1955 and interferes with his mother meeting his father. Not only stuck but having to somehow get his parents together, Marty finds out more about his parents and with the help of Doc, has to get Marty back home.<br /><br />The second film has Marty, along with Doc and Marty's girlfriend Jennifer having to travel to 2015 to correct a familial problem. However, upon returning to 1985, things are incredibly worse and they find out that old Biff Tannen, the bully from the first film, went back in time and allowed his younger self to become rich and powerful. Now Marty and Doc have to correct the timeline while trying to avoid interfering with the actions of their "other" selves.<br /><br />The third film has Doc accidentally sent back to 1885 and Marty stranded in 1955. But he founds out Doc ends up getting killed a week after writing a letter to Marty so rather then go home, Marty travels to the Old West to rescue his old friend. However with technology being vastly underdeveloped as well as a possible love interest for Doc and Biff's ancestor wrecking havoc, Marty has to finally get back to his own time and hope Doc wants to come with him.<br /><br />Unlike let's say Pirates of the Caribbean or the Matrix trilogies which felt more like a stand-alone followed by a gigantic film cut in 2, the films in Back to the Future have more of a continuing story but each film feels distinctive unto itself to warrant any watching of any sequel at any time since they're so familiar. But they are separated by cliffhangers and it helps to watch them all to get a feel for the films as a whole. On that note, the first is an undisputed classic that never seems to age despite some relative obviousness of special effects. It's the sequels that become the interesting one since I liked the ingenuity of the second but found it a bit darker, less funny while the third had a good concept and tonally was similar to the first but just not a good story overall. But the films are so enjoyable that it doesn't really matter in the end so it's all fun anyway.<br /><br />Each film contains some good featurettes like a making-of made at the time, a retrospective, a scene-specific (though kind of dull) commentary, a Q&A commentary track where Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale answer questions from audience members, deleted scenes, a Michael J. Fox subtitle track a la Matrix's "White Rabbit" and a trivia track similar to the Abyss. The special features are welcome, unfortunately they just feel slight and don't seem as in-depth as you'd like for such classic films.<br /><br />I'd very much recommend the set for those who loved the films as well as the maybe 3 of you who have never seen it and can enjoy it whenever you want.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>The second movie is my favorite, where the gang goes into the future and experiences a world quite different from the mid 80's.  I was a child from the 80's, and remember these movies well, and I also remember back in the day everyone thinking that the future would be exactly like this movie portrayed it to be like.  It wasn't, at least not *yet* in the year 2007 (in the movie, they go to the year 2015, so unless some major changes happen in the next eight years, all those flying vehicles and life-like television screens will probably not be happening in our reality any time soon).  It was just a lot of fun to sit there and think that back in the 80's, people really thought our world was going to change THAT drastically.  Lots of fun scenes.<br /><br />Anyway, I haven't seen the second movie in quite a long time, and was surprised that the quality of the storytelling has held up extremely well through the years, and the movie doesn't look like your typical 80's film either (you know, with lots of dated-sounding loud saxophone playing, yuck!)  I was also surprised that the characters actually went back to the year 1955 for quite a long time.  Talk about telling a story with lots of twists and turns.  Awesome!<br /><br />These are seriously some of the most exciting movies that have ever existed.  The first movie is a classic, and the third one is really good as well, even though many people point to the third movie as being the obvious weakpoint in the series.  Maybe, maybe not.  I don't really know.  I just know I love these films and wanted to comment on how well they've held up after all this time.  A series of movies that are worth watching over and over again, and I normally only watch movies once or twice.  Not in this case.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ.html">A1NV8HZTGKIPXQ</a><br/><p>The summer of 1985. What a wonderful time in the cinemas that was for a little kid like me. After witnessing "The Goonies", another cherished childhood movie, I went and saw the first BTTF movie. Another defining childhood moment at the movies. The wonder and magic of that first film, and the subsequent sequels, is still strong today. All of the wonderfulness that is the original movie and the trilogy as a whole, is collected here in this box set with a worthwhile pile of fun and wonderful extras. Since you already probably know the films and stories, there is no real need to go into detail with all three films. The basic premise is teenager Marty McFly(Michael J. Fox)going into the past to 1955, thanks to Doc Brown(Christopher Lloyd) and his DeLorean time machine, and has to get his mother and father together or he will never be born. The resulting sequels has Marty and the Doc going into adventures in the future(part 2), and going back to the wild, wild west(part 3). There is no denying the wonderful and whimsical charm and brilliance of the original film, thanks to Robert Zemeckis' wonderful direction and script(with Bob Gale), the endearing characters, and many wonderful set pieces. The sequels don't fail to entertain, but the original can't be touched. Part 2 was all over the place and showcased Zemeckis and Gale's wonderful vision and creativeness. Part 3 was more simpler, and returned to the softer charm of the original. The load of extras here is a major treat. All 3 films come with the same set of extras. Deleted scenes, outtakes, music videos, screen tests, etc. The little documentaries and behind the scenes stuff is great. All 3 films come with short specials that were originally done at the time of each film's release. All 3 also come with new documentaries discussing each film, and the second one finally tells me why Crispin Glover didn't reprise his role. Director/co-writer Robert Zemeckis and co-writer Bob Gale are the main people present in all 3. Fox appears here and there. No Lea Thompson. No Thomas Wilson. No Christopher Lloyd(I hear he never does interviews). No Crispin Glover. That was kind of disappointing. Otherwise, it's fun stuff. There is also some page to screen comparisons, and some behind the scenes look at the hoverboard creation and designing the town square of Hill Valley. This is definitley a collection worthy of high praise, and worthy of being in your own DVD collection. It's a series of films that are looked upon very fondly, and rightfully so. That summer of 1985 was one that made huge impressions on me, and BTTF can be thanked for that. Pick it up.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QQHIY23PL7H3.html">A2QQHIY23PL7H3</a><br/><p>This is a great set that collects all three "Back to the Future" movies for an affordable price. Michael J. Fox is Marty McFly, a slacker high school kid who gets into wacky adventures with his inventor friend, Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). The first movie is a trip to the past, where Marty meets his parents and interrupts their courtship, thereby endangering his own existence. In the second film, a trip to the future wreaks havoc on the present, and Marty must jump to the past again to set things right. The final movie has Marty travelling to the old west to rescue Doc before he's gunned down by a gang of bandits. Overall, when you watch the three movies together, there is a strong sense of character development and continuity. Lots of little details and flourishes make the time travel aspects consistent unto themselves and make the world believable. Traditionally the second and third movies haven't faired as well critically, but in hindsight all three are tremendous fun and instant classics.<br /><br />A lot of extras on this set, as the producers aren't afraid to dig into the movie's development, discuss time travel, and generally have a good time. There are deleted scenes, special effects featurettes, and the infamous making-of documentary that aired in the 90s. A very strong package.<br /><br />When Universal first released this set, there was a framing error with the second and third movies. I don't know if the disc exchange is still effective, but as of now you should be able to pick up a new copy and be confident that it's a corrected edition. Look for a 'V2' on the fine print of the second and third movie discs to be sure.<br /><br />Back to the Future ranks up there with the Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Godfather of 'Holy Grail' trilogies. Get it.</p></br><a href="../users/A5WMBIOGE8Q6N.html">A5WMBIOGE8Q6N</a><br/><p>I bought the trilogy for 40 bucks.  Back to the Future epitomizes youthful vision of future possiblities; classic science fiction humor of spaceman from mars; a bridging of two generations where the younger generation realized the older generation had their own standards of hip and fair play; a friendship between a wacky wild eyed scientist and a protoge; a comic strip injection of sci -fi fun;  a cramed schedule of events not to be distrubed or changed; the protrayal that the past as more clean, stylish, and exciting; a fair amount of crudity and surprising range of liberty allowing Biff freedom to swear;  a mean social statement of rape or molestation by Biff as a betrayal of the social purity of the fifties; Biffs desire to take possession of Loren in all time periods; rule breaking convert undertakings yielding to smoking and drinking;  a reoccurring center focus on the year 1955; a emotionally charged music sound track;  tons of historical memorabila, names (Hepburn and Reagan), cars, songs (Mr Sandman); a insecure, ackward, greasy hair father who complancy and ackwardness is unsettling; a smashingly cool Toyota 4x4; a Jimmy Hendrix rendition of "Johnny be Good";  a lettermans jacket, sneakers, and a skate board;  a truck load of cow manure in Biffs car; a chess game with time;  a clock tower that needs funding in all times; three love stories: Marty, Doc, and Parents; and an ice cold Deloran.<p>The fifties introduced the beginnings of social rebellion by the youth.  Under the tight tumb of their parents teenages sought to break the rules: make out in the back of the convertible, sneaking the old womans liquor, and smoking in the park lot.  <p>The future include cyborg implants, social interactive computers, flying cars, and virtual reality interactions.  The past was neatly packaged and put on museum display.<p>The wild west was rugged individualism, bandits and outlaws, and hangings over 80 dollars.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ICHEO78NFE4Y.html">A3ICHEO78NFE4Y</a><br/><p>I'm not usually a person that likes this kind of movie(s), but i have to admit that they are great fun even though some of the facts couldn't really happen even if this stuff could be true. How can anyone not like Michael J. Fox.  He is the appitimiy of humorious fun and basically a good actor and actually has a very nice stage bio besides.You can be in a coma, or even be brain dead and still enjoy this weird collection of DVDs.  If anything they are worth hearing in 5.1 Stereo Sound and seeing in the proper screen format.  So i have to admit even an old foogy like me can really get off on this set of entertaining films. It's good clean fun for the whole entire family.</p></br><a href="../users/AAI57M3OXP5NK.html">AAI57M3OXP5NK</a><br/><p>I am so excited they are releasing all three of these movies in a box set.  I have been waiting forever for this to come out on DVD.  Back To The Future was the biggest movies in 1985 grossing 210 Million dollars.  The sequel I thought was just as good if not even a little better released in 1989 but it was unfortunate that it didn't do as well as the first.  The third on released in 1990 went back to the west, I thought this was the weakest of the three but finished up the series on a well note.  I can't wait for the DVD Boxed Set!</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z9XBCYT3AHHU.html">A2Z9XBCYT3AHHU</a><br/><p>YIPPEEEE!!!! It is finally here on DVD!

Robert Zemeckis does a masterful job of combining Spielberg-era special-effects magic with a script that conjures up ever giddier heights of hilarity. Just when you think it can't get any funnier or cleverer, Zemeckis ups the ante. Helping him do so are the brilliant cast, led by Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. Fox's performance can only be described as a cross between the young Mickey Rooney and the young Bob Hope, and I can think of no higher praise. As for Lloyd, only Gene Wilder in the modern cinematic era can match Lloyd's sublime comic derangement. It's too bad, then, that the sequels fall so short of the standard set by the original. Back to the Future II--depicting the chaos done to posterity when Biff steals the time-traveling DeLorean for a joy ride--matches the original in cleverness and perfection of structure, but it's so mean-spirited that it's hard to watch. Considering the constant pummeling Marty McFly takes in this installment, only people who hate Michael J. Fox could really enjoy it!  Back to the Future III, which sends Marty and Doc Brown back to the Wild West, recaptures the original's sweetness, but unlike the first two has plot holes you can drive a stagecoach through. I might watch the sequels occasionally, but only to remind myself how much better the original is.</p></br><a href="../users/A5AIEA4LXWJH3.html">A5AIEA4LXWJH3</a><br/><p>I bought the Blu-Ray set.  I agree - it is very hard to get the disks out and back in.  The video and audio are great.  But, the reason I am writing this review is because of what happened after I paused the movie for a while, and the screen saver kicked in.  I came back and hit "Pause" again, and a message popped up saying that was not allowed.  The same thing with the "Play" button.  I had to restart the movie from the beginning.</p></br><a href="../users/A1IUI3CJUMB7J0.html">A1IUI3CJUMB7J0</a><br/><p>A great movie series that dosent get old over time. As soem 80's film's you watch it's old and the laughs are old but not with this series. The acting is great and the story is great. I loved the first movie it has a great story and it's original. The second film is not good but it's an ok sequal but compared to the first and last one it's bad, the story is confussing at times but at times not. The third and final movie is great and as good as the first, the acting is nott he greatest but it's still great.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DZKOOMMJM1MI.html">A1DZKOOMMJM1MI</a><br/><p>Anyone who's not a fan of the 'Back to the Future' trilogy should be locked up for some sort of treason to the world of entertainment. Though the first movie is the only one which can be said to stand alone as a whole story, it's when the three of them are put together as one complete adventure that things really get good. In fact, everyone should make a point of watching all three 'Back to the Future' movies in a back-to-back marathon at least once in their lives. Allow the occasional toilet break, of course, but no more than that.<p>Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd stars as the troublesome teen and madcap scientist who do their time-travelling in style, courtesy of a revamped DeLorean. Their adventures over the course of the three incredible movies take them from 1985, to 1955, back to 1985, on to 2015, 1985 again(!), 1955 again(!!) and the wild wild west of 1885 (!!!) before returning home to 1985 in time for tea and a couple of Huey Lewis tracks. It features quite possibly the only sequel ever in which a large chunk takes place within its own predecessor, and definitely the only trilogy to feature Christopher Lloyd leaping around the outside of a moving train rescuing a damsel in distress. Lea Thompson, the brilliant character actor Crispin Glover, Elisabeth Shue, Billy Zane and the marvelous Thomas F. Wilson are among the other members of a fine supporting cast. And is that really Flea from the Red Hot Chilli Peppers popping up as squeaking bad boy Douglas J. Needles? Yup, that's right , something for everyone!<p>Go out, buy this collection, watch it repeatedly and, when you're not watching, keep the three discs in a glass display case which only very special friends are invited round to see. At this price, there are NO excuses. Do it now. Right now. Go. You'll thank me later, why are you still here?</p></br><a href="../users/AEGR40GALMDJ4.html">AEGR40GALMDJ4</a><br/><p>In this review I am only going to review the first installment because I have not yet seen the other two.  Back to the Future is a true Blast!  The movie is a whimsical movie that you will expect from Spieldberg.  It is not predictable in any sense.  The movie is definately a modern blockbuster classic.  It is completely different than any other time travel movie.  It is whimsical and less scientifical and complicated like we see in most time travel films.  The acting, sound, effects, and plot are all good.  See it, I highly reccomend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G0VFQ9198IUF.html">A1G0VFQ9198IUF</a><br/><p>3 superb movies in 1 bundle.  who never wished that they could go through time.  each disk has features like filmography's and lots more.  a tough plastic case.  i recommend to any body that is a fan of the movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F3B6HY9RJI04.html">A3F3B6HY9RJI04</a><br/><p>This has always been one of my favorite series of all time. Especially the first and third installment of this wild, wild ride. So the minute I saw this available for preorder on Blu-Ray I was all over it.<br /><br />The sound is amazing and the picture is clear and beautiful. Notice I dropped a star on the review? It wasn't for the second movie (though the second movie is worth the demotion) but for the graphics being too good. Yes, too good. The graphics were so good you could see the actor's make-up. I don't think the producers expected to see this in high definition so you can really see the make-up and masks when they are trying to disguise or age a character.<br /><br />I'm so glad these came in. We watched them all almost instantly and intend to do that every year or so. I love traveling back and forth through time with Marty and Doc! I'm so glad they put this together in one beautiful package.

I dont usually watch them cause I dont have all the time in the world to do that, but there were a lot of fun to watch. And the outtakes were really funny. Glad they had those to put on these discs.<br /><br />Back to the Future: Part 1<br /><br />-Great Scott!<br /><br />In 1985, Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) asks Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), a high school teenager, to meet him at the local mall for a late night science experiment. When Marty shows up, he sees Doc backing a Delorean out from a van. But this just isn't any Delorean. This Delorean has been modified into a time machine. As Doc begins to explain how it all works, a group of terrorists that Doc stole some uranium from, show up and begin to wreak havoc. Marty jumps in the car and floors it after witnessing Doc getting shot. But as soon as Marty hits the magic number of 88mph, he is shot back in time to 1955. While trying to figure out how to get back to 1985, he screws up the first time his parents meet, which begins the slow cycle of his brother, his sister, and even himself to slowly fade away from existence. Marty must figure out a way to get the time machine to work again and also somehow get his popular mom to fall in love with is geeky father so he can get back to the future.<br /><br />Talk about a movie that just never gets old. Almost all the laughs are still funny. From the barn scene, to the first time Marty meets his mom as a teenager, to the skateboarding/poop scene. Back to the Future really is just a very fun movie. I think I was smiling almost through the whole thing and I've had to have seen this movie over 20 times by now. I think almost everyone has wished they could go back in time, but who really thinks about going back to hang with their parents. After seeing this movie, it might really be fun to do just that. We know Marty's mom preaches about how girls shouldn't chase guys and things, but when we see her at a younger age, she is doing exactly what she forbids her own children from doing. And when he comes across his dad, he finds out things that he never knew his dad was interested in. And then of course we have Doc Brown, who Christopher Lloyd played perfectly. His antics, and screams, facial expressions, and over the topness were done just right. What a great character. And Michael J. Fox also plays Marty McFly just right to. To think that Eric Stoltz almost played Marty McFly. Thankfully the director thought he just didn't fit the part and refilmed it with Fox.<br /><br />Honestly, I could go on and on and on about this movie and just tell the whole story. But what fun would that be. Just own this movie.<br /><br />P.S. - I love watching old 80's flicks and seeing all the stuff that was cool back then. Also I really like seeing old advertisements or signs. Like the Pepsi symbol back then. Classic stuff.<br /><br />-----------------------<br /><br />Back to the Future: Part 2<br /><br />-We gotta go back in time to save the future that we messed up when someone went back to the past and screwed it up. Yep.<br /><br />The day after Marty gets back from 1955, Doc leaves in the time machine to go the future to the year 2015, only to return seconds later (though much more time has passed for Doc). Something terrible happens in the future to Marty's son. Thankfully Marty and his son are the spitting image of each other so Doc has come up with a plan to have Marty take the place of his son for a few minutes to make a correct decision to prevent the bad incident from happening. But while they are in the future, the Biff we know from 1955 and 1985 overhears Marty and Doc talking about their time machine. So Biff decides to change his crappy life by stealing the time machine and going back to 1955 with a sports almanac with all the winners of every sport up to the year 2000. So when Marty and Doc make it back to 1985, it's a very different 1985 than the one that they left. After figuring out what happened, they must once again go back to 1955 to prevent the almanac from being used by Biff so they can save the future that they know. Whew.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of the second movie of the trilogy. It used to be my favorite of the trilogy. Probably because of the flying cars and the hover board. Also the more in depth time traveling was definitely nice to have, even though you had to suspend a little bit of belief of how time travel works. Because honestly if Biff goes back in time and changes time, then time should've altered while Marty and Doc were in 2015. To me, the 2015 scenes were cool, but the movie becomes a lot better when they go back to 1955 again. It was a lot of fun to see Marty watching himself do the things he was doing in the first movie. Like when you see him low crawling under a window of the car that part 1 Marty is sitting in with his teenage version of his mother from 1955. Also it was funny to see Fox play multiple characters in this movie such as his son, his older self and even his daughter from 2015. Also it was amusing to see the 2015 Biff ragging on his former 1955 self for being dumb and sounding like an idiot. And also seeing the son of Biff, Griff, was a trip too. Because he's basically the same type of bully his father was in 1955, but more juiced up because of robotic implants. It was even nice to see Zemeckis do an homage to part 1 by having almost the same skateboard scene from part 1 in this movie also, but a more futuristic version of it.<br /><br />Though it used to be my favorite of the trilogy, I'm starting to lean more to part 1 being my favorite, but part 2 is definitely a close second. Once again, this movie is a classic also and I highly recommend it if you loved part 1.<br /><br />P.S. - From the first time I saw this move to right now as I type this... I want a friggin hover board!<br /><br />-----------------------<br /><br />Back to the Future: Part 3<br /><br />-Saddle up Cowboy... it's a Wild West adventure for Doc and McFly.<br /><br />As soon as Marty and Doc get ready to go back to 1985 from 1955, the Delorean is hit with a lightning bolt and sends Doc somewhere in time. As Marty is standing there in 1955, confused on what to do, a mailman comes up to him, handing him a letter addressed to him, from 1885, from Doc. The letter says that he hid the Delorean in a cave, and to use it to get back to 1985 and to not come to 1885 to rescue him. But when Marty finds out that Doc dies from a gunshot to the back, he decides to not listen to Doc and head back to 1885 to save Doc from dying. But when he arrives in 1885, he busts his fuel line, leaking out all the fuel. And in 1885, there is no gasoline. So while Doc and Marty try to figure out how to get back to 1985, they must also try and not die by the gun of Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen, the relative of Biff.<br /><br />While part 3 feels like part 1 and 2, it almost feels totally different. It being more of a western has a big hand in that also. And I love westerns, so I love part 3. Honestly in my review of part 2, I said part 1 is probably my favorite, but I really don't know. I love all 3 parts equally because even though they all have the same premise, they are all so different at the same time. In part 3, I absolutely loved the character of Buford Tannen. He was absolutely hilarious. And he really felt like he was a bad guy from back in the west. The way he talked and the way he looked. I also liked how a lot of part 2 hinted at parts of part 3 (since they were both made back to back). For instance, Marty sees a picture of his great grandfather in part 2 and he says something like "Good looking guy", but in part 3 we find out it was really Marty himself. And definitely one of my favorite parts of all 3 movies is here in this movie. The final scene with the train trying to get the Delorean to the future was done really well.<br /><br />For the final part of the trilogy, I really couldn't have asked for more. Definitely a great ending to a great trilogy that will be loved for a long time by children and adults. OWN THIS!<br /><br />P.S. - So why didn't Marty and Doc just go to the cave that Doc put the Delorean in to siphon gas from it to put it into the Delorean that needed gas instead of trying to use a train to get it to the future. DOH! =)</p></br><a href="../users/A2MG8DHACXH5MS.html">A2MG8DHACXH5MS</a><br/><p>2005 marked the 20th anniversary of the first movie in the trilogy. This collection is for die-hard fans of Back to the Future. Hard to believe the 80's now look so dated in retrospect. This is a classic tale and the movie that made Michael J. Fox a big screen star. Imagine being able to change the future and the past all with just a DeLorean.</p></br><a href="../users/ADE852UR9121C.html">ADE852UR9121C</a><br/><p>I remember first watching these movies when I was about 10 or 11, and I loved it. I finally got around to getting this boxset, and as I was watching the movies again, I realize that I enjoy them even more. And that is the kind of appeal these movies have, they offer something for everyone and are suitable for all ages. First, I will give a quick run-through of the storyline for all the movies.<br /><br />In Back To The Future: Part I, we are introduced to Marty and Doc Brown. Doc Brown invents a time machine out of a DeLorean. Marty accidentally goes back in time to 1955, and is forced to look up the Doc to fix the time machine and get him back to 1985. What follows is a hilarious take on Marty's situation where he meets his parents when they were his age, and there are an assorted array of characters, from the ultimate school bully, Biff to the over-strict discipline teacher, aptly called Mr. Strickland.<br /><br />In Back To The Future: Part II, Doc Brown comes back from the future with some disturbing news about Marty's kid. He gets Marty as well as Jennifer, and they go to the future to save Marty's kid from ending up in jail. In the process, they lose Jennifer. While Doc Brown and Marty are trying to get her back, Biff gets into the DeLorean, goes back to 1955 and does something which changes the year 1985. This forces Doc Brown and Marty to go back to 1955, and they have to prevent Biff from changing anything in the past to affect the future.<br /><br />In Back To The Future: Part III, Marty goes back to the year 1885 to save Doc Brown, who supposedly gets shot by a villain called Buford "Mad Dog" Tannen. We see the Doc falling in love with a school teacher, Clara and it is Marty that is trying to keep him clear headed. They try to fix the DeLorean to get them back to 1985.<br /><br />The thing about Back To The Future movies, is that they are just so damn entertaining. These movies are hardly serious, nor are they going to change our lives or make us look at things differently. But when you talk about silly fun...this is as good as it gets. It is such a joy watching the characters we love take on different people each installment, and making the most of it. Something that stands out in the Back To The Future series is the script. It is superb. In the first movie, we are given glimpses of how it would be like watching our parents as teens. Were they as good as they always say, or did they have mischievious streaks as well? These are the questions that the writers make us think about, and they do it with such humour and wit. The second movie is more suited for adults. It is definitely more complex, but the way the writers tackle the issues of multiple timelines and alternate realities is refreshing. It is certainly the more ambitious of the 3 movies. And finally, they went back to basics for the third and final movie. The old west is presented quite typically, but still is a delight to watch.<br /><br />The cast give fantastic performances. Because these movies do not require serious actors, they seem to just roll with it. They give very real and honest performances. Trust me, it makes the stories that much more convincing. They give us a sense of excitement and wonder at what they're going through. Everyone from Michael J. Fox to Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson to Thomas Wilson are impressive.<br /><br />In short, if you're looking for a fun adventure...something to relax to, something that is timeless, look no further...this is it. A definite classic in my opinion. At a time when creativity seems to be lacking in most movies, it's nice to be reminded how fun movies can be.</p></br><a href="../users/AOVJYIUATQKR5.html">AOVJYIUATQKR5</a><br/><p>This is one of the cleverest, family friendly movies ever made.  I give the first movie 5 stars, the second 3 stars due to confusion in the story and 4 stars to the third movie, which was more tightly written.<p>warning.  i bought the trilogy on vcd and it is a major disappointment due to quality.  Pay the extra for the DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A25AXWGBGJ5KBS.html">A25AXWGBGJ5KBS</a><br/><p>"Back To The Future" has rightly attained classic status as one of the most entertaining films from the 1980's. It was an unexpected smash the summer of it's release, and one of those movies where images and phrases become part of popular culture within a weekend.<br />I feel the most impressive achievement by the filmmakers is the perfectly balanced tone of the movie. After all, upon going back in time, Marty (Michael J. Fox) finds his own mother has "the hots" for him. High potential for creepiness, but it's handled so deftly and sweetly it works wonderfully.<p>The underlying theme, echoed often by the filmmakers on the supplements, is the realization that your parents were once teenagers. Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover draw crisp portraits of Marty's folks, filled with delightful little details.<p>Zemeckis and company also balance the "period piece" nature of the film with the "sci-fi" elements in a way that neither one overwhelms the other. They also simultaneously remember the 50's with a rosy, reverent glow while tweaking it's nose a bit.<p>Watching it again after all these years, I was amazed at how everything works, and at how well it has aged. The funny thing, is that the movie is so well done, the 80's is presented as sweetly as the 50's, now seen from the 21st century. In a goofy way, the movie is its' own time machine. It takes you right back. It's a wonderful film.<p>Now for the sequels. Reductio ad absurdum, "Number 2" is the dark, twisted flip side to the first film. It's a Gordian knot of time travel complications. There is a level of genius in having a sequel that revisits the original from a different perspective, from tone to script to even camera angles...the "perspective" is skewed.<p>"Number 3" gives Doc (Christopher Lloyd) a chance to be the center of the film, and by going further back in time, the film offers more simple, less serious options to wrapping up the three films. It's a Western, giving Fox and friends a chance to play on horses, shoot guns and lasso things.<p>While the first film is perfect on it's own, the other two are infinitely better taken as a whole rather than as separate films. They're not totally necessary, but nicely fill out a sort of "BTTF" universe.<p>Smartly packaged as an affordable three-disc set, with nifty extras and outtakes that'll leave you begging for more (there's a great "appearance" by Roger Rabbit), this is one of the safest purchases you'll make!</p></br><a href="../users/A10L8O1ZMUIMR2.html">A10L8O1ZMUIMR2</a><br/><p>The &quot;Back To The Future&quot; movies are well known by most people and are considered to be a classic. It plays not so much on going back in time to save the world, but yourself. It plays on all the things we wonder about time-travel but are never seen in any movies but these. Now to start off with, my liking for them goes in order; the first is my favorite, second is my second favorite, and third is my least favorite. The first film has a unique magic to it, and is capable of surviving the playback test. I could watch it a hundred times and not get sick of it. It's charm keeps bringing you back for more. However, I feel that the other two, mostly the third one, just drag on. The second one is helpful to answer your questions from the first, but the third is almost nonsense. But keeping the somewhat low price in mind, it's so worth it to buy this box set even if you like only the first.<p>The whole set is very nice and polished, picture and sound quality are great and make it seem like you're watching a brand new movie. There are a fair amount of extras on each disk and all are very fun to look through. I guarantee that once you buy this great box set, you will have hours of fun experiencing Marty's adventures through time!</p></br><a href="../users/AQ6SV7LDSMGBE.html">AQ6SV7LDSMGBE</a><br/><p>In response to the nay-sayers who wish to buy only the first film, I'm certain you'll see it sooner or later.  As a collection completist, I'm relieved to receive all of them at once and at a reasonable price.  The extras are superb.<p>I haven't noticed the framing problems others have mentioned, but I'll watch for them.<p>Muhammed Ali's appearance in the extras for Micheal Fox's Parkinsons fund-raiser was cute, too.  Good to see Ali again. (And fun to watch him punch out Fox.)</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Sure there have been time travel stories before but none quite like this. Suppose you could go back into the past and see your parent's yearbook in action? Suppose your mother developed a crush on you? Finally, suppose your dad was a dweeb and your mission is to somehow make him into a hero. That's what happens to Marty Mcfly (Michae J. Fox in his star making role)all within the span of a couple of days. <p>When Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd in the past and the present)creates a time machine he does it with style; Brown refashions a Delorean sports car with his flux capacitor which allows it to travel through time. It's an ironic touch given the short life the Delorean had as an auto and the futuristic touches on the car itself (i.e., the doors that open up and away from the car like wings, etc.) Brown's plan is to travel to the future but through a terrible series of events, Brown isn't sent anywhere--instead Marty Mcfly his teenaged friend flies into the past.<p>The film is a mixature of both timeless (the Reagan is President line still creates chuckles) and dated (Pepsi Free is long gone) comedic touches. Luckily, there's a visual reference to the soda earlier in the film that helps make the joke still work (if you can catch the brief reference). Steven Spielberg once referred to Back to the Future as the ultimate Leave it to Beave episode with a sci-fi twist.The script by long time collaborators Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis is packed with visual and verbal jokes that keep you on your toes. The zany direction by Robert Zemeckis is witty and manages to bring out the best comedic side of all the actors involved. It both captures the best elements of Zemeckis broad approach to comedy (as in Used Cars) and builts on that foundation with sly wit and satire (like in Forrest Gump)<p> Although it appears that Michael J. Fox's performance is little more than an extension of his persona, he actually does wonders with his role. He breathes life into a character that could have been a one-note shrill performance. The entire cast is compendable in roles that are a challenge. Lea Thompson manages to portray both the girlish charm of Marty's mom as a teenager and the resigned disappointment of her in middle age.<p>The transfers are generally very good although I noticed in the first film in particular that some of the sequences are quite grainy. I'm not sure if it was the film stock, transfer or the print but it's not all that distracting unless you watch it on a big screen television. It's note a huge problem just a blip that doesn't prevent you from enjoying the film. The second and third films look a bit better and have less grain/compression problems. Perhaps it was more noticable for me because I had previously viewed the film on laserdisc.<p>The commentary by producer/writer Bob Gale and interviews with Gale, Zemeckis, Spielberg and others are enlightening. You also have the option (like Spiderman) of allowing 150 factoids about the film to pop up throughout the feature. Watch it the first time without the facts.<p>The second film traces Marty's attempt to undo the changes in time created by Biff. Biff in the future manages to get ahold of a book that presents baseball results from the past 50 years. He goes into the past via Doc Brown's Delorean and gives it to his younger self. The result is a sleazy future dominated by Biff. Marty and Doc Brown must undo the damage and return the future back to the way it was. The plot is a bit complex compared to the first film. Marty actually goes into the past and sees himself living the first film. He has to do so, though, without altering that visit and setting the future right again. It provides great comedic fun particularly when he does go into his own future and witnesses what happens to himself because of his short temper.<p>In the final part of the trilogy, Marty goes into the past in search of Doc Brown to prevent his murder. Again, the anarchisms of the past/present/future provide considerable comic relief. Although it's not as sharp as the first film, the plot is streamlined compared to the convoulted second film. The third film works a bit better because the audience doesn't have to concentrate on the complex plot (as in the second film)and is already familair with the set up (put forth in the first film). It's not quite as imaginative or innovative as the first film and lacks the visual style of both the first and second. Nevertheless, it's fun and manages to both hold your interest and entertain you at the same time. A note of trivia about the second and third films. They were actually shot back to back to save money on the budget. This was the first film shot in that fashion and, although it's quite common place now to do this (Lord of the Rings for example), it was both quite daring and innovative at the time. Daring because if the second film tanked, Universe Zemeckis and Spielberg would have been stuck with another turkey.<p>The packaging is great with a nice little booklet that includes comments from cast and filmakers. Additionally, the extras also include outtakes, bloopers and a few surprises you'll want to find out about yourself. 5 Stars for 1, 3 1/2 stars for 2 and 4 stars for 3. The extras deserve 4 1/2 stars as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A29QA79VLQGHY6.html">A29QA79VLQGHY6</a><br/><p>Watching the trilogy back-to-back-to-back on DVD allows viewers to catch many of the quick visual references to previous and future "Future" films. Director Robert Zemeckis and writing partner Bob Gale loved tinkering with their premise, and it pays off in the attention to detail that's sure to inspire multiple DVD viewings.<p>Executive producer Gale does the heavy lifting on the DVD set's many extras, appearing throughout the featurettes and on the three films' commentaries (with fellow producer Neil Canton). Gale speaks softly, with a Ben Stein-toned delivery that won't keep anybody up late. The extras have far too much duplication. "You're probably sick of hearing us talk about these movies," he says gently as "Future III" begins. Only the obsessed will disagree.<p>Gale works hard, though, and delivers the goods for those hungry for production stories. He recalls how Universal chieftain Lew Wasserman ended a salary holdout on "Future III" in Hollywood "Godfather" style, with the balking filmmakers getting nothing extra. " 'Don't mess with Lew Wasserman' was the moral of the story," Gale remembers. Production of the second and third films overlapped, with Zemeckis editing "II" while shooting "III."<p>Zemeckis, Gale and star Michael J. Fox get in their camera time in "Making the Trilogy," a snappy DVD docu that runs as a serial across the three discs. Original making-ofs lead off each disc's extras. The first is surprisingly interesting. Zemeckis and Gale appear on a second audio commentary for each film that repurposes Q&A screenings with USC film students.<p>Fox chips in here and there, looking good. His enthusiasm level peaks as he speaks of the scene in which his Marty character invents rock 'n' roll in "Future I."<p>The set comes in widescreen and full-screen. The widescreen version shows the film as matted by the filmmakers for theatrical release (1.85.1). The full-screen shows the images as shot (about 1.35:1), so there is a bit more visual information. The otherwise informative DVD packaging doesn't cover this. Images look OK, with minor speckling. Colors seem fine for popcorn movies from the '80s.<p>The remastered 5.1 Dolby has some decent rear effects, mostly swooshes and blasts as our heroes ride their time machine, but nothing heavy. There is no DTS track.<p>Deleted scenes should interest fans, especially a dark take in which Biff Tannen's ancestor Mad Dog shoots a father in the back as his son watches. (No one should die in the series and not come back, they decided.)</p></br><a href="../users/A31I3HXMD5H1EL.html">A31I3HXMD5H1EL</a><br/><p>If there was ever a film series that was meant to be viewed together, the 'Back to the Future' trilogy is it! Delightfully madcap, the misadventures of Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox, in his signature role), and his mentor, Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd, achieving well-deserved stardom), tweak not only the time travel genre, but westerns, family comedies, rock n' roll, and Hollywood's concept of life in the future, as well, while taking viewers on an exhilarating ride!<p>Sadly, in the initial release of the 3-disc set, there were formatting problems on BTTF Part 2 and Part 3, but Universal has corrected the errors, and the entire series looks terrific, now!<p>'Back to the Future', the first of the trilogy, is the best, of course, introducing the McFly family (nerdy father Crispin Glover and repressed mother Lea Thompson, both playing characters years older than their actual ages, are terrific!), and villain Thomas F. Wilson (every kid's nightmare bully, grown up). Escaping terrorists who 'kill' Doc Brown, young Marty is launched in a souped-up DeLorean back to 1955, where he accidently disrupts history, interrupting his younger, but still nerdy father and oversexed and curious mother's falling in love (she falls for Marty, instead). Now Marty must not only return to the future to 'save' Doc Brown, but he must unite his future parents, before his family disappears, forever! (Watch for a young Billy Zane in a bit part, as one of Wilson's gang!)<p>'Back to the Future, Part II', filmed four years the original, replaces Glover (who made some insane salary demands) with Jeffrey Weissman (who isn't really seen much), and Claudia Wells (who had taken a hiatus from acting), as Marty's girlfriend, Jennifer, with Elizabeth Shue (who would achieve stardom a few years later), and picks up where the first film ends; Doc Brown recruits Marty and Jennifer to journey to 2015 to 'rescue' their future kids! The overly convoluted plot (this is the weakest of the trilogy, although the most inventive, in many ways) has the evil Biff getting hold of a sports almanac from the future, amassing a fortune, and 'punishing' the McFly family, starting back in 1955. Marty must again return to the past to straighten things out, and prevent Biff from ultimately murdering his father and marrying his mother! Then, to top things off, Doc Brown and the DeLorean disappear, thrown back to 1885, and stranding Marty in 1955!<p>'Back to the Future, Part III' is a terrific finale, as Marty, aided by 1955's Doc Brown, travels back to 1885, to rescue the 1985 version. Doc, meanwhile, falls in love with feisty school marm Mary Steenburgen, and must, with Marty's help, change history to prevent her dying, while Marty deals with Biff's evil ancestor. A climax with a time-travelling locomotive brings the trilogy to an exciting conclusion!<p>There are a LOT of extras in this DVD package, including documentaries from the initial release of the films and DVD exclusives; a in-depth interview with Michael J. Fox about his participation (On the first film, filmed simultaneously while he was starring on 'Family Ties', on TV: "I was sleeping two hours a night, but I was 22!"); a commentary track with writer/producer Bob Gale and producer Neil Canton; another audio track, featuring a live college discussion with Gale and director Robert Zemeckis; outtakes and some really hilarious bloopers; and more!<p>This is a dream presentation of a dream series, and if you haven't bought your DVD player yet, BUY one! This collection is THAT good, and VHS simply can't touch it! <p>With the 'Back to the Future' DVD Collection, to paraphrase the movies, "The Future is here!"</p></br><a href="../users/A27RJ30RN5K9MX.html">A27RJ30RN5K9MX</a><br/><p>Let's face it. Practically everyone has seen the Back to the Future films. They have become known around the world as being part of one of the greatest trilogies ever made. The films combine superior acting, action, humor, first rate special effects, an amazing overall soundtrack and an extremely interesting look at time travel. The entire cast is filled with amazing actors that include Michael J Fox, Lea Thompson, Christopher Lloyd, and Thomas F Wilson. The only dissapointment cast wise was Crispin Glover. The reason is not because of a bad performance. In fact, he was quite good as George McFly. However, he only signed on to be in the first film, which was quite a dissapointment to the fans of the trilogy. The main reason the cast did such a great job, is because they were assigned the difficult task of playing more than one character. Over the course of the three films, Michael J Fox, Lea Thompson and Thomas F Wilson played 8 different characters between the three of them.<p>The extras included in the DVD set are outstanding. There are featurettes, deleted scenes, outtakes, and much more. This really lets you see the films in a whole new light. I did have a few complaints however. As you have probably already read, the widescreen format on the second and third films is absolutely horrible. My other complaint, is that they took the &quot;To Be Continued&quot; out of the first film for some reason. While this may be a very small flaw, I was still upset because the film should be shown in its intirety. Overall, this is one of the greatest trilogies ever made in my opinion. The set is worth buying just for the films themselves. The DVD extras only make the set that much more attractive. Now despite the flaws the set has, it is definately worthy of being added to anyone's DVD collection.<p>Just in case there is anyone out there who has not seen the Back to the Future films, I will include a short synopsis of each film:<p>Back to the Future <p>The first chapter of the trilogy introduces us to Marty McFly(Michael J Fox) and his friend Emmet &quot;Doc&quot; Brown ( Christopher Lloyd)who is perceived by the town of Hill Valley as a crazy old mad scientist. Doc has discovered a way to travel through time, by building a time machine into a Delorian. Marty is accidentally sent back into the year 1955, where he must find the 1955 version of Doc to help him get home. Along the way, he meets and becomes friends with his parents(who don't know his true identity), and he also has to deal with the town bully named Biff ( Thomas F Wilson). To make matters worse, Marty's mother ( Lea Thompson)has the hots for him, and he must find a way to make her fall for his father(Crispin Glover), to insure that he is born.<p>Back to the Future II <p>The second chapter of the trilogy takes us 40 years into the future, where Marty and Doc travel to the year 2015 to insure that Marty's kids turn out alright. Along the way Marty picks up an alminac that contains the outcome of every major sporting event from 1980 to the year 2000. Unfortunately, the elderly 2015 version of Biff manages to get his hands on the alminac as well as the time machine, and delivers the alminac to himself in 1955. When Marty returns to his own time, everything is turned around, and Biff is the most powerful man in town. Now, Marty and Doc must travel back to 1955 to put things right without running into their other selves.<p>Back to the Future III<p>The third and final chapter of the trilogy takes us to the year 1885 in the Old West. Doc is accidentally sent back to the year 1885 after the Delorian is struck by lightning, which leaves Marty stranded in 1955. Once again, Marty must find the 1955 version of Doc to help him with the time machine. When Marty discovers through old records that Doc is going to be killed by a psychotic gunslinger named Mad Dog Tannen, he travels back to 1885 to prevent the tragic death from occuring. Unfortunately, back in 1885, Doc manages to meet a woman named Clara ( Mary Steenburgen) whom he falls for at first sight. This makes Doc want to stay in 1885, regardless of what happens to him.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DY46ZABF4CMQ.html">A3DY46ZABF4CMQ</a><br/><p>Finally, Universal have decided to release the long awaited DVD Boxset of the most exciting trilogy ever released since Star Wars. Back To The Future has got to be one of our modern day classics. A big piece of pop culture. Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd will always be remembered for their roles as Marty McFly and Dr. Emmet Brown.<p>This special boxset features many extras that are compiled for each part on seperate discs, including deleted scenes, a behind the scenes look at the making of Back To The Future and its sequels, bloopers (which are remarkably funny), commentary and interview with Michael J Fox, public service announcements for the fight against Parkinson's which features Michael J Fox along with Muhammed Ali, and much much more!<p>The audio quality is perfect, and the video is crisp clear.

I'm here to mention the special Hot Wheels Delorean package. The toy is pretty neat and hits all the respectable details enough for even a collector to enjoy. Just keep in mind this isn't an exclusive offer or limited edition. My four year old son got the exact same car from a $1 crate at our local Kroger. I'm kind proud he picked that car out of the dozen or so other options. Anyway you should probably look at a cheaper edition and hunt your local toy store for the car. Should save you a pretty penny.</p></br><a href="../users/A1T3O2LILVK0C4.html">A1T3O2LILVK0C4</a><br/><p>In 1985, director Robert Zemeckis (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005UEQX">Used Cars</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FO0AA6">Romancing the Stone</a>) released a film that was destined to become not only a summer hit, but also the beginning of a classic comedy trilogy. Back to the Future had it all; a great cast, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000002O4S">a brilliant soundtrack</a>, and a clever time travel story. It also didn't hurt that the film was produced by hotshot filmmaker Steven Spielberg (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VECAD0">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXC5">the Indiana Jones films</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX9Q">E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</a>) and the original story was written by Bob Gale (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783231032">1941</a>), who was first inspired by looking through his father's old high school yearbook.<br /><br />Back to the Future - 1985<br />`80s teen Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is accidentally sent back in time to the 1950s when his parents were his age. Desperate to return to the future, he looks up Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd), the eccentric inventor who would later create the time machine. But things become complicated when Marty fortuitously alters history, preventing his mother, Lorraine (Lea Thompson) from falling in love with his father, George (Crispin Glover). With Marty's very existence at stake, Doc prepares an elaborate setup that will send Marty back to the future but Marty must first unite his parents while avoiding high school bully, Biff (Thomas F. Wilson).<br /><br />Naturally after the success of Back to the Future, both Robert Zemeckis and Universal Studios wanted to make a sequel. Universal got more than they bargained for when Zemeckis offered to direct two sequels. With Back to the Future Part II, writer Bob Gale decided to tell a more complicated story that dealt with the consequences of altering the timeline. The film was unfairly criticized for its complex story and the dark vision of an alternate 1985, but it still was rewarded with commercial success and it built up anticipation for the third film. Back to the Future Part III took the characters to the Old West and returned to the more lighthearted comedy/romance of the first film, but it ended unsatisfactorily with the destruction of the time machine.<br /><br />Back to the Future Part II - 1989<br />Doc Brown returns from the future to warn Marty that his future children are in great danger. He, Marty, and Marty's girlfriend, Jennifer (Elisabeth Shue) travel from the year 1985 into the year 2015 in order to save Marty's children, Marlene and Marty Jr. (Michael J. Fox) from the corruptive influence of Biff's grandson, Griff (Thomas F. Wilson). Biff steals the time machine and travels into the past. When Marty and Doc return to 1985, they arrive in their hometown to find that it's become a haven for crime and disorder. Biff rules the town, and worse, he's married to Marty's mother. Now, Doc and Marty must travel back to 1955 to correct the timeline and restore the future to its normal state.<br /><br />Back to the Future Part III - 1990<br />After the time machine is struck by lightning and Doc is sent back in time to the year of 1885, Marty seeks the aid of Doc in the year 1955 so that he can repair the time machine. But Marty discovers that the Doc in 1885 was murdered by Biff's pugilistic ancestor, Mad Dog Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson). Marty travels back to 1885 to rescue Doc, who's living out his dream of life in the Old West. Doc's fallen in love with a schoolteacher, Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen), and Marty must now convince him to return to the future.<br /><br />The Back to the Future trilogy has become one of the most successful trilogies ever made, as well as being one of the greatest examples of time travel in films. Blessed with a brilliant ensemble cast headed by Michael J.

The accident caused an outpouring of complaints by so many fans that in 2005, Universal released a corrected version of the complete trilogy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ADUOVTY3TIRU.html">A3ADUOVTY3TIRU</a><br/><p>There is no doubt about it these were sensational movies.Michael.J.Fox and Christopher Lloyd were brilliant here.<br />Often people will tell me that the 1st one is their fav.<br />But the 2nd and 3rd are not far behind.<br />The additional features on this triology are second to none.<br />Surely everyone knows the plot.But for those who have eather been living on a different planet,or somehow havnt seen any of these,lets have a quick run through<br />Marty McFly is a school boy and his friend Doc Brown invents a time machine.He uses a Delorian which when it reaches 88 miles per hour zaps into the time of your choice.<br />Thomas.F.Wilson plays a brilliant part as the baddie called Biff.In the 2nd movie he plays Griff and in the 3rd movie he plays Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen.He was supurb in each of his characters,and in my opinion often gets forgotten as someone who<br />played their part so well.<br />Ive watched these movies countless times.They are the sort of movies you dont get sick of.<br />Michael.J.Fox's sense of humor in this triology is hillarious,but also believable.<br />You can tell how well thought out these movies were.One of the special features tells you things about the movies you never knew.<br />Anyone who likes these movies should get this.The hours of extras should keep you busy,so you can relive the magic over and over.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>First things first.<br /><br />These films were filmed in "open matte", meaning the widescreen versions are just fullscreen with black bars on the top and bottom to create an ANAMORPHIC widescreen picture (so the videophiles won't complain about having black bars on the sides of the movies).<br /><br />Basically, they took the 4:3 (fullscreen) version and just put black bars on the top and bottom, thus cutting off a lot of the picture.<br /><br />The Fullscreen versions are the REAL versions, regardless of who says what.<br /><br />There's been a debate on the BTTF.com forums of which was intended (widescreen or full). Well, widescreen would be intended for the theatres, but full is what Zemeckis intended the audience to see. He admitted this himself.<br /><br />NOW.<br /><br />Reviews of the films:<br /><br />Back to the Future -<br /><br />Whether you classify this as science fiction, comedy, or fantasy, this movie could fit all three categories. In 1985, Marty McFly's good buddy, "Doc" Emmett Brown, has a DeLorean and is building a time machine out of it. So the two meet at a mall, which was once a pine tree farm, and test it, but when Marty is chased by Libyans, he is accidentally sent back to 1955, and this is where the movie really begins. He accidentally runs into his parents and the evil Biff and his henchmen. Instead of old man George getting run over by the car, Marty does, so Lorraine falls for her own son. But Doc sees a picture of the family and it is incomplete, so he advises Marty to get his real parents together or else he will "disappear from existence." When Marty gets back to 1985, he notices a dramatic change in his parents - his dad is not a nerd and his mom actually has self esteem, as do the siblings. Now if Marty himself can quit being a slacker... What stands out is the plot and what results from it, as well as some one-liners (Great scott! by Doc, and This is heavy! by Marty). To realize the full effect of this movie, you must watch the whole trilogy, even if Future II is a little repetive, while III is better than II, but not the original, of course.<br /><br />Back to the Future Part II -<br /><br />BTTFII somehow manages to remain fresh and original. Unlike most other sequels like "Rambo: First Blood part two", the Rocky sequels, Superman sequels, and the Batman sequels, this one remains to be as good as the first one. The story can get a little predictable at times and has a few minor plot holes if you haven't seen the last film, but it gives you a few plot twists that make it interesting. Michael J. Fox is simply hilarious in this film as well as everyone else. The special effects are great too even by today's standards. Overall, this is another great sequel for its franchise.<br /><br />Back to the Future Part III -<br /><br />The cast and crew, from the last two Back to the Future movies are back to deliver another comedic performance for the entire family. What can I say about this film? The film offers everything the last two had with loveable characters, clever plot twists, and many memorable scenes. This last one is still fairly predictable and has some plot holes if you haven't seen the last two films, but the plot twists will leave you in suspense. Christopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox are brilliant in this film, so the wild west never looked like so much fun.<br /><br />Overall, the Back to the Future series is a great movie trilogy for the whole family to enjoy, and I hope you'll agree too.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />The extras include commentaries on all 3 films, deleted scenes, featurettes, outtakes, and much more behind the scenes stuff! If you own a DVD player, the Back to the Future trilogy is a must have for your DVD collection. The only minor annoyance is that they are only selling it as a set and the fact that they are trying to trick everyone into buying the cropped widescreen versions. But, the set isn't too big of a problem. Besides, you were going to get all three anyway...weren't you? :)</p></br><a href="../users/ABX7SEE84DMLU.html">ABX7SEE84DMLU</a><br/><p>Well, there are five reasons.<br /><br />1.  The screenplay's treatment of science.  As much as I like science fiction, science fiction fans have developed a jargon which has alienated normal people.  SF folks know, for example, not only what a time warp is, they also can explain the general theory of relativity which allows for such a thing.  So you have extremely involved scientific theory which must be explained to a lay audience, in such terms that they are not put to sleep.  H.G.Wells understood that, and Robert Zemeckis does, too.  So, without patronizing the audience or cheapening the literary value, the theory is developed and then illustrated in straightforward, dramatic and accessible terms.  It helps that the scientist-hero is lovable but not quite sane.<br /><br />2.  The screenplay's treatment of extremely touchy human issues.  OK, so you go back in time and your mother falls in love with you, which is punished by the extinguishment of your own existence.  Sound like lighthearted fun?  Can you only imagine what Quentin Tarantino would have done with this material?  But here, it becomes independent fuel for the plot, made "safe" by mom and son consummating their relationship, only to find that they taste funny.  Our socio-sexual mores are protected, and the universe is restored to peace and balance.  And they did it in only two shots, too!<br /><br />3. Production values. Today, we have amazing capabilities in CGA, capture technologies, and digital special effects. Back in 1985, they had pyro, models and matte photography. But hey, feel the love here: they built a town square set, meticulously remade the 1950s, and then "aged" it for it's run-down 1985 look. You feel as though you grew up there and then lived there throughout its degeneration. The sheer brilliance of the filmmaker's dedication to these premises is not an accident. Our Auteur (Zemeckis) and our Angel (Spielberg, before becoming the total gozillionaire he is today) said we'd spare no expense in creating a lovingly detailed picture of the past and the present...<br /><br />4. Our ability to identify. This is a movie about us. Most great movies are just that. We identify with the protagonist, the archetypal wise-guy American "kid," featured in American films since before Mickey Rooney. We identify with his finding his own past - thus completing a quest we can all identify with. But finally, we identify with everyone. Even the parents, who lose and then find their relationship in the present. Even the bad guy who, while not redeemed exactly, is placed into a role commensurate with his gifts. Even the scientist, who, in a wonderful moment in all screen history, expresses the Dr. Frankensteinian triumph but in a way that makes us all share his joy: "It Works!!" This, after many, many failures and disappointments, exposing him to ridicule as a "mad scientist" at worst and a moneyed loser at best. What could be more American than that?<br /><br />5. Gestalt. Call it what you want, but consider the conceptual continuity of these three movies. 1985 remained the "present" for all the films, right? Even this one and BTTF3, made some years later, preserved 1985 as the fulcrum year.<br /><br />Quick quiz: of all the eras depicted, which one was the best: 1885, 1955, 1985 or 2015? Tough question, given that there were at least three distinct 1985s, etc.<br /><br />But look: even the "best" 1985 was, in significant ways, not as good as the movie's 2015. Our predicates, then, are that obstacles can be overcome, the past reinvented as needed, and, most importantly, "the future is what you make it."<br /><br />I like this new millenium of ours - how about you??<br /><br />I've found no clearer demonstration of a fundamentally optimistic philosophy in any movie I ever saw. Even though these 3 films intentionally avoid sentimentality (all right, you could argue that), they express a relentless optimism that enables characters and, derivately, ourselves, to take charge of our situations, invent new solutions and fulfill Doc Brown's mandate.<br /><br />You cannot leave the movie without feeling more empowered about your own life. And it does not get any better than that.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZSC81MXLBELX.html">A2ZSC81MXLBELX</a><br/><p>This review refers to the Universal Complete Trilogy Widescreen Edition of "Back To The Future"........<br /><br />I could go no less than 5 stars for this fun packed edition of this already classic set. I've been a big fan of "Back to the Future" and was thrilled to recieve my DVD package.The films are a great transfer, they look and sound magnificent. The pictures are clear and sharp in the widescreen(anamorphic),with excellent color as well.As for myself, I barely noticed that the specs may have been off. If those are important to you, you may want to read some of the other reviews here. The sound in 5.1 Dolby Surround(English and French) is all encompassing.There's enough "extras" to keep you busy all weekend!(great excuse not to do anything else) Included you will find, "The Making Of.." in three parts, one on each disc, there's some great question answer sessions from students at USC film school with Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale(you can listen to this throughout the films if you choose). You can also opt for the feature length commentary, see deleted scenes(that may answer some questions for you), wonderfully funny outtakes and music videos by Huey Lewis and ZZ Top. There is much more more, each disc has it's own "special features" to peruse.There are captions in English and subtitles in Spanish as well. If all the info on the discs is not enough there's also a booklet with some production notes that comes with it. The overall package is one of the best I've ever seen. THIS is one where the "special features" are really appreciated.<br /><br />The "Back to the Future Trilogy" has everything that makes a film a classic. The stories have Action, Comedy, Sci-Fi, Romance,Thrills, and even some Western adventure. All of which will sweep you away to the past, the future,the present and back again. It's a story for the whole family to enjoy together.(There is some mild language and mild violence).The filming and special effects are incredible, and the score(Alan Silvestri) and soundtrack unforgettable.The story is one for the ages. For those who are new to the world here's a little background of the entire trilogy......<br /><br />Marty McFly, is a 17 yr old high school student, who comes from a long line of "slackers".His friend,Doc Brown(Christopher Lloyd), an eccentric scientist has built a time machine, out of a DeLorean, and oops, Marty accidently takes a trip back to 1955 and runs into his own parents as high school students.He must find Doc as he is the only one who may be able to help Marty get "Back to the Future".The problem is that getting him back will take some time, and by running into his parents, he has messed with the "space-time continuim" and has threatened his very own existence.He must make things right before he can go back!<br /><br />In part 2, Marty must travel 30 years ahead this time, to straighten his life out, which has been complicated by his nemisis,Biff(Thomas E. Wilson).Once again he is beset with the problem of history being rewritten due to his interference.He and Doc must find the exact moment on the time line that made life different for all around them. They travel several times through time and with the great camera work we get to see future Marty and past Marty in the same shot...It is important though, that Past Marty and Future Marty never meet!You will aslo see Old Biff meet Young Biff which is an amazing scene!<br /><br />Then in part 3, travel back 100 years to the old west. Marty dons a spiffy cowboy outfit, and must go back and save Doc from disaster this time. The problem in this time era, is more than just the gunslingers, nothing's been invented yet to help them with parts they need to repair the time machine.  Will they ever get back? Will life ever be normal again. You'll have a great TIME finding out!<br /><br />Great acting including Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson, and Mary Steenburgen add to the greatness of these films and superb direction and attention to every detail by Robert Zemeckis makes this a heck of a ride for all! Check out all the details in every era, it's amazing, and each time you watch you'll discover some new little nuance, you may not have caught before!<br /><br />Have a little time on your hands?...This is a great package to add to your DVD collection....Have Fun....Laurie<br /><br />also recommended for more fun:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FOPPEW">Romancing the Stone / Jewel of the Nile</a><br /><br />more time travel stuff: for reading - IF I NEVER GET BACK.

Formatted to fit your screen.<br />BACK TO THE FUTURE (1985)<br />  Eric Stoltz was filming his scenes at Puente Hills Mall for "Back To The Future", however it just wasn't working out right. Stoltz was replaced.<br />  Enter Michael J. Fox who won the part to play "Marty McFly". He was working on the "Family Ties" tv series at the time and stayed up all night to work on the Mall parking lot scene with Christopher Lloyd.<br />  "Back to the Future" was released July 3, 1985 and the story begins on October 26, 1985.<br />  Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is a high school student who helps Dr. Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) take care of his house while the doctor is away.  That night, he must meet Doc at the Twin Pines Mall. With a DeLorean automobile turned into a time machine, Doc explains to Marty he is going 25 years into the future (2010). When the Libyans find Doc and shoot at him, Marty escapes in the time machine and ends up in the past, November 5, 1955 in Hill Valley at the exact spot.<br />  There he meets his own father (Crispin Glover) and his mother (Lea Thompson) who are teenagers.<br />  Like "Star Trek", you are not suppose to alter the past in anyway, but in Marty's case, he must find Doc in 1955 to help him with a time machine and get his mother and father to kiss at the dance, so Marty can exist and get back to 1985.<br />  Very cute movie and a lot of fun to watch.<br /><br />Also in the cast: Marc McClure, Wendie Jo Sperber, Thomas F. Wilson, Clauia Wells, Deborah Harmon, George DiCenzo, James Tolkan, Jeffery Jay Cohen, Casey Siemaszko, Billy Zane, Elsa Raven, Jason Hervey.<br /><br />Note: The Puente Hills Mall is known as "Twin Pine Mall" and later "Lone Pine Mall". The mall today still exists in City of Industry, California, although it has changed businesss and re-construction over the years.<br /><br />Running Time: 1:55 rated PG.<br />______________________________________________________________<br />  BACK TO THE FUTURE, PART II (1989)<br /><br />When Marty came back to 1985, not everything was quite right. Because Marty interferred in the past with Biff almost sexually assaulting his mother and his father stopping Biff and how his mother and father finally connected, the present 1985 is not how it should be.<br />  So Doc returns in the DeLorean time machine to pick up Marty and Jennifer because their kids in the future, October 21, 2015, are not right either.  However, when Marty runs into his son on the square, buys an almanac which Old Biff gets a hold of and then Biff takes the DeLorean time machine for a quick spin to who knows where, it alters 1985 once again.<br />  While Hill Valley and the McFly family is in dispair, Biff is all-powerful rich.  Doc and Marty must go back to November 5, 1955 and make things right again and not run into themselves or let themselves see them.<br /><br />Returning cast: Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilon, Casey Siemaszko, Jeffrey J. Cohen, Billy Zane, Buck Flower.<br /><br />Also in the cast: Elisabeth Shue, Charles Fleischer, Darlene Vogel, Jason Scott Lee, Elijah Wood, Flea, James Ishida.<br /><br />Running Time: 1:47  Rated PG<br />________________________________________________________________<br />BACK TO THE FUTURE, PART III (1990)<br /><br />  When lightning struck the DeLorean time machine, it disappeared, but now that 1955 and 1985 have been corrected, Marty is still stuck in 1955 and a 70 year old letter delivered by Western Union to Marty says Doc is now in the Old West 1885.<br />  Not to worry, the DeLorean has been in an old mining tunnel for 70 days waiting for 1985 Marty and 1955 Doc.<br />  Another mistake: Dr. Emmett Brown died one week after writing the letter to Marty in 1885. He was shot by "Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen".<br />  marty goes back to the Old West, Hill Valley, September 2, 1885, to try and bring back 1985 Doc, so he can exsist in the future.<br />  Marty meets his ancestors, the McFly's in the Old West.<br /><br />Returning Cast: Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Thomas F. Wilson, James Tolkan, Marc McClure, Wendie Jo Sperber, Flea, ZZ Top.<br /><br />Also in the cast: Mary Steenburgen, Matt Clark, Richard Dysart, Pat Buttram, Harry Carrey Jr, Dub Taylor.<br /><br />  Running Time: 1 hr. 58 min. Rated PG.<br /><br /> Western location filmed in Sonora County, California and Jamestown, California.  It was destroyed in 1996 by fire by a bolt of lightning.<br /><br />All three movies are here and all 3 discs contain interesting featurettes, behind-the-scenes, deleted scenes, outtakes, audio commentaries and a Bonus Feature: Animated Anecdotes that when turned "on", during playback of the film, you will get some interesting facts.<br /><br />Reunions:  Christopher Lloyd played "Doc" in the Universal Studios attraction ride, "Back To The Future...The Ride" in 1990.<br /><br />In 1991, Michael J. Fox was diagnosed with young-onset Parkinson Disease.<br /><br />Christopher Lloyd appears as "Doc" and Tom Wilson and Mary Steenburgen lent their voice for the CBS animated series, "Back To The Future"(1991-93).<br />  Christopher Lloyd and Elizabeth Shue appeared in Twenty Bucks (1993).<br /><br />  Christopher Llyod appeared as a gust with Michael J. Fox in "Spin City" tv series, February 1999.<br /><br />January 2007, Christopher Lloyd appears as "Doctor Emmett Brown" in new footage with old original "Back To The Future,Part II" footage for a DirecTV commercial.<br /><br />  There were rumors years ago that they might do another "Back To The Future" movie, but Michael J. Fox said he would not do it.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>this set contains three of michael j. foxx's & Christopher Lloyd's greates movies they made. the three back to the future movies are entertaining beyond anything. they all are great movies. they all are must sees.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>I think this is the way to buy this set.  The widescreen version originally had a problem with the last two movies, and I wouldn't get that until I knew for sure it was fixed.  Besides, since these are movies kids will appreciate most, the full screen versions tend to be what kids like (even though I always prefer widescreen).<br /><br />What I discovered is that my younger children did not know these movies.  I wondered if there being twenty years old would keep them from enjoying them.  I shouldn't have worried.  They enjoyed them immensely.  There were some cultural references that they did not get until I explained them (more from the 50s than the 80s), but that helped them gain some perspective on how culture changes over time.<br /><br />Unlike "The Lord of the Rings", this was never meant to be series of movies.  However, the huge global success of the first film led to the other two.  One evidence that a sequel was never planned is discussed in one of the extras.  It was pointed out that if they were setting up a sequel in the last scene of the first film, they would not have brought Marty's girlfriend in the car.  Having her there created tremendous problems in the second film, as you know if you have seen that film.<br /><br />The first film was inspired by the notion of a teenager discovering that his parents were once his age.  The time travel is the means to make that discover happen.  While the danger of changing the future is always there, it doesn't always have to be for the worse.  It sets up some very interesting notions about time travel, but it isn't really a movie about that or special effects.  It is about growing up in whatever time one lives and finding a deeper connection with one's parents and their lives.<br /><br />The second film begins in the future (building on the ending of the first film).  Because of something Marty was thinking about doing there and Biff acts on, the whole of history is changed again, and this time for the worse.  Doc Brown and Marty have to go back and prevent that change from occurring.  This leads to some very complex plotting because we have Marty's parents living their lives, Marty from the first film doing his thing, and now Marty from the second film coming back there to try and undo what Biff from the future has set in motion.  We learn from the extras about how hard these shots were to accomplish using the new Vistaglide from ILM.  Nowadays, it would be easy in digital, but unavailable in 1988.<br /><br />The third film was shot while the second film was in editing.  Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) is the romantic lead in this film!  It is set in the old west.  At the end of the second film the flying time machine is struck by lightening and disappears.  Moments afterward a car drives up from Western Union delivering a letter they had on file for seventy years.  Brown explains to Marty that he is happy in the past and to not come for him, but tells him how he can get home to his time in 1985.  But Marty learns that Brown was murdered shortly after the letter was written and is determined to go back and get him.<br /><br />The problem is how to get from 1885 to 1995 without any gasoline to get the car up to 88 mph and how to get there before Doc is killed.  Do they make it?<br /><br />The extras are interesting and useful in understanding the making of the films.  There is commentary that you can listen to for all three films as well as short documentaries, some deleted scenes, and a few outtakes.<br /><br />Buying the movies as a trilogy this way is quite affordable and the extras make it an even better buy.<br /><br />Recommended!  However, beware that in the mid 1980s that most of the successful teen films were "R" rated, so the studios made sure there was some swearing (mostly the SH-word) to make it a bit more "mature".  It kind of sounds out of place today - which would likely have WORSE language.  These films are rated "PG" and that seems right.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K31NF81TS0CO.html">A1K31NF81TS0CO</a><br/><p>Back to the Future is one of my favorite all time Series of all times.  I really love this set of movies and have fond memories of seeing all three of these movies on the bigscreen during my adolescent days.<br /><br />I really like how all three movies are tied together.  For all intents and purposes, this really is a 3 part Mini-Series, which just happen to be put out as three movies.<br /><br />It is one of the only movies I can remember which offered a "cliff-hanger" at the end of each film (parts 1 and 2).  Part one's cliff hanger being Doc returning from the future with bad news about Marty McFly's future kids, and part two's cliffhanger being the Western Union Message delivery service giving Marty the message from Doc, that he is still alive, in the pouring rain.<br /><br />Also, to the best of my knowledge, it is the only movie, which included "previews" for the next movie (part 3) at the end of the prior movie (part 2.)  When I saw this, I knew right away they had already filmed most of the 3rd in the series. I can't recall if they show this on the DVD. I'm pretty sure they don't, but they definitly showed it in the theater.<br /><br />I liked how Michael J. Fox (as well as the Biff character) played several parts, playing his grandfather, as well as his daughter, in part 2.  It certainly wasn't "Eddie Murphe" character acting genius, but it was good comedy relief, within the comedy.  Very funny.<br /><br />I would like to know why the girlfriend part was replaced by Elisabeth Shue.  While Elisabeth Shue does a much better job in the part, it was quite jarring to see this part replaced, and threw off the momentum of the movie ever so slightly.  They could have at least made her hair dark?  Other than that, no complaints.<br /><br />Another fact that I don't see mentioned very often, is that Crispin Glover did not appear in Parts 2 or 3, except for repeated film sequences from part 1.  Another actor played the part of Marty McFly's father in parts II and III.  Just another tidbit of trivia for you BTTF junkies.<br /><br />When I first saw this movie, I remember thinking: there was no American town such as that one.  No small town has a Malt Shop in the "downtown area" for example.  Well, I just recently moved to a small Northern California town, and it really reminds me of the town featured in this movie.<br /><br />MC White says: Check it out!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1VCLTAGM5RLND.html">A1VCLTAGM5RLND</a><br/><p>Marty is a teenage boy who hangs out with this guy who is a doctor name Dr. Brown he invented this time machine which is a car also while Marty was tape recording Dr. Brown they got interupted by some terrorist trying to kill Brown Marty too but he got in the time machine it had setted to the year 1955 which Marty went through now he has to fine Dr. Brown in the past to fix the time machine that he didn't create yet.

I held off purchasing it as I was only ever a fan of the first one.  Admittingly, the first one was available separately (and still is) in Australia but has a hefty price tag.<br /><br />About two months ago, they re-released BTTF Parts 1,2,3 in Australia in a brand new beautiful 4 disc box set.  This time with all the same features as before, but with an additional disc with more extras for each film. The bottom line is the Aussie edition now matches the US edition.  The decision to buy has been a no brainer now, and works out cheaper than purchasing the first one.  I still just prefer the first film, but I practically get the other two for nothing.  THe additional disc of extras, is not bad at all.  Finally we get the Huey Lewis video for "Power of Love" even though they have put it against Part 2's features in error.  As we all know, this song is from the first part.  Also included is the special with Kirk cameron which is very enjoyable.<br /><br />So looking at the three films, I think may of us agree that Part 2 and 3 failed somewhat. It's always hard to beat an original.  Part 2 was a flop somewhat back at the cinemas in 1989.  I remember when we walked out of the cinema, there were not many good responses.  AS for Part 3, it was set in western times and if this kind of setting isn't your cup of tea, then it's not going to pull you in.  It also flopped at the movies.<br /><br />Sit back and watch the Part 1 (skip the others). It just gets better with every viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1.html">A2QH5NMHW1KTJ1</a><br/><p>Finally all 3 back to the futures on one amazing collection. All three movies are great. They are one of the best movies of the 80's. And even of all time. Back to the Future Part 1 is about a boy named &quot;Mardy&quot; who travels back in time to 1955. He runs into his mother, which screws his mother and father relation ships. He needs help from his scientist friend named &quot;Dock&quot;. If you have the collection without the V2 on the back. The first film is not out of the frame. Only on the 2nd and 3rd movie. 8 deleted scences, behind the scense, outtakes and much more!<p>Back to the Future part 2 takes place where Back to the Future left off. Mardy and his girlfriend Jennifer need to visit the future to help their children. Then Biff (Mardys Bully) old self, becuase you see when Mardy and Dock went to the future, Mardy picked up a magizine about 50 years of sports of who wins, which Mardy can then make a few extra bucks. Dock throws away the magazine then old Biff gets the magizine and travels back to give it to his young self. Which Biff then becomes a billionare. There are 7 deleted scences with optional commentary. Behind the scenes and outtakes and much more. <p>The third and final installment of the saga takes place in the old west. You see Dock travels back in time to be left alone, but then Mardy discovers his grave, and then travels back into time to save Dock. Dock then saves a scientist who was suppose to<br />die jumping off a cliff. It is a great and final ending for the saga. It includes only 2 deleted scences, outtakes, behind the scenes and more. Make sure when you buy this dvd it has a V2 on the back. If it doesnt you can call the company and they'll ship you new dvds. If you dont know what I'm talking is about is because they mest up on the framing on Back to the Future part 2 and 3. A must to buy if your a huge fan of the movies!!!</p></br><a href="../users/AUUH6Z8MSGGF.html">AUUH6Z8MSGGF</a><br/><p>3 Blu-ray Discs, 3 Digital Copy Discs, released October 26, 2010<br /><br />The "Back to the Future" trilogy of movies was directed by Robert Zemeckis and written and directed by Zemeckis with Bob Gale. It was produced by Steven Spielberg and along with the first movie inspiring a sequel split up into two movies, an animated series, and a Universal Studios ride (which can be watched as an extra in this set!).<br /><br />Michael J. Fox played Marty McFly, a high schooler with a girlfriend named Jennifer played by Claudia Wells and a family that is less than successful. Marty is friends with a scientist, Dr. Emmett Brown played by Christopher Lloyd who has invented time travel with the use of a DeLorean! Marty accidentally goes back in time thirty years and runs into his future parents played by Lea Thompson and Crispin Glover as high schoolers and almost screws up them meeting and getting together. In the first film, he has to find a way to set things straight for history while helping his dad face a bully named Biff played by Thomas F. Wilson and get back to the future.<br /><br />In the second movie, Marty, Jennifer, and the Doc go to the future to the year 2015 where there are flying cars and other weird stuff to prevent Marty and Jennifer's son from making a big mistake. Michael J. Fox plays Marty, future Marty, Marty's son, and Marty's daughter. Most other cast members returned except for Crispin Glover whose demands were too high for another film and he was recast by Jeffrey Weissman and Jennifer Parker was recast with Elisabeth Shue due to Claudia Wells having personal family problems and dropping out of acting for a while. The main conflict is that future Biff finds out about the time machine and takes a sports almanac back to his past self to become a millionaire in 1985 when Marty, Jennifer, and the Doc return to it. After facing an "It's a Wonderful Life" Pottersville horror scenario with Biff, Marty and the Doc go back to 1955 again to set things right.<br /><br />In the third movie, Doc is accidentally sent to 1885 and Marty goes back to the old west to rescue him. He meets Irish ancestors and ends up in a showdown with Mad Dog Tannen (another incarnation of Biff because no one in the town of Hill Valley ever leaves). This one just feels like an excuse to make a fun western, but it also lets Doc Brown have a love story with Clara played by Mary Steenburgen.<br /><br />This is a classic, iconic movie series. Clearly, the first movie is the best because it is the most relatable, wanting to see your parents at your age and the charming story that goes with it and how it all magically ties together. Even though the other two movies were well thought out and planned for elements to tie in, it was never quite as special. It is a little more forced and the subplot of Marty never being able to react well to someone calling him "chicken" (or "yellow" in the third film) seemed more immature than I thought Marty was portrayed in the first film. The original "Back to the Future" is arguably one of the most memorable and influential movies of the last 25 years and is always a feel-good one to watch.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />There are three parts of a six part series on the making of the Back to the Future trilogy. You learn soooo much about the process, casting, and what it was like with Michael J. Fox's schedule recording for television during the day and for the movies at night and getting very little sleep. It is fascinating to learn how the story came together by putting events on index cards to make sure everything tied together smoothly. There are bunches of deleted scenes that mostly gave unnecessary exposition and extra jokes that took up more time than needed.<br /><br />Beyond those features are archival featurettes: On Disc One, "The Making of Back to the Future", Making the Trilogy: Chapter One, and "Back to the Future" Night where Leslie Nielsen hosts a playing of the movie on TV with interludes about how the film was made and preview footage of the sequel AND the Huey Lewis and the News "Power of Love" Music Video. On Disc Two, there is "The Making of Back to the Future Part II and Making the Trilogy: Chapter Two. On Disc Three is "The Making of Back to the Future Part III", "Making the Trilogy: Chapter Three", "The Secrets of the Back to the Future Trilogy", the music video "Doubleback" by ZZ Top who appear in the film, and Back to the Future: The Ride that you can watch.<br /><br />The Q&A with Michael J. Fox goes over some of the information already covered in the Making Of Series, but fills in a lot of blanks about makeup, crew, working with the car, etc. Every answer is set up with a visual zooming in and then zooming out which gets jarring when you hit "play all", and otherwise is a great feature on this set. For audio extras, you can listen to Q&A commentary with director/writer Robert Zemeckis and producer/writer Bob Gale on all three films. It is one session broken up into three parts, but they are not feature-length commentaries. They go more into detail about why certain actors were recast and how stories came about and situations with producers, etc. There is also feature commentary with producers Bob Gale and Neil Canton on all three films.<br /><br />In the Behind the Scenes feature on Disc One, you can watch original make-up tests, outtakes, photo galleries, and watch the storyboards version of the nuclear power plant scene that was cut in favor of the watch tower story with and without producer commentary. The deleted scenes involve embellishing story to emphasize ideas we already know (Marty's dad is a loser, etc.) as well as "showstoppers" which stop the movie to have some jokes. On Disc Two, there are outtakes, production design, storyboarding, designing the DeLorean, designing Time Travel, a Hoverboard test, evolution of the visual effects shots, and photo galleries. On Disc Three, you can watch more outtakes, designing the town of Hill Valley, designing the campaign, and photo galleries.</p></br><a href="../users/A3HQXFLZ6WI70Q.html">A3HQXFLZ6WI70Q</a><br/><p>After 25 years, the movie still looks new and awesome. The bluray video and audio is unbelievable, as if the movie was just made recently. I just watched part 1 and now going through the extra stuff and the extra stuff is like more than 3 hours. Damn. Next stop, part 2. MUST BUY. REALLY. If only they made movies like this now.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO.html">A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO</a><br/><p>Universal certainly has done it up right in re-releasing the Back to the Future franchise as they have done this time around.This four disc set comes with a remastered Back to the Future(July/85),Back to the Future 2(Nov/89),Back to the Future 3(May/90) and a special features fourth disc,but more on that later.<br />I usually go into plot summaries but by now these legendary films' plots are well known by most so I'll just skim the surface.All the film's two main stars are Michael Fox as Marty McFly and Christopher Lloyd as "Doc"or Professor Brown.The first film introduces us to the BTTF world as Marty works part time helping Doc clean his work and experimental environment.One day the Doc has plans to test his theory of time travel using a Delorean car.The plutonium which powers the flux capacitor which powers the car was stolen and the Doc gets killed before he can go.This forces Marty to drive it and he goes back to 1955.He finds and meets his parents and he also meets and convinces the younger Doc to help get him back to 1985.Back in 1985 he prevents the Doc from getting killed,but Marty soon realizes they have changed time somehow,as things are quite different at home.While he's taking this in the Doc appears from the future and whisks Marty back with him to prevent a tragedy from happening involving Marty himself.<br />In the second film we find the Doc and Marty trying to prevent Marty's future son from being arrested.Marty poses as his son and gets the job done.However Biff,Marty's nemesis from the first movie,is now rich and famous and married to his mother.It seems the 1985 Biff has given a sports book to his younger self,who has bet on every event in the book and racked up alot of money in the process.In order to correct this they travel back to 1955 to retrieve the book.When they try and leave together the Delorean(driven by Doc)is struck in mid air by lightning and disappears.Moments pass when he is approached by a courier who gives Marty a 70 year old letter.It is from the Doc in 1885.Marty goes back to the 1955 Doc for help.<br />The last Future involves the year 1885 of course.Marty and Doc in 1955 use the info in the 70 year old letter to locate and repair the Delorean.Marty returns to 1885 to retrieve the Doc,but knowing the Doc will be killed if he doesn't get to him in time.Marty manages to circumvent things but the Doc falls in love and will eventually marry and have children(there would be no future Docs without this happening!).Along with this is the problem of getting the car up to speed to return in time to 1985.The Doc determines the only solution to be to push the car up to speed via a train.This they do in a harrowing running battle with Biffs' own ancestor.As they dematerialize from 1885 to 1985 onto the rail tracks which still run on the same spot,he barely gets out before the car is demolished by a modern train.There will certainly be no more time traveling for Marty or Doc.Moments later the Doc from 1885 appears in a train hovering over the ground just to let Marty know all is well and to leave him a picture of he and his family.The film ends as we see the Doc roar back to....?<br />Imaginative,well written and smart these films will leave you on the edge of your seats from start to finish.The plots will also sometimes leave your head spinning as you try to keep up with the changing time lines and whether it all jives or not.The supporting cast is wonderful throughout and the two main stars give excellent and unforgettable performances.As if a remastering of the films wasn't enough,they have added a fourth disc into the mix filled with special features.There is a six part documentary on the film,deleted scenes,several featurettes,the Power of Love music vid,audio commentaries with each film,a look at the Universal studio theme park BTTF ride,and more.<br />Technically each film is in its a/r of 1:85:1 and the sound and picture have never looked better than this.<br />If you have fond memories of the BTTF franchise,fasten your Delorean seat belts for this four DVD set.The films sparkle like never before as you re-discover this wonderful set of flicks all over again.Highly recommended.</p></br><a

Fox and Christopher Lloyd star in this sci-fi adventure<br />trilogy directed by Robert Zemeckis. This classic trilogy focuses<br />on Marty McFly and Dr. Emmett Brown's time traveling adventures.<br />I've always loved these films and glad to have them together on<br />dvd. All 3 films have nice picture and sound plus amazing extras.<br />I highly recommend this set because it's one of the best movie<br />trilogies.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>This trilogy tells the story of Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Doc Brown's (Christopher Lloyd) adventures through time in a time machine of Doc's invention.  The first film is the best; it has more heart than the others as Marty plays Cupid in the 50s to make sure that his parents fall in love and marry the way they are meant to.  The second film relies more on zaniness as our two heroes rush breathlessly between the past and future trying to correct paradoxes of their own making.  The final film is a let-down; there is some time travel business at the beginning before the story settles down to a standard Western comedy with all of the stereotypical elements.  Strengths of the trilogy include the performances of Fox and Lloyd, lots of complex fun with the time stream, and the many inventive ways that the supporting cast is included.  A weakness is its tendency to go for the easy joke every time, even at the cost of making our hero seem somewhat dim-witted, such as Fox ordering a Pepsi Free in the 50s or ice water in an Old West saloon, hollering in panic like a cartoon character, or flying into uncontrollable rages at the suggestion that he is a coward.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JZ5L52FM318H.html">A3JZ5L52FM318H</a><br/><p>The films:<br /><br />Definitely one of the most fun film series of the 1980s and early 90s, BTTF really shines. The writing is quite clever when compared to other big-budget tentpole flicks. The ties between the three movies are a lot of fun to notice. Although part 1 is definitely the best of the three, parts 2 and 3 do not drop off too much in quality. Michael J. Fox delivers a good performance, definitely in keeping with the 1980s "slacker antihero" archetype. Christopher Lloyd is also quite good as Doc Brown.<br /><br />Part 2 is a lot of fun, naturally, because it gives us a future as envisioned in the late 1980s. But its second half, which returns to 1955, is perhaps even more clever than the first movie's portrayal, because of how it works to show the same scenes from different angles and points of view.<br /><br />Part 3 is tonally quite different than the first two, and a good portion of its emotional investment hinges on Doc Brown's romance with Clara, played by Mary Steenburgen. Their on-screen chemistry is not exactly incendiary, and thus their segments drag a bit.<br /><br />Serious sci-fi fanatics will find inconsistencies to nit-pick. I certainly noticed some. The portrayal of timeline changes and potential paradoxes are rather mind-boggling, and one gets the impression that the writers resolved to not try *too* hard to create a consistent methodology for the changes. The overall moral to the story is a bit cliche (don't succumb to peer pressure), whereas a deeper ethical investigation of time travel (seems pretty nasty to relegate Biff and his progeny to second-class citizen status merely in order to boost your own family's fortunes) might have been more interesting. But you'll be having so much fun a long the way, that deeper questions such as these tend only to occur a bit later.<br /><br />Any way you slice it, these movies are fun enough to keep the younger set intrigued, and smart enough to satisfy a more mature audience.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray:<br /><br />Let me get this out of the way - this packaging stinks. Definitely among the worst box set packaging I've seen. We get six discs packaged in a tri-fold cardboard digipak with no hubs - the discs are held in, on top of each other, by one of the most irritating pieces of plastic ever - you cannot lift these out, you must press and slide the discs in order to avoid bending them precariously against the hard plastic rim of the digipak. Unbelievably dumb. Add to that a totally superfluous cardboard case, which only repeats the box copy contained within, and doesn't even hold the innards secure when lifting. A complete and utter failure, on all counts. I wish companies wouldn't keep trying to reinvent the wheel with these sets. Just put some hubbed "pages" on a hinge, for crying out loud.<br /><br />Anyway, the 1080p, 1.85:1 film transfers are nice, especially when considering the era in which these movies were filmed. Compared to films of a similar vintage (such as Star Trek 2-4, Goodfellas, and Batman), these transfers show a good amount of detail and not a terrible amount of noise reduction and edge enhancement (see: Predator). If grain was aggressively reduced on these films, it is not noticeable. They are a definite upgrade over DVD-quality material. The video will not blow you away when compared to a newly-minted transfer of a 2009 or 2010 film. But let's compare apples to apples - these are really good transfers of 80s material. The DTS-HD sound also does a good job, with decent separation of channels, clear dialogue, and some decent bass.<br /><br />The extras are good, with commentaries, several new HD making-of and interview features, and plenty of legacy SD features from previous releases. I do wish we could have had Fox's retrospective interview condensed into one feature instead of split into a dozen snippets per disc. Also featured are the apparently obligatory (and utterly wasteful in my book) digital copies for those of you who wish to watch these movies on a 2-inch screen in the car. Yawn.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />Despite the overpoweringly dumb packaging, this set is a definite recommendation. It is a good set of family films (there is some mild swearing, but very little sex or violence) that will entertain both kids and adults. The a/v quality is more than acceptable for a high definition release of 1980s films. The extras are comprehensive and entertaining. The price point on Amazon is quite sound for a catalog release.<br /><br />In short, if you like these movies at all, this is a very good buy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ.html">A3IDMLOWLHWNDJ</a><br/><p>The third most requested DVD title, the "Back To The Future" trilogy, finally made its DVD debut in the fall of 2002 (for the curious, "Indiana Jones" was number two & the original "Star Wars" trilogy was number one).<br /><br />I give the "Back To The Future" trilogy an overall rating of four stars (I reviewed each film seperately. check my reviews for more details) & its great to finally have them in the DVD collection, but, the DVD set is technically a mixed bag.<br /><br />When "Universal" first starting releasing their films in the DVD format, their home video division had originally slated "Back To The Future" as their first big DVD title release, dating all the way back to 1998, but, kept holding back the release date for unspecified reasons.<br /><br />The "Back To The Future" trilogy set is a decent release, with all three films "remastered" (I use the term loosely) with DVD special features on each disc for each film, including deleted scenes, documetaries on the making of each film, & trailers w/ applicable music videos (The Power Of Love & Doubleback). The audio is 5.1 Dolby Digital w/ optional commentary from writer Bob Gale.<br /><br />What makes owning the set is the special features. Bob Gale lends a lot of insight into the making of all three films from the outline stage all the way to how he is still amazed at the popularity of the films after all these years. The deleted scenes & outakes are what fans have been screaming for and are all here in the set (although there is no raw footage of Eric Stoltz from the original "Back To The Future").<br /><br />Since its from "Universal" the set is marred with a few setbacks (I don't consider the films to be remastered at all & should be THX certified in future releases. I doubt that will happen).<br /><br />One setback is there is some considerable grain & dirt in the first film. The other problem is the audio to the original "Back To The Future". The other two films are fine, but, with the first film, I found some audio noise in certain scenes. A great example is the scene near the end of the film when Marty wakes up, just back from the past, & heads into the living room to see his brother & sister sitting at the dinner table eating breakfast. I have a 700 hundred watt Yamaha Dolby Digital reciever & I could hear the background hiss so much that it was too noticable & distracting (it seems that all films that are pre-Dolby Digital era have this noise, to a certain extent). I thought it might be the disc itself, but, it was actually the film.<br /><br />The other problem is with the second & third films. This has to do with the notorious discovery that these films were pressed on DVD with the films presented slightly out of frame. This is piss poor studio production at its finest and continues with "Universal" to this day (another example is the new "Jaws" DVD release). I'm not to sure if the studio is still swapping the defective discs for the correct ones, but, you should inquire with the studio before any attempt is made. With "Universal" replacing the old defective sets with new ones its pretty much a crap shoot on which version you'll wind up with. Its been said you can tell the difference if you look on the barcode on the package back. It should say "V2" underneath the barcode. Don't hold your breath, though. I have still yet to see the corrected versions.<br /><br />The "Back To The Future" saga is the best time-travel trilogy in modernday film, sadly the way this DVD release has been handled "Universal" doesn't think so. With this set currently discontinued, I hope "Universal" will get the kinks out of "Future's" future releases. Only time will tell.</p></br><a href="../users/A5QE86H97FDJA.html">A5QE86H97FDJA</a><br/><p>The first film was fun because of its' inventiveness but the second film was a wild brilliant ride but it was darker and disturbing. By the the third film, you were bored with the whole idea and it was just too silly to waste any time watching. Well, what the heck, watch them all in sequence but be sure your kids are older because the 2nd film is too upsetting for smaller kids.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HX00DL0SZM1G.html">A1HX00DL0SZM1G</a><br/><p>Ever since the DVD format was launched in the early months of 1997 there have been movies that have been among the most requested, the Holy Grails of DVD if you like. Initially these included such titles as BRAVEHEART (in 1999 a website was launched with the sole purpose of persuading Paramount to release the Oscar winner on the small shiny discs) before the mountain relented and released the epic in 2000. The same was true with WHERE EAGLES DARE, which went through many twists and turns (including a confusion at the studio level over rights) before finally emerging on the format from Warner in 2003.<br /><br />One of the most often requested titles in those early days of DVD was the Steven Spielberg produced BACK TO THE FUTURE trilogy and, after several false starts, it eventually made its triumphant arrival in the latter half of 2002, going on to be one of the biggest sellers of that holiday season.<br /><br />Released theatrically from 1985 to 1990 (with episodes 2 & 3 filmed back-to-back) the BACK TO THE FUTURE movies were among the most popular movies to come out of American cinema in the 1980s.<br /><br />With ingenious scripts that were pure brilliance, the cast and crew were obviously having a great deal of fun filming these three movies and it shows on the screen. The humor is infectious and the subtle (and sometimes not so subtle) time travel references are definite highlights in these light hearted science fiction classics.<br /><br />"Back to the Future" featured a great cast from a youthful Micheal J. Fox, to a zany Christopher Lloyd and a gorgeous, beautiful and sexy Lea Thompson.<br /><br />The movies on this set come well recommended, however be warned, the second and third movies feature some bad aspect ratio errors, however these are easy to overlook.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the documentary that is split into three sections. Although I would have liked it better presented in the same manner as similar documentaries on the STAR WARS and INDIANA JONES sets (ie all together), this is a minor quibble for they are uniformly informative and entertaining.<br /><br />Also of note in this set is an audio track from a lengthy presentation that Director Bob Zemeckis made to a college class on the movies.<br /><br />If you have yet to add this trilogy to your collection, what are you waiting for?? Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A26BWRBPP4V2WF.html">A26BWRBPP4V2WF</a><br/><p>The DVD is an ideal medium for box sets of this type.  The films look great, sound great, and there's the nice bonus features to keep the fans of the film entertained for many additional hours.  There are two commentaries per DVD, and luckily the participants in the commentaries (Zemeckis, Gale, et al.) are interesting and have some good stories/insights.  There are also a number of little documentaries, on a variety of topics.<p>Clearly, the first Back to the Future is the jewel of the series - fun, fresh (at the time), with outstanding performances that catch just the right spirit.  Both Michael J. Fox (as Marty McFly) and Christopher Lloyd (as Doc Brown) get right into their characters and we have fun because they are having fun.  The time travel is pretty simplistic and follows the one timeline rule - if you change something in the past, the future you know will be altered by it (see the Terminator films, Star Trek, etc.).  However, the filmakers wisely avoid explaining time travel in detail, which is a smart move because it isn't really a science fiction film, but a comedy.<p>Back to the Future II is much more a polished exercise in filmaking, and it feels somewhat like a technical exercise.  Because the timeline winds back and forth between 4 time periods (including two different versions of the year 1985), it certainly benefits from a second or third viewing.  Watch it to admire the technical skill, and the deft juggling of the time travel - Marty gets to watch himself play at the Enchantment Under the Sea dance, for example - and try to avoid the cynical thought that the filmakers are just trying to repackage the 1st film to make more money.<p>I was very disappointed in the third film when I saw it in the theatres, but it's growing on me since then.  It is still the weakest of the three - it's a little thin on plot and the dialogue is definitely below the standard of the first two.  However, it comes together with a fitting if artificially cheerful conclusion at the end.</p></br></body></html>

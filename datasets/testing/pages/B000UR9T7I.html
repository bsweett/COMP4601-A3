But I really did think it would be nigh impossible for this 2007 film to be better than its 2004 predecessor, which is my favorite comic book movie to date (a verdict I render as someone who teaches comic books in general and Spider-Man in particular in my Introduction to Popular Culture course).  "Spider-Man 3" certainly has its flaws and it is not as good as "Spider-Man 2," but those things do not add up to the film being a disappointment.<br /><br />For Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Spider-Man these are the best of times.  Spider-Man is beloved by the people of New York City and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) has given Peter the engagement ring that she received from Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) a half-century earlier so that he can propose to Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  But Harry Osborn (James Franco) knows that Peter is Spider-Man, believes Spidey killed his father Norman (Willem Dafoe), and has found the secret Green Goblin hideout.  So right off the bat he comes gunning for Spider-Man.  This seems like they are trying to wrap up a loose plot thread from "Spider-Man 2," but this is but one of the several major pieces this movie puts in place for the endgame.  Meanwhile, Flint Marko (Thomas Hayden Church) has broken out of jail and become the victim of one of those classic comic book situations where science turns a man into a monster, in this case the Sandman.  When Peter finds out it was Marko who actually shot Uncle Ben he takes his first step off the deep end.  Peter also has problems in that ambitious Eddie Brock, Jr. (Topher Grace) wants Peter's job as a photographer at "The Daily Bugle," where J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons).  Then there is Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), a classmate of Peter who gets rescued by Spider-Man and has a big old crush on the web-head, and the sticky black thing from another planet that has attached itself to our hero.  No wonder the movie runs 140 minutes.<br /><br />Director Sam Raimi pours on the special effects in the computer generated fight sequences.  What made Doctor Octopus a great villain for a Spider-Man movie was how the two could fight on both the horizontal and vertical axises.  Obviously that continues with Venom and to a lesser extent with Sandman, but what those two villains have in common is the fluidity of their "costume" and "body" respectively.  They have fun making Spider-Man's costume all torn and tattered, but that is nothing compared to what they are able to do with Sandman's face and body in these fight sequences.  When Spidey fights the New Goblin (and there is a reason Harry is not running around as the second Green Goblin), it looks more like a high-speed video game with everything happening faster than the eye can see (compare that with the great fight between Peter and Harry when they are not wearing their costumes).<br /><br />For me the problematic character is Gwen Stacy, because in the original "Spider-Man" comic books Gwen was Peter's girlfriend long before Mary Jane became his wife.  Given the relatively small number of Spider-Man movies that you can make, it made sense to skip Gwen and have Mary Jane there from the beginning, even if it meant turning her into the girl next door instead of the sexy redhead in the go-go boots.  But we now know that Peter ends up with MJ, just like we know Clark Kent ends up with Lois Lane and Bruce Wayne is never going to get married.  So Gwen's mere presence is problematic because she cannot be the woman he loves who dies because he is Spider-Man.  In the "Ultimate Spider-Man" comic book MJ is there from the beginning too, knowing Spider-Man's secret identity, and the integration of Gwen's character into that revision of the story was okay, but it did not have the significance or resonance of the original storyline.  The movie Gwen is more like the comic book Mary Jane and that whole plot line would have worked better with Betty Brant (Elizabeth Banks) or an entirely new character than resurrecting Gwen Stacy.<br /><br />Besides the delicious irony that the blond Dunst has died her hair red while the redheaded Howard has gone platinum, I was bothered by how they had Gwen be a model.  Mary Jane was the model and that was important because just like Peter it was a mistake to take her at face value.  Instead Dunst gets to sing a couple of songs and while the movie agrees she is not good enough to sing on Broadway it seems a strange way to create a crack in her self-confidence, especially given that nobody faked self-confidence better than MJ.  But they are fully committed to the idea of Mary Jane as the girl next door even if they have yet to figure out what that means for the character and her relationship with Peter.  Howard is not given much to do, although her last moment is her character's best, and the same goes for James Cromwell as Captain Stacy.  But Bruce Campbell completely steals his one scene, Mageina Tovah as Ursula steals a couple, and Stan Lee has his best "Spider-Man" cameo to date, but Dylan Baker's Dr. Curt Connors is still no closer to turning into the Lizard.<br /><br />The main element they have kept from "Spider-Man 2" is the idea that the conflict between Spider-Man and his foes is no longer black and white, but shades of gray.  I liked that for once Doctor Octopus was not a ranting lunatic with mechanical arms but a good man turned evil by a fateful accident (the flip of what happened to Peter Parker) who refuses to die a monster.  It was that moment more than Mary Jane discovering that Peter was Spider-Man that really gave "SM2" its weight.  This time around there are important shadings for Flint Marko and Harry Osborn, just as there are for Peter Parker as his black Spider-Man costume gets the better of him (but Eddie Brock, Jr. is bad to the bone from start to finish).<br /><br />In the end I round down on "Spider-Man 3" because I think they are overdoing it with Spider-Man's mask coming off or being half torn (even though I understand the impulse to have the face of the actor you are paying millions to actually appear on screen), the comic relief from spectators during the big battle at the end gets in the way of the developing tragedy, and the fade out scene was by far the weakest of the series to date.  I am also not happy with the way Peter's character is regressing, because even before the symbiotic flips him to the dark side he is embracing his inner nerd way too much.  Maguire is hysterical when he has Peter strut himself down the street, but it rings wrong for the character.  Also, even with the swelled head he is getting from the public adoration as Spider-Man, I do not want to believe that having the costume on when he receives the key to the city was enough to let Peter betray MJ the way he does there.  The scene later on at the Jazz club is the insult; it was the other that was the real injury part of the equation.  Still, I bet I make it back to the theater to see this one again.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Firstly I have to say this movie was enjoyable to an certain extent but the rest of it ended up being a disappointment. The plot was so underdeveloped that it turn out to be ridiculous, Tobey Maguire's character has so many mood swings that I couldn't help but wish I saved my gas and ticket money. The villains were mediocre; the ones which should have had more time on screen didn't live up to their potential. We should have been warned when Raimi said in an interview that he was never a fan of Venom. Spiderman represents good, Venom is evil. It's a classic match up, yet Raimi decided to add 30 minutes of Peter Parker becoming emo, thrusting his hips, and a dance sequence. Why have an epic battle between good and evil when you shoot yourself in the foot and focus on hormones? I bet if I would have tried to come up with a way to ruin this movie, I wouldn't have come close to what Raimi accomplished.<br /><br />And two and a half hours?! They could've made probably 2 decent movies out of those 3 villains and made each one a normal length. Why they decided to fill in as many characters as possible and give them all a whopping 10 minutes of background is beyond me. These are comic book characters, they're hard to make believable in the first place. You really need to give a character like that some depth for an audience to not want to ridicule them. Sandman and the new goblin both admirable foes and both shown well, however venom could have been so much more and came across far too weak as far as I am concerned and seemed to be slipped on the back of an average film to try and boost ratings. I am not one for cliffhangers in large franchises, I mean the only reason I didn't see the 3rd matrix film was because the cliffhanger was pointless and the second film killed off any point of a third, however a full venom film would have made sense due to its sheer fantastic reasoning and design, even introducing the character carnage would have been fantastic, but he seems rushed in this film, and that not the way to win over die hard fans and new fans the like!<br /><br />This movie will continue to be seen by lots viewers so there's no point on recommending this. It does has some great action sequences and the Bruce Campbell cameo was fantastic, however do not watch this thinking you are going to get the same quality and attention to detail as the first two films, watch it like X-Men 3, as this is just what it is, a good trilogy spoilt by the lack of development and the need to force as many characters in at once.</p></br><a href="../users/A27FR2C67JPDRS.html">A27FR2C67JPDRS</a><br/><p>Spidey, everyone's favorite webslinger, has returned to the summer box office....reloaded with twice the amount of villains, 3 times the amount of action and triple the romance.  Now the question on everyone's mind....is it as good as the other two?<br /><br />Well, not really.  Its not a bad film by any means but the third go around lost a little of the charm.  Tobey Maquire remains endearing as lovable nerd, Peter Parker, who is a diligent student by day and crime fighter every available minute of the day.  Kirsten Dunst is also back as Mary Jane, Peter's girlfriend who, in this film, is having an emotional meltdown.  And, James DeFranco, returns as well becoming the New Goblin, reviving his rivalry and hatred for his former friend, Peter Parker.  JK Simmons also gives us laughs as stressed out and Spidey hatin' Daily Bugle editor, J Jonah Jameson.<br /><br />New additions include Topher Grace, who does a decent job as Eddie Brock, who eventually becomes the evil Venom.  Thomas Hayden Church is the Sandman, a onetime crook who is linked to the death of Peter's Uncle Ben.  And then there is the beautiful Gwen Stacey, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, who throws a little tension into the Peter/Mary Jane romance.<br /><br />So with all the amped-up action sequences, the extra stars and big budget you'd expect that Spidey 3 would trounce its predecessors.  The problem is this----sometimes you can simple OVERDO IT!  This is the case with Spiderman 3.  Things are so jam packed with extra villains and all the action sequences (my favorite being a scene at the beginning with Gwen Stacey and a runaway crane) that the story seems to just fall into the background.  Things are rushed this time to get us to Spidey vs Venom/Sandman and some things (such as the alien lifeforce that attaches itself to its host) go completely unexplained.<br /><br />With a record breaking weekend haul of 148 million domestically, it is certain we are hungry for a new Spiderman movie.  Let's hope, however, that our next viewing of the worlds favorite webslinger returns to a simpler, more story driven movie with enough action to keep us interested but not enough to bog the film down.  Worth watching---a good popcorn movie but not as good as the best in the series, Spiderman 2 or the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A13DQTXG02HZC1.html">A13DQTXG02HZC1</a><br/><p>Sometimes, a movie is overhyped & it faces the risk of underwhelming the audience. This franchise was excellent under the guidance of Sam Raimi & I had my reservation if it's going to have an uneventful death as XMen3.  Fortunately, Spiderman 3 is still good when it could have been an outstanding classic. One outstanding trait from Sam is that he seldoms portrays the villains as two dimensional but that they are portrayed as victims of their circumstances.  This is intact for the third offering.  However, a better editing or a tighter script could have ironed out a few lull spots particularly Parker's relationship with Mary Jane which tended to drag on. In the cinema, I could see a large number of audience shifting uncomfortably looking for some actions.  The editor of the Daily Bugle is naturally the comic relief for this offering & so was Bruce Campbell from the Evil Dead.  I'm glad that the twists in this movie isn't revealed or else it would spoil the fun of others who haven't watched this movie.  Having said that, for comic book fans, you probably know already.  I do pick up nice messages from this movie, that ultimately, all of us have a choice in life.  At times, we might have lost our way but then, we need to persevere & we need to have self belief to bring the best out within ourselves.  This is arguably one of the most expensive movie ever made and it shows.  The final climatic battle is worth every penny.  Commendable watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N.html">A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N</a><br/><p>Well, the Spiderman franchise continues with the third (and hopefully last) installment. I wasn't terribly impressed with Spiderman 3, even less than the second film. Much of the same action takes place, far too much CGI for my eyes to digest. The plot continues as Peter Parker gets more comfortable being Spiderman and is a little less awkward and clumsy as before (well, sort of).He and Marry Jane are due to be married, and his best friend Harry turned "Green Goblin" is out to destroy Spiderman for the death of his father, the original Green Goblin.<br /><br />  Two new characters are introduced, Sandman and Venom (I'll get to those in a bit). A mysterious asteroid plummets and hits smack dab in the middle of New York, and wouldn't ya know it? Within walking distance of Peter and Marry Jane (how convenient).A weird, alien parasite creeps from the asteroid and hitches a ride on Peter's mope head. We also learn of The Sandman who is supposedly the real murderer of Peter Parker's Uncle. The sandman wasn't always the Sandman, as we get to see his creation due to his escape from jail and on the run from police to his unfortunate timing and "science" mishap.<br /><br />  Pete begins undergoing strange behaviors as the mysterious, black, alien substance finds its way onto his outfit. Parker then seems to pretty much act like a jerk to everyone and pushes Marry Jane further and further away. Pete discovers the origin of not only his behavior, but his bad luck as well and literally tears it off of himself; there under "convenience" his next nemesis is born, "Venom" as the alien substance finds a new host...someone caught in the wake of Spiderman's own bad behavior and vows to destroy Spiderman. In the end, Peter makes good with his friend Harry and the two duke things out with Sandman and Venom. We find out that Peter's Uncle's death was an accident, and well...Harry sacrifices himself for his buddy and Venom is obliterated from existence.<br /><br />  There are far too many subplots and things going on in the third installment, not that you can't follow it...but even in comic book terms...this would take many issues to develop instead of being summed up inside of 2 1/2 hours. The CGI was too much, although the action sequences would not have been possible without it. I didn't care much about Sandman, nor did I Venom or even Harry as the "New Green Goblin". The characters (as hard as Rami tried) were as one dimensional as the comic characters, actually...allot worse. I hope that Sam Rami, a director who I admire has Spiderman out of his system and moves onto bigger and better projects? I ultimately hope for a return and continuation of "The Evil Dead". Spiderman 3 is watchable, but only good for one viewing. I wouldn't rent it again, and certainly wouldn't recommend buying it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y.html">A3W1JJGJHRPH4Y</a><br/><p>My wife and I discussed the plot and how it could be improved. The accusation of too many villains has been suggested by reviewers. However, each villian contributes in substantive ways to the emotional climax. My biggest complaint is the reworking of how Peter's uncle died. It didn't quite fit with the original movie.<br /><br />I'm not sure what's wrong with the plot, but it just seems weak. It has been a while since I've read the comic book; however, this plot seems like a soap opera. Peter and his girlfriend have many troubles. However, they seem more like troubles kids would have in junior high rather than two adults in their twenties. For the soap opera plot devices: amnesia for Goblin is introduced; Goblin is then healed and is evil again; and then forces MJ to break up with Peter.  Also a character who is a top model, the commissioner's daughter, and is in all of Peter's classes is introduced just to make things complicated.<br /><br />Another problem with the plot is venom. A meteorite hits and it just happens to be a few hundred yards from where Peter is. This gives venom an opportunity to slither onto the Peter's scooter. Talk about Deus ex machina.<br /><br />The movie lacks humor also. There are a few very good lines, but on the whole it is not very entertaining.<br /><br />On the positive side, the CGI and other special effects were very good. The Sandman effects were very good. Spidey's swinging was even better than the last film. The acting was ok. I thought Church was very good. Maguire looked a little emaciated, he almost had the Gollum look going on in some scenes. There were musical numbers in this movie and they just did not fit.<br /><br />In summary, the movie is ok. It's long, so keep your expectations low and it may work for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A28B7IJR80M8KE.html">A28B7IJR80M8KE</a><br/><p>This one has been trashed by most fans, maybe marketing Venom who only has maybe 20 minutes screen time as a major villian was a bad idea here, I don't know, I fail to see where the overated "Spiderman 2" is considered the best one, this one to me is the best one because it pulls no punches, Tobey McGuire really gets to let loose with Peter's dark side here, which was fun, & Kirsten Dunst really looks her best here, she was pretty in the first two, but here, she really shines in her beauty, also, Bryce Dallas Howard is also nice to look at here & looks just like her comic book character, Topher Grace was the last guy I pictured as Venom, but I think he pulled it off in the end, he was really having fun with it no doubt, but I think what I really liked was how the characters developed more here, Harry as the new Goblin was a bit underused, but no doubt effective, however his teaming up with Spiderman in the end never happened in the comics, but there teaming up here was a nice change of pace, this ending was much better than the first two films ending, the building construction sequence with Mary Jane's fate hanging in the balance was a bit more intense & threatning that what we were given in the first two films, although I think they probably could have done without Sandman, still, he too was a fun villian, of the 3 films this is my favorite, J.K. Simmons once again chews up the scenery as Jonah Jameson, talk about having fun with a character, all in all, the best of the three in my view..</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco and Thomas Haden Church<br />star in Sam Raimi's 2007 action sequel. Peter Parker/Spider-Man<br />gets infected by an alien parasite and faces a sand enemy.<br />This sequel's good, but a little long. This 2-disc special<br />edition has nice picture and sound plus cool extras.<br />I recommend this.</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>In Spiderman 3 Toby Maguire wears his nerdy, simpy, goofy look. The New York Times (11/1/08) refers to him as "a bespectacled nebbish who has been bitten by a radioactive spider." Along with that screwy appearance, he has an enormous ego which his girlfriend Kirsten Dunst finds extremely annoying. His Spiderman persona has made him insufferable because he's so stuck on himself. Kirsten is annoyed because she is trying to make it on Broadway, and she needs a boost. She gets the boot from her show, and he is unaware of it and continues to see himself as the publicly acclaimed super hero.<br /> Later in the movie he is taken over by some meteoric black sticky goo which makes his costume black, gives him extra strength, a lot of sex appeal, and an evil streak. For a time, he's a villain, but the movie already has three other villains to keep the audience busy. Nome of them are evil in the way that the Joker is in the new Batman (2008).<br /> Twice in the movie Spiderman villains seemed to have been dispatched forever, but to my dismay, the villains come back to haunt me, Spiderman and the audience for additional mayhem.<br /> There are three super-villains in this movie: the Sandman, Venom, and the new Goblin. All three of them seem to have good streaks in them as well. The Sandman didn't mean to kill Toby's uncle, and he loves his little daughter. William Dafoe makes a cameo appearance as the father of semi-villain Harry Osborne.<br /> Naturally there's a lot of action with vehicles being tossed around like toothpicks. No deaths of innocents are shown, but how scores escaped death is beyond me.<br /> There are a lot of yuks and campy spots in this movie. Toby Maguire seems ill-suited as the civilian component of a superhero because he's so gawky and dorky. Its comic book origins are kept intact.</p></br><a href="../users/A35L2E8M7S59MQ.html">A35L2E8M7S59MQ</a><br/><p>One of the most anticipated movies of summer 2007 Spider-Man 3 ended as possibly the biggest letdown.  The spirit that had driven the first two films seems to fizzle in a film that just doesn't have a story to work with its substantial budget.<br /><br />The original Spider-Man was a great popcorn film, providing a good live-action adaptation of the character's development while Spider-Man 2 was one of the best superhero features ever put on film.  So why does a sequel involving the same cast and director fail?  I personally believe it was art.  Director Sam Raimi seems so caught up in dazzling the audience with visual spectacles that he loses the heart of the previous films.  The special effects drive this film which is never a good thing.  Human elements are lost, and thus the film fails.  Sorry to say Tobey Maguire's portrayal of Peter Parker and Spider-Man is amusing, but it isn't in the same league as Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow who'll pull in the crowds.  The acting in these films has been good, but no character has ever stood out to the point of wanting to see the movie for the character alone.  J. Jonah Jameson is probably the most enjoyable character of all three films, but of course no one wants to see a movie based on him.<br /><br />Part of the no plot problem is the villain overdose this film suffers from.  How they went from Green Goblin in the first one, Doctor Octopus in the second (my favorite of the web-slinger's villains) to the third with New Goblin, Sandman and Venom.  That's THREE villains, Sandman and Venom not getting enough character development for  the villain to care about them as characters, and you only know New Goblin because, you guessed it, Harry Osborn's been in the last two  films, prepping for his turn to crime...which also comes across as very forced in this movie.  Not to try and spoil the film, but to save viewer groans he has a period where he hits his head and forgets Peter's Spider-Man, but of course remembers later on.  The fact that they used that clich&eacute; is something I can't understand.<br /><br />Moving on to Venom and Sandman, we get a mixed issue.  Neither of these characters gets the screen time required to have the viewer care for them, especially Sandman.  Another problem I have is after they went through all the trouble of bringing realism to Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus, Sandman still looks and dresses exactly as he does in the 60s comic books, but not to discredit him entirely some of the Sandman effects in the film provide great entertainment.  Then we have Venom, who I actually liked the design of, but even if Eddie was fleshed out he must only be Venom for the last fifteen minutes of this movie, and knowing how many fans the character has this will come as a major disappointment to say the least.<br /><br />Going back to visuals and specials effects; this film suffers from some of the same problems the original Spider-Man film did, and that's at times the special effects seem to deny reality in many ways.  Characters seem to fly through the air as if they are weightless, and some things just defy physics and logic, no matter how cool it looks on screen.  Spider-Man 2 didn't suffer from this, Doctor Octopus and Spidey seemed to have weight to them when they fought on building tops and fought across The Big Apple.  Sandman turning into a sandstorm and flying around (probably against the wind too) doesn't seem to cut it as real.<br />Overall Spider-Man 3 is a great display of visuals, but not that great of a movie.  Lots of it looks like they had a concept artist sketch some cool images out which Raimi just randomly slapped in their (such as Spider-Man crouching in front of an American flag).  Could've worked as a poster collection, or comic book, just not as one of the most highly anticipated movies of the year.<br /><br />Spider-Man 3, I give it a solid 3/5 Stars</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>So, Spidey gets a little mean in this one.  I'd say it has half as much to do with the symbiotic alien life form known as Venom that attaches itself to him, and half to do with Mary Jane's hedonistic, prostitutorial ways.  Allow me to explain...<br /><br />While Spidey is solving crime, risking his life, and being a hero, he still has to deal with family and a girlfriend.  And his cult hero status - something won with much difficulty - doesn't seem to sit well with Mary Jane.  During a celebration of Spiderman saving the day once again, along with the life of a beautiful young blonde who makes Mary Jane look like a ginger hobo, the attention Spiderman gets is just a bit too much.  She can't stand someone else being the center of attention, and since she got her little feewings hurt by getting fired from a musical, she was looking to redirect the pain.  Spidey gets a celebratory kiss and Mary Jane, being the whore she is, cheats on Spiderman without any sympathy whatsoever.  Seriously, who cheats on Spiderman!?<br /><br />Unfortunately, she also helps to turn Spidey into a complete idiot, prancing around like a complete retard and making a fool of himself in front of every attractive woman he sees.  He pops his collar and gets an emo haircut, and is obviously emotionally damaged.  Luckily, he takes a date to Mary Jane's place of employment and teases her unmercifully, and she deserves every second of it.<br /><br />Along the way Spidey continues the battle versus the legacy of the Green Goblin, as well as the Sandman, and the aforementioned Venom (with new host).  Tons of action, great special effects, and the perpetual cameos of Stan Lee are all present.<br /><br />I loved the movie; it was an incredible comic adaptation, but I obviously hated Mary Jane.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GPEV42IO41CI.html">A2GPEV42IO41CI</a><br/><p>When we left Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) at the end of Spider-Man 2, he had not only revealed his identity as Spider-Man to Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), but his love for her as well.  The third installment opens happily enough with MJ starring on Broadway and Pete about to propose.  Of course, sticky situations start popping up right away, beginning with a creeping tar-like substance from space that attaches itself to Peter, changing him from sweet Spidey to mean-spirited Black-suited Spider-Man.<br /><br />This would have been enough conflict to deal with for a very good movie, but, unfortunately, we are introduced to two new villains - Sandman and Venom, as well as pal Harry Osborn (James Franco)'s New Goblin.  The first two films had one villain to focus on, but this is too much; none of the story lines has a chance to develop and the movie gets too crowded and choppy.  Toss in the third retelling of Uncle Ben's death and Bryce Dallas Howard in a thankless role and we end up with a disappointing movie.<br /><br />We do get to see Tobey Maguire show a wider emotional range this time, which is good; he starts as the loveable geek and changes into a conceited and nasty guy who thinks he's a macho muffin, strutting down the street like John Travolta in "Saturday Night Fever."  Dunst is fine as the long-suffering girlfriend and struggling starlet, and Franco gives a strong performance as the loyal pal turned arch villain.  Despite the quality of acting, I felt there were too many characters and subplots to keep track of and too much CGI, which makes it cartoony.  I give this least entertaining film in the series 3.5 stars - unnecessary subplots detract from the overall fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N0LBOUQAD1BG.html">A3N0LBOUQAD1BG</a><br/><p>Based on when I saw it in theaters in May.<br /><br />"Spider-Man III" turned out to be a bigger disappointment than I thought it would be and I had somewhat high hopes for it, especially after "Spider-Man II" let me down a bit, wait make that a lot.<br /><br />I'll try not to break down a huge synopsis of the film, but it picks up where II left off, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is trying to balance life as Spidey, his job and his relationship with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). Of course his friend Harry Osborne (James Franco) is still mad at him for killing his dad and a good action/fight sequence follows where Harry dons the new Goblin gear and attacks Peter when he's just in his regular clothes. Some good, no great special effects and sprinkled throughout the fight and Harry ends up bumping his head and loses his short term memory for a while, which is prolonged longer than it should've been in this overly long film.<br /><br />There's also an escaped convict (Thomas Hayden Church) who gets turned into a pile of sand that can take human form, sort of like Imhotep in "The Mummy", but this time the effects and the character, though somewhat cool seem unnecessary and no more than filler.<br /><br />There's also an alien symbiote that bonds with Peter and makes his suit a cool looking black, amplifies his power, brings out his aggressive side towards his enemies and others and makes him act like a fool around women.<br /><br />Obviously, like in the comics and cartoons, the symbiote will attach itself to Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) and become the ultra cool villain Venom and here in lies the biggest problem with the movie. By the time the symbiote dettachs itself from Peter and attachs to Brock to become Venom, the film has lost quite a bit of steam, though Venom looks cool, he's not in the film nearly enough, which was a big minus, but unfortunately I expected that to happen.<br /><br />There are some neat sequences in the movie, the aforementioned Goblin/Peter fight, a couple of the Sandman fights and the scenes with Venom, but too much of the movie is sappy and bogged down with trying to add sympathy, when it should be having a little more fun.<br /><br />One of the film's biggest problems, besides Venom's lack of screen time, is the fact that too many scenes throughout the movie feel like individual scenes and don't really have a lot of flow to them, which really detracts from what could've been a great, fun movie.<br /><br />It's still a fun movie for the most part, there's good humor (not the iced-dairy product) in some of the scenes, like almost any line or reaction by J.K. Simmons who plays Jameson, loved when he walked in on his secretary and Peter flirting and he says "Ms. Yates, that's not the position I hired you for". I also enjoyed Bruce Campbell's appearance as the Matre'd at a French Restaurant, very funny stuff, "I am French".<br /><br />Too bad there wasn't more to the movie besides the visual effects and humor, which should be more than you need for most summer movies, but this one felt like it needed more.<br /><br />The acting wasn't too bad, actually Church did a great job creating emotion for the Sandman character, but again it started to feel sappy after a while, same goes for Harry as the Goblin. A lot of the acting was not that good either and again the scenes seemed separate from each other, no real flow.<br /><br />After watching the movie twice, once with my two best friends and others at a midnight show, which was fun for the crowd reactions and again a week or so later with my girlfriend, I summed up the movie with the following assessment "It felt too long, but rushed at the same time", a lethal (and not the good kind of lethal) combination.<br /><br />Not a bad movie, but no where near as good as the first and it doesn't give me as much hope as I had before of another three or possible four sequels still to come, if the rumors are true.</p></br><a href="../users/A1435P5AMCPB3X.html">A1435P5AMCPB3X</a><br/><p>If you are a fan of the other two movies, then this will be a bit of a slower movie, and a slight let down, but still well worthy of four stars.  There are some really corny parts that are hard to take, but otherwise, this has the action, the back story, and decent characters to boot.  There are a few to many villians at one point, and it feels like the movie rushes all at once to try and give everyone their place, but still runs together well overall.  Check this film out in the theaters, worth buying on DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QEATH3NODFM.html">A38QEATH3NODFM</a><br/><p>This being the third in a series, Spiderman 3 has really created a lot of buzz, and criticism, and continues to break box office records.  I movie was good, but I'll admit it was slower at the beginning, and it was hard to figure out how they would tie the whole thing together, but the did a fair job, and of course left it open for another film. I guess their is a plan to do 5 movies total.  So, as expected, this being the third movie, the plot may be slower, but hopefully it will be a good building block for 4,5, and 6 (planned so far).  3 villans was a bit much, Sandman, Venom, and the new Goblin-harry osbourne, but agian it was tied together at the end. I did feel this was a bit more violent than the other 2 films, so parents, i would watch this first before having the kids see it.  So for those who are worried about all the criticism, think of it in similar terms as the star wars trilogy, they have been out for many years, and millions of different answer are around at which one is the best, but together they are a film dynesty that will live on forever regardless of the pieces.  Spiderman will be the same, so think of this as another piece in the set, awaiting completion.  Must see in theaters, definitely will be on the shelf when able to purchase.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>Oh, Man this was an awesome movie, it had more touching sense in this one than the first one, well thats good. they are making spider-man like real life events. And the best part is that Spider-Man's most deadly foe Venom is in it. Oh and don't forget Sandman, which one character i wasn't sure of but sam Puled it off. and don't forget the return of the green goblin, or in this case he is Called New Goblin, the three movies stuck to the origin of the green goblin on how Norman becomes the goblin, dies and urges harry to become the new goblin and succeds. and i'm very happy that they stuck with the original cast. I Love J.K. Simmons as JJ. he acts and looks like the character. I Hope if they make a 4th film that saM Puts Scorpion in it. I know they were talkning about carnage that would be sweet and Tobey McGuire better not quit. And all ther other actors better not quit. If they do i know the movie will go down hill. And sam Raimi better not quit either.  Well I hope they  do make number 4. Oh The Guy who played sandman was awesome and Venom Rules. They could've not picked Better Actors To Play those Characters.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>I suppose a film like this will fall into one of two categories for fans of this series: either this was the best of the three or the worst. My vote goes to it being the "best" and especially on this Blu-Ray disc, which looks spectacular. However, I did find this movie extremely entertaining and not just because of the sharp transfer.  It's a fun film.<br /><br />Silly? Yes, but it's a Marvel Comics cartoon-come-to-life, so anything goes. A little too long? Probably.....yet I was never bored watching this, and I - and I assume most people - certainly got their money's worth for action, special effects, cool villains, romance, sentiment, good vs. evil, revenge vs. forgiveness, etc.<br /><br /> Even two main characters: Spider-Man and his pal Harry - both had two different personalities in this story. There is so much material packed into this movie, it almost too much for one sitting. The film can wear you out!.<br /><br />Myself, I thought "The Sandman" was the coolest part of this movie. I've read a few of the comic books and thought he was the most interesting of the villains so I was curious to see how he'd be presented in here. I was not disappointed. His scenes were awesome!<br /><br />This is a rare film: a ton of action and, at the end, a sincere message of forgiveness, not revenge, being the answer. Wow, is that refreshing to hear. Yes, revenge is more fun - no doubt......but never as satisfying.<br /><br />For a little over two hours of totally escapist entertainment, this fills the bill.</p></br><a href="../users/A155X6KYOPQEZ5.html">A155X6KYOPQEZ5</a><br/><p>I really enjoyed watching the third installment of the Spiderman series. The plot is great, the animation is outstanding, and the acting is great. Peter Parker's life gets turned around when a black symbiote attaches itself to his suit. The suit enhances his powers, but makes his heart turn dark. Will Spiderman be able to defeat the powers of the black suit?</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>The third and most likely the last of the Spider-Man saga starring Tobey Maguire came to an end with the '07 release of `Spider-Man 3'.This film didn't live up to the expectations of Spidey fans for several reasons, the one most often mentioned is the numerous bad guys muddied the plot and eliminated and opportunity to further explore the psyche of the man behind the mask.<br /><br />A further annoyance to his fan base was that the plot itself was designed to expose and amplify the darkside of Peter Parker's personality which was a dangerous risk for the filmmakers to take since it deprived the audience of the shy, nerdish persona that everyone loved and could relate to.<br /><br />To be honest I hated this film upon my first viewing and couldn't wait for it to end. However after taking a second look at it with new eyes I discovered that it was actually quite good, just different. Admittedly not as good as the first two but still worth a watch or two.<br /><br />My Rating: -3 1/2 Stars-.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFXFHO2N9WJB.html">AIFXFHO2N9WJB</a><br/><p>After two hugely successful films, "Spiderman" and "Spiderman 2" respectively, Sony Pictures `Spiderman' franchise was definitely at the top of its game entering into the third, and for the moment, the supposed final chapter in the `Spiderman' series, at least as far as stars Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst may be concerned (their contracts were only good for three movies). So, with the primary cast assembled once again, Sam Raimi back in the director's chair, and also serving as co-writer with his brother Ivan and acclaimed writer Alvin Sargent ("Spiderman 2"), the latest chapter for good ol' web head was shaping up to be just as epic, and no doubt visually amazing, as its predecessors. Throw in a few more villains than usual, Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), Venom (Topher Grace), and New Goblin (James Franco), to mess with Spidey's life and loves, along with a certain black space goo that will bring out the worst in Peter's psyche, and Spiderman may just be in for a bigger fight than even he can handle. Not to mention the fact that Peter Parker/Spiderman, and all those aforementioned talented people responsible for bringing the character to life, must face the daunting task of attempting to top the first 2 films; but hey, superheroes are used to the odds being stacked against them so this film may have ended up being just business as usual for Spidey, but only time would tell.<br /><br />"Spiderman 3" begins with Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) becoming swept up in his own hype as the citizens of New York are embracing a sort of Spidey-mania craze. As happy as Peter Parker/Spiderman's life seems to be, events are being set into motion that will soon bring him down off of his high. Peter's girlfriend, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is having difficulty finding success on Broadway, and with Peter's newfound arrogance, she is slowly beginning to get jealous of his rising popularity. Also, Peter's former best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), has embraced his father's dark ways and has become the New Goblin, and his only goal is to see Spiderman pay for his father's death. As if this old friend turned new villain, and the possibility of losing his longtime love wasn't enough to deal with, a new super-villain is created in the form of the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church). To top things off a strange alien substance has landed on Earth, and has found a kind of kindred spirit in the newly arrogant Spiderman, and as it bonds to its new host, the alien symbiote begins to slowly corrupt Spidey's soul, until he no longer knows who he truly is any longer. This time the odds may just be too much for Spiderman to handle by himself.<br /><br />If there is one thing that can be said about "Spiderman 3" that audiences and critics everywhere can agree on, it's the fact that this film is definitely the biggest in the franchise thus far. That aside, "Spiderman 3" found our hero not just in new territory by facing more than one villain in the film, but also finding himself disliked by many movie critics and audiences. Where the first two films were universally liked by everyone, this movie split audiences fairly even in their reactions to it. Many felt the story was far too bloated, with way too many new characters introduced, which resulted in uneven character development in some instances, giving the movie a disjointed feel that lacked the smooth flow of the previous two films and even made it a little difficult to follow. Another problem some audiences had was that the movie seemed to focus more on action than on the personal dramas being played out by the characters, not to mention the ending left people a little cold due to some corny dialogue between Peter and Harry, and a somewhat sappy and unbelievable resolution to the Sandman conflict. For those that enjoyed the movie, there were still some gripes that were shared with those that disliked it, but for the most part the gripes didn't seem to affect their view of the movie too much. I for one enjoyed "Spiderman 3", but found it to be the least enjoyable out of the series so far, still it's better than a lot of the action movies that Hollywood churns out. I agreed with some of the sentiments from those that hated the movie, but found some of their thoughts to be off in my opinion. Where I agree the most with those that disliked the film, is in the disappointing resolution to Sandman's conflict with Spiderman, especially in light of events that had occurred moments before between the two characters, but apparently Sam Raimi and his writers liked the resolution, though one does wonder why. Although, it did seem as if the writers were trying too hard to top themselves, which is a possible explanation for why this movie had so much going on, I must disagree with those who found the movie to be too hard to follow or lacked any sense of flow, apparently those audience members must not have been paying attention during the movie.<br /><br />The cast for "Spiderman 3" continues the tradition of excellence that this series had set forth with the very first movie. Tobey Maguire once again portrays the dual persona of Peter Parker/Spiderman, and this time he gets to show off a new side to Peter that had previously remained untapped, which would be his darker side. This element to the character's story arc was on one hand one of the true highlights of the film, but on the other was one of the film's weak points. I enjoyed seeing an angrier, more aggressive Spiderman, and the black suit definitely looked sleek and cool; however, I grew tired of Peter's darker side being essentially an uber-nerd, granted this is most likely true to character, but a little less of this side could have been shown and I would have been much happier, I especially could have done with some editing during the sequence where Peter is checking out all of the ladies on the streets of New York (too much cheese for my taste). Kirsten Dunst looked much better as Mary Jane Watson in this film than she did in "Spiderman 2", I don't know what happened in the previous movie, but she looked way too pale and even a little unattractive, not to mention the redness in her hair didn't even come close to matching her color in the first film. Thankfully, the make-up and wardrobe department must have heard the complaints from moviegoers that felt the same way about her in "Spiderman 2", and appeared to work harder at matching the hair color from the first film, and actually applying make-up and putting her in clothes that were more stylish and attractive. I mean come on, this is a girl who is supposed to be an actress, yet she dressed in such an unattractive manner that I didn't like seeing her on screen that much, so it was a welcome adjustment in that respect. From a character standpoint, Mary Jane didn't seem to evolve much over the course of this film, her anger at Peter was understandable in certain instances, but in others seemed rather juvenile and out of character. James Franco seemed to really come into his own with Harry Osborn this time around, as he embraced the darker side of his character to become the New Goblin. Other returning favorites, J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson, and Rosemary Harris as Aunt May, were enjoyable as always, but I found myself wishing for a little bit more Jonah when this film was all said and done. Joining the cast was Thomas Haden Church ("Sideways") as the villainous Sandman, he definitely looked the part, but sadly he wasn't given as much to do as I would have hoped and his character felt a little underused in favor of giving more attention to the other villains in the story. TV star Topher Grace ("That 70's Show") was perfect as the smooth-talking and morally challenged, Eddie Brock, who begins to develop a hatred for Peter Parker and Spiderman, and eventually comes into contact with the very alien symbiote that is plaguing Peter to become one of comic book fans favorite Spiderman villains of all time, Venom. I enjoyed the addition of Venom as a villain for Spidey, but I thought that he would have been better suited to be the only villain in the movie, rather than sharing the stage with two others, plus I wish they would have chosen to have Venom speak more in his monstrous form instead of having the symbiote pull back to show Topher's face a majority of the time... oh well, nothing's perfect I guess.<br /><br />Another highlight for "Spiderman 3" and the previous two films as well, were the numerous visual effects employed throughout the course of the movie. The effects department was definitely at the top of their game for this movie, the fight scenes were visually stunning and exhilarating, moving at an almost break-neck speed. The CGI for Sandman and Venom was among some of the best I have ever seen captured on film, and you could definitely see that no expense was spared in bringing these popular characters to the screen, and audiences absolutely loved it, regardless of what their overall opinion on the movie may have been.<br /><br />In the end, "Spiderman 3" was an entertaining installment in the franchise, and would be a fitting end to this hero's journey if that is what is decided. However, I must agree that the story did seem a bit bloated at times and some judicious editing could have been done to smooth things out a little more. Although there were times that I found myself wishing for things to have gone differently over the course of the film, overall I enjoyed the experience of watching this movie, and will continue to enjoy it time and time again.<br /><br />"Spiderman 3" is rated PG-13 for mild language and violence.</p></br><a href="../users/AJMU8VVFKMZI4.html">AJMU8VVFKMZI4</a><br/><p>2.5 stars.  Friends warned me that this film didn't exactly hold up to expectations, which is probably why I'm watching it a year later and, unfortunately, I have to agree with them.  My complaint is the same as others-too many villains, choppy character development and abrupt plot changes.  One scene Peter is begging for MJ to call him and literally 2 minutes later MJ is asking why he isn't returning HER calls.  Short memory loss, timely butler confessions and just flat out slow pacing-which is the death toll for an action flick.  Honestly, I think they need to stop here, disappear for about a decade and let another generation get a crack at it.  There's just no where to go from here.  There are already too many scenes that give a sense of deja vu.  I've never known so many people plummeting out buildings like they do in this franchise.  I'm not a New Yorker, but I doubt such a problem exists.  Overall, if you're a die hard fan, check it out.  If not, skip it.</p></br><a href="../users/A33XHXRTRZOQ12.html">A33XHXRTRZOQ12</a><br/><p>Now THIS is the way a superhero movie is supposed to be done! First of all, I was fairly impressed by the way "Sandman" was done, though they portrayed him a little too sympathetically, as opposed to the way he was played in the magazine originally. In the original story introducing the character, he was given the standard, smarmy villain's personality....snarling, sassing Spidey whenever he could, threatening ....but in the movie, he's almost always silent as he fights Spiderman...and what FIGHTS!! Boy...Petey didn't like him much, did he?<br /><br />Anyway, as far as I'm concerned, THIS is the Spidey flick Roger Ebert should have saved his "best superhero flick" praise for, (it really IS the best of the Spiderman movies, but none of the Spidey flicks is "the best superhero movie EVER....") Jolly Jonah is the best he's ever been portrayed, live action, Topher Grace was a convincing proto-yuppie as Eddie Brock and all the drama and comedy relief was well done. And is it just me, or was Mary Jane's singing pretty much perfect in that dress rehearsal? Those producers had tin ears!<br /><br />There's a nod to "Daredevil" in the middle of the film, where Brock actually prays to the Almighty in a church, (while Spidey is there with his "Venom" coating,) to "kill Peter Parker" after Parker reveals him as a fraud in the Daily Bugle newsroom. Brock also eventually finds out Peter is Spiderman, so things get hairy from then on. A pattern is made rather obvious as Mary Jane is again used as a pawn in a game of death near the climax of the film. However, this is still handled well, and is a little tenser than the school bus scene in the first Spidey film.<br /><br />All in all, if you thought something was missing from the first "Spiderman" film, as I did, THIS one makes up for it! Rent it, or buy it, and enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2U80IPZXN5V1U.html">A2U80IPZXN5V1U</a><br/><p>After two sucesfull and critically acclaimed movies,Spiderman returns to the big screen in 2007 in his third movie.While most fans knew it wouldn't turn out to be the best of the serie they still expected a good Spiderman movie.This third film in the franchise is certainly entertaining and visualy impressive and even funny at parts some could say.Yet critics said,and i have to agree with them that the decision to have three villains in the movie was probably thw worst thing to do.Those movie producers will say: "the more villains,the better",and Spiderman 3 proves that its not necessarily true.That confused a few,three bad guys in the same movie and battling Spiderman at the same time can indeed be comfusing but still the third film in the series remains a good superhero movie.<br /><br />In my opinion there are way too many superhero movies nowadays as it seems that movie studios have learned how great profits comic superhero based movies could generate.X-Men,Fantastic Four make and countless others made their beggenings on the big screen recently while other older superheroes make a comeback such as Batman,Superman and others.Spiderman managed so far to deliver a great superhero experience troughout all the trilogy and to distinguish from others.The first two films have been great translations of the famous Marvel comic to the big screen,filled with drama,action and with romance as well.Comes this third filled with action and villains,it clearly ain't the best of the three as i expected but it was still a good experience at the theater for me.<br /><br />I this third movie the storyline is kind of wicked because of the three villains but remains pretty solid overral.Peter still has feelings for Mary Jane and turns to another girl.His uncle Ben's death is further explored in this film and the killer's identity as well.Add to that Peter faces dark times with the dark Spidey suit and three villains after him and tha's the movie in short.There probably won't be as fourth Spidey because the actors wanted to move on to do other movies and that is probably packed this one with villains and all that.Also the movie relies on many great special effects maybe too much.<br /><br />Spiderman 3 is different from the other films in the franchise and that is great as sometimes sequels are too much like the original and they have no creativity,or they go too far and completly loose it.Spiderman 3 does not make those mistakes it still has some elements of the original but with a big touch of creativity.I tought Peter Parker discovering the dark suit was very interresting as it gave him this kind of dark personna nobody would have expect that too happen.His scenes in the cafe as dark spiderman are quite funny,i think that got a good laugh out of pretty much everyone!And i must admit the dark suit is pretty cool.<br /><br />The major mistake they did in the proccess of creating this third Spiderman is that they putted three vilains in it,reminescent of the Batman and Robin movie from the 1990s where the heroes had to fight many villains at the same time,as i recall that did not turn out to be a succesfull experiment.Venom would have been enough to make a movie with alone,and he's probably the coolest villain in Spiderman history.The Green Goblin only appeared in the movie for less than 10 minutes,he wouldn't have been needed.Sandman has quite an interresting story and all but was he really necessary?Besides that flaw its a really good movie,every movie has some flaws.<br /><br />To conclude i must say that this movie was nearly two movies i one actually.Had they put the Sandman's parts for another movie and added more scrip based on it it could have turned great.Even with that i have to say i was really satisfied with this third movie.There was plenty of action and the other elements that made the others so good and succesfull.I must say Topher Grace from cult show,"That 70s Show" does a great job as Venom and i didn't recognize him at all until i was told it was him!Thomas Haiden Church is made a brilliant appearance as the Sandman and the rest of the cast is great as well.I definatly recommend it,even if you haven't seen Spiderman 1 and 2 you will probably have a good time watching this.4 stars,recommended!</p></br><a href="../users/A2JHHYYOOO4DS6.html">A2JHHYYOOO4DS6</a><br/><p>I say the broth is quite alright and ready to be served. This is my favorite of the three. Why...because of the issues faced by both hero and villain alike ...it almost makes them seem like real people. The bad spidey was something else.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco return once again in this third installment of the Spiderman series.<br /><br />Maguire revives his role as Peter Parker/Spiderman.  Peter's life is going very well; he's doing well in school and his relationship with Mary Jane (Dunst) couldn't be better.  Plus, he's just saved the police chief's daughter from certain death.  Now, he's being awarded the key to the city.  Life couldn't be much better, right?  Wrong!<br /><br />Harry Osborne (Franco) still blames Spiderman for the death of his father.  So, Harry's taken on a persona of his own as the New Goblin.  He and Spiderman fight it out over New York, but Spiderman managed to knock Harry off of his futuristic surfboard.  Harry ends up in the hospital with a loss of memory.  For the moment, Harry doesn't remember anything of his encounter with Spiderman, and he and Peter become friends again (or so it seems).<br /><br />Peter learns more about the death of his uncle.  He finds out that the man who was arrested for the killing was not the killer at all.  The real killer turns out to be Flint Marco (Thomas Haden Church).  He escapes from prison and flees from the police, but something happens to him as he's fleeing.  He runs into some sort of physics lab where his bodily chemistry is altered.  He can now assume shapes in the sand and turns once again to crime.  He and Spiderman have several run-ins, and he's given the name Sandman.<br /><br />Peter is also going through changes of his own.  Some symbiotic being has attached itself to Peter's Spiderman suit.  It gives him a new sense of strength and power, but it also takes its toll on Peter mentally.  He's become stronger, but he's also become more abrasive and brash.  Mary Jane has noticed the change in Peter, and she's feeling more distanced from him.  Mary Jane decides to visit Harry, and they share a kiss.  Mary Jane runs from the house, but the kiss has triggered Harry's memory.  He again goes searching for Spiderman.  The two fight it out, and Spiderman leaves Harry for dead.<br /><br />Another enemy for Spiderman emerges in this film.  Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) is a new reporter selling pictures to Peter's newspaper.  J.J. Jameson likes Eddie's pictures better than Peter's and tells Eddie if he can find a picture of Spiderman "with his hands in the cookie jar", he'll get the open reporter position on the paper.  Eddie submits a picture to J.J. of Spiderman holding a bag of money in front of a bank, and J.J. gives him the job.  Peter finds out and claims that the picture is a fake.  The paper finds out that the picture is indeed a fake, and Eddie is fired.  He vows revenge against Peter.  Eddie goes to church and hears noises from the bell tower.  The noise is Peter trying to rid himself of the symbiote.  The symbiote falls on Eddie and soon, he has transformed into Venom; a villian intent on destroying Spiderman.<br /><br />Soon, Sandman and Venom have teamed up in an effort to destroy Spiderman.  Eddie has captured Mary Jane and placed her 80 stories above the ground inside a taxi cab.  Peter sees the events unfolding on television and goes to help.  He first stops at Harry's house to ask for his help, but Harry doesn't give in (by this time, Harry's butler has told him the truth about his father's death).  So, Spiderman goes off to fight the two  villains alone.  Will Mary Jane survive?  Will Harry come to help Spiderman?<br /><br />I thought this was the best of the Spiderman movies so far.  The acting is great and its always nice to have the same actors continue with their roles in sequels.  There is a lot of action and characters to keep track of in this movie, but everything is tied up at the end.  The ending leaves the door wide open for a fourth installment, which I'm sure will be coming soon.<br /><br />I recommend this movie very highly.  Watch and see if Spiderman can defeat the new villians as well as the enemy within himself.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CU4L3OK00M23.html">A2CU4L3OK00M23</a><br/><p>I have been a Spider-Man fan since the early 1980's and have been excited as each of these movies has come out.  They are not 100% true to the comics, but generally that is ok.  Until this one.<br /><br />They have painted themselves into a corner.  With too many villains, no where to go with the love angle, so another girl must be found-at least for awhile-and trying to explore Peter's "bad boy" side, while the minor characters have their own issues to explore, which just muddies the water even more.<br /><br />It is too much to do well, and they do not do it well.  The fights and graphics are well done and the individual characters are done well within their own scope of the movie.  The cameo of Stan Lee was a riot.  But I finished this movie feeling very disappointed.  They can't cram 40 years of Spider-Man into one movie and should not even try.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>I still nurse a grudge against Joel Silverman for mucking up the Batman series by stuffing it with way too many villains in the belief that it somehow bolsters the franchise.  And yet I understand: each supervillain means another toy, another lunchbox, another backpack that gets created.  They are literally worth millions, and to justify the budgets of superhero movies, action figures and other returns add up.<br /><br />But that's a cynical way of looking at it.  What happened to just focusing on making a good movie?<br /><br />Spider-Man 3, as you guessed, fell victim to the same problem.  And that's a shame.  At one point my wife turned to me and said, "you know, this movie isn't nearly as bad as everyone made it out to be."  I agreed with her.  It was the scene when Peter was talking to Aunt May about proposing to Mary Jane.<br /><br />Fifteen minutes later, she changed her mind.<br /><br />Raimi does an excellent job of taking the superhero foibles and following them to their logical conclusion.  In a lot of ways, it's not unlike being a famous actor.  Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) learns that just because he's Spider-Man doesn't mean he can kiss girls in public while hanging upside from a web, ESPECIALLY if she's a hottie (the delectable Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy).  When things are looking great for Parker, Mary Jane Watson's (Kirsten Dunst, seeming a bit deflated in this film) career is tanking.  Sounds familiar, like something you'd read in a tabloid...<br /><br />Raimi and his cast handle all of these issues with grace.  And I don't mean Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock and later Venom.  There are no less than three villains in this film, one being Sandman (Thomas Haden Church playing Flint Marko, and he nails the look), the other being Venom the alien parasite. And we can't forget Harry Osborn (James Franco) as the new Goblin.  At various points in the film, it feels like bad guys just get thrown at Parker while he's driving down the street.<br /><br />Mind you, the special effects are amazing.  This is the first true, knockdown, drag out superhero battle that pulls no punches.  Between Goblin's aerial antics, Sandman's shapeshifting, and the amazing acrobatics of Spider-Man, this movie is so action packed with amazing feats of strength and agility that it's hard to look away.<br /><br />There's a convoluted connection to Marko that at least explains why he's in the film.  But Venom is another story.  He literally drops out of the sky, sneaks into Parker's room, and then takes him over.  The concept of Venom is already ludicrous to begin with: an alien parasite that bonds with people but mimics Spider-Man's powers during the Secret Wars on Battleworld, placed there by a being known as the Beyonder.  Hey, it was the 80s, give Marvel a break.<br /><br />A lot of the back-story is jettisoned in exchange for...no back-story at all.  The parasite just shows up in an asteroid.  It bonds with Spider-Man's suit.  It turns him evil.  For no reason.<br /><br />Other stuff like this happens.  At one point, Osborn threatens Mary Jane, forcing her to break it off with Peter or he'll kill him.  And she does.  When Spider-Man defeats Goblin (and, near as I can tell, killed him), nothing further is mentioned.  Doesn't Mary Jane want to explain what she did and why?  How come the police weren't called, when the first near-death experience with Goblin ends up (realistically) in an emergency room? Don't even get me started on the amnesia that strikes Osborn at a convenient moment...<br /><br />And so it goes.  Sandman is practically invincible, so fights with him are pointless.  We get an interesting back-story about his drive to save his daughter from illness, but then the film does nothing with it.  And since Sandman can fly (news to me), he's like a ghost.  You can't beat him.  Which makes one wonder...why fight Spider-Man at all?  And certainly, why would a powerful immortal-level being like Sandman team up with Venom, a crazy alien nutjob?<br /><br />We don't get our answers.  Spider-Man has an overarching theme of forgiveness, but I found it difficult to forgive the obvious cramming of too many ideas.  I suspect this is the installment where principal actors bow out.  I can't blame them.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) must contend with the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), Venom (Topher Grace), a new Goblin (James Franco), his own dark side, his collapsing relationship with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), and, most devastating of all, a complete mess of a screenplay.  This is a hugely disappointing film, especially after the first two, also from director Sam Raimi, were so good.<br /><br />It's hard to know where to begin.  The Venom subplot seems to have been thrown in as an afterthought, with no attempt whatsoever made to give the character a plausible introduction; it just happens to drop out of space near our hero.  The Sandman's character is wildly erratic; one moment he's a misunderstood man who just wants to help his dying daughter, the next he is vengefully joining forces with Venom to kill Spider-Man, an action that doesn't help his daughter at all.  Harry Osbourne's motivation flip-flops around to meet the requirements of the plot, Peter's dark side is played for laughs, and the angst between Mary Jane and Peter is childish and annoying, with the sadly undeveloped character of Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) merely one more contrived obstacle between them.</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>This is family entertainment!<br />I've loved comic books since<br />I was very young.<br />Here Spiderman comes alive for the third time.<br />As with Superman before him, all his secrets<br />are getting out.<br />It isn't an easy world for a superhero...<br />As usually good special effects, but<br />you can pretty well tell<br />where real film ends and blue screen begins.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Spider-Man 3" precariously balances an excess of plot elements that never come together quite cohesively but nonetheless produce a reasonably entertaining action movie. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is basking is Spiderman's glory and plans to propose marriage to Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), who continues to struggle with her stage career. Flint Marco (Thomas Hayden Church), a small-time crook believed to have murdered Parker's dear Uncle Ben, has been transformed into the Sandman by an opportune accident with a particle accelerator. Harry Osborn (James Franco) has decided to avenge his father by becoming the Green Goblin reincarnate. A self-absorbed upstart named Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) is after Parker's job at the Daily Bugle. If that weren't enough trouble, an insidious symbiotic organism is bringing out the worst in Spider-Man.<br /><br />That's only half of it. This plot is crowded. Ultimately, "Spider-Man 3" continues to explore Peter Parker's struggle with his own psyche in the form of conflicting emotions and desires. But this isn't as effective as the previous two films. The overloaded narrative seems scattershot. I don't think Tobey Maguire's performance is as strong as it has been in the past, but Topher Grace contributes a nice edge as the amoral narcissist Brock, who later becomes Venom, a villain who shares many powers with Spider-Man. My reaction to Sandman is lukewarm, but I love what they did with Venom. It's disappointing that this third installment isn't as visually smart as its predecessors. Dramatic, thoughtful composition is what placed the Spider-Man films a cut above most superhero movies. Still entertaining, but most of "Spider-Man 3" is nothing special.<br /><br />The DVD (Columbia 2007 single disc): Bonus features include Bloopers (6 min), a music video for "Signal Fire" (4 min), Galleries of Sketches, Paintings, Special Effects, Director & Cast, video game and toy previews (2 min), and 2 audio commentaries. The 1st commentary is with director Sam Raimi and actors Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Thomas Hayden Church, James Franco, Topher Grace, and Bryce Dallas Howard. This is conversational but informative, a mix of the actor's experiences and observations with discussion of the collaborative aspect of the film, characters, visual effects, and more. The 2nd audio commentary is with producers Laura Ziskin, Avi Arad, Grant Curtis, visual effects supervisor Scott Stokdyk, and editor Bob Murawski. They talk about shooting the effects sequences, scenes from concept to realization, casting, evolution of the story, and technical stuff.</p></br><a href="../users/A21XVS00AIENLX.html">A21XVS00AIENLX</a><br/><p>Great action.  Good plot.  Cool villians.  A little more sentimentality than I expected.  There are too many tear-eyed scenes.  First Spiderman had the right blend of sentimentality, heart and action.  The second one dealt with some angst, overcoming and great action.  The third put too much sentimentality.  There are legitimate scenes that call for the tears, but the film was rank with weepy-ville.  Peter Parker is crying.  Sandman is crying.  May Jane is Crying.  Harry Osborune is crying.  Puh-lease.<br /><br />Highly entertaining but borderlining on sappy.</p></br><a href="../users/AIRHRV3D8X4J1.html">AIRHRV3D8X4J1</a><br/><p>I have to say Spider-Man 3 was another great addition to the Spider-Man trilogy. I do have to admit I was afraid this movie would not live up to the first two Spider-Man's. I mean those first two were great and how could this one possibly match that? After I finished watching it I can say I was not at all disappointed. I think many people were expecting this to be just like Spider-Man 1 and 2. Spider-Man 3 does take more risks than its predecessors by having more villains than usual, but It still manages to entertain, spark emotion and above all inspire and bring out the kid in many of us. It is like the first two with many of the same characters returning, but where Spider-Man 3 differs is when we get to see the dark side (with the black suit) of Spider-Man which takes the movie to a whole new level. I have to say this movie was AWESOME. This movie truly has a great stand out cast. TOBEY MAGUIRE who plays Spider-Man did a great job as usual and brought emotion to the character that made him more human than any other hero in a comic book inspired movie. The action scenes are amazing and they make you jump out of your seat a few times. All that along with the emotional journey that Spider-Man takes you on, that's what truly makes this movie so great and special. This is one Roller-Coaster ride that I highly encourage any one to see. The ending is also a surprise and I will not give it away, but I will say some people liked it and some people did not, Go figure. I did not buy in to all the hype of this movie, or the negative things some critics had to say. I went to see Spider-Man 3 to be entertained and I was not at all disappointed. With a expected DVD and blu-ray release date of November 2007 this is sure to be one great year for Spider-Man fans!</p></br><a href="../users/A3N8RZSXKN1OR2.html">A3N8RZSXKN1OR2</a><br/><p>Two years after his conversion to Spiderman, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) seems to finally have his life under control.  His confidence in his powers has returned, and New York City is awash in SpiderMania; he's acing his college courses, and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), whom he has loved since grade school, finally recognizes and returns his love.  But there are flies in the ointment still.  His lifelong friend Harry Osborn (James Franco), who blames Spidey for his father's death, now knows that Spidey and Peter are one and the same, and has also discovered that the senior Osborn was the Green Goblin; with the Goblin's mask and sky-sled he's about to unveil himself as the New Goblin.  Peter is confronted with an ambitious rival photographer (Topher Grace) for J. Jonah Jameson's (J. K. Simmons) Daily Bugle.  And the police discover that his Uncle Ben was not killed by the con they had thought responsible, but by another, Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), who has recently escaped from prison and been transformed to a new super-villain, the Sandman.  On top of all this, a small meteoroid that lands unnoticed near the Lover's Lane where Peter and MJ are enjoying a quiet moment together proves to have a hitchhiker--a symbiotic alien lifeform that takes possession of Peter and magnifies all his less attractive qualities.  Besides the usual wonderful SFX (including a splendid sequence featuring an out-of-control crane crashing into a skyscraper) and Marvel angst, this concluding (so far) film in the Spidey franchise has as its theme the importance of making choices.  Will bad reviews of one of her parts push MJ into abandoning her dreams of Broadway success?  Will Peter let the symbiote continue to control him even after he knows what it is and sees what it's making him do?  Will he seek revenge against Marko as he did against Ben's supposed murderer?  Will Harry Osborn agree to help him rescue MJ from the Sandman, or be willing to sacrifice even the girl he once loved for the sake of his revenge?  Even Marko shows an unexpected side of his nature in a climactic scene between himself and Spidey.  This may well be the best title in the trilogy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BE1OKY80FUBH.html">A1BE1OKY80FUBH</a><br/><p>After hearing and reading several reviews I was quite skeptical about this film.  After watching it, they actually helped me in being a bit more lenient on it and thus the three star rating.<br /><br />On the positive side are the special effects that are stunning (even more so on blu-ray) and the plot has some interesting twists that could have made the movie better than the two first ones.  For example the dark side of spiderman or the evolution of his relationship with his girlfriend as they follow different paths in their careers.<br /><br />Alas that did not happen.  The plot remains swallow compared to what could have been.  Moreover the three villains are not well developed- especially Venom who could have been a great asset to the movie.  He has way to small part in a movie that evolves around super heroes and villains.  Sandman is a bit more developed and he could return if there is a Spiderman 4.<br /><br />All in all the movie is not that bad considering the special effects and costumes that are amazing.  Too bad that the plot did not explode to what it should have been.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SYMLB8JSW5VD.html">A3SYMLB8JSW5VD</a><br/><p>This Spiderman was a rushed job.

Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is finally enjoying his life. The citizens of New York City honor Spider-Man for his heroic actions and Peter feels ready to ask sweetheart Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) to marry him. Unfortunately, new villains seek to destroy the web-slinging hero and an alien parasite has attached itself to Peter's costume and changes his personality for the worse. "Spider-Man 3" isn't the best in the popular comic book franchise but is indeed an entertaining superhero adventure that delivers plenty of humor and thrills. There are several moments when its complex storyline and too many supporting characters make this third installment feel long and sluggish. The summer blockbuster features some remarkable special effects and terrific action sequences. "Spider-Man 3" also stars James Franco, Topher Grace, Thomas Hayden Church, Bryce Dallas Howard, Rosemary Harris and James Cromwell.<br /><br />The Blue-Ray release of "Spider-Man 3" is a well recommended purchase. The 2007 summer blockbuster is presented in 2.40:1 anamorphic widescreen format. Its crystal clear picture quality is truly excellent. This is the type of Blue-ray that you'll want to show off in your high definition television. Its 5.1 Dolby TrueHD sound is first-rate with great clarity and intense surround effects. There are over two hours of behind-the-scenes featurettes that focus on the film's production and visual effects. Other special features include photo galleries, Snow Patrol "Signal Fire" music video, trailers, TV spots, blooper reel and two informative audio commentaries by director Sam Raimi, cast members and production crew. Overall, "Spiderman 3" scores "B+".</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>Bottom line... heck, even my kids are bored by the thing.<br /><br />To fully understand why SPIDERMAN 3 was a tremendous disappointment, I had to break it down like this. I went along the timeline of the film and wrote down the times that storylines popped in and how much of each there was... Here is what I found:<br /><br />In a 2:19:00 movie. The venom storyline, apart from the slambang finale that was actually really good, consisted of a :38 scene, an :08 scene, a 2:15 scene, a 3:50 scene, a 2:55 scene and a :42 scene, adding up to 10:28. 10:28? To boot, the venom storyline doesn't take off until the 1:03:40 point of the movie.<br /><br />The Sandman storyline consists of 15:32 of film time. Dramatic scenes and everything.<br /><br />There was 25:57 worth of action scenes, including Goblin, Venom & Sandman... other than the finale, which was slightly less than 22 minutes.<br /><br />1:10:40 of the film was reserved for the romance storyline and other random dramas, like friendship and photography. Peter wanting to ask Mary Jane to marry him. Them going out to dinner. Peter making a jerk of himself at a club she's singing at. Peter telling his Aunt that he's gonna ask her. Peter dancing around like something out of Saturday Night Fever. Rehashing the old storyline of how his Uncle died. Harry Osborn and Mary Jane cooking omelets and dancing around. Mary Jane being replaced from her Broadway show.<br /><br />The 1:10:40 doesn't even include the dramatic scenes that involve Sandman and his plight to save his daughter.<br /><br />Ultimately, the movie has a terrible, no, 'terrible' is too generous, DEPLORABLE flow. Personally, I wanted to see more venom. Yet, I got a little more than 10 minutes of venom in 1:57:00 of movie time and had to wait until the 1:03:40 point for him to materialize. Action scenes were few and far between. Two minute action scenes were broken up by long scenes of emotional baggage.<br /><br />I want so badly to give this movie more than 2 stars. The action scenes, when they happen are really really good. Yet, for the life of me, I can't understand why the creators of this film skimped so much on action. They've made TONS and TONS of money with this trilogy. You'd think that they'd try and reward the viewers who have made them FILTHY RICH... yet, it seemed as though they were filming on a budget...<br /><br />So, bottom line... if you don't mind SPIDERMAN 3... the soap opera, you'll love this movie. If you wanted to see Venom, and lots of him, you'll be tremendously disappointed. Ultimately, there were too many storylines, and you'd think that these filmmakers would have learned a lesson from the original Batman movies. Apparently... they didn't.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>There was just something about the first two Spiderman movies that made them good and watchable. Now I'm not saying this isn't good or unwatchable, but I am saying the director threw way too many ideas at it, and couldn't edit it good enough.<br /><br />My main problem always has been with the Spiderman movies Tobey Maguire. He's got the face of a little boy sometimes, and the hands of an old man. In my mind, he just doesn't fit as Spiderman/Peter Parker. Yes, he's a geek, but at some points, he's too geeky to BE Spiderman. Clark Kent was a hot geek. Tobey Maguire not so much.<br /><br />Spiderman 3 has a lot of special effects, some of the best being the effects creating Sandman, played by Thomas Hayden Church, who is connected to the first movie in some way (whatever could that be?), and throughout the film he is a bad guy. But watch out for the ending he actually turns out good. I wasn't too keen on the bad-guy-with-no-name, who later turns out to be called Venom. It seemed a little too contrived that the black goo just happened to fall on him and create another bad guy. I'm sure this worked out better in the comics but a bit more explanation on screen would be better.<br /><br />However, the movie does have its hilarious moments. The scenes with Bruce Campbell as the Ma?tre d', who fails miserably to do his part in the proposal, with a hilarious moustache. Then there's J.K. Simmons, who plays Peter's boss. He was funny in the first two films, but he comes into his own in this, and practically steals the show in every scene. Especially with the long running joke about his high blood pressure, his temper, and how many tablets he has to take. Definitely a scene I will be re-watching over & over when I get the DVD. "Not that one!"<br /><br />I honestly did not see the point in Bryce Dallas Howard though. OK, bring a new love interest in, but some dumb blonde against Mary Jane? Not gonna work. Apart from evoking the green eyed monster in Mary Jane, there's not really much point in her being in the film. And she's underused to boot.<br /><br />I was forewarned that I would be cringing at one point during the film, and I thought "What could possibly make me cringe in a Spiderman movie?" How wrong was I?! I had my head in my hands, and not only was it a pointless scene, it felt like a very bad parody of Saturday Night Fever. Very bad parody. Accompanied by corny music, Peter Parker thinking he's turned into God's gift to women, complete with groin thrusting, must have been embarrassing for Tobey to film, but I hope it doesn't go to his head. Honestly. It's not an image I will ever get out of my head. I have to admit though, I did think he looked hot with the black suit/black shirt outfit. If his head suddenly disappeared inside the shirt of course.<br /><br />I did think James Franco deserved a bigger role in this film, especially with what happens. The whole goblin grenade to the face was just an insult, and then conveniently getting amnesia. Not good. He is turning into one of my favourite actors, and he is a bit of a good looking guy. But who's gonna be Peter's buddy now? Believe me, if you've got a heart of stone, you will shed a tear.<br /><br />I'm still not sure this was a good sequel to the Spiderman movies, and I have this baaaaddddd feeling they're going to continue the series, but Kirsten and Tobey have all said they really want to move on now. Hey maybe they'd bring in Jake Gyllenhaal instead! That would make it good. But they seemed to focus a lot of Mary Jane's jealousy and the cool special effects. Can't they just let them be happy?</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>I don't care what the critics say, or the comments I read on message boards, this is a good Spider-Man flick. The use of CGI is well done and there are numerous funny scenes to lighten the mood a bit. The only slight negative was that some of the scenes did drag on a bit too long at times. The use of three villains was pretty cool. I liked them all, but Venom could have used much more screen time. He should have been saved for the only villian in Spider-Man 4.<br /><br />Well, with an opening day of around 59 million dollars, you reading this have probably already seen it. If not, swing (pun intended) by your local theater now.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Spiderman 3 isn't as good as part 1 and 2 but it has pleanty of good moments for me to recommend it. It's missing something that the others had. It seems like it has a different screen-writer and I also missed Danny Elfman. When the film was being filmed I remember reading something about him actually never wanting to work with Sam Raimi again for some reason. So he's not back even if you do hear some of his original score here and there. I also think the story is sort of a mess, too much happening it once. It's sorta messy. I read the novel based on the movie before the movie came out and it's surprisingly more solid in some cases. I mean the stuff with the Sandman is better done in it and we understand him a bit more. The screenplay itself isn't developed well. It has it's scenes of emotion that do work but most of them come at the end.<br /><br />  Yes we have scenes with crying and argueing but that can be more annoying than it's entertaining. Kirsten Dunst for instance, she rarely smiles in this movie! She just accuses Peter of stuff through-out and whines about her acting career. Oh of course she gets taken by the bad guys once again too. Bryce Dallas Howard looks her best ever! as Gwen Stacey and she's not even developed much. She's just around to make Mary Jane jealous but the film could've used more of her. She's fresh to the movies and at least is happy and doesn't complain. Plus James Cromwell (Babe) is a great actor but he's pretty wasted as well as Captain Stacy, Gwen's father.<br /><br />  People complained that Topher Grace wasn't built enough to play Eddie Brock. Yes he's mis-casted but that's in style these days, I mean you have Heath Ledger playing Joker in the next Batman film for god's sake. I think Topher does a fine job even if I do think he would've been a great Spiderman if Tobey didn't come back. Through most the movie he has nothing to do but run around with a camera. When he becomes Venom he's awesome and Venom is awesome but he's not in the film enough. When you have 3 villians, Venom should of course take up most of the movie but he doesn't. We have Peter wearing the costume through a lot of the movie and when he does his hair turns black but no one even mentions once how odd it is that his hair keeps turning color back and forth. Anyway I guess that's not that important lol. The black costume is mostly used to show how Peter lets hate take over him and how it's not good to let hate take over. I would've preferred more of Eddie Brock as Venom though.<br /><br />  The film has a lot of too many simple flaws. We're supposed to believe that the Sandman just does bad stuff for his daughter. Yet the script just has him looking at her pic all the time and she's not used the way she is in the novel based on the movie. The Sandman's emotional scene in the end just sorta comes out of nowhere. It was actually done better in the book  since you had the daughter involved. Plus you also had a part in the book where he turns into a sand castle for his daughter. The movie could've used that too. Instead he never gets to have as big of a presence as the Green Goblin or Doc Ock. Plus like I said, I liked Topher Grace as Eddie Brock but he wasn't used enough either. But unlike in the book it's never explained why he knows stuff about Peter and Spiderman now that he has the stuff on.<br /><br />  I admit that the Harry Osborne stuff isn't done that bad though. Eventhough he has memory loss through most the movie and forgets that he blames Peter for his father's death. I've seen too much convenient memory loss in Smallville to wanna see it in Spiderman too lol. But I think the drama involving him is one of the stronger things the movie has going for it. Tobey Maguire is a good actor but in some scenes he didn't even look like he got in shape for the movie. I mean people have knocked Topher's built but he even looked in better shape. Tobey looked so bad in some scenes that I feared for his health. He has some scenes that he's really good and some that his heart barely seems like it's into the movie. Kirsten Dunst seems like her heart is barely into as well. Still though unlike 2 critics on Ebert & Roeper I can't just give the film a careless thumbs down! It's not the best, but it's just not a bad movie either. It's at least a better 3rd movie than X-3 was. But Sam Raimi maybe needs to read more of the comics and try to get his head back in the game because he barely seemed like he was there this time around as well.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>There will always be naysayers to a franchise such as Spiderman's. It's a mega blockbuster and come time for a sequel, expectations run amok. But I am happy to report that the third outing of this arachnid adventure is just what you would want it to be: very decent popcorn, amid some gulpy, wide-eyed sips of Coke.<br /><br />Nothing more, nothing less. Don't read too much if you haven't seen the film, it is best enjoyed with minimum hopes. The visual FX are a labor of love and grandeur, despite the running lament of CGI geeks. I had little idea prior to the movie that one of the villains would meet his biological alchemy. Very well composed (and decomposed).<br /><br />In trying to better what he has accomplished before, the director may have gone over-board by tripling the number of characters and by going for a much too bombastic face-off in the climax, which only amount to the exact opposite: a diminishing effect. But that is offset by the rewards of continuity from previous 'episodes'. There's a heady dollop of good-natured humor, friendship, betrayal, jealousy, love, morality, even some funky moves on the dance floor! Which is fun as it goes a bit beyond senseless derring-do.<br /><br />In the end, Spidey III is a refreshing departure from cardboard caricatures of good and evil. Bad guys are not always dripping in venom (they have a reason to do what they do, sometimes even rooted in affection), nor the good guys in saccharine. Tobey Maguire is effortless as the gentle, goofy Peter Parker, but we see an extra sliver of his acting range as he stretches his character--and his Spandex--when he is overcome by a dark, sinister thingie. Gives a whole new meaning to the expression "getting one's tights in knots".<br /><br />A word for Topher Grace. I am thoroughly impressed by how far he has come from That Seventies Show, to capers such as 'P.S.' and In Good Company, to a sharp, screen-dominating cameo in a Level A blockbuster. And he is equal to the task. His gamble with being the baddest of the bad guys, whose vindictive gene gets the better of him at last, is administered with such flair that one is guilty of hoping he would come around in the end. Does he? I'll leave that for you to find out. While he is at it, he sure is punchy.<br /><br />This is no classy noir but it is spectacular. And while it is studded with perhaps more characters than it may have time to fully develop, it does do its job, and does so with flying colors. Literally.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MYUI8IT6UBUU.html">A2MYUI8IT6UBUU</a><br/><p>In the final chapter of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy, we find Peter Parker finally reaching a fulfilling equilibrium between his normal life and his crime-fighting one, as he readies a proposal to childhood sweetheart Mary Jane. But such serenity is not meant to last, and our masked hero is attacked by foes both old and new. Parker's best friend Harry has again risen to avenge his father, a man made of sand terrorizes New York, and a gooey symbiotic life-form threatens to destroy Spider-Man entirely. With plenty of fantastical action, a heart-wrenching storyline complete with love and revenge, the funniest Bruce Campbell cameo ever, and a special effects-laden final showdown the magnitude of which hasn't been witnessed before, Spider-Man 3 may be the best installment yet.<br /><br />Spider-Man 3 is undeniably an entertaining film. But Sam Raimi, perhaps pressured by the huge fan base or studio executives, has tried to cram too much into the third chapter of this hugely popular franchise. One of Spider-Man's best designed and admired comic book villains, Venom, makes his big screen debut, but it feels awfully small. Focusing mainly on New Goblin and the Sandman, Venom is left to relish in only the last half of the film. His design is greatly lacking from the enormously muscular and grotesque look of the comics. His large teeth-laden mouth and flicking snake-like tongue are drastically toned down and instead he is equipped with a high-pitched shriek. While Topher Grace's acting is adequate, his scrawny stature just doesn't seem to fit with how Venom has been drawn for so many years. The character development for this character is greatly stunted, and by the time Eddie Brock becomes Venom we don't really hate him and his motives against Spidey seem somewhat trivial.<br /><br />On the bright side, Sandman is an astonishing villain to behold and his human side is developed with much more care. Thomas Haden Church portrays Flint Marko with a tender demeanor and an honesty that makes you believe he's merely a victim of circumstance. The premise that leads to Marko becoming a powerful manipulator of sand is a bit hokey, but relatively accurate to his comic book origins. Spider-Man even comments: "where do these guys come from?" The special effects are flat out jaw-dropping. The realistic particle effects and transformations of dirt and mud forming into Church's statuesque face are unbelievably impressive and toward the conclusion when Sandman becomes a giant monstrosity of earth and cement, his roar of utter awesomeness echoes his appearance.<br /><br />Spider-Man 3 does contain the most involved and complex love story of the three, and is a perfect culmination of all the loose ends and various plotlines started in the first two films. The story arc of Harry Osborn and his demented alter ego finally concludes and Spider-Man must try once and for all to mend their fragile friendship. Mary Jane and Peter plan to marry but jealousy and misunderstandings constantly impede their struggling love, and the appearance of Gwen Stacy (the gorgeous blonde Bryce Dallas Howard) further complicates their already murky love affair.<br /><br />Raimi divides the suspense in a few key spots with some truly inspired and outrageous dance numbers. Tobey throws around a few riotously funny moves after Venom's poison takes effect, giving him a cocky self-confidence and the desire to appear a bit "emo". These bits of humor perfectly supplement the tone and help ease the breakneck pacing of the film's action. And let's not forget Bruce Campbell's signature cameo, which easily outdoes the other two in comedic value.<br /><br />With near perfect special effects, interesting new characters, and an intensely complex storyline that converges and concludes every plot point and loose end from its predecessors, Spider-Man 3 is both a fitting finale and colossal blockbuster no Spidey fan should dare miss. Again shattering the myth that sequels can't be better than the original, this final chapter in the Spider-Man trilogy sends off our web-slinging superhero with an adventure befitting the expectations the legion of loyal fans hold for the series.<br /><br />-The Massie Twins</p></br><a href="../users/AZ78HT7H9DVJG.html">AZ78HT7H9DVJG</a><br/><p>I thought that Spider-Man 3 was the best than the previous 2.  I'm glad that Toby did his best in this one as this will be his last appearance as Spider-Man.  Best of luck to the new actor who will replace him.<br /><br />In Spider-Man 1, I could not get over that metallic mask of the Green Goblin.  I mean, really!  In part 2, I guess I just wasn't fond of the whole Dr. Octopus storyline.  Anyways, you have to watch the first 2 in order to fully understand part 3.  But, even if you don't, you won't be entirely lost because part 3 will play some scenes from the first 2 as flashbacks.<br /><br />So, what's happening here?  Spidey is at his all-time high as the residents of NYC are loving him.  Life is just grand for Peter Parker/Spider-man.  He's in love with his girlfriend, Mary Jane Watson.  He's even thinking of proposing to her.<br /><br />However, things immediately go downhill once Mary Jane has been booted from a Broadway play.  She finds solace in Harry Osborne, who is suffering from amnesia, because Peter Parker is too "full of himself".<br /><br />Predictably, Spider-Man finds himself in trouble...not just with one villian but with three!  Venom!  Sandman! And the Goblin (Harry himself).  Plus, Peter Parker is slowly losing Mary Jane.  The question is, can Spider-Man fight them all simultaneously?  Can Peter win MJ's heart again?<br /><br />Anyways, Spider-Man 3 is a wonderful film.  I love how they've added humor at the appropriate time and place.  My favorite part was when Peter was bonding with the Venom symbiote.  He's physically aggressive but at the same time, overly confident with the women around him.  He does these silly little dance movements.<br /><br />Marvel fans can spot Stan Lee anytime, anywhere.  However, I cannot recall if he ever had a line as he had in this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>Much-awaited second sequel of "Spider-man" offers a lot of thrilling action sequences (as you expected), but sadly lacks a coherent story with one (or two, or maybe more) too many characters who should have been kept for another installment of the series. That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy watching "Spider-man 3." Yes, I did, but at the same time while watching the film, I was thinking: "Did Sam Raimi really need two villains to make this film?" Actually I don't think "Sandman" is really a villain, but anyway, Spider-man has to fight this formidable enemy before fighting another one, more vicious and powerful Venom.<br /><br />The cast is all excellent, and the action scenes are exciting. The CGI-created Sandman (played by perfect Thomas Haden Church) is simply great, but I still don't know why some characters should re-appear here in this way. It is not a bad idea to show the tragic background story of Sandman and his family, or the estranged relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane, but the story of vengeful Harry Osborn and short-term memory loss puzzled me, which goes nowhere after all.<br /><br />Add to them, there are Peter's rival photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace, excellent too), Peter's new friend Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) and her father Captain Stacy (James Cromwell). Not only Aunt Parker re-appears to give kindly advice to Peter, but Uncle Parker is also seen again in the flashback scenes, and Bruce Campbell (always welcome) appears again. You need to be a skillful storyteller to handle all these characters, but even Christopher Nolan would find it hard to wrap up all these threads within 140 minute. And don't forget the Venom character which appears too late in the film and lovely Ursula who is totally wasted.<br /><br />"Spider-man 3" has great special effects and great cast, with which they could have made two "Spider-man" films.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"Spider-Man 3" is great! The original cast from the first two are back for the second sequel. Also, some of the original crew from the first two are back for the second sequel, as well. Tobey Maguire (as Peter Parker / Spider-Man), Kirsten Dunst (as Mary-Jane Watson), and James Franco (as Harry Osborn / The New Goblin) are back and lead an incredible cast that includes Thomas Haden Church (as Flint Marko / Sandman), Topher Grace (as Eddie Brock / Venom), and Bryce Dallas Howard (as Gwen Stacy). The directing by Sam Raimi (who also directed the first two "Spider-Man" movies) is great. The screen story by Raimi and his brother Ivan & the screenplay by Raimi, his brother Ivan, and Alvin Sargent (who also wrote the screenplay to "Spider-Man 2" (2004) is great. The music by Christopher Young (who also did the music to a movie that was released as counter-programming to "Spider-Man 3" (2007), that movie is "Lucky You" (2007), which was directed by Tobey Maguire's "Wonder Boys" (2000) director Curtis Hanson) is great. The cinematography by Bill Pope (who also did the cinematography to "Spider-Man 2") is great. The film editing by Bob Murawski (who also film edited both "Spider-Man" movies) is great. The casting by Kathy Driscoll & Francine Maisler (who also did the casting to "Spider-Man" (2002) is great. The production design by J. Michael Riva & Neil Spisak (who also did the production design to both "Spider-Man" movies) is great. The art direction by Christopher Burian-Mohr, David F. Klassen, David Swayze, & Dawn Swiderski is great. The set decoration by Leslie A. Pope is great. The costume design by James Acheson (who also did the costume design to both "Spider-Man" movies) is great. The visual effects by Scott Stokdyk (who was also an visual effects supervisor to the last two "Spider-Man" movies) are impressive and should get an Oscar nomination for Best Visual Effects. This is a great movie that ranks in between "Spider-Man 2" & "Spider-Man". This is thrilling, impressive, and smart.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>(4 1/2 *'s) Mainly for better than for worse `Spider-Man 3' comes back with a vengeance.  Not nearly as riveting as its classic predecessor 'Spider-man 2,' this movie swings ahead admirably enough.  Just when this adventure starts to reek of overconfidence, we find a fresh trek going in unexpected directions.  While 'Spider-Man 2' made our hero a constantly beleaguered underdog, #3 shuffles the deck of perilous contingencies.  Seldom extraneous or convoluted, the peril and story lines are still inventive enough to keep our interest.  Indeed, the shifting developments are at times intense and frightening.  In epic and intricate proportions, this installment seldom fails to awe.<br /><br />We begin where we left off with impending engagement between Peter Parker (Tobey McGuire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and Harry's (James Franco) angst against Peter for his father's death.  At first the rift between Peter and Harry takes a run-of-the-mill amnesia course, but the subsequent developments provide greater vigor.  Meanwhile, Peter's uncle's killer, Flint Marko (Thomas Hayden Church) escapes from prison to become the Sandman, an elusive monster with morphing dimensions.  If one villain isn't enough, then Peter's new newspaper rival, Brock and alter-ego, Venom (suavely and savagely played by Topher Grace) comes to roost after Peter's professor develops an evil transformative potion that even gives Spiderman a new makeover.  (Spiderman`s inner conflict gives us more depth than previously provided, and the startling visual effects are less recycled than reinvented.  Both keep us guessing.)<br /><br />Still retaining characters we love (Peter's aunt still provides badly needed tenderness, and his growling newspaper editor boss is still the lovable curmudgeon) but giving us a whole new venue, 'Spider-Man 3' promises many sequels to come.  Although the tension is diminished compared to the masterpiece of 'Spiderman 2,' #3 is an edgy and excellent edition to the 'Spiderman' franchise.  Sam Raimi's directing refuses to dwell on past laurels, and the sharp editing ably assists eye-popping visuals.  Hopefully, the `Spiderman' franchise will continue to be this worthy.  Penetrating and often startling, 'Spider-Man 3' seldom disappoints.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O536E2YOKK4Y.html">A3O536E2YOKK4Y</a><br/><p>I think so. 2007's "Spider-Man 3" is easily the most entertaining of Sam Raimi's three Spider-Man flicks. The first one (2002) was very good but bogged down by the hero's origin story, which becomes uninteresting in repeat viewings; I also wasn't too crazy about the Goblin's helmet (a minor cavil); the second one (2004) featured a great villain, Dr. Octopus, but was horribly marred by two absurd subplots: one that revealed how Peter's spider powers are somehow linked to his confidence level (Huh? I thought he attained his powers through a radioactive spider) and the other concerned Peter revealing his secret identity to a random group of New Yorkers on the subway with the conclusion that they'll keep his identity secret because they're so thankful for his crimefighting heroics -- Why sure!<br /><br />This third installment takes the good elements of the first two films, minus the origin tale & stoo-pid subplots, and goes into total overdrive. What we end up with is easily one of the most entertaining superhero flicks ever made, not to mention it possesses a wealth of spiritual insights, which is a mark of all great films.<br /><br />Some complain that there are too many villains -- the second Green Goblin, the Sandman and Venom -- but weren't the various Green Goblins (or Hobgoblin) and the Osborns always hovering close by Peter/Spidey to some degree in the comics? As for the Sandman, there wasn't enough depth to him to qualify as the sole villain in a feature film blockbuster; hence, the addition of the parasitic alien that becomes Spider-Man's costume for a brief time and, later, possessing Eddie Brock and becoming Venom.<br /><br />On the surface it appears like there would be too much going on and the film would fall prey to overkill, but Raimi is a master filmmaker by this point and somehow makes it all gel. The 2 hours and 20 minute runtime was necessary for this success. Yes, there are a couple of jarring shifts here and there, but wasn't that the way it was in the comics? One minute Peter's involved in some type of drama and a few frames later Spider-Man's saving the city from the latest nutjob in a costume.<br /><br />Like I said, the film delivers on an entertainment level with loads of action, laughs and melodrama. For instance, when Pete gives into the pull of the alien parasite and becomes the Dark Peter it's hilarious and fun.<br /><br />The film would have been effective with just this, but what propels it into the realm of greatness is the depth of the characters and the numerous potent insights into the human condition:<br /><br />- Harry Osborn struggles with his hostility and rivalry toward Peter.<br />- Themes of humble remorse, friendship and faithfulness are touched on.<br />- The universal conflict of flesh/spirit, id/super-ego is powerfully explored as Peter grapples with his dark side.<br />- What at first appears to be a lame reinterpretation of Uncle Ben's murder becomes an awesome illustration of the power of honesty, repentance and forgivenness.<br />- On the surface Peter Parker appears to be the least likely person to be a hero, let alone a superhero. He's kind, meek and physically almost frail. There's absolutely zero machismo posturing with him (until he gives in to the flesh egged on by the alien parasite). And yet he has no qualms about turning on the daring power when required, and then switching it back off once it's no longer necessary. Simply put, Peter Parker is the quintessential male role-model, a gentle and noble evil-fighting warrior.<br /><br />You wouldn't think such potent themes would be effectively addressed in a mere superhero flick, but you'd be wrong. What made Marvel Comics head and shoulders above all other comic brands was not only their creative characters & action, but their maturity and intriguing explorations of morality and the human condition. Even as a 10 year-old boy I was able to clearly see this greatness in Marvel as opposed to other brands (don't get me wrong, other companies had some good stuff as well, it's just that Marvel was in a league of their own).<br /><br />On top of all this you get Gwen Stacy and Captain Stacy! For Gwen they needed someone with a winsome innocence and a babelicious hotness and Bryce Dallas Howard is a pretty good fit.<br /><br />My only gripe is the constant unmasking of Spider-Man, the Goblin and Venom for the obvious purpose of seeing the actor's faces when they speak. This was annoying and unnecessary.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: "Spider-Man 3" is easily the best of Sam Raimi's three Spider-Man flicks -- it's the most entertaining and it has the most spiritual depth. It ranks with the top superhero films of all time.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>I LOVE the Spider Man first two movies, but I am sorry to report that this isn't very good. And here's why:<br /><br />1. Peter in this movie was not very likeable. He is totally emo, and way predatory when he is in touch with his dark side.<br /><br />2. More than half the movie is WAY too depressing. WTF is with MJ being a total bitch and breaking up with Peter, Peter being depressed for more than half the movie, Aunt May's boring relationship adivce, Peter being consumed by his so-called "Dark Side", and everything being grey??????? Sorry, but that doesn't help the movie. And it doesn't fit in with Spider Man.<br /><br />3. WAY too many characters, most of which are under-characterized and unbelieveable; Venom is pretty much non-existent until the final fight, Eddie Brock has NO place whatsoever, and Sandman is whiny and emo for basically the whole movie.<br /><br />4. The Director is trying to cram way too many things into the movie; way too many charactors, too litle time. there aren't enough fight scenes and when there are, they are lame and only last for practically 1 minute. The reason that the other movies were good was because whilst explaining itself, they still cut the BS and got straight to the action.<br /><br />5. The Fight scenes are lame and totally forgettable, the special effects are awful and yet cartoony, I.E. When the building is almost destroyed.<br /><br />6. WAAAAAAAAY too long!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Overall this was way dissapointing, and as soon as you see the Jazz club scene, you know what else to expect...<br /><br />This is not a good movie folks, sorry.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>Where's the relationship gone?

Why the Dance Sequence, why Did they mess up the role of Venom/Eddie Brock? Why So Long? It could have been something Better. It could have been a Contender! Lets Hope Spiderman 4 is better. No wonder they gave this movie away when you purchased the PS3! Spiderman 2 Was Better, as Was 1.</p></br><a href="../users/AMP7TQRWAIE84.html">AMP7TQRWAIE84</a><br/><p>This movie is the best of the series (a couple notches better than two, but WAAAY better than one). Spider-Man finally gets the girl, thinks about marriage and seems overall happier. He and Mary J. get in a fight in the beginning because she accuses Peter of being insensitive to her Broadway performance critique. Their relationship is kinda up and down throughout. Some really shocking things happen during the course of the movie and it must be known that of all 3 of the movies with McQuire portraying Parker this has the most depth; an intriguing depth that the other two lack. But let me tell you; the trilogy of Spider-Man went out with a serious bang with this movie. It might not be perfect but as far as the series goes it's an all-time high. The action was really good and I disagree when I hear people say that three enemies was too much. Finally, the last few scenes rocked! They were very emotive and if you're sensitive, prepare for some tears.<br /><br />Now I know many have said that there were some issues with this movie but I didn't find too many. It gets really intense at times and you just feel for the characters involved but it really works in the movie's favor. There were also more than a couple of totally light-hearted scenese that balance the more serious matters at hand (Peter's raggedy apartment door, anyone??). This is definitely my favorite superhero movie of all-time after watching it again today (10/11/12). I can't believe I haven't been re-watching it over and over again as it is way better than some have let on. I say if you have any doubts about the series and haven't seen any because you've been put off for any reason, you owe it to yourself to watch one Spider-Man title -- and you'd make the right choice if this was it!<br /><br />4.75 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ARJ16772TKHT.html">A3ARJ16772TKHT</a><br/><p>***Minor spoilers***<br /><br />The third movie in the Spider-man series is not terrible (unless you truly think it was, but this is my turn). However, it tries to be much more than it is. For instance, the first movie had the Green Goblin. The second movie had Doc Oc. This outing has three--count 'em---three villains.<br /><br />Of course, this depends on the way you count the villains. One starts bad but turns good at the last minute. One starts of not "good" but aligned with Spider-man, then turns on him after being forcibly rejected. And one is presented as the escape convict with the misguided heart of gold.<br /><br />That being said, with so many villains whose story needs to be told, the story of Spider-man 3 ends up just feeling too rushed. There's too much story to be told here.<br /><br />My personal preference, if they insisted on making a movie with Venom, would actually be to present the symbiote in this movie, merged with Spider-man only. Then, after Peter realized what it was doing to him, he'd ditch it at the end of the movie, and end on the shot of Eddie Brock getting attacked/assimilated by the symbiote just before the fade-to-black, indicating that Venom would be the main villain of the fourth movie. (Similar to Harry finding his father's Goblin lair at the end of movie 2.)<br /><br />But that's just me.<br /><br />In the end, this movie was a missed opportunity that tried to be too much.</p></br><a href="../users/A1JVSIWDF0WT22.html">A1JVSIWDF0WT22</a><br/><p>Maybe they should have spent a little more of the $300M budget in a decent script. Pathetic sequel with character situations not that different from a bad "Three's company" episode. The dance sequence should be more than enough to lock Maguire a Razzie next year and personally I've heard more than enough advice from Pete's aunt to last me a lifetime. Even the action sequences, so similar to those in 1 & 2 are just not that exciting anymore. I can't believe the same great director and writers of #1 & 2 made this one. I would strongly suggest they hold #4 for a big while, at least until we are able to get #3 out of our system.</p></br><a href="../users/AAEP8YFERQ8FC.html">AAEP8YFERQ8FC</a><br/><p>"Spider-man 3" was fairly enjoyable, featuring a fine set of villains, and a story in line with the previous films, though I do feel the whole "black-suit" thing went on for a bit long and that the Venom scenes (which I was looking forward to the most) were a bit rushed, as was Venom's character development. The ending was a little up in the air in some ways too. A little under 4 stars, I think.</p></br><a href="../users/A6VXZ1EEPRTLV.html">A6VXZ1EEPRTLV</a><br/><p>Spider-Man 3 (2007) could be director Sam Raimi's final contribution to the Spider-Man saga.  The film introduces key characters, Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard),  Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), and most significantly, the alien symbiote, that later creates Venom.  Small time crook, Flint Marko (Thomas Hayden Church), is transformed into The Sandman, and is also revealed as the actual killer of Uncle Ben.  If that were not enough, Harry Osborn (James Franco) makes a not unexpected appearance, as the new Goblin.  There is a lot going on, but even with some meandering subplots, things seem to hold together well enough.<br /><br />While Raimi's films can certainly be appreciated for the technical achievement of successfully bringing Spider-Man to life, from the very beginning I have not been comfortable with the universe created by these films, because it strays rather far from the original comics.  In this regard, the writers did not get many things right, most importantly capturing the essence of Peter Parker.  Maguire's Parker is an incompetent goof, which is absolutely not what the Parker from the comics ever was.  The mischaracterization is attributable to a combination of the script, and Maguire's personality.  Although he has trouble keeping his mask on, Maguire is pretty good as Spider-Man.<br /><br />Kirsten Dunst is a good actress, who plays Mary Jane Watson as written.  Which would be great, except the writers mischaracterized her as well.  The same can be said for characters like, Aunt May, Uncle Ben, Harry Osborn, Gwen Stacey, and Betty Brant.  One bright spot has been the superb casting of the villains.  William Dafoe was excellent but was victim of a horrible costume.  Alfred Molina was absolutely brilliant as Doc Ock.  Thomas Hayden Church, and Topher Grace, and both give very good performances, and James Franco makes a stirring and impressive transition, into the new Goblin.  Regarded as disposable, Raimi continues the rather unfortunate trend of killing off his villains.<br /><br />Under the effects of the symbiote, Parker becomes an obnoxious, self absorbed jerk.  He treats his neighbor Usula (Mageina Tovah) like a dog, uses Gwen to degrade MJ, slugs MJ, blows off Harry face and almost kills him, and never even looks back.  Peter is a hard guy to have any empathy for.<br /><br />Venom's appearance is brief, but Topher Grace makes the most of out of what little time he has.  The special effects for Venom are outstanding.  Unfortunately the same can't be said for the lumbering giant Sandman, who looks like a pumped up escapee from a Stephen Sommers' Mummy flick.  In over forty years in comics, Spider-Man has never had problems with keeping on his mask, the way Maguire does in every film.  It is outrageous how many people have seen Spidey without his mask.<br /><br />As in life, Uncle Ben's spirit, shows only concern for Peter, not for vengeance, or even for his wife May.  The new Goblin teaming with Spidey is a really nice touch, with a fate for Harry Osborn that is sort of similar to the comic.  Likely reflecting last minute script revisions, the film has a rather untidy ending, with Peter forgiving Marko for killing Uncle Ben, and the symbiote's messy exit with Topher Grace.<br /><br />Spider-Man 3 looks fantastic in blu-ray, a film that takes full advantage of the benefits of the format, with lots of cool bonus materials.  The commentary track featuring Raimi, and assorted members of the cast is very freeform, with Thomas Hayden Church, providing some witty comments.  Surprisingly, Raimi's contributions are rather minimal.<br /><br />Spider-Man 3 concludes with no clear future direction.  As of January 2010, Sony Pictures has shelved plans for Spider-Man 4, after Raimi pulled out of the project.  A rumored complete reboot of Spider-Man, similar to Batman Begins, may be direction the series will take.  If this is the end of Raimi's affiliation with Spider-Man, it comes at a good time.  The foundation of Raimi's Spider-Man universe was off from the start, and it would have taken a fantastic story to rehab and reinvigorate the series.  Maguire and Dust are now a little old to still be in college, and the rocky relationship between Peter and MJ, took some major hits in Spider-Man 3.  Hopefully Spider-Man will continue in feature films, in a form closer to the original characterization by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>The Spider-Man films are the zenith of comic book filmdom, and, save for a bit of middle filmitis, and too many villains (but the screenwriters almost reconcile this flaw anyway), this film comes damned close to being the best of the three. Its comic book sensibility (not striving to be `too' real), its writing, acting, and even special effects, add up to an enjoyable experience. Is it Antonioni, Bergman, Kurosawa? No. But, as a comic book film, it doesn't have to be (and, likely, it simply constitutionally could not be, for it is based on an art form for juveniles). Still, it's significantly better than its critics claimed, and this is likely because there is a tendency to subconsciously anticipate failure in such a successful series. The difference between bad critics and great ones is that they don't just anticipate failure, they long for it. I put my expectations aside, let the film play out, and was rewarded. What a concept!</p></br><a href="../users/A146D2LYLICNLS.html">A146D2LYLICNLS</a><br/><p>I went to see "Spider-Man 3" tonight after reading several not-so-great reviews earlier today from local newspapers. So I had some doubts going into the theater. Well I'm sure glad I went anyway, because this movie was a BLAST. The critics need to lighten up. No, it wasn't a perfect film, and if one insists on being a hardass they can nit-pick it and find some valid faults. But overall, it was one of the most exciting and *fun* movies I've seen in quite some time.<br /><br />One of the complaints seems to be that too many villains are in it. I thought this may be the case before seeing it, but I thought the film handled their screen time quite well, even if Venom didn't get to do much (although he does have a very good showdown with Spider-Man during the final confrontation scene). But I gotta say that the Sandman grabbed my attention the most, especially his fight scenes with Spider-Man and others. To me, seeing the Sandman in the final confrontation was worth the price of admission. The special effects for his character were simply outstanding - they were fairly standard CGI for the others.<br /><br />As with the other 2 movies, the scenes of humor were well timed and executed, without compromising the tone of the film. I do wish that Kirsten Dunst hadn't gotten suspended high in the air yet again, because we all know that Spider-Man is going to save her from falling, yet again. But I suppose that's a minor irritation I can live with. Performance-wise, I liked everyone in their roles. We already knew what to expect from Maguire and Dunst, so there were no surprises there. Thomas Haden Church put in a good show as the Sandman. And although I wish they had let Bryce Dallas Howard be her lovely redheaded self, she still looked mighty fine, and I'm glad she got a considerable amount of screen time.<br /><br />IMO the first "Spider-Man" film was decent but not much more than that. And I'd rate the second film along with this third installment as superb, just in different ways. Part 2 was great due to the solid story and overall script. While part 3 lacks some of that, it more than makes up for it with better and bolder action and pure entertainment level. I was originally going to give this 4 stars but decided to go all the way to 5 mainly because I had such a great time with it. Think of this film as the nitro-charged extension of part 2 and I'll bet you'll find yourself more than pumped by the time the end credits roll.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KJ6JAZPH382D.html">A3KJ6JAZPH382D</a><br/><p>"Spiderman 3" falls victim to a common ailment of most hero movie franchises. If one villain is good, then two would be great, But if two would be great, then three would be fabulous! (Think the horribly overstuffed "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790732912">Batman & Robin</a>" or "Superman III.") So while I really enjoyed the third installment in the Spiderman series, I kept getting the feeling that I was watching what would have made two great movies crammed into a single average one.<br /><br />For instance, is Thomas Haden Church's Sandman necessary to this film? Granted he lets the dark Spiderman loose for a bit, but both The New Goblin and Venom get their turns as bad spidey bait. It also sucked points away by convoluting plot points and weakly re-writing the circumstances of Uncle Ben's death. The movie's pace would have significantly improved had the conflicts been more limited to Peter, Harry and Eddie Brock. Since the main focus was on Harry and Peter's attention to Mary Jane and Eddie's anger at losing his girl to Peter, it would have tightened the story if Sandman had been saved for later.<br /><br />The conflict also gives Tobey Maguire a chance to goof around with the role. His moments as Dark Peter Parker are some of the film's funniest (following J.K. Simmons as J. Johah Jameson), and his antics in the jazz-cafe were the ones that got the big reaction in the theater I was watching this. I also found it amusing that when Peter gets bad his bangs suddenly fall down his face and he looks like he should be joining a Fall Out Boy/My Chemical Romance concert.<br /><br />What all this crowding does accomplish is a shortchanging of character development. How Sandman and Venom form an alliance in zero seconds flat is whiplash inducing as is the almost total lack of development in Topher Grace's character. He's brought in so quickly you wonder how he became so angry so fast in his evolution into Venom. Aunt May is barely in the plot at all; Peter's apartment manager and daughter get more significance. Harry/The New Goblin plays a major role throughout, but his character stages are done so abruptly that, once again, you end up wondering what the heck just happened here.<br /><br />This probably won't distract you from all the action, and Sam Raimi again delivers the goods. The flights, fights and special effects are astonishing as ever. Spiderman's suits are as sleek and cool as before, and all the gimmicks will keep your eyes on the screen. So will the obligatory Stan Lee cameo. All told, "Spiderman 3" is not a bad movie, but given that both one and two were amazing, it is still a minor let-down.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M1NNDD95HR0R.html">A3M1NNDD95HR0R</a><br/><p>This movie is a "must see" for all superhero fans, action movie fans, and especially Spider-Man fans.  There were many negative reviews floating around about this movie, but also many reviews claiming it was excellent as well.  The range of different opinions was really surprising.<br /><br />Modern special effects really do Spider-Man justice, and it is clear that a lot of thought went into this movie, as well as a lot of hard work with the computer animation effects.  They are very high quality and truly seem real.  There was so much going on, really a lot to sink your teeth into.  It's complicated but still manages to be understandable throughout.  It's around 2 1/2 hours long, but time flies because you are having fun.  Some complained that there was not enough time with Venom, which is a valid point, but I'm sure that the movie in it's entirety will make up for that.  All I can say is if you fit into one of the said categories, give this movie a chance.  You will not regret it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Spider-Man was GREAT, Spider-Man II was even BETTER, and now Spider-Man III is the CHERRY ON THE CAKE!<br /><br />This time the stakes are raised high with Spidey pitted against Sandman, Venom, New Goblin and possibly his most dangerous rival to date... himself!<br /><br />Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Thomas Haden Church, and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!

If they have a movie with a budget this big, and the fan base to support it, then write a decent script rather then trying to out-do Star Wars by using CGI for 99% of the movie and trying to add 1% plot around it.<br /><br />The movie might well have gotten better after the first half hour, but I will never know because I can not stand the useless and terrible looking CGI with actors who don't cast any shadow or light from their surroundings.<br /><br />Sometimes I can see past the bad CGI, but this one is just overkill, and was it really needed to tell anything in the story? The whole alley way surfboard scene just turned me off completely.<br /><br />I'm glad i didnt waste my money on this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7.html">A2TLLX0ZBMZTK7</a><br/><p>Yeah... The first two Spider-Man movies were decent, I wouldn't own them, but they were decent. I'd put them on if they happened to be on TV and there wasn't anything else on. But... This one? Spider-Man 3? I wouldn't even put it on TV, I wouldn't even give it a second glance. For one, they completely and totally messed up Venom, and you do NOT mess up one of the most popular Spider-Man characters of all time! And, I thought there was too much drama in this one, I really didn't give a crap if Mary-Jane broke up with Peter/Spider-Man or not, it just seemed stupid to me. There wasn't enough action (except at the very end). And, I didn't like how they tried to use three villains at once. Two villains? Go for it! Three? Seems like too much. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>While watching the first two Spiderman films, I was impressed by a few things but also turned off by some as well.  I loved the action scenes and the sly little references to the Peter Parker/Spiderman duel identity, but was never really drawn into the Parker-Mary Jane romance or the development (or lack thereof of villains Green Goblin and Dr. Octopus).<br /><br />Thus, in stark contrast to most Amazon reviewers, I considered Spiderman 3 to be the best of the bunch due to a focus on even more action, plus better acting by Tobey Maguire as Parker/Spidey.  While still progressing the Peter/MJ relationship that screenwriters Miles Millar and Al Gough pretty much ruined in the second film, those scenes take a back seat to Spidey's struggles to fend off three new villains: Hob-Goblin, Sandman, and Venom.<br /><br />With the exception of Parker's friend Harry's Hob-Goblin, which got the short shrift of screen time, I considered both the other villains to be much more interesting than any previous ones.  Sandman actually had some character development that made him a true enemy of Parker, while Venom is probably the most interesting element of the entire Spiderman cannon.<br /><br />Besides that focus on action, though, was a much better performance by Maguire.  Likely do to the very interesting changes he undergoes while battling with Venom, Maguire is able to emote much more wildly/effectively than in the previous movies (where a wide-eyed stare was about all that ever happened).  I especially the scene in which Parker, under the full control of Venom, takes a night out on the town...hilarious!<br /><br />Thus, since I was never really drawn into the relationships/drama of the Spiderman franchise in the first place, I rate this film a cut above the rest for its focus on more action/fight scenes.  I can say with confidence that it did NOT kill the film franchise as many other reviewers are suggesting.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VI2VETB90ZG5.html">A3VI2VETB90ZG5</a><br/><p>I'll open by saying I love this movie.<br /><br />I'll continue by adding that I don't understand why some complain about "too many villains" when that alone captures the very essence of your friendly neighborhood spider-man - he's just a busy guy!<br /><br />All the aspects of the story were powerful and compelling, and I didn't lose interest for one single moment. I loved every minute of "Spider-man 3" and I'm glad that the finished production turned out the way it did.<br /><br />The Blu-ray presentation of "Spider-man 3" is fantastic, both visually and acoustically.<br /><br />It's easily a favorite!</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z44AN3F2IN61.html">A2Z44AN3F2IN61</a><br/><p>At the beginning of the movie, Spidey/Peter has it made. School's going well; the city loves Spider-Man; Mary Jane has a part on Broadway; and Peter's planning on asking Mary Jane to marry him. But you know that can't last.<br /><br />And it doesn't.<br /><br />Mary Jane's show closes after one performance. Peter's former friend Harry Osborne is out for revenge, as the New Goblin, influenced by his father's spirit. The Bugle has a new photographer who's out for Peter's job, and who has a great success plan: prove Spider-Man is a bad guy. An alien symbiote bonds Peter to his suit, turning it black, amplifying his powers, and changing his personality. One of Peter's classmates, Gwen, is getting his attention and driving a wedge between him and Mary Jane. And as if that's not enough, Uncle Ben's real killer, who's only stealing money for his little girl, gets changed into the Sandman, a creature made of (what else?) sand. Oh, yes. Peter gets away from the symbiote, but it attaches to the ambitious photographer, who enjoys the power and becomes Venom.<br /><br />Did I leave anything out?<br /><br />That's really the whole/only problem I had with Spider-Man 3--it was just way too busy. Even at almost 2.5 hours, it still felt too rushed. Plenty of people have written opinions of which parts should have been cut or left out, but I'm not that picky--just get rid of one of the villains and one of the personal-life problems, and I'd be a happy camper.<br /><br />Other than that, it was a fun movie, and pretty much what I expected. Lots of web-swinging and action, plenty of emotional depth and consequences, and really cool special effects. The Sandman in particular had impressive effects--in fact, if it weren't for those effects and the difficulty Spidey had in fighting a creature who can re-form itself, I'd have said the movie could have done without that story line.<br /><br />One thing I do want to mention, because I saw a few reviews criticizing this: when Spidey is influenced by the symbiote, he becomes all arrogant, reminding me of Jerry Lewis in The Nutty Professor. But what I just loved (and this is apparently not a majority opinion) is that, unlike Buddy Love, Peter Parker's alter-ego is not irresistible to women. He's still just as inept and clumsy, and the arrogance does not endear him to people. I thought it was a nice bit of characterization, actually--the symbiote merely amplifying traits (like the suit's power) rather than actually changing those traits.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L9MIIBI7409N.html">A1L9MIIBI7409N</a><br/><p>I'd avoided watching Spider Man in the theatres because everyone told me it was too long, etc.  As a long time Marvel fan - I enjoyed this a lot.  I think this one hit the spot.  Sam Raimi has made a love story cum heroic epic.  The effects are spectacular (topping the previous two shows) and really reflect the comic book world that Spider Man comes from.  The Sandman is pure Steve Ditko, and Venom's effects are brilliantly executed.  Acting wise, Tobey Maguire and Mary Jane are the same - but this time Peter Parker has to deal with a Dr Jekyll Mr Hyde persona and a coterie of supervillains - just like the original comic.  Let's hope there's a sequel...</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>Spiderman is getting a little stale. Him and snaggle tooths relationship is boring.

You would think the makers of this film would have learned from the horror that was "Batman and Robin" that that doesn't work.  The reasons should be obvious to a first year film student: put too many characters in and none end up getting enough screen time to be developed properly.  I think the most probable reason they do this sort of thing in superhero movies is because the most popular superheroes in comics, like Batman and Spider-Man, have so many great and memorable villains in their rogues galleries that, given the likelihood of getting only two or three, or maybe four movies made before the actor playing the hero won't come back to play the part again, or wants too much money, or is just too old, they have to put several villains in at once in order to hit all the ones that just HAVE to be put onscreen.  At least that's the only reason I can think of to explain why they make such an elementary and obvious mistake.  One hopes this movie will reinforce the lesson that when it comes to villains, less really is more, but I rather doubt it will.<br /><br />The other main problem with this movie is also common to the superhero genre, on both big screen and small: unsympathetic love interests.  In romance, the chase is more dramatic than the victory and its aftermath.  When the hero is trying to win the heart of his love the audience is pulling for him, and hoping he'll succeed, and tuning in to see if he will.  Once he's got her, a lot of that dramatic tension is simply gone, and viewers may lose interest.  So the writers, in order to put the success of that romance in jeopardy, and thus maintain dramatic tension, constantly have to come up with things that keep pulling the hero and his girl apart.  The problem is, this can only be taken so far before it starts to make the characters look immature, selfish, and unsympathetic.  You can see it in "Superman Returns" where Lois comes off looking selfish, spiteful, and passive-aggressive to the point where you can't help but wonder what the hell Superman sees in her.  The same thing happened to Lana in the TV series "Smallville" (which is a pity since Lana started out in season one as a very sympathetic character).  Well Mary Jane gets the same treatment here.  In scene after scene she seems positively determined to misunderstand Peter, ascribe the worst of motives to him, and refuse to give him any benefit of doubt.  He tries to comfort her after she gets a bad review, and she bites his head off for telling her he knows what it's like to be mocked and misunderstood.  Before a crowd (and clearly for their benefit) Peter, in costune as Spider-Man, lets a girl whose life he's saved kiss him, and Mary Jane, who as a young, good-looking actress is certainly someone whose work would require her to kiss another man than her boyfriend for a role, and should understand that was just showmanship, but she holds it against him.  Mary Jane instead of calling Peter when she'd feeling a bit down, runs off to spend time his best friend and then initiates a kiss with him, and so on.  This hurts the movie because it makes Mary Jane a fickle, undependable, untrusting, unsympathetic girl that he just might be better off without.<br /><br />The movie was entertaining, for all its flaws. But I hope that if they make a Spider-Man IV, they'll avoid repeating the mistakes of this installment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Our local theatre only has one screen so some movies eventually get shown several weeks or even a month after the release date. But there was a strange rarity when Spider-Man 3 along with Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End where shown the same time everyone else got to. So rather than watching the film a month later with all the disappointment and negative comments, I discovered along with everyone else that the third Spidey installment was just...iffy. Not outright terrible by any means but it just is; it doesn't transcend the genre and go from a good comic book movie to a great movie period like 2 was but rather this was just entertaining but not consistently.<br /><br />The film starts out with Peter Parker/Spider-Man happy as can be with a great girlfriend with Mary Jane who's on Broadway and Peter thinking about proposing. But the attention gets to Peter's head and he becomes a little arrogant and oblivious to certain problems which gets worse when Harry Osborne, furious with the knowledge Parker may be responsible for his father's death, is coming after him.<br /><br />As if they're needed to be more problems, escaped convict Flint Marko, the now-prime suspect in Uncle Ben's murder, has been mutated thanks to an experiment and can change his body's composition to mimic sand. Then of course there's Eddie Brock with a mind for being New York's top photographer, and a strange substance that latches onto Peter and turns him into something no one wants him to be.<br /><br />PHEW! Man it was tough writing all that because as most people have already said, this film is stuffed to the point where the button its pants would fly off and hit someone in the face by now. There's just way too much going on from storylines to villains to scenes and set-pieces yet at the same time the film doesn't have the strong pacing the second film had which is odd to say the least. Each storyline in essence deserves its own film so to boil it all down to one 2 hour 13 minute movie makes it too scattered. Then of course there's individual scenes (I highly suggest skipping chapter 36 to make the film run much smoother) to dialogue, handling of "emo Peter" complete with Conor Oberst haircut to the introduction of Gwen Stacy which seems to be written in as if to say to Spider-Man fans "see? we have Gwen too, now watch us".<br /><br />However, the effects, save a few scenes have definately gotten better, and the slightly darker tone is quite appropriate and even welcome and of course the action scenes are just as awesome as they should be. And despite the awful dialogue (at times), the actors do at least do a respectable job with their roles like Thomas Haden Church as Marko/Sandman and even Topher Grace, an oddball choice, is actually good at playing Brock. This is the kind of film where there's enough great parts but it comes after bad or even laughable parts so you're kind of glad there's at least something good in it.<br /><br />It's obviously not the worst comic book movie; what with Ghost Rider, Elektra and the Punisher out there but in a strange way, this is like the Batman Forever of the franchise: it's watchable sure but man, problems are coming out of its pores.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>In SPIDER-MAN 3, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is finally finding a balance to his life after having gained his spider-like powers a few years ago.  His superhero alter-ego Spider-Man is beloved by New York.  He is thinking about proposing to longtime girlfriend Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). He's also finally learned how to juggle all of his responsibilities between school, work, personal life, and night time crime fighting.  Things seem to be going well.<br /><br />That is until Harry Osborn (James Franco) shows up as the New Goblin and tries to kill Peter.  Their skirmish ends in a stalemate, but threatens their fragile friendship.  Not long after that the police inform Peter and his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) that they have tracked down the second man who was involved in the murder of Uncle Ben.  The suspect is one Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) who during a late night chase falls into a genetic experiment involving sand and mutates into a sand monster. He starts stealing money to provide for his daughter, but is stopped by Spidey.  That doesn't sit well with the Sandman and he promises to make things rough for Spider-Man.  Things become even more confusing when extraterrestrial goo attaches itself to the Spider suit and turns it black.  It gives Peter stronger powers, but also feeds on the darkness of his heart and threatens to overtake and control him.<br /><br />That's a lot going on in one person's life, but that's not all.  Mary Jane is dumped on by the press and fired from her first big acting gig.  Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), a classmate of Peter's, is also making advances and proves a rival for Mary Jane.  Meanwhile, Peter finds himself in a professional photography rivalry with Eddie Brock (Topher Grace). My, my what a tangled web we weave when we first chose Spider-Man to be.<br /><br />Overall, SPIDER-MAN 3 isn't a bad film. It's chock full of action, has a lot of character development, a healthy dose of humor, decent acting, and great special effects.  In fact, the movie has a lot going for it.<br /><br />Yet, SPIDER-MAN 3 isn't as exciting as it should be.  There's just too much going on.  For instance, usually one major villain in a film is enough.  Sometimes you can get by with two, but even then a great deal of character development is lost.  SPIDER-MAN 3 has three major villains who all want Spidey out of the way for different reasons.  SPIDER-MAN 3 also strays more from the original comics than the first two films did.  Turning a comic book into a major motion picture is never easy and Sam Raimi and company did an excellent job at tying everything together. However, in order to get all three villains in and make it all seem semi-plausible, the film strays more than would have been necessary otherwise.  Being a live action comic book film, these things aren't as big a deal if SPIDER-MAN 3 was say, based on a novel.  However, they are still there and drag the film down some.  Therefore, though SPIDER-MAN 3 is a decent comic book action movie that makes a great end piece for this trilogy, the number of elements involved bog the story and pacing down and keep it from being equal to its predecessors.</p></br><a href="../users/AYQF4Z1EQDACU.html">AYQF4Z1EQDACU</a><br/><p>The legendary arachnid superhero is back in his 3rd masterpiece as he takes on Venom, the Sandman and Harry the new Goblin and battles internal conflicts.

Venom is the best villian of the 3 movies and in the comics, Sandman and Harry are great too, don't take that Marvel superhero crap that the 3rd X-Men is terrible or any other 3rd Marvel movie.

I watched the trailers with anticipation and slowly awaited its release into theaters. I heard great stuff about this film. "The best spider man" or "best movie of the year". So yeah, I had some pretty high hopes for this movie. Would Harry try to get back at Parker? Would Parker marry Mary Jane? Would Jamison finally get off spider man's back?<br /><br />Then I saw the movie. Well actually, I almost didn't, because I almost fell asleep half way through. The whole movie was boring from the opening to the cry baby ending. Nothing here was fun; even the bad guys were stupid. How can you have venom in your movie and have it suck? That takes skill, or lack of skill.<br /><br />this movie suffers from Pirates of the Caribbean 2 syndrome, which is basically "bigger is better, so lets jam as much stuff into a movie as we possibly can." yeah, pirates was a complete flop because they tried to jam too much into the movie, and this one is the same. There are too many sub plots and no main plot. i mean come on, first we have sandman trying to get money to save his daughter (subplot 1) then spider man basking in his new fame and glory (subplot 2) then Harry trying to kill spidy and then being put in a coma and losing his memory, so now he doesn't even remember his fathers death (subplot 3). then Mary Jain losses her job and starts hating parker for being insensitive (subplot 4) and then spidy gets attacked by dark matter turning him into a bad guy (subplot 5) then parkers job is threatened by a new photographer (subplot 6) then Harry wakes up from his comma and starts going after peters heart, sound familiar? (Subplot 7). Not to mention the revelation that sandman was uncle bens real killer (subplot 8). Good god, that a lot of stuff. there's enough here to make two or three movies, but instead of doing that they decide to jam it all into one three hour movie (that's way too long by the way. the LOTR could pull that off, but not SM). What is missing though in this movie is a central plot. Unlike the first two movies there is no central plot that the rest revolve around. In the first it was Parker tying to learn how to use his powers properly and fight off Green Goblin, in the second it was Parker trying to juggle being a college student, spider man, his love life, his job, and his friends all at the same time and failing badly. Here it's just a jumble of subplots thrown in together with no logical thinking behind it. What is the main plot? Please, fans of the movie tell me. Was it spidy turning bad? Was it Sandman killing his uncle? What was it? Everything in this movie is just sort of randomly thrown together. After the first hour I got bored and almost fell asleep but couldn't because the lady sitting to me was eating her popcorn too loudly. too bad, I could have caught up on my sleep, but no, I had to watch this movie till the bitter end.<br /><br />And don't even get me started on the ending. First of all didn't the scene where Mary Jane is stuck in the wed and the cad is slowly making its way down to her look kind of similar to a scene in Jurassic Park? Yeah, I think it did. Second, when did spidy become so much of a wimp? I mean really, I know he was outnumbered, but he is a veteran super hero, while sandy and venom were newbie's. Couldn't he have at least put up a halfway decent fight?  I don't want to ruin the ending for you but pretty much think of the most clich&eacute;, corny, idiotic thing that could possibly happen and that is the ending. I'll give you a clue, it involves Harry.<br />And after the battle when everyone was crying and boohooing I was just rolling my eyes. Everyone cries at the end, even sandman. How can he cry? He's made of sand. Now don't get me wrong, I like sad movies (read some of my lists and you can see that for yourself) but the "sad" ending in this movie was so over the top, so corny, so clich&eacute;, that I almost threw my popcorn at the screen in frustration.<br /><br />Another thing that annoyed the heck out of me was that the characters would constantly say and do the absolute worst things they could possible can at the absolute worst times. Mary Jane is going through a rough time, so Parker kisses another girl in public and then doesn't understand why she's upset. Please...<br /><br />Overall this movie sucked. Nothing good here, not even the fight scenes. You should still go see it just because, but don't expect anything like the first two movies. This one was bad, plain and simple. if you read thsi review, whether you agree with me or not, please leave a comment.</p></br><a href="../users/A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA.html">A3V5DUZ5KXPGQA</a><br/><p>Spider-Man 3 has been hyped as the best of the trilogy. I have to respectfully disagree. While not bad, it is the WEAKEST of the trilogy. On its own, its a good film but when compared to the first two (especially Spider-Man 2), it falls short. Here is my take:<br /><br />PROS - James Franco's portrayal of Harry Osborn remains strong here. His "New Goblin" is arguably the best villian in this film though he later turns good to help Spidey against The Sandman and Venom. Also, I found this one to be funnier in spots than the first two. Particularly Tobey Maguire's performance as "Bad Peter" when he acquires his black suit. The dance scene in the club was amazing and probably one of the better non-super scenes in the film! I also thought that the Sandman was handled well. The CG's for him were incredible!<br /><br />CONS - Speaking of Maquire, his and Kirsten Dunst's performances were still good but not as strong here. I blame that more in the writing though. Not enough Aunt May or J. Jonah Jameson in this one too.<br /><br />Bottom line here is this, there was too much stuff crammed into one film. In other words, some of this stuff could've easily been held over for a Spider-Man 4 if not for contractual concerns. I personally would've had just the Sandman and the black costume situation here and held Venom for a fourth film. Speaking of Venom, his character development was very rushed in my opinion. Another film could've fleshed him out much better!<br /><br />Overall, this film isn't a waste of money BUT I'd get it at a reduced price. While nowhere near as bad as some other superhero films such as Hulk, Daredevil (theatrical version/not the uncut), Batman & Robin (1997), Superman IV, Spawn and Steel, it falls way short of the first two Spidey films! I enjoyed the two Fantastic Four movies more than I did this one and that's sad!<br /><br />If you are a family oriented viewer however, then its probably the most moral of the 3 films. Not that the other two weren't virtuious but this one seems to make a point about morality without shoving it down your throat.<br /><br />Anyway, I'd get it at a reduced price or part of that 3-pack that comes with the first two movies. Even with this weak offering however, I am glad I was around to see my favorite childhood comic hero come to life in these three films.</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>If you view this movie as a Spidey versus a Super villain flick, the story is too cluttered and seems confusing.  James Franco is back as Harry Osborn and the New Goblin trying to avenge his father's death against Spiderman / Peter Parker.  Then there is a story revision from the first movie (not uncommon in comic books) that the guy we thought killed Uncle Ben didn't, it was Flint Marko (Thomas Hayden Church) who was trying to raise money for his sick daughter.  On top of that, a new photographer has come to the Daily Bugle to expose Spiderman as a bad guy.  This is music to J. Jonah Jameson's ears, so Parker loses income he badly needs to a kid who is trying to do him in rather than just report what actually happened.  The conflict between Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) and Peter Parker is the core of the film, but it takes awhile to really gather some steam.  On top of all this there is some kind of living goo that crashed to Earth in a meteor and it is after Peter / Spidey, too.<br /><br />So, is that enough stuff for one film?  Oh, yeah, there is also the love relationship between Peter and Mary Jane that has to undergo a crisis in the film.  And it is closer to this relationship that the real point of the film lies.  This is really a story about Peter Parker becoming a man and having to choose what kind of person he will be.  The huge cast of characters are there to present Spiderman with complex choices.  Will Peter choose the self-indulgent path, give up, or choose to be a good man and a hero?  You can guess which it will be by the end of the film, but it is a circuitous route.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film, and the personal crisis story does have its routes in Spiderman story traditions.  However, it isn't quite as much fun as the straightforward good-guy bad-guy smash `em with a building story.  My guess is that they powers that be felt they had done that twice already and wanted something different.  OK.  You did it.  Can we get back to Spidey fighting Rhino, Tombstone, Mysterio, or any of the other dozens of bad guys Spiderman has dealt with over the decades.  We don't need a confusing chorus of them in each film, maybe two at most.  Four is too many.<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI</p></br><a href="../users/A1WUMTJOASEL5F.html">A1WUMTJOASEL5F</a><br/><p>You know what's really mind boggling are the dissective over-needling reviews I constantly read concerning hero movies and animation movies. It's like they are expecting the superhero action to actually fit the frames of real life as we know it. (laugh) Well, if they did that, there would certainly be no men swinging from webs born from the wrists or men flying in from Krypton.<br />Personally I feel a little slighted when superhero flicks take themselves too seriously. Unless we filter in the topical criminal mind, and what makes him tick, we need not bother with the plot at all.<br />OK, so they did that in the previous two flicks, and chose not to follow in the same avenue of what makes a "criminal tick" in this one, focusing more on the relationship of Peter Parker and Mary Jane, which was fine with me. I don't view the superhero cartoons, or even Bugs Bunny with a yearning to find the origin of Yosemite Sam, and what's irking him. I simply accept his formidible non-compliance in dealing with his adversary.<br />Same with the multi villain plot here. Although we do get casual glimps of the villains "beefs", this movie does not dwell on them, and I accept that wholeheartedly. I spent enough time with Doc Ock's woes in the previous film, and I'm glad they chose to make this one more nonsense, as well as fun. I actually laughed more during this Spiderman, than the other ones, who took their subject matter very seriously. OH, WELL. . .it's still based on a "comic book"!

The jazz club scene was cute, but just that--I could have seen it as an extra on the DVD and been amused, but for the most part it detracted from the main storyline at a critical point.<br /><br />This was a fun film to see larger than life on the screen, but I'm not sure Spiderman 3 would translate well to anything but a very high-end home theatre system.</p></br><a href="../users/AUGABW5AS2OXM.html">AUGABW5AS2OXM</a><br/><p>Like the two previous Spiderman movies this was an excellent movie. This<br /><br />has been a series of outstanding comic book hero movies. The characters<br /><br />are just like they appeared in the original comic books. This movie also has some of the most dazzling and outstanding special effects that you will see in a movie.<br /><br />  Spiderman is riding a wave of popularity. He is beloved by everyone and<br /><br />everywhere. His romance with Mary Jane is still simmering. His friend Harry Osborne is still wanting revenge because of his father's death.He<br /><br />becomes the New Goblin. A new villain comes in the person of the Sandman.<br /><br />He escapes prison and stumbles into a physics testing center. He is changed by one of the experiments being conducted there. He now has the ability to change forms by turning into sand. A meteor crashes near Peter<br /><br />Parker and Mary Jane. A parasite escapes from the meteor. It takes Peter Parker over. He turns into a different person. He turns into an ugly person. He even has eyes for another woman. The parasite leaves Parker and takes over Eddie Brock a rival reporter. Brock turns into Venom an evil villain.It falls upon Spiderman to defeat all of these forces of evil. This makes for an action packed movie.<br /><br />  This is definitely one of the biggest movies to come out this year. If<br /><br />you miss it shame on you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>Being an enormous fan of Spiderman and greatly enjoying the first two films, I looked forward in anticipation to this film.  I was greatly disappointed.  There was just too much going on in this film.  Where Doc Ock and the Green Goblin were fascinating villains with powerful performances in the other films, the Sandman was a very dry character and Venom was comical like Danny Devito's Penguin in the Batman movie.  Additionally, Peter Parker's romance with Mary Jane was all over the place and never properly resolved in the end.<br /><br />The best part of the movie is the first battle between Spidey and Harry in his Goblin gear (though it is never explained how he mastered all the equipment and had a much bigger arsenal and better glider than his father).  Their succeeding conflicts do not have the same excitement.<br /><br />J. Jonah Jameson's character is reduced to a much smaller role than the other movies and I was expecting more from Doctor Connors and the University in this film.  Even Aunt May is reduced in this movie and her only good moment is when she says that she would not take revenge on Ben Parker's killer and would be happy if something happened to him.<br /><br />I put this film just slightly below the Ben Affleck Daredevil film.  Though the box office has been great so far, I think it will lose out on the repeat business from audiences (I saw the first two films in the theater three times each).</p></br><a href="../users/A2XQ48481DIO80.html">A2XQ48481DIO80</a><br/><p>oh my god...............why did these producers do venom this way? i mean.......this movie was a major disappointment! venom deserved his own movie with spiderman like boring goblin and dr oct! everybody who came to the movies had on venom shirts and everything, and we all left the movies shaking our head like....what happened? venom was completly nothing like the comic's! his role was short,and he even didn't introduce his self as venom! but other then the let down to all of venom fans,the movie was still a good movie! it had alot of humor,romance,great battles,and a little to much crying!</p></br><a href="../users/AWSYTZ2I2MW0V.html">AWSYTZ2I2MW0V</a><br/><p>the story of this spider mas 3 is really confusing...the movie really fail to bring VENOM to the story, and the sand man is like a crying baby figure....Not a good one...Wait for the next one with the LIZARD...</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>The controversy sparked by my recent raving of a certain Batman movie has caused me to dig up this atrocity and give it another watch.  I had to borrow it from my Spider-Man obsessed brother-in-law for I do not own this movie (nor will I ever).  I think it's important, before I get into discussing why I loathe this movie as I do, to set you up with my feelings going in, so you won't label this a review by a disgruntled Spider-Man hater who expected to rip it apart walking in.  I am not `Team Batman' or something like that; for it is not that simple.  I am simple `Team Good Movie' and this just doesn't fall into that bracket for me.<br /><br />Oh, and MKIA, this is all for you ;-)<br /><br />So, to set things straight; and am a total Spider-Man fan.  Growing up he was my favorite superhero ever and I collected the comics and had all the trading cards and played with the action figures and so when the original `Spider-Man' movie was released I went insane with excitement.  While I felt it was a bit long in areas I totally loved the movie and saw it three times in the theater.  When `Spider-Man 2' was released I bought my tickets almost a week in advance and showed up at the theater an hour early and was blown away by how amazing the movie was.  It was smart and intense and brilliantly directed and acted.  It was the perfect superhero movie, and I still consider it one of the best superhero movies of all time; maybe even the best.  Last year there were a slew of trilogies ending, all of which I was excited over.  `Pirates of the Caribbean' was ending and `Shrek the Third' was being released and of course there was `Spider-Man 3' and of the three this was the one I was most excited over.<br /><br />It was going to be amazing.<br /><br />Since seeing this film I have come to affectionately refer to it as `Spider-Mess 3'.  Okay, so maybe not so affectionately, but whatever.  I will state this before getting into the film also.  I understand that Spider-Man is not a dark character, so don't for one second even begin to conclude that I don't `understand' this hero; I know him very well.  I also know that Venom is one of the darkest characters in the Marvel universe and that the whole symbiote storyline was Spider-Man's darkest hour.  Just know that I know that and you should too before watching this film.<br /><br />My main issue with `Spider-Mess 3' is that it is, well, messy.  There is so much going on that Sam Raimi fails to get a firm grasp on what he is trying to portray.  There are a slew of villains who all have their own agendas but their agendas are all thrown into one pot to stew; and on top of that you have Peter Parker's personal life, which is in shambles, and his relationships with not only Mary Jane and newcomer Gwen Stacy but also his best friend who now wants to kill him because he knows that he is Spider-Man and blames him for his fathers death.  The movie is barely over two-hours which seems like a lot of time, but it isn't if you want to do this story any real justice.  Instead, the film seems rather rushed and thrown together, especially in the ridiculous ending which made me so aggravated I wanted to get up and leave the movie altogether.<br /><br />Like I mentioned earlier, Spider-Man is not a dark character and that is what made the first two movies so delightfully entertaining.  Raimi understood how to take the stylized world of Spider-Man and make it deep and meaningful without making it dark and brooding.  I know that this is not Batman, who has always been a darker character (unless you include the mockeries that have been made of him in the past; i.e. `BAM' and `POW' and Joel Schumacher).  The problem is that Raimi, in this installment, made a mockery of `Spider-Man', ridiculously overplaying the `fun' aspect of the film and sacrificing the intelligence.  There is no balance here.  Stripping the character of all dignity he made the evil of the symbiote play more like a arrogant frat-boy than anything else, making it a joke.  If you take it for comic relief you can justify it, but it deserves no justification.  This was Raimi's chance to explore that dark side to the story, but he opted for the childish way out and failed miserably.<br /><br />Another major issue that I have with this film is the special effects.  `Spider-Man 2' especially was so rich with visuals that I felt walking out that it would never be topped.  It was stunning to watch, mostly because nothing looked like a video game.  It was high speed action from start to finish but it never looked corny or `fake'.  The opening sequence in `Spider-Mess 3' with Spider-Man fighting Harry Osborn through the ally is horrible.  It was so fake looking, like a really poorly made videogame.  My best friend looked at me and rolled his eyes and said "should he leave now?" and I wish that I had conceded right then and there.  Even the freefall scene where Spidy rescues Gwen Stacy is horrible animated.  They would have been better off making this a cartoon.  Sure, the imagery of the Sandman is impressive in parts, but the lazy way they went about the ridiculous ending with Sandman looking like Kirby was just aggravatingly bad.  I wanted to bang my head against a wall, but I was in the middle of the theater (always have to sit in the middle) and there was no wall within reach.<br /><br />It was just a mess; thus the name `Spider-Mess'.<br /><br />Thankfully Tobey Maguire (inspired casting if there ever was one) continued to make Peter Parker a three-dimensional character and breathe whatever life he could into this interesting failure.  Kirsten Dunst also continued with some nice character development, and Topher Grace is just wonderful here as Eddie Brock; although it is sad what they did with Venom, making him an afterthought and just discarding him like he wasn't important when he really should have had his own movie.  Thomas Haden Church is decent here, but the film never really gets under his skin.  He's just your token bad guy who is really not so bad.  James Franco is horrible, but he was horrible in the first two also.  People are raving him as an actor now that he was in `Milk' this year, but I have yet to see it so to me he is still a terrible actor.  Bryce Dallas Howard is underwhelming to say the least, but I didn't expect a whole lot.<br /><br />This should have been a great movie, but sadly it isn't even a good one.  It is mediocre at best, and at times that feels like generosity on my part.  Yes, I loathe this messy film; not just because it is just plain bad but also because it ruined what had the potential of being the best `trilogy' of all time.  The first two films built so much promise, but this debacle just threw it all away.<br /><br />I don't have the heart to give it an F so I'll settle for a D.  If it weren't for the acting I would be forced to give it an F, but you can thank Maguire and Dunst (and especially Grace) for that extra star.<br /><br />Will I see `Spider-Man 4' if there ever is one?  Yes.  Will I walk in expecting greatness?  Yes, since Raimi has a lot of atoning to do, and I think he knows it.  Will I be shocked if it turns out to be a nightmare?  Not after this I won't.</p></br><a href="../users/AIRHRV3D8X4J1.html">AIRHRV3D8X4J1</a><br/><p>I have to say Spider-Man 3 was another great addition to the Spider-Man trilogy. I do have to admit I was afraid this movie would not live up to the first two Spider-Man's. I mean those first two were great and how could this one possibly match that? After I finished watching it I can say I was not at all disappointed. I think many people were expecting this to be just like Spider-Man 1 and 2. Spider-Man 3 does take more risks than its predecessors by having more villains than usual, but It still manages to entertain, spark emotion and above all inspire and bring out the kid in many of us. It is like the first two with many of the same characters returning, but where Spider-Man 3 differs is when we get to see the dark side (with the black suit) of Spider-Man which takes the movie to a whole new level. I have to say this movie was AWESOME. This movie truly has a great stand out cast. TOBEY MAGUIRE who plays Spider-Man did a great job as usual and brought emotion to the character that made him more human than any other hero in a comic book inspired movie. The action scenes are amazing and they make you jump out of your seat a few times. All that along with the emotional journey that Spider-Man takes you on, that's what truly makes this movie so great and special. This is one Roller-Coaster ride that I highly encourage any one to see. The ending is also a surprise and I will not give it away, but I will say some people liked it and some people did not, Go figure. I did not buy in to all the hype of this movie, or the negative things some critics had to say. I went to see Spider-Man 3 to be entertained and I was not at all disappointed.<br /><br />Spider-Man 3 Two-Disc Special Edition DVD, Two-Disc Blu-ray<br /><br />DISC ONE Special Features:<br /><br />* Digitally Mastered Audio and Video<br />* Audio: English Dolby True HD 5.1, English PCM 5.1 (Uncompressed), French, Spanish, Portuguese, Thai 5.1 (Dolby Digital)<br />* Subtitles: English, English SDH, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Korean, Thai, Chinese Mandarin, Chinese Cantonese<br />* Bloopers<br />* Photo Galleries<br />* Snow Patrol Music Video<br />* Audio Commentary with Director Sam Raimi and Cast Members Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Thomas Haden Church, Topher Grace, and Bryce Dallas Howard<br />* Audio Commentary with Producers Laura Ziskin, Avi Arad and Grant Curtis, Editor Bob Murawski and Special Effects Supervisor Scott Stokdyk<br />* Closed Captioned<br />* Bonus Previews<br /><br />DISC TWO Special Features:<br /><br />* Digitally Mastered Audio and Video<br />* Audio: English, Spanish 5.1 (Dolby Digital).

Too many characters, not enough character development, too long, you know something along those lines. Although 3 villains may seem like too many it didn't feel overcrowded. In this third segment Peter Parker deals with so much but don't fear because spidey appears or does Venom. In the beginning it's all about Peter Parker and how big his ego is getting.<br /><br />Everybody loves Spider-Man; he took care of his school and work problems, and best of all he has Mary Jane. What more could Peter ask for but during his short period of joy three things are in the process of attempting to destroy Spider-Man. The first is of course the New Goblin (Harry Osborn) who wants revenge for what Spider-Man did to his Father. The second being Flint Marko who just escaped from prison and eventually becomes the Sandman. Parker's third problem is that Venom just landed on earth and is looking for a host preferably a Spider-Man.<br /><br />A huge series of events occurs after these three including one at the end that is hard to believe but will excite many. After thinking about how the film began and ended I understand how some people feel. I think that Spider-Man 3 is an amazing movie but it will create problems for the Spider-Man films to come, that's if there will even be future films. So much drama is added to all these films because of Mary Jane and I imagine that her damsel in distress act will get old quick. Without her these films don't have much of a story or a heart, they wouldn't be able to have a deep story. They need something else other than Mary Jane, how long will she hold up because she is and will always be the target but that is his one weakness so I guess it's cool for now.<br /><br /> Good bad villains were used in this especially the popular venom. I can only imagine that should there be a 4rth film that Carnage is next up to fight. The films pacing was pretty good, good suspense and great action, this may have been the most exciting of the three. The cinematography was great, acting was good, and the fight sequences were on point. The biggest problem with Spider-Man 3 has to be that the usage of the villains went a little wrong but because these characters are not exactly human there is so much that can be done with them in the future. Where do you think Carnage comes from? There would be no him without Venom. Spider-Man 3 is a great film that will be enjoyed by the average moviegoer. Comic fans may get a tad bit irritated but hey you can't expect them to keep everything the same.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M.html">A2LW5AL0KQ9P1M</a><br/><p>Comic-book fans will have little trouble following the unusually large cast of characters (and their entanglements); nonetheless, fans of the films alone may find themselves a little overwhelmed: Mary Jane Watson v. Gwen Stacy, Peter Parker v. Eddie Brock, Spidey v. Venom, Spidey v. Sandman, Spidey v. New Goblin. The uninitiated may need to bring a notepad! Likewise, comic-book fans will not mind the "uncomfortable" tension (in fact, many will enjoy it), but fans of the films alone might find it nearly unbearable. Now, Raimi tries to inject humor to deflate the film's tension, but it frequently leaves the viewer (even fans of the comic-book) more perplexed than amused. For example: it is really bizarre to see Venom's "emo" affect on Spidey ... his black eyeliner, black sweeping hair, and black dress shirts ... like he just fell out of a "Panic! at the Disco" video. Certainly, comic-book enthusiasts are familiar with this this "dark side" trope (like red kryptonite's effect on Superman), I personally wish it was done with a little more finesse (something that might stand the "test of time").<br /><br />Now for some points on which we all may agree (maybe!) Christopher Young's compositions undermine Raimi's intent. Dramatic battles are completely undercut by his decidedly undramatic score. On a positive note: the acting has remained fairly faithful to the previous two films. Maguire does the best he can with the whiplash script, Franco succeeds in his complex role, and Dunst does a perfectly adequate job. Of course, J.K. Simmons and Ted Raimi rock ... and Bruce Campbell shines (what else would we expect?!) And, needless to say, it is always great to see Stan Lee!!<br /><br />Some will find that the conclusion is a little too "clean" (I, for one, agree with that assertion). Nonetheless, it is crucial to note that comic-book fans expect this ending ... it is faithful to its conventions.<br /><br />Like many of the reviewers here, I was relieved when the credits appeared. It felt about an hour too long, relied too heavily on awkward battle-scenes, failed to develop characters, and "took the easy way out." And yes, IMDB has Spiderman IV slated for 2009 ... so let's hope Raimi returns to simpler, more intimate plots (if he elects to sign-on for the project!!)<br /><br />If you're are a fan of the comic-book (or even just the films), see it!! Then return here and weigh-in on the debate!!</p></br><a href="../users/AHBNPMHDWZ7SB.html">AHBNPMHDWZ7SB</a><br/><p>I want start off by saying that I like this movie. Probally more than you do. With that said, I'll also add that it does serve its purpose, which is to prove that any Spider-Man movie will have great special effects, fine character development, okay acting, and make a shitload of money. Spider-Man 3 is a good film in its own right, but only a decent one when put in the tall dark shadow of its amazing, and incredibly revolutionary predecessors. It does not add much of value to the franchise, aside from introducing some of the most popular characters in Spidey's publication history. That said, those characters aren't given the attention and respect they deserve. They feel more like late additions that were shoehorned in. Overall the movie was not terrible though. It was definitely better than both of the Fantastic 4 movies, Ghost Rider, Elektra, and Daredevil, as well as some other less than savory comic book adaptations. The only thing that really held this movie down were the, not one, but two unnecessary dance scenes, and underdeveloped characters. The worst of the two dance scenes was Peter walking down the street like he was in a music video. The second dance scene reminded me of the jazz flute scene in Anchorman. That should never be. Those scenes made me feel like Sam Raimi was too comfortable with the fact that the movie would make alot of money, and there was no major competition in the superhero/comic book movie department, besides a few hits and a couple of upcoming challengers.<br /><br />That may have been passable in the summer of 2007, but now we have The Avengers saga and The Dark Knight trilogy that have set the bar so high that movies like them should be treated with the utmost respect and care. The addition of Gwen Stacy seemed rather pointless to me, unless they planned on ellaborating on the love triangle between her, Peter, and Mary Jane from the comics in later installments that never came to fruition. The running time was noticably longer than the previous two films, and it felt like a bloated Thanksgiving turkey. There's no reason the two dance scenes should have made the final cut. Some editors and directors don't understand what truly qualifies as a "Deleted Scene". Aside from the dance scenes, perhaps the biggest issue I have with this film is the treatment of my all-time favorite Spidey villain, Venom. Venom was so obviously a late addition to the script that it made me mad. And in addition to that, he was not the towering, manacing presence that we know him as. I must admit though, I loved the wonderful, yet very predictable team-ups of Spider-Man and the New Goblin versus Sandman and Venom. That really brought something to the movie when it was in desperate need of a kick-start. Spidey 3 was not the disaster it has so often been called by geeks and armchair critics alike, but it wasn't an achievement either.<br /><br />Now for the Blu-ray treatment of this rather mid-level, if slightly above average comic book film. Simply put, it's reference quality. The audio and video transfers are pretty much flawless. Unlike the re-releases of the first two films, this one actually loses great extras that were on the first releases. Because of that, I have to dock it considerably in the extras department. All said, I Recommend it, but get the first release.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>Like the other Spider Man movies, the characterization is strong. In this movie we see the struggle between Peter and Mary Jane over his fame as Spiderman as she struggles with her own job/career. We also learn a couple of surprising things, including what really happened with Uncle Ben. Overall a really great movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A33PNAQ33DGBJG.html">A33PNAQ33DGBJG</a><br/><p>This is the best one made so far. The love triangle was a little weird but the rest of the movie was great.</p></br><a href="../users/AKT8TGIT6VVZ5.html">AKT8TGIT6VVZ5</a><br/><p>Of the three Spider-Man films, "Spider-Man 3" has the most intriguing storylines, resolving some of the plot threads left dangling from the previous films with regards to the relationships between Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) and Harry Osborne (James Franco). Indeed, when the film revolves around their friendships, it conjurs up some of the most magical movements in the three films I have seen for these three distinctively intriguing characters. But of course "Spider-Man 3" is more than a fast-paced action adventure thriller involving three friends; this time it offers three - perhaps four - villains who become worthy opponents of Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire). But it's three villains too many, since none of the villains truly rise to the epic proportions of the original Goblin (Willem Dafoe) or Doctor Octopus (Alfred Molina) in the two previous Spider-Man films.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G8IR6ENZSQHF.html">A2G8IR6ENZSQHF</a><br/><p>By "most disappointing movie of the summer," let me clarify that "Spider-Man III" was not the worst movie of the summer by any means, but in terms of the quality we were expecting compared to the quality we received, it definitely is at the bottom of the list.<br /><br />Well, I saw it, partly because my ex-girlfriend had some free tickets and partly because I had to pass by the theater anyways because it was on the way to the library.  And I can say that "Spider-Man III" instantly made the list of one of the year's most disappointing films.  The film is so mediocre that it will immediately make you want to watch "Spider-Man I and II: They Were Better" over again, just to regain your pleasant memories of the franchise.<br /><br />Well, I guess there's some fun to be had with "Spider-Man III," but it's a pale shadow of what's come before.  What's wrong with the film?  The first problem is that it tries to cram way too much into its 140-minute running time.  Not only is Spider-Man fighting two villains to begin with, he's also having to deal with an evil alien substance (which came from God knows where) that briefly turns him evil.  Then, he gets this substance off only for it to possess the character of a rival photographer.  So Spider-Man is fighting three villains, in addition to having to deal with a surprisingly whiny Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst, looking as weepy and helpless as ever).  With all these subplots going on, none of them ever quite gains momentum, and some simply stop in mid-sentence.<br /><br />The plotting alone would have sunk the film to a good degree, but there is a lot of other awful stuff happening.  First, there's the acting.  As mentioned earlier, Dunst is little more than a screentime eater.  Tobey Maguire is good as the normal Spider-Man/Peter Parker, but is jaw-droppingly godawful as their evil alter ego.  He reminded me of Hayden Christiansen in "Attack of the Clones" more than a terrifying menace.  Hayden Church and Franco are OK as Sandman and Goblin (respectively), but Topher Grace as Venom gives one of the worst performances in a comic book film this decade.  He plays Venom with all the cheesy menace of a Fantastic Four villain, and his appearance immediately took me out of the film.<br /><br />Then there's tonal problems.  Parts of the movie are as campy as anything in "Batman and Robin," (especially the increasingly awful one-liners) while others are similar in tone to a soap opera, making for a bizarre contrast that never fits together.  Perhaps most irritatingly, there are serious gaps in logic.  Why is Sandman not shocked at all that he's suddenly turned into a Sandman?  Since when did Harry Osbourne's butler become a genius?  Why can Sandman withstand the pummeling of a speeding train but not two small rockets?  Doesn't Harry forgive someone awfully fast that blew half his face off?  Doesn't Sandman change his mind about Spider-Man awfully quickly?  And Mary Jane...<br /><br />I'm going to stop here, to try to not give away too much.  This is definitely a major disappointment, on the level of "X3."  Its studio is obviously panicky over its financial performance, as it was quick to release polls that showed how much people "liked the film."  They're covering up something, as I have yet to meet anyone that has said anything more positive about it other than, "Well, it wasn't as good as the first two, but it still entertained me."  So, if you feel you must see it, beware to lower your expectations beforehand.  Otherwise, you face crushing disappointment.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>This film had awfully big shoes to fill with the highly successful Spider-Man 2 which is arguably the best comic-book film of all time.  One can't fault the spidey team for trying to be ambitious here, but they just can't exceed, let alone match, their previous effort.  This film is extremely satsifying and deserves to be the blockbuster that it is with its record setting $148 million opening weekend, outdoing Pirates 2 the previous opening weekend champ.  Pirates 3 just missed outperforming Spidey 3 by about 10 million recently; therefore, Spidey 3 reigns champ for now on opening box-office revenue.<br /><br />One has to consider the pressure on this team to continue a story in which they obviously have great affection and in addition to living up to great expectations, these folks also had to heavily consider that this could be the last Spider-Man film as both Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst have made it very clear that they want to move on past Spider-Man before it wrecks their careers like the superhero actors of the past.  This may explain the overly complex storyline, the introduction of Gwen Stacey (for future romance should Dunst walk), multiple villains (under the notion that more is always better), and the over-reliance on special effects (which are outstanding).  It's all a bit too much even though it is all entertaining, but if this is to be the last Spidey film, they wanted to give it all they had.  Too bad it just isn't as good as their last effort, but it is still an outstanding film and great popcorn fun.  You will have a blast with this film if you lower your expectations just a bit.  I left the theater very satisfied.<br /><br />Some Strengths: The Sandman effects are outstanding and manage to emote great sympathy for this character who is skillfully played by Thomas Haden Church of TV's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ELIZZM">Wings</a> and the hit film <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007VZB7E">Sideways</a>.  The black blob effects are really spooky.  Kudos to James (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F6IOD4">Annapolis</a>) Franco as Parker's best friend.  He was outstanding and believable the entire time.<br /><br />Some Weaknesses: Too ambitious and too contrived.  Spidey being taken over by the black blob wanders back and forth from weird and haunting to sensationally funny to the point of looking like a Saturday Night Live parody of Saturday Night Fever.  It became laughably distracting to an otherwise good storyline.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I49HL6XR62DI.html">A3I49HL6XR62DI</a><br/><p>Here it is, short and sweet (all you need to know): Spiderman 3 is worth seeing for the brilliant performance of Thomas Haden Church (Sideways) as the Sandman. The Sandman special effect is terrific. However, this film suffers from the following: 1. Too many super heroes and villains. You can't tell them apart without a scorecard. Goblin Jr. is way too much like Bruce Wayne. You just want to slap Topher Grace's irritating little bad guy. 2. Overacting by Tobey Maguire (the evil spiderman persona is just too much). 3. Too much Mary Jane Watson (yikes, she even sings in this one). 4. Confusing plotline. 5. Way too long; at least a half hour should have been discreetly edited. 6. Comic schtick that falls flat. The scene in the restaurant where Peter is trying to ask Mary Jane to marry him with comic action in the background is excruciating. That's it. The Spiderman franchise is in real danger of going the route of the original Batman films: too many villains, dumb comedy and painful overacting. And, oh yes, Aunt May is so sweet you will want to toss your popcorn.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9V37MS6QY8D.html">AE9V37MS6QY8D</a><br/><p>Being a long-time fan of comics, I secretly look forward to releases of movies based on comics -- no matter what the subject. And while most comic book movies in the past have been shredded to pieces by a majority of critics, the comic book movies today are often crafted so well that they most often receive critical acclaim. Case in point, 2002's "Spider-Man." Everyone loved the origin story of Peter Parker and his struggles of responsibility with his power and trying to lead a normal life. Movie and comic geeks drooled over how well the movie stayed fairly close to the original comic. And usually I'd be with them. However, the first "Spider-Man" movie didn't "wow" me (I liked "Spidey 2" more), say, the way the original 1989 "Batman" movie did. Maybe it was because I've always been a bigger fan of Batman than I have Spider-Man, but, regardless, I just thought Batman was a better movie. Now comes the part of this review where you, the reader, say, "Are you kidding me? Spider-Man stayed more true to the comic and appealed to a much broader audience!" Well, of course Spider-Man appeals to more people, he's your everyman. I mean, seriously, who can relate to an orphaned kid who grows up to be a billionaire playboy? Not many. But that's what I loved about Batman; it was easier for me to accept that story of someone that insanely rich becoming that character as opposed to some dorky kid -- which I was myself in high school -- gaining some superpowers from a spiderbite. I mean, dorky kids don't get those powers and they don't get the girl. I did go on to write a novel that followed along those same lines of an outcast obtaining a "superpower" as a result of a prank, but the ending in my book differs greatly from that of Spider-Man. Now, I know, I know. This is a comic. A medium where most guys/girls can escape the harsh reality of life and become engrossed in fantasy. But that's not how I rolled in high school. I wanted reality. And while a billionaire obtaining high-tech gadgetry and becoming a masked vigilante isn't all that real, it's certainly easier to accept than some dorky kid becoming a masked hero and getting a variety of hot, young babes.<br /><br />Now, on to my second point, 2002's "Spider-Man" is closer to the origin story whereas 1989's "Batman" had the audacity of making The Joker the murderer of Bruce Wayne's parents. Well, anyone who's a Batman fan/reader can tell you that the man who murdered Wayne's parents was a common thug named Joe Chill. And that made most comic fans blast "Batman" the movie. That's why in 2005's "Batman Begins," fans cheered when Hollywood finally got it right. Well, "Spider-Man 3" has gone from that upstanding critics fave comic movie to the same formula that had fans blast 1989's Batman. Didn't anyone tell Sam Raimi that you're supposed to improve your screenwriting as you go and not demote it?<br /><br />"Spider-Man 3" insults fans' intelligence by making Flint Marko a.k.a. Sandman the killer of Uncle Ben Parker. Wow! That must sting to all those critics who blasted "Batman" for not sticking true to the origin. But now, even those critics are praising "Spider-Man 3" simply on its special FX. Oh, the hypocrisy. And then, to make matters worse, they give Marko a wife/girlfriend and ill daughter in an attempt to have the audience feel more sorry for him, which also is definitely not true to the original. Why the sudden need to have villains appear as wussies? Seriously. I know the filmmakers want to get the audience to say, "Oh, well, he's bad, but for a good reason." No! That's not how it is and not how it should be portrayed on film! While I don't mind a little creative liberty, there's still a fine line that you shouldn't go past. And "Spider-Man 3" definitely went over and beyond that line. They did the same thing with 2004's "Spider-Man 2," making Doctor Octopus some poor, unfortunate character who lost his wife in a lab accident he caused. Yeah, that's not the story! At least in the wretched 1997 sequel "Batman & Robin," the writers got the origin of Mr. Freeze right. No, no, no! Both Sandman and Doc Ock are hardass criminals, not misunderstood, heart-of-gold men! And that's how they should be portrayed in the movies. Now, as for Edward Brock Jr. and Venom, THAT they got right!!! Now, if you want a villain to feel sorry for, instead of Sandman, they should have incorporated The Lizard, who the filmmakers had a great opportunity to exploit as his alter ego Dr. Curt Connors is portrayed in the films by the excellent Dylan Baker. Also, The Lizard would've been a better choice seeing how he has that whole Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde persona that would've paralleled perfectly with the Spidey red suit/black suit persona storyline that Parker struggles with in this film.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, overall, I enjoyed "Spider-Man 3" and found it was a thrill to see in the theater. But while the first two at least held a solid-built story, this one seemed a lot more choppy in parts. Because of its extreme attempt at jamming so much Spider-Man lore into one movie, it lacked that feeling of a complete story with a good amount of focus on each character. A good example are the use of Gwen Stacy and her father Police Captain George Stacy, played by the illuminating Bryce Dallas Howard and the talented James Cromwell, respectively. In fact, they're hardly used at all in the film! Which is a further insult to fans seeing how Gwen Stacy was Peter Parker's first major love and is so crucial to the storyline of Spider-Man. And to think that in Spider-Man 3 she is merely used as an insulting plot device to make Mary Jane jealous!? What an insult and what a waste.<br /><br />It's a bold move for Raimi to tackle so many story lines such as the Venom symbiote and therefore introducing Eddie Brock, the ongoing troubled relationship with M.J., the troubled friendship with Harry Osborn, Peter dealing with his feelings about his Uncle Ben's death, entering a new villain Sandman, and introducing Gwen Stacy and her father George. However, it was a bit too much. This movie had its funny moments (which come off completely dorky like the true character of Peter Parker and the comic), but it also had its scary moments. And while the two villains seem like a mere sidenote in this movie (not being as developed as previous villains Green Goblin and Doctor Octopus), the filmmakers are safe because, after all, the trailer does say that the main villain in this story is Parker's inner darkness. Like I said, this review may sound like an attack but it's just a warning to fellow fans/readers that it's not true to the original story. Now, moviegoers who don't know the comic that well (and only know the Spidey movies) will probably like this movie a lot. But it's not the dazzling story that's been originally written over the years and is an insult to true fans' intelligence.<br /><br />Overall, as a film, "Spider-Man 3" works and I'm amazed at how brilliantly the FX crews can bring Spidey's web-slinging adventures to the screen. The performances by Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, Topher Grace, and especially James Franco (who STOLE this movie) are great, but, unfortunately, Howard, Cromwell and especially Church (who had a very limited amount of dialogue) were wasted in this film. The writing was off in comparing to the previous two films but the overall plot is interesting enough to keep audiences jamming the theaters for the next month or so. Bottom line: Although enjoyable, "Spider-Man 3" is a big movie, and that may ultimately be its problem.</p></br><a href="../users/A32K4BV5DFG3KP.html">A32K4BV5DFG3KP</a><br/><p>Spider man 3 could have been really good but sadly it was not. With the great fight sequences and fantastic cinematography,it had all of the nuts and bolts. Here are some of the flaws. The plot was so mixed up and crazy who could keep up with it? Nothing was explained ,where did the meteor come from ,I know space but,come on some kinda explanation was needed. What was the biomass made out of? Even if they had said it was made out of some kinda dark matter molecular energy it would have given some credability to the story. This film is also guilty of a major sequel no no. Changing the story line to fit the movies plot. With the sandman's charecter being incorporated into the story line back in the first film. Not to mention this movie is needlessly too long . Thirty minutes could have easily been cut off. Kirstin for the sake of Kirstin,c'mon I'd would have rather seen spidey hook up with the landlords daughter ,who at least seems like a real person. The "I'm to sexy bad boy sequence" was really corny and way too long. Overall the action was great but the jumbled mess of a plot and too many villians,who were all just misguided good people gone down the wrong path,Isn't there anyone who is just truely evil? Could have been great but sadly it is what it is.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R1HAXRNU0QX7.html">A2R1HAXRNU0QX7</a><br/><p>Spiderman 3 adheres pretty tightly to the "More is More" theory.  More villains, more subplots, more running time, more special effects, etc.  It is a big, loud "Summer" movie...apparently among the most expensive ever made...and the money shows on screen.<br /><br />It is also an occasionally boring or silly movie.  I realize this is a comic-book movie, but Spiderman 2 gave us enough believable humanity that we now kind of expect this series to present believable humans enduring unbelievable things and reacting in a way that resembles the human race as we know it.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD  (BIG ONES):<br /><br />Spiderman 3 veers back into incredulity.  For example...(this could be spoiler if you haven't seen any previews), Peter becomes infected with some black goop that not only turns his red suit to black...but unleashes his id.  He pulls his hair down over his forehead, resembling the lead singer of The Cure or Fall Out Boy.  That's amusing.  Then he begins to strut around the neighborhood, checking out the girls and buying "stylish" clothes in a scene that looks like it would be a spoof of Saturday Night Fever in a movie like Date Movie.  It's a sketch comedy bit in a bloated Action movie.  It was painfully out of place.<br /><br />There are other moments.  Mary Jane Watson, Peter's beloved, never manages to tell Peter she's lost her Broadway gig.  Granted, their relationship is struggling...but she would have told him at some point.<br /><br />Also, I'm finding it harder to buy all the coincidences.  First, the black goop falls from a meteor that happens to land right where Peter has his moped parked.  Then Flint Marko, the "bad guy" just happens to stumble into a scientific experiment at just the perfect moment to be turned into Sandman.  And then when Peter sheds the black stuff, he manages to drop it right onto his nemesis Brock.  It just stretches my willingness to suspend disbelief.<br /><br />Also, while we're on the "bad" stuff:  James Franco as Peter's friend/enemy Harry is terrible.  When his character gets amnesia, he also becomes a complete goofball.  And when he gets his memory back and is "torn" between helping or hurting Peter...his torment is just laughable.  I know Franco garnered a lot of acclaim in his earlier career...but he pretty much wasted any goodwill I might have had for him.  And frankly, Tobey Maguire looked mostly bored in his role.  I know he's always felt some ambivalence towards his role...but they paid you enough to lose that ambivalence, Tobey.  Get over being filthy rich, successful and a star!  I know it's tough, but suck it up!<br /><br />SPOILERS OVER:<br /><br />On the good side, we have nice performances from Topher Grace, who is alternately amusing and despicable.  Here's an actor who has some spark.  He could be in a league with Ryan Gosling if given the chance.  Think of his work in TRAFFIC.  Thomas Hayden Church does well by Marko/Sandman.  (And our sympathy for him is helped by EXCELLENT special effects for his various transformations.)  Bruce Campbell has a brief but VERY funny cameo as an unctuous French maitre d.  Thanks, Sam Raimi, for continuing to use him!<br /><br />The most important parts of any Spiderman movie are the action sequences, of course, and there are some good ones, alright!  The scene in which Spiderman saves the girl (Bryce Dallas Howard) from the malfunctioning high-rise crane is a blast.  There's real suspense there.  The final scene is over-the-top and exciting...especially as cars, cinderblocks and other debris plunge dangerously close to the imperiled Mary Jane.<br /><br />So I found the movie to be somewhat of a letdown from the psychological and acting standpoint.  The screenplay was just TOO packed...trying to be too many things to too many people.  But you won't complain about the action set-pieces...they are state-of-the-art.  So if you lower your expectations a little...you'll still have fun.  3.5 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LVZOK9F7K4CN.html">A1LVZOK9F7K4CN</a><br/><p>I saw this movie at an advanced screening and, although it is not a bad film, it doesn't live up to the standard set by Spider-Man 2.  They did it right in Spider-Man 2 by hiring Michael Chabon to co-write the script.  Based on the evidence of the other two films, he brought a much-need sensibility to the project.<br /><br />Part of the problem is that Spider-Man 3 is over-stuffed.  This is the same mistake that plagued the Batman sequels, as well as X-Men 3.  It tries to tell the Black Costume Saga, as well as the Venom Saga, as well as the Green Goblin II Saga, AND be a sequel to the previous two films (not to mention throwing in the Sandman too!).  Perhaps they thought that this would be the end of the franchise and they wanted to get everything out of the way.  The film opens with Peter Parker getting a swelled-head from all the acclaim Spider-Man is receiving and turning into a jerk.  All this seems very uncharacteristic of him and I spent the beginning of the film wondering if the symbiote had already attached itself.  When he does don the black costume, Peter Parker suddenly looks like Robert Smith from The Cure, and he REALLY becomes a jerk.  The worst scene in the film involves a musical/dance number that looks like it should have been in The Mask, not Spider-Man.<br /><br />The result of all this is that not everything gets the attention it deserves.  Venom fans will be most disappointed in this film.  He should have had his own movie.  Instead, he is treated almost as an after-thought.  He is not true to the comic-book character and unfortunately, the filmmakers chose to have his face revert to Eddie Brock almost every time he speaks.<br /><br />Supposedly, there will be three more Spider-Man films.  I don't know what the rest have in store - it feels as though they've exhausted their possibilities.  There are a lot of good things in this film - it is worth seeing.  Just don't get your hopes up too high.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Sam Raimi's SPIDER-MAN films are something of legend amongst the comic-book-to-film fans. The first two were excellent and helped, perhaps, pull more people toward the comic book world. Number 2, in particular, was astonishingly good in that we got to see how much Spidey had to give up in order to be the man he had to be. And with the mondo-budget given to this third film (something like $250 million, I believe, which was only recently eclipsed by the $300 million Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End), one would suspect that it would hold onto its previous successes by following a somewhat similar format.<br /><br />But no...<br /><br />Although loaded with action and some top-notch special effects, the film is overloaded with too many characters and some unwontedly bad scenes that were in need of excision.<br /><br />This time Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OY8NBK">The Good German</a>) is up against not one, not two, not three, but four evil forces. Although this sounds enticing, there's no way (NO WAY!) anything approaching cohesion could happen for this 139 minute film: an evil, outerspace symbiote that attaches itself to Spidey's suit; Green Goblin Jr./Harry Osborn, played by the returning James Franco (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPFCPE">Tristan and Isolde</a>); Sandman/Flint Marko played by Thomas Haden Church (CHARLOTTE'S WEB); and, eventually, Venom/Eddie Brock, played by Topher Grace.<br /><br />I'm not sure what Mr. Raimi was thinking, but more is not necessarily "more," if you catch my meaning. Audiences don't need impossible odds to enjoy a hero's journey into darkness and back; we just need a good story that holds together.<br /><br />Oh, and we definitely don't need a woosie Spider-Man crying in every other scene. The guy's a superhero, make him act like one for crying out loud!<br /><br />It's still nice to see the beautiful Kirsten Dunst (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CNESJO">Elizabethtown</a>) in her role as Mary Jane the love interest. She can act well and she's believable in every scene, it just that she gets lost amongst the overly crowded cast, too, just like the Sandman and Venom do.<br /><br />Too many questions about what's happening plague the middle of the film but are wrapped up in slipshod fashion at the very rushed ending.<br /><br />It isn't all bad, though. The scenes with Spider-Man and Sandman together are shot well, with the special effects taking center-stage more than the story or the actors themselves. The death of a pivotal character is handled well but, again, the tears are overdone and make Spidey look wimpish.<br /><br />Perhaps the next Spider-Man film will help put this one behind us as "the bad one." We can all hope that Mr. Raimi gets back to doing character shots that help strengthen our superhero rather than making him appear like a crybaby.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>Personally I liked this Spiderman the best. I not only liked the fact they showed that everyone can have a dark side, but Parker didn't seem as kiddish as in the previous movies. I enjoyed the new bad guys Venom (Spiderman copy with nasty big teeth), Sandman (a muscular thief that gets rematerialized with sand), and a new Goblin (Son of Goblin), and the turn around of two of them. Spidey uses the force to turn them, well something like that. Nicely done effects added to the good story and acting. Overall plenty of action, and a more in depth look at Parker and those around him. I bought this on DVD since I had the other two already. I'm glad to have this one in the set. Excellent quality DVD with several extras.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X7FS1H4R02W1.html">A1X7FS1H4R02W1</a><br/><p>First Peter tackled green goblin. and in 2 he tackled with Oc, what can top those 2? I hope 3 will the best yet. Hope Pete will marry MJ.</p></br><a href="../users/A22AD8M2SSOFHJ.html">A22AD8M2SSOFHJ</a><br/><p>I can say that I have never sat thru a Spiderman movie until this one.  Spiderman 3 is a simple movie with quite a bit of action.  Actually for anyone with a lack of attention this movie is great.  Yeah I would be included in that grouping.<br /><br />I guess what makes Spiderman so likable is that he isn't like so many other super heros.  He isn't a muscle man and his powers are pretty simple.  His enemies almost always seem stronger than him.  The enemies even seem to have a human side.<br /><br />I didn't really feel any letdowns.  The action was there from the get go and it seemed like every villain was after Spiderman.  The real villain was Spidermans alter-ego.  Coming from a black goo and transforming Spidermans suit.  This goo actually caused Spidey to be a little more evil and a lot less forgiving.  Of course there were several good battles that made everything worthwhile even when everything else was lacking.<br /><br />This movie won't have you yelling for more but it sure will give you a fun ride.  The action is intense and never seems to end.  The acting was so-so and seemed like the same story-line from other Spiderman movies.  Although with the negative this is still a good movie.  A great movie for families or anyone who has enjoyed the series.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EJYJC25OJVKK.html">A3EJYJC25OJVKK</a><br/><p>"Spider-Man 3" is a wonderful if a bit shaky successor to the spectacular "Spider Man 2" from back in 2004.  Though the reviews were decidedly mixed, it still became a phenomenal success.  I can't say for sure that it can stack up in the long-run against it's predecessor. I mean, I don't think they could surpass the mini-sun fusion machine that Doctor Octavius created.<br /><br /> The dust settles from the epic confrontation with scientist turned diabolical madman Doctor Octavius. Peter Parker's double-life as Spider Man and as Peter Parker seems to be settling back to normal at last. Mary Jane has returned into his life, things are looking up, and New York cleans up from the magnetic mess from the mini-sun that brought down Pier 56. However new threats emerge. One is a criminal named Flint Marko is on the run from the law after escaping from prison on murder charges. Due to quantum circumstances, Marko's molecular structure is altered significantly which causes him to transform into Sandman who becomes Spider Man's most powerful adversary. The other one however is an enemy that is unlike any other. It is not even just another bad human. It is an alien liquid life form that survives by attaching itself and assimilating itself onto a human called a Symbiote. And when it bonds with a host, it's very difficult to separate from it. This symbiote will have major influences on Spidey that could potentially make him worse than the villains put together if allowed to fester for too long. The effects of the symbiote are enough that they are already making Peter into something that others no longer even recognize.<br /><br /> This movie though while still a five-star suffers from a particular problem called character saturation where too many major characters are brought into focus. The same thing weighs down "X-Men: The Last Stand" from a year before with too many characters.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MG8DHACXH5MS.html">A2MG8DHACXH5MS</a><br/><p>Spiderman faces his dark side and a new enemy called the Sandman who accidentally killed his uncle. The Green Hornet is back and is out for revenge thinking Peter/Spiderman killed his father. In fact, there is revenge all over the place. Spiderman wants to get back at the Sandman... the Green Hornet wants to get back at Spiderman ... and Peter's photographer rival at the Daily Planet wants back at Peter Parker. Mary Jane struggles on Broadway and finds herself entangled in a love triangle with Harry and Peter while Peter faces his greatest enemy ... himself.<br /><br />The film never explains what the black slime is that ends up turning Spiderman into a dark figure. It seems to be from outer space and the ringing of bells drive it batty. The weirdest scene is when Spiderman rips off his black suit and it falls onto his rival at the Daily Planet. It makes him into the Anti-Spiderman and takes him over. This is the oddest part of the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N49TOJZFG48H.html">A1N49TOJZFG48H</a><br/><p>more plot threads than egyptian cotton . i though the idea was "let you entertain me" ?

That being said, what we have here is a pretty solid superhero story that does as much right as it does wrong, and could have been so much better than what it is.  As the story picks up, Peter (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) are together and happy, which soon gets spoiled upon the arrival of new villain Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) who is the real man responsible for Uncle Ben's death.  Not to mention the fact that a gooey, alien symbiote has latched itself onto Peter, and has allowed for all his inhibitions to get left at the door as he embraces his dark side.  The biggest problem with Spider-Man 3 is that there are too many characters in the story.  Sure, it's nice to see Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) in the movie, but she's here for little reason really.  What is also disappointing is having Eddie Brock/Venom (Topher Grace) here as well.  Arguably the most hyped about aspect of the film upon it's release, Brock's character development is non-sensical, and while his transformation into Venom and usage in the climactic final battle are plenty good, he's just not here enough.  James Franco's turn as Harry/New Goblin is also quite underdeveloped, although when he's bad, he's good.  Despite the negatives, there is a lot to admire here, mainly Maguire's gleeful turn as the "bad" Peter Parker (with an emo haircut), and he is clearly having a blast doing it.  Stan Lee's cameo is the best the legendary creator has had in a Marvel movie yet, and Bruce Campbell once again pops up in a cameo, and provides some nice laughs.  The CGI effects are wonderful, and director Sam Raimi knows what he's doing, but it just feels like he wanted to do too much with too little time.  All in all, Spider-Man 3 isn't bad one bit, and you can certainly do much worse when it comes to mega budget superhero movies, but at the end of the day, the film proves sadly disappointing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>To start off this review, I'd like to give a brief plot synopsis:  Peter Parker's got the girl, got the old friend back, got the fame (as Spidey), and got no problems.  Then, petty criminal Flint Marko (who's got no money but does have a really sick daughter) gets some sandy powers and uses them to his advantage.  Then, Peter gets some galactic goo on his Spidey suit and gets more power (think HGH for superheroes).  It all goes to Peter's head and then he loses the girl, loses the old friend (but gains back an enemy), loses the fame, and takes on a ton of problems which include (but aren't limited to) competing photographer Eddie Brock.  It all sounds sort of like a very long and jumbled country song, doesn't it?  Well, in all honesty, that's sort of what this film is.<br /><br />The film starts with Peter on top and then he is taken down hard, very hard, by co-screenplay writer/director Sam Raimi and screenplay writers Ivan Raimi and Alvin Sargent.  Sam Raimi does an excellent job with this film considering the massive amount of subplots that this story deals with seemingly all at once.  He develops the new villains of Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) and Venom (Topher Grace) as best as he can.  He also tries to bring to a close the love triangle of Parker, Mary Jane, and Harry Osborne.  He also throws in a bit of jealousy between Peter and MJ via the introduction of Gwen Stacey.  We also get to catch up with Aunt May and Jonah Jameson.<br /><br />The story is held together rather well so long as it's just Spidey either fighting with Sandman or the new Goblin.  Heck, even Peter Parker's lovelife makes a little bit of sense so long as it's just him, MJ, and Harry.  Things don't get messy until Gwen Stacey and her boyfriend/photographer Eddie Brock enter the fray.  That's where the train leaves the tracks.  It's the same old song and dance as what happened to the "Batman" franchise once the Catwoman and Penguin were coupled together to cause problems for Batman.  The movie becomes rushed, characters are dealt with too quickly in order to make room for other characters, and plotlines are tied up too neatly or just left by the wayside.  That's the major problem of this film.<br /><br />Had Venom/Eddie Brock (played by Topher Grace) been left out of this film, it would have been perfect.  Instead, we get a second-rate, rushed treatment of the Venom character and Eric from "That 70's Show" with an attitude and muscle to back it up.  Every time Brock popped up on the screen (with or without his symbiote companion), all I could think of was Eric getting razzed by Kelso or beat up by Donna.  Grace was miscast for this part.  He's not a bad actor.  It's just that Eddie Brock is played out too closely to Grace's Eric Foreman character from "That 70's Show."  Gwen Stacey is easy on the eyes and does a decent job of stirring things up between Peter and MJ, but the character doesn't belong in this film either.  It would have been much better had she and Eddie Brock been removed from the film completely.  In fact, Sam Raimi admitted that early on he didn't want Venom in this picture.  It was only after a little nudging from producer Avi Arad that he came to like the character's addition to the story.<br /><br />Otherwise, the film is outstanding.  Spiderman's battles with the new Goblin and Sandman are excellent and rival the brutal confrontations that Spidey had with Doctor Octopus in the second "Spiderman" flick.  They beat the heck out of each other.  The special effects are very good and Sandman's action scenes channel "The Mummy" with all the dust flying around.  I even enjoyed Peter Parker's "Saturday Night Fever" foray.  I found it to be quite funny, although it did run just a tad bit too long.<br /><br />The cast, excepting Topher Grace, was wonderful.  Tobey Maguire has a solid hold on the character of Peter Parker and much like Christopher Reeve as Superman, he'll be the only person worthy of being the Webslinger.  Dunst does an excellent job as MJ.  James Franco, despite having to struggle for screentime with Sandman and Venom, does a good job as Harry Osborne/New Goblin.  His character, in my opinion, developed the most in the second film and he carries that development over to this sequel well.  With little character development Church still manages to pull at the heartstrings as Sandman.  His character is given only a basic treatment so that we only understand why he's a criminal and why his fate in the film is what it is.  Bryce Dallas Howard does a good job as the airheaded Gwen Stacey.  The rest of the cast, including Sam Raimi stalwarts Bruce Campbell and Ted Raimi, do excellent jobs with their limited rolls.<br /><br />So why four stars?  For the simple fact that this really is an excellent film considering how much information is processed in its 140-minute runtime.  Other than the unnecessary villain cluster that hampers the tale, "Spiderman 3" plays well as an action yarn and even as a moral story of personal responsibility over selfish acts.  If a fourth film is made (and I seriously doubt that Maguire or Raimi will be returning), I hope that Spidey's villain count is lowered to one.  If you enjoyed the other "Spiderman" films, you'll enjoy this one.  It loses its way here and there but is, overall, a very good action film.</p></br><a href="../users/A26R4PDCZX5SOK.html">A26R4PDCZX5SOK</a><br/><p>4 of 5 stars for the comic book based movie Spider-Man 3. Of the three Spider-Man movies, this is the most complex with the deepest focus on the main characters. Tobey Maguire & Kristen Dunst return in the key roles. The overall plot is about a strange black creature arrives on the Earth and ultimately bonds with Peter Parker making a "black Spider-man". There are several sub-plots in the movie which add to the complexity of the story. There is Harry the son of the bad guy from Spider-Man 2 who first wants revenge for the death of his father, then loses his memory and ultimately things work out OK. There is the "SandMan" who was the guy who really killed Parker's father; able to shift any/all of his body to sand he is difficult to fight. And then there is the engagement of Parker and MJ; well maybe.<br /><br />As with all of the other Spider-Man movies, this one is extremely well made with good story, good characters and good action. Good special effects. The only reason for not giving a 5 star is the complexity of the plot which doesn't seem to flow well.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WE94927YC3KI.html">A2WE94927YC3KI</a><br/><p>I love spider-man movies and this movie was more exciting. This movie enemy was sandman, black suit, and his angry friend that three combination. Also the spider-man never lose control his mind but this movie was he changed a bit. Anyway this movie was exciting and fun. I love it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>Everything is going well for a change for Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire).  He's finally dating the woman of his dreams, new Broadway star Mary Jane Watson (Kristen Dunst).  He's doing very well at school.  And his alter ego, Spider-man, is the toast of New York City, much to the dismay of newspaperman J. Jonah Jamison (J. K. Simmons).<br /><br />The only downside to his life is former best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco).  Harry has recently learned (or decided) that it was Peter who killed Mr. Osborn and has vowed revenge.<br /><br />Soon, that will be the least of Peter's worries.  The man truly responsible for killing his uncle Ben has just escaped from jail.  Flint Marco (Thomas Haden Church) is on the run when he stumbles into a science experiment and gets molecularly turned into Sandman.  Meanwhile, Peter's plan to propose to Mary Jane falls apart and the two begin to drift.  And a mysterious substance has attached itself to Peter, tapping into his darker side and making him more powerful at the same time.  Will his new power and attitude destroy him?  Can he get revenge on a man who has no shape?<br /><br />Since I'm not a fan of the comic books, I can't comment on how the movie compares to the source material.  I can, however, complain about the change to the Uncle Ben storyline.  Those scenes in the original were what made Spider-man become Spider-man.  Suddenly, this revelation changes everything.  This doesn't sit well with me.  Couple that with the weak climax (I get why they had to do it thematically, but I still didn't like it), and you've got my complaints on the film.<br /><br />The rest of the film was wonderful.  The action scenes were amazing and had me on the edge of my seat.  The special effects made me believe everything I saw.  Yet the movie had plenty of emotional storylines.  They were perfectly balanced with the action and really made things even better.  For comic relief, there are Peter Parker's scenes under the influence of the virus.  And I loved Harry Osborn's arc in the film.  Even with all the different notes, the actors never missed a beat and made everything believable.<br /><br />If they just hadn't changed the details of Uncle Ben's death, I would have loved the film.  As it is, it is still entertaining.  A worthy pop corn flick.</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>When is enough, enough?  These comic book movies and their sequels are like recycled garbage at this point.  This film bordered on pretentiousness, like a blood sucking viper it drained the life out of me.  I'm not down with the whole "spidey" thing, and all the bouncing off buildings and loud thuds and bangs?  It's like does spider man drive a camaro? Wink, wink.  It's like, get a life and start on a new action hero like Green Lantern or anybody at this point.  When they make movies like Spider Man 3, they keep repeating the same actions and expecting different results at the end.  Both me and my roomate literally fell asleep through this, but at different times, me first and then him.  I don't need to see the rest of the film, you couln't PAY me.</p></br><a href="../users/APQ8N1UKS1RDC.html">APQ8N1UKS1RDC</a><br/><p>This movie is SAD!

Tobey looking a lil chunkie, not taking the role<br />serious enough, thank god for CGI though Spider Man looks very fit.<br />Now lets get with the villans. With the exception of Sandman the<br />badguys are suppose to wear mask's am I right? I think so.

And I will not start on Mary<br />jane watson(Sorry Kresten I feel you are a good actress just so miscast<br />as MARY JANE you look nothing like her. But you seem to have stoled the<br />movie. I mean could she have had anymore screen time??? The title<br />should be called SPIDER-MAN 3 The Mary Jane Story! Any way if you<br />love this movie than you love Police Academy 11 for this is Dribble<br />and I gave it 2 stars for I love Sam the man Raimi and of course SPIDEY<br />but this could have been better MUCH BETTER! I wish Sam could have made<br />Spider-Man in 1991 with C. Thomas Howell from the Hitcher and The<br />Outsiders. NOW THATS PETER PARKER! Can everybody see it's me? Can<br />everybody see my FAAACCCEEE??????????

Dialog like "I like being bad," professional and amorous jealousies that an eight-grader would find puerile, and a positively painful attempt by Mr. Parker to act as the black glop recommends.<br /><br />I like comic book movies, some of them, and I liked the earlier Spiderman movies. I just don't like this.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/AQUVTQFFXP4AC.html">AQUVTQFFXP4AC</a><br/><p>I'm not a Spiderman fan, but I could see how the first one was good.  I thought the second was an absolute disaster, though.<br /><br />Luckily, this one wasn't as terrible as the second.  But that's not saying much.<br /><br />For one, the villains are totally spoiled, in my opinion.  The sandman is so damn mopey and frowney that he's no fun.  He's just one of those "honest cons out to help his family" and decides the best way to use his new super power is to steal money and give it to his dying child---because the cops wouldn't dare track the money down when he looses it.  He's also apparently invincible, which makes him that much less interesting.<br /><br />Venom, one of my favorite villains from the old cartoon show, is reduced to a snotty little teen brat played by the actor who will forever be known as "That Foreman kid from That 70s Show", who made very lame wise-ass remarks even while in the Venom suit.  Imagine that fiendish black muscled creature with the huge mouth and snarling fangs suddenly snipping "Oh well look, Spiderman, you're like, such a douche!"<br /><br />Obligatory from the sequel is the "new" Goblin in the form of Harry Osborne.  This one seems to be the only one in the right frame of mind for killing Spiderman, as he's the only one who ever comes remotely close.  Unfortunately, he falls victim to the cliche' "let me talk to you while we're fighting and rather than do something efficient like stab you or shoot you or blow you up, let me just throw you into things and hope your bones shatter", and then ends up sustaining a head injury which SHOULD kill a normal person.  He loses his memory for a while, then slowly regains it long enough to provide the film's one high point for me---making Spiderman cry when Mary Jane walks out on him.<br /><br />Thus we enter Emo Spiderman.  The black venom's effect on Peter Parker, rather than make him anything remotely wicked or sneering, makes him emo.  Any time the venom takes hold of him, his hair goes over his eye emo-style, and he starts acting so ridiculously "suave", jerking his crotch at women at the street, dancing wildly at the local jazz club, and picking fights with people.  Tobey Maguire shows he's got a lot more acting classes to go through before he can convince us of this new "darker" Spiderman.<br /><br />Lousy acting, a dense plot, and laughably pathetic characters even more laughably pathetically acted makes this sequel worth watching only because of how bad it was.</p></br><a href="../users/A1N8K1X0OLLADY.html">A1N8K1X0OLLADY</a><br/><p>Spend your money on Spiderman part 2 dvd, its much better!<br /><br />Spiderman 3 is total garbage.

But that limits his adventures a lot to dangling and swinging at the end of a spider thread. So he needs to be presented with some companions who are going to be his preys, if possible, if necessary. To make things even better an extra-terrestrial organism falls onto the earth with some meteor and this organism is going to invade that poor Spiderman and make him turn black, aggressive, vindictive, vain. He will then cause a lot of suffering by doing bad things for the pleasure of dominating people and things. He will also relive the death of his uncle in the most vengeful way and try to capture the supposed and convicted though not quite proved killer who has just escaped from his narrow prison cell. Then he will get into some riffraff with his supposed best friend who in his turn becomes vengeful about his father who was supposedly killed by Spiderman, though it was never proved. Add to that a little bit of technological magic to turn the escapee into a sandstorm and you have three fourth of the drama. The last fourth is a photographer who wants to become a star in the press and who cheats in order to do it with a fake Spiderman picture. He will be exposed. But that drama will not turn tragic because of some circumstances that will make the best friend realize he was dumb, that will make Spiderman free of his ET invader, that will even liberate the second host of the ET black invader. Bells will be the solutions, church bells of course, and a lot of luck too, and final forgiveness. Then the city will go back to its absolutely boring peacefulness. Yet the film is funny and packed with action, even if that action is slightly grandiloquent.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID</p></br><a href="../users/ABFOAYZA2UHD3.html">ABFOAYZA2UHD3</a><br/><p>excellent effects, animation sequences, battle sequences (directing on those as well), but the rest so disappointing!<br /><br />i so loved the spidey while he was just a comic book character and animation possibilities we now witness were not even a dream! and what did they do with it? they all but KILLED spidey.<br /><br />they made him cry with toby's huge blue eyes, they made him act ridiculous under alien's influence, oh, they managed to make him quite pathetic a couple of times.<br /><br />aunt may, on the other hand, is just as boring and anal as i remember her in the comic books.<br /><br />james franco is always a joy to look at. thank god for him..<br /><br />and that's about it.<br /><br />my GOD, this movie is so bad.. its at least 30 minutes longer than it should be, at times it slows down to alost a HALT. romantic interludes way way too long and boring to kaboozas.<br /><br />i couldn't wait to get the heck out of the movie theatre.<br /><br />and i saw a few people leave half way thru the film on the OPENING NIGHT.<br /><br />if you can piss of the fans, that stands for something, doesn't it.. :(</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>I am not a Spiderman fan but have seen all 3. The second is by far the better out of all 3, and this is definetely the worst. The overblown, boring sappy story is pathetic and being the length it is, I was squirming halfway through, and I never do that. The 'enemies' were laughable, especially Sandman, who was utterly and completely pointless. Toby Maguire is so whiny in this( though that is pretty typical of him in this role). I will not even start on Kirsten Dunst. The one decent thing is the effects. But then again, I've seen it all before, so, nothing new. I would probably never watch this again.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P2NBM3P3TS2X.html">A1P2NBM3P3TS2X</a><br/><p>The first two Spidey films had moments of film-making wonder, awe, and fun.  This one simply was no fun at all.  It was a by-the-numbers film, and not very well written or executed.  Read below:<br /><br />First off, note that the screenplay was written by director Sam Raimi and his brother, not by more seasoned screenwriters as was the case with the first two films.  In this case it seems to have made a huge difference.  The script is weak and lazy.<br /><br />Secondly, the inclusion of the Sandman character seems completely superfluous.  He could have been cut out entirely and you never would have missed it.<br /><br />Thirdly, the plot hinges on geographic coincidences that would make a statistician slit his own throat in disbelief.<br /><br />And how many times can we hear Peter's Aunt May spout the same dialogue over and over again?  It seems like she gives the same speeches in each movie.  At about the 2 hour mark in this film, just when the audience is tired of it all and ready for the film to end, Aunt May launches into another one of her dialogue scenes that is so corny it made the audience giggle.<br /><br />The audience I saw this movie with was a large crowd made up of all types of people, and I could easily sense the audience's restlessness towards the end.  Few people seemed to like this movie and sure left the screening room in a big hurry when it was all over.<br /><br />This movie wasn't just disappointing, it was plain out insultingly bad.  Big budget, low creativity and originality.<br /><br />I decided before the film was even over that I would NEVER want to sit through this again.  Shame on Raimi for making such a piece of garbage.<br /><br />The special effects were spiffy and looked cool, but so what?</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>I don't understand why so many people think "Spider-Man 3" is the best movie in this trilogy. I thought it was the weakest film by far. In the film, Peter Parker, a.k.a. Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire), is on top of the world...both literally and figuratively. He's happily involved with Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), and Spider-Man is loved and adored by all of New York City. Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. Mary Jane is fired from her first Broadway show, and Peter's freelance photography career is threatened when Eddie (Topher Grace), a rival photographer, tries to steal Peter's thunder. Things with Peter's former best friend, Harry (James Franco), aren't going very well, either, and there's also a new villain in town: the mysterious Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), who is connected to the death of Peter's uncle. On top of everything else, Peter encounters a strange black organism that transforms into a powerful black Spider-Man suit, which turns out to have devastating consequences.<br /><br />The problem with this movie is that there's way too much going on at once, and all of the subplots and supporting characters are significantly short-changed. There were also many more stupid one-liners and failed comedic moments in "Spider-Man 3" than in the first three films, and I was extremely disappointed with the ending, which was unnecessarily depressing. I'm sure the film's producers are hoping for a "Spider-Man 4," but this series just needs to go away before it embarrasses itself even more.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>As I was watching Spiderman 3 I was reminded of when Joel Schumacher took the reins from Tim Burton (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B5XOY8">Batman</a>/<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B5XOSO">Batman Returns</a>) to direct <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B5XOXY">Batman Forever</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000B5XOXO">Batman & Robin</a>. Remember how Schumacher brought back the campy TV series Batman (especially for Batman & Robin) and destroyed the dark nature of the Batman series that Burton created?<br /><br />I wouldn't say that Spiderman 3 was as bad as Batman & Robin, but it was on par with Batman Forever...just an average movie. And that is surprising. Because it's not like there was a directorial change in the Spiderman series; Sam Raimi has been there from the start.<br /><br />Spiderman 3 has a...what's the word...'lighter' feel than the first two. It's brighter. It's a little campy at times. It's a little unrealistic. The effects are way over-the-top at times...especially The Green Goblin's glider skills. Spiderman 3 is just a lot less believable than the first two.<br /><br />Spiderman 3 was very fun to watch though. I was thoroughly entertained. Great visuals in high def (I watched the Blu Ray version). The first two Spiderman movies focus mainly on Spiderman's confrontation with one foe per film, but there are several villains in Spiderman 3. This helps provide an abundance of action.<br /><br />But the action doesn't save the movie from its wide stretches of reality. Sam Raimi is great at taking unfathomable situations, adding a little silliness, but making it all seem real. He just didn't do it as well in Spiderman 3 as he's clearly capable of doing it. So that took some of the shine off of Spiderman 3 for me.<br /><br />Let's hope that Raimi brings his A-game to Spiderman 4 announced for a 2009 release.</p></br><a href="../users/A3BJDFGSLXFB36.html">A3BJDFGSLXFB36</a><br/><p>I missed Spiderman 3 at the theater and had to wait for the home video release. During that waiting period, I read many reviews and listened to the opinions of family and friends, most of which seemed to be negative or, at least "not as good as the first two".<br /><br />I wasn't expecting too much when I popped the disc into the player, but I was pleasantly surprised. Not only did the movie sport fantastic special effects and some well-choreographed fight scenes, the story had tremendous DEPTH.<br /><br />Unlike many "superhero" films, the Spiderman series focuses on the psychological aspects of the characters rather than epic fight scenes and flashy costumes (although the Spiderman movies DO offer that as well - you get the best of both worlds). The character developement is what gives these films substance and makes them more than just eye-candy.<br /><br />Brilliantly done.<br /><br />I must say that I enjoyed this film more than Spiderman 2, but not as much as the first Spiderman. Yes, there were multiple plot threads and more than one "villain", but so what? The story comes together quite well in the end and left me wanting more.<br /><br />I, for one, am looking forward to Spiderman 4.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P6NRWDD1NT4B.html">A1P6NRWDD1NT4B</a><br/><p>In SPIDER-MAN 3, Director Sam Raimi has kept the tone the same as in the other two great films.  Again, the heart of the film is the relationship of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson (Tobey McGuire & Kirsten Dunst) and this has been been the driving force of the film series. Each film has been emotionally powerful because of this. However, it might have slightly weighted down this film which is a minor complaint to this reviewer.  It didn't allow the full development of Eddie Brock/Venom (Topher Grace) and Sandman/Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church). However, whatever screen time they had, their characterizations were excellent. Once again, another key character in the film series is Peter Parker's Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) as Spider-Man's voice of reason.  It's great that the creators of this film series have had the insight to carry over this element from the comics and use it in all three films (even the use of Ben Parker --Cliff Roberston--in flashback sequences). Rosemay Harris as Aunt May has been so good in all three films. SPIDER-MAN 3 had a lot to prove because SPIDER-MAN 2 was such a great film and this film had a lot of information to sift through. Such elements that were added to the plot was resolving the issues of the Peter Parker/Harry Osborn conflict and the real story behind the death of Ben Parker.  Another minor plot complaint is how the alien symbiote just happens to conveniently find Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Then again, this is a film based on a comic book and these type of coincidences happen all the time. The scenes with Peter and the symbiote provide a bit of comic respite in the film between all the mayhem. Tobey McGuire and his portrayal of Peter Parker/Spider-Man is probably one of the best comic-book casting adapations to the screen. Overall, SPIDER-MAN 3 is a very entertaining and satisfying film. The action and special effects were once again excellent, and the casting was great. Also, with all the plot elements in the story, this film, as in the first two, had another very emotional third act.</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>What set the "Spider-Man" films apart from many other superhero films was a delicate balance between comic book action and emotion, between high tech special effects and human drama. In this regard, Sam Raimi's "Spider-Man 3" is in no way a departure from the first two films; it remains on perfectly equal ground, presenting a story that carefully combines frenetic fight sequences, grandiose science fiction, and an emotional roller coaster. I don't dare assume that this is the best film in the series, nor can I claim that it's the greatest superhero film ever made. What I can say is that, like its predecessors, "Spider-Man 3" is a fun movie that is sure to entertain those who are willing to experience it.<br /><br />The first major scene has Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) lying on a giant spider web in the middle of a park, staring up at the night sky. The romantic aspect plays itself to the fullest, and rightfully so; the emotional core of the story depends on their love and possible engagement, which will be tested in more ways than one. The first test arrives on a rogue meteorite that crash-lands in the park (where it came from is never explained, but I suppose it doesn't really matter); a viscous, shape shifting black goo emerges from its smoldering cocoon. It then attaches itself to Parker's motorbike and follows him home, where it waits. For what is not yet known, but if there's one thing to be sure about in this kind of film, it's that anything from outer space--especially a dark sludge--most likely means trouble.<br /><br />The second test is Spider-Man's fame, which is putting a strain on Parker and M.J.'s relationship. It seems to be going to Parker's head lately, and it shows during an award ceremony (Spidey is given the key to the city for his heroic acts). He swings into the crowd and high-fives a number of kids before doing gymnastics on the stage. He then hangs upside down and asks the presenter--Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard)--to kiss him like M.J. did in the first movie. It was never meant to be romantic; it was only for the sake of publicity. Nonetheless, M.J. is not at all amused. Parker is unconsciously pushing her away to keep his Spider-Man image strong, which doesn't exactly boost her self-confidence. It doesn't help that her dream of staring in a Broadway musical is shattered; the critics have a field day attacking her singing voice, and she's fired from the production.<br /><br />The third test is Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), an escaped convict. Because of a scientific accident only possible in a comic book adaptation, his molecular structure has been altered into grains of sand. At will, he can change from a solid man into the gritty monster Sandman; he can even meld with other forms of earth and make himself gigantic. But what exactly are his motives? I ask this because he was crafted as a sympathetic character: despite having done bad things to people, his only concern is the well being of his young daughter, who's apparently quite ill (with what is never revealed). What makes the situation worse is that he was responsible for the death of Parker's uncle. This ignites a rage within Parker, and it only gets stronger when the black space slime finally makes contact. Not only does it attach itself to his Spider suit, turning it black, it also intensifies Parker's aggression and fuels his hatred. It also makes him arrogant during normal daily life, an aspect that's more comical than serious.<br /><br />The fourth test is rival photographer, Eddie Brock, Jr. (Topher Grace), who threatens Parker's position at the "Daily Bugle." Loud-mouthed Editor in Chief J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) offers a desk job to anyone who can capture an incriminating photo of Spider-Man; this paves the way for a number of circumstances that eventually turn Brock and Parker into bitter enemies. I distinctly remember a scene in a church, in which Brock prays that God murder Parker. How heavy-handed for a superhero story: it could have been humorous had the atmosphere not been so intense. And it gets even more intense when he comes into contact with a bit of the black space goo; it turns him into the vile super villain known as Venom.<br /><br />The fifth and final test is Harry Osborn (James Franco), whose rage over the death of his father is deepening. Having since discovered the true identity of Spider-Man, he now vows to destroy Peter Parker, his former best friend. Not only does he fight with Parker as the New Goblin, he also forces M.J. to break up with Parker. At this point in the story, it's becomes obvious that revenge is the main theme. Granted, this isn't an original idea (consider "Batman"). However, hidden beneath the vengeful layers is the possibility of forgiveness, and that alone made this film a lot more enjoyable. By the time we get to the climactic battle at a construction site (reminiscent of Raimi's own "Darkman"), the audience will discover who can let go of the past and who will remain stuck in the depths of hate.<br /><br />And yes, they'll be treated to a number of impressive battle sequences, all of which rely heavily on computer generated imagery. I purposely avoided elaborating on this; despite being prominently featured, "Spider-Man 3" is about more than its eye candy; it's about balancing its eye candy with its human story. Generally speaking, it worked quite well (I exempt a dance sequence at a jazz club; talk about unnecessary). In fact, the entire "Spider-Man" series worked quite well, and with that, I have only one more thing to say: if you liked the first two, you'll definitely like the third.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KAR9G699RM56.html">A1KAR9G699RM56</a><br/><p>As the story progresses from Spiderman 2, we see a sprite Peter Parker prepared to propose, and a glum Mary Jane, struggling as an actress unbeknown to Peter.  Then we see Peter's and MJ's friend, Harry, once again try to assault Peter, only to lose his memory in the process, and make a return to old times.  Additionally, Peter's schoolwork is excellent, but he's got competition at the office from a young hotshot Eddie Brock Jr., whose all to eager to get a scoop.  Then, we have Thomas Haden Church's character or Flint Marko in the story, running from jail, while still trying to get money for his daughter's medical needs, only to find himself turned into the Sandman early on in the film.  Peter finds out from the police that actually Marko was the one to kill Ben, and soon enough, all of these stories intertwine.<br /><br />I introduce the film this way one, to be free of spoilers, and two, because in reality the greatest downfall of the film is the entanglement of all the stories together, into what appears to be a relatively coordinated mess.  Mind you I do still like the film, but in this one, I wanted to get my complaint out there early.<br /><br />Now for my praise, as I felt that even with all of the crossing of story-lines, I did feel a sympathetic ear for the characters, as was intended.  Especially since, more then ever with the introduction of the symbiote, Peter Parker/(the Black Spider) takes a dark turn, and starts ruining his life, among others.  Thus, we were allowed to learn about all the characters, even if there were so many different characters.<br /><br />Which actually brings me to another complaint, and that's the unnecessary emphasis of Peter Parker's cockiness.  For instance, there's at least a five-minute scene where Peter's just strutting on the street, and sure we get he's changed, but this is quite worthless a scene.<br /><br />All in all, while the movie ran a little long, and definitely earned some of its negativity, I personally enjoyed the film, and that's all I can say when the lights go up.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>Clocking in at an interminable two hours and twenty minutes, "Spider-Man 3" is a movie desperately in need of some serious streamlining.  There is such a plethora of characters, plotlines, villains and monsters - all vying for attention and getting in each others' way in the process - that the movie feels as if it has been assembled by a committee rather than having arisen from a single artist's organic vision.<br /><br />The ostensible selling point of "Spider-Man 3" is that the meek and mild-mannered Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) dons a mysterious black suit that suddenly turns him into a heartless, cranky bad guy.  The suit, which is actually a creepy-crawly creature from outer space that changes the personality of whomever it clings to, is only one of four villains Spidey has to contend with here - in as clear a case of malefactor overload as we've encountered in quite some time.  No wonder Spider-Man looks so worn out (we seriously thought it might just be the by-product of sequel fatigue).  The other foes include his friend, Harry Osborn, aka New Goblin (James Franco), who still believes Parker was responsible for his father`s death ("old" Goblin, if anybody`s keeping track); Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), the actual murderer of Parker`s uncle who has been transformed into a giant killer sandman; and a cocky little newspaper photographer, Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), who is determined to snap a photo of Spider-Man doing something bad so as to tarnish the superhero`s hitherto sterling reputation around town (Brock becomes a victim of the dark suit as well).<br /><br />One would think that with all this occupying the hero, the scenarists (Ivan Raimi, Alvin Sargent and writer/director Sam Raimi) wouldn`t have much time left over for romantic entanglements, but one would be wrong in that assumption, for a great deal of the film is devoted to the relationship between Parker and his girlfriend, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), who has become a tremendously needy, whiney and self-pitying character in this installment.  In fact, so tedious is the romance this time around that whatever charisma and charm Maguire and Dunst exuded as a couple in the previous two films has been completely wiped out on this occasion.  While I must concede that they are both tremendously likable actors, I think they may have gone once too often to the well with these particular roles.  Maguire's impossibly sweet and good-natured demeanor has become particularly annoying at this point (although he isn`t all that convincing when he`s trying to play the bad-boy villain either).<br /><br />I've never been much of a fan of Spider-Man, either in comic book form or in the movies, but one of the reasons why "Spider-Man 2" worked as a film and the others haven't is because, in that movie, Parker's crippling self-doubts about whether or not he was really cut out to be a superhero gave a depth to the character that was psychologically sound and which made it easy for the audience to identify with him.  In "Spider-Man 3," however, Parker essentially has his "evil" thrust upon him from an outside source and, thus, that key psychological dimension is now lacking.  Instead, the filmmakers have decided to really turn on the waterworks in this film, with just about everybody breaking down in tears at one point or another, culminating in an ending so syrupy and sappy that both dieters and diabetics should probably leave the theater a good fifteen minutes before the close of the story.<br /><br />That pretty much leaves the special effects, which run the gamut from decent (they still haven't really figured out how to make Spider-Man's "flying" very convincing on screen) to spectacular (the Sandman is a really cool creature, indeed).  The fight scenes are impressively hectic and noisy (which may explain the headache I developed halfway through the film), but it is rather difficult to develop much of a personal rooting interest in the outcome when a group of what are essentially invincible figures are battling it out for supremacy.  And talk about villain overkill!<br /><br />With "Spider-Man 3," the superhero's movie batting-average drops from an impressive .500 to a middling .333.  Let's hope he can raise it back up the next time he steps up to the plate.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Going into this one, I was wondering if Sam Raimi would be able to top himself in the wake of his magnus opus SPIDER-MAN 2. Bluntly, the answer is no. But, listen, SPIDER-MAN 3 is still very much worth dropping your hard-earned dollars for. SPIDEY 2 was a five star film, this one rates as a four starrer and remains a quintessentially fun summer blockbuster picture.<br /><br />The special effects are seamless. CG Venom and the Sandman look great, while CG Spidey continues to astound. Admittedly, I wasn't too impressed with how the Goblin looked. You really gotta hand it to Sam Raimi, he knows how to handle epic superhero battles. In various fabulous faceoffs, Spidey takes on the Goblin, the Sandman, and Venom and, each time, our hero doesn't walk away without leaving a piece of himself on the floor. Even though we knew Spidey was going to come out on top, the fight scenes are credible and effective enough that he seems to be the underdog in each encounter. I have absolutely no complaints with the Spidey sequences.<br /><br />SPIDER-MAN 3 is again very well served with returning supporting actors J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson (hilarious!) and the sexy Elizabeth Banks as Betty Brant (more, please). Sam Raimi's buddy, Bruce Campbell, has a funny bit as a Maitre d', Mageina Tovah as the landlord's daughter brightens up the room with her endearing if skeletal presence, Stan Lee provides the obligatory cameo ('nuff said), Bryce Dallas Howard is essentially wasted as Gwen Stacy, and Rosemary Harris is the usual boring fount of wisdom.<br /><br />Folks have already mentioned the overstacking of supervillains and the onerousness of the multiple plot stories. I say, "Phooey" to that. I was able to track every story arc with ease and keep up with every character. In my opinion, the villains are drawn with just enough depth and are given ample back stories. By virtue of having been in every film installment, Harry Osbourne comes off as the most layered antagonist. James Franco, whom I normally dislike, is very good here. Flint Marko, aka The Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), is immediately revealed to be a sympathetic character as the audience, early on, becomes privy to his core motivation. Eddie Brock (a puny and miscast Topher Grace), however, is just plain bad egg. Now, there's a chance that newcomers to the Spidey mythos might be befuddled with the abrupt introduction of the inky, wriggly alien symbiote. Furthermore, Raimi then ignores the symbiote for lengthy film moments, opting to leave it in residence at Peter's cramped apartment to bide its time. Raimi is seemingly relying on the fans' knowledge of the alien costume to carry the day in lieu of actually sketching out some sort of a backstory. Not that there's much of a backstory on it in the comic book source. SECRET WARS, anyone?<br /><br />Hands down, Spidey's my favorite superhero. Like a host of kids, of the plethora of superheroes, it's Peter Parker with whom I identified the most when I was a mere tadpole. What makes him such a rootable underdog character is that Stan Lee and the ensuing comic book writers portrayed him as a sensitive teen/young man with relatable dilemmas who ekes out small victories in life even as he trounces heinous superbaddies. This film strays away from what makes him so likable. The start of SPIDER-MAN 3 finds a smug Peter Parker as Spiderman has become the toast of New York. His image is displayed on giant monitors and he is lauded in the newspapers (excepting the Bugle, of course). He even is presented with the key to the city. This same scene also comes up with an act by Peter as Spidey which is blatantly disrespectful towards Mary Jane. In fact, the success of his Spider-Man persona blinds him to what's going on with Mary Jane, whose career isn't flowing as smoothly. Understandibly, it's not too long before M.J. begins to feel that Peter isn't there for her. Suffice it to say, while I loved every Spidey sequence, there are moments here where I genuinely did not like Peter Parker.<br /><br />Or put another way, my dissatisfaction with Peter is actually a nod towards Kirsten Dunst's very effective performance. She's easily the best actor in this film and is so likable as Mary Jane that every thoughtless act by Peter towards her exacerbated my resentment towards the dude. I'm just not kosher with plotlines necessitating my hero to act like an obtuse jerk. And, since I'm crapping on the poor guy, I must say the hairstyle he chooses when under the symbiote's influence is less than cool. If it was supposed to emphasize his dark turn, it failed miserably, and the film, in my eyes, lost some credibility. The audience, including me, burst out laughing every time that goofy downswept hairstyle popped up. Unintended laughter - it's not a good thing.<br /><br />But I want to reiterate: Spider-Man is my favorite superhero. He got me thru junior high school (middle school, to you youngsters) and high school. I hated to criticize this movie, but it would've been wrong to merely leave it as a glowing review and to ignore the warts. Yet, with its flaws, SPIDER-MAN 3 is still very much a sensational movie, and I do feel that, ultimately, its positives outweigh the negatives. Tobey Maguire is the definitive Peter Parker, no matter what. I can't really envision anyone else in that role. Dunst, as always, is superlative and very lovely and oozes acting talent. The complex story, in spite of hitting a few false notes, did keep me involved. The action scenes are eyepopping, nothing at all wrong with them. Sam Raimi playfully continues to throw in insane gag bits and incidental, low key humor (for some reason, I like the doorknob bit). There's even several brief dance numbers, and it's up to you to laugh and go with it or groan and grouse. Most, hopefully, will do the former.</p></br><a href="../users/A18RQ2URRGIIEA.html">A18RQ2URRGIIEA</a><br/><p>For the third installment of the "Spider-Man" film franchise that was released in 2007, director Sam Raimi (who directed the first two "Spider-Man" films in 2002 and 2004) also took on the role of screenwriter.  While Raimi is no stranger to taking on both roles, 15 years had elapsed since the last time he both directed and wrote a film, and that was for the 1992 horror/comedy "Army of Darkness", which was part of the ongoing "Evil Dead" film franchise.  Assisting Raimi in writing the screenplay for "Spider-Man 3" was his brother Ivan, who also cowrote "Army of Darkness" in 1992, but had not done any writing since his involvement as a writer in the very short-lived (13 episodes) 1997 TV series called "Spy Game".  Assisting the brothers in writing "Spider-Man 3" screenplay was writer Alvin Sargent, who wrote the screenplay for the 2004 "Spider-Man 2"; but it was the Raimi brothers who took full credit for writing the "Spider-Man 3" screen story.  Thus, unlike the first two "Spider-Man" films, "Spider-Man 3" was predominantly a Sam & Ivan Raimi effort; and the results were rather disappointing:  whereas the plot & characters of the first two films were interesting & engaging, neither can be said for the characters & plot of the third film.<br /><br />The film begins with Peter Parker, alias Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire), planning to propose to his long-time love Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) after she is highly criticized for her role in a musical play and is subsequently replaced.  Being totally oblivious to Mary Jane's pain over this for the entire film, Peter is instead preoccupied with his own ego & glory when the city of New York presents him with an award.  In the meantime, an escaped criminal, Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), is accidentally transformed into the Sandman while fleeing police; and Harry Osborn (James Franco) is bent on destroying Peter/Spider-Man because of his father.  Later, Peter becomes the host to an alien symbiont creature that brings out the worst in Peter & Spider-Man; but he manages to separate himself from the creature only for it to join with a photography rival, Edward 'Eddie' Brock (Topher Grace), who becomes a new nemesis for Spider-Man named Venom.<br /><br />Thus, Raimi made the third installment of "Spider-Man" have three criminals: the Sandman, Harry as the new Goblin, and Venom.  On the surface, this sounds exciting; but in writing an engaging & character-driven plot, this becomes a liability when providing sufficient background & screen time to develop three completely separate characters, each of which must do battle with Spider-Man, as well as provide sufficient screen time to develop the relationship between Peter & Mary Jane.  The result: a plot weakened by too many antagonists, inadequate character development for the antagonists, and the unfortunate transformation of Peter from an engaging protagonist in the first two films to a non-engaging one in the third.  Especially damaging to Peter's character were the jazz club dance scene and his attempt at acting cool on the sidewalk (albeit under the influence of the alien symbiant), that not only turned the heads of bystanders (film extras) on the streets of New York in disgust, but many members of the audience as well.  So, in spite of lavish special effects of Spider-Man swinging his way through New York and doing battle with his three foes, the disjoint relationship between Peter & Mary Jane take away from the excitement of the final climatic battle, as well as the loss of interest already felt by many in the audience by the time the climax occurs.<br /><br />With great special effects & wonderful cinematography, but a poor plot and non-engaging characters, I can only rate "Spider-Man 3" with 2 out of 5 stars.  A fourth film has been announced with Stan Lee as executive producer, but no announcements have been made regarding who will direct, write or act in this proposed 2009 release as the contracts that Tobey Maguire & Kirsten Dunst signed were only for three "Spider-Man" films.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>The epic hubris displayed by director Sam Raimi in this latest (and one would hope final) installment of his phenomenally successful Spider-Man series is what frustrates me the most about this overlong, CGI-saturated 2007 movie. It feels like he was given free reign to do whatever he wanted without the intrusion of common sense. The result is a megalomaniacal failure leavened by scattered moments of levity. Written by Raimi, along with his brother Ivan and veteran screenwriter Alvin Sargent, the story begins promisingly with Peter Parker, a.k.a. Spider-Man, regaling in his celebrity status and mustering up enough courage up to propose to longtime love Mary-Jane Watson, who is incredibly making her Broadway musical debut.<br /><br />The film wastes little time in establishing that Peter's ego has run amok - obviously an ironic parallel to Raimi's situation - and that he will be forced to face a crisis of conscience amid the shenanigans of not one but three villains. Spelling out the motivations of each of these characters takes time, as does the resuscitation of the love triangle between Peter, Mary-Jane and Harry Osborn and Peter's guilt over how he responded to his Uncle Ben's murder. Consequently, the movie feels overstuffed by the multiple storylines that only coalesce through pat plot conventions executed toward the end in order for the movie to have an acceptable running time. Moreover, the novelty of the special effects has tangibly worn out since the initial outing, and there is a surprising technical laziness found in some of the action sequences, especially with the overuse of nighttime shots to camouflage some of the battles.<br /><br />A key problem also lies in the divergent yet predictable ways the villains have been developed. The resuscitated Green Goblin represents the result of revenge, while Flint Marko is a petty criminal caught in a radiation field that turns him into Sandman, a burgeoning creature made of sand (probably the film's best CGI sequence). The most skimpily developed villain is Venom, a gloopy, fast-moving black parasite that takes hold of Peter first before it takes control of professional rival Eddie Brock. If this was not enough, the story also introduces another key female character, model Gwen Stacy who happens to be the daughter of the police chief and Mary-Jane's competition for Peter's affections. All these detours serve to bring Peter to his original sensibilities about being Spider-Man and of course, to the big climactic battle. This is perhaps the most disappointing portion of the movie as at least two far-fetched plot points undermine the dramatic tension and seem to emphasize the silliness of the entire venture.<br /><br />In keeping with its comic book origins, Raimi infuses the movie with a sense of humor, but the resulting variability in tone threatens to submerge the movie into camp. The principal actors - Tobey Maguire as Peter, Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane and James Franco as Harry - are back but give us little additional depth or texture to their characters. Broadway luminary Rosemary Harris is also back lending sage advice as Aunt May, as are J.K. Simmons as blowhard editor J. Jonah Jameson, Elizabeth Banks as saucy Miss Brant and Dylan Baker as the all-knowing Dr. Connors. Thomas Haden Church plays Marko stoically, while Topher Grace is simply irritating as the obnoxious Brock. Bryce Dallas Howard lends the right vacuity to air-headed Gwen, while Theresa Russell is wasted in a cameo as Marko's defeated wife. This is one dismal blockbuster worth skipping.</p></br></body></html>

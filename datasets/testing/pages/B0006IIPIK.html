OK, I don't think anybody out there will call it "great," but it is definitely unique.  The type of person who will hate it, I think, is the one who has know love (or knowledge) of the pop-culture of yesteryear.  Let me put it this way - if you've never seen the original King Kong, you're not going to like this film.<br /><br />I was reminded of King Kong all the way through Sky Captain.  The film tries to capture the sense of wonder from depression-era sci-fi.  It takes place in an alternate history where the Hindenburg III blimp docks at the Empire State Building.  Everything is art deco - huge open spaces are the norm.<br /><br />It's true, the story should have been better - there is little dramatic tension because everything is so tongue-in-cheek, you don't really take anything on screen seriously.  But, in the end, this film is all about look - and it looks great.</p></br><a href="../users/AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ.html">AGU2ZGUBFCJTJ</a><br/><p>Looking back in time you would think the Americans of the 1920s and 1930s were nuts when it came to concepts of the world of tomorrow. To many scientists of the modern day, these "visions of the future" are clumsy, primitive and na?ve but to young children, and even some older readers, these were a form of escape from the less-enthralling realism of the post-World War I depression era that consumed the country at the time. Science would soon blend with the comic-book/science fiction world creating such astounding superheroes as Superman, Flash Gordon, and Buck Rodgers. This concept would eventually spill over into the realm of the movies, spawning now classic films such as The Invisible Man, The Island of Lost Souls, King Kong, and many more. Today, we look back upon these films, often laughing at the now amusing concepts and clich&eacute;d situations, but at the same time feeling a bit nostalgia for a time when things seemed, at least in our minds now, a bit simpler then they are now.<br /><br />The story for Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow takes the futuristic visions of the world as dreamed up in the science-fiction comic books of the 1950s and brings them to life in brilliant style and texture. Though the world seems brighter and better then ever after the horrible events of World War I and the Great Depression, danger still loams on the horizon. Scientists, who were part of an underground doomsday project created before the outbreak of the First World War, are mysteriously disappearing from across the world - six have already been abducted, with the seventh highly aware of his dire situation and looking for safe haven. He soon comes into contact with the ambitious Polly Perkins, an adamant reporter for The Chronicle, and tells her the identity of the mastermind behind a serious of raids on the city conducted by gigantic mechanical robots - Dr. Totenkopf, the same devilishly brilliant scientist behind the organization of the doomsday project. After receiving this startling information, she then pays a visit to an old friend, Sky Captain and his mercenary fighter pilots known as the Flying Legion, who may be the world's only hope from absolute destruction. The story for Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is more then simply a vision of "the future that never was", at least outside the realm of comic-books, but offers an enthralling storyline combined with a rousing musical score, entertaining performances, and stunning action sequences, all balanced together in a well-formulated film-noir style of filmmaking. Is it jammed packed with clich&eacute;s and unrealistic situations? Of course it is and that's what makes this film one of the most pleasant surprises of the year, namely for the fact that those clich&eacute;s are actually used to help it achieve a level of entertainment that is so rarely seen in modern cinema.<br /><br />Another keen move by first-time director Kerry Conran was to enlist as few high profile performers as possible in order to keep the actions of the film centralized on the two leads, namely Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow. Though some may have dispute with some of their past performances, kudos must be given to these two for carrying this entire experimental project on their shoulders and for doing it as ideally as they did. Jude Law fits flawlessly into the role of flying ace Sky Captain and pulls off a performance reminiscent of Harrison Ford's in the Indiana Jones series, though with far less prestige and anticipation then Ford's signature role. Even the character himself gives off the suggestion that he might be a direct takeoff on the famous archeologist but perhaps that's what makes the movie all the more attractive and ultimately more enjoyable. Gwyneth Paltrow also gives a commendable performance, though slightly less savoring then Law's but, then again, that was expected considering he is the hero of the film. And Michael Gambon, who recently took over the role of Professor Dumbledore in the immensely popular Harry Potter series, makes a slight appearance in the film as the editor of the Chronicle. His character isn't exceptionally important to the overall storyline but it was just good to see him on screen once again, at least for those who enjoyed the Singing Detective television episodes. There are two minor complaints when it comes to the area of performances in this film: the first being the most blatantly obvious one, that the actors frequently gave some stilted, wood-like performances in particular sequences, but this was to be as expected after the some-what bumbling work that appeared in Star Wars - Episode II: Attack of the Clones. The other issue being the role of Angelina Jolie, more specifically the character of Franky Cook. Whether this is the fault of the advertising department or the filmmakers, Jolie's role was built up as this prominent co-starring role when in actuality it's nothing more then a mere cameo. One can say that they may be holding up on the character in order to broaden her role in any sequels, or quite possible prequels, should this film prove to be a success. These two aren't what would be called "deal breakers" for this film; rather they are just minor annoyances that merely need to be addressed.<br /><br />Overall, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow rattles the box office from its usual post-Labor Day slumber and brings about an experience that can best be described as this generation's Raiders of the Lost Ark. The feature's obvious draw will be its astonishing special effects (seriously, the entire film is done in computer animation, with the exception of the actors of course) but thankfully the film relies on a cleverly-crafted script to back it up, rather then depending on a one-trick pony to simply get butts in the seats. Some individuals may go into this film with the impression that it will end up being nothing more then a clich&eacute;d special effects extravaganza and, in one respect, they would be right but what separates this film from the rest of the trash that has been cluttering the movie theaters for the past few weeks is that Sky Captain has created its own separate identity and hasn't simply cut-and-pasted ideas from the competition. The script, though not absolutely believable, does what it's suppose to do and that's namely to entertain audiences without going so over the top so that it becomes ridiculous and not worth your time. And what could one ask for more then a villain who comes off as an extremist social-liberal wacko who believes mankind is doomed to destroy itself and should be punished for ruining the planet and filling the world with hatred? Sure this guy may be a god to the left-wing fringe of the Hollywood elite, namely everyone but Mel Gibson and Bruce Willis, but we all know better. Should this film prove to be a success at the box office, it would not be surprising in the least to see this bud into an affluent franchise in the not too distant future, something of high demand from the movie-going public with The Lord of the Rings now done and over with and Harry Potter possibly on the ropes. Bottom-line, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow may not be everyone's cup of magnesia milk but for those tired of sequels and the same old tired retreads, this is the film for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A20ZFWGBY4REFX.html">A20ZFWGBY4REFX</a><br/><p>I have seen the highly anticipated "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" at the theaters for the second time in a row, and the film was nothing short of amazing! It was like nothing that I've ever seen in a film before until now, especially since "Sky Captain" has lots of action and thrills that never let up for a minute! The direction of first-time director Kerry Conran was magnificient! The performances of superstars Jude Law ("Cold Mountain") and Gwyneth Paltrow ("A Perfect Murder") were outstanding and top-notch! (The last time that Law and Paltrow appeared in a film together was in 1999's "The Talented Mr. Ripley", with Matt Damon.) Joining them are Oscar-winner Angelina Jolie (The "Tomb Raider" films), Giovanni Ribisi ("Flight of the Phoenix"), Michael Gambon ("Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"), and Bai Ling ("Red Corner") in which they gave great performances as well.<br /><br />"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" focuses on an intrepid reporter named Polly Perkins (Paltrow). Polly discovers that famous scientists are disappearing from around the world. During an encounter with one of the potential victims, there are a bunch of giant robots parading across the streets, destroying everything in their way. Polly sees the scientists' disappearances and the attacks of the robots as some sort of a connection, and she teams up with her old flame/avation officer Joe "Sky Captain" Sullivan (Law), the captain of a mercenary legion of pilots. Joe and Polly are investigating the case when the robots attack the city yet again, though in a stroke of luck, Joe/Sky Captain's right-hand man, Dex (Ribisi), manages to locate the source of the strange goings-on. Joe and Polly then travel around the world to find the evil Dr. Totenkopf (played by the late Sir Laurence Olivier, in a cameo via manipulated video footage), who is bent on creating a utopia of his own, a "World of Tomorrow", and destroy the world of today! And the world's only hope lies in the hands of Joe and Polly, along with the help of Joe's comrade, Capt. Franky Cook (Jolie), as they try to thwart Totenkopf's evil plans before it's the end of the world for them!<br /><br />Jude Law, who plays the title character with charming, silk-scarf nonchalance, is likely to linger in the memory with the staying power of Indiana Jones. Gwyneth Paltrow's Polly Perkins character, however, has the makings of a Lois Lane-type character with enduring appeal. In their own ways, the characters are interchangeable with the appliances they battle, each a collection of attitudes and foibles. (Joe cricks his neck manfully before engaging in combat; Polly is prone to pouting as an expression of sexual tension.) But while they are busy saving the world -- an assignment that takes them to Nepal, Shangri-La, and beneath the sea -- Paltrow and Law fit snugly and happily in front of the bluescreen on which director Conran and his production designer (and brother), Kevin Conran, have built their entirely CG dream universe, in which actual sets are obsolete. And when Law and Paltrow are joined by Angelina Jolie, sporting a kinky black eye patch and a fetish-compatible tight uniform as Capt. Franky Cook, the confection is irresistible: three of Hollywood's most polished stars, assuming the contours of 2-D characters without irony or condescension.<br /><br />And they never forget their silver-screen roots. "I'm late for a movie," Polly tells her editor (Gambon, in a sly tip of the felt brim to his noir masterpiece, "The Singing Detective") as she hurries off to an interview a source at Radio City Music Hall. On the Music Hall screen, Dorothy is just realizing that she's not in Kansas anymore. This couldn't have happened; "The Wizard of Oz" never played in Radio City, another smooshing of fact and fiction, as is having the late Laurence Olivier "play" the evil wizard Dr. Totenkopf through the magic of pixels. Indeed, for all the grandeur of "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" visible on screen, hidden in behind-the-scenes technical specs, and audible in the stirring, enveloping score of Edward Shearmur, it's the little, low-tech grace notes that stand out. I love that Dex, Sky Captain's trusty, tinkering sidekick, chews gum like an all-American boy. That Polly's charm bracelet becomes a liability. And that Frank barks "Alert the Amphibious Squad!" Ooh, yes, please do! we reply, bouncing with happiness.<br /><br />In conclusion, "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" has it all: thrilling action, laugh-out-loud humor, an excellent plot, groundbreaking special and visual effects, and a great soundtrack as well! This is Jude Law's best film since "A.I.: Artificial Intelligence" and "Cold Mountain"; Gwyneth Paltrow's best film since "Shallow Hal" and "A Perfect Murder"; and Angelina Jolie's best film since the "Tomb Raider" films and "Gone in 60 Seconds". Truly a DVD must-have when released, there will be no other film quite like "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"!</p></br><a href="../users/AHIK7BUXFRMT8.html">AHIK7BUXFRMT8</a><br/><p>As a boy growing up in the 1930's I can still vividly remember my excitement on Saturday mornings as my dad would take me to our local theater for the Saturday morning fun club. There would be a feature film plus a shorter cliff-hanger serial that would leave the hero in a life threatening situation which was not resolved until the next installment the following Saturday morning.<br /><br />It was there I saw my first Buck Rogers serial and I was hooked for life on science fiction. It was not until the Second World War that I would discover sci-fi pulp magazines. The Boy Scouts would collect waste paper for the war effort and I discovered science fiction pulp magazines; I was so excited by that discovery that I would keep every copy that came my way and read and re-read them.<br /><br />My wife tells me that when we married one of the few things I owned was my treasured collection of sci-fi pulp magazines; sadly they somehow disappeared as some of those are now worth a lot of money.<br /><br />I mention that because this movie reminded me of that era and those serials and those pulp magazines. The magazines always had lurid covers of space ships, heroes, villains, and space monsters enough to satisfy the imagination of almost any young boy. This movie does a marvelous job of capturing the emotions generated by those magazines and movies.<br /><br />It communicated powerfully with my memories of those times and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. Although there are fewer of us now, if you are one who can share my memories of that bygone era, I encourage you to get this movie. If you're of a younger generation and can free your imagination I suspect you'll be able to enjoy it too.<br /><br />For the record I'm still a dedicated sci-fi fan and enjoy an extensive collection of books and movies.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>The film is a gumbo mix of adventures that resemble a 1940's War Film, Star Trek, Indiana Jones and Wizard of Oz.  There is much action and adventure for a light plot, but the stars, Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie give the weak plot a boost and the cinematography is beyond reproach.<br /><br />Kerry Conran is the director and writer -  this is his first film. The retro touches of old brands like Double Bubble Gum and Coca Cola gave it a nostalgic touch.  The hero is Joe Sullivan "Sky Captain" (Jude Law) who is a pilot.  His former flame, Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltro) comes back into his life.  She makes a deal with him for a story in her newspaper.<br /><br />The mystery and plot surround a group of missing scientists and recent robot attacks on New York City.  There is an intricate scheme that may cause the end of the world.  It involves a spacecraft that will send two of each earth species into space - a Noah's Arc Star Liner of sorts.<br /><br />The beauty of the film makes the simple plot watchable.  Gorgeous visuals and special effects give a simple nostalgic effect.  You often think the stars resemble the likes of Clark Gable, Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacal, Veronica Lake depending on the scenes.  There are smart lines that remind you of the era of Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon and their tin can space ships.  The movie is done mostly in burnished browns with light color showing through.  Facial close-ups must have camera filters and lighting is perfect.  It is clearly mostly computer generated, but well done art and creativity throughout.<br /><br />For a adventure filled action film, with retro touches, and top stars, this is a good pick.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VJ80PM1G00QV.html">A2VJ80PM1G00QV</a><br/><p>If the concept of an action filled comic book style adventure leaves you cold avoid this picture. If it can amuse and entertain you, then this will be satisfying. The characters are consistent, well formed, and authentic within the logic of its generic type; that is, they act logically in terms of the premise. Stunts are quite well done while the hardware is anything but penny-board masquerading as space ships. All looks as it should look in such an adventure. I have no idea of which age and sex groups it will most interest, but is is certain to have wide appeal.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>Wow, what an amazing visual film. Being someone who loves cinematography and artwork in general, I acquired this film quickly after hearing about it. I wasn't disappointed, except for the story which was just so-so.<br /><br />Almost the whole film is computerized and almost has a painting-like look to it. In fact, many scenes look as if Edward Hopper had painted them. Yet, it is a live-action movie with real actors whose faces aren't altered, except for Gywneth Paltrow's hair which is made more blondish and shimmering.<br /><br />Story-wise, it's nothing special, just a corny old-time serial story about someone using high-tech robots and spaceships to take over the planet. The time period, however, is pre-World War II so to see this futuristic type of robot is a bit of a stretch. Nonetheless, it's a strictly old-fashioned sci-fi story with little profanity and, except for the robots, a great retro look.<br /><br />Going back to that "look," this film is still very worthy of viewing because it's absolutely stunning to see. There truly is nothing quite like it. I'm sorry it didn't do well at the box office because that won't encourage others to make more of these visually-inventive kind of films. This must look beyond incredible on an expensive plasma TV set!<br /><br />Also notable is the sound. The better the sound system you have, the more you will be blown away with the audio here. It's as good as the visuals. If only the story was as good!</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>This film looks so beautiful.  I just wish that I liked it more.  Done almost entirely with blue screen, the actors really had their job cut out for them imagining all of the crazy things going on around them.  If you have ever seen the old seriels of Flash Gordon, this is very much the style of the movie.  Set in 1939, with strange future gadgets that seem a little silly now.  Sort of like when you watch the old Star Trek series with the ship being operated by a lot of knobs and dials when we know now that it won't be that way whenever we acheive that ability.  While Sky Captain is ambitious, it just falls flat for me and didn't rouse me into really caring for the characters and story.  This one is worth renting once to see the beautiful effects.  I would wait to purchase until after you have given it a watch.</p></br><a href="../users/AYQF4Z1EQDACU.html">AYQF4Z1EQDACU</a><br/><p>When Scientists have disapeared and giant robots have invaded our world, we needed a hero and the one man with the heroic effort to save us is "SKY CAPTAIN" Jude Law stars as Joe Sullivan AKA Sky Captain, the dashing young hero, Gwyneth Paltrow as Polly Perkins, the intepred reporter of the Chroncile and Angelia Jolie as Franseca "Franky" naval officer of an all women's navy in "SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW.

Enjoy this SC-FI treat and what SC-FI serials where like in the 1930s-the World of Tomorrow, TODAY.</p></br><a href="../users/AL5OEDM8TPTKV.html">AL5OEDM8TPTKV</a><br/><p>One of the things I remember hearing about this movie before I saw it in the theaters was that it was all done with actors working in front of a blue screen. That little fact never really sunk in the entire time I was watching the film, not until I watched the "making of" documentary on the DVD. And now, I believe this is one of one of the most revolutionary, amazing films made.<br /><br />Sky Captain is a throw back to old adventure films of the 30's, a confident hero with a jaded past, a perfect reporter dying to get the scoop, a gum-popping best friend with a penchant for inventions, and a one-eyed general who's a tough dame. Set in New York City around the end of the 1930's, it's equally recognizable and not. A passenger blimp docks at the Empire State with a mysterious doctor on board, who summons Polly to a meeting at Radio City during a showing of the Wizard of Oz. She starts the mystery, only to be interrupted by flying machines attacking the Big Apple, which brings in our hero, and the adventure starts.<br /><br />There isn't a wasted moment or scene in this entire film. Trading character development for plot movement, the story treks along at breakneck speed, spinning a great yarn in the process. The acting, done in front of that blue screen, is phenomenal. Both Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow pull off the impossible, making us believe they are seeing what we are. Angelina Jolie plays her spoiler part well, offering a sultriness to a somewhat stern character. Another unsung actor hero is Giovanni Ribisi, playing best friend Dex, who truly embodies the innocent charm of movie characters of the 30's.<br /><br />However, all of this adds up to nothing if the visual effects weren't effective. And fortunately, they are not only effective, but they blow away the entire film. The look of this picture is unlike anything seen before, thanks to primary visionary Kerry Coran and his team of cohorts. Dark, sepia tones, magnificent special effects, incredible use of light and shadow all adds up to a visual feast never seen on cinema before.<br /><br />It astonishes me how the Oscars this year skipped over this film, maybe perhaps it will be recognized in its technical achievement. In the years to come, it will serve as a benchmark in movie making.</p></br><a href="../users/AS558SNWF1DXG.html">AS558SNWF1DXG</a><br/><p>This is an extremely anachronistic yarn that reminds me of a Guy Maddin movie for two reasons.<br /><br />It borrows the colors, camera angles, whipes, dissolves, designs and tone of an old German expressionist movie and it also seems to be specifically for people who love film and can identify the homages being paid here. I'm not sure why they did it, exactly, but I'm glad they did and I'm glad they dove in, unapologetically, and made this beautifully artificial machine that has heaps of heart and humor, even if the heart exists entirely in binary code.<br /><br />"Sky Captain" also pays great nods to the old Superman matinee cartoons, Orson Welles and both "Indiana Jones" and the myriad influences that made Indy possible in the first place.<br /><br />A strange and wonderful experiment that won't be for everyone but that manages to outweigh its indulgence with sheer stylistic audacity. Oh, and it's also a lot of fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A15G70V9OBTOVO.html">A15G70V9OBTOVO</a><br/><p>When they pulled the summer release of Sky Captain I had a hunch it was a dog. But I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Certainly the most fully formed vision of a world that never was since Blade Runner or perhaps The Fifth Element.  The obvious comparisons would be to the dreadful Rocketeer or the depressing Dark City (interestingly, both with Jennifer Connally who would have really made this a show stopper!)<br /><br />For those who don't get it this is a high tech retread of 1930s  art, movies and cartoons.  Just as Star Wars was a Flash Gordon/Buck Rogers ripoff, Sky Captain is based on a series of 30's motifs.  Specifically, the robots are from the Max Fleischer Superman Cartoon, "The Mechanical Monsters" (Paltrow is dressed as the Lois Lane character)  The landing decks in the sky were pictured in Popular Science.  Angela Jolie's group, her rocket belt, the rocket  "ark" and the hover craft are from Things To Come (with a dash of When Worlds Collide).  And the  giant figure at the end, holding the sword, must have been traced from the Tarna sequence in Heavy Metal.  Throw in Lost Horizon and a pinch of The Day The Earth Stood Still and you've got it.<br /><br />But somehow it all works.  Its stylish and I found it suprisingly fun.  There is so much detail it will be fun to examine it on DVD.  Why not 5 stars?  Because it was a little too long.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QEATH3NODFM.html">A38QEATH3NODFM</a><br/><p>An interesting film that came out a few years ago, sky captain and the world of tommorrow was a film I had wrote off as something that would be rediculous.  Now that i took the chance to watch it, I am actually suprised, It was kind of entertaining. This movie is based on the concept of what people may have thought future technologies would have looked like in the late 1930's .  It reminds me of a flash gordon tale, or of some of the old Superman cartoons.  Sky captain Joe and his former reporter girlfriend Polly find themselves in the middle of the doomsday plan, and they are the only ones that can stop it. Right from the begining, the effects and cinemetograph is unique, seeming similar to what was used in the recent King Kong movie of last winter.  The effects are what you would expect, many computer generated blue screen shots, but I enjoyed that many of the ships,planes and machines where thing that a kid might dream of, and seemed like a elaborate old comic book. Just cool. Take a look at this film, it may be a far fetched plot like flash gordon of that era, but take it in the text of fantasyt of a comic book, like superman, batman, the hulk etc, and I think you might enjoy it.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>THX1138 is the apartment numbers seen on a glass window of a door in the film, notice the Star Wars connection there, remember the awful Aliens Vs Predator, and realize that fanboy motion picture films are really not what we want to see... ever. With that said and done the art value of Sky Captain is quite high, although certainly not the near perfect CGI as we have seen many years ago in a similar teenage movie "Final Fantasy", which did it better, but the story was not really there either, whereas Sky Captain has live action actors in with the CGI, doesn't really end up doing that much for it in the end considering that the best thing in this offering is the sexy/funny/action heroine character that Angelina Jolie plays for the ten minutes she is in it and not the dumb blond character of Gwyneth Paltrow actually playing a dumb blond and obviously hating every second of it because Jude Law gets to blame absolutely everything on her (he should have loved it a little more maybe), Episode 1 has certainly much better background composite effects work, plus animations, Sky Captain never breaking the airplane special effects that Pearl Harbor had, EP1 though had an even better story, so that will tell you what kind of audience this End of Summer 2004 Sci-fi was catering for.<br /><br />By all the means, this is a great movie for young kids because there is no elements of strong violence, except for very light comedy violence towards the end and is devoid of bad language meaning anyone can watch it, and so for that reason should be not be trashed for being at least a glamorous looking Saturday Cinema morning candy stall sell-out that is probably actually worth their dollars this time but if you are older then maybe consider watching all the originals that this one tries to pay homage too first (everything from Jurassic Park to The Day the Earth Stood Still). I maybe still get a better kick out of watching black and white Flash Gordon episodes to give this anything more than a solid three stars. Fun if you like Flash though, but I think this one could have been better.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>With a terribly thin plot, and wooden performances from its accomplished ensemble cast, Sky Captain and The World of Tomorrow still delivers in a kind of invigorating, stimulating and cornball way. The highlight of the movie is obviously the astounding visual effects, all add later by digital computer. The story, characters, and everything else are merely vehicles for the special effects. The movie has a sheer audacity and boldness of vision, but the admiration quickly evaporates after 15 minutes when one thinks of the film's numerous plot holes, the terrible writing, and the actors that are generally stiff and non-inspiring.<br /><br />The generic plot plunders every classic film from The Wizard of Oz to Star Wars and Indiana Jones. The story centers on the mystery of a group of disappearing scientists in the 1930's. Perky reporter Polly Perkins (spunkily played by Gwyneth Paltrow) tries to find out what happened to them. After meeting one of the scientists, she's trapped on the streets of Manhattan when futuristic, giant robots begin to storm the city in search of power filled generators. Joe 'Sky Captain' Sullivan (Jude Law) is called to save the day. Joe and Polly have a history together and three years ago had a falling out, but they manage to put their animosity aside in order to search for the scientists and figure out where the robots are coming from. Along the way the meet a leather-clad, eye patched British naval captain (appallingly played by Angelina Jolie), who commands a fleet of aircraft carrier-like flying vehicles with the Union Jack plastered on the front.<br /><br />Viewers who like movies with lots of action and visual affects are going to enjoy this film. Although this viewer found that the cinematography had a fake, grainy, soft quality that was a little too dark, too often. The film also had a weird, out of focus, washed out feel to it, that made Gwyneth, Jude and Angelina look good, but at times, made it difficult to see the effects sequences taking place around them.  If nothing else, the film will probably succeed in fooling the viewer - never once did this viewer feel that this "world of tomorrow" was just CGI and that the actors were really working against a blue screen.

Unwinding that, it's a story about a future that was imagined in the 1930s of 1940s, in the black and white Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers films. The visual style is reasonably true to that era, down to the black and white look. That was the look that's been retroactively colorized since the 1980s, sometimes badly, and that paint-by-numbers color style is used here.<br /><br />The style works, and I expect to see a lot of imitations, even though this is already an imitation of the colorizers' imitation of real color movies. The palette included only a warm brown, for skin tones, and a blue, for sky, buildings, and most everything else. The reddish lipstick on Polly, the female lead, may have been the only exception to that two-dimensional color scheme.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the acting was pretty two-dimensional as well. For example, once Polly's character was set, she'd wear those spike heels everywhere, even through forests and rubble-strewn disaster sites. Frankie (Angelina Jolie) put words to my thoughts upon seeing Polly for the first time: "What's THAT?"<br /><br />Well, I just came for the adventure and for the incredible visual style. The adventure was passable, and the style has the advantage of novelty. It's a popcorn movie, modern and retro at the same time. If that's all you expect, you may like it.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A3CN9CCJUNIPKT.html">A3CN9CCJUNIPKT</a><br/><p>I had read a bunch of online reviews that said this was a movie that was all "look" and little substance.  It's true.  The gauzy, sepia-toned computo-cinematography is equal parts Fritz Lang's Metropolis and cheesy sci-fi serialization.  It's thrilling to look at for the first few minutes, but once the torpor of the film becomes apparent, nothing really makes much of an impression.  It seems as if the stars -- Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow -- were instructed to behave as if they were actors in a low-budget '30s action serial, ie., to emote flatly and have delayed or muted reactions to any and all plot developments.  This, combined with the actual challenge of acting against a blue screen (where the actor is told what special effects will be doing, but can't actually see what will be onscreen in final print...), essentially sinks the film.  Overall, the movie is just plain unexciting -- the pacing is slow, the special effects are also held in check, presumably to mimic the stiff, ricketty charm of the serials.  Thus, robots clank past clumsily, stone walls fall to the ground as if made of molasses, airplanes move with mechanical deliberation... Why the director didn't just digitize in some fake "wires" to hold the models up is, honestly, a bit of a mystery to me.  The film is full of clever homages to classic films -- The Wizard Of Oz, Lost Horizon, every "girl reporter" film known to mankind, etc. -- but although it's clearly a labor of love on the part of director Kerry Conran, Sky Captain is essentially dull as dishwater.  It's a pity.  If they had injected just a modicum of excitment into the proceedings, this could have been a wonderful film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>Based on the hype, I was expecting something bigger than the Indiana Jones movies.  What this film lacked, was a character as dynamic as Indiana Jones and a plausible storyline.  Also, it appeared that this movie was filmed in black and white and then colorized (to give it an old movie feel).  I think it might have been better if they just stuck to black and white (I hate the look of colorized movies).<br /><br />There were a lot of good special effects, such as when Gwyenneth Paltrow is manuvering through skyscrapper sized mechanical men and some comic relief that you had to be quick to catch (there is an image of Godzilla attacking Tokyo).  Angelina Jolie is the highlight of the movie, giving a fine performance as a very proper British commander of an armada of flying aircraft carriers (if that makes sense).  I think a sequel with her character as the star would work a lot better.</p></br><a href="../users/A16GAIJJE39T1S.html">A16GAIJJE39T1S</a><br/><p>I don't know what the director had in mind for this movie, but for me this film is a sort of inspired comedy.  Carl Sagan once observed that modern science fiction movies are actually adventure movies that lack any tangible reference to science.  This is certainly the case here--but made all the more obvious by the fact that this world is made to seem to rely on twentieth century technology.  The effect of a flying aircraft carrier appearing out of nowhere to refuel the hero's single engine P-40 like fighter (a model of military industrial complex inefficiency and over budget thinking) was shocking to behold!  The explicit impossibility of this world seemed to exalt in technical absurdities rather than attempt to paper them over.  For my son and I (both of us engineers)--the surprising appearance of each incredible scene evoked uproarious laughter!<br /><br />I should also say that I loved the Art Deco look of everything from malevolent robots and rocket ships to newsrooms and skyscrapers.  It reminds me of the Forbidden Planet era conception of streamlined spacecraft that I enjoyed as a small child at the dawn of the space age.  How disappointing clunky are real space vehicles when compared to the clean lines of one of the shapely rocket arc seen in the final scenes of this movie--a veritable finned Cadillac of the heavens!</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>"Sky Captain" does more than tip its hat to German expressionist film and to the old serials; it is filmed as if a 1930s vintage Flash Gordon serial were a newsreel rather than fantasy.  The art direction is astounding, and shows off a huge amount of technical mastery and creativity.  Jude Law is perfect as Sky Captain, and Gwyneth Paltrow pulls off the Polly Perkins role as well, which I hadn't expected given her background as a "serious" actress.  Giovanni Ribisi steals the show as Dex.<br /><br />So why just three stars?  Despite all the action, the great art and the quality of the performances, "Sky Captain" is generally listless and uninvolving.  "Indiana Jones" attempted something similar with a different kind of serial, and succeeded in part because of the sense of fun of the movie overall.  That sense of fun is generally missing from "Sky Captain."<br /><br />This is well worth viewing once, and you will probably enjoy it, but you might not be inclined to add this to your permanent collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C80B497LCYKA.html">A1C80B497LCYKA</a><br/><p>I love the special features on this DVD. It tells the story of a young filmmaker named Kerry Conran who wanted to make a film based on some of the old comic-style pulp fiction that kids grew up with in the 1930's and early 40's. Someone gave me some of those books when I was a kid, and they looked just like Conran's art. Francis Ford Coppola is quoted as having said that one day, the next Mozart would come along and produce a film on his computer in Ohio, or something to that effect. Well, the day has arrived. Conran literally started this film on his computer, with composite photos and artwork done by his brother. They kept writing and piecing together a rough reel to take around to the different studios. The story of their odyssey is amazing, but they finally found people that were interested in helping them; which shows that, if you believe in something that is good and persevere - you'll eventually get there.<br /><br />Almost everything in the film is CGI - which means it was created on a computer - and has a soft, charcoal drawing effect reminiscent of the old 1930's pulp fiction. The few things that are real include the actors, of course: Jude Law as Sky Captain, the fellow everyone calls on when freedom and safety are threatened; Gwyneth Paltrow as Polly Perkins, the reporter who's in love with him; and Angelina Jolie as Frankie, an old flame and commander of a British "sky station." While the acting is acceptable, you can't expect great performances when everything is blue- and green-screen, and the actors are having to imagine everything in their heads. As wonderful as the film looks, this is no way to make a film.<br /><br />Which brings us to story: it's thin, predictable, and not cliffhanging like the stories it is trying to imitate. I know some think that's the way pulp novels from back then were: maybe so; but that's no excuse - if you're going to make a film for today's audience, you need solid plot and strong dialog, and "style" is no excuse for sacrificing both. There are other films based on popular material from the same period (the Indiana Jones series being the most notable), and they don't sacrifice these elements; so why should Sky Captain?<br /><br />Granted the "look" is fun. There was a lot of naivet&eacute; in the 30's about the technical advances of the future, which the Buck Rogers novels and comic books reveal. The "streamlined" look of planes, trains and automobiles from this period is fascinating, including the industrial design work of Bel Geddes and others. I loved seeing all of that come to life. But this is a movie, not just a walk down memory lane, and we were there to see good drama as well as exciting visuals, and the drama just wasn't there.<br /><br />I think Kerry Conran and his associates had a lot of guts, and I'm glad they made their foray into filmmaking. They proved what could be done in the area of special effects by someone with a computer and a lot of imagination, vision and drive. But they also proved what shouldn't be done: an entire movie built around a look rather than a story. If you don't agree with me on this, go back and watch it again, now that the novelty of the artwork has worn off, and see if it holds your attention the way Twelve O'clock High or other well-written scripts from that period do. The story has to be there.<br /><br />Also, it's not just the script: after a while, the artwork itself gets old. You get tired of looking at too much stylized art, and eventually long for reality. Cinema is a wonderful medium for stylization; but it is primarily a realistic medium, and we want to see that. In cinema, you've got to have at least one foot in reality so that people can believe in and enter your world. Because Sky Captain had most toes dangling in the world of stylized fantasy, with a very thin script to boot, it was really hard to enter that world.<br /><br />At any rate: good effort Kerry Conran and company. I look forward to your next foray. I hope we don't have to wait too long.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>I don't expect too much from a retro-sci fi movie that is being hailed mostly for the visual effects, and I like a cinematic movie as much as the next person, but I can only take so many plot holes you can drive a truck through. The world is under attack and there is only one plane to fight them, even though he returns to a base full of them (which again remain on the ground when the base comes under attack, come on, Pearl Harbor was bad, but at least there was more than one plane in the air). In New York, the Sky Captain does a vertical loop to escape his pursuers and then flies down an alley with... a dead end? (I'm reminded of Spock in Star Trek II '[the enemy] does appear to be exhibiting a two dimensional manner of thinking') Polly rides along with Sky Captain through zany twists and turns in New York, confidently giving him directions, then wigs out as he starts a dive. The robots are everywhere (in one room of the mad scientists lair), except when they are conveniently not (in the room next door, they can knock over New York, but not a locked door). Despite a raging battle outside the lair as the hero's fight their way in, once inside they find no one has been alerted to their possible presence. In short, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is nothing special, but good friday night fun.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS1HA5M3EPZ4.html">ATS1HA5M3EPZ4</a><br/><p>Sky captain is an exercise in specific throwback story telling that most people can recognize right from the first frame.  There is no mistaking the film-noir/action-adventure/sci-fi genres that this movie so firmly holds in its roots.  However, stylish visuals and computer animation alone cannot hold a movie up.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong; Sky Captain is a decent movie, with great action and a sense of humor and fun.  It throws in many elements of old films and comes up with an interesting amalgamation of creative production value.  The story starts off somewhat normal; scientists are being abducted and Polly Perkins (Gwenith Paltrow), a brash and fearless reporter, is hot on the story.  As large robots attack New York City, the Sky Captain (Jude Law) is called in to defend the city.  Flying what looks like a Corsair fighter plane, he successfully runs off the robots but not before they have unearthed generators in the city.  As the story goes on, more pieces of the puzzle are put in place and the dangers become bigger and more menacing.  They discover that they must stop a mad scientist bent on a `New World of Tomorrow' domination scheme.<br /><br />The technology and sci-fi aspect get so wild there is a large amount of faith put in suspension of disbelief.  I personally thought the 40s era approach and perspective on some of the technology was fascinating.  They found such simple ways to do complicated things.  But if you have no love for that kind of far fetched technology (planes that can go underwater, flying mobile airstrips) then you may hate it quickly.<br /><br />The direction of the actors leaves a lot to be desired.  Despite the heavy hitters, Paltrow, Law and even Giovanni Rabisi, they obviously had a hard time trying to act in front of green screens (their parts were filmed against green screens first to have everything added later in the background with computer animation).  They do well in some parts but others they just seemed lost.  Overall they do well, considering what they are up against.<br /><br />The movie is still a sight to behold and surely others will follow the example.  Director Kerry Conran is living his own dream and does a fantastic job of pulling out one fantastic fantasy visual after another.  He obviously has a soft spot for the Wizard of Oz as well, which becomes very apparent, as the heroes get closer to the finale.</p></br><a href="../users/AW99SBGWEXP0J.html">AW99SBGWEXP0J</a><br/><p>When giant robots invade Manhattan, Joe "Sky Captain" Sullivan (Law) is called in to save the day.  After stopping those robots, he is reunited with Polly Perkins (Paltrow), an old love and reporter.  Apparently, the robot attack is tied to the disappearance of prominent scientists.  Some research by Polly points to the mysterious Dr. Totenkoph (Laurence Olivier, in a computer-aided performance - he has been dead for a while now).  Sky Captain embarks on a quest to find Totenkoph, and Polly will not be left behind.<br /><br />To some extent "Sky Captain" is an exercise in style over substance.  That's not to say that there is no story, it is just that the story serves to give the audience all those glorious visuals.  The effects are amazing, and provide the movie with a look that I have never seen before.  "Sky Captain" plays like a movie from the early twentieth century made with the effects technology of today.  It is an original idea, and it is flawlessly executed.  The effects are so great to look at that you do not realize the story is not the greatest.  Perhaps it just seems a bit hokey in today's movie age...I am not a huge fan of old movies.<br /><br />Law and Paltrow do good jobs in the lead roles.  Angeline Jolie makes an appearance later in the film, but is by no means one of the leads.  The most memorable role is Dex Dearborn, Sky Captain's sidekick played with a bit of quirkiness by Giovanni Ribisi.  "Sky Captain" is a good "escape" movie, worth checking out, especially on the big screen.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FFYQZPUGOX58.html">A2FFYQZPUGOX58</a><br/><p>The first machines appeared about three years ago.  They were huge frightening things; the only reason you haven't heard of them is because they had restricted their looting to remote regions; that is, until Friday, when the whole world learned of their existence, beginning with New York when squadrons of giant robots flew overhead, landed in the streets, crushing cars as they marched, and tearing up the pavement searching for underground goodies.  The police's firepower was no match for their armored skin; it was time to call in the Sky Captain to save the day. . . .<br /><br />Overall feeling: disappointment.  The designs of the various robots and flying machines are interesting, but the disjointed script and inattention to continuity ruined it.  For example:<br /><br />At the beginning of the movie, a scientist, aboard the Hindenburg III, mysteriously disappears just as the zeppelin ties up to the Empire State Building;  the newspaper covering the story is dated 7 October 1939.<br /><br />Later, when six-story-high mechanical cyclopes, each emblazoned with an emblem of a winged-skull, dig up and steal New York's generators, the newspaper covering this story is dated 17 March 1939.<br /><br />And still later, when Joe and Polly are flying over the Pacific, Joe needs the date so he can look up the location of a star he is using for navigation; Polly tells him the date is 2 March (1939).<br /><br />Apparently, in this alternate universe, time runs backwards. . . .<br /><br />Picture (Blu-ray): 2.5 to 3.  While there are some scenes or parts of a scene that are sharp enough to show significant detail, most scenes are blurry, fuzzy, and nearly colorless with a brown sepia tint; it looks like an old black-and-white movie that has been poorly colorized.  Measured Aspect Ratio as: 1.78:1.  Languages & Subtitles: English, French, and Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/AB0GGIQBNB36Q.html">AB0GGIQBNB36Q</a><br/><p>Having recently gone back and watched this movie, I can honestly say. This movie deserves more than five stars, I was reminded of the serials of the 30's and 40's. Like "Spy Smasher" and "The Phantom". Some people say Jude Law was overacting, well in a moving like this. Which is an obvious homage to those serials, guess what. Overacting is expected, this movie is pure popcorn fun, I won't go into the plot since that's already been done a thousand times. I was surprised to see the Titanic make an appearance in this movie, again I liked it. I wish they would make a sequel, and just like Spy Smasher. Sky Captain saves us from the evil Doctor, Or was the evil doctor behind it all. You'll have to get the movie to find out, I can assure you. You won't be disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A25CMSI6S7S63C.html">A25CMSI6S7S63C</a><br/><p>I hadn't watched this in years & well I have to admit, this movie is right up my alley, I very much enjoyed it for many reasons. I love the visualization, the scenery, the atmosphere, the fact that it is a movie based on the Golden Era of movies, as if it was shot in the 1930s, it was like an action adventure film noir meets Jurassic park and the Iron Giant. I loved the giant robots & the dino creatures in this. The story has Jude Law as Sky Captain along with Gwyneth Paltow and Angelia Jolie trying to save the world from a mad scientist. Ok its a little deeper than that, but for me it was the action,all the great scenery of where this chase goes from the city to ice to underwater to the jungle. It was also like an Indiana Jones movie too. It had everything needed to entertain, had a lot of action, acting was fine but these movies are made for non stop thrills and this delivered. I do have a passion for giant monsters,robots and great atmospheric scenery,so if you are the same, I highly recommend this movie. It is a lot of fun and a good mix of genres.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>I had only two gripes with the film. One was the quirky pacing of the film, and the somewhat thin performance of Angelina Jolie. But that's about it. I did love the visuals in the film. It's filled with dazzling special effects, lovely music, and gorgeous scenery. The late 30's comic and pulp atmosphere is mixed with modern (50's, 60's and today) sci-fi technologies. I think that's what makes it so appealing: this is an excellent mixture of old and new. Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow are both great in this film; the supporting cast is also very good. But the best things about this film are the visual effects, the cinematography, and the stylish art direction. Watch it for the visuals.<br /><br />Grade: A-</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />After a spectacular opening, Sky Captain devolves into a disappointingly routine movie that is still (barely) worth recommending due to its intriguing visuals and nostalgic feel.</p></br><a href="../users/AESY8NCX6VS6O.html">AESY8NCX6VS6O</a><br/><p>Within the first fifteen minutes of Sky Captain, I was in. Gigantic robots swarm New York City and stomp through the streets, Gwenyth Paltrow as Polly Perkins does a pitch-perfect emulation of those 1930's newspaper gals, and the whole movie has the feel of the best old sci-fi movie never made. I felt like a five-year-old again; not in that still-eating-paste sense, but because something on the screen was so boldly exciting I nearly leapt out of my seat and applauded. No freaking joke. Needless to say, the rest of Sky Captain never really reaches the level of invigoration that its slam-bang opener achieves (and yeah, it has a few slow moments), but it's still an accomplished, consistently interesting movie with enough in-jokes to keep film buffs satisfied (look for not only references to The Wizard of Oz, but a few Citizen Kane nods as well) and enough rip-roaring action for everyone else.<br /><br />  Sky Captain could have been an empty exercise just for the sake of a new filmmaking technique - I'm sure you know by now it was all done in front of a blue screen. What makes it so interesting, though, is how seriously everyone takes the whole endeavor. Jude Law effortlessly embodies the sarcastic, multi-talented everyman do-gooder; Gwenyth Paltrow delivers those one-liners in a way that Howard Hawks would be proud; Giovanni Ribisi steals his scenes like any faithful sidekick should; and the whole plot of the movie (which could have been a borderline parody) comes off as deadly serious. Don't let the blue-screen hesitation hold you back from this one; if you complain that they don't make 'em like they used to, here's proof that it's not always the case. B+</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" represents the triumph of style over substance, the P-40 Tomahawk over mechanical monsters, and computer generated actors over death itself.  That last part is actually the tip of an ethical iceberg that has the potential of being the biggest point of contention in Hollywood since Ted Turner broke out his box of crayons and started colorizing black & white classic films.  But for now we can just enjoy director-writer Kerry Conran's tribute to both the decade and the serials of the 1930s done with enough digital magic to make going over the rainbow seem like an unnecessary journey.<br /><br />The story begins in a New York City untouched by either the Great Depression or the madness of Hitler's Nazis.  But there is still a Teutonic threat beginning to encroach on the civilized world courtesy of the brilliant, mysterious, and apparently evil Dr. Totenkopf (enjoy the surprise).  Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow), an intrepid reporter for "The Chronicle," stumbles upon the first significant clue about the good doctor only to be distracted by the legion of giant killer mechanical men walking down the streets of New York City.  In defense of the city comes Joe Sullivan (Jude Law), the Sky Captain himself, whose P-40 Tomahawk with its Flying Tiger teeth has been souped up by his sidekick, Dex Dearborn (Giovanni Ribisi).  Of course Polly and Joe had something in the past, so there is a lot of subtext to her backseat driving as they go merrily along.<br /><br />In the grand tradition of the Saturday morning serial the hero and his gal get on the trail of the bad machines, fueled by Dex being kidnapped by a mysterious Asian woman (Bai Ling) and helped by a few old friends, most notably Franky Cook (Angelina Jolie), the commander of a most unusual British airship.  The running gag for the second half of the film is that Polly has only two shots left in her camera and keeps bypassing visual wonders, such as the real Shangri-La, because there could be something better around the corner.<br /><br />Visually, "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" is a visual treat, filled in the same sort of sepia tones we associate with the first reel of "The Wizard of Oz," a film that is clearly a reference point for Conran.  Much is made of the fact that the actors performed in front of a blue screen to which Conrad added all the dazzling images of the mechanical creations in the art deco style of a lot of the architecture we see in the film, all glowing with a blue light.  But Law, Paltrow, Jolie and the rest of the cast get credit for playing these roles straight without ever getting too tongue in cheek.  This is an earnest homage and not parody, and while the result might not be great cinema it is still as much fun as any of the Saturday morning serials it wants to emulate.<br /><br />This film wants to be "Raiders of the Lost Ark" for a new generation of filmgoers weaned on computer generated images, but it is not up to that level.  The difference can be simply quantified by saying Kerry Conran is not Steven Spielberg, but it would be more worthwhile to point out that in his first film Conran has a much better handle on the cinematic over the dramatic aspects of movie making.  His next project is the long awaited adaptation of Edgar Rice Burrough's "A Princess of Mars," with a screenplay by Mark Protosevich ("The Cell"), which should help firm up the dramatic half of the equation.  Given the stunning eye candy provided in his debut effort, whatever Conran does in the future will certainly be worth a look.</p></br><a href="../users/ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV.html">ACIBQ6BQ6AWEV</a><br/><p>Computer generated special effects have been around for quite some time now, and often questionably so, but they come into their own with Kerry Conran's SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW--an innovative film that failed in theatrical release but which now makes a big splash in the home market.  And whether you love it or hate it, SKY CAPTAIN is likely to cast a very long shadow indeed.<br /><br />As a concept, the film seems to be based on the popular serials of the 1930s and 1940s.  This is not limited to the use of an improbable plot fueled by special effects and cliffhanger action sequences, but it extends to the dialogue and characters as well, all of which are typical of such celebrated serials as BUCK ROGERS, CAPTAIN MARVEL, SPY SMASHER, and THE CRIMSON GHOST. The film also draws specific plot elements from such diverse sources as KING KONG, LOST HORIZON, THE WIZARD OF OZ, and WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE, to name but a few.<br /><br />The story is typical of serials.  "Girl Reporter" Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) is doing a story on missing scientists--and when giant metal robots attack New York she unexpectedly holds a clue to their origin.  She and Sky Captain (Jude Law) form an uneasy alliance to get to the bottom of things. With an assist from Sky Captain's faithful sidekick Dex (Giovanni Ribisi) and the disconcertingly military Frankie (Angelina Jolie), the two search the world--and finally track the wicked Dr. Totenkopf (Laurence Olivier, resurrected via CGI) to his secret lair.<br /><br />The look of the film follows suit.  The live cast worked on a blue screen set, and with the exception of a single set, the costumes, and items the live actors had to handle, everything you see on the screen was created in the computer and added after the fact.  A great many people have described the look of the film as "deco," an arts movement associated with the 1920s; this is misleading.  It would be more accurate to describe it as a mixture of pre-WWII arts movements filtered through a 1950s sensibility, and the result is like nothing so much as a pulp science fiction magazine cover unexpectedly come to life.<br /><br />Now, how much you like this will depend to a great extent on how clearly you recognize the film styles and specific films that have clearly influenced it.  If you know nothing about serials, for example, you are likely to be appalled by the flatness of the script and Paltrow's one-note performance; on the other hand, if you are a serial fan, you'll immediately recognize that the script is reflective of such serials as SPY SMASHER and that Paltrow echoes Linda Sterling, famous for such serials as THE CRIMSON GHOST.  It wouldn't be too much to say that in many respects SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW is akin to an inside joke.<br /><br />But most particularly, your liking for this film will depend on how you react to the visuals.  I am not a great fan of CGI when it is used to bolster live action films such as GLADIATOR or TITANIC; I can usually spot the CGI and I find it distracting.  But I have to come down in favor of SKY CAPTAIN: this isn't an effort to "make it look real;" this is an effort to make a totally artificial world, and whether it be giant robots, Shangri-La, or Radio City Music Hall the designs are stunning and remarkably well executed.  Whatever other shortcomings it may have, SKY CAPTAIN has incredible visual "WOW!"<br /><br />The DVD release is visually handsome with superior sound, and the package contains a fair number of bonuses.  Unfortunately, the two commentary tracks are less interesting than you might expect, but two short documentaries ("Brave New World" and "The Art of the World of Tomorrow") are quite good--and the original six minute short that inspired the film is fascinating.  Not every one will get it, so I recommend you rent before you buy, but on the whole this is a show truly worth the money.  Recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>Back in 1996, wannabe filmmaker Kerry Conran was holed up in his small Sherman Oaks apartment hunched over his Apple computer incessantly rendering segments and scenes for a trailer of an epic movie that only existed in his head.  Two years later he had an art deco tinged, vintage-looking six minute black and white teaser that would become SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW (Paramount).<br /><br />A screenplay was begun after producer John Avnet saw that short film in 1998 and committed to making Kevin's big screen vision a reality.  Two years later, shooting began in London with Kevin directing. Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie acted out every digitally storyboarded scene on a bare, blue stage.  All the globe trotting locations and huge aerial and underwater action set pieces were then computer designed with the actors seamlessly inserted.<br /><br />I mention these things because the art of this film is at least as important as the story. Set in the late 1930s, giant robots invade New York City and perky reporter Paltrow alerts old lover Joe "Sky Captain" Sullivan (Jude Law).  Their daunting task is to figure out who's behind this attack and stop a conspiracy to destroy civilization in order to save the planet.  An idea that resonates on some level today.<br /><br />The exquisitely beautiful, period perfect, richly detailed results didn't connect to the full audience potential this breathtaking breakthrough film deserves.<br /><br />Extras include three informative featurettes on the art and making of this film and there are two superb commentaries.  One from the filmmakers and a lone producer commentary from Avnet that should be the model for all future producer commentaries.<br /><br />This DVD is highly recommended.<br /><br />Maybe there will be a two disc extended edition that includes the finished version of the important deleted scenes and a separate disc that actualy shows the digital artists at work creating the astonishingly detailed, beautifully executed visuals that look straight out of the 30s.</p></br><a href="../users/A1655SGPPUUCRP.html">A1655SGPPUUCRP</a><br/><p>"Sky Captain And the World of Tomorrow" is a wonderfully entertaining and refreshingly unique action flick that stands head and shoulders over any other recent films of the genre.  I was stunned by the lush visuals, gorgeous lighting, period costumes, rich colors and overall style of the film.  Whoever said style over substance was a bad thing?<br /><br />"Sky Captain" is riddled with references to films of the 30's and 40's and old adventure comic books.  This nostalgia is what gives "Sky Captain" its own unique persona that has so amazed critics and audiences worldwide.  In the troubled world we live in today, many yearn for simpler times, and the best way to revisit the past is, of course, through film.  In "Sky Captain", I fond comfort in the simplistic beauty of times past.<br /><br />From the opening moments, as snow falls on a Gotham-like a scene, Director Kerry Conran sets the mood and style as he docks the massive airship Hindenburg III to the top of the Empire State Building in a sequence so astounding and breathtakingly real; so of the moment, that it fills audiences with an awe and wonder.  Conran takes a palpable joy in his filmmaking, an enthusiasm that sweeps you off your feet.  The visuals in "Sky Captain" are, simply put, are among the most astounding I have ever seen in a film.  No wonder Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and Giovanni Ribisi were all scrambling to be a part of this soon-to-be classic film!<br /><br />The story is by no means bad, as it has been suggested by many, but rather it is much more basic than most action flicks nowadays.  Frankly, I loved the simplicity of the story, which once again reminded me of Old Hollywood.  There were no annoying, pointless subplots that so confused me that I found myself frustrated with the film as I left the theater.  The fun, witty script kept me entertained and I found that I had a large, goofy grin on my face practically the entire film.  The whole thing was just so darn fun and lovable that I couldn't help it!  By far the year's best film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EOYN87MMNHL1.html">A3EOYN87MMNHL1</a><br/><p>Why had I not ever heard of this movie?  It is outstanding--especially if you are a connoisseur of special effects.  I was kept enthralled and in a dreamlike state while viewing the tableau of retro-futuristic eye candy.  Paltrow and Jolie are stunningly beautiful, as always, and Jude Law is handsome, daring and fearless in thwarting the diabolical designs of the villian and his killing machines.  I fell victim to an addictive contagion of wanting more, more, more of these stunning escapades and special effects.  So very Flash Gordon-y.  You must see!</p></br><a href="../users/A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1.html">A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1</a><br/><p>Cornball plot but cool movie nonetheless. Although Gwyneth Paltrow, as Polly Perkins acts and talks like she's spaced-out (i.e. reading from a script) like she tends to do in a lot of her movies. Jude Law's (Sky Captain) voice somehow always seems to grate on me.<br /><br />The digital special effects seem to take one back to another time in film-making (yeah, I know). Though the acting was rather stiff; especially from Angelina Jolie, it was a fun adventure film. Funny also with Gwyneth Paltrow and her camera; deciding whether or not to take a shot, knowing full well she's almost out of film.<br /><br />The "robot monsters" were pretty cool. But it was kind of stupid that Sky Captain was flying a "prop job" (P-40) with some "futuristic hardware" that didn't go with the airplane.<br /><br />Giovanni Ribisi plays Dex, the chewing gum chomping stereotype of a mechanical wiz that's a throwback from the "old movies" - yeah, I know, that's the way it was meant to be. But he over-acted to the point of being very annoying.</p></br><a href="../users/A3SFO2GSP5CVSM.html">A3SFO2GSP5CVSM</a><br/><p>Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow is perhaps the first film whose computer special effects wizardry was trotted out as a reason to see it that I can honestly say is a good film, a very good film. Are there films that bowl one over more impressively? Yes. But this film is virtually all special effects, and was filmed on a blue screen soundstage. The texture of the film, the lighting, and the iconographic imagery, as well as stylistic techniques, all evoke the feel of 1930s-1950s era science fiction films, especially the serial films of that period.<br />  First time director Kerry Conran does a marvelous job of recreating the feel of when the world was still large and dark and fearsome, in this late 2004 film, even more so than Peter Jackson did in last year's late sci fi entry King Kong. Where that film was a remake of a classic sci fi film from that era, this film is an homage, and it succeeds all the more for it. Perhaps the only thing that could have made it more rollicking was the use of chapter breaks, which the DVD commentaries say was tried, but ultimately cut out of the final cut of the film, which is only 95 minutes long, and moves briskly. The plot is threadbare, but that's perfect for this action oriented sci fi serial homage. The pre-World war Two world is being decimated by giant flying robots who steal all manner of industrial equipment. New York is laid waste, and reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) has a lead as to who may be behind it all.<br />Yet, as referential as it is, the film establishes its own identity, with repartee between Polly and Joe hinting at a romantic past that went kaput, and their banter about her only having two photograph shots left, add quite a bit to characterization, in an offhanded way. Paltrow evokes the sort of heroine a Faith Domergue played in many such films. There are also many small touches that enhance scenes and characters, such as when Polly and Joe land on the Totenkopf's island, she notices that the reflection of his plane's serial number h110d spells Polly, in the reflected water, or the excellent use of scenes from The Wizard Of Oz in Radio City Music Hall, as Polly questions a scared scientist. Almost every scene has such details that subliminally enhance the overall work. Compared to Steven Spielberg's lame Indiana Jones serial homage film series from twenty years ago, Sky Captain And The World Of Tomorrow shows how to do it right, using special effects as an integral part of the tale, not just for a wow factor. It will be interesting to see, if after a decade making this film, Conran is only a one hit wonder, or a true young stud of cinema. He's already shown he has a better visual style than Spielberg, and certainly a better understanding for character and plot, for he knows that such beautiful fluff plays best when played straight.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K0UT3GA4QQG5.html">A1K0UT3GA4QQG5</a><br/><p>If you can be a kid for a couple hours, you will enjoy this movie. Otherwise it may look Dull. Take a chance, it is better the 2nd time!</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>This 2004 film reflects amazing visual invention, and first-time writer/director Kerry Conran, self-professed computer geek, has fashioned something remarkably singular from his fertile imagination, his obviously encyclopedic knowledge of pre-WWII popular culture, and most of all, his technological savvy. What he has created is impressive - a self-contained world of startling images that seem simultaneously futuristic and retro in a colorized black-and-white world bathed in diffuse lighting and stylized art deco designs. Moving like a speeding train, the plot is stuffed with so many references to other classic stories and movies it often gets overwhelming, and I have to admit some of the turns get very convoluted as a result. As a pop culture junkie myself, I see tributes to George Pal's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AOEMWS">The War of the Worlds</a>, Ray Harryhausen's special effects in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767810864">Jason and the Argonauts</a>, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SAGGL4">The Lost World</a>, James Hilton's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00093099U">Lost Horizon</a>, Aldous Huxley's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060850523">Brave New World</a>, Steven Spielberg's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXC5">Indiana Jones</a> trilogy and "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", George Lucas' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FQJAIW">Star Wars</a> especially in the aerial chase scenes, and the stiff upper lip of British WWII films.<br /><br />That's a lot of references for a 103-minute film, sometimes too much, but Conran does a mostly smart job of spinning his plates into a truly exciting film. Beyond that, it amazes me that most of the action was done against a green screen, as the people and images seamlessly meld together. There are incredible sequences involving gigantic robots trampling New York, fanciful aerial air strips with dozens of fighter planes, swarms of automated winged weapons among others, and they are sequenced at a lightning-fast pace. The actors are well cast, though the best compliment one can pay them is that they don't get in the way of the action. In fact, their relative nonchalance to the extraordinary things going on around them is a major part of the fun. Jude Law cuts a dashing figure as the nominal hero, although he seems too lightweight and frankly a bit too earnest to be truly memorable. Gwyneth Paltrow plays the obligatory Lois Lane part, aptly named Polly Perkins, with a saucy mix of Veronica Lake's peek-a-boo allure (I love the skirt slitting shot) and Barbara Stanwyck's tough-dame savvy.<br /><br />In an all-too-brief part late in the film, Angelina Jolie is wonderfully gutsy as a veddy British naval captain, finally able to use her striking looks (not to mention her arresting eyepatch) to great effect. Not every actress can get away with a line like "Alert the amphibious squad!". In smaller roles, Giovanni Ribisi as the bubblegum-chewing Dex and British comedian Omid Djalili as Vienna sausage-loving Kaji seem to function purely as plot devices to move the story along. Conran understandably uses characters as chess pieces because the visual elements are what make this story percolate. I only wish Conran could have simplified the story a bit to let us absorb more of what's going on. I felt a little out of breath every time the locale changed since I wasn't sure I grasped everything I needed to know up to that point. I also think it's a bit of a conceit to "cast" the late Laurence Olivier as the primary villain since it feeds into one of the final plot twists.<br /><br />The 2005 Special Collector's Edition DVD boasts some significant extras starting with two separate commentary tracks - the first from producer Jon Avnet and the second from Conran and the special effects crew. I found there was not enough distinction between the two tracks, but both discuss the complexity of the production in thorough detail. There is a behind-the-scenes documentary, "Brave New World", which runs nearly an hour and shows the startling green screen process. The film was shot on just one soundstage even though the story travels around the world. Two shorts are also included - one focused on the costumes and production design by the director's brother Kevin and the other the six-minute demo made to give studio executives a preview of the final film. Deleted/extended scenes and a gag reel round out the extras.</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>Even on DVD, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow has serious image problems, although the fact that the movie is deliberately stylised makes it a little less of a problem. Unfortunately, the two-tone, almost sepia color and the excessive diffusion of the image tends to bleed the film of vitality at times and does no favors whatsoever to Gwyneth Paltrow, who looks absolutely terrible throughout the film (the fact that her performance is not just bad but plain unlikeable much of the time doesn't help: small wonder that Angeline Jolie steals the film from her). Kerry Conran does manage to recreate some of the visual style of the old Max and Dave Fleischer Superman cartoons (Mechanical Monsters in particular), but without their vivid three-strip Technicolor, and he gives good montage. Unfortunately, he's better at visual design than directing actors or action - this should be a lot more fun than it actually is. Jude Law is a particularly weak hero, lacking steel or much in the way of charisma, once again proving that he's a better character actor in supporting roles than a credible leading man. It's watchable enough and the big undersea dogfight shows how much better it could have been, but never draws you in and carries you along enough to be as much fun as it wants to be. And if you're going to use footage of Laurence Olivier to `play' the villain, at least find a voice double who actually sounds like him!</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Several movie industry people were really nervous about the fully animated photorealistic characters and backgrounds from Final Fantasy: The Spirit Within. Many thought that the film would start a string of films where you wouldn't even have actors acting, just providing voices. Fortunately(or unfortunately), the film had stunning visuals but real bad story and just about everything else. So we have the digital stage, where everything besides certain props and the actors are filmed and everything else is computer. It looks great but we're a little way off from making the best use of this technology.<br /><br />Scientists keep disappearing and a man named Totenkopf is behind it. Reporter Polly Perkins(what a name huh?) finds out that scientists involved in some experiences were being taken and she finds out just in time before the Iron Giant-sized robots attack New York. So enter Sky Captain, saves Polly and takes down a robot.<br /><br />And with the help of Dex, Sky Captain's whiz-kid sidekick and one of his old flames, Franky, him and Polly try to figure out why Totenkopf is doing this and why it spells a certain end for Earth. All this gets them going all over the world flying over oceans and even swimming under them and going to Nepal to save the world.<br /><br />Like Sin City, all of the sets and backgrounds were CG while only the actors and certain interactive things were used. But the use of CG doesn't make photorealistic images that are indistinguishable from reality. They look real but you can instantly tell it isn't a real set. The film kind of has this stylized blurry look, even the actors almost have a golden shade on them.<br /><br />Along with Sky Captain, movies that have digital backlots are Sin City, Casshern(a japanese movie) and Immortel(italian) so we're still really recent with the technology but there's obviously bound to be more that'll show up.<br /><br />As a film it works mainly for its spectacle but when you start analysing everything such as plot holes, it sinks but if you don't bother thinking of it, you'll find you'll probably enjoy it. Maybe.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>Started off awesome! I was intrigued by the whole "old movie" thing.

Set around the year 1939, the story creates a highly fictitious world that is seemingly free of Nazis in Germany (they are certainly never mentioned), but does mention fighting in Asia, though Japan is never directly mentioned as being involved.  Instead, in this near-utopian vision of 1939, passengers travel from Europe to New York aboard a dirigible named the "Hindenburg III" that lands by attaching itself to the never-used airship landing cone on top of the Empire State Building.  (In this idealized setting, passengers disembark the airship via a long stairs over 100 floors above the streets below with no concern about winds that could easily blow the airship--and them--into a very precarious position.)  The film then focuses upon the first of its three principal characters: a newspaper reporter by the name of Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow), who becomes interested in the disappearance of six noted scientists around the globe.  All of them had worked together on a secret German project before WWI, but only one of the original seven was still free: Dr. Jennings (Trevor Baxter).  Polly meets Dr. Jennings at a theater playing "The Wizard of Oz", but everyone is interrupted by an onslaught of giant, flying robots that attack New York; to which, a panicked radio operator sends an immediate plea for help to the film's second principal character known as Sky Captain (Jude Law).  He rushes to New York in his highly advanced British Spitfire and eventually comes across Polly, who had previously dated him.  Once the giant robot threat subsides, Sky Captain and Polly travel to his secret airbase where is faithful and highly inventive assistant, Dex (Giovanni Ribisi), has been studying the robots; but their arrival is interrupted by another robotic attack, which is lead by a mysterious woman (Ling Bai).  Being very resourceful, Dex is able to determine that the robots are being controlled from somewhere in Shangri-La.  To have enough fuel to reach Shangri-La, Sky Captain and Polly are assisted by the film's third principal character: an officer in the British Royal Air Force, Franky (Angelina Jolie), that commands the equivalent of a flying aircraft carrier.  It is up to them to find out who is controlling the robots and what his fiendish plot may be.<br /><br />"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" may be the first film to have been shot almost entirely in front of blue screens because aside from the human actors, everything else is computer-generated graphics.  The robots, flapping-wing planes, flying aircraft carriers and planes that can travel underwater are all very impressive special effects, but visual effects alone cannot define the overall quality of a film, especially when the story (which is set in a fictitious representation of the past) feels dated from the get-go and too unrealistic to fully engage an audience.  Had this film been produced in the late 1930's (of course, without the aid of computer graphics), the story would have probably been similar to the early Buck Rogers serials of the period and probably had been better received by an audience unfamiliar with today's technological advancements.  However, creating such a film today, though visually impressive, simply fell short of what a most people in a twenty-first century audience expect.  Consequently, my overall rating for "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" is 3 out of 5 stars.  Clearly, Kerry Conran is a highly creative individual and I expect to see more visually impressive films from him in the future.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7GHG2XNYO3J.html">A1I7GHG2XNYO3J</a><br/><p>Im at a bit of a loss on how to describe this movie, perhaps an action adventure, sci-fi, film noir. What ever you call it there is non stop action and the film truly has a 1940's serial feel to it. While the "critics" didnt seem to like it much i was very much taken with the effects and for once in a modern film the comic relief was refreshingly comic. While im sure its not for everyone i would recomend this movie as one of the better ones to come from the ever failing hollywood. Where remakes and shallow attemps at drama abound this one is truly unique and quite a fun watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A3F3B6HY9RJI04.html">A3F3B6HY9RJI04</a><br/><p>The director of this movie apparently wanted to create something that reminded us about the old Science Fiction theater days.  However, all it did was remind me of why people don't make movies like this and why Science Fiction Theater 3000 got many laughs from an implausible plot and horrible acting.  The sad thing is... this seemed intentional.<br /><br />If you are looking for something different from today's science fiction, this might be for you.  If you are looking to see what science fiction used to look at, you might like to take a peak at this.  If you tend to like the direction science fiction is headed and don't want to look back, skip this movie.<br /><br />I fit the in the last category and wish I hadn't wasted money on this rental or the time invested to sit through it all.</p></br><a href="../users/AMIGVTZZIWS6I.html">AMIGVTZZIWS6I</a><br/><p>I skipped seeing this movie at the theatre because it just didn't seem good enough for me to spend $20 on tickets and concessions, and I'm glad I did.  I really did want to like this movie.  I enjoyed the story idea, the technological "wow" factor, the homage to 1940s serials; but the wooden acting and hackneyed plot just brought the movie down.  Yeah, the whole technological razzle dazzle was a sight to behold, but too many times you could tell that the actors were standing in front of fake scenery and each time I saw Gwyneth Paltrow attempt to run around in those heels, I just had to chuckle; I mean, she looked more like she was running in place!  There are certainly some great moments in the film:  the arial battles, the 1940s look, and the inclusion of an actor who's been dead for more than 15 years.  Overall, it just wasn't enough to rate higher than three starts.  There is definately potential here and I hope the fact that the movie was a major flop in the theatres won't deter Conran or others like him from trying this again.  Just get a better story and work out some of the kinks.</p></br><a href="../users/A2V3P1XE33NYC3.html">A2V3P1XE33NYC3</a><br/><p>After viewing Kerry Conran's "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow," I was definitely looking forward to tomorrow. Here's a film that looks and feels so different from anything modern movie audiences are used to that it's sort of difficult to get your head around the whole thing. Maybe it had something to do with the techniques Conran used to create the movie. According to the featurettes on the DVD, he created everything we see on his computer. None of the sets existed in reality. Only the actors and actresses are real (although one can certainly make an argument that Gwyneth Paltrow is not real in any way, shape, or form--an argument for another day, alas), and they had to stand in front of blue screens and basically imagine what was going on. Conran filled in all the details later. This process creates an intriguing world--the equivalent of eye candy of a particularly delicious sort I must say--albeit one that doesn't favor a human focus. We're so caught up in the breathtaking visuals that the actors and the story sort of slide into the backseat. Truth be told, there isn't much of a story to tell. What story there is exists to showcase the visuals.<br /><br />The main character in "Sky Captain" is one Joe Sullivan (Jude Law), a sort of citizen of the world, James Bond type who flits around the globe saving us from evil. He owns a really cool underground base filled with planes and various high tech gadgets. He receives help in his missions from Dex Dearborn (Giovanni Ribisi), his head scientist and a crack inventor. Whenever trouble erupts, Sullivan, otherwise known as the Sky Captain, hops in his trusty plane and flies to the scene of the crime. His latest mission promises to be a doozy. Gigantic robots are rampaging through the streets of New York, smashing their way through buildings and sending the civilian population into a frenzy. What sort of madness is this? That's for Sky Captain to find out. Fortunately, his old flame Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) is on the case. She's a hard driven reporter who possesses such a cool demeanor that she's calling her story into the paper as the robots rampage. Sullivan and Perkins must team up, amidst much wisecracking, to unlock the mystery of the robots and to stop the heinous evil behind them.<br /><br />Their adventures take them from place to place in a non-stop flurry of activity that leaves the viewer breathless. The two literally fly around the world, and under the ocean, to save the world. They discover that one Dr. Totenkopf, a World War I German scientist and all-around jerk, is the man behind the metal behemoths. He resides in an enormous complex located on a secret island guarded by all sorts of perilous henchmen. Before they can pay a visit to Totenkopf, however, Sullivan and Perkins must protect the contents of a couple of mysterious vials, and they must also rescue Dex Dearborn, who was captured during a raid on the Sky Captain's airfield. It's a tall order, but fortunately our dynamic duo can rely on the gregarious Franky (Angelina Jolie with a really cute hat and an eye patch), the commander of a British air fleet that floats, literally, through the air. Franky and the Sky Captain have a past of their own to work through, much to the consternation of Polly, but the assistance rendered by the Brits helps move the adventure along to its over the top conclusion at Totenkopf's over the top fortress. It makes sense that none other than the late Laurence Olivier plays the evil doctor.<br /><br />I couldn't hate this movie if I tried. "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" bombed big time at the box office, but a lot of critics loved it. I can see why reviewers went gaga over this flick. I think several elements factor into the critical praise. One, it's the plot and style of the film, the way Conran took the 1930s serial actioner and brought it into the modern day, that wins plaudits. The color scheme alone, a mix of blurry browns and blues that makes the movie look like a photograph taken in 1935, shows a love for old movies that literally leaps off the screen. Two, the fantastical elements, the sheer over the top effects seen in every frame of the film, take the viewer back to the heady days of childhood when going to the movies meant stepping into a magical world far different from reality. Three, and finally, the banter between the characters mirrors in no small part the sort of wordplay one would see in an old black and white movie. Movie reviewers think of films in a different way than most people. They really believe that a film should transport the viewer to a different time and place, and they're willing to applaud a movie that does just that. This is why they liked "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow".<br /><br />Despite the poor box office, I think "Sky Captain" has already proved its influence on the future of film. Just watch "300". A lot of what we see there, in a technical sense, originated with Kerry Conran's picture. Needless to say, the DVD presentation is nearly flawless. The picture and audio quality will make your jaw drop, especially if you watch this on one of those big, fancy television screens. Extras include a couple of commentary tracks featuring Conran, producer Jon Avnet, and selected members of the visual effects crew. We also get a few featurettes giving us a behind the scenes look at the film's production as well as interviews with members of the cast. A gag reel, some trailers, deleted scenes, and the original six-minute film Conran made to sell the idea to a studio round out the disc. Whew! So there you go. Check this one out posthaste.

Conran needs to get on with Lucasfilm, or Dreamworks SKG.  He has the same eye and more importantly, the same sense of artistry that Spielberg and Lucas have.  He understand that the camera is for framing, and not merely recording, and is almost virtual actor<br /><br />You really feel that you are in the retro-future of Art Deco, balancing Fritz Lang and Flash Gordon.<br /><br />There are only two weak points: the storyline and the casting (not the acting).<br /><br />On the DVD, you can see the 6-minute short that was used to pitch the film.  I think Conran spent so much time working on the visuals that he neglected to think out the whole story line.  That is why the first 10 minutes of the film seems luscious, and slowly gets thinner as the film progresses.<br /><br />Another problem was with the "McGuffins."  The movie begins with the German scientist with the Adam and Eve test tubes and the plans to the Mechanical Monsters, but these are ignored as the movie progresses. This is disconcerting, since the expectation is that the whole plot of the movie will hinge on these two objects.  As the film runs past the two McGuffins, we move from McGuffin to McGuffin-the bubble-gummed map, the information that leads to Monster Island, and so forth.  We are given a thread, but it just snaps in the middle of the movie.<br /><br />Admittedly, this film is an homage to serials and the 1930's films, which are disconnected and fragmented, but having a smooth McGuffin would have made the film easier to watch.  Follow Spielberg's and Lucas's lead in Episode IV and Raiders by holding the story together with one McGuffin.<br /><br />Secondly, the casting is . . .I'm not sure different is the right word.  Jude Law would not be my first or even last pick of the Sky Captain.  He delivers the lines accurately, is believable, and took a professional risk doing a film like this.  But having an effete, British pretty-boy play the Air Cowboy almost works, but it is not what you would expect with such a unique film.<br /><br />Gwyneth was a good pick. She looks like could be from the 1930s, and has the hair to suit the role. However, mid way through the film she falls out of character and acts like a 1990s woman.<br /><br />I thought the banter dialogue was superb and makes the film relatable. However, the 1930's had a unique form of slang that, except for Jolie, no one picks up on.  The slang-which can be read in the Doc Savage and Lensman stories adds color to the ear, and is as important as chronologically-sound costuming and props.<br /><br />By the way, Jolie with an eye patch was an unusual move.  It hearkens back to Nick Fury, but looks rather weird on a British Dominatrix. Wasn't this first done in "Twin Peaks?"<br /><br />The last complaint has to do with the robots.  In order to have the technology, you need money, and remember there is a Depression going on. Also, the hovering hunchback robots were a bit too much.  It crossed the line of believability.  After all, if Totenkopf has the technology to have antigrav in robots, he could have put it on the rockets.</p></br><a href="../users/A3TNM3C9ENUCFW.html">A3TNM3C9ENUCFW</a><br/><p>I have to confess to finding this movie very difficult to review for a number of reasons, the main ones being the extremely implausible and silly plot, and some bad casting. I think people will either love or hate this movie, with little chance for middle ground, but whichever way you fall, you have to admire Writer/Director Kerry Conrans, vision and resolve in getting this (his first movie) onto the big screen. This is a loving homage to a bygone era of Biggles, Saturday morning heroes, 50's Sci Fi movies, and the Wizard of Oz. It is fantastical, tongue in cheek, inventive yet predictable but somehow it's just TOO much of a mixed bag for my taste. The complete blue screen CGI production gave Conran unlimited artistic licence, and the effects are impressive, even if they are almost a pastiche on old Sci Fi flicks, and serial cliffhangers. The trouble is that he has deliberately shown them as special effects, the sepia drenched resolution throughout, and not exactly seemless matching of live action with CGI is obviously on purpose in trying to emulate the back cloths, rockets on string, and dodgy effects of the aforementioned films, on which this is loosely based. If (and it's a sizeable IF) you can embrace this idea, you will love the movie, but the average viewer will probably be completely misled by the trailers, DVD sleeve, and advertising, and think EH?. It helps to understand that Conran spent 4 years at home on his own computer making 6 minutes of screen time of this mythical "World of Tomorrow" and that was enough to sell the production team and actors. That said, most of the talent is wasted with the exception of Jude Law as the sprightly gentleman "hero" of the title. Of course, the script was not exactly taxing, and the supporting cast have adapted the role well, but Gwyneth Paltrow trying to be a female Indiana Jones style intrepid reporter was simply a job of bad casting, or was it? - perhaps this too was designed to mirror the often wooden performances in old B movies?<br /><br />This is not a bad movie, but it's really not one thing or another, and came across as a bit of a mess I felt - It'll probably hold your attention until the last reel, but my advice would be rent before you buy. I often watch movies many times, but one viewing was about all I could take here.</p></br><a href="../users/A2A6NH6DPE0VXR.html">A2A6NH6DPE0VXR</a><br/><p>Film critic Richard Roeper actually gave this thumbs down. That's proof that he's a boring person. This movie is a lot of things and bad isn't one of them. It's unique, fun, exciting and original. It has a look of a 30's adventure pic which makes it different from other films these days. I wouldn't mind sequels but this film didn't exactly get the audience it deserved. So their probably won't be more movies and that's a shame.<br /><br />  Jude Law plays a pilot trying to save the world from giant robots. Gwyneth Paltrow plays his love interest who's a journalist. They both are well casted and even look like actors from the 30's in this. They have good chemestry too. Roeper knocked Angelina Jolie saying she's horrible as her daredevil pilot character. I've seen much worse performances though and she's not in the movie enough to ruin it in anyway even if she was bad in it.  Roeper knocks her a lot though. Guess she turned down a date with him or something lol. Roger Ebert was right though. This movie is about as exciting as watching Raiders of the Lost Ark for the first time. Although it does run out of just a little steam before it is over but...just a little.</p></br><a href="../users/A1XJOSJN6FHFO0.html">A1XJOSJN6FHFO0</a><br/><p>I enjoyed this movie, to me it was a mix between Dick Tracy, Indiana Jones and Superman.  I know that sounds strange, but I think the main charcter Polly, who was a top reporter in a major city, reminded me of Lois Lane. Of course Sky Captain flew a plane but for some reason he reminded me of Jones.<br /><br />The main theme of the story is that a madman scientist has built an ark filled with animals and is planning to go out to space and destroy the world on his way.  Of course our couple must stop his plans.<br /><br />The movie has a surprise ending concerning the scientist and I think the ending was great. It has a tad of romance, plenty of adventure and some humor as well.  All in all an enjoyable show.</p></br><a href="../users/A146D2LYLICNLS.html">A146D2LYLICNLS</a><br/><p>I had good expectations for "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" and was looking forward to seeing it ever since I saw the first preview. It seemed like a highly original, entertaining flick with a great story to go along. While it definitely succeeds with the former, it fails big time with the latter.<br /><br />This movie has some of the coolest, most innovative special effects you'll ever see, there's no question about that. I was nothing short of impressed with the CGI, not to mention the cool "retro" look portraying a futuristic society in the 1930's. Basically, this movie had everything it needed to be great: an all-star cast, big budget and stunning visuals. But unfortunately, a lousy script and hollow story take away its full potential, to the point where it cannot be overlooked. Let's start with the script. There were several instances where people in the audience laughed out loud at the contrived, silly dialogue from the characters. Not all the script was bad; but what wasn't downright lame was only mediocre, so that's not saying much. And then there's the story. Equally as mediocre and uninspiring. Everyone is a cardboard cut-out. The audience is never given the chance to really care about them. Just when you think there might be some character development, a CGI battle sequence comes into play. They were certainly impressive, but there has to be a balance somewhere. And oh yeah, there's also some shameless product placement (Coca-Cola and Wrigley's chewing gum, I think Double Bubble as well) although it's not as bad as "I, Robot."<br /><br />In terms of performances, everyone is adequate, considering that they were simply "acting" in front of a blue screen. The always reliable Jude Law does the best he can with the script he's given to work with. Gwyneth Paltrow is also good although her performance comes across as campy at times. Angelina Jolie phoned this one in, that is, during the whopping 15 minutes that she's actually in the movie. So for any Jolie fans, know that you won't get to see much of her.<br /><br />I wanted to like "Sky Captain" a lot more than I did. I'm a fan of every actor and was hoping that they could carry it. But the lack of an intriguing plot and disposable script were a disappointment. This movie plays out more like a comic book, and perhaps that's what it should have been instead. It's got plenty of excellent eye candy, and if that's the only reason you go to movies then you'll surely enjoy it. But for anyone else who expects and hopes for a good story to go along with it, you'll probably leave the theater feeling uninspired. "Sky Captain" is not a bad movie, far from it. It has its merits. It's just not as good as it could have been, with all it had going for it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KY68OTSNHM3G.html">A3KY68OTSNHM3G</a><br/><p>Drawing on the huge popularity of 1950's science fiction and comics,  "Sky Captain" takes the viewer on an exciting journey complete with giant robots and a P-40 fighter that doubles as a submarine.<br /><br />The movie is set in the time period between World war I and World War II.  Reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) gets wind of a world takeover scheme by a mad German sceintist named Totenkopf.  Soon, New York City is being attacked by giant flying robots and other flying machines who are trying to steal the city's power generators.  Desperate, Polly calls on ex-boyfriend Joseph "Sky Captain" Sullivan for help.  He arrives just in time in his P-40 fighter plane and helps drive the robots off.  However, Joe's buddy Dex (Giovanni Ribini) believes that he can track the origin of the robots using radio waves.  After several attempts, he manages to track their base of origin to Nepal. So, Joe, Polly, Dex, and Franky Cook (Angelina Jolie), another of Joe's ex girlfriends and commander of a squadron of flying British aircraft carriers, set off to foil Totenkopf's plan, while braving more encounters with the robots and other mechanical enemies.<br /><br />The setting for the movie is something driectly out of a 1950's sci-fi film, complete with the giant, poldding robots, as well as a deviant scientist trying to take over the world.  The computer animation and special effects are very good.  I especially liked Jolie's force of flying aircraft carriers.  As for the story itself, I had a little problem following some parts of the movie, but overall, I thought the story was very well-conceived.  The acting by Jude Law and Giovanni Ribini is very good, but I thought Gwyneth Paltrow's character of Polly Perkins was not developed very well.  She tends to whine and complain a lot, especially about not having enough film in her camera to take as many pictures as she would like to.  I wish that Franky would have had a larger part in the movie; Angelina Jolie did an excellent job in her role.<br /><br />I think that people who watch this movie will enjoy it.  The story is, for the most part, exciting and fun to watch, and the special effects are extremely well done.  I recommend this movie.  Watch and get a feel of what science fiction movies were like in the 1950's.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>I can appreciate what the filmmakers tried to do here - pay tribute to those pulp comic books and campy sci-fi films of the Golden Era (which I love, by the way) while also trying to revolutionize the whole art of CGI effects - but there's really no hiding the fact that Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is one dog of a movie.  I'm not talking about an adorable little Yorkie or even a cute but annoying Chihuahua; I'm talking about one great big mangy, mud-covered, tick-infested, shaggy mutt of a dog.  The whole story is ridiculous, the script is consistently groan-inducingly dreadful, and the acting is about as bad as I've seen in a long, long time.  Don't count on Angelina Jolie (in little more than a cameo) to bail this one out; it's way too far gone before she ever shows up.<br /><br />So what do we have here?  Well, in what is best described as some futuristic 1930s world (and how crazy does that sound?), there's some mad scientist sending legions of humongous robots to reek havoc all over the world.  It's like The Iron Giant was seduced by the dark side of the force and then cloned a bazillion times.  On the ground, we have the intrepid and incredibly annoying reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow), who's on the story of several missing scientists when the giants attack.  Helpless authorities send out the equivalent of a bat signal to Sky Captain, aka Joe Sullivan (Jude Law).  This guy apparently spends all of his time flying in his P-40 just waiting for a call to save the world (and don't even get me started on the whole "gas mileage" issue).  As the story progresses, Perkins and Sky Captain team up to discover who is causing all of this mischief so they can track him down to his hidden lair and save the world.  In between aerial battles and visually incredible flying sequences, our two heroes constantly snipe at each other over their former love affair.  No matter how tense the action gets, or how few seconds the world is away from annihilation, these two always make the time to bicker like a couple of teenagers who just broke up.  The addition of Franky Cook (Angelina Jolie) aboard her top-secret flying platform somewhere over Asia only adds fuel to the extended lovers' spat.<br /><br />I won't even begin to describe all of the science fiction shenanigans writer-director Kerry Conran throws into this film (the words "everything but the kitchen sink" come to mind).  All of these special effects are, I suppose, the real selling point of the film.  They are - for the most part - quite impressive, and the whole movie certainly has a unique look and feel to it, what with basically everything but the prominent actors being a creation of CGI effects.  I'm sure the actors had quite a time performing all of their scenes in front of blue screens, but they never really had much of a chance given the mediocre script.  I have mentioned just how dreadful the dialogue in this film is, haven't I?  Conran doesn't just run a gag into the ground - he tunnels all the way through to China with it.  And it continues all the way through the final line; I really wanted to just slap somebody after this movie finally ended.<br /><br />As impressive as the CGI effects of this movie are, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow actually offers compelling evidence that CGI-created films such as this are not a good idea at all - I never bought into the idea that these characters were actually in the environment, and that necessarily prevented me from connecting to these characters at all.  Special effects do not a movie make.  I mean, a rose is pretty to look at, but I don't want to stare at one for over an hour and a half.  It really doesn't take very long for you to get used to the unusual look of this film, and after that point you're left with nothing more than bad actors delivering painful dialogue from a mediocre script.  My oohs and aahs were greatly outnumbered by my groans and "for Pete's sake" comments during the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3N8RZSXKN1OR2.html">A3N8RZSXKN1OR2</a><br/><p>It's probably no accident that this fast-paced, atmospheric movie has the feel of a '30's serial about it.  Set in a rather murkily-defined alternate world where dirigibles like the Hindenburg III still cruise the skies and World War II apparently took place well before it happened in our reality (and without Hitler), it finds intrepid "girl newshound" Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) and mercenary pilot Sky Captain (Jude Law) trying to fight through a past romantic history while attempting to find out who's responsible for the disappearance of a laundry list of European scientists and the creation of an array of sophisticated giant robots attacking New York City.  When the Captain's head mechanic Dex (Giovanni Ribisi) manages to isolate the region from which the robots' orders are being dispatched, he's kidnapped from his base, and now the hunt becomes personal.  With the help of Frankie (Angelina Jolie), the eye-patched commanding officer of a British airborne station, Polly and the Captain eventually track down the mysterious Dr. Totenkopf (Sir Laurence Olivier), only to discover that things aren't everything they seem.  With a nice mix of futuristic and '30's-era gadgetry and great digital SFX, this movie should appeal to anyone who enjoys the Indiana Jones franchise, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0038ZITIE">Flash Gordon</a>, or the original <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHQTZO">King Kong</a>.

This scientist has created robots who are overtaking New York.  There is a mysterious assassin trying to kill off all the remaining scientists who can prevent the apocalipse.<br /><br />Part adventure, part romance, part nostalgic movie set in art deco style, this film has feel and touch of the old era.  Although at one point there is a clip of the movie "Wizard of Oz" which must have been filmed more that 30 years ago.  That confused me a little bit.  If it was supposed to be a metaphor for Paltrow's character in this movie, I have not quite got the message.<br /><br />This movie is cute and unpretentious but easy to let go of once you've seen it.</p></br><a href="../users/A28GCEHD00JFZG.html">A28GCEHD00JFZG</a><br/><p>Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow: 8 out of 10: It was King Kong that made me fall in love with the movie. He doesn't appear himself (unlike ring mate Godzilla who cameos in silhouette in a Japanese newspaper.) but his ship and his friends are there and his tree is there. You know the moss covered tree that covers the impossibly deep chasm. To one he uses to fling helpless sailors to there death like some kind of lumberjack games blood sport. There the tree is in glorious faded color just as I left it in the imagination of my seven-year old self.<br /><br />I was enjoying myself up to that point mind you I had for one thing decided that this was an Anime rather than a regular film. (The giant robots make this illusion much more palatable as did an annoying performance by Miss Paltrow. In anime, the female characters are usually whining up a storm.) This allowed all the plot holes, substandard acting (along with Gwyneth Paltrow's overbearing performance we have the thespian talents of Jude Law) and scientific flubs to fall by the wayside. I just sat back and enjoyed the ride.<br /><br />A tour de force showing from Angelina Jolie as an eye-patch wearing British Commander also refreshes the movie halfway through. One wishes the film were about her and not the tepid whining leads.<br /><br />Much has been made of the use of CGI but let us face it. It is simply easier to put CGI effects on an artificial background rather than place them in photo-realistic settings as the snakes of Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid or the wolves in Day after Tomorrow have proved most recently.<br /><br />Sure Sky Captain is far from perfect. An actual villain would have helped and been more in line with the serials it was emulating. The dialogue sounds like George Lucas wrote it. In addition director Kerry Conran is more an art director than a story teller, but try telling that to the seven year old in me that kept saying, "Cool what's next".</p></br><a href="../users/A3LH77PBDFEO3F.html">A3LH77PBDFEO3F</a><br/><p>As a kid in the '60s, I used to watch the old sci-fi serials from my parents childhoods.

This science fiction adventure combines Flash Gordon with Fritz Lang's classic Metropolis creating a unique look for this pulp adventure. Jude Law stars as the wizard of the skies Joe Sullivan (AKA "Sky Captain") and Gwyneth Paltrow plays his love interest reporter Polly Perkins in an adventure where the existence of our world is threatened by a mad scientist (Laurence Oliver in a beyond-the-grave cameo performance that could only happen with the advent of digital technology. bend on wiping out humanity. Angelina Jolie turns in a wonderful cameo as the eye patch wearing pilot Captain `Franky' Cook. No pulp adventure would be complete without a plucky sidekick winningly embodies by the marvelous Giovanni Ribisi. While there are some time flight actors here, the real star of this movie is director/writer Kerry Conran who toiled for years in obscurity to make this film a reality. A fun visual feast featuring references to everything from King Kong to Marathon Man, Sky Captain turns into a treasure trove of other film experiences packed into an exciting adventure that everyone from kids to adults will enjoy. While it may not be high art, like Raiders of the Lost Ark its marvelous fun.<br /><br />Discussing the image quality is subjective here for a number of reasons. Since this film is designed to look highly stylized with gauzy soft focus and simulation of the old two color Technicolor process (which always seemed trapped between the world of color and black and white), it's hard to compare it to other films or their look. I can compare it to the original theatrical version of the film. Sky Captain on DVD carefully captures the look, texture and rich surreal color of the original theatrical version of the film. At times the images almost look like they revert to black and white imagery with touches of gray, flesh tones and light blue all capturing the look of early Technicolor films.  The 5.1 surround sound mix actively moves from speaker to speaker keeping in perfect step with the action and draping the listener in the experience of the film.  With witty visual allusions to the original RKO Radio logo, pulp fiction heroes of the 30's and early 40's and other films Sky Captain plays like an old film fan's wet dream.<br /><br /> "Brave New World" consists of  two documentaries on the making of the film. The first part focuses from conception to the birth of the six minute film Conran used to sell Jon Avent on making a feature film (which is included as an extra and with many images that ended up in the finished film with better detail) through to the design of the characters, robot monsters and the inspiration that they used from the pulp magazines. Part two discusses the actual production of the film and how it moved from the idea of using actual pictures of the late 30's and early 40's of New York as back plates to creating a highly stylized city in the computer for the actors and CGI creatures to interact in. Most of the six minute film was created with second hand computers. Sky Captain and the Flying Legion in the World of Tomorrow: Chapter One Mechanical Monsters (made on an old Apple Two) was presented to Paramount after the initial six minute demo was presented and Gwyneth Paltrow had signed on. Since there were virtually no sets Conran and visual effects people were constantly challenged by issues such as disc space, system failures and other gremlins that dog the computer world. Amazingly shot on a budget of $40 million and having to call in other effects houses at the last minute to help bring the film in on time and on budget, Sky Captain managed to walk the highwire of technology, creativity & commercial projects from Hollywood and be entertaining.<br /><br /> We get a comprehensive commentary track by the director and visual effects supervisors who discuss some of the more complex shots, visual tributes to other films and what's real and what's not. Overall, a fine commentary track that balances technical discussions with stuff that will interest the average film fan.<br /><br /> A fun bit of cinema that recalls Raiders of the Lost Ark with its retro feel and the serials of the 30's and 40's with the wit and technology of the 21st century, Sky Captain has all the fun that was squeezed out of franchise films, sequels and witty performances to boot. Sure, it's an imperfect film as the script occasionally reaches for more than it can convincingly pull off but for sheer visual style and ambition Sky Captain can't be beat.</p></br><a href="../users/A26HFSVLAGULIM.html">A26HFSVLAGULIM</a><br/><p>IN A NUTSHELL:<br /><br />This is a grand but light-hearted spectacle that goes beyond the farthest digital marker and still manages to deliver a story worthy of the epic experimental form.<br /><br />WHAT'S "SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW" ALL ABOUT?:<br /><br />In 2 words -- limitless possibilities. We have a grand story that fully utilizes the enormous scope of this epic digital production. Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law interact sensationally with sets that were literally never there. Unfortunately, they get tripped up and bogged down with a lot of mindless, out-of-place banter which gives the impression that there is poor chemistry between the two leads. Nevertheless, a new and exciting digital world has been created by the Conran brothers and they will be back with more for us to behold.<br /><br />This film sets up a very retro yet futuristic atmosphere, very much in the spirit of "Things To Come" which starred Raymond Massey [James Dean's father in East of Eden]. In Sky Captain, however, the universe that Raymond Massey could only hint at in "Things To Come" was actually constructed for us to see through the eyes of Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow.<br /><br />Naturally, our heros are fighting against all odds and the ticking clock to save the world. Fortunately, they have all the interesting and amazing gadgets they need to get the job done and amaze us in the process. Just like the sensational serials of the early television age, they offer everything we could want in a visual spectacle: Giant Evil Robots - Mad Scientists - Flying Aircraft Carriers - Fighter Planes that double as submarines - heroines with eyepatches - and some romance thrown in.<br /><br />IF YOU LIKED THIS FILM ALSO CONSIDER SEEING:<br /><br />"The Incredibles", "Mars Attacks", and, from the early days, "Superman: the Animated Series" (1940), "Mechanical Monsters" (1941), Dave Fleischer, "King of the Rocket Men" - Serial (1949), Fred Brannon.<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD:<br /><br />I have the "Special Collector's Edition" - Widescreen. They also offer this edition in "Full-Screen" format, but you can't get both formats in the same set. Having seen the film in both formats, I can't imagine getting the full-screen edition as it does lessen the awe-inspiring impact and the enormous scope of the digital sets. It also tends to break up some of the scenes as this film was clearly meant to be seen in widescreen format.<br /><br />DVD Features:<br /><br />Available Subtitles: English, Spanish; Available Audio Tracks: English (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround); Commentary by producer Jon Avent plus filmmaker Kerry Conran and the VFX crew; "Brave New World" featurette; "The Art of the World of Tomorrow" featurette; The original 6-minute short; Deleted Scenes and a Gag Reel</p></br><a href="../users/A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB.html">A2EGK0YRDF4ZZB</a><br/><p>"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" was Kerry Conran's one-man homage (the original six-minute short, included as an extra, was made on a Mac in his apartment, no less) to the sci-fi film serials of the 1930s and 40s, replete with snappy, sultry reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) in search of the ultimate scoop, cocky fighter pilot Joe Sullivan (Jude Law), the over-eager, clean-cut techno-whiz kid sidekick Dex (Giovanni Ribisi), and feisty, no-nonsense ex-flame Frankie (Angelina Jolie), commander of an airborne British squadron. I thought the actors did a wonderful job, especially when you consider that there were no sets, props, etc. to set the stage, so to speak.<br /><br />The film was completely created via CGI, and takes viewers from the Art Deco lines of New York to the gardens of Shangri-la on a quest to discover why giant robots are attacking cities around the globe. This is a film of unprecedented beauty, filled to the brim with every child's thrills: dinosaurs, robots, ray guns, dirigibles, rockets, airborne battles, and more, with a dash of romance and intrigue for the grownups. It's even more amazing watching the two-part documentary Brave New World, in which we see the soundstages and blue screens, completely devoid of props, etc. except for the actors and their marks. The costumes, music, and filmmaking lovingly recall the 1930s and 1940s, from the film titles to the sweeping orchestral themes. An experience not to be missed for fans of vintage sci-fi the gloriously cheesy sci-fi serials of decades past.</p></br><a href="../users/A13E0ARAXI6KJW.html">A13E0ARAXI6KJW</a><br/><p>This film reflects amazing visual invention, and first-time writer/director Kerry Conran, self-professed computer geek, has fashioned something remarkably singular from his fertile imagination, his obviously encyclopedic knowledge of pre-WWII popular culture, and most of all, his technological savvy. What he has created is impressive - a self-contained world of startling images that seem simultaneously futuristic and retro in a colorized black-and-white world bathed in diffuse lighting and stylized art deco designs. Moving like a speeding train, the plot is stuffed with so many references to other classic stories and movies it often gets overwhelming, and I have to admit some of the turns get very convoluted as a result. As a pop culture junkie myself, I see tributes to George Pal's "War of the Worlds", Ray Harryhausen's special effects in "Jason and the Argonauts", Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's "The Lost World", James Hilton's "Lost Horizon", Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World", Steven Spielberg's "Indiana Jones" trilogy and "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", George Lucas' "Star Wars" especially in the aerial chase scenes, and the stiff upper lip of British WWII films. Whew! That's a lot for a 103-minute film, but Conran does an extraordinary job of spinning his plates into a truly exciting film. Beyond that, it amazes me that most of the action was done against a blue screen, as the people and images seamlessly meld together. There are incredible sequences involving gigantic robots trampling New York, fanciful aerial air strips with dozens of fighter planes, swarms of automated winged weapons among others, and they are sequenced at a lightning-fast pace.<br /><br />The actors are well cast, though the best compliment one can pay them is that they don't get in the way of the action. In fact, their relative nonchalance to the extraordinary things going on around them is a major part of the fun. The omnipresent Jude Law, who is bordering on overexposure these days, cuts a dashing figure as the nominal hero, though he seems too lightweight and frankly a bit too earnest to be truly memorable. Ah, if Harrison Ford was only two decades younger... Gwyneth Paltrow plays the obligatory Lois Lane part, aptly named Polly Perkins, with a saucy mix of Veronica Lake's peek-a-boo allure (I love the skirt slitting shot) and Barbara Stanwyck's tough-dame savvy. Certainly this is quite a departure from the jetset vagabonds Law and Paltrow played in "The Talented Mr. Ripley", though their patrician attractiveness does confirm how well suited they are for period movies. In an all-too-brief part late in the film, Angelina Jolie is wonderfully gutsy as a veddy British naval captain, finally able to use her striking looks (not to mention her arresting eyepatch) to great effect. Not every actress can get away with a line like "Alert the amphibious squad!". In smaller roles, Giovanni Ribisi as the bubblegum-chewing Dex and British comedian Omid Djalili as Vienna sausage-loving Kaji seem to function purely as plot devices to move the story along. Conran understandably uses characters as chess pieces because the visual elements are what make this story percolate.<br /><br />I only wish Conran could have simplified the story a bit to let us absorb more of what's going on. I felt a little out of breath every time the locale changed since I wasn't sure I grasped everything I needed to know up to that point. I also think it's a bit of a conceit to "cast" the late Laurence Olivier as the primary villain since it feeds into one of the final plot twists. By the way, a great ending line awaits. Regardless, Conran is definitely a talent to watch, and it makes me wonder what he could possibly do next. Highly recommended fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A3USRUCHAOC3MT.html">A3USRUCHAOC3MT</a><br/><p>"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" is a masterpiece.  The movie was made with a blue screen, and the backgrounds were added.  They could have chosen to give a totally surreal feel to it as you have with the Batman series or "Dick Tracy", but it fit the setting perfectly.<br /><br />I would call this the 2000 attempt of "Raiders Of The Lost Ark".  There are many similarities between the two pictures, such as the time setting, the homage to 40's serials, the action, having a foreign sidekick, one graphic horrific death scene toward the end, and even having some of the action in Nepal.  This movie also borrowed from other action movies including Jurassic Park.<br /><br />This movie was very well done, but I actually didn't like it.  A movie like that is of course a time waster, but this one made me feel the time was wasted.<br /><br />One drawback is that the target audience seems to be an under thirty viewer who enjoys 40's movies.  This movie captures the 40's films even more effectively than Raiders, and that may be its undoing.  For this person who is more at home in the '70's and '80's, I found this movie in some ways before my time and in other ways after my time.</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p>Such a strange film: it is very like John W.

The plot focuses on air ace Sky Captain (Jude Law) and his relationship with intrepid reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) who eventually globetrot in efforts to track down and eliminate the robotic menace and its creator.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie has a role as a hotshot space captain in the back half of the movie and  character actor Giovanni Ribisi, whom you may remember starting out as a relative on the TV series "Friends", also has a supporting role.<br /><br />None of the stars are taxed by their roles because this movie is basically a cartoon on celluloid. The plot has some excitement but overplays its hand after an hour, when its intricacies are too many and you lose interest. The digital production creates a dark film noorish background completely unsuitable for sci-fi, where we are supposed to be able to see everyone and everything with crystal clarity.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this flick after seeing the ending a couple times on digital cable. But after sitting through the entire hour and 38 mintues, I wouldn't recommend you spend much money on it. A rental, maybe; a purchase, out of the question. With its star power and sci-fi adventure plot, I thought this  would be a fun night that could perhaps be repeated a couple times. As it turned out, I lost interest completely after an hour.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LXKO2S6G2DBI.html">A3LXKO2S6G2DBI</a><br/><p>Rumbling to life like the mechanical men that invade a fantasy New York City of the past, "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" is the kind of rip-snorting adventure that, dare I say it, they just don't make anymore.<br /><br />That said, it's far from perfect, with stale and predictable writing and leads Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow being not quite charismatic enough to distract us from watching the production, itself at once both truly amazing and irritatingly familiar.  In fact, it's pretty easy to see the influences on "Sky Captain" -- from those that are acknowledged, like "Buck Rogers," to those that aren't, like "The Mysterians," "The Wizard of Oz," Max Fleischer's "Superman" cartoons, "When Worlds Collide," "Raiders of the Lost Ark," Gerry Anderson's various TV series, and more.<br /><br />As derivative as it is, "Sky Captain" unfolds with an exuberant, child-like grace.  No, we don't really believe that a tricked-out P-40 can do all of the things that this one can, any more than we believe that dead Lawrence Olivier was somehow resurrected for one more role.  But the first half hour of "Sky Captain" is so fast-paced, cut and framed like a bona fide film from the 1930s, that it's easy to forgive the lapses in reason - or the standard effort to make a female character "strong" by making her mouthy and impulsive or a male character sensitive by having him put up with it.  Eventually, the film's editing and pacing synch up with more contemporary films, which is a shame, really.<br /><br />The plot is relatively simple, if hard to swallow:  giant robots begin looting cities while a team of scientists, each connected to a mysterious inventor named "Totenkopf," are assassinated one by one.  When all else fails, Sky Captain (Law, looking like the love child of Timothy Dalton and Ewan MacGregor) and his private air force are called in, reuniting the hero with - great Caeser's ghost - a plucky reporter (big-footed Paltrow) a former lover (sexy, one-eyed Angelina Jolie), and his inventor friend, Dex (Giovanni Ribisi, here a poor man's Mickey Rooney).  Of course, the mystery sends them globetrotting, and what they find may make them wish they could just click their heels and be home again.<br /><br />The best thing about "Sky Captain" is the production design, which is a marvel of computer-generated sets and gadgets mixed in with live action from the cast.  Director and writer Kerry Conran definitely has more of an eye for the look of the film than for the script, as he falls into the standard contemporary motif of having characters who should be working together nonetheless (yawn) bicker in the most absurd of situations.  In this film, it's a "Star Wars"-like race through dangerous corridors of air space framed by Gotham's skyscrapers.  And, like a lot of other filmmakers today dodging the pesky issues of a lack of diversity/stereotyping in their works, he gets mileage out of setting the film in the past and making Asians and thinly-veiled Nazis the bad guys -- you know, just like many U.S. and British films of the period.<br /><br />Nonetheless, "Sky Captain" is worth a look, though be warned:  If you don't fall immediately in love with Ed Shearmur's "Sky Captain" theme, you'd better put a bucket over your head and hit it with a wooden spoon `cause that ditty's pretty much played all through the film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TWIZ33KJCQ54.html">A2TWIZ33KJCQ54</a><br/><p>EXPERIMENTAL FORMAT DELIVERS THINGS TO COME FOR MOVIE LOVERS,<br /><br />IN A FEW WORDS ----<br /><br />This is a grand but light-hearted spectacle that goes beyond the farthest digital marker and still manages to deliver a story worthy of the epic experimental form.<br /><br />WHAT'S "SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW" ALL ABOUT?:<br /><br />In 2 words -- limitless possibilities. We have a grand story that fully utilizes the enormous scope of this epic digital production. Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law interact sensationally with sets that were literally never there. Unfortunately, they get tripped up and bogged down with a lot of mindless, out-of-place banter which gives the impression that there is poor chemistry between the two leads. Nevertheless, a new and exciting digital world has been created by the Conran brothers and they will be back with more for us to behold.<br /><br />This film sets up a very retro yet futuristic atmosphere, very much in the spirit of "Things To Come" which starred Raymond Massey [James Dean's father in East of Eden]. In Sky Captain, however, the universe that Raymond Massey could only hint at in "Things To Come" was actually constructed for us to see through the eyes of Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow.<br /><br />Naturally, our heros are fighting against all odds and the ticking clock to save the world. Fortunately, they have all the interesting and amazing gadgets they need to get the job done and amaze us in the process. Just like the sensational serials of the early television age, they offer everything we could want in a visual spectacle: Giant Evil Robots - Mad Scientists - Flying Aircraft Carriers - Fighter Planes that double as submarines - heroines with eyepatches - and some romance thrown in.<br /><br />ABOUT THE DVD:<br /><br />I have the "Special Collector's Edition" - Widescreen. They also offer this edition in "Full-Screen" format, but you can't get both formats in the same set. Having seen the film in both formats, I can't imagine getting the full-screen edition as it does lessen the awe-inspiring impact and the enormous scope of the digital sets. It also tends to break up some of the scenes as this film was clearly meant to be seen in widescreen format.<br /><br />DVD Features:<br /><br />Available Subtitles: English, Spanish; Available Audio Tracks: English (Dolby Digital 5.1), French (Dolby Digital 2.0 Surround); Commentary by producer Jon Avent plus filmmaker Kerry Conran and the VFX crew; "Brave New World" featurette; "The Art of the World of Tomorrow" featurette; The original 6-minute short; Deleted Scene<br /><br />-----*- IF YOU LIKED THIS FILM ALSO CONSIDER SEEING --<br /><br />"The Incredibles", "Mars Attacks", "Superman: the Animated Series" (1940), "SUPERMAN - Mechanical Monsters" (1941), Dave Fleischer, "King of the Rocket Men" - Serial (1949), Fred Brannon.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>In "Sky Captain", Joe (Jude Law" fights to save the world from a mysterious onslaught of hulking, flying and blasting machines bent on...some diabolical mission.  Along with a nosy newspaper reporter (Paltrow) and with some help from the one-eyed commander of a brigade of British fliers, Joe tracks the machines across the world.  Joe's weapon of choice: a P-40 Hawk tricked out with all sorts of James Bond type gearJoe links the machines with a mysterious scientist named Tottenkopf, and a mysterious plan called "The World of Tomorrow".  Can Joe solve the mystery before...well before it's too late?<br /><br />This was an immensely disappointing movie.  Virtually everything in "Sky Captain" is borrowed from somewhere else - from the "Indiana Jones" movies to the Fleischer "Superman" animated shorts of the 1930s; from "Flash Gordon" to "Jurassic Park", from "The Wizard of Oz" to "Far Horizons" - so that you spend less time enjoying the movie, and more time combating a stiff case of deja-vu.  When it isn't regaling you with its grasp of other films, TV shows or comic books, "Sky Captain" tosses you generic CGI combat scenes - like those between Joe and a squadron of flying robots through midtown Manhattan, or Angelina Jolie and her squadron up against the robots below the waves of the Pacific.  Rather than transitioning from one scene to the next, "Sky Captain" just jumps into different famous movies - even the identity of the mysterious Tottenkpf is a form of homage.  The special effects aren't all that special - though the CGI seamlessly blends live-action with computer animation, the overall effect breathes less life into the animated parts than simply turn it all into a big cartoon.</p></br><a href="../users/A152C8GYY25HAH.html">A152C8GYY25HAH</a><br/><p>"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" is a movie that will be better appreciated in the future than it is today.  Its advanced technology was lost on today's audience, which could not comprehend it. It's a technophiles dream. It's also an ode to almost every action flick Hollywood has ever made.<br /><br />I could say a lot more, but I want you to actually SEE this movie and decide for yourself,</p></br><a href="../users/APOGXH3A74CM3.html">APOGXH3A74CM3</a><br/><p>For me, this film was nothing short of stunning!  Combining elements from the classic film serials with modern technology to produce a timeless look and feel, this film moves along at a nice clip with lots of action and subtle comedic moments.  I felt exhilarated after seeing this and was highly entertained.  I see lots of potential for this type of film making, something I felt when I saw the first Star Wars film (though the magic is gone from the Lucas' franchise) - I hope to see more of the Sky Captain type of story telling...</p></br><a href="../users/A1KAR9G699RM56.html">A1KAR9G699RM56</a><br/><p>Skycaptain has that comic book feel, which matches its all to comic book story.  Picture this: scientists are disappearing, giant robots pop up randomly across the globe, and Jude Law's character with his Flying Tiger style airplane is the worlds hope.  Now that's a comic book plot.<br /><br />You know what?  I saw almost no advertising, except for one poster, thus I had actually a rather bad presumption of the film (although I try not to pre-judge.)  When it comes down to it though, the story was interesting enough to keep the viewer watching, but not nessecarily too deeply.<br /><br />The largest fault in my mind was the style.  I mean could anyone really see what was going on because of how dark everything appeared to be?  Maybe that's because Skycaptain was the first film done entirely with green screen, or maybe that is not it.  On top of that issue, the story is just chock full of holes.  Not questions to be answered just spots of boredom.  On top of that, another Jude Law film, which for those who don't or won't remember 2004 should no it as the year we Jude'd too many.<br /><br />  Summarily, those looking for Jolie will be suprised by her brevity on screen, and those looking for Jude will wonder why everything looks like a pit.  All in all, the movie was mere popcorn entertainment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E85KPLPYVW8E.html">A1E85KPLPYVW8E</a><br/><p>Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow does deserve credit in the visual effects department. A lot of the CGI in this film is just beautiful. But as it succeeded in producing eye opening visuals, its storyline was unmatched in strength. The plot was weak overall and rather formulaic. Another thing that made me mad about this flick was that Agelina Jolie, as it seemed to me, was advertised in the trailers as a major character in the film. I actually expected her to be the Sky Captain or the villian, but as it turned out she had a very minor role and had about 10 minutes of show time.<br />If you're into $150 million dollar budgets that are overflowing with special effects and action scenes and you could care less about story or character development, this one's for you. If you are not easily distracted by massive visuals in a movie and pay attention to storyline, you might or might not want to skip this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYOHNGQ1WED1.html">A1CYOHNGQ1WED1</a><br/><p>First, this movie is beautiful to watch. The way it was filmed is stunning and the special effects are amazing. The story itself harkens back to the days of the pulp science fiction novels and the old movie serials where the plots got more outlandish as the story went along. With all of this I was anxious to see the movie, but it ultimately disappoints. Some of the scenes are poorly set-up and the dialog is very bad at times. Gwyneth Paltrow is terrible as the female lead. This has more to do with the material than her abilities, but it's bad nonetheless. I found her character to be shrill and irritating and couldn't wait for her to be off the screen during her scenes. More time needed to be spent on the story and especially the interactions between characters. Special effects this good are one thing, but they can't make up for a script that is lacking.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow was quite a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, and Giovanni Ribisi among others.<br /><br />In short, the acting is pretty good (but nothing great), the special effects are excellent, and the plot is way below average.<br /><br />Specifically, the characters are plain, weak and not original at all.<br /><br />There is the usual German "bad guy" clich&eacute;, and together with the usual "doomsday machine" in the shape and form of a modern Noah's Arc do not help in making this film anything special or out of the ordinary.<br /><br />Moreover, it seems as though the chemistry between Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow is not all that great.  To that, one has to add the poor dialogues and the bad choice of lines that the actors are given (what were the writers thinking?).  To make things worse, Giovanni Ribisi who is otherwise a great actor, was presented with a very uninteresting/unoriginal character to play (the overly intelligent young scientist) with whom he could not really do much.  A bit of a waste there...<br /><br />Furthermore, apart from the humor-or lack of it-there are major weaknesses in the story, such as when it just so happened that Dex and the other scientists were escaping their robot captors at the same time as the heroes were entering the secret stronghold, thus providing too much of a convenient coincidence for the benefit of both groups.<br /><br />On the positive side, the 1930's were a very good choice for the setting of the movie.<br /><br />The film is action packed so those with a soft spot for adventure will enjoy it!<br /><br />In addition, they've done a very good job of giving the film the darkness that one finds in that genre of cartoon strips.<br /><br />To a certain extent, the film is a cross between Jurassic Park and the Lost World on the one hand, and James Bond's Moonraker and the Indiana Jones trilogy on the other.<br /><br />Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.<br /><br />A shame really...<br /><br />In a nutshell, it's probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, but it will provide for an evening's entertainment, and that's about it;<br /><br />No masterpiece here...</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>Kerry Conran's "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" is a visually-stunning tribute to the science-fiction films of yesteryear.  Yet, when you get past the breathtaking production design, you find yourself watching a film that is just a smidge more sophisticated than those Commando Cody shorts that used to air on "Mystery Science Theater 3000."<br /><br />Joe "Sky Captain" Sullivan (Jude Law) is always there to save the day whenever danger threatens.  He is reunited with old flame Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) when giant robots invade Manhattan.  It turns out that the robots are part of a dastardly plan conceived by the mysterious Doctor Totenkopf (Laurence Olivier).  With the help of Franky Cook (Angelina Jolie), the captain of a British airship, Joe and Polly set out to defeat the villainous mastermind.<br /><br />If the story of "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" seems bare-boned, it is because it is bare-boned.  Conran apparently was not content with just recreating the look and feel of the science-fiction films of the past.  He also duplicates the pedestrian scripts and one-dimensional characters that characterized the more cheesy entries in the genre.  It is too bad that such a tepid screenplay undermines all the hard work done to give "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" its distinctive look.  Law, Paltrow, and Jolie do their best but they are trapped in a film that completely disregards substance in its pursuit of style.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWSFRCIMOAYE.html">AYWSFRCIMOAYE</a><br/><p>When I watched it in the theatre, it's in black and white but it's enjoyable movie.

The look of the film, which was done entirely against a blue screen, is great, and the acting, with the exception of Gwyneth Paltrow as reporter Polly Perkins, is very good; Paltrow plays the heroine in a much too whiny way, which gets annoying quickly.  Also, Angelina Jolie does not appear until an hour into the film and then is not on the screen enough after that.  The creatures and special effects are awesome, and the plot is good -- true to the movies it's trying to emulate.  I would recommend this film to those who like special effects, sci-fi, Jude Law or old adventure movies.<br /><br />Extras include two commentary tracks, a gag reel, 2 deleted scenes, an original 6-minute short, a 50-minute feature about the effects and a shorter featurette about the style.<br /><br />The film can be heard in English or French, and subtitles are available in English or Spanish.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>My first question:  why in the world did the producers and directors of this film decide to use the "ghost" of the great Sir Laurence Olivier in this movie?  It doesn't seem at all necessary and its cleverness merely elicits a scratch of the head from this reviewer.  Oh, well, guess they thought it would be "original?"<br /><br />Anyway, this film, a digital masterpiece, is a wonderful homage to the films of the 30s 40s and 50s, gorgeously colored and with awesome digital effects.  It is most definitely an eye candy movie, its acting and plot overshadowed by the sheer artistry of the special effects crew.  Suffice to say, Jude Law, Angelina Jolie and particularly Gwyneth Paltrow have never looked more beautiful or stunning.  Giovanni Ribisi is excellent as always in a smaller role, but the real star of the movie is its visionary director, Kerry Conran.  Although I wouldn't want to see a lot of movies filmed in this manner, one must admit the excellence and hard work that went behind it.</p></br><a href="../users/A21VGNU5959O85.html">A21VGNU5959O85</a><br/><p>I have a confession to make; I do not like Gwyneth Paltrow. It's not because she is anti-American, or that she fakes a British accent every chance she gets, it's not even because she named her children Apple and Moses therefore subjecting them to a lifetime of fruit and biblical jokes. I don't like her because she is not a good actress, it's as simple as that, and it's all my opinion of course because some people think she is the next Meryl Streep (laughs uncontrollably). Having stated this, I will say that I loved this Movie! Yes, I could even look past Miss Paltrow to see the merits of this film. I had seen the coming attractions, and said "no" because of Gwyneth, even though it looked really interesting. Finally I broke down and told myself "it has robots, and planes, and Jude and Angelina" and in the universe that I live in all those things counteract her. She isn't horrible in this, she is just as staccato, and blank faced as she usually is, but it works for her character. Jude Law is okay, as well as Angelina, the script really didn't allow for any Oscar moments, the REAL star of this movie was the Special Effects. The whole movie was just gorgeous and creative; it's like no movie I have ever witnessed. If you are a fan of old black and white movies, classic Sci Fi and just plain originality you will love it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2DSXA1E02C86D.html">A2DSXA1E02C86D</a><br/><p>I don't know. I guess I've lost somewhere my capacity for childhood wonder.<br /><br />Here in the mid-1930s, downtown New York and perky newspaperwoman Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) are menaced by a horde of giant, flying robots (apparently) created by the mysterious German scientist, Dr. Totenkopf. To the rescue of Polly and the Big Apple comes Joe "Sky Captain" Sullivan (Jude Law) piloting a souped up Curtiss P-40 Tomahawk complete with teeth painted on the plane's nose as last seen on Claire Chennault's Flying Tigers of World War II fame. Sullivan is (apparently) an Army pilot flying out of a nearby, semi-secret air base. In any case, the airfield is soon devastated by giant robots of a different sort, which (apparently) kidnap Joe's Head of TechnoWhiz, Dex Dearborn (Giovanni Ribisi), but not before the latter manages to convey the information that Totenkopf's HQ is (apparently) in Nepal. So, off Sullivan and Perkins go to save the world and get a scoop, respectively.<br /><br />While the visual presentation of SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW, done in a combination of richly colored elements against a background of sepia tones, is stunning, the plot is incomprehensible. Totenkopf and intentions remain pretty much nebulous, although his evil plan (apparently) involves a space ship designed to carry a male and female of the Earth's various species, like Noah's Ark, to ... where? Say, what? And the implied connection between Totenkopf and his stylized skull insignia with that of the Nazi SS-Totenkopfverbande (Death's Head Organization) was either too transparent or too obscure, I'm not sure which; the scriptwriters (apparently) remained on the fence about that one.<br /><br />I found Paltrow attractive, as usual, but there seemed minimal vibes between Polly and the Sky Captain. From the dialogue, we infer that the two formerly had a complicated relationship as Joe repeatedly voices his suspicion that Polly had previously cut the fuel line of his airplane causing it to crash - a charge Perkins consistently denies. What was that all about? I suspect that the couple's past history was more interesting than the present. In any case, there wasn't the delicious tension between the two as in, for example, ROMANCING THE STONE with Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner.<br /><br />There was one silly sequence in which Sullivan's Tomahawk retracts its air screw, dives into the ocean, deploys a water propeller, and continues on as a submarine as if nothing was amiss. Oh, puhleeeze! Chennault would've been appalled.<br /><br />SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW was perhaps best seen on the Big Screen, or now maybe viewed on a gazillion-inch, home entertainment center HDTV. But, on my 27-inch standard TV, it just seemed silly with a capital "S". Wait for the comic book version.</p></br><a href="../users/A391YPR0NFTCLK.html">A391YPR0NFTCLK</a><br/><p>This movie is so awesome! The effects are great and the movie is so much fun.

But it is entertaining because it is so absurd that we do not even try to understand what is happening after a while, we just follow the lead or leash of you feel you can afford a more doglike nature. And we wait for the last spoken remark of that film "Lens cap" that is absolutely exhilaratingly funny.

Who wouldn't love a rollicking yarn set in the glorious adventure hey-days of pre-WWII?  With intrepid heroes with intrepid names like Joseph "Sky Captain" Sullivan (Jude Law) and Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) engaging in derring-do against a dastardly villain and his titanic robotic minions, what could possibly go wrong?<br /><br />Suffice it to say that for the first ten minutes of "Sky Captain" I was enchanted.  A glorious scene where the Hindenburg III flies through a snow-storm to dock atop the Empire State Building, with various and sundry characters looking gravely concerned and on the verge of panic sets the stage for both grandeur and a suitably sinister plot.<br /><br />What a let-down!  The movie quickly devolves into a murky plot involving some kind of invasion and some kind of plot involving super-secret scientists.  And the performances by this normally-stellar cast are uniformly wooden (with Angelina Jolie the lone exception as the delectable, one-eyed Commander Franky Cook) -- it's almost like George Lucas was in charge.  For actors such as Law, Paltrow, and Giovanni Ribisi to have so many flat, empty scenes is just shocking.  This is a movie where gigantic robots invade New York City, for Pete's sake, and yet in most scenes the actors deliver lines in sotto voce, a soft deadpan that is completely at odds with what is happening around them.  Why bring in the radiant Jude Law and make him act like a young John Gielgud?<br /><br />The plot of "Sky Captain" also has a lumpy, amorphous feeling to it.  Despite a wonderful set-up, we are denied much of an explanation of what is going on, and the "unique condition" of the villain denies us any climactic confrontations between good and evil.  For a movie that deals in such broad characterizations, this is a surprising twist that doesn't work.  Also, the villain has one interesting henchman - an acrobatic female assassin -- who ultimately fails to deliver on her awesomely diabolical potential.  She is no Darth Maul!<br /><br />All in all, Kerry Conran and team have made a landmark film with "Sky Captain," but only on the technical side.  The movie is easily one of the best-looking films I've ever seen, and there are several scenes of considerable imagination and craft.  And yet Conran's bunch was unsuccessful in uniting their amazing vision with the human craft of acting.  The movie feels disjointed, and you can almost picture the actors performing in front of a blue-screen against imaginary backdrops that will be added in later by CGI.  Disbelief cannot be suspended, and as a result, the movie fails.<br /><br />Worth a rental, "Sky Captain" is not essential for any movie library except for its technical expertise.  Here's hoping that Conran and team get another shot at using their amazing technology to tell a great story.</p></br><a href="../users/A37ZOGOK3GKF2P.html">A37ZOGOK3GKF2P</a><br/><p>Watching this movie is like eating jell-o jigglers.  Fascinating to look at, but very little susbstances inside.  That's OK.  Sci-fi and action films are supposed to be attractive on screen, then worry about plot, logic, and solid steady direction.  A great deal of effort went into this film and it is very enjoyable as pure escapist entertainment, popcorn jewelry and nothing more.  The special effects are fantastic!  Revolutionary!  Mind Bending!  That's really all you need in sci-fi action.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF.html">A2UN5UY8Q6YMOF</a><br/><p>I have no idea how a movie with such a large budget like "Sky Captain" gets the green light to go forward.  The movie takes you on a whirl-wind trip from New York to Nepal to a hidden island in the Atlantic with the purpose of saving the world from a mad scientist.  Setting aside the fact that this is a tired plot, there is no convincing motivation for the scientist's actions.  Supposedly he is building a space ship to function as a Noah's Ark in order to start a new world, but he is going to blow up the Earth just for spite?  The movie does capture that 1930's Buck Rogers feel quite well-perhaps a bit too well with bad acting and cheesy special effects brought along as well.  Jude Law is poorly cast as the lead hero.  He is completely unconvincing as an action star. Of course, his character bumbles through the movie and needs saving several times.  I've never seen a lead action hero accomplish so little in a story.  Gwenneth Paltrow plays an annoying career-driven reporter and her acting is surprisingly bad.  Angelina Jolie is competent is a very minor role.  Not only was I disappointed with this movie, but also bored as well despite all the action.  This one is not even worth renting.</p></br><a href="../users/A31U2QT7SAL7K.html">A31U2QT7SAL7K</a><br/><p>Over two decades ago, the Disney film "Tron" with its computer-generated images was supposed to revolutionize filmmaking.  Coupled with a rather weak script and wooden direction, the film didn't accomplish its goal at the time, only recently acquiring "cult" status.<br /><br />2004's "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" was supposed to do the same thing, and may have accomplished that feat in a mild way, showing that a movie could be created with actors responding to direction while acting on a blue screen set.  Unfortunately, there lies the film's biggest weakness.  The actors seem unsure as to what they are reacting and it shows.  Like such effects-laden predecessors as "Godzilla" and "Spawn," the performers' reactions are either too slow or quirky, revealing the actors' doubts about how they should respond to the director's on-screen intent.<br /><br />Combining cutting-edge computer effects, comic book-like espionage, elements of film noir (in sepia tones, no less), globetrotting daring do, and 1930's set pieces, the film is too over-the-top to be believed.  The producers may have thought they were paying homage to early films but I feel that they borrowed a bit too heavily from the older, and much better, films.<br /><br />Check out the sound effects of The Iron Giant-like robots' laser beams, identical to those produced by the Martian spacecraft in George Pal's "War of the Worlds".  The battles over the skies of Manhattan look like they were lifted from any installment of Max Fleischer's "Superman" shorts of the 1940's.  Didn't Roger Moore have a car that turned into a submarine in 1977's "The Spy Who Loved Me"?  It might not be a car, but Law's plane does a remarkably similar feat.<br /><br />And how many times since 1937's real-life Hindenburg disaster can one see a dirigible explode???<br /><br />Besides the obvious "salutes" to "Metropolis" and "The Wizard of Oz," the film also lifts from "Mars Attacks" and "Jurassic Park".<br /><br />As for the cast, Jude Law is a bit too small in stature and refined to be the "rugged hero" and "savior of the world".  Gwyneth Paltrow tries her best to be "the girl Friday" but she's saddled with lines that are so awful that her drama teacher must be wincing.  She, at least, gets to sing "Over the Rainbow" in the closing credits, and affords herself adequately.  Jolie, sporting a sexy eye patch and form-fitting outfit, gets to make what amounts to an extended cameo.  Her English accent isn't too bad, though.<br /><br />And the credits do state that the estate of Sir Laurence Olivier did approve of his image and voice being used in the film.  Well, I know "Larry" is grimacing in his grave.<br /><br />When I saw the theatrical trailer for the film prior to its release, I wondered what were Law, Paltrow, and Jolie doing in a sci-fi epic.<br /><br />Now that I have viewed the entire film, I'm still wondering.<br /><br />I wonder do they still have the same agent, respectively.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>The only original point about 'Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow' is that: A) the entire film was made with CGIs, the cast being shot against the blue screen; so Empire State Building you see is just a trick of modern technology.<br /><br />And B) the film is virtually nothing but a homage to countless old films -- 'Metropolis,' 'The Third Man,' and many many others.  You may be absolutely enthralled, seeing the old-fashioned visuals refined and remodeled to the modern taste, or just unimpressed.  Sorry, but I belong to the latter category.<br /><br />The plot is silm (the film is basically an extention of 6 minute film the director made privately on his PC) -- so silm that in the second half it makes little sense.  It's about Sky Captain, intrepid pilot of fighter plane between the two world wars, and a newsreporter Polly Perkins, who seeks for the juicy story holding a camera.  They are involved with an international plot by one German scientist, and they come to know it soon after the city is under attack by many robots (ala 'The War of the World').<br /><br />Captain is played by Jude Law, Polly by Gwyneth Paltrow.  They look great on screen, like the stars of the 30s Hollywood, but don't expect any emotions, or chemstry, between them.  The film suggests they were formerly in love with each other, and will be again, but the lack of romantic feeling between the thin characters cannot be disguised.  And as supports, Giovanni Ribisi, Michael Gambon, Bai Ling (totally unrecognizable), and Angelina Jolie appear, but Ms. Jolie's role is just an extended cameo, just in case.<br /><br />In spite of interesting visuals, good costumes (by Stella McCartney, Paul's daughter), and rousing music, 'Sky Captain' remains the well-made sample of the director's flair for visuals.  The visuals themselves are good, I assure you, but the novelty soon wears off, and Kerry Conran still has many things to learn especially when it comes to inducing the actors to give their best shot.  In some scenes, the actors (Ms. Paltrow in particular) stares at somewhere in the air blankly, as if looking at nothing (of course, they are watching nothing in reality).<br /><br />Can he handle the humans as well as visuals?  Next time he will be tested, and until then, 'Sky Captain' remains a very good demo tape by a very promising director.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ.html">A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ</a><br/><p>I was actually looking forward to this film when it was released in the theaters.  I originally thought that the premise was original and creative.  Here, on my television, I was seeing images that I normally didn't associate with Hollywood.  Yea, it was big budget, yea it had these larger stars headlining the film (even a dead one), but I thought that perhaps it was one of those under-the-radar hits.  The critics hated it and it even fueled my desire to see it further.  There had to be something redeemable about this film.  Well, I finally had a chance to see it and I, sadly, will have to fence with the critics on this one.  This was an irritating, uncontrollable mess of a film that attempted to be original in every way possible, but instead found itself just being nothing more than a lump of cheap Hollywood mess complete with jumbled characters, a sloppy story, and finally even some overly dull CGI.  This was nothing that the advertisements promoted it would be.<br /><br />The CGI was the immediate draw for me into this film.  I was interested in seeing how director Kerry Conran would handle this feature with only the use of the blue/green screen.  With Lucas completely blowing down the door with modern technology, and the world of Hollywood at your fingertips, I thought that Conran would blow me out of the water.  Sadly, I found myself treading water for a couple of hours to follow.  The CGI seemed messy and fuzzy, blurred around the edges, I found myself squinting at the television and continually wondering what the glow was around each of our characters.  The darkened moments were too light, and the lighted moments were too dark.  It was as if Conran presented to us the rough draft of his project, instead of giving us a final, crisper draft.  I know that it was to represent an older generation and pay homage to that era that birthed the sci-fi genre, but in all honesty this was the black sheep of that generation and genre.  The green/blue screen was my biggest issue with this film.  It hurt my eyes to look at and took my appreciation away for any possibility of creativity and uniqueness.  It was sloppy, for lack of a better word, and I think Conran knew that from the beginning.<br /><br />I think that he knew that it wasn't going to be this crisp feature because he boasted some larger named stars to throttle this film even more.  If he would have focused, yet even promoted, this film on the green/blue screen uniqueness alone, perhaps he would have done a bit better with the critics and box office, but instead we had to be guided through this mess by actors that just couldn't seem to carry their own simple characters.  This was my second major issue for me with this film.  Here you have Jude Law, Oscar-winning Gwyneth Paltrow, and even Oscar-winning Angelina Jolie headlining your film and yet they cannot seem to grasp the characters that they have to portray.  These were simpleton characters that really didn't need to much to fuel them, just some good old fashioned acting, but sadly our friends who are being paid far more than me, just couldn't handle this task.  This shoddy acting caused the chemistry between Law and Paltrow to be as dead as a doornail.  I literally never felt as if these two cared in any way about each other.  It was just another Hollywood pairing that backfired horribly in everyone's faces.  I couldn't even tell if they liked each other as friends it was that poor.  Is it bad when you think that the only actor who seemed to carry their part decently well was Sir Lawrence Olivier?  I think it is bad when a dead actor upstages the best of Hollywood.  There is definitely something wrong with this picture.  This horrible, messy acting with apparent lack of chemistry drew my attention away from the green/blue screen long enough to completely sour my stomach again.  Perhaps the story will lend a better hand ...<br /><br />Wrong again friends.  The story was a classic "Who cares" moment where you witness your characters going through the motions, building the plot to bring us to a conclusion, but you find yourself really just saying "Who cares" throughout all of it.  The already poor use of actors and green/blue screen pushed too much pressure onto the story, which, like an employee on his first day of work, just crumbled under the stress.  There was honestly nothing valuable to the entire story that I can put in this review.  From the over-the-top introduction to the world and Sky Captain to the jumbled mess that was Angelina Jolie, to the final moments where I am sure PETA was up in arms. Even the ending line just forced that final breath of air out of you and made you more excited about returning this film.  It was shameful.<br /><br />Overall, nothing can be pulled and claimed as redeemable for this film.  I will say that the thought was creative, but sadly it was the creation process that ultimately failed this film.  From poor green/blue screen translation to stubble acting with a shoddy story, Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is everything the critics claimed and more.  I am not normally one that will take the critics sides, but this film just didn't work anywhere.  I do not suggest it to anyone, and in fact if you see a friend with it in their hands, go ahead and burn their hands off.  You would be doing them a favor and hopefully the infection will not spread.<br /><br />Grade: * out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A2I6MHMAZZDCRX.html">A2I6MHMAZZDCRX</a><br/><p>Its 1939 New York, and reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) finds herself caught up in a giant robot attack on the city.  But that's only the beginning.  It's part of an evil plot by German scientist Totenkopf to take over the world.  Reluctantly joining forces with Joe Sullivan, a.k.a Sky Captain (Jude Law), she sets out to discover and foil his plan.<br /><br />I heard great things about this movie before I saw it, comparing it to Indiana Jones and raving about the effects.  I'll gladly concede the movie looked great.  Using almost nothing but real actors and CGI settings, the movie is amazing.  It looks like it was filmed in the 30's or 40's, and easily evokes that feel.<br /><br />Unfortunately, looks aren't enough for this movie.  The plot is not the exciting storyline I was looking for, but rather boring and at times very hard to follow.  And the characters were hardly sympathetic.  This came to a head for me at the climax.  The heroes were in danger, but I couldn't bring myself to care if they made it out alive or not.<br /><br />I appear to be in the minority in this movie, but it was not the fun escapist ride I had hoped for.  Rent it before you buy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R8LZYZR3377O.html">A1R8LZYZR3377O</a><br/><p>I was looking foward to seeing this movie when I first saw the TV trailer(teaser).I saw a few more trailers and that reduced to me to a mild interest. When the dvd came out I was sorry I even spent one cent on the rental. The film desperatly reaches in some way to capture the classic image and storyline of a bygone era in filmmaking. It miserably fails. Waiting for it to end was about the extent of the suspense. Gwyneth Paltrows acting was horrendous. Her blank stare and rote lines left me bored beyond comprehension. Jude Law(Sky captain)should never be considered to play any role that even remotely resembles a robust action hero. He is best suited as maybe an icecream man in a lowbudget, British troubled teens film. Angelia Jolie, who was primarily used to sell this film in clips tries , but looks lost, yearning to yank off that eye patch. The story, which is hardly explainable(or worth it)is a convoluted, heaping pile of junk. The film backfired because in its attempt to simulate good old style cliffhangers with futuristic imagery, it actually copied the worst of the films it was trying to duplicate. The old look glow that was intended to enhance the retro feel bugged my eyes out. It is not meant for prolonged viewing. The film appeared very blurry at times because of this. I would have given the movie no stars, but this review system does not allow for that.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I9B4PSCDDWOO.html">A1I9B4PSCDDWOO</a><br/><p>This movie got all the looks but totally void of soul and substance. Strictly made for little kids or little kids at heart, the stardards are set pretty low here and I wondered what kind of a person would throw money away after they read this humble review.<br /><br />The special effects are pretty good, acting proves to be above par and since most of the film were shot in front of blue screen, I would say that the acting proves to be more decent then I expected. Anglina Jolie get one of the top billings although her part is quite limited. (She more like an Lara Croft in uniform.) I loved the two seat P-40 super duper fighter that become a submarine and flies forever. Its seem to be this movie version of the flying Batmobile!! The other leading actors, Gwenyth Paltow and Jude Law are likable but their characters have much substance and soul as stuff panda bears!<br /><br />Where the film failed lies in the actual plot and script. The plot is so thin that it probably won't even make it as a comic book story. The dialogue proves to be so lame that they won't even used it in the comic book!! I must respect both Paltow and Jude Law for saying some of their lines with such professionalism since its really required real acting to say some of the lamest lines with a straight face. It also pretty sad that some of the lines seem to be borrowed from other films. I kept thinking to myself during the film, "I think I heard this line before!!" The actors kept referring to "First World War", are they in the second during the movie??? (No, I don't think so but its a good example of such attention to detail this movie seem to lack - even for a science fiction movie.)<br /><br />While some of the previous reviewers called this a comic book on the movie screen, I would have to say that its less then a comic book and more like a children book overblown into a movie.<br /><br />Its without a doubt, this film got all the trappings of a bad movie. Smart characters doing dumb things just to advance the story. Silly humor spread out throughout the movie. This movie, overall, is a super lightweight science fiction flick with very few redeeming value. The appreciation level is basically along the sixth grade level. Probably make a great DVD babysitter in the future.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>If you like movies that are adventurous, original and go back to the glory days of film, then Sky Captain is for you.

If Disney had CGI at the time, the movie would have been a success.  This one is in the spirit of the old time movie serials and while the action wasn't over the top in many places it was a very good movie. I did like the fact that, as one of the reviewers put it, there was no modern profanity and nudity.  It'd be out of place in this perfect movie about a retro future that looks like it came straight out of the 1940's art deco era.  I wonder if Dave Stevens is promoting a new version of his character after watching this?</p></br><a href="../users/A16FUU8WW76QFY.html">A16FUU8WW76QFY</a><br/><p>I looked forward with great anticipation to seeing "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" after having read mostly glowing reviews from the critics.  Alas, I was disappointed in this film.  While it is beautiful to look at, "Sky Captain" has no soul.<br /><br />The storyline is mostly a conglomeration of movie serials and landmark films from the 1920s and 1930s, and there are many none-too-subtle homages to Metropolis, King Kong, Buck Rodgers, and even a small tip of the hat to Godzilla (one must look closely to see the latter).  There are also influences from 1950s films; the giant robots bear a striking resemblance to the machine from the film "Kronos", complete with antenna, circular radio waves and sound.<br /><br />The actors are of quality background, but something is missing in terms of chemistry between the two principals.  Sky Captain (Jude Law) flies around in a souped-up P-40 Warhawk fighter plane, and is joined in his adventures by Ace Reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyeth Paltrow).  Polly spends most of the film whining about this or that, and Paltrow seems a bit overwhelmed by all the bluescreens; perhaps this is because she has not worked in this kind of film before, while Law did extensive duty in an effects-loaded "A.I. Artificial Intelligence".  These two have worked together before (The Talented Mr. Ripley) with excellent results, but there is no real warmth between them in this film.  Angelina Jolie appears all too briefly as the British commander of a sort of flying aircraft carrier.<br /><br />The production design and extensive CGI effects are truly amazing, with art-deco elements throughout.  In this respect the film is a work of art, with film noir lighting even in what is supposed to be broad daylight.  One major glitch in the film in light of this is the fact that Polly takes photos in caves, deep shadows, etc. without any semblance of a flash-filmmakers who specialize in such things as lighting should certainly know better.<br /><br />Overall "Sky Captain" does have a unique look about it; I can't say I've seen a modern movie that captures the visual essence of the 1920/30s like this film does.  However, the plot is far too convoluted (simple plots being the basis of the old serials), and some of the actors seem overwhelmed by the CGI technology.  Their chops suffer somewhat as a result.  2 stars for technical achievment.</p></br><a href="../users/A1VQBHHXIKHIGS.html">A1VQBHHXIKHIGS</a><br/><p>The guy who lent me this said he liked its look.  I found its look extremely distracting because it gave me eye strain.  But if we cut through that, we find that, in fact, this movie sucks.  Well, I admit that I only watched 2 of its 20 (I think) segments.  It's a loving tribute to 30s radio sci-fi serials and 50s sci-fi TV, but I see no reason to pay tribute to either of those formats, because they're full of bad writing, bad acting, and bad science.  As was this movie.  Life's too short.  Go watch THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL.  This particular movie is strictly for stupid people.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EJYJC25OJVKK.html">A3EJYJC25OJVKK</a><br/><p>After hearing all of the anticipation and actually accepting the hype that surrounding the release of this movie to the theatres during the autumn of 2004, I could never get a chance to actually see it on the big screen and thus the movie passed me by for a long afterwards until I rented it on DVD. As painful as it is, I have to be honest with my opinion of "Sky Captain". This movie is completely disappointing in my book. I might not get a lot of support with my review but I stand my ground on this. This is certainly far from being the worst movie by any means so at least try not to view this review as smashing this movie to bits.<br /><br /> "Sky Captain" is lacking in good storyline and the entire movie meanders in so many directions that it ends up being confusing and hard to enjoy because of this ("Matrix Reloaded and Revolutions" suffers similarly but far less so). The the giant robots are outright ridiculous and almost made me laugh at the way they looked more like something that combined the cartoonish quality of "Inspector Gadget" (a great cartoon series) and some kind of Tomb Raiderish CGI figures. I could understand very much the idea focusing this during the end of the 1930s and early 1940s and such but a lot of the technology and many machines almost make it look like 2050 or 2105 (100 years after writing this review) yet somehow aircraft and other obsolete technology is transported through a time machine and dropped off in the far future. That's what this movie feels more like as opposed to a World War II era storyline.<br /><br /> The movie was indeed shot combing live action footage of the cast with all-CGI backgrounds and that is a very interesting new technique. I'm sorry but upon hearing how the special effects were `groundbreaking' I have to disagree with this. Some of the CGI effects are actually very good and are breathtaking in their visual appeal but for the most part, the special effects are actually quite blurry and make the movie difficult to watch. This is one of the things that killed this movie for me. I am all for CGI-effects even if they do get overblown but SKATWOT's special effects are just so overdone, so overproduced, to the point that it saps the quality out of it. The special effects in "Lord of The Rings" and even the Matrix trilogy (including the 1999 original) were far superior to the EFX in "Sky Caption". I did not see much of anything that looked revolutionary or groundbreaking in this movie. What could've been groundbreaking instead comes off as overdone and a grand waste of opportunity.<br /><br /> I'm not saying avoid this movie like the plague necessarily but do not expect anything out of the ordinary on this movie. A bitter and crushing disappointment to say the least, you're better off just passing this by.</p></br><a href="../users/ATU6AN7OFVO0M.html">ATU6AN7OFVO0M</a><br/><p>I've Ridden most of the reviews about this movie and I've got surprised cause I can't find even one positive point in this movie!

I may cause of that all of the scenes were computer graphic generated and actors couldn't feel later CG Environment around them<br /><br />2. Montaging Actors in CG environment was extremely poor and actors were not seem as a part of environment but but some prominent motion beings in front it!<br /><br />3. CGs were not sophisticated. nothing looked like natural and CGs inspired you to feel that you are watching a computer Game demo!<br /><br />4. Story was extremely Ridicolous with no facts! I felt that the director of this movie was a child with huge budget who wants to bring to reality his childish dreams and games! If this movie had made in 50s, It could be acceptable but nowadays with Fact seeking people and Computer generation youth, making such ridicolous movies can consider as an insult!<br /><br />5. I don't know what was the problem of directors with colors. this movie in full colors could be much more toloratable! It was not totally black and white and it was not in full color either!<br /><br />6. I was a Dissapointing advertise for fallen British empire! I Don't know what was wrong with America that they Decided to Stick that flying air strips to Britain! Everyone knows without america, British couldn't sustain German attacks! Now they want to pretend that britain was always strong with super powers! I hate British and hate British accent more! Seem the British accent of Jude Law was not enough cause my favorite actress Angelina Jolie was trying to pretent that she was a British officer!<br /><br />Don't let the trailer fools you! this movie even not worth to watch once. instead of it, I suggest you watching LXG, which has rather same storyline but 1000 times better than this freak!</p></br><a href="../users/AKT8TGIT6VVZ5.html">AKT8TGIT6VVZ5</a><br/><p>Unlike some of those who have already submitted reviews here at Amazon.com I have not yet seen the film, but having seen gushing commentary from Harry Knowles, the film and internet geek in charge of the "Ain't It Cool" website, I am starting to believe all the hype, since this film looks to be a spectacular achievement in both CGI and storytelling. It could be the most exciting fast-paced action adventure film since "Star Wars IV: A New Hope" or the original "Raiders of the Lost Ark", and these are apt comparisons, not mere hyperbole, since Kerry Conron's film is also, like "Star Wars" and "Raiders", an homage to the great "B" action adventure flicks from the 1930's with more than a passing nod to Errol Flynn's swashbuckling characters, in the form of the heroic Sky Captain, portayed by Jude Law, and of course to Harrison Ford's Han Solo and Indiana Jones.<br /><br />Set on the eve of World War II in an alternate reality version of the 1930's, "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" chronicles the exploits of daring New York journalist Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) as she uncovers clues and a trail pointing to those responsible for the disappearances of leading scientists worldwide. One of these clues lets her unexpectedly to cross paths with her ex-boyfriend, ace aviator Sky Captain, and together they join forces to solve these disappearances, defeat an army of gigantic robots bent on destroying New York City, and save the world from the evil Dr. Totenkopf. They are aided in their quest by a 1930's versions of William Gibson's cyberspace "console jockeys", Dax Dearborn (Giovanni Ribisi) and they also received asssitance Franky Cook (Angelina Jolie), yet another  former girlfirend of Sk Captain, now stationed as the comamnder of  a Britsh royal air force squadron in Nepal. And yes, judging from the lush style and gripping narrative of this film, it is probably not too much a stretch to make some comparisons of it with the classic cyberpunk film "Blade Runner" too. The film's lush romantic score pays homage to 1930's swashbuckler film scores and the work of film composers such as Korngold and Newman.<br /><br />Without a doubt, I am looking forward to seeing it when it does arrive on the big screen later this week. Kerry Conron's film may stand alongside Peter Jackson's "The Lords of The Rings" cinematic trilogy, as yet another of the great films of this decade so far, and maybe, of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A2FBIF1FKBC193.html">A2FBIF1FKBC193</a><br/><p>I mean it's much much worse than that ...Aftre watching this film I immediately called my optometrist for an appointment since everfything was very dalk and foggy .. my wife told me that no I'm not in pre glaucoma stages it's the artsy way the film was made ...<br /><br />Well you cant take artsy ... didn't it even dawn on the director that he sould maybe turn on SOME lights?<br /><br />If that wasn't bad enough the acting seemed very forced ..<br /><br />Do not kick out your hard earned cash to either buy or rent this dog!</p></br><a href="../users/A1N8K1X0OLLADY.html">A1N8K1X0OLLADY</a><br/><p>This is truly the most boring movie of 2004.

This film will easily wow you in its opening 10 minutes only to dissapoint you as it progresses. This is ultimately how it will be remembered.<br /><br />"Sky Captain..." is based on 30s-40s aesthetics and 50s sci-fi films and it aims to cash in on the nostalgia factor for the old classics. On a visual level it does extremely well. On an intellectual level it does poorly.<br /><br />  A plot that borders infantile conception cant possibly be compensated by the awe-inspiring visuals, CGIs, and great cinematography in general. The average western viewer has outgrown that.<br /><br />  The old and cliched storyline of an abstract bad guy threatening the world for abstract reasons doesnt wash any more. Not when the good guys are as mindless and simpletonic as the ones portrayed in this film, to the point where a choice as to whom to identify with could be decided through a coin toss.<br /><br />  On top of that, a plot with seriously insulting holes as the one here, only makes for further damage on the film's effectivity, especially when these inconsistencies are eye-poking at best and cant be ignored unless you're someone who could ignore stomping elephants in your living room.<br /><br />  And as for acting...Well...You cant possibly ask for acting when the actors barely have time to utter some trivial line in-between explosions and air-chases. A very competent actor like Jude Law goes pointlessly wasted in this flick. They could've hired anybody for such a low-expectations job and the the dent on people's reputation participating here would be avoided.<br /><br />  But among all this mess, there's the positives that i started of with:<br /><br />  the director has done a truly outstanding job capturing the feeling of 50s sci-fi. The fact that he's done it in a hollow manner is the other side of the coin. But he did do great in that sector. It's not only the clever usage of colour that achieved this, but also the carefully depicted "primitive" technology (seeing the hilarious giant robots will convince you of this. This doubled with some well inspired ideas realised by the CGI makes it an optical feast.<br /><br />  I'd go as far as say that if you watched this with the voice off you'll be alot more rewarded than otherwise. And less cerebrally insulted.<br /><br />  A definitely good try but certainly not worth the cigar.</p></br><a href="../users/AR37967IAR6ZT.html">AR37967IAR6ZT</a><br/><p>Writer-director Kerry Conran's debut feature "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" is both an amazing-looking modern technological feat and a darn entertaining throwback to old Hollywood serials. It's got so much in it that's cool to look at, first of all. And the plot, story and characters have so much pluck that the film wins you over.<br /><br />Thank goodness someone had the sense to finally make a live-action movie about giant killer robots invading New York. I was afraid they wouldn't make one in my lifetime.<br /><br />The story is told in old Hollywood comic-book style, where the hero always cares about his wacky sidekick way more than his girlfriend. The heroine's hair and makeup is always flawless - even though she's escaped from the giant robots, traveled across the globe (and underwater!) in her ex-boyfriend's plane, gotten trapped in a radioactive mine filled with dynamite AND tried to get the biggest scoop in her career as a reporter.<br /><br />Jude Law plays Joe Sullivan, also known as Sky Captain, the flying ace who heads his own private air battalion intent on protecting the world. Law gives Joe enough attitude and goofy charm to come off as a clean-shaven Errol Flynn in this movie.<br /><br />Gwyneth Paltrow, in the funniest and perhaps trickiest role in the movie, plays Polly Perkins, a reporter for the New York Observer who's not above putting her own life (but never her camera) at risk while tracking down an evil madman's plot to destroy the world. Polly, who's either brilliant or dumb-as-a-post depending upon the situation she's in, is also completely self-serving and manipulative. She whines too much, bugs Sky Captain too much, flirts too obviously and doesn't listen to anything anyone has to say. Because of this - and because she's following in the footsteps of her female-heroine ancestors like Fay Wray, her character is HILARIOUS.<br /><br />Many people might have a problem with Polly for this same reason. But, as Paltrow plays her, she's more than just face-value irritating. Paltrow plays her intentionally without irony, short of winking at the camera much of the time, but the joke of Polly Perkins and the running gag of her camera comes through in spades in the film.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie shows up briefly, but her part in the film is key. And her biggest scene provides the film with a great moment that had me and others applauding in the theater.<br /><br />As for the computer effects, they're awesome - even if they're at times obviously fake. That's partly the point, for the effects in the movies "Sky Captain" is paying homage to did the same thing. Still, the sepia-toned look of the entire film is a marvel.<br /><br />The movie just sweeps you up in its glee, and there are cliffhangers every 10 minutes - the likes of which I haven't seen since "Raiders of the Lost Ark." "Sky Captain" has mild language, good laughs and would work for the whole family.<br /><br />It's a very fun trip. I loved this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" is essentially a comic book in a movie format with a stupendous array of computer graphics but a somewhat thin plot.<br /><br />The movie begins with an awesome graphic of the dirigible Hindenburg docking atop the Empire State Building in a snowstorm in the 1930's.  A German scientist and sole survivor of a group of scientists involved in secret experiment after WW I in Berlin is a passenger.  He has some information to divulge and calls to meet with New York Chronicle reporter Polly Perkins, played nicely by the deco garbed Gwyneth Paltrow.  Soon after they meet the city is attacked by gigantic flying robots apparently searching for some generators located there.  Sky Captain Joe Sullivan played dashingly by Jude Law is summoned to save the day and damsel in distress Paltrow.<br /><br />Law is the leader of a mercenary air force and is aided by his second in command, mechanical genius Dex Dearborn played by the talented, entertaining and flaky Giovanni Ribisi.  Soon Law and Paltrow collaborate to solve the plot which involves the usual goal of world destruction.  They had learned that a brilliant German scientist Dr. Totenkopf, played by a computer generated Laurence Olivier, the creator of the secret experiment is behind the annihilation of the Earth with his army of robots.  Their investigation leads them to far reaching exotic worldwide locations.<br /><br />"Sky Captain" is an entertaining romp but it's never fully explained as to the motivation of Totenkopf to destroy the world.  The acting was decent with Paltrow and Ribisi leading the way.  Angelina Jolie playing Captain Franky Cook was ridiculous with her phony English accent and eye patch and added little to the plot.</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>When I first saw the previews earlier this year for SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW, I thought, "What a dumb looking movie."  A few months later, I saw a longer trailer and thought, "This looks interesting." I decided then I would see the film when it came out. A few days before the film's opening, I discovered that other than the actors, a few props, and some costumes, SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW was completely computer generated.  The movie would be worth seeing for that achievement alone.<br /><br />However, SKY CAPTAIN is worth seeing for far more than for the by-line it will receive in cinematic history.  The movie is a complete throwback to old action/adventure serials that used to be shown before the "A" picture would start.  The INDIANA JONES and STAR WARS films were all inspired by the same pictures. SKY CAPTAIN feels like those movies (cheesy lines and all), but influences from KING KONG, THE WIZARD OF OZ, the Island of Dr. Moreau, and Flash Gordon also have a prescence.<br /><br />SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW takes place in the year 1939. Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) is an ace reporter for the Chronicle newspaper. She receives a cryptic message from a top scientist about a cynical plan to destory the world.  Before she can find out more, the city is attacked by a huge army of giant robots (think evil IRON GIANTS).  Joe "Sky Captain" Sullivan (Jude Law) is called into action and saves Polly from being killed and the city from being totally destroyed.  "Sky Captain" has a special base outside of the city where he and his private army work at saving the world. Anyway, neither Joe or Polly can figure out what the robots wanted. Then Joe's base comes under attack as does New York. During the fight that assumes, Joe's best friend and genius designer, Dex Dearborn (played perfectly by Giovanni Ribisi) is kidnapped by the invading army. Thus begins a chase over halfway around the world to rescue Dex and uncover what in the world is going on.  Add some mutated animals, a few dinosaurs, and a flying aircraft carrier and you've got The World of Tomorrow.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW.  George Lucas and Stephen Spielberg knew that audiences loved those types of movies, that's one of the reasons STAR WARS and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK were such huge blockbusters.  Many people have become way to cynical in their movie watching. Some movies entertain, some educate, and the best do both.  SKY CAPTAIN isn't meant to be a film to instruct the masses and change the world. Instead, it's a huge piece of mind candy that more than satisfies. Of course, the technological wonder that the film is could change the filmmaking world, much in the same way that STAR WARS did over 25 years ago.  There were a lot of STAR WARS imitators and I'm sure there will be many SKY CAPTAIN wannabes, too.  Whatever the case, I left the theatre wanting more and actually excited at the prospect that there could possibly be a sequel. So, put the cynicism away, sit back, relax, and enjoy this wonderful world of tomorrow. It'll make you forget about today (at least for 2 hours).</p></br><a href="../users/AUEHG0DB54B7K.html">AUEHG0DB54B7K</a><br/><p>Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is a movie that one loves or hates.  The story is a mixture of detective story and science fiction, the kind of story that was made into serials of the 1930's and 40's.  Intrepid newspaper report Polly Perkins (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) is hard after a story that leads her to a mysterious scientist named Totenkopf (or Dead Head).  The Sky Captain of the title is a flying ace named Joe Sullivan (Jude Law) who has the benefit of using space-age technology (from a plane that doubles as a submarine to a ray gun) invented by his sidekick Dex (played by Giovanni Ribisi).  Totenkopf is also quite an inventor and has a fleet of flying robots invade New York early in the film. Of course, Polly Perkins and Joe Sullivan have a past and their arguments make them seem like a married couple.  Angelina Jolie makes a brief appearance as Frankie, who commands a hovering aircraft carrier.  The futuristic inventions give the movie an interesting twist since we don't know what to expect next.<br /><br />The big difference with this film is that it was almost entirely computer generated.  The city streets, cars, buildings etc. were created by computer effects.  If I had not known how it was made I might have guessed that the film had gone through a colorizing process: the colors tend to be shades of grey with washed-out flesh tones.  The eye does become accustomed to the look of the film and the muted colors add much to the overall atmosphere.  All of the CGI effects allowed the file creator Kerry Conan (somebody who truly wore all kinds of hats in this production) to do some fantastic effects.  The opening scenes showing the docking of a German blimp is nicely done and the robot effects were fabulous, particularly the scene where Gwyneth Paltrow is trying to get a picture of the robots and avoid getting stepped on.<br /><br />The DVD extras include an interesting "making of" feature that included interviews and gave an excellent idea of how the concept of this film was born.  One gets an appreciation of all of the work that went into the effects and the difficulty the actors overcame by having nothing but a blue screen to react to. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow may not be what some critics would call a movie with a message but is pure entertainment, reaching back to old serials and sci-fi movies to make something visually stunning and nicely acted.  It holds your interest much like Raiders of the Lost Ark which has an equally fantastic story and improbabilities.  Just sit back and enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ.html">A1GPGBHBI6T2HJ</a><br/><p>Yeah, I can't recall why I missed seeing Sky Captain in the theaters when it first came out, and after waiting to rent it, I can safely say I made the right decision.  As Sky Captain began, I had the distinct feeling I had walked into the movie 10 minutes after it had already started.  The Director wastes no time whatsoever in explaining absolutely anything regarding the plot, what year it is and most importantly, why nobody seems to question the sudden, unexpected arrival of Super Gigantic flying robots in New York.<br /><br />While this bothered me on the outside, I was completely amazed at how visually stunning the movie was.  I was upset that any kind of set-up had been totally ignored, but I was also intrigued by what I was seeing.  There was plenty in the way of special effects, and I can see they spent more on them than they did plot development -- or even description OF the plot in general.  Why does the Sky Captain's genius inventor have access to what looks to be a ray gun?  How is it the plane he flies also has the ability to turn into a submarine as well?  Sure, I realize to accept certain movies with a fantasy/sci-fi element to it you must suspend your belief -- but usually SOME kind of explanation is given or is already apparent at the film opening.  Not here.  My questions is WHY?  It could have made the movie much more interesting and quite a bit more entertaining.  Are we dealing with an alternate past where science has grown by leaps and bounds but the rest of the world is trapped in 1939?  I wish I had the answers to these questions, but I don't.<br /><br />When all is said and done, IF I had known about some of the films problems before starting it, I honestly believe I would have enjoyed it more.  In fact, I believe I would recommend the movie for sci-fi buffs, along with a pre-explanation of a few things first.  As for the visuals in the film, they were first rate.  The cinematographer captured the essence of the late 30's and early 40's with perfect accuracy -- at least they did in MY eyes...however, the plot and so many unexplained details made an otherwise enjoyable experience fall slightly flat.</p></br><a href="../users/ABSX5TGEGRH76.html">ABSX5TGEGRH76</a><br/><p>It's a shame that this movie didn't do so well, as it was a pretty cool movie.  It didn't even recoup half of what it cost to make, and judging by the amazing effects this movie had, I'm guessing that it was pretty expensive.  I blame marketing; I cannot remember ever wanting to see it until after it was released on DVD, and people I know and online reviewers told me to go see it.<br /><br />In New York City, circa 1939 (albeit, an alternate timeline 1939), reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) has been investigating a group of scientists who have been mysteriously disappearing.  All of them have been linked to a pre-WWI project based out of Berlin and led by a mysterious man named Totenkopf.  Soon after meeting with the 7th scientist, a legion of giant robots begin attacking the city, and only Joseph "Sky Captain" Sullivan (Jude Law) can save the day.  After he barely fights off the bots, the mechanical menaces receive a radio signal that Sky Captain's assistant, Dex Dearborn (Giovanni Ribisi) begins to trace.  Dex is kind of like the Q to Sky Captain's James Bond; he makes gadgets and modifications to the planes used by Sky Captain and his "army for hire".<br /><br />Soon, Polly and Sky Captain begin a journey to find Totenkopf and discover why he has been sending his robots to destroy major cities (New York wasn't the only target).  Along the way, they meet up with Sky Captain's old friend Francesca "Franky" Cook (Angelina Jolie), a Royal Navy commander with one of the coolest air fleets ever to appear on film (although her role is more of a cameo than a featured one, as the trailers and box art would have you believe).<br /><br />If I could, I guess I would give this movie 4 and 1/2 stars instead of 5, but since I can't I feel that it deserves the 5 rather than the 4.  I can kind of see why some people didn't like this movie; there were some lapses in logic, and some of the situations seem kind of dated.  What the naysayers don't understand is, that was kind of the point.  This movie is a homage to old 1940's and 50's era comics and adventure stories.  One could almost call this "Indiana Jones meets Star Wars" (which I think the director really was going for, since there is a George Lucas reference on one of the scientist's doors).  This film isn't about winning Oscars (except maybe in the visual effects categories), it's about retro fun.  It's about paying respect to classic filmmaking that we really don't get to see anymore.  This is a must-see for any Lucas/Speilberg fan, and I would really reccomend it to anyone.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>An anonymous note brings Polly Perkins, ace woman reporter, to Radio City Music Hall to watch "Wizard of Oz."  An elderly gentlemen comes to her and tells her that he has information on the scientists who are disappearing.  Before his precipitous departure he tells her he's the next scientist to disappear and when she asks who's doing this, the one-word reply is Totemkopf.<br /><br />Next thing you know, a machine driven blitzkrieg hits NYC.  Mercenary "SSky Captain" (Jude Law) is flying over the city doing his best to kill the invading enemy machines.<br /><br />Perkins and Joe team up to solve both of the cases.  There's a lot of romentic and comedic tension between the two.  They used to be an 'item' til she caught him cheating on her and messed with his plane's fuel line.<br /><br />The effects are stunning.  The pellucid colors remind me of a vintage comic--or an old photo colored with Marshal oils.  The scenery is pretty amazing and the action good enough to keep you riveted in your seat for most of the show.<br /><br />True, the performance is not up to the actor's standard, but this is not a drama.<br /><br />The running plot about Paltrow and her camera was one of the funniest bits in the movie.  I can so relate to her problems with taking pictures.<br /><br />Overall, a very worthwhile film to own and watch again.</p></br><a href="../users/A11ED8O95W2103.html">A11ED8O95W2103</a><br/><p>This film got mixed reviews upon release back in '04 and I finally got around to seeing it last night when I plopped it in my DVD player and played it through the little flatscreen unit next to my treadmill.<br /><br />I had no expectations at all so I was pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable this movie was.  I expected something like a 1930's Flash Gordon type cliff hanger, and it was very much like that.<br /><br />The visuals are beautiful; the story moves briskly along but the plot is sufficiently developed given the kind of movie it is.  I loved the gadgets!  The music was completely appropriate and enjoyable and fit the retro cliff hanger atmosphere.  I could tell a lot of work went into this movie.<br /><br />And, guess what?  The actors could actually act!  I didn't think they acted quite as well as they could have, but it must have been difficult since probably much of their acting was done in front of a blue screen.  They must have had to imagine what many of the scenes were going to end up looking like.  So, I deducted one star due to the fact that we had accomplished actors very obviously (to me anyway) not doing their best work.  They seemed way to relaxed way too much of the time considering the danger they were surrounded by for much of the story.<br /><br />So, it's a fun film, and a great way to walk away 400 calories.<br /><br />Postscript:  Bonus features are neat!  There is a multi-part documentary on the making of the movie which is an interesting and inspiring story in and of itself.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WX1UESDOLXRE.html">A2WX1UESDOLXRE</a><br/><p>I'll admit, my expectations were low. I had seen the previews and kept thinking, "Why does it look all blurry?" Jude Law and Gwyneth Patlrow convinced me to go. I absolutely love this movie. Everything about it. The completely original characters, that slightly blurry way it was filmed that reminds me of old photographs from the 40s of my grandparents, the costumes, the story, it's all unbelievable! And I mean that in a good way!<br /><br />The movie is about Joe Sullivan (Law) aka Sky Captain and the perky Polly Perkins (Paltrow). Scientists have been disappearing, and Polly is a reporter trying to figure it all out. One day, giant flying robots (it sounds hokey, but just go with it!) land in the city, stealing from power plants to get "supplies." Sky Captain is recruited to find out why and who is behind the operation and Polly, his ex-girlfriend, demands clearance because she knows some things about the mystery that he doesn't know. So the movie goes on, in this totally amazing world with characters you are going to love.<br /><br />There's lots to love about this movie. The cool story, the cool effects, Jude Law... okay, Gwyneth too! They make an awesome pairing (yet again--- they were in The Talented Mr. Ripley together) and their snippy banter is wonderful. I was laughing out loud during some moments that I despertely want to give away right now so you can have a laugh-- but I'm going to keep them to myself and hopefully you'll jet to the theater to check this one out. Giovanni Ribisi and Angelina Jolie also make appearances, Jolie's name even appears with Paltrow and Law's names before the title in the credits, but it's Ribisi's name that should've been there. He's fantastic, I can't wait to see more of him in Flight of the Phoenix out this November.<br /><br />Think it looks stupid? Hokey? Seen it before? Guess again! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX.html">A1MJMYLRTZ76ZX</a><br/><p>Sky Captain is a beautifully designed and convincingly rendered movie based on the stylistic concepts of the early Golden Age of Science Fiction, which started in the 30s and ended in the 60s with the arrival of the so-called New Wave. Much of the visual style owes its inspiration to the work of several architects and designers of the period. Huge Ferriss, an architect, drew beautiful charcoal drawings and portraits of a futuristic, high-rise New York that were very popular and appeared as illustrations in many important magazines of the day. Two other influences that were significant were Norman Bel Geddes, an industrial designer, and Raymond Loewy.<br /><br />The flying platform in the movie derives from one of Bel Geddes's most ambitious concepts, a nine story high amphibious airliner that incorporated open recreation areas, space for a symphony orchestra, two airplane hangers, a gymnasium and a solarium. Loewy is remembered for designs that have influenced almost every aspect of American life, including Air Force One, NASA's Skylab space station, Frigidaire freezers, washers, and ovens, the redesign of the original Coke Bottle, the Lucky Strike cigaret package, many diesel locomotive designs, Studebaker automobiles, and the Greyhound Scenicruiser bus, to mention some of his most important projects.<br /><br />The streamlined art deco design of the period owes a great deal to the work of these three men, and was the reason that everything from cars to Buck Rogers's rocket ship had the same look. The film brilliantly recaptures the zeitgeist and overall look and feel of this period of the Golden Age. I think the film is worth seeing if only for that. But the special effects and action are also great and make this a fun movie to see even if you're not a fan of Art Deco architecture and the old Sci-Fi pulp magazines.</p></br><a href="../users/A33XHXRTRZOQ12.html">A33XHXRTRZOQ12</a><br/><p>Someone does something INNOVATIVE in movies! Just imagine...those great Alex Raymond-drawn Flash Gordon strips of the forties and thirties come to life in full art deco regalia, aesthetics absolutely perfectly replicated in 3 dimensions, with the perfect casting of Gwyneth Paltrow as a Lois Lane-type reporter, Giovannia Ribisi as Mr. Gadgets and Mr. Matinee Idol himself, Jude Law, as the hero, and you have "Sky Captain & The World of Tomorrow"...a film I KNEW was going to be groundbreaking when it was in the promo stage.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie that is a perfect marriage of major league visuals and suitable acting, and, "Gladiator" aside, is the one film that makes PERFECT use of CGI technology! The entire film was done against a bluescreen, with very few real-world props! There have been other reviews of this film decrying the wooden acting of those involved, but you have to remember that 1) Acting WITH real-world references isn't easy, and 2) These actors were doing their thing WITHOUT real-world references, something I've always appreciated about a good sci-fi or fantasy movie...<br /><br />The story concerns the classic megalomaniacal villain scenario of a mad, but brilliant scientist who has misused his gift to satisfy his own outsized paranoia. Laurence Olivier is digitally resurrected to play the computer generated persona of this man, a Dr. "Totenkopf", (done VERY "Wizard of Oz",) who has gone about sending his mechanical minions to sap energy from large cities whilst destroying same to build an ark that will preserve life and humanity offworld as the Earth descends into mayhem that he is at least partially responsible for.<br /><br />To say that the visuals are mind-boggling would be an understatement....the visuals are easily the equal of any of the earlier "Star Wars" films and the last fifteen minutes of the film are worth the price of admission. Jude Law is a capable hero as Sky Captain Joe Sullivan, but it's Gwyneth Paltrow as Polly Perkins, a blonde xeroxing of good old Lois Lane, that steals the movie from him! She makes all the mistakes a normal person would make in the movie...inadvertently giving away their presence when they try to stealthily sabotage Totenkopf's lair; not having enough film to capture some of the most incredible, newsworthy tableau a journalist has ever laid eyes on, and doing some of the worst backseat driving since Lucille Ball! The banter between her and Sullivan is straight out of a Bogart and Bacall movie.<br /><br />Some of the actors in the film that portray the scientists that Totenkopf is either killing off or forcing to work for him from the grave, (he managed to infuse his persona in his vast array of computer and broadcasting circuits at his lair,) are truly convincing as meek, put-upon scientists running for their lives from a supposedly dead madman. However, they seem to be very self-involved about it, not really caring that the world at large is in danger as well.<br /><br />Complex and entertaining, "Sky Captain" was perhaps the most underrated film of 2004, and the only one I saw fit to see in the theater. You better believe I had to have it on DVD....!<br /><br />The ending is very cute, btw.<br /><br />By all means, GET IT!</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is a film bound to polarize audiences and critics alike. Loving homage or blatant rip-off? It really depends on whether you love or hate this movie. Personally, I was transported away to this cinematic dreamland for the entire running time. Kerry Conran's labour of love is an unabashed tribute to the old pulp serials of the `20s and `30s (Doc Savage, Flash Gordon, etc.). It succeeds where previous pulp serial homages of the `90s failed (The Shadow, The Phantom, Dick Tracy). Like those films, Sky Captain successfully captures the look and feel of these vintage serials but, most importantly, it also stays true to their spirit-something that these other movies failed to do (The Rocketeer as the lone exception).<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by producer Jon Avnet. Avnet takes us through the filmmaking process in an engaging way that is also very informative. He talks quite eloquently about his role-how he allowed Conran to realize his vision but on a large budget-and mentored by him.<br /><br />Also included is another commentary track with Conran, his brother and the film's production designer Kevin Conran, animation supervisor Steve Yamamoto and visual effects supervisor Darin Hollings. Students of special effects will enjoy this informative commentary.<br /><br />"Brave New World: Chapter 1 and 2" are two making of featurettes that provide a fascinating look at how this production came together. These docs are refreshingly free of an excess of clips from the movie and a slick, over-produced look that resembles a commercial in favour of a more substantial look at how this film was made.<br /><br />"The Art of the World of Tomorrow" is hosted by Kevin Conran who describes the movie as "a comic book come to life." Among other things, he talks about the art and architecture that inspired their vision of New York City. It is interesting to see the sources that they drew upon for their distinctive cinematic world.<br /><br />"The Original Six Minute Short" allows you to look at what Conran made, pretty much on his own over several years, that would go on to impress people like Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow-enough that they would sign on to do the movie without even looking at a script.<br /><br />There are two deleted scenes, including a good scene where Dex rescues Joe and Polly from a cage, complete with unfinished effects.<br /><br />Finally, there is a two-and-a-half minute "Gag Reel" of blown lines and general goofing around on the set.<br /><br />Sky Captain has all the markings of a debut by a first-time filmmaker. There is a go-for-broke, let's-cram-everything-in-this-one attitude that a first-timer has a tendency to adopt because they don't know if there are going to get another chance. Sadly, Sky Captain failed at the box office thus insuring the unlikely prospects of a sequel. It's too bad because it presents a richly textured and detailed world with fun and exciting characters.</p></br><a href="../users/AURZ4YQ270W3T.html">AURZ4YQ270W3T</a><br/><p>"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" is a visual treat, the kind of film that advances the visual state of the art, and it's a blast. But, as other films that also advanced the state of the art remind us  - "Fantastic Voyage," "Earthquake," "Logan's Run," "Tron," and even "Final Fantasy" come to mind - it takes more than cool visuals to make a truly great movie.<br /><br />What it takes is emotional resonance, and that's what "Sky Captain" lacks. Emotional resonance is the reason why films like "The Wizard of Oz," "Star Wars," and "Raiders of the Lost Ark"  - all of which are obvious influences here - are still great, even after the state of the visual art passed them by. In those classic films, the human element shines through the technology; in "Sky Captain," the humanity seems a bit lost.<br /><br />Not that "Sky Captain" doesn't try, with terrific actors, and some frequently fun and snappy dialogue. Perhaps it's no coincidence that the most recent "Star Wars" movies, which, like "Sky Captain," were all largely shot in front of green screens and had the environments "digitized," also don't make much of an emotional impact either. Perhaps actors are more "real" in a "real" environment.<br /><br />But "Sky Captain" has its moments, from the gorgeous rendition of 1930's New York, to wildly imaginitive visual elements like bombers with wings that flap like a bird's, to giant airships that serve as floating airbases. This is all truly visionary stuff, and it's executed with real panache, but it's done without making a real emotional connection with the audience.<br /><br />You have to give the director, Kerry Conran, props for visual originality, and for the way this film was brought to the big screen (hey, there's hope for all us frustrated filmmakers, I guess), and hope that his next effort will make that next great leap into a film with real emotional impact. Conran has that kind of film in him, if Hollywood will give him another shot.</p></br><a href="../users/A25ACLV5KPB4W.html">A25ACLV5KPB4W</a><br/><p>It's a world when tomorrow held promises of a bright future. Urban America, 1920 or so, and technology has managed to surpass the technology of 2004 in some ways, but is still charmingly cloaked in the clunky nuts and bolts of Rosie the Riveter. There's a comic book feel as giant robots invade the city, and Jude Law appears in a single-man plane to repel them with machine-gun fire. The plot unfolds to encompass more of the world, and eventually we learn that an evil scientist is gathering animals into a noah's ark, so that he can destroy the earth and make a paradise among the stars. The movie looks cool, with a soft lens filming technique and an all-CGI background that combine to give us a unique feel. But the plot is silly even in the rare instances when it is believable, and the screenplay can't give us any more than a caricature of the era. It succeeds on an "Indiana Jones" kind of level, but I wanted more cleverness to be inserted into both the dialogue and the plot to accompany the technical wizardry.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AMVA4R3G58TV.html">A1AMVA4R3G58TV</a><br/><p>Sky Captain and The World of Tomorrow is a beautiful science fiction movie.

The film itself takes you back in time, and the special effects are amazing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2SRZQU1SZG4RR.html">A2SRZQU1SZG4RR</a><br/><p>This film is an interesting mix of pre-World War II characters, reminding the viewer of entertaining cartoon-like creations. It has futuristic high tech science blended with the menace and threat of an evil scientist who is bent on destroying the world as we know it. The primary settings are: a huge city, very much like New York ... a distant unnamed island where on-going research is done by the "good guys" who have captured the giant "robots" which arrive unexpectedly and threaten the population. Later the Sky Captain and Polly Perkins the reporter explore the Himalayas specifically Shambala or Shangri-La ... because of a secret map which Polly obtained ... and due to hints left by Dexter, one of the 'good guy' researchers. They are at some point rescued by "Frankie" who it turns out is an ace pilot. Angelie Jolie very adeptly plays Frankie who is really "Franceska" ...<br /><br />Polly Perkins (Gweneth Paltrow) is a highly engaging news reporter who takes great risks to get the "scoop" of a lifetime. She couragously tracks the giant robots to write the first newspaper story about this major threat facing the population of the city. She receives a phone call to meet a scientist at the theater. He hints of secret experiments which occurred somewhere in Germany done by a scientist which are similar to the high tech threats facing the city. The good scientist disappears ... she fears he is murdered for "knowing too much" and passing it on to her. Before he died, he entrusted her with some valuable documents ... their value becomes known only later after Polly combines her efforts with the Sky Captain. The Sky Captain (played by Jude Law) zooms into view while the giant robots roam the city destroying whatever is in their path ... He flys adroitly between them, among them, adn between sky scrapers and buildings ... risking his life to discover what signals make them work. Eventually, he and Polly exchange information and reluctantly become allies in searching for the truth which lies behind the baffling robotic life-threatening menace. They have a history together ... were considered a romantic item ... but do not entirely trust each other due to some perceived let downs by each. One or the other generally holds back vital information even as they pair up to seek the truth ... It is clear from their exchanges that the film will be enjoyable and sparkling. The energy dynamics of the personalities of the characters are magnetic ... The film promises to be entertaining by the eclectic mix of unique settings, creative use of sci-fi, and the unique and complex plot that unfolds. At times there is a Matrix-like feel to the film ... the Tibetan scenes are well done. This viewer was entertained from beginning to end by the odd twists and turns of the plot which led to a climax and explosive conclusion.

The important twist is that it's a science fiction pulp film, which has long since fallen out of favor in an era of special effects and complicated scientific explanations. In sci-fi pulp, giant robots look like wind-up toys (actually, wind-up toys were supposed to look like giant robots), ray guns go "PEW! PEW!" and advanced technology doesn't require a lot of explaining. In pulp, there's non-stop action, the heroes are ridiculously well rounded, and a World War looms around the corner.<br /><br />And oh yeah, dinosaurs. You can't forget the dinosaurs.<br /><br />Sky Captain begins with the majestic view of a gigantic dirigible docking with the Empire State Building, and we know immediately that this is not the 1930s pre-World War II movie we're accustomed to. It is literally the World of Tomorrow, the kind featured at World's Fairs-utterly unrealistic and colored by the biases of the time. Thus, instead of planes ruling the air, we have massive blimps. Indeed, the zeppelin we see is titled "Hindenburg III." Presumably, the Hindenburg disaster did not take place in this future. This is the retro-futuristic era of the recent Batman cartoon and The Rocketeer, where dirigibles also rule the skies.<br /><br />Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow), an intrepid reporter who always gets her story. She's like the Lois Lane of the 1930s. She receives a desperate message from a hunted scientist. The inimitable Dr. Totenkopf, played by none other than Laurence Olivier, is chasing him. Yes, THAT Laurence Olivier. The fact that the few scenes of the "bad guy" are actually digitally inserted footage of a man who has been dead for 15 years carries a certain resonance, given the inevitable plot twist at the end of the movie.<br /><br />As Polly struggles to unveil the mystery of just who Totenkopf is, she meets her mysterious contact at Radio City Music Hall. What's playing? The Wizard of Oz, of course (another plot hint). And then just as this movie appears to be a film-noir rather than a pulp action film...<br /><br />GIANT ROBOTS ATTACK!<br /><br />That's right. Giant frickin' robots. I haven't enjoyed giant robots this much since the Iron Giant. They drop from the skies a fashion similar to the villains from the old Superman cartoons. Or, if you've never seen those, the animated footage used to demonstrate the potential of flying Nazi invaders in The Rocketeer. Their single eye is Gort-like (from the Day the Earth Stood Still), vaporizing the ineffectual police who fire at the five-story robots with their pistols. And yes, the eye rays make the PEW-PEW-PEW sound.<br /><br />Enter our hero, the Sky Captain, Joe Sullivan (Jude Law). Apparently, zeppelins didn't completely overtake the skies because Sky Captain flies a fighter plane that's a bit like a James Bond vehicle. It can shoot missiles, whip around corners with grappling hooks (a nod to Batman), fly underwater, and drop magnetic bombs. Joe, in traditional pulp fashion, is absurdly well rounded: he is an incredible shot, a fantastic pilot, and is well versed in ancient astronomy.<br /><br />But what do the robots want? They want our generators, our fuel supplies, and two samples of every living being on the planet. Why? Well, for the World of Tomorrow of course.<br /><br />The plot gradually unfolds as the rocky relationship between Polly and Joe is revealed. Joe accuses her of sabotaging his plane, Polly accuses him of fooling around. They have a love/hate relationship that ranges from comedic to sincere. The two agree to team up after a mysterious female assassin (who shoots rays out of her hands and can leap file cabinets in a single bound) kills the remaining scientist.<br /><br />Back at his not-so-secret base, Joe plots how to track the robot attackers to their home base with his resident Q-character, Dex Dearborn (Giovanni Ribisi). Dex manages to invent a gun that makes PEW-PEW-PEW sounds; it has a fin on top and everything, as if it were right out of a Flash Gordon movie. Then, while Polly and Joe discuss their next plans...<br /><br />GIANT ROBOTS ATTACK!<br /><br />Dex is captured, but not before leaving behind a clue as to the whereabouts of the robots home base. Joe and Polly fly off on a whirlwind adventure that will take them to Shangri-La, underwater, and to an island filled with dinosaurs. Giant frickin' dinosaurs!<br /><br />The entire film is shot through a fuzzy, washed out lens that gives it the feel of an old movie or a pulp comic book. Architecture is art deco. The robots are strange, one-eyed impractical things with joints in all the wrong places, just like the covers of a thousand science fiction novels. And all of it is done through the miracle of CGI.<br /><br />There's not too much for the characters to say, because this is a pulp film after all. Polly's there primarily to look pretty and occasionally punch a bad guy (or good guy) in the face. Joe swaggers and shoots things. And Dex is the anointed spouter of pseudoscientific mumbo jumbo.<br /><br />Despite the special effects, Sky Captain retains its sense of humor. And whenever things get boring...<br /><br />GIANT ROBOTS ATTACK!<br /><br />This is a true rollicking retro sci-fi pulp film, in the tradition of The Rocketeer, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Van Helsing, and The Iron Giant. Fans of older science fiction films will thoroughly enjoy themselves. Everyone else will probably just get a headache.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>This is my kind of movie. Pure imagination driven, action/adventure fun. It couldn't have been any better in my opinion.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>Really: is there anything so wonderful in all the world as Deadly Giant Robots?<br /><br />If you're like me, the answer is: NO! Giant Robots are the cat's pyjamas, any day of the week. And you'll find them in spades, and in all shapes and sizes, in the brilliantly retro "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow", among other joys, dark and light.<br /><br />Lightest of all is the artistry with which first-time director Kerry Conran (happily tinkering away on "John Carter of Mars") and effects/cinematography chief Eric Adkins and Mike Navarro have crafted this visual feast, which is so seamless, and harkens back so powerfully and nostalgically to the 1930's Golden Age of Cinema, that "Sky Captain" demands nothing less than to be seen in a gilded movie palace.<br /><br />If that can't be arranged, you're still in for a treat. You've got plummy Gwyneth Paltrow playing the plummier Polly Perkins, saving that single exposure for the shot of the century while evading Giant Killer Robots on Park Avenue.<br /><br />You've got the mostly bland but spit-and-polish swashbuckling of Jude Law (Sky Captain himself), dogfighting with Deadly Giant Flying Robots in his P-51 and keeping that scarf flying back over his shoulder.<br /><br />You've got Angelina Jolie as the airborne black widow spider of the piece (and femme fatale, natch) Captain "Franky" Cook. Piloting the huge, lumbering sky carriers and well-armed attack submersibles, kitted out in a form-fitting black uniform complete with peaked cap and jackboots.<br /><br />Oh, and she's got an eyepatch. Oh, yes.<br /><br />If that's not enough to sell you alone, you've got a race against the clock to locate the mysterious Doctor Totenkopf (Lawrence Olivier brought back from the Dead through the alchemy and black magic of high technology!) in his secret lair, before he can destroy the planet with his rampaging army of Deadly Giant Robots! And who can resist something that pulpy, to say nothing of something this gorgeous?<br /><br />To round off the festitivites, you get the shadowy evil operative Lai Bing (who fights as stylishly as she dresses), dinosaurs, death ray beams, and the Hindenburg docking on the Empire State Builiding (a scene that is almost painfully beautiful) and even huge guardian Robots with cyclopean attack lasers and wavy tentacles, and fiendish plots to kidnap scientists, and...<br /><br />Well, you get the idea. It's like being 9 years old all over again.<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/A2B7BUH8834Y6M.html">A2B7BUH8834Y6M</a><br/><p>I was surprised how much I enjoyed this visual feast of a film. The timeframe is 1939-1940 - we know this because we see Polly Parker (Gwenyth Paltrow) viewing "The Wizard of Oz" on the big screen at Radio City Music Hall. She is a sassy professional journalist and amateur photographer in a mostly male-dominated workforce... but it's war time and no one is arguing.<br /><br />The film has almost a dream-like quality of old silver-gum prints that have then been hand-colored. You must see it to appreciate it. Every frame is like the saucy 1940 serials with Art Deco robots and technology.<br /><br />The robots look like Metropolis meets Gort - very artsy-fartsy, yet very ominous at the same time. These are giant 15-story-tall robots, some can fly, and they attack the city, tearing up buildings and streets, leaving with steel and generators, leaving the war-torn nations of the world without materials. No one knows who is behind this until they call Sky Captain (Jude Law) who has his own incredible James Bond-esque plane that can swim under water as well as fly. He and Polly end up trotting across the world, searching for the source of the robots. This same enigma is obviously also behind the disappearance of several of the world's most renowned scientists and no one knows if it's the Russians, the Germans, the Japanese or just some nut that's behind it.<br /><br />Thanks to two lewd comments and constant referral to a supposed incident of cheating on the Sky Captain's part when he was once dating Polly, the innocent, time-capsule quality of the film is lost. If just these few little scenes were snipped (all adding up to about 45 seconds), the film would be a timeless classic. I don't want to give up the plot of the film, but it's an interesting sci-fi genre from the time in which it emulates.<br /><br />This film is an epic achievement on a grand scale and a feast for the eyes and the nostalgic. I highly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A35L2E8M7S59MQ.html">A35L2E8M7S59MQ</a><br/><p>"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" is loud, noisy, silly, unbelievably ridiculous, and it's one of the most fun experiences I've had watching a movie in the past six months!  This is a movie that whisks the audience off into a long forgotten era of filmmaking that I for one am grateful to see it put back on screen with the advancements of today's technology.  I was just amazed that anyone would actually have the nerve to go back into the realm of camp, and cheese of the old shows and actually try and take it seriously (I don't mean the actual movie, for it is very tongue-in-cheek).<br /><br />This is fun for the entire family; the action will entertain children and the visuals will entertain older audiences, especially ones who are fans of old movies and serials.  This movie has lots to offer as popcorn entertainment, and I was entertained throughout.  I loved the way New York City looked, and I loved their jungle homage to the original "King Kong" towards the end of the film.  This film just is all visuals, and for the most part they're all good, and I never once felt the film overstayed its welcome.<br /><br />The movie is set between World Wars I and II (though the advanced technology won't have you believing that for a second) and starts off with a story about scientists who have started to mysteriously disappear.  Soon we find New York City under siege by giant robots that fly into action with their arms spread out straight and then start to lumber up and down the streets (They look like they flew out of "The Day the Earth Stood Still").  Events like this apparently happen quite frequently judging by the looks of things and the people are quick to call their hero Joe Sullivan (Jude Law), or as they call him Sky Captain, a man who flies around in an airplane and seems to fight against to forces of evil with his own private air force, complete with science lab and Bond-style gadgets built into his plane.<br /><br />Bad things are happening worldwide, and the authorities are balled.  Who could be doing this?  Leave it to Sky Captain to find out these events are orchestrated by the evil German scientist Dr. Totenkopf, who wants to retrieve two cylinders which were given to Joe's obsessive reporter ex-girlfriend, Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow), and soon the two of them are put together in an adventure to stop Totenkopf from destroying the world!  Along the way they're thrown into a serious of ridiculous action sequences, or moments where you expect to see the screen freeze and bold letters surface stating "Too be continued..." This is all part of the fun that is "Sky Captain."  This movie knows it's ridiculous, and that's the entire point, which it exploits whenever possible.<br /><br />Giovanni Ribisi is Sky Captain's gadget supplier, and is obviously inspired by Q from the orginal Bond films and Angelina Jolie also shows up as a sexy British pilot (Her British accent really hasn't improved that much since "Tomb Raider") in charge of a massive flying airstrip, which utilizes one of the most fun, if not most unbelievable designs in the entire movie.  Robots and flying airbases are only a few of the unbelievable, yet fun creations you get exposed to during this movie.  Everyone on the special effects team of this film must have had a lot of fun!<br /><br />The film is shot almost entirely with blue-screen and that gives the filmmakers lots of freedom with their visuals.  They could've gone overboard with this, but I feel they took it just far enough to capture the idea of the old serials and movies, and it all looked very nice on Blu-Ray.  I love this little effect they do that fades to colors to make it look like an old film.<br /><br />I just really like the feel of this film.  The actors know this is ridiculous, they know it's absurd, and they obviously have a lot of fun with the whole thing.  They could've played it to death giving winks to the audience, but they never do.  They act serious, but with an underlying message that they know what they're doing is silly.  They find a fine ground between campy and too serious, and just make this film very good as homage to those long forgotten films.<br /><br />The thing that got me was that in an age of serious films where we typically have emotionally confused heroes, and incredibly serious plots Director Kerry Conran actually went through with making a movie that paid homage to the movies, and serials of the 1930s-1950s.  Every character, every set piece, prop, and robot seems to have walked out of that early age of entertainment, and in my opinion the industry was in serious need of a retrieve from the barrage of serious films and a look back into a simpler time.<br /><br />This movie was an escape for me.  Don't get me wrong, I love serious movies, but I feel we need some movies like "Sky Captain" every now and then to help even out the industry, or else we may become too serious.  I don't want every movie I see to reflect the gritty horror that is reality and would like to every now and then escape back to childhood daydreams of airplanes that convert into submarines and where every character is clean cut, being really good or really bad.<br /><br />For people who enjoy special-effects or the old serials of the 1930s-40s "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow" is a must, or even for the people who enjoy the original James Bond films where just about anything seems possible.  This is Grade-A, no brain entertainment at its finest!</p></br><a href="../users/AQBRMBQ99ESI7.html">AQBRMBQ99ESI7</a><br/><p>The story takes place in a world that never was. The time is around the time of the Second World War but that war seems not to have taken place. Dirigibles like the Hindinburg III still ply the airways. People wear trench coats and fedoras. Vehicles are streamlined and there is a Deco feel to everything.<br /><br />There is trouble in the air. Famous scientists are disappearing. One calls ace reporter Polly Perkins to give her a heads up and reveals that all of the missing scientists were part of a secret project in Germany after the first World War. He is the last one.<br /><br />When some huge mechanical monsters show up in New York City, the emergency call goes out to Sky Captain to come and save the day. He flies a modified P 40 Warhawk with neat, albeit 1940ish James Bond style modifications. He also leads a mercenary Sky Legion to protect America. He manages to damage one of the huge mechanical monsters and save the life of his former girlfriend, Polly.<br /><br />It turns out that the mechanical monsters are striking all over the world and stealing the oddest things like power plant generators and zoo animals. Something strange is clearly going on and Sky Captain and the Perky Polly Perkins are going to find out what it is.<br /><br />It is, of course, a mad scientist plot which takes them all over the world before they learn of his Noah's Ark scheme.<br /><br />The story is mediocre. What is engrossing is the stunning array of visual effects. Its as if an old pulp comic book has come to life. Most of this film consists of computer generated effects that are the cutting edge of modernity but the feel is anything but modern. The style, art, lighting and feel of the thing scream of a bygone age. That was wonderful to see. I wish the movie had been as well. The acting and effects are fine. The story was probably not all that good back in the 30s, 40s or 50s.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PL8JA0TEHBVN.html">A1PL8JA0TEHBVN</a><br/><p>This film is visually stunning in HD-DVD.

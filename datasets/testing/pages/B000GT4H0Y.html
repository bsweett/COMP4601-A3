Even a 10 year old has more sense then you people.<br /><br />But it's goal is not to have a complex plot, but to be full of explosions, head twisting effects and crazy stunts. It is a good action/sci-fi movie, in which Milla Jovovich plays "Violent".

When you get to the point where you feel you need to be taking notes, it is just not a good sign. Not that the situation is all that confusing, to wit: in the future the human race is divided into normal humans and the Hemophages, who have a blood disease that makes them like vampires. Actually, it is more like they are called vampires, but if you are looking for this to matter in some significant way you will be disappointed. Incisors grow a bit longer and Violet Song ja Shariff (Milla Jovovich) comes back from the dead without exactly rising from the grave, and that is about it.<br /><br />Violet is sent off by her side to destroy a secret weapon which is in a case that she is repeatedly and emphatically told not to open, thereby guaranteeing that she will open it, not destroy it, and put herself in the middle of everything so that everybody will want to see her dead. Vicecardinum Ferdinand Daxus (Nick Chinlund) is the main villain, which means that when he and Violet finally get around to fighting with flaming swords we are just about at the end of the film. In between she basically kills everybody who tries to stop her from whatever she happens to be doing. Most of the action is decidedly uninspiring, but there are a few quick bits that will shake you from you lethargy and give you a brief moment of hope that things are looking up for this film.<br /><br />In terms of what category "Ultraviolet" ends up in, I would say that is definitely more of a comic book movie than a computer game movie. At first I thought it was obviously trying to be the latter, but there are just way too many shots and scenes that are clearly in keeping with the comic book approach to seeing the universe. Besides, the fight sequences with Violet usually tend to be quick and to the point, which is not the point of dispatching people in most computer games. If anything the violence is in keeping with Asian cinema. . The one thing I am sure of is that this film does not come close to taking from the best of any of these schools of influence. It has been a long time since I have been so easily bored by a science fiction film. Before Wimmer indulged in computer animated overkill, he should have come up with a much better plot to justify the time and the expense.</p></br><a href="../users/AJUFIGATSP9AQ.html">AJUFIGATSP9AQ</a><br/><p>Great atmospheric sci-fi with a light plot, like a twinkie. The movie lhas an 'Asian Anime' design that looks great to me. The film has more power in its style than its story, so don't look there, just enjoy the picture and accept the arcade game plot and look. Otherwise, go someplace else.<br />Great on BluRay! and DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A126KX6FVI4T66.html">A126KX6FVI4T66</a><br/><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800195175">The Fifth Element</a>with Milla Jovovich made me a fan.<br />Again she has a superhero type role but with violet hair instead of red.<br />This reminds me very much of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JMEW">Kill Bill, Volume 1</a><br />with Uma Thurman,but Ms. Jovovich doesn't have big feet.<br />Even faking playing with swords and guns is dangerous work.<br />My opinion is that Jovovivh can hold up on acting if she would try such roles. These films about virus killing off or mutating the human race are getting pretty old and too many of them!<br />This one is very well done with pretty good special effects.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ.html">A3KF4IP2MUS8QQ</a><br/><p>This is a pretty cool movie and all, but at some point you just have to pause and say, "Huh?" To borrow a phrase from the great and wise Ricky Ricardo, this movie has some 'splainin' to do. Heaven knows I love watching a young woman kick butt every which way from Sunday, and there's nothing sexier than the bare midriff look Milla Jovovich has going throughout this film, but -- and maybe I'm old-fashioned -- I sort of expect a movie to explain at least a few of its most unusual facets. For example, our heroine in this film can pull weapons out of thin air, make her hair and clothes change colors on a whim, and has no respect for the concept of gravity. All I know about her is that she was a normal human being who caught an engineered virus that turned her into a hemophage, died and was restored to life for further testing, and then escaped. I can buy into the whole heightened senses thing, but how this allows her to morph and avoid hails of bullets fired directly at her is quite beyond me. While I'm at it, let me also say that the central storyline has more cracks in it than, uh, something full of cracks. The ending is pure deus ex machina squared.<br /><br />The movie starts off great, though. I really liked the comic book montage style of the opening credits, and the film itself wastes no time in throwing Violet (Milla Jovovich) up against hordes of bad guys trying to kill her. The point of her initial, solo raid is to steal a new weapon the humans have designed, a weapon supposedly capable of wiping out Violet and all of her fellow hemophages. Said weapon turns out to be unlike anything you would expect, and Violet's decision to protect it rather than destroy it sets the stage for the remainder of the film. Her hemophage allies want the weapon either brought to them or destroyed, Vice Cardinal Ferdinand Daxus (Nick Chinlund), the weapon's creator and all-around power-hungry tyrant, wants it back, and Violet has to forge her own path through all this mess.<br /><br />Obviously, the filmmakers just wanted to show ninety minutes of Milla Jovovich doing what she does best, and the plot they threw together is really just a means to that end. The basic storyline is easy enough to follow, but far too many of its details go unexplained. As for the special effects and fight scenes, there's some really gnarly stuff on display here, but a lot of the CGI work is just overkill. Additionally, the cameramen are like kids with a new toy as they experiment with every angle known to man.<br /><br />Despite its inherent weaknesses, though, I really enjoyed the first hour or so of this film -- and then the novelty of all the fast and furious action wore off, leaving me to wade through another half hour of a pretty slippery and generally unimpressive story. Even the action goes downhill as the climax approaches, as too many of Violet's fights prove to be laughably easy ' and accompanied by incredibly clich&eacute; dialogue. The bottom line is this: Ultraviolet will definitely get your blood pumping, but it inevitably puts your brain cells on standby.</p></br><a href="../users/AYG1U47VFZ165.html">AYG1U47VFZ165</a><br/><p>I guess there's a guilty pleasure wrapped up here somewhere in ULTRAVIOLET, a bloated video-gamer's paradise of a movie with action sequences quite possibly choreographed by Maybelline in order to provide the most subtle, haunting, and pristine glances at the features of Milla Jovovich.  All kidding aside, she is quite stunning to look at.<br /><br />The plot -- not that one matters! -- is inconsequential here.  All the film is shuttles between excuses to get from each action set piece to the next compliments of plenty of obvious CGI.  Don't get me wrong!  When it's action, it's quite pretty ... arguably as pretty as is the film's lead.  It's Milla fighting, Milla shooting, Milla on a motorcycle, Milla swinging a samurai sword ... so many bodies, so little time (7 minutes longer than the theatrical cut for those of you keeping track).<br /><br />In a film where the science is largely unexplained and sacrificed to the world of magic (Violet has a mystical belt buckle that not only allows her to ignore the law of gravity but also anything she's riding, too!), what matters is that it all look pretty, and, on that level, I guess it's safe to conclude that the package is delivered.  While she's young and in shape, Ms. Jovovich can make flicks like this around the clock, and she'll always have SOME audience ... once the movie ends, they'll all head back home to their XBoxes.<br /><br />I will say this: there's no doubt in my mind that whatever ULTRAVIOLET is based on -- a graphic novel, a video game, or something less three-dimensional -- it's probably quite better than this stinker of a story.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>'Ultraviolet' is the most recent arrival from an evergrowing number of films with plots dealing with beautiful and deadly warrior women in sexy skin tight costumes fighting injustice. Milla Jovovich (Resident Evil) is back once again doing what she does best, terminate evil.<br /><br />Set far into the future, after most of mankind has been wiped out by a devastating biological holocaust those that remain have been divided into two warring camps, humans and hemophages. The hemophages are comprised of humans who have been infected by a virius that bestows vampire-like physical attributes and physical abilities, but also accelerates the aging process. Ultraviolet is the most deadly hemophage assassin who has been sent on a mission that will change the balance of power forever if successful. That is if she decides to complete the assignment as originally planned.<br /><br />Yes the storyline does lack substance but there is so much non-stop action in this film there really isn't much room between fight scenes to fit one in. The special effects are definitely not the best I've ever seen, but passable. As for Milla, she says it herself, "I'm a Titan, a monolith. Nothing can stop me." She's absolutely right!</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>The first thing that struck me about "Ultraviolet" was just how stylized each frame of film was. This is due to more than just CGI; there's also a surreal quality to the characters, their skin a little too smooth and their complexions a little too vibrant to pass off as realistic. No question about it; it was fascinating to look at. And let's not forget the high tech shots of firearms and swords materializing from tiny devices worn on the assailants' wrists. That was fascinating to look at, as well. But as with a lot of big budget action flicks, this is a visually stunning piece that lags behind on story and dialogue, and for the general movie going population, it would only come off as a headache inducing music video.<br /><br />But for the comic book buffs and action film junkies, these are qualities that just might make their day. Made in the tradition of adrenaline pumping sci-fi films like the "Matrix" Trilogy (and even more so like the "Underworld" films), "Ultraviolet" is a perfect example of a film adapted from original comic book material: it's overwhelmingly frenetic, filled to the brim with highly choreographed fight sequences and completely saturated with futuristic details (including architecture, weapons, and costumes; one building is shaped like the biohazard symbol). Its energetic pace is enhanced by means of Klaus Badelt's throbbing score, an opus inspired by the hypnotic beats of techno clubs. At times I wondered why they even bothered trying to come up with a story; the battle scenes were entertaining enough, as was seeing Milla Jovovich in yet another superhero-type role. (And we all know she's not too bad looking; why else would a few seconds be reserved to show her exposed behind?).<br /><br />But if you're hoping to experience a meaningful story with a cleverly disguised hidden message, then this is the wrong movie for you. Set in some distant yet unspecified future year, the movie begins with the voiceover narration of Violet (Milla Jovovich), saying, "I was born into a world you probably wouldn't understand." She goes on to say that, in an attempt to eradicate a deadly viral infection, the government's scientists only managed to make it stronger. It then spread quickly, mutating countless numbers of civilians into a race of modernized vampires called Hemophanges, humanoids with superior skill and intelligence. Many of them are then taken away and exterminated (and this parallels history with disturbing accuracy). But a few survived, and they are the ones who fight back.<br /><br />And it's a good thing, too. A militant government corporation led by the organized and seemingly germophobic Daxus (Nick Chinlund) has apparently developed a secret weapon meant to exterminate Hemophanges once and for all. Violet is sent to retrieve this weapon, and she painstakingly does so, going through scores of guards and security personnel with her lightening fast reflexes and razor sharp senses (along with a few well places slices of her machete-type blade).<br /><br />The initially straightforward plan unravels when she takes a peek inside the weapon case and discovers a human child. His name is Six (Cameron Bright), a quiet, somewhat melodramatic character that has been genetically modified. How and for what purpose is one of the mysteries of the story, which wouldn't have been so bad had a fewer number of twists and revelations been used. Everything we suspect about him is disregarded at one point or another, and after a while, it becomes exhausting trying to invest in an unknowable character. (And has Bright ever played a normal child? All he seems to be able to play are brooding, disturbed children, like in "Godsend," and "Birth.") The only way to determine anything at all about him is to analyze his relationship with Violet. At first, she only sees him as a means to save her own life. But as the story progresses, she grows more and more attached to him. There is a specific reason for this, but telling you what it is would be giving too much away. Let's just say that her life experiences have left lasting impressions.<br /><br />I think the biggest problem this film has is that certain things are just too unbelievable, even for a comic book. For one thing, Violet has the ability to defeat dozens of artillery and self-defense trained guards with minimal effort. You'd think this could be excused; remember that Hemophanges are physically superior to humans, and because of this, they should be able to take on any form of attack. Yet Daxus and his men are able to gun down Violet's comrades as easily as if they were swatting flies. Does this mean that somehow she's an even more superior being? I would have liked it if the film had answered this question, but since they didn't, all I can do is guess that it was for the sake of plot advancement.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the plot has so many holes in it that any form of advancement would be incoherent. Such a large chunk of necessary information is left in the dark, most of which is detail regarding Violet and the government (in other words; all the main characters). None of this is helped much by the amateurish dialogue: a blending of first-draft-quality one liners and fragmented attempts at voiceover summations. Granted, a lot of comic books are written like that, and if you enjoy reading them, then you'll probably find that "Ultraviolet" succeeds in every way. I'm sure the violence will keep many people cheering and hollering (even though this is a virtually gore free film). And the special effects are top notch; who cares whether or not they harm an already weak story instead of help it? Some don't care, and for them, this film will be waiting. For everyone else, it's best to just avoid it altogether.</p></br><a href="../users/AS6SH2JM2YY3H.html">AS6SH2JM2YY3H</a><br/><p>Milla Jovovich is Ultraviolet, a "hemophage" infected human who is stronger and faster than everybody else, including other Hemophages (those infected with the hemophage virus).  A government official is charged with eliminating her kind from the face of the Earth, and he is most successful.<br /><br />There are extraordinary scenes in this movie, including the gravity-defying motorcycle chase, the internally stored weapons, and the use of exploding glass-like "shields" instead of blood to signify the destruction of a human guard/soldier.<br /><br />I watched the "Unrated, Extended Cut," and there was nothing I could see (not having seen the original) that would make me think that the rating was spooky (using the formula, "unrated" = more body parts or uncovered bodies).<br /><br />Like in the film it is often compared to (Aeon Flux), the story line took a while to understand.  Understanding that science fiction allows for violations of physical laws, what I really didn't understand was why these Hemophages had technologies so far beyond the humans, and the humans didn't even seem to be interested in obtaining these technologies (for example, the gravity defying feats).<br /><br />All in all, Ultraviolet was much more entertaining than I had expected from the poor reviews I had read in the newspaper.  You gotta love the genre...</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>Ultraviolet sheds light on a futuristic society that has been plagued by a virus that nearly transformed the population into hemophages (vampire-like creatures), but has survived and is now on its way back to full recovery.<br />A carrier of the virus takes it upon herself to steal the government's secret project believing that it is a weapon meant to destroy them.  What she ends up with, however, maybe more than she bargained for...<br />There are strong elements/hints of Aeon Flux, Underworld, and V for Vendetta, so the movie falls into the sci-fi/action/adventure type of category.<br />Apart from Milla Jovovich (who is GORGEOUS!!!) and the lovely colors seen throughout the film, the plot and the dialogues are poor at best.<br />The rest of the cast is mediocre.  As for the computer graphics, they are not that great and often one gets the feeling that they are watching a computer game of average graphics instead of a motion picture.<br />Though not a masterpiece and probably not a movie you would want to add to your collection, Ultraviolet might provide for an evening's entertainment.  3.5 Stars</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>I recommend Ultraviolet for a rental.  The sets are gorgeous and Milla Jovovich is easy on the eyes in her midriff-baring, tight leather outfits.  There are clever, original ideas for technology and weaponry.  The story is good and compelling for the first half.  Violet is a former nurse who contracted the "plague," a disease of the blood that gives the victim vampire-like characteristics.  No blood-drinking in this film; what a relief!  Like the X-Men, "hemophages" are fighting active persecution by the government.<br /><br />Violet has become a lethal assassin.  When asked to retrieve a case and not to open it, her feminine curiousity gets the better of her.  She finds the "secret weapon" she retrieved is a young boy.  Refusing to let him become a pawn in the blood wars, she simultaneously fights to unravel the mystery of where he came from, and to save his life.<br /><br />The film starts to go downhill as Violet, and the movie, lose their credulity, as she wipes out entire armies just because she is "pissed off."  As the villian says, "One woman against (insert number) of men?  Ridiculous."  Yes, it is, and the viewer quickly loses interest.<br /><br />Nevertheless, a good try from Kurt Wimmer and worth seeing once.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QEATH3NODFM.html">A38QEATH3NODFM</a><br/><p>This movie turned out to be a dissapointment to me.  I think I am a fare fan of Science fiction movies, and I love to see a good adaptation from a comic, but this movie was missed the spot. First off, the acting was horrible. It seemed at time during the movie that they were reading off of cue cards or reading for the first time, no emotions with their deliveries, and the dialog back and forth was poorly written. Also, the computer animation part of the movie was to much, just didn't look good at all.  Finally, whats the deal with the antigravity everything and the color shifting cloths, Is that in the comic book?  If it is, I appologize, but if it was a movie adaptation, it would have been nice to have a little explanation behind the mechanism of some of these devices, and that would have been solved by actually puting in some real dialog.  I did not rate this a one, because it did have some ok fight scenes, but this is just worth a rental, unless you are a huge fan.</p></br><a href="../users/A2G6GO4O7EVCPF.html">A2G6GO4O7EVCPF</a><br/><p>Milla Jovovich (The Fifth Element, The Messenger) plays Alice...oh I mean Violet, a half human and half vampire fanged fighter of her people. Nick Chinlund (Con Air, Tears of the Sun) plays Daxus, a human with ridiculous noseplugs who wants to destory the race that Jovovich belongs to. Jovovich then helps out a little boy clonse of Daxus named Six played by Cameron Bright (Running Scared, Godsend) who may be a cure to cure Jovovich's fang problem. William Fichtner (Tv's Invasion, Armageddon) also stars as Garth, a friend of Violet's. Kurt Wimmer who directed the much better Equilibrium fails in Ultraviolet resulting in a BOMB and beyond. Jovovich plays the same performance here that she does in the Resident Evil movies which is really annoying. It's too bad you're doing this spit Jovovich...too bad. Fichtner and Chinlund are wasted and Bright plays the same performance like so many of his other films. That kid needs a break. All the acting with the dialouge is dense and the action scenes are pretty weak. Also starring a seriously horrible Sebastien Andrieu (Look at Me).</p></br><a href="../users/A18RQ2URRGIIEA.html">A18RQ2URRGIIEA</a><br/><p>The 2006 film "Ultraviolet", which was written and directed by Kurt Wimmer, portrays the story of a female vampire named Violet (Milla Jovovich, who may be best remembered for her portrayal of the character Leeloo in the 1997 sci-fi film "The Fifth Element"), who, with other vampires (or as they are called in the film, hemophages), fight government & corporate agents who are determined to destroy them.  The surreal futuristic world of "Ultraviolet" is one in which many people have been infected by a disease that transforms them into hemophages.  Those that are not infected wear large amounts of protective rubber clothing and gas masks (especially soldiers, whose faces are never seen) to avoid being infected.  The point of this film?  Daxus (Nick Chinlund), a seemingly uninfected human in charge, creates clones of himself with which he hopes to destroy the hemophages.  One of the clones, a boy named Six (Cameron Bright), is captured by violet; but instead of destroying him as the other hemophages want her to do, Violet befriends & protects the boy.  Hence, most of this comic-book-like film involves unrealistic martial-arts fighting, lots of weapons, motorcycles, protective gear, an evil corporate boss, an innocent boy and a woman (Violet) who can't decide what hair color she wants as it periodically changes.<br /><br />If you were looking for good acting, an interesting story, well-written dialog, engaging characters and an entertaining sci-fi film, chances are rather high that you won't find any of that in the film "Ultraviolet".  So (not surprisingly), the only rating that I can give to this uninspired & uninteresting film is 1 out of 5 stars.  My only recommendation: if you want to watch this film, either watch it on TV or rent it before you decide to purchase a copy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TK6R2JSC97HL.html">A1TK6R2JSC97HL</a><br/><p>"Ultraviolet" is set in some near-future dystopia in which mankind is split between normal humans and "hemophages" - superhuman but short lived freaks created when an ancient virus was rediscovered and accidentally released.  With vampire-like teeth, HP's are easy to spot, and since they don't wear any gear to protect themselves from a virus they've already got, they're hard to miss even without being the most overstyled characters on screen.  Hunted down by "Arch-Minister Daxus", the HP's strike back - it's the "Blood War".  Violet is one of best HP's warriors, capable of mowing down Daxus's troops, breaking into his most secure facilities and possessing the flattest abs on Earth.  Violet has stolen a new weapon capable of exterminating the HP's, but she finds that the weapon is a young boy named Six (Cameron Bright).  It's not clear how he's a danger to the HP's, but the script wisely accepts that ambiguity, and soon everybody wants Six dead.  Obeying a deep maternal instinct, Violet turns against everybody else to protect Six.<br /><br />THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A DECENT MOVIE IF: Reading my own synopsis, it's easy to see how UV could have rocked, which makes it at least as easy to list the sins (multitudinous here) that killed it.  In fact, "Ultraviolet" wastes little time before proving itself one of the single most preposterous movies ever made, a botch on every level - sci-fi actioner or even cautionary fable.<br /><br />Wimmer was supposedly deposed by the studio which released a chopped-down version, but what's left in the mix - like an HP - looks too inherently wrong to have been cured by simply extra footage.  The amateurish script kicks off with embarrassingly expository dialog  ("As you know our campaign against the hemophages has been highly effective") and garish set-design.  It's downhill from there.<br /><br />UV is supposedly set in the 21st century.  I can accept widely varying visions of how this century will look by the time it's half-over, consistency requires that one society remain within a single vision.  In UV, however, we still have cars, helicopters and firearms even though mankind has created devices that manipulate gravity and otherwise bend relative dimensions in space (Violet can store scads of weaponry in some sort of personal hyperspace - allowing her to single-handedly stage her own rip-off of the famous "lobby scene" from the first "Matrix" movie without being weighed down by some big duffle bag or having to wear anything that might obscure her superhuman abs; the humans possess this technology as well, with "Six" being carried around in an attach&eacute; case looking like a slightly outsized Macbook).  Any civilization advanced enough to re-write the laws of gravity and relative dimensions would have gotten past submachine pistols, rotary-wing aircraft or Buicks.  The world of "Ultraviolet" isn't so much advanced as "futuristic" - it looks very mod without actually being a plausible vision of an era set beyond our own.  Even the HP's amount to less of a plot element than a plothole.  The HP virus is extremely infectious - a point made well at the beginning of the flick when one of Daxus's men realizes that an unfortunate HP splattered him with its blood.  Unfortunately, this otherwise good scene is almost as fatally infected as the henchman, since it occurs inside the humans' blood bank.  Perhaps the HPs - who broke in without an exit strategy - intended a suicide mission to infect the blood.  The problem is that if the virus is that infectious, HP's wouldn't need to get to the humans' blood supply, they could just infect whole neighborhoods.  Humans wear all sorts of facial covers, but expose skin which proves sufficiently vulnerable to the HP virus.<br /><br />UV fails as an actioner because it's astoundingly arbitrary.  Daxus's hordes fire hundreds of bullets at Violet without scoring a hit - even when she's directly in their line of fire - while they fall in human waves under Violet's guns.  In a similar scene, Daxus faces off three armed HPs by himself, and dispatches them with a miracle machine pistol that can fire a fatal shot to each of three men in a single three-short burst, even when they fire first.  (This is most obvious in sword fighting scenes where hordes of enemy swordsmen are clearly swinging AWAY from Violet.)  Because the script can scare up few characters to pit against Violet, it's forced to throw at her large numbers of faceless hordes at her from the beginning.  Costumes aside, all fight scenes pit Violet against large numbers of apparently well trained and armed troops who simply cannot kill her.  In the ultimate of the flick's idiot-scenes, Violet is encircled by hostile rival HPs who are too stylishly duked out to realize that in encircling Violet with their guns drawn, they're targeting each other.  The script offers no explanation for its unbalanced lethality, instead drawing it to our attention when Violet warns Six that their enemies "will kill you without even thinking".  Putting aside the obvious joke that UV could do with fewer thoughtless killers, despite the firepower expended at that point and the stakes involved, "Ultraviolet" was surprisingly short on death, as if the film was so eager to kill without a thought that that the script had simply forgotten to kill anybody.  Daxus flops as a villain because he doesn't do much in a flick that defines its heroes and villains more in terms of style than good or evil deeds.  True, the plot has Daxus's ministry paralleling the actions of the WWII genocide, but that happens in the flick's brief expository prolog.  The bulk of the movie only shows the ministry getting its desserts for that prolog, and not doing much to deserve that reception.  In other words, despite his sneers and army of minions (and despite none-too-subtle clues that identify Daxus with the religious-right), Daxus begins the movie as a victim, not the villain.<br /><br />In short, "Ultraviolet" is a flick that's horrible and never stops reminding you of that fact.</p></br><a href="../users/AIIR8E34EDKCQ.html">AIIR8E34EDKCQ</a><br/><p>There are many reasons why I liked Ultraviolet but first and foremost I liked it for the intense, graphic and innovative fight sequences that splattered my screen from the second I pressed play. In books I expect the story to stir up the images but in movies it's the visuals that rock my world, and the story follows closely behind.<br /><br /> This movie surely had my eyes  and my mind captivated from start to finish. The story as far fetched as it was didn't throw me off, as I followed Violet, played by Milla Jovovich who in my mind was born to play quirky high combat characters, and her team of friends and foes as the so called, Blood Wars fed life cycles of modern Earth. She  is on a  mission which  I will not give away, but  that  mission makes her angry,  unstoppable and out for blood as she flew, drove , kicked, shot, sliced though and propelled herself again st laws of gravity towards her goal. The colors, liquid metallics, flying  scraps of matter,  bullets, heart stopping stunts and  her motorbike skills left me with my  mouth open and my brain entertained in a way that  is hard for most movies.  I have never seen the Ultraviolet comics but this movie was swimming in special effects so collaborative that all fantastic movies now have more to struggle against as this set new standards .<br /><br />I know I  might have more unusual liking for movies than the majority, and as many people didn't seem to like it, I have to  say that this was wonderful and intense  beyond what I expected. The music by Klaus  Badelt was just as magnificent  and will have to go on top of my movie scores list. Great movie,  as long as seen with an open mind and total openness for some fantastic butt kicking as it blends  Kill Bill, The Matrix,  Aliens and  all my favorite super heroes into one.</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>"Hello. My name is Violet and I was born into a world you may not understand."  That's the first line of dialog heard from the film Ultraviolet (2006)...after watching the movie last night, I think the following would have been more appropriate..."Hello. My name is Violet and I was born into a movie you may not understand (or even like)."  Written and directed by Kurt Wimmer (Sphere, Equilibrium), the film stars Milla Jovovich (Dazed and Confused, The Fifth Element, Resident Evil).  Also appearing is Cameron Bright (X-Men: The Last Stand), Nick Chinlund (Con Air, The Chronicles of Riddick), Sebastien Andrieu, and William Fichtner (Heat, The Perfect Storm).<br /><br />As the movie, set in a messed up future (isn't that always the case?), begins we see some giant bowling balls dropped from the air into a building, and once inside the balls turn into deadly assassins...well, that's a pretty neat trick...anyway, some stuff happens, which leads into a lengthy flashback with voiceover by Jovovich.  Apparently, some time ago, a nasty virus was found in Eastern Europe, one which Western powers tried to modify in order to create super soldiers or some such thing, but all they really ended up doing was creating a nastier form of the virus, one which gives it's victims sharper eyesight, acute hearing, enhanced strength, superior healing abilities, and vampire fangs...so what's the downside?  Well I tell you...the victims are generally sensitive to light and have an extremely shortened lifespan.  Seems those affected, known as Hemophages, were then rounded up by the norms and put into camps for experimentation, and those still on the loose formed an underground resistance movement, of which Violet (Jovovich) is a member.  All right, as the flashback/background stuff comes to a close, we find out Vice Cardinal Ferdinand Daxus (Chinlund), the egomaniacal tyrant ruler of the norms has developed a new super weapon, one that supposedly will eliminate the Hemophage threat once and for all, but Violet nicks it through a lengthy and involved series of high-octane action sequences.  As it turns out, the weapon just happens to be an idiot child named Six (Bright), whose blood, while deadly to Hemophages, may also contain a cure.  Violet soon finds herself stuck in the middle as the leader of the Hemophages, some Euro trash named Nerva (Andrieu) wants the kid dead, while the Vice Cardinal wants back what's his...what follows are numerous dead end scenes between Violet and the kid, lots of running around, some fight sequences, some back door dealing, and ultimately a final showdown as Violet battles her way through an army into the belly of the beast (the Arch Ministry building) to face off against the Vice Cardinal himself, who has some serious secrets of his own...<br /><br />By the end of this film I was somewhat aggravated...why?  A number of reasons, but the main one being it seemed like the story was a patchwork of ideas and concepts, none of them developed particularly well.  I did like all the action sequences up front, but once those passed, we were left with having to sit through a whole lot of rotten acting and goofy dialog, the latter being the weakest element of this film, for me, at least.  One example in particular happens after Violet liberates Six, and is on the run.  After a close encounter with armed authorities, Violet asks Six "Are you damaged?"  Why not just ask "Are you hurt?"...I'll tell you why...because it's the future and asking someone if they're `damaged' sounds a lot cooler than asking them if they're hurt, at least in Wimmer's mind, I think.  In my mind it just came off as idiotic...I've read the studio re-cut some of the film prior to its release, and even removed some sequences (I read the original film ran about a half hour longer).  Did this meddling hurt the movie, resulting in a less than desirable end product?  I don't think so, as the flaws seemed ingrained regardless of any tinkering (for a prime example of this go rent the theatrical and renegade DVD releases of the 1991 film Highlander II: The Quickening and tell me which is better).  I liked the exteriors, some of the special effects were pretty spiffy (some seemed ridiculously phony), and the fight sequences, for the most part, were fairly engaging, but the slower moments in the middle really caused the feature to drag out.  I found it rather annoying near the end when Violet, the one woman army, was invading the Arch Ministry building, and we'd see her come up against a whole mess of guards, only to cut to a scene with her coming through a door, and beyond the door we see the guards from the previous scene lying dead.  I did learn a lot from this film, including the following...<br /><br />1. Milla Jovovich sure likes to show off her midriff (and I like to see it).<br /><br />2. Body armor in the future is pretty ineffectual given it's tendency to shatter like glass when struck.<br /><br />3. Germophobia runs wild in the future, to the extent of affecting fashions as people don designer air masks and surgical gowns.<br /><br />4. In the future you'll be able to carry small to medium sized children around inside fancy, fashionable briefcases that double as backpacks.<br /><br />5. Uzis fitted with blades that stick out from the bottom seems like overkill (and kinda dumb).<br /><br />6. Extremely long hair can be detrimental to its owner during hand-to-hand combat.<br /><br />7. The biohazard symbol seems an awkward and impractical design for a building.<br /><br />8. In the future most all interiors will be designed to look like bad discoth&egrave;ques.<br /><br />9. Milla Jovovich's character seems the only one who actually knows how to fight.<br /><br />10. Milla Jovovich's character can literally pull futuristic gizmos and weaponry out of her ash.<br /><br />11. Sword usage returns to fashion in the future.<br /><br />12. What's the only thing cooler than a sword fight sequence?  A flaming sword fight sequence!<br /><br />All in al the film is very slick, stylish, and colorful, laden with a good deal of flashy action sequences (wire work galore) and special effects, but hamstrung by poor performances, terrible dialog, and not a lot of substance.  By the way, I've got the `Unrated, Extended' version, which runs about six minutes longer than the theatrical release, but I seriously doubt anyone who only saw the original release is missing much as I doubt those six minutes included anything critical or even worthwhile to the actual film.  More or less labeling this the `Unrated, Extended' version was just an attempt by the studio to breathe new life in the aftermarket into a film that died in the box office.<br /><br />The picture, presented in anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1), looks very sharp and the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround audio comes through fine.  Skimpy extras include an uninteresting commentary track with Milla Jovovich by herself (where the heck is Wimmer?), a featurette titled UV Protection: The Making of Ultraviolet, and English subtitles.  Also thrown in are previews for other Sony DVD release including Final Fantasy: Advent Children (2005), Mirrormask (2005), Marilyn Hotchkiss Ballroom Dancing & Charm School (2005), The Fog (2005), The Benchwarmers (2006), and Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006).<br /><br />Cookieman108</p></br><a href="../users/A2IZIYYCEGOMEU.html">A2IZIYYCEGOMEU</a><br/><p>No, the CGI isn't as good as that in THE MATRIX, but Milla can out-act Keanu any day of the week ( of course, that can be said of most corpses... ). True, the story is a rather pastiche affair, and the dialogue can sometimes be a bit over-cooked, but damn!- Milla is fun to watch! Oddly enough, I was apparently one of the few that viewed this pic without expecting it to be on a par with CITIZEN KANE ( though I am a huge fan of Welles' classic ). If you enjoy watching fun, somewhat over-the-top fight scenes, with a very easy-on-the-eyes, kickass heroine, good color, and non-stop action, this might be right up your alley. If, however, you're looking for Lawrence Olivier's version of HAMLET, this ain't it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1HO9J4DCQDGP9.html">A1HO9J4DCQDGP9</a><br/><p>I actually really liked this movie, I had been wary about watching as it as it was panned by so many people but I thought it was great, amazing special effects, fabulous fight sequences, and a reasonably good plot that yet perhaps could do with a bit of tightening up but all in all it was worth watching.<br /><br />Take a future city, filled with humans and Vampires, only they aren't called Vampires, they are known as hemophages, and they are faster, and stronger than your average human but they are also hated and feared by humans and have all but been hunted into extinction.  Add to this concoction a beautiful hemophage called Violet , Milla Jovovich in her scantily dressed best whose fighting skills are legendary, a megalomaniac leader with a deadly secret, a human child known as Six whose very body is a weapon and who brings out the maternal instinct in Violet and a gentle but scientifically gifted hemophage played by the delectable William Fichtner who loves Violet and will do anything to save her.<br /><br />The movie is non stop action from beginning to end, and is quite amusing in parts too, like when one of the Vampires warn Violet that they are as fast and as strong as she is, but she points out that she is far more pissed off than they are, not only that but her maternal ire is up and she will do anything she can to save Six a child who is slowly dying from whatever has been added to his blood but with whom she shares a bond of loss, pain, sorrow and possible redemption.<br /><br />Despite the critics and reviewers panning this movie I give it a quality five out of five based on a high enjoyment factor of the fight scenes, the scenery, the drop dead gorgeous costumes that Violet gets to wear, the state of the art special effects and the quirky dialogue.<br /><br />I wish I had seen it on the big screen though, it must have been a sight to behold!</p></br><a href="../users/AMIOLJHCQHGBE.html">AMIOLJHCQHGBE</a><br/><p>Nighly stylized movie that uses Sky Captain CPG with an Equilibrium theme.<br /><br />In the future, a blood disease creats a world of normals and hemophobes. I'm good with that part, and Mila Jovinovitch rocks as the comic book hero `Ultraviolet'. What doesn't rock is her ability to create weapons out of thin air. There is no explaination how, and the dumbass drones after her don't have the same ability. Personally, I wonder how a lowly rebel could have more at her disposal than a government funded ARMY of top notch killers!<br /><br />The whole film is shot in CG touches a la Sky Captain and The World Of Tommorrow. This supposed to be about her being a rebel and rescuing a human child with a protein in his blood that can cure the world's `vampire' problem. In reality, it is simply an outlandish style of cinematography.<br /><br />Normally, I would have given this a 1 star. Poor piece of film. Period. BUT, after the Resident Evil series, I felt MJ did a very nice job here. Thus the 2 stars.<br /><br />Do not buy, but wsit until it is on cable, which I did.

The acting was bad, monotone, and one dimensional..... No depth of character.<br /><br />The fight scenes were badly choreographed, phony looking and fake. Too many of the fight scenes in "Ultraviolet" were poorly reminscent of "The Matrix" and "Aeon Flux", and made this movie feel like a shoddy imitation in comparison. Both "The Matrix" and "Aeon Flux" were far superior movies in in terms of plot, acting, special effects, fight sequences and more.<br /><br />Ending of this movie wasn't great either, nor very creative. Found it difficult to want to watch this movie through it's end result.<br /><br />Don't waste money or time renting or buying this movies!</p></br><a href="../users/A34VV92TSLC37R.html">A34VV92TSLC37R</a><br/><p>Ultraviolet follows the exploits of Violet, played by Milla Jovovich, in a futuristic society in which many citizens are infected with a virus, and then are immediately "disposed of" by the government.  Those infected with the virus are called hemophages, or vampires.  In this movie, however, the hemophages don't literally suck the blood from people, they use other sources, such as blood banks or what not to retrieve their fuel.  Violet is a hemophage, who has decided not to take it anymore, and she joins up with a hemophage resistance group.  When the humans discover a "weapon" that will destroy all hemophages, the hemophages send in Violet to retrieve the weapon before the government can use it.  When Violet discovers that this weapon is really a young boy, she decides to betray everyone she's ever known for some random child that she knows nothing about.<br /><br />First, let me start with the positives of the film.  Firstly, the film is visually stunning.  It looks very similar to Wimmer's previous film, Equilibrium, but Ultraviolet is a lot more colorful than the dark environment of Equilibrium.  Secondly, the action scenes in the film actually aren't all that bad.  The first 20 minutes of the film is straight up action, and after that point, I actually had my hopes up a little bit.  Yes, the effects look fake most of the time, but the film was obviously trying to look like a comic book, and it succeeds in that aspect.<br /><br />Now, the negatives, which are fairly numerous, so I will try to be brief.  The first, and worst, negative of the film is the acting.  Simply put, it is horrendous.  Milla Jovovich has never been known for her acting ability, but that is why she is normally in films that really require no emotion from the leading lady.  Unfortunately, the writing in this film requires Violet to actually show emotion and caring for this boy that she is protecting.  It isn't just Jovovich's lack of acting ability, though, it is also the inept script that Kurt Wimmer put together.  One second, Violet is portrayed as an extremely lethal, uncaring vampire, who will kill anyone in her way.  The next moment, and for no reason, we are supposed to believe that Violet would betray everyone she's ever known just after seeing the boy,  not even talking to him or finding out exactly why he is considered a "weapon."  The "Archcardinal," the villain, is also a horrible actor.  I don't even know this guy's name, and I never want to.  Portrayed as the classic movie villain, he has so many cheesy lines that just make you want to laugh, no matter how serious the film is trying to be.<br /><br />It is also amazing how the film drags in the middle.  Even though the film runs a meager 85 minutes, it seemed like it was at least two hours long, and that is really unbelievable.  When there isn't action occurring onscreen, it is pointless dialogue about a plot that the viewer knows absolutely nothing about, except for a brief overview by Violet at the beginning of the film.  Ultimately, I just found myself sitting in the theater, just waiting for the film to finally come to the end, and when it did, I was overjoyed.<br /><br />The really sad thing about the film is that the basic setup could actually be used to make an interesting, possibly good movie.  I think that Wimmer was trying to send a message through the film, as he did with Equilibrium, but he failed as a filmmaker on just about every level in this film.  Whatever message Wimmer was trying to send, it was completely lost in the grade-school acting, boring dialogue, and ridiculously overdone (but enjoyable) action scenes.  Her name is Violet, and she is in a movie that you definitely won't understand (or like).</p></br><a href="../users/AK0CENM3LUM28.html">AK0CENM3LUM28</a><br/><p>Ultraviolet / B000FGGE5Y<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />Oh, I really wanted to like Ultraviolet. I wasn't expecting a whole lot, just some decent action and a nifty dystopia, something along the lines of Aeon Flux, Equilibrium, and (of course) The Matrix.<br /><br />Ultraviolet starts off with a bang. Milla is a superb action heroine, as always, and she dazzles with a wonderful combination of high-tech gadgetry (she's got an anti-gravity device!), high-speed chases, and high-skill martial arts. Combo in an intriguing (if a bit long and draggy) voice-over involving vampires, and Milla's mysteriously changing hair color, and this should be a perfect mindless Friday night flick.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the action slows to a crawl after the first twenty minutes (as do the cool hair color changes - it will remain disappointingly black for the rest of the movie, despite all the cool changes you saw in the previews), and you won't get to see too many more fancy moves until the final race to the finish. The filler dialogue is teeth-grindingly bad, with Milla having approximately eighteen earnest heart-to-hearts with the Capture/Rescue Kid. Some of these heart-to-hearts occur back to back and while enemy soldiers are closing in, and the resulting overexposure of Milla's tender side (which the savvy user grasped in the initial opening voice over, for crying out loud) feels like a hammer to the temples. She's a vampire! She's dying! She's saddened by the loss of her pregnancy! She's bonding with the child! Yeah, we got it.<br /><br />Really, this would have been a much better film if the writers had trusted the audience to get it and just cut 90% of the filler dialogue and just left us 'silent scenes' instead of Milla dragging her reluctant charge around this world gone mad. Although I love mindless action films, I simply can't bear to sit through Ultraviolet again, so I'm selling my copy and hoping the next Milla film will have better writing that she deserves.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></br><a href="../users/A2ATWKOFJXRRR1.html">A2ATWKOFJXRRR1</a><br/><p>Milla Jovovich appeared in one of my all-time favorite sci-fi action comedies (The Fifth Element), but she also holds the title of "Most Overused Female Actress" in some really shoddy flicks (Resident Evil, Dummy, and Return to the Blue Lagoon just to touch on a few). So I hesitate whenever I see her name attached to a title. Perhaps her agent needs to be a bit more selective when handing her manuscripts.<br /><br />So it is with a heavy heart that I have to say her unfortunate role selections seem to have no end in sight with the addition of ULTRAVIOLET to her sagging film repertoire.<br /><br />Vampires (aka Hemophages) have been done to death, but I don't mind that. If a story is interesting and contains vampires, hey, that's fine by me. But shoving Milla into a body-fitting, white leather outfit and having her kick [...] in almost every scene makes me think that much more could've been made out of this film rather than just a vampiric female ruffian who's deadly with a blade. Swinging swords and Matrix-like action sequences were all one gets to see here ...that and some really bad CGI (harkening back to the days of TRON).<br /><br />The story of vampires and humans battling for supremacy is nothing new to film, too, and it would've been nice to see more character development surrounding Milla's Violet character and that of the main antagonist, Vicecardinum Ferdinand Daxus played by Nick Chinlund. But we just are led to believe that the two hate each other because they're on opposite sides of the human/vampire equation. Or are they? It seems the scriptwriters/filmmakers couldn't make up their minds about that either. What a mess.<br /><br />The story tries to pull a sympathetic chord with the audience by explaining that Violet lost a child in-utero, so when she starts feeling empathy for Six (Cameron Blight), a young boy who carries a virus that can wipe out all vampires (or can he?), we (the audience) are supposed to support her decision not to kill the very child who could kill her. But the emotional impact is nil, again, since almost all of the film time is dedicated to swordplay, killing, and showing us how nice Milla looks in her leathers while decapitating a few hundred bad guys at a time.<br /><br />There have been comparisons made between Ultraviolet and AEON FLUX. I've seen and rated both of these films and found the latter much more entertaining than the former. Although both films had deadly women as their prime protagonists, Aeon Flux actually had a story behind it with some intriguing concepts, while Ultraviolet simply put a futuristic bent on a worn-out theme.</p></br><a href="../users/A4JP4T1F95D0A.html">A4JP4T1F95D0A</a><br/><p>I did like it better than Aeon Flux.  Mostly eye candy, but this movie had better fight scenes.  Basically the movie is set in the late 21st century, a subculture of humans have emerged who have been modified genetically by a vampire-like disease Hemophagia, giving them enhanced powers which creates great fear among the normal people who try to wipe them out. In the middle of this is an infected woman Ultraviolet, who finds herself protecting a 9 year old boy who has been marked for death by the human government.  A lot of special effects and butt kicking, but the story doesn't hold up and is not that satisfying.  If you like straight out action, then maybe give this one a chance.</p></br><a href="../users/A146D2LYLICNLS.html">A146D2LYLICNLS</a><br/><p>I really don't know what to make of this movie. It's kind of like a combination of an ultra-cool eye candy spectacle mixed with the world's worst acid trip. Not that I've ever done acid, but I think this is what it must be like.<br /><br />Comparisons to "Aeon Flux" are inevitable, and the two movies do share a lot in common. Both rely on the sex appeal of the female leads. Both are set in a futuristic metropolis-like world where the heroine must battle all sorts of baddies. Both contain strange looking devices, gadgets and other items only found in this type of film. But I found "Aeon Flux" to be a little more cohesive in its script; "Ultraviolet" goes all over the place with little flow in the plot. And the mind-numbingly bad dialog doesn't help it.<br /><br />But it does have its good points. This has to be one of the coolest-looking movies I've ever seen. Very short on substance, yes, but visually awesome. And what's not to like about Milla Jovovich? Cameron Bright turns in a fairly standard performance as a kid whose only name is Six. Come to think of it, his performance in this movie is pretty much a carbon-copy of his role in "Birth," with that I-know-something-about-you blank stare of his that seems to be becoming his trademark acting style.<br /><br />All in all, "Ultraviolet" isn't a bad movie, nor is it a particularly good one either. But its eye candy makes up for what it lacks in a plot and characters one can care about. Worth seeing on the big screen, but at a matinee price.</p></br><a href="../users/A2P49WD75WHAG5.html">A2P49WD75WHAG5</a><br/><p>Hemo-prefix, blood<br /><br />Phage-suffix, something that eats or destroys.  E.g. bacteriophage.<br /><br />I can't help feel that 11 September has affected moviemaking in presenting commentary on the aftereffects of that tragedy.  In the case of Crash, it was ethnic relations.  Instead of the "war on terrorism," there is a war against viruses and their carriers in Ultraviolet.  A mutated virus infects certain people who are called hemophages.  To maintain the health security of the people, special squads a scientific-oriented equivalent of Homeland Security under the leadership of the villainous Vice Cardinal Daxus, are sent to hunt down and exterminate the hemophages.  Daxus is a stereotypical smarmy cartoonish villain, who has a pair of plugs, or are those filters-through both nostrils.  And the presence of white plastic gloves and his unwrapping guns from sterilized packages make him the posterboy for bacteriophobia.  Interesting too is the shape of Daxus's headquarters, in a cross, like a cathedral, making germ-freedom into a kind of religion.<br /><br />Yet, a small resistance group has formed.  Among them is Violet, or V, a warrior with long jet black hair, glossy midriffed fetish suits of varying colours, a brace of machine guns that look more like staple guns, and a sword with some runes all over the blade.  They're very lethal, yet with the exception of some opponents on a rooftop, many of her opponents die without any blood.  And even without weapons, she is quite the martial artist a la Crouching Tiger.  V, herself once human, until the virus infecting her caused the death of her husband and unborn child-she was pregnant at the time-now hates humans, given how marginalized and persecuted hemophages are.<br /><br />Despite being called hemophages, the only thing remotely similar to vampires is the telltale fangs, which aren't for drinking Transylvanian tea.  Some characteristics of their mutations involve conjuring weapons from their bodies and a superior strength.<br /><br />Assigned by the leader of the hemophage underground leader, Nerva, to steal a secret weapon that if used, would kill all hemophages, and which, if not delivered on time, will self-destruct, V passes herself off as a courier.  When her cover's blown, she takes on several masked and heavily uniformed black and white-suited guards using her weapons.  Yet, when she discovers that the "weapon" is a child named Six, for a reason that becomes clear later in the film, some maternal instincts take over and she flees from Nerva and the rebels, Six in tow.  She has to avoid the hoards of Daxus's armed men, and fortunately gets help from Garth, a fellow hemophage and scientist.<br /><br />Despite the comic book style opening sequence, those into PS/2, XBOX style games, and not DC or Marvel Comics collectors, will probably be the biggest fans of this movie.  Watching the chase scene where V is pursued after leaving Daxus's headquarters, the peppered bulletholes, copters, shiny sides of skyscrapers all make Ultraviolet a video game on the big screen.  And there is a focus on aerial shots, where the however-many assailants surround V in a circle, only to be made digital mincemeat out of them, sometimes set to a pulsing techno score during the fighting or chase scenes, another dynamic of video games.  It's been mentioned along with Tron, itself an 80's movie that computerized its characters.  I'd also add the sci-fi/noir atmosphere of Bladerunner crossed with Minority Report as another comparing factor.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich's action films have a sci-fi bent to them-e.g. The Fifth Element and Resident Evil.  Here, she's a sci-fi guardian of a child, and it's not the acting but her glossy appearance and moves that are the heart of the movie.  So, despite the widespread panning by critics, what's my assessment?  If one concentrates more on its stylistic merits and Jovovich, rather than plot, then it's worth a look.  Those who automatically dismiss it as being another Matrix clone will probably not enjoy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A3VLX5Z090RQ0V.html">A3VLX5Z090RQ0V</a><br/><p>It's Milla Jovovich kicking tail.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JL3A">Yet</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800195175">again</a>, and most likely in the nude at one point.  She plays Violet, a expert killer in middle of a futuristic war between the corporate jerks and the infected jerks she's working with called the Hemophages; she is also a Hemophage, one with the ability change her hair color, control her own gravity, and pulling weapons literally out of thin air (the movie never bothers going into details about those).  Violet was ordered on a mission to apprehend a product, which is actually a boy, and then the woman decided to protect the boy from the people who used to be on her side as well as the corporate jerks who caused her to be infected.  Wait a second...'A female expert assassin had a change-of-heart and wanted to protect a child from people who wanted to kill it or use it?' Oh no, it's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007P0Y7C">Elektra</a> again.  But unlike the necklace girl from that movie, the boy in "Ultraviolet" knew how to keep his mouth and himself out of trouble.<br /><br />The story tended to borderline between nonsensical and stupid.  Stupidity was given by the enemies, who has the tenacity to wear glass as armor and always charging towards Violet, only to hit each other (what is this, Looney Tunes?). The plot holes are plenty in this film, like why does the big baddie need the boy when he mentioned to have clones of the child or how Violet was rescued that one incident in the park when she's surrounded by enemies?  It was such a rush job, even the visual effects were tacky, especially the glossy backgrounds and that one shot when the entire city is made of blocks (not to mention the wall-riding scene that's straight out of "Night Watch").  For what it's worth, "Ultraviolet" served well enough as popcorn entertainment, albeit a forgettable one. It has some decent fights (bloodless for an Unrated version, though), and I did sorta grew fond of Violet and the boy, even though Violet is basically depicted as a mean, hostile woman.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Ultraviolet (Kurt Wimmer, 2006)<br /><br />I had somehow gotten it into my head that Ultraviolet was a stupid American remake of a brilliant British TV miniseries of the same name. After all, they both deal with a war between vampires and humans. The reality of the situation, however, is that had the filmmakers here tried to do a stupid American remake of a brilliant British TV miniseries, the end result, no matter how bad, would have been far better than this plotless mess. As far as I can tell, the script for this was cribbed together by someone who'd watched at least a thousand action movies and thought "wouldn't it be cool to take all the best scenes from all these and put them together in one flick?".  To be fair, they did a pretty good job of that. There are a lot of well-done action scenes to be found here. The problem is that the "story" holding them together is tissue-thin, with characters for whom "cardboard" would be a higher-rent district. And for some reason it bugs the hell out of me that Wimmer, along with all the other movies he's stolen scenes from here, also cannibalized his own work (more than one scene was lifted straight from Equilibrium). The only thing to recommend this is one brief, badly-lit shot of Milla Jovovich's rear end. I'm sure I've seen worse movies this month, but offhand I can't think of one.

The story is basically about a woman named Alice who is basically a renegade vampire chick(Think Underworld, but wierder) who is a member of a resistance of vampires trying to prevent the humans from wiping them out, then it turns out the humans have a weapon; which is a child; which has a substance within him that can wipe out the Hemophages(a.k.a. the vampires) or destroy them. So basically the whole story goes from that. This film has gorgeous computer-generated effects, gorgeous action thrills, an awesome protagonist, and a cool storyline. The only issues I have with this movie is the fact it's more computer-generated than realistic and that people will have a hard time appreciating what an awesome one-of-a kind sci-fi movie this is or liking how strange it is. But I know that this movie will be liked be people who actually like good movies and not that stupid comedy or High School Musical crap.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>While based on a comic book, the opening lines explain all you will know.  This is a word unfamiliar to you.  A disease had been adapted to make better soldiers.  It should have made them faster and stronger.  But it also made them short-lived.  Then the disease got out into the population and a war began between the infected, who were disappeared, and normals.  Violet was one of the infected.  She died.  She was revived.  She is now an almost unstoppable killing machine.<br /><br />Violet has been assigned to capture a new weapon that could wipe out all of the infected.  The weapon is not what it seems and Violet finds herself the protector of a young boy.  For the rest of the movie Violet kills huge numbers of people while trying to find out the truth about the boy.<br /><br />I have not read the comics so I don't know how accurate the movie is.  But without reading the comics I found myself completely lost.  Almost nothing in the movie has any explanation.  As the movie says, this is a world unfamiliar to us.  Unfortunately by the end of the movie we are still unfamiliar with it.  All we really have is characters, factions and other unknowns moving about through lots of action.  The viewer is left with many questions like why is Violet so much better than the others?  During the movie Violet seems to have two personalities.  One is the warrior strong and true.  The other is meek and unsure.  Again, no explanation and the transitions are almost jarring.  If you are familiar with the comic you will probably get a lot more out of this than I did, otherwise there seems very little point to the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A18SDN3HYFVH2L.html">A18SDN3HYFVH2L</a><br/><p>Did I miss the 10-second explanation buried inside this piece of braindead silliness somewhere about how "Flatspace technology" works?  See, that's how heroine Violet (Milla Jovovich, all bare-midriffed and tight-assed and leather-clad) can just suddenly have access to any number of guns or swords that she needs at any instant to kill the dozens or hundreds of similarly-armed bad guys that keep getting thrown at her in nearly every scene in this 87-minutes-too-long film.  Perhaps I also missed the explanation as to how Violet went from seemingly ordinary mother-to-be to unstoppable killing machine in a decade also?  How she fooled the extremely detailed scans of her actual DNA in the beginning of the film that should have kept her from entering a top-secret lab and taking the secret weapon in the humans' war against the hemophages - viral vampires of which she is the most perfect example.<br /><br />Yep, I must have missed all of the backstory, character development, and all sense of what the narrative is supposed to add up to here; or maybe it's all in the extra 6 minutes or whatever in the "Unrated Director's Cut" which (fortunately or not) isn't the version I watched.  Somehow I doubt it.  Somehow I think the entire reason this film exists is to show Milla dressed in a variety of skintight outfits killing literally hundreds and hundreds of bad guys in one heavily CGI-d, lightning-edited, MATRIX-like sequence after another.  Narrative sense, backstory, characterizations - all disposable to director/writer Kurt Wimmer, the man behind the astonishingly highly-rated EQUILIBRIUM, which at least does have a guy who can act when necessary, and a sort of plot to fall back on when the action flags a bit.  That film I thought was a prime example of the poverty of imagination in most American genre filmmaking - and the poverty of expectations in audiences that will lap up the same 50-year-old ideas in film after film as long as there are enough bullets and flying kicks.  Strangely enough ULTRAVIOLET hasn't maintained any kind of reputation, though for my money it's only slightly more inane.<br /><br />Oh, that's not to say that there isn't some slight pretense of a story here if you look hard for it; but most of it is lifted from John Cassavetes' 10 million times better GLORIA (1980) - a badass woman ends up taking care of a little boy who is the key to the bad guys' goals.  In that case, the son of the victims in a mob hit; in this case, a kid who is apparently the "weapon" that will be used against the hemophages (man, even the wordS Wimmer constructs are stupid).  But all that really does is lend a tiny, tiny bit of drama to the proceedings - Violet is so unstoppable that only having a kid to take care of could ever slow her down.  And that's really the problem in a nutshell, narrative-wise - where's the drama when you KNOW that the heroine simply cannot fail?<br /><br />But it's not completely awful (hence the second star).  The film was shot on digital video and it shows, but not always in a bad way.  I rather liked the brightness of the colors and the softness of some scenes, it was at times hard to tell just how much was CGI in a given sequence and the oddness of the Shanghai and Hong Kong architecture, where the film was shot, adds to the visual quality.  And Milla DOES look spectacularly hot.  But overall this is no deeper or more interesting as a story than most videogames, and the aesthetic isn't much different.  If I liked it just a bit more than the similarly braindead MR. AND MRS. SMITH that I watched last week, I guess it's because my expectations were even lower, and the SF milieu is more inherently appealing to me; but really it's on about the same level of inanity.  I guess if that's your bag, and you like the MATRIX films, EQUILIBRIUM, and Michael Bay's style of nonstop action with only the barest of plots, you might like it more than I did.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PPXVR5J6U2JD.html">A3PPXVR5J6U2JD</a><br/><p>My favorite movie, hands down, is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLWN">Equilibrium</a>.  The spiritual successor to The Matrix, Equilibrium had the perfect mix of cinematography, pathos, and action that has rarely been equaled. And the first thing I thought when watching Ultraviolet was..."Wow, this is a terrible imitation of Equilibrium."<br /><br />Equilibrium used its special effects sparingly, cutting away when appropriate, zooming in when necessary, and always remaining focused on relationships despite the nihilistic setting. To my surprise, Kurt Wimmer, director of Equilibrium, also directed Ultraviolet.  Something clearly went horribly awry.<br /><br />The parallels between the two films are striking.  The fabled Gun Kata - a martial art using pistols - is clearly in evidence in Ultraviolet. The same dystopian future plagues humanity, only instead of emotion the authorities suppress hemophages (a cute term for vampires). And just like in Equilibrium, the main character's relationship with children is at the crux of her redemption. And yet Equilibrium is superior to this film in every way.<br /><br />Buried somewhere in Ultraviolet is a parable about fear, misplaced trust, and abuse of authority - all the same themes explored in Equilibrium. The special effects are generally above par, the combat scenes impeccable, and Mila Jovovich (as Violet) is as deadly sleek as ever. But when the CGI clearly doesn't hold up, the camera never looks away.  When combat scenes should be beautiful they become blurry jump-cuts of confusion.  When Violet gets mad, instead of a cold killing machine she comes off as a mumbling thug. Aeon Flux she ain't.<br /><br />Ultraviolet has high ambitions for its comic book "Japanimation" aesthetic, but it fails by simply being all violence all the time. Equilibrium had a similar premise but it pulsed with love, sorrow, and rage.  Conversely, Ultraviolet has the emotion dial set to angry and keeps it there. It's not that the movie is terrible - it simply has no soul.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>Personally, I believe Milla Jovovich is great, even in this because she handles the 'tough' role really well. Cameron Bright also did a good job in his role. In this film I'm going to hold the director entirely responsible for bringing together this mess. `Ultraviolet' is something that I'd expect from Uwe Boll. The film relies completely on CGI and still manages to fall short of expectations. The movie bears some resemblance to `Equilibrium,' like the art of the Gun-Kata and how society is stratified. If you haven't seen `Equilibrium,' you must. It is Kurt Wimmer's greatest movie of all time.<br /><br />On this film Wimmer thought that the pretty colors are supposed to distract us from the incoherent script? It didn't work on this film. `The Sky Captain'-style post-processing just makes everything look blurry. (And why is it applied to only half the shots?) Just about everything in this movie is borrowed from something else, and it's slapped together on the thinnest of premises and tarted up with lots of CGI. When there's a break from the ridiculously-choreographed action sequences, you're bludgeoned with nonsensical subplots and indescribably awful dialogue until the heroine met the villain in their final showdown.<br /><br />Anyways, I think that there is no justification in watching this film, spare yourself the pain and re-watch `The Fifth Element' or any one of the "Resident Evil's" instead.</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>Kurt Wimmer first burst on to the scene with the stylish, dystopic Equilibrium. This little-seen film when it was first released in the theaters soon garnered a cult following once on DVD. What was not to like about Wimmer's directorial debut. It had stylish action, a plot seemningly taken out from an Orwellian playbook and a cast of good to great performances. This sophomore effort from Wimmer got my interest the moment I read about it in the trades. It seemed like a continuation of his take on future dystopia but with a medical twist. I expected alot, though not too much that I overhyped the film to even myself, but what I finally saw once the film hit the theater was something that was a total mess.<br /><br />Ultraviolet takes place in another future dystopia where the world became ruled by a medical establishment that's become religiously fanatical in its quest to protect the world from a plague that genetically-resequenced humans into vampire-like beings called Hemophages. The main character Violet, as played by genre favorite Milla Jovovich, is such a being who is now a member of a dying and hunted species. Violet would've been a cool character if she was abit more fleshed out, so to speak. The character in the film was pretty much indestructible despite the growing odds she had to go up against. I understood from the intro sequence that Ultraviolet was playing on the comic-book style of storytelling and characterization, but Wimmer went overboard in making Violet too Ultra. The story itself doesn't even rise to the level of basic barebones. The ideas presented in the film were still interesting, but it seemed that the audience entered the film sometime during the middle part of the story. So many ideas were being forcefed to the audience through medical mumbo-jumbo that after awhile I just tuned it out. The story pretty much rushed from one talky scene to the next with techno-soundtracked action sequences filling out the gaps.<br /><br />The action looks to have been rehashed from the gunkata of Equilibrium. As much as it would've looked cool in Ultraviolet, the PG-13 rating meant no blood and all the kills done so cleanly or offscreen that one almost thought they were watching something made-for-tv. Kurt Wimmer does know how to create action scenes. One in particular involves Violet on a motorcycle against several helicopter gunships. This was the only scene in the film where I actually enjoyed what I was watching. The soft, dreamlike look of the film even gave the sequence a very surrealistic feel to it. But in the end it wasn't enough to save the film. The rest of the action scenes look to be too choreographed and again the bloodless look to them didn't exactly make them better. Milla Jovovich did look good as Violet and earning a reputation as the premiere female action star, but she could've done and chosen a better project to showcase her talents.<br /><br />Wimmer really regressed alot with this second film, but rumors abound that it might not be all his fault. I don't doubt that talks of the studio getting overly involved in the editing and writing process of the film could've led to the mess that was the fiished product. It's just hard to see how a talented, up-and-coming action director like Wimmer could go from Equilibrium to Ultraviolet in such a short time. Ultraviolet looked like a film that had great intentions when it first began but ended up looking lost and deflated by the time the credits rolled. Here's to hoping that Kurt Wimmer learns from this debacle and goes back to doing what made Equilibrium a cult-fave instead of the stuff he did that made Ultraviolet awful.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>NOTE: This review contains a few spoilers<br /><br />I don't know where to begin, since there are so many things wrong in this movie. I'll start by saying what I DID like. There were some decent moments of music, and there were some nice-looking gadgets here and there. And.....that's it. The rest of Ultraviolet is pure trash from beginning to end. Here's why:<br /><br />-The CGI effects in this movie is appallingly bad. During about 90% percent of the time I was watching this movie, I was annoyed at how unrealistic the chase sequences, the buildings (both inside and outside), and the flying bullets looked. You can really tell when and where they used green screens and.<br /><br />-Every single character in this movie is never interesting and never intriguing. The kid character is a bore. The hemophage rebels are weak and completely forgettable. The main villain, a cardboard cutout at best, does not look dangerous in any way (one reason being a terrible casting choice). And finally, the hero named Violet is dull and unconvincing. Even when she feels conflicted, there is no real sense of dilemma that's conveyed onscreen. It seems more like a stupid excuse for plot progression.<br /><br />-Nearly everybody in the film does a horrid job at acting, especially Milla Jovovich as Violet & Sebastien Andrieu as Nerva. The sole exception is William Fichtner as Garth, who looks like he at least put some effort in his performance.<br /><br />-The dialogue is amazing, but in a very bad way. "You are all gonna die." I'm sorry, what?<br /><br />-Why are the colors in this movie so bright and disjointed? I think I'm having Batman & Robin flashbacks!<br /><br />-The fight sequences are some of the worst that I have ever seen. It's completely tedious, because the main character (Violet) doesn't get hit even once by a bullet nor a sword. She doesn't even get hurt when she crashes into a high-rise building with her motorcycle. There is no real sense of jeopardy, which really ruins any opportunity to create any suspense. In the end, once you've seen how she deals with literally dozens of soldiers, you'll know exactly how the end fight between the hero and the villain turns out.<br /><br />-There are several plot twists in this film, and NONE of them are shocking. Why? Because by this time, there is absolutely nothing in the story that fascinates me in any way.<br /><br />-One of the most overused and most notorious plot points is used in this movie. I just hate it when characters are brought back from the dead: it's getting old and useless.<br /><br />In conclusion, this movie stinks. I couldn't really enjoy watching this mess. There are so many flaws in this movie that I lost count halfway through. It doesn't even pass as a guilty pleasure; that's how bad this movie is. Hard to believe that this cost about $30 Million to make. It should have been spent somewhere else.<br /><br />Grade: 2/10</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Ultraviolet in many ways is like one of those dead-on-arrival films: you know the film's not going to get any box-office so it's best to make a low-budget movie and release and get enough business in those first couple weeks before people realize it sucks and abandons the movie. However, unlike most films that were terrible out of the gate, this movie ultimately does have at least a couple of neat ideas and some cool visuals but it's barely held together by a tiny thread, bad performances, dialogue, CG and a weak story.<br /><br />It's the future and mankind has been partially wiped out by a new virus, turning people into Hemophages. Vampire-teethed with moves out of the Matrix but with a short life-span, they've been looking for the cure for a long time. Their existence is threatened though when a new weapon is revealed and Violet, a kick-butt kind of girl with a weird need to change the color of her hair and clothes frequently, intercepts it. Turns out the weapon is actually a boy with special blood that Violet has to protect while trying to kill those who stand in their way. If it sounds cliche and cheesy to read, it's because it was cheesy and cliche to say.<br /><br />A lot of these movies are obviously geared towards the action junkie type with fast fight choreography which gets hampered by MTV-affected editing like the camera can't sit still for more than 2 seconds. It's a shame though since there's at least some cool ideas here. There's a gravity...thing that doesn't get rid of gravity so much as alter it, allowing Violet to fall through ceilings or walk along them and in one logic-stretching scene, ride a motorcycle across a building before switching gears and riding up it. It's a really cool visual idea(if a bit taken from Episode II and probably some other movie I never saw) where Violet has a sword fight in darkness with the only light coming from their swords that are on fire. Unfortunately the film is just marred by practically everything(except for William Fichtner, seen in films like Armageddon, Perfect Storm or Contact). I can't tell whether this is a double-dip film in the future or they knew the film wasn't going to be a hit so they just put minimal extras. We have a commentary by star Milla Jovovich rather than the director and we have a rather fluffy making-of you've seen everywhere.<br /><br />Should you buy this? I'm going to have to say no. I mean there's enough interesting visuals or scenes to at least warrant a watch but most of the time the movie will just sit there on the shelf and one day you'll go "oh yeah, I forgot I bought this thing...wonder if I can sell it somewhere?"</p></br><a href="../users/APW72P4COWTBK.html">APW72P4COWTBK</a><br/><p>This movie had the chance of being perfect but they WASTE IT!!!!!<br /><br />I only gave it 3 stars because is an anime tribute, is action-packed and the action scenes were SOO COOOOL!!!

Sorry about that if you like this film, but I cannot tell you a lie. Before you dislike my review, let me tell you that I really loved Kurt Wimmer's first film as directo `Equilibrium' and its gun-kata actions. "Silly" some say. Or "Childish." Yes, I know, but I also know that it's great fun. And Christian Bale's gun actions are sensational.<br /><br />But I should be talking about 'Ultraviolet.' Well, `Ultraviolet' starts promisingly. Shot with Sony's high definition camera, the digital touch of the opening sequences perfectly matches the futuristic city and its apocalyptic story about the battle between the two kinds of humans. The first 20 minutes are very good with gadgets and fighting, Sure, many of them look rather ridiculous like gravity-defying motorcycle, but I like the idea precisely because it is ridiculous. And the opening title sequences with the clever use of comic book are brilliant.<br /><br />Then after the secrets about the `secret weapon' are revealed, the film suddenly loses its power. Occasionally the film shows actions, but they at best are mildly interesting. The reason is simple: weakly written characters and inept editing that killed any momentum of the gun/martial actions. The action choreography needs more stylish touch, or at least some originality.<br /><br />Now, let me give you advice. If you have not seen `Equilibrium,' go and get it. Then after watching it, compare it with `Ultraviolet.' You get similar dark, futuristic world, gun actions, and super-cool hero/heroine, but which is really cool? Which editing is superior? And most importantly, which action is more exciting to see? I give you a hint: Christian Bale.<br /><br />Yes, 'Equilibrium' stars Christian Bale who as you know went on to become the Batman. Christopher Nolan's `Batman Begins' proves one thing and that is, to make a good action film, you need an actor who can act, or infuse life into the character s/he plays. `Ultraviolet' has Milla Jovovich who was terrific elsewhere (like Leeloo in `The Fifth Element'), but here she is far from her best. Her character in the Besson film was never boring a single moment while her Violet and her emoting sound completely hollow in `Ultraviolet.'<br /><br />Kurt Wimmer's `Ultraviolet' is a huge disappointment after watching his much better work `Equilibrium.' Familiar phrase is `Rent before you buy it" but in this case perhaps you should rent his debut film before this one. Not perfect fiasco, but still letdown.</p></br><a href="../users/A2LBG01YBSUP96.html">A2LBG01YBSUP96</a><br/><p>milla is a female equivelent of orlando bloom.he has a thing for swash buckling and she has a thing for leather.neither one seems to get it right.you better hurry if you want to see this in a theater because its time is about up.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYOHNGQ1WED1.html">A1CYOHNGQ1WED1</a><br/><p>Every now and then the critics get one right. Ultraviolet is not a movie, but merely an excuse for a lot of CGI effects. What plot there is is so convoluted when you unpack it you won't care because it's contrived and unoriginal. The acting is terrible. Then again, the only thing worse is the dialog the actors are forced to say. All fight scenes in movies are choreographed but the good ones are seamless so you can't tell. The fight scenes in Ultraviolet are a ballet with every move telegraphed so you never believe any of it for a second. I'm sure a lot of money was wasted making this film as was the money I spent to watch it. If you want to watch Milla Jovovich rent The Fifth Element or The Messenger.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO.html">A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO</a><br/><p>I wanted SO much to like Ultraviolet,but it is plagued by poor editing and subplots that are either unfinished or that<br />simply go nowhere.It is all look but no substance.The movie starts with Ultra telling us"I was born into a world,you may not understand".Truer words were never spoken.<br />The story concerns a research organization that alters a virus that has been around for centuries.The intention is to create stronger and faster soldiers;instead they create a contagion.We are told by a voice over by Ultra that she contracted the disease when her husband was killed(blood splattered on her),which in turn killed her unborn infant.As a result she fled underground and formed a resistance.A few scenes later we get our first plot contradiction,as she enters the research facility under the guise of being a courier to pick up a package.She gets the suitcase containing the "weapon" but her cover is blown when the real courier shows up.As she fights her way out security identifies her as one who has been confined to the facility in the past for EXPERIMENTATION and whose pregnancy was PURPOSEFULLY terminated(!?).She was human at one time but is now a hemophage like the rest of the resistance.<br />The movie continues as she heads back to resistance headquarters and at one point stops to look inside the white case she carries.She discovers the "weapon" is a young boy.Her priorities,for some reason we're not privy to,change and she suddenly becomes a protective mother;totally opposite to the character we've so far seen.She spirits the boy away from the resistance leaders and turns to a fellow hemophage by the name of Garth for help.For some reason which again we are not privy to,Ultra needs a blood transfusion and Garth,who has pointy teeth,says it's lucky she didn't "convert" with her light exposure(?).After testing the boy he tells Ultra he doesn't have "vampiral anti-genetic blood"(??);in fact he is useless to them.So Garth is a ...vampire too?While there the boy writes some chemical symbols on a magazine and Garth files it away for future reference(as we shall see).At this point there seems to be some kind of feelings between Garth and Ultra but that sub plot is not furthered in any way.The boy apparently is dying and when Daxus,the head of the research facility,contacts Ultra to get the boy back she finally relents when Daxus reveals he is the father.She takes him to a mall to leave him there but she again cannot bring herself to go through with it but the boy runs away and is caught by her own resistance.She fights and succeeds in freeing him from their grasp.Daxus finally talks Ultra into bringing the boy directly to the research facility and she shows up;but unbeknownst to Daxus,as a hologram.Daxus reveals that the boy really contains an anti-human vuris.The hemophages are no longer a threat to him so he's created a new menace people will line up at his doors to get the antidote for.It doesn't take long for Daxus to realize Ultra is not real but by this time she is long gone with the boy.They end up in a playground where the boy in a short time finally dies.With a teary Ultra kneeling over him,she is killed by Daxus who has followed her via a tracking device in the boy.Next thing we see is Ultra waking up having been revived by Garth.We also now see for the first time that Ultra has vampire teeth!? Garth is also NOW suddenly convinced that the<br />writing the boy did on that mag cover he stashed away,is a cure for the hemophages!? Ultra is not moved as she thinks the boy is still alive.Of course the showdown has to happen between Daxus and Ultra and a battle royale it is.During it we learn that Daxus has hemophage blood also so the fight goes neck in neck until Ultra finally triumphs.She and the boy are united.The boy WAS alive because the hemophage cells in her tears helped to transform him also into a hemophage.<br />I have left alot out but I think you get the general idea.As the movie progresses the plot incongruities make things go from bad to worse as one can easily lose track of what is happening.Characters are doing things from motivations only known to them.<br />The resistance movement lives in a spiral tipped building.They own the first half while a chinese gang,Ultra battles,owns the top portion.And after the battle,how she gets from the rooftop to a street level area with the boy in hand is not explained.Things like this are thrown out at you continually.<br />Even the special effects have their lax moments.During a chase scene on a motorcycle Ultra is travelling first alongside an office building then straight up until she reaches the roof.While she is in midair her image gets shaky which effectively ruins the power of the moment and of the special effect itself.<br />I know nothing of the history or creation of this film but I am certain there was alot of footage that got cut out here and what an obvious hatchet job was done too.It is like a puzzle that not only got reassembled improperly but with pieces missing!Either studio pressure,budget constraints or both got this thing whittled down,but at the price of the integrity of the picture.What a disappointment to such a promising property.<br />For those interested the picture and sound quality are excellent here.The special features contained therein consist of the trailer,a 30 m "UV Protection-The Making of UltraViolet" short and optional commentary to the movie by star Milla Jovovich.<br />Give this one a definite pass.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ALOIPRR8Q06J.html">A1ALOIPRR8Q06J</a><br/><p>Terrible.

In the 2006 flick Ultraviolet, these color tricks are used in every single sequence, indeed in each and every frame. Ultraviolet looks incredible, but ultimately it is just another flash and trash flick.<br /><br />Ultraviolet is a painfully bad mixture of fantastic cinematography and awful acting and direction. The film is basically a bad Matrix ripoff. And the script is just plain bizarre.<br /><br />In the future America depicted in Ultraviolet, there are two different kinds of people. The first group act just like characters from the Matrix movies, including the ability to dodge bullets and the like. They are also at heart vampires, although this aspect of the movie was poorly handled to the point that the vampire bit was confusing. The other group consists of normal everyday folks. Of course, the normal folks are at heart fascists and hate the Matrix types.<br /><br />The level of acting in Ulatraviolet is horrible. You can tell that the actors are in this movie just for the pay checks. They just go through the motions, not even trying to act.<br /><br />This is not the first movie directed by Kurt Wimmer that was basically a ripoff of The Matrix trilogy. He also made the hit Equilibrium. As a director, Wimmer specializes in lots of flashy action sequences. The end result is movies that look cool, but are ultimately empty.<br /><br />The basic problem with Ultraviolet is that its all surface gloss. Ultraviolet has a clear similarity to a somewhat earlier movie, Aeon Flux in that its all flash and trash. Both flicks are basically nothing more than godawful messes of gosh wow and would be cool and wonderful stuff.<br /><br />Only problem is that movies like Ultraviolet are anything but cool.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>What was Milla Jovovich thinking?

And it's no fault of Milla's, whose scenes with the child that she is protecting actually do evoke an emotional response to the parent in me.<br /><br />However, the rest of it is just plain awful, especially down to our nemesis.  At any moment, I expect one of his subordinates to hesitantly cut in, "Sir...ahemmmm...excuse me, sir?  That's not how you wear a nasal strip, sir.  You still snore at night."  Yes, I have a hard time not laughing at the bad guy, especially considering the amount of gratuitous olfactory close-ups that subject us to realizing that there is WIRE MESH on his "nose plugs" which supposedly keep him safe from harm.  Now that it's said, I need to tap the director on the shoulder in order for him to realize that he could still catch airborne illnesses through HIS MOUTH.  (rolls eyes and hammers desk triumphantly).<br /><br />Perhaps it would have been funnier if our "bad guy" had more lines with the letter "s" in it.  "Are you inthane?  How thupid are you?"<br /><br />Admittedly, the action scenes are incredible, but after about 10 minutes, one gets the impression that Violet is so invulnerable that any action scene involving her lacks the suspense to carry the action forward.  Her role is simply to dance around in a circle in a dazzling array of gunfire that takes everyone out and leaves her unscathed.  Somehow, her concern for her well-being seems entirely misplaced given that taking out 20 guys gives her a good workout and a couple stray stands of hair for "injuries."<br /><br />The effects and visuals are also a feast, but there are times it's overdone to the point of annoyance.  The whole scene involving Violet's ever-changing clothes and hair was downright exasperating and the part where the purple sparks dance from eyelid to eyelid almost made me inadvertently laugh--I'm sorry, was this Xanadu?!?  The over-saturated, candy-brilliant colors have been done before, as in "Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow", not to mention others.<br /><br />The film starts off with Milla narrating:  "I come from a world that you may not understand."  The way she reads the line, one can almost hear it coming across apologetically.<br /><br />Give this film a decided, and earnest, MISS.</p></br><a href="../users/A1C2P5HX5RLPAX.html">A1C2P5HX5RLPAX</a><br/><p>I have been a big fan of Milla Jovovich from her [...]kicking days in The Fifth Element so I was looking forward to seeing this flick where she plays the lead, Violet, in a futuristic world where no viruses exist except one.<br /><br />The last surviving virus was human made and causes an early death within twelve years. It also causes an abnormal canine tooth growth causing the virus to be called the vampire virus. It's very contagious and puts the rest of the human population on high alert and forced segregation. Violet is part of an underground team that is fighting back.<br /><br />The movie opens with her on her current mission. Breaking into the dictator's (played by the always exceptionally evil Nick Chinlund) fortress to steal a package. The package contains a child with an antigen and everyone wants to kill him except Violet. With 36 hours left to live she makes it her mission to protect the child.<br /><br />The action scenes are a work of art to witness but more time should have been spent on the storyline development. Cameron Bright (Birth) who plays the cloned boy was really underused and probably too talented for such a minor role. If you want to see a chick kick lots of male [...] to pieces then this is your movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A22TZUXUKA11SQ.html">A22TZUXUKA11SQ</a><br/><p>This movie uses every cliched idea ever about a female action hero who is out for justice.  Why is she so pissed off? She got a disease that turned her into a hemophage (aka not human) and the government killed her baby. What's she going to do about it? Kill all humans.  How? By strutting around in midriff-baring spandex and wielding guns and knives while never breaking a sweat or messing up her hair.<br /><br />It's almost ridiculous how bad this movie is, to the point where it was almost good because I wouldn't have thought you could shove so much garbage into an hour and a half.  Boy was I wrong! Catwoman, Queen of the Damned... not even close. This movie looks like a video game half the time and has so many pauses for effect, I think there's more silence than sound (music not included). And then there's the snappy dialogue.  I mean, with lines like "Killing is what I do. It's what I'm good at," and "You got hemo blood on me. It is on," how could this not be the gem of contemporary vampire cinema.  If you're in the mood for a laugh, you should rent this movie. But if you're in the mood for a decent action movie, look elsewhere.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>Technology in video games is consistently making an effort to look more realistic to game players.  Ultraviolet is a motion picture that seemingly makes an effort to look more like a video game.  I'm sort of indifferent to that direction I suppose, but it's a point I still think is important to make.  Ultraviolet is visually unique and the pace of the film doesn't quit.  You can tell that director Kurt Wimmer (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005JLWN">Equilibrium</a>) doesn't really want us to believe any of this is real as he is striving to create a dystopian world that would exist otherwise only within a comic book or Japanese animation. Ultraviolet does indeed require a vast imagination, but for some of us that's not such a bad thing.<br /><br />Ultraviolet is a chase movie about Violet (Milla Jovovich) who, among many others in her time (in the late 21st century), is infected with a virus that gives her super human powers.  Violet is part of an underground terrorist group that exists to fight against the resident dictatorship.  Soon enough, Violet steals a child (Cameron Bright) from the government and finds out he may be the cure to this disease that allows her to be invincible and be really good at driving a motorcycle.  The terrorist group she is in with decides the child must die and so Violet begins running from everyone with the child.  With some more twists and turns Ultraviolet leads up to a formulaic showdown and more dramatic and unrealistic fight scenes than you could possible imagine.<br /><br />Ultraviolet is an excessive mess.  The fight scenes are perplexing and miserable to watch, not to mention completely unrealistic, which is something I can almost forgive.  Ultraviolet is the ultimate example of over-stylized filmmaking.  In the action genre, the viewer should probably never be aware that a fight scene is choreographed while viewing it, but if a fine line exists between dancing and fighting then Ultraviolet is balancing very carefully upon it and it is doing so right next to Joel Schumacher's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0790732912">Batman & Robin</a>.  The story also seemed jumbled and confusing.  I really wasn't sure what was happening until the very end and even then I had some questions that I wasn't even motivated to have answered.  The dialogue was delivered stoically and isn't very good to begin with.  The music was as distracting as the visuals.  Other than that it was a visually original film and I guess that is where it earns a star for me.  Well, that and Milla's bare bottom.</p></br><a href="../users/A2RKI7RPP5CJMG.html">A2RKI7RPP5CJMG</a><br/><p>When Kurt Wimmer wrote and directed "Equilibrium," he managed to make a wonderful, lower-budget sci-fi flick that had a great story, plenty of action, and solid performances from actors such as the wonderful Christian Bale, Sean Bean, Taye Diggs, and Emily Watson.  When Wimmer cranked out "Ultraviolet," he was given a larger budget, an established action star in Milla Jovovich, and a really creepy kid who is perfect at playing a creepy kid (Cameron Bright).  So what does he do with these seemingly win-win elements?  He goes heavy, VERY heavy, on the action, heavy on the CGI, and tosses the actual acting performances to the wayside.<br /><br />Jovovich, Bright, and underrated character actor William Fichtner (also of "Equilibrium"), have absolutely nothing to work with in this story.  The reed-thin plot is based around Violet (Jovovich), a hemophage who's out to capture a weapon that can supposedly eliminate her kind on Earth.  It seems that every disease in the universe has been wiped out except for one that makes its victims look and act like vampires.  After capturing the weapon, however, Violet begins to question the motives of both her allies and her enemies and all of it sort of smashes along at breakneck speed until there is no one left to kill on the screen.<br /><br />This film wreaks of echoes of "Equilibrium."  From the armed soldiers who explode into powdery shards to the clean white uniforms worn by Violet and others in the flick, it seems as if Wimmer took what he felt were the coolest parts of his cult hit and threw it into this film hoping to cash in on it once again.  Even the gun-kata is tossed in!<br /><br />Visually, this is like a video game gone awry.  There's enough eye candy here to send you into fits.  Bright colors everywhere, chameleon-like outfit changes by Violet, and weapons that appear out of the air.  Wimmer unloaded his bag of visual tricks on this one.<br /><br />There is plenty of action here.  If that's your bag, you'll be right at home with "Ultraviolet."  However, if you enjoy an actual storyline to go along with the explosions and swordplay, I'd suggest you buy "Equilibrium" and leave "Ultraviolet" as a rental only.<br /><br />Not really recommended, unless you really enjoy action and nothing else.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>The story was exciting; the action scenes were gorgeous; the special effects and scenery were lovely. Yes, it was all rather surreal, but that quality was well-maintained throughout the movie and therefore seemed consistent and natural. The thrill of watching the fight scenes, which were obviously designed not to be a gorefest but a sophisticated, synchronized and deadly dance. I recommend this to anyone who likes to see a movie that is beautiful, stunning and also leaves the watcher with something to think about.</p></br><a href="../users/A259F4J3QOBIUH.html">A259F4J3QOBIUH</a><br/><p>Milla Jovovich is another of those actors who inspire me to watch whatever they are in.  She was great in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0800195175">The Fifth Element</a>, and everything else I've seen her in; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YPUFAQ">Resident Evil - The High-Definition Trilogy (Resident Evil/ Resident Evil: Apocalypse/ Resident Evil: Extinction) [Blu-ray</a>].  However this film is not quite as intense as her usual butt kicking flicks.<br /><br />I would not sell my copy, and the cover alone is worth keeping, but I cannot give the film five stars.  I like it, and Milla Jovovich is always sexy but the this is not on par with Resident Evil, etc.  Regardless, you don't see my copy for sale on Amazon.  ;-)</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>I was expecting this movie to be crap. But I think it was really good. I loved the stylish look of the film. It's not at all realistic but then it's not really cartoony either. It's like it exists in it's own world and it looks great. The action scenes were very well done. Not all dumb looking like in Aeon Flux. The one thing I didn't like was the, at times, confusing story. And the fact that this woman was practically invincible. That kind of takes away suspense. But this movie was a lot of fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A36AH31X84FIC8.html">A36AH31X84FIC8</a><br/><p>I Just Watched this film the other day and just loved it. Milla Jovovich yes she is easy on  the eyes she quite lovely, i have to say that i  heard awful reviews about this movie so i did'nt and  go see on the big screen  i wish i would've though this film is total eye candy it's just wonderfully photographed. for those of you expecting  this movie to make a whole alot of sense then i would suggest you throw  your logic brain out the door and enjoy the movie otherwise you'll make yourself crazy because there is little or no plot  just a simple outline of a story and alot of action shooting etc. the  story takes place in  the future as all sci-fi films do this film reminded me matrix and kill bill but not as bloody as bill. it's PG-13 for violence, some lauguage, mild brief nudity in a scene but  you don't see much it's a  backshot so nothing for parents to worry , but all the same parents can screen it before letting their kids see it . But i would recommended this not for young kids ,Only Teens to Adults .</p></br><a href="../users/A30LMTLC9XVWKJ.html">A30LMTLC9XVWKJ</a><br/><p>Get used to it folks, this is the future of action adventure films. Basically a weird mix of "Polar Express" and "Kill Bill 1"; with a plot that seems to have randomly selected script elements from every "Matrix"-like film produced over the past ten years. When "Polar Express was first released, many predicted that the substitution of animation for live action would take over the film industry. But they expected this to be driven from the animation side and not from the live action side. But "Ultraviolet" shows that this takeover is really being driven by the live action production companies. It is a cartoon with occasional cutaways to actors, interactions between actors and animation, and a voice-over narration.<br /><br />Interestingly, not only is this not a new thing, it actually goes back to the days of silent films. In the early 1920's Max and Dave Fleischer introduced a cartoon series called "Out of the Inkwell" which superimposed animated figures on real film backgrounds (allowing a live actor to interact with a cartoon character). Walt Disney (in his pre-Mickey Mouse days ) borrowed the idea for his series of "Alice" cartoons (there were 56 cartoons in the series) and even reversed the idea and superimposed a live actress (Virginia Davis) on an animated background. Obviously these early examples are crude by the standards of "Ultraviolet's" digital effects but the concept itself is identical.<br /><br />"Ultraviolent" is not much of a story but it is decorated with many stunningly beautiful shots of Milla Jovovich as the title character. The story is weaker than the "Underworld" series but on a par with most of vampire-Matrix-post apocalyptic-CGI stuff the industry has been cranking out lately; including Milla's "Resident Evil" movies. The negative criticism of "Ultraviolent" relative to this other garbage is absurd; its all pretty awful but at least here there is an emphasis on the Milla visuals and her costumes are second only to Beckinsale's. They would be just as good if the costumer had realized that flat black presents major contrast problems.<br /><br />Milla can act (see "Dummy") but not much is required in that department for "Ultraviolet".<br /><br />"Ultraviolet" is based on a comic book and the film features loads of lame hyper-edited martial arts scenes that don't require stunt work because they are just microsecond cuts edited together to simulate fighting.<br /><br />"Ultraviolet's" plot revolves around a young boy that Milla is trying to protect. They are caught between a government run by the medical establishment and a resistance movement of disease-enhanced humans. That might sound like "Dark Angel" but instead of a "Bladerunner" production design, think of 1980's "Flash Gordon".<br /><br />All in all, "Ultraviolent" is as good as most of these futuristic exercises in excess and better than some.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</p></br><a href="../users/ACEA95FQS1AVP.html">ACEA95FQS1AVP</a><br/><p>I can't understand how people can say the Resident Evil movies are "edgy and cool," but this gets trashed.  It was a good action flick.  Aeon Flux sucked.  Catwoman sucked.  At least here you see the heroine kick ass, in a tight costume, with hoards of weapons, for MOST of the movie.  And, get this, she actually kills people in this movie--doesn't just knock them unconscious in deference to our violence loving society.  Hopefully the extended cut will offer even more.  What more do you want?</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>This movie had all kinds of creative sci-fi ideas in it, and ultimately, that is what caused the movie to fail.

Get it second hand.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I49HL6XR62DI.html">A3I49HL6XR62DI</a><br/><p>Ultra Violet is an allegory about how a totalitarian regime creates a social class of scapegoats -- in this case, the hemophages or "vampires" -- upon whom it blames all social ills in the relentless, cold quest for absolute political power. Milla Jovovich is intense, stylish and effective and surprisingly touching as the hemophage woman willing to sacrifice everything for a little boy who could be the savior of her diseased people. Visually stunning and highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A35R8PJSEURHHF.html">A35R8PJSEURHHF</a><br/><p>Aeon Flux revisited. Yawn inducing plot...... It is so similar to aeon flux...heroine does mission but during mission the bad guys and good guys become unclear....blah.  Fight scenes consisted of her twirling and dancing around while hundreds of bullets sprayed around her, never hitting her.  She changed hair color for what reason? The annoying mute kid accompanied her through the movie, much like so many other annoying mute kids in movies (the new x-men, etc....) Not worth the time.</p></br><a href="../users/A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ.html">A14Z0Q1DU6CBJJ</a><br/><p>I really wanted to like this more than I did, but the creators missed a lot of opportunities to make a memorable and long lasting film. Ultimately, it falls short of that and lands right in the run of the mill pile.<br /><br />ULTRAVIOLET is NOT a waste of time. It has some phenominal technical moments. Not to mention, some very cool and memorable fight scenes and special effects. Milla Jovovich looks very believable wielding swords and battling hords of attackers. She's also very cool and gives a solid performance. In fact, the entire mood is engaging.<br /><br />So, where does Ultraviolet fall short? There are many things, but I believe the most important thing is that the movie plays like a VIDEO GAME STORY.<br /><br />You may say, "It's supposed to. It's a video game movie." But, turning a video game into a movie is a chance to give a different dimension to a video game character. Video game stories are usually very one dimensional. Find bad guy after fighting through hords and levels of his henchmen and eventually destroy him. That is exactly what you get... the movie plays like levels... and if you've ever heard the term "Hack and Slash". That is what the movie is.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. I love the action. I love the battle scenes. But, it just seems to be one after the other. One immense battle scene after the next, and when it's all said and done.... there wasn't much of a story to be told... just like a video game.<br /><br />Another thing that bugged me was the beginning... the movie has to explain the world... the virus... the new species... the side effects... the war that is raging... and then I noticed... WE'RE ALREADY 10 minutes into the movie!!  Dear lord! Tighten this script up man! Movies should grab you in the first 5 minutes. And then, after the 10 minute explanation... you're thinking, "Is this the second coming of DUNE? Is the movie gonna be that complicated?" And as I've already said... it isn't.<br /><br />This needed more side stories. More emotion. More character building. More essence, more dread and less Milla Jovovich taking on 30 bad guys at a time... 7 or 8 times... or maybe it was more than that. However many it was, it felt like watching SOMEBODY ELSE play a video game after the 2nd time.<br /><br />Maybe it would have been more fun had you been able to control the action with a controller... but ultimately, ULTRAVIOLET sort of falls flat. It's a cool looking movie with a very hip Milla Jovovich giving it her all, but with a very one dimensional story that leaves you with an unfulfilled taste in your mouth when it's all said and done.</p></br></body></html>

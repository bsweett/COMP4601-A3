Whenever a trailer has difficulty in explaining the plot, I lower my expectations.  "When someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage, a curse is born" seems a bit awkward.  The "grip" of a "powerful" rage?  Not a really bad rage?  What exactly is a rage's grip anyway?<br /><br />This challenge, the failure to explain exactly the plot behind the horror, saps the terror from the movie.  I should warn readers now that I'm going to make a lot of comparisons to The Ring, a movie that scared the living crap out of me, because the two have a lot of similarities. We are venturing into Spoilerland.<br /><br />So let's talk about similarities.  Although The Grudge is most certainly not a copy of The Ring, there are enough similarities to make comparisons inevitable. Besides the simplistic titles ("The NOUN, a new Japanese horror, coming to a theater near you!"), both films feature crawling girls with long hair covering their faces, a viral curse, and ghosts that defy the traditional boundary of staying in their respective haunted houses.  The climax is even similar: both heroines struggle to save the male love interest before he too becomes infected.<br /><br />The primary difference between the two films is style. Where The Ring creates a set of rules and then systematically breaks them (or, depending on your perspective, doesn't break them at all but stops reminding you about them), The Grudge isn't encumbered by such rules, to its detriment.  This makes the movie hard to follow. In addition, the scenes unfold out of order, explaining what happened to each victim and thereby illustrating the original murder, Memento style.<br /><br />Here's what I was able to piece together from the deleted scenes: Kayako (Takako Fuji) and Takeo (Takashi Matsuyama) Saeki move into a new home with their son, Toshio (Yuya Ozeki) and his pet cat.  While attending school, Kayako becomes infatuated with Peter Kirk (Bill Pullman), her professor.  When Takeo discovers her many love notes to the professor, he goes on a berserk rage, murdering Kayako, Toshio, and the cat. Then he kills himself.<br /><br />The curse kicks in pretty quickly after that.  Peter discovers something is wrong and visits the house, only to be infected by the curse, which eventually causes him to throw himself off a rooftop.<br /><br />Three years later, Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and her pretty-boy boyfriend Doug (Jason Behr) move to Japan as part of an exchange program.  Karen is a healthcare worker who specializes in taking care of the elderly.  A house now inhabited by the Williams family, including Matthew (William Mapother), his wife Jennifer (Clea DuVall), and Matthew's elderly mother Emma (Grace Zabriskie).  When the regular healthcare worker doesn't show up for work one day, Karen is called in to pick up the slack. She's got a new assignment that just happens to be in that Saeki house...<br /><br />The beauty of The Ring was the development of its characters.  It established people who, when faced with spreading evil or the death of their family, gladly chose the greater evil.  It dove into the complicated relationship between two parents in a modern age who don't know how to be adults, much less parents.  And it peeled away at the voyeuristic core in every one of us, who engages in peeping merely by sitting in a movie theater or watching television...and then punished us for it.<br /><br />The Grudge is not nearly so high-minded. The curse spreads quickly; so quickly, in fact, that I had a vision of the Japanese National Guard being finally called in to stop the madness when two hundred people are found dead at the Sakei house.  Ghosts change form, appear on camera, make weird cat noises, show up seemingly at random, and kill some people quickly but take longer to murder others.<br /><br />I've never been a fan of Gellar, and her performance didn't change my mind. Karen has no spark with Doug on screen, and their relationship is barely fleshed out.  Culture shock is briefly explored in Jennifer's struggle with understanding the Japanese world, but not enough to make us really feel her pain.  Not even Jennifer's relationship with Matthew has any real depth. And Gellar seems way too old to be a giddy exchange student.<br /><br />The only characters that are actually fleshed out are the members of the Sakei family.  The deleted scenes make it clear that we're not witnessing one traditional American ghost haunting, but a ghost house of sorts, which utilizes all four bodies (yes, even the cat), to kill its victims.  And we come to realize that they are all reenacting their deaths over and over, from the croak of Kayako's severed vocal chords to the shriek of Toshio's poor cat.  Unfortunately, critical plot points connecting the first murders with the subsequent deaths were cut, seriously undermining the shuffled scenes. Half the fun is piecing together why the curse took place and connecting the murders to the original event; when you can't make those connections, the film just becomes incoherent.<br /><br />And that's the problem.  With a ghost that can invade your office building, your home, or your bed, we lose all hope that the heroine can even defeat it.  The final solution, that the house must be burned to the ground, doesn't seem like a solution at all.  When the ghost(s) can look like people you know and call you on your cell phone, the evil seems to have such power that we never believe the heroine has a realistic chance of surviving.<br /><br />The movie is still creepy.  After all, Sam Raimi executive produced. The film is beautifully shot with minimal special effects.  The same creepy-crawly stumbling that made Samara so horrifying is in evidence here.  The Grudge also makes use of a multitude of horrible sounds, including the aforementioned caterwauling and death-rattling.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's not enough to really make The Grudge a scary movie for Western audiences.</p></br><a href="../users/A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1.html">A3PQ3K5RKNJYA1</a><br/><p>This was a real surprise movie for me. Having heard this movie mentioned so much, but not knowing the premise is what really caught me off-guard. What a freakin' spooky movie!!!  I loved the way the movie was pieced together after each spooky ocurrance, so that you knew what led up to the demise of each individual; instead of trying to guess. I especially liked the fact that it was made in Japan, and the some of the American actors had to try and communicate in Japanese.<br /><br />Let's see now... cats, attics, cell phones, closets. I think I should try and avoid all those things in the night from now on. What the heck was that noise? What was that little boy doing in my sink?<br /><br />Oh damn! I gotta' shampoo my hair in the morning (check for extra fingers in scalp), and then take the bus to work (look out for reflections in the window) I don't think I'm ever going to sleep in my bed again. That sofa is looking pretty good from here. Aaaaahhhhhhhhh!</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>The Grudge~ Sarah Michelle Gellar is a totally amazing horror movie. This movie freaked me out and I was like shaking with fear when I saw some of the scenes. This movie is just as good as the ring, and the eye. The acting is stupendous and what truly scares you is what you do not see and then your imagination runs totally wild and sets you up for some seriously demented ideas. The special effects are great. I am left with an unsettling feeling in my gut and that is exactly what a good horror movie should do. SMG is amazing in her role as is Bill Pulman in his short part. I highly recommend this movie to people that like horror movies but for the weak of heart this can be a bit too frightening.</p></br><a href="../users/A16IXZW2A0NFR6.html">A16IXZW2A0NFR6</a><br/><p>This movie really does suck. It is a very boring uninspired remake with lackluster acting, zero story, a few moody camera shots that were done much better in Ju-on. This is very much the definition of what sucks in American Cinema today, lets take an overall good foreign film, redo it with an American cast, squeeze out any out the chills and originality and make it a nice boring safe flick for the kiddies.<br /><br />PG-13 is destroying the horror film!<br /><br />Don't buy this tripe don't even watch it unless you're twelve.<br /><br />Watch Ju-on, a genuine horror film with some sincere scares, not this sanitized butt wipe version.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>The Grudge had its share of jumpy moments and freakiness. But the actual story is somewhat dissapointing. People enter and house and get mysteriously killed off one by one. Ok, sounds interesting. But in reality, it was on the slow side. I just couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters, and I think that weakened the movie for me. The premise is interesting, but it just didn't deliver.</p></br><a href="../users/AFV2584U13XP3.html">AFV2584U13XP3</a><br/><p>I felt that with the first grudge movie that at least it followed with the original Ju-on movie somewhat if you watch the first half of the movie follows Karen a caretaker for the mother of an american family in japan who have just moved into the cursed house and the family and what happens to them when the curse starts taking the family. After you see what happens to the family Karen finds out that strange things begin happening to her as she finds out what happened in the house with a previous family (Karen gets a little info from a police detective who was investigating to what happened to both families in the house) she tries to find a way to stop the curse.The first Grudge movie was decent (Definitely Way Better Than Grudge 2) but I say go for the japanese version Ju-On.A lot of people feel that Sarah Michelle Gellar was a great actress in this movie but after seeing her in this I couldn't wait for the grudge to take her out and I really cheered for what happens to her in Grudge 2.That being said for the price of the movie I say is 50/50 if you want good horror and effects this would be ok but if you want good actors and actresses my advice is to look elsewhere..</p></br><a href="../users/AE9GUE3HHOX3U.html">AE9GUE3HHOX3U</a><br/><p>It took me like, 3 days to finally watch the whole movie.  I kept falling asleep or would just shut it down due to boredome.  The story was contrived and dull, it seemed like they just wanted to make a "Ring"-type movie, hoping they could bank off it.  The special effects were totally subpar and this film was NOT scary!!!!!!!!  It was actually funny.  I burst out laughing when the creepy crawly ghost thingies made "scary" noises. I can picture the filmakers getting all excited and caught up "Yeah! this will get 'em, that's sure to freak 'em out!"  NOT. Instead of being disturbing, the frog like groans reminded me of a 10 year old trying to annoy his parents.  Totally lame!  Nothing could save this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>The Grudge has maybe two or three good moments, but they are quick frights and hardly enough to sustain a full length feature.  Reccommended for SMG fans and those afraid of close-ups of young Japanese children.</p></br><a href="../users/A2N69DJM8NVYZ6.html">A2N69DJM8NVYZ6</a><br/><p>I saw this movie at the movie theater with couple of my friend. Since I'm not a horror movie person, I had to close my eyes throughout half of the movie. It's very scary and you don't expect when something scary happens. It's a good movie though and the actors played very well. Just don't watch it alone.</p></br><a href="../users/A356TJCTCLDN89.html">A356TJCTCLDN89</a><br/><p>The Grudge is an interesting little horror film. It's very cool and cerebral and a little dull for long periods and then it wakes you up with a nasty scare. It's not great but it's hardly  the worst movie either. Sarah Michelle Gellar is basically playing Buffy without powers and without the neurosis. She's saddled with a cute but dumb as dirt boyfriend who, like the boyfriend in The Ring turns out to be fairly useless. Since I brought up The Ring I have to say that my first feeling about the Grudge was that it was a Ring rip off. When the ghost comes crawling down the stairs it looks just like Samara Morgan coming out of the TV but after watching a few Japanese horror movies I've come to the conclusion that the ghosts in this particular genre tend be grotesquely misshapen things that creep and have messy hair.<br /><br />The Grudge was okay. I wouldn't buy it and I'm glad I didn't see it in the theaters but it has its moments.</p></br><a href="../users/A22J9WI2PDAVJ.html">A22J9WI2PDAVJ</a><br/><p>"The Grudge (2004)" is based on the Japanese horror film "Ju-on (The Grudge.)" Japanese Director Takashi Shimizu directed both films.<br /><br />"The Grudge (2004)" is filmed with American actors. Bill Pullman, Jason Behr, Clea Duvall (Currently in Carnivale.) and Grace Zabriski were sent off to Tokyo to work with Takashi Shimizu. Sarah Michelle Gellar is used as the cover popularity, recognized name, but plays a supporting part to the haunted house. A never-ending curse is thrust upon this house because of what happened there. Do not step inside this house!<br /><br />Takashi Shimizu utilizes time segments to develop this film into an ending climax. The film starts out in the middle, then procedures to go back and forth from present to past.  I enjoyed this horror film. This film is a break from all special effects movies that Hollywood seems to force upon us. Yes a movie can still be made without them! Was I scared? Sure. The director does take the viewers point of view in mind. I just can't get that scream and little boy creature out of my mind.<br /><br />This horror film takes you back to the old days of filming horror films. No CGI special effects here. Everything you see in the film is real. Okay, I found this out by viewing the bonus features. I strongly recommend viewing the bonus features for filming techniques and technical applications applied. American horror films and Japanese horror films are completely polar opposites. An American haunted house is totally different than a Japanese haunted house. I don't want to give away too much, but the Japanese haunted house is ruthless and relentless.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>Above and beyond all genres of film, horror takes the cake for me.  So when I heard about "The Grudge", how it was yet another version of "The Ring" (which "Ju-On also was), I was prepared to vomit, yes.<br /><br />This went beyond my expectations and had some genuinely frightening moments--no thanks to the lead performances of "who again?" Hollywood nonentities like Sarah Michelle Gellar or Bill Pullman.  Not even frightening moments exactly, frightening sequences, like when Matthew's sister is essentially tortured psychologically till she's sucked under the bed by that blue chick who crawls like she's really angry and really handicapped.<br /><br />This is a scary movie to a considerable degree.  Yeah, it's derivative, and yeah, they use the blue chick too much.  But there are some scary moments, and like the other reviewer said, it beats crap like Seed of Chucky.  Worth a rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BLITJITO97N5.html">A2BLITJITO97N5</a><br/><p>This movie was a big disappointment. I should have learned my lesson years ago that I should ignore the critics and pay attention to moviegoers reviews on online sites. This movie has about two pages of plot which is dragged out for a full length movie. It isn't scary. The creepy atmosphere gets tedious as the plot doesn't move along. The supposedly scary moments are old hat and just get boring with repetition. A loser.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>This is not your usual Horror film, filled with blood and violence. This takes me back to the time where you sat in a dark theater. When you and your date would jump at the same time. And you would see some people covering their eyes, so as not to jump the next time.<br /><br />Yes this movie is a supernatural tale. And it is scary. There is more then one part that will make you jump. And that is what I like about this movie. It can scare you without all the unnecessary violence and blood. The level of expectation is kept up throughout the whole movie. It kept my suspense level almost peaked the entire movie.<br /><br />The story is well written. It gives you time to think. And the horror seems to never end. Just keeps coming and coming...it will keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />I would recommend watching this in a dark room with friends. Those who scream and jump will just add to the suspense for you.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>This movie is like the ring to me. Both were unninteresting and not scary. Besides the shining and certain exceptions, I usually don't get scared during unrealistic horror movies. This one isn't scary, and tries to scare you by randomly showing someone's eye on the screen. That's not what I call scary. The plot centers around a haunted house in Japan, and everyone that enters this house shall die. This is due to some curse and of course when Sarah Michelle Gellar goes inside it, she's got to find a way to save herself. And of course, her boyfriend wants to die too so he goes in also. Just like the boyfriend in the ring. The movie isn't particullarily scart, and if you dissliked the ring like me, you won't like this. But if you liked it, you'll love it. Oh, and by the way, the little boy that makes cat noises (Meowwwww) isn't scary! That's got to be the stupidest thing ever! I found myself laughing every time he'd Meow. Well, anyway, that's all I've got to say.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ.html">A1GSR7RGCG1QYZ</a><br/><p>I will be completely honest with you, I watched this film with my finger on the fast-forward button pressed heavily so that the jumpy scenes wouldn't make me change my pants.  I thought that this was one of the spookiest films that I have seen.  Director Takashi Shimizu has done an excellent job remaking this film for American audiences.  While some will argue that this is nothing more than just corporate Hollywood turning the cranks on audiences' wallets, I thought there was quite a bit of originality to this film.  The institution of us seeing the demon or spirits before the characters do was something that I wasn't familiar with in other horror films.  Normally, there is this big "jumping out of the darkness" scene that frightens everyone because they were not expecting it, but in The Grudge there was this element of "here I am" that frightened me more than most films do.<br /><br />Takashi Shimizu, the mastermind behind this film, also created the original Ju-on series that became extremely popular in Japan.  This allowed his vision and purpose (with a larger budget) to continue.  I enjoyed the fact that the original director was on board and that our American crew was in Japan.  This took me away from the idea that this film was going to be nothing more than just a pro-America horror film.  It took me to this unfamiliar place (building the fear) and showcased the talents of some unfamiliar/familiar American film actors working next to a complete Japanese crew.  I thought that this kept the entire film grounded.  It wasn't set in New York, there wasn't the scene of raw nudity at the beginning ... there wasn't the normal American structure to this film because we were not in America ... we were in Japan.  This really helped me build the excitement and utter terror that I felt while watching this film.  I was impressed.<br /><br />The acting, well, you don't go to a horror film expecting to see Oscar caliber acting.  Gellar and Pullman knew that the horror genre is slowing coming into the limelight as a prominent figure in cinema (it was lacking for a couple of years there) and I think that is why they chose to do this project.  Pullman wasn't anything to write home about, thought I was impressed to see him in this film.  Gellar was the exact same.  She did her part, collected her money, and went home.  This wasn't what frightened me about this film.  I didn't rent this movie to be blown away by the acting.  I expected average acting and that is what I got.  What I did go into this film expecting was to shake, shiver, and be frightened to turn off the lights after the film.  That is exactly what I found. Takashi Shimizu did an excellent job of building that right amount of suspense, using amazing lighting, perfect sound, and some very freaky visuals.  His knowledge and ability to bring us something new was extremely impressive and honest.  Here is a director who was handed the money to make the film that he wanted, and while not everything was probably to his liking, it did open the door for more fans to enjoy his work.  It also opened the door to more projects from his mind to be released.  This could be the new face of cinematic horror, and I cannot wait to see what he has in store for us.<br /><br />Overall, I loved this movie.  It was the exact level of fright that I was looking for.  There were scenes that I never saw coming, there were elements that were unexpected and vividly raw, and it thankfully did not follow the ever-classic Hollywood horror formula.  There was originality and emotion in this film that most horror directors do not give when dabbing in the horror genre.  This was a great story, and I cannot wait to gather friends for a late night horror scream-fest featuring this film.  From the opening scene, to the bus scene, to the opportunistic final moment, I had my finger on the fast-forward and I was scared.  This did what it set out to do for me, and for that I can only praise this film!<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****</p></br><a href="../users/A3R6ST52EBN2FK.html">A3R6ST52EBN2FK</a><br/><p>The cover looks cool and scary so I must warn you.  You CANNOT trust a book or DVD by its cover!!  I'm serious, I do not understand why this movie was supposed to be scary.  I felt like been there done that a million times before.  This movie, despite a strong cast, just didn't do it for me.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>Unlike some of the reviews on here, I loved this movie and was completely caught up in the story.  It is a very effective chiller with a great mystery at it's core.  The direction is well-paced, intelligent, and clever and, in addition, he solicits terrific performances from the principal actors.  The cinematography is perfectly dark and moody.  While this film definitely falls into the traditional haunted house horror genre, it is leaps and bounds above the norm.  The images in this film stay with you much like the ones in "The Ring" (an admittedly better and scarier film).  My wife and I were totally blown away by this film.<br /><br />I admit that I can be rather permissive in what I let my kids watch, but this is one film that in spite of it's PG-13 rating and lack of gore and violence, I would not let them see this film because I know the images would stay with them and frighten them for nights to come.  They love horror films and love being scared and have rarely had nightmares following a spooky film, but I know from past experience that certain kinds of horror films will get to them and since this one got to me and my wife there is no way for them to watch it.<br /><br />This is a truly frightening film and is just as frightening on multiple viewings.</p></br><a href="../users/AAU7CAQIN5BAE.html">AAU7CAQIN5BAE</a><br/><p>As the lights were put out in the apartment and the sweet smells of popcorn emminated from within, the friends all gathered on the floor and couches to finally watch 'The Grudge', all in Hi-Def and PG-13 so the studios can rack in the loot from the kiddie pools, and share moments of sheer terror with each other and rekindle old nostalgia reminiscent of Exorcist, Poltergeist or the like...<br /><br />...a couple of chills<br />...a few laughs<br />...and how completely we were in agreement that Bill Pullman is one of the most wooden, phony, tangibly boring actors in the industry.<br /><br />I don't recall if it was a Dimension Type Film Disaster, if it wasn't it certainly should have been. I mean I understand the idea behind it, but let's make it a little more non predictable. Oh boy at door, oh no shadow going by clouded window, oh my noises in house when no ones around, oh no look in attic... Leave house, go back to house, people dead in house, go back again to house, cops in house, cops that know about previous murders in house, head cop goes back to house, head cop dies in house, other cops go back to house, boyfriend goes to house, Michelle-untalented-Gellar goes to house again, but wait didn't she leave...yes, yes she left, but she isn't in THAT house, but she is, on the stairs but it's not the same house she went into, because she went back in time to the same house that isn't that house she went into originally because it's the house where the first murders took place which by all relative standards is that same house...(phew)<br /><br />Some of the effects were pretty damn brilliant, [scary spectre thingy with tentacles in corner of room et all] but all in all, the masses who say this was scary as heck, is understandable, because you could easily be frightened, I guess. Fun, but not for me. A sure classic for the Myspace generation.<br /><br />Scary: no<br />Fun: sure<br />Should it be in your collection next to The Shining or Something Wicked This Way Comes: absolutely not</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>The Grudge starring Sarah Michelle Gellar is cleverly thought out and insightful. What I enjoyed about this film is the scenery and the elaborate storytelling. People seem to hate The Grudge but I think it is one of the better horror films I have seen in quite some time. There's not blood or guts, just a pure psychological thriller. I highly recommend checking The Grudge out. Too bad Bull Pullman can't pull off a decent performance, oh well.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>Hollywood are rapidly running out of ideas when it comes to new films, and have been remaking Japanese films. This one is all too similar to The Ring, but has some pretty good jump scenes in it. But it's instantly forgettable, and Sarah Michelle Gellar just does not work. It's ridiculous that regular people can't go see the original versions of films, they probably would more, if Hollywood wasn't so determined to remake films, and put American actors in just to make it more viewer friendly. What utter nonsense.<br /><br />The only good thing about this film was the little boy who appears. He is so creepy. I jumped so many times, he's a talented actor for someone so young, and can show so much with just his eyes. It's also very well edited, and is quick enough to make you think "did I just see that?"<br /><br />There's too many of your usual horror movie cliches in this, including looking for something in an attic with only a lighter to light your way and a character following another character that shouldn't or isn't there in the first place. There's also no character development, and it took me a wee while to work out why the character had done what he did in the first place. In fact, I'm still not sure what happened. Most of the characters are severely underused, Bill Pullman & Clea Duvall being the main two, and instead all the focus is on Sarah Michelle Gellar. Who just doesn't work in this kinda role. I know she appeared in many episodes of Buffy, but I've never seen it, so I can't compare. There just wasn't something right. Her face was also very distracting, there's something NOT right with her nose. It's almost like she's been under the knife, cos I don't remember her nose being like that!<br /><br />The timeline just doesn't make any sense to me, there's a couple of different storylines happening, which are linked, but one storyline is going forwards in time, and another is going backwards. Get your head around that one if you will.<br /><br />This isn't an enjoyable film. It starts off with a apparently unexplained suicide, and then carries on. Just pay attention, and be freaked out.</p></br><a href="../users/A3W13VVBRY5GL7.html">A3W13VVBRY5GL7</a><br/><p>I have not seen the original of this movie, so (if the reviews of others are anything to go by), I am lucky to be able to judge this movie without the acclaimed original in my head as a template.<br /><br />And, I am both amazed and happy to report, as a movie in its own right, this version of "The Grudge" more than holds its own against its contemporary horror heavyweights.<br /><br />Starring Sarah Michelle Gellar (in a much smaller role than one would have thought) and a host of forgettable extras (with the exception of Bill Pullman, again in a tiny role), this movie loosely follows the `haunted house' plot of so many horror movies - funny goings-on inspire further investigation, leading to a high-body-count misadventure resulting in closure for our hapless heroine - but since "The Grudge" rehashes this predictable-ish plot with such undeniable style and flair, as well as a few big twists, we don't mind.<br /><br />The first thing that strikes me about this movie is that yes, it is genuinely creepy, with some true-blue shock moments. The jump factor is high, and these shocks and scares (bar the initial dealings with Yoko, the care-worker) never feel tired or predictable. It's thanks directly to the expert direction of Takashi Shimizu that this is the case.<br /><br />Initially, the American Exchange Students-moving-to-Japan plot element feels like a cheat - divisive and base, and a way of moving the action of this remake closer to the tone of the original movie - but happily, an above-average script (for the genre) and a lack of focus on the Westernisation of the lead characters means that this actually works more in the movie's favour. Karen, Doug, the Williams family and the  Kirk family all feel more isolated and alone in their nightmare because of the culture barrier, and not because of some run-of-the-mill horror movie aspects.<br /><br />Visual effects are minimalist and achingly stylish, the scene with the security cameras and the final black-and-white expository flashbacks are some really marvellous examples of what can be established when real talent sits behind the camera, unencumbered by a desire to show off. Affecting and moving, the washed-out colours and ingenious creatures and set-pieces provide a very sympathetic (almost forgiving!) backdrop for some solid, if unstellar, performances from the cast.<br /><br />All in all, this really is an excellent effort, and, when taken in-context with its genre peers (The Ring, Dark Water), it's probably the best of the remakes, too. If `Candyman' was the best horror movie of the Ninties, then `The Grudge' is certainly a contender for that crown now. Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>Despite the $39 million that "The Grudge" earned in its opening weekend to make it the #1 film in the nation, I had low expectations when I popped this DVD in to watch.  This was because my youngest daughter had rushed out to see the film (because it had Sarah Michelle Gellar a.k.a. "Buffy the Vampire" in it) and she was bitterly disappointed.  While I would not trust her opinion as to what is a great movie (she loves "Gone With the Wind" but does not get "The Godfather"), I thought she would know what was a bad horror movie.  Consequently, I think my expectations for "The Grudge" were so low that there was nowhere to go but up once I actually watched it.<br /><br />I knew this 2004 horror film was a remake of the Japanese movie "Ju-on," in the tradition of "Ringu"/"The Ring," but I did not know that it was filmed in Japan by the same director, Takashi Shimizu (I tend to avoid finding out a lot about films until I actually see them so that I be pure of mind when I first watch them).  This makes a big difference because the idea behind this production is behind both the strengths and the weaknesses of "The Grudge" as a film.  However, since I lived in Japan for a couple of years, have enjoyed Japanese films in general and "Spirited Away" in particular, and have an ability to understand non-linear narrative forms, I have to admit that I have a peculiar position from which to view the film (so take what follows with a grain of salt).<br /><br />As the opening of the film explains, "When someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage a curse is born.  The curse gathers in that place of death.  Those who encounter it will be consumed by its fury."  When you listen to the DVD extras you learn that there is another key ingredient: the source of that rage is that the victim does not know why they were murdered.  This is important because this is not your typical American horror movie where the guilty die grizzly deaths.  The innocent are the only items on the menu this time around.  If you want other clear indications that this is a Japanese horror movie then notice that Shimizu goes for the creeps over suspense (guessing who is next to die is never difficult), the camera never lingers on the film's grossest images, and seeing the ghost happens early and often.  The last one presents the most problems in terms of cultural translation because the Japanese conception of demons is so foreign to American audiences (I know, duh, but it is true) as is the idea of a Japanese monster house ("Obakeyashiki").<br /><br />Executive producer Sam Raimi had seen "Ju-on" and came up with the idea of remaking the movie in Japan with the same director but with American actors for an English speaking audience.  So this is not the same thing as splicing in scenes of Raymond Burr to turn "Gojira" into "Godzilla," but it is somewhat pointed in that same direction.  Stephen Susco's screenplay has to come up with reasons why the American actors are working (and dying) in Japan and while he certainly comes up with plausible means of employment, there is an elephant in the living room in that the body count consists mostly of gaijin but that is never a part of the equation.  Granted, Detective Nakagawa (Ryo Ishibashi) is suspicious of the house given what had happened three years earlier, but this film really needed to deal with the gaijin issue better (I was going to say that having more Japanese killed off in the movie would help, but then we have the problem a gaijin being the heroine in a story set in Japan).<br /><br />However, at some point a decision was made for Jeff Betancourt  to edit "The Grudge" in a non-linear fashion.  Now, what they came up with is an interesting approach, but clearly most viewers are not picking up on what is happening right away.  Beginning with the opening deaths before the title credits are over, "The Grudge" follows the first death backwards to the beginning of the tale and the second forward to the ending.  These two plotlines alternate to the climax in which they actually come together.  Unfortunately, this is just way too convenient as the only way that our heroine can understand what is going on.  At a point where the puzzle is coming together we are wondering how this is happening when the focus should be on understanding why everything is happening.<br /><br />Another way in which the production is more interesting than the movie is the limited use of CGI.  Throughout the commentary track, Gellar talks about the lengths to which Japanese filmmakers keep things real.  The shot of the hand coming out of the back of her character's head in the shower is not a CGI shot.  The ghost creepily crawling down the stairs is all the performance of actress Takako Fuji and not a puppet on wires or anything else.  When characters listen to messages on an answering machine, there are actually messages on the answering machine.  But, again, unless you check out the DVD extras you have no way of appreciating the realism of this particular movie.  The more you check out the more you will rethink what is going on in the movie.<br /><br />"The Grudge" is a creepy movie where the ghost is a lot more interesting than Karen the heroine.  But then most of the characters are simply in the wrong place at the wrong time so that bad things can happen to them.  Still, my wife screamed twice and jumped three times while watching this, so it can have the desired effect (at least on those unaccustomed to the way modern horror films work).  More importantly, the attempt to make a Japanese horror movie for Americans, versus an American version of a Japanese horror movie, is worth paying attention to.  Ultimately, I am trying to convince you to watch this movie twice, after checking out all of the DVD features in between.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>WOW.  That's the only thing I can say after reading all sorts of negative reviews.  I admit, the very first time I watched the Grudge with my father NEITHER of us thought the movie was scary at all and couldn't understand its success, but after watching the movie a second time two months later by myself late at night I REALLY began to see how frightening the movie is.  Probably contains the same amount of fear as the original Exorcist, another movie that's really effectively well done.  You HAVE to watch the Exorcist and the Grudge at night to get the proper effect.<br /><br />The Grudge benefits greatly when it comes to maintaining a moody atmosphere and a pretty interesting story.  I say "pretty interesting" because the storyline isn't the best, or the easiest to understand.  Just interesting enough to get the job done.  The Grudge also benefits when it comes to not giving away too much or too little.  In fact, this is probably its strongest point.<br /><br />Every time something scary happens, you see just a "little bit" of that scary monster boy or some kind of strange shadow effect, which is *very* important if you want to effectively scare someone.  If the scary boy had appeared on screen for longer than a few seconds it wouldn't have scared me nearly as much because I would have gotten used to seeing it.  The boy appears, and then he's gone.  Not giving away too much REALLY works with this movie.  You see, to really scare me you simply CAN'T put a scary monster on screen for long periods of time and you HAVE to create a moody atmosphere to make the film believable.  The Grudge works *extremely* well it this area.<br /><br />The fact that something scary happens almost always unexpectedly in the Grudge allows me to give the film another compliment.  I'm telling you, the scene with the woman inside that building by herself (well, except for a security guard) and having to travel home to an apartment building all by herself is about 10 minutes of total bone-chilling excitement.  I *loved* this scene.<br /><br />I was totally on the edge of my seat wondering when the woman was finally going to have something bad happen to her.  The scene where the woman saw darkness coming before walking down the stairs and having to hurry up to get out of there was *awesome*, and the scene a few moments after this happened where she DID see something in the shadow was ANOTHER awesome display of bone-chilling brilliance.  There's a bunch of scenes like this throughout the movie.  Freakin' AWESOME!<br /><br />Excellent pacing and suspense makes the Grudge a true horror classic, in my opinion.  I've seen a thousand horror movies in my time and I'd easily put the Grudge right up there as one of the best.<br /><br />People today have drastically different opinions when it comes to what makes a movie scary.  Remember the good old days when everyone could agree that the Exorcist was the scariest movie of all-time?  I wish everyone agreed that the Grudge is a total classic, and that the Ring is another excellent one.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>At exactly 17 minutes and 45 seconds into "The Grudge," the ever-reliable cat jumps out of a closet and scares somebody.  I tell you this only so that you will know when you will be able to take a quick refreshment and/or restroom break and not miss anything.  It also pretty much underscores the modus operandi of this film, which is "don't bother with something new when something old will do."  For although "The Grudge" is a remake of a recent Japanese film ("Ju-On," made by the same director, Takashi Shimizu), there really isn't anything here that we haven't seen hundreds of times before in haunted house movies made east of the International Date Line.<br /><br />The bland Sarah Michelle Gellar plays a young foreign exchange student living in Japan who volunteers as a care worker in her spare time.  When she is sent to the home of a strangely "lethargic" woman, Gellar begins to suspect that there is something not quite right about the residence.  From then on, she and several other people, who also share a connection with the house, are haunted by a ghoulish specter who keeps popping up in the strangest places and at the most inopportune moments to exact her revenge for being done away with in an untimely manner (although none of the people she pesters had anything to do with her demise).<br /><br />Although there are a few mildly suspenseful moments scattered throughout the film, "The Grudge" is simply too derivative and too hackneyed to register much of an impact on our psyches, with a great deal of its imagery ripped-off from that seminal horror film "Carnival of Souls."  The story makes very little sense when you start to analyze it seriously and, after all the huffing and puffing to arrive at a stunning climax, the ending deflates like a slowly leaking balloon.  I haven't seen the original version, so I have no idea how it compares to this one.  But I can hardly imagine it was anywhere near as undistinguished and lackluster as this one is (or else why remake it?).  Even with the same director at the controls, perhaps something simply got lost in the translation.</p></br><a href="../users/A21B2TJBWCSK1R.html">A21B2TJBWCSK1R</a><br/><p>A lot was riding on Sarah Michelle Gellar's new movie, The Grudge. If it failed at the box office she could be faced with the prospect of more Scooby Doo sequels while its success could lead to bigger and better things. After all, it was her first serious film role after six years on Buffy the Vampire Slayer and proof that she could carry a movie on her name alone. Gellar is smart. She doesn't stray from the genre that made her a star. The financial success of The Grudge surpassed expectations that the studio had for it and a sequel is already in the works.<br /><br />There is a spirited audio commentary by Sam and Ted Raimi, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Rob Tapert, Clea DuVall, Stephen Susco, Jason Behr and KaDee Strickland. Tapert MCs the proceedings, often prompting the participants with questions. Everybody recounts production anecdotes, including working in Japan, getting used to their customs and working with Shimizu.<br /><br />"A Powerful Rage: Behind The Grudge" examines several aspects of the movie and can be viewed in five separate featurettes or altogether. Unlike the original, which used actual locations, the house in this new version existed entirely on a set. The cast also talk about Shimizu's distinctive vision and his working methods.<br /><br />Finally, "Under the Skin" features Dr. Joseph LeDoux, a professor of neural science and psychology. He talks about how fear in horror films work on its audience.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E85KPLPYVW8E.html">A1E85KPLPYVW8E</a><br/><p>I swear, it all started with The Ring, which was based on the Asian horror film Ringu. And now we have The Grudge based on another Asian film, Ju-On: The Grudge. Since The Ring's popularity, Hollywood figures they can widen their horror movie audience by putting out a bunch of PG-13 "scary" movies so more people can go see them and make some bucks doing it, but what Hollywood doesn't really realize is that they are really losing members of their real target audience that made horror films so popular in America. It's really a sad time for the genre right now.<br /><br />The Grudge is another movie to jump on the band wagon of watered down horror/thriller movies (Darkness, White Noise, Boogeyman) that really offers nothing but cheap thrills to people who are easily frightened by simple scare tactics and shock value. And I am not one of those people. What ever happened to the horror movie rule that "if you can't scare them, gross them out with blood and gore"? I was perfectly happy with horror films that lacked in the scare department but made up for it in the blood and guts department.<br /><br />But don't go thinking that the only reason I didn't like this movie was that it didn't have enough violence. I'm just not a person who is easily startled by jumpy scenes, especially in movies like The Grudge. Some of my favorite horror films have little to no gore (Halloween, The Shining, The Blair Witch Project). I like the type of scary movie that gets inside my head and scares me psychologically, not movie's with whimpy ghost popping out of a closet.<br /><br />Other than that, The Grudge offers not too great of acting, almost no plot, and is not scary at all. Enough said here.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ.html">A1BJJVV2B5VLUQ</a><br/><p>I wanted to like this movie. Especially after friends went to see it in the theater and claimed it was one of the scariest movies they'd seen in years. Wow - should be good. Think again. Turned out to be a joke of a horror film - an utter waste of time. Maybe the big screen, the dark theater, being at the late show at night, and perhaps the full moon and high tides had something to do with how they felt about "The Grudge". For me, this movie was slow, predictable, and down-right disappointing. I don't always need blood and guts in my HORROR movies, but sometimes it sure helps. Ask me what I think a classic scary/horror movie is and I'll respond with "The Exercist", "Halloween", "Psycho", "Nightmare On Elm Street", "When A Stranger Calls", "Final Destination", or any of the old classic Vincent Price films from 30-40 years ago. "The Grudge" being an (Asian) horror classic? Give me a break - this kind of innocent suspenseful horror is weak in my book. Watch this movie and tell me your horrified of the little white-faced kid with the shiney black balloon in his mouth. It just wasn't scary! To top it off, director Shimizu felt this movie was so good - he imported half a dozen American actors to make a 2nd (U.S.) version. The first version being "Ju-on"... also a major disappointment. The two movies are 90% the same... with the exception of the American actors. The same house is used, as is the same sister's apartment, the care center, grocery store, elevator, not to mention script and plot. There is no soundtrack to speak of throughout the movie. The director relies on objects jumping in front of the screen at just the right time accompanied by screeching violins. Sarah "Buffy" Michelle Gellar ("Scooby Doo", "Cruel Intentions", "I Know What You Did Last Summer") continues her roll of choosing below average scripts. Bill Pullman ("While You Were Sleeping", "Casper", "Newsies", "Spy Games", "Independence Day", "Lake Placid") on the other hand, is distinguished as a leading 2nd man... and I was disappointed at his role here (very little dialogue and screen time). A long and tedious 91 minutes to get through. I went in with many lofty expectations - and left with none.</p></br><a href="../users/A2D9IEFJGB483Q.html">A2D9IEFJGB483Q</a><br/><p>This film has everything I hate about horror. The manipulative music, the gross-outs, the suspense without the suspension of disbelief, and a lack of an Eternal Cosmic Truth bore me. In fact, most horror has the same message: "Humans are powerless against evil."<br /><br />So we have this infidelity which leads to a curse, and the curse leads to "random acts of violence."  At its core, this is an infection story, similar to communicable vampirism, Night of the Living Dead, or the Borg's assimilation. Consequently, this is a treadmill, or rat-wheel plot: it goes round and round, but goes nowhere.  Buffy Michelle Geller can do nothing to stop the curse. Her best efforts are not enough.<br /><br />Stylistically, however, it's all there. The lighting, framing, and composition are all there.  Retaining the original Japanese setting adds to the eeriness.  We speaking of losing something in translation, but this film adds something in translation. As Merian C. Cooper, of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EHQTZO">King Kong (1933) (Single-Disc Edition)</a> fame, said, "Keep it distant, difficult, and dangerous."  Well done, Rami!</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>In THE GRUDGE a nurse fails to show up for work at the home of an American family living in Tokyo and an American exchange nurse-student, Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is asked to drop by as her replacement.  Karen finds the old lady to be mute and sleeps throughout the day.  Strange events occur in the house and Karen discovers that the building seems to be tainted by a curse caused by a grudge.  Strange events begin to happen and people start dying.  No matter how many victims are killed, The Grudge just won't stop.  It seems that an evil emotion that takes the former of frightening-looking, blue Asian children and a sound that sounds like someone with a chicken bone stuck in their throat just can't be appeased.<br /><br />I watched THE GRUDGE with a group of friends late one night.  Many of them were scared throughout the movie and couldn't go to sleep that night.  Some of my friends didn't find the movie frightening at all, but several days later found that they were having nightmares and couldn't go to sleep.  Japanese horror movies seem to have a psychological effect on some people that lets them experience terror when they would least expect it (I know people who were affected by THE RING the same way).<br /><br />However, I found THE GRUDGE to be one of the silliest, funniest, and most convoluted films that I have seen in a long time.  I busted up laughing during the movie several times and was given strange stares by those around me.  I just didn't find the movie very scary.  Also, unlike some of my friends I didn't wake up days later having nightmares. Instead, I would find myself laughing at inopportune moments as I remembered some of the scenes from the movie.  Most people I have talked to have thought my reactions to the film rather strange, but I have a friend who is a director and though he didn't find the movie to be funny, he did say "it's garbage".<br /><br />There are many who will find the movie quite frightening.  Personally, I recommend it to see the lovely Sarah Michelle Gellar.  She might not be a great actress, but she is attractive.  The film also has Bill Pullman in a supporting role and Pullman is usually a joy to watch on the big screen, too.  Overall, though I didn't find THE GRUDGE very scary at all, I know that many do and it is seeing at least once for Gellar and Pullman's performances.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>this movie to me is spooky.

I'm not talking about Sarah (BUFFY) Michelle Gellar, not this time, but instead I speak today of Grace Zabriskie, the actress who plays the elderly woman who sleeps on the floor and seems so haunted by the violent deaths of everyone she knows.<br /><br />Grace Zabriskie has one of those faces you've seen over and over again, often playing disturbed or Satanic mothers along the lines of Angela Lansbury's character in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE.  Her other forte is playing supportive, rather helpless and pathetic mothers who are nevertheless sweet and loving.  I first became aware of Ms. Zabriskie's sweeping talent while watching the US soap opera of the 1980s, SANTA BARBARA.  She took a nothing part and filled it with every kind of theatrical, filmic gesture, elevating an ordinary show into the kind of thing you would tape every day just on the off chance that she would make an appearance on it.  (That's actually not fair to SB which in many ways was one of the most innovative shows on TV.)  Then my friends who knew I liked Grace Zabriskie would call me and tell me they had spotted her in other shows and films.  She played one of the hardened factory hands in NORMA RAE and she excelled in DRUGSTORE COWBOY.  She was the mother of Laura Palmer in the series of TWIN PEAKS, and she was Debra Winge's mother in AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN.  Need I say more?  For twenty-five years she has been giving us her all, and in THE GRUDGE she gives no quarter to the general shoddiness of the production.  She attacks the part as though she were playing Gertrude in HAMLET (which she is in a way).  Watch her as she turns white, and her struggles for breath, and her anguished pleas to Sarah Michelle Gellar, the co-star with whom she seems to have the most empathy.  If they had an entry for GREATNESS in the dictionary, there would be a little picture of Grace Zabriskie to illustrate the noun.<br /><br />By the way, she is a talented writer too, much more talented than the screenwriters of most of the movies, and she's made almost 100!</p></br><a href="../users/A3R36DZQEWNVJ1.html">A3R36DZQEWNVJ1</a><br/><p>Sarah Michelle Gellar (Tv's Buffy The Vampire Slayer) plays Katherine, a woman who is now taking care of a what looks like a sick woman, played by Grace Zabriskie (R.S.V.P.) Now, as Gellar is putting the woman to sleep, something comes up to the side of her and shocks the hell out of her...it looks like a japanese girl..floating. Then, we get into flashbacks of when the old woman (Zabriskie) bought the house with her daughter, played by Clea DuVall (Identity) and her daughter's husband played by William Mapother (Tv's LOST). Also, Gellar finds out about a man named Peter, played by Bill Pullman (Zero Effect), as she experiences a flashback of him and finds out the secret to why this woman has such a grudge against the people. You either dig it or you dont, is my saying and I dug it to a certain point where it kinda went downhill from there. Director Takashi Shimizu rewrote this story Ju-On: The Grudge which has a lot more effective and better then this one...this one is the neutered hollywood version. Gellar costar's with actor Jason Behr (Tv's Roswell) who worked with her on one episode of Buffy, surprisingly as one of her ex-boyfriends in that episode...here, he plays her boyfriend who goes threw the grudging pains, as I like to call it. Some stuff is creepy, other stuff is kinda gets annoying like the cat meows and the rasping voice on the telephone...even the girl kinda reminds me of the girl from The Ring which blows it off, but she's a Japanese girl...I dont know, maybe the girl from The Ring and the girl from The Grudge should make a movie called Ring Girl and Grudge Girl Take A Holiday. Also starring Ted Raimi (Man with the Screming Brain), who's brother Sam Raimi (Spider-Man 1 and 2) executive produced the film.

However, I think there are a lot of things taken for granted in Japan that Americans don't really understand.<br /><br />So at the end of the movie I was left scratching my head thinking, "What did I just watch?"  I understand how the killings started, so maybe a better question was, "What was the point of this?"  The ending is not an ending at all, but more an opening for a possible sequel.<br /><br />The strongest aspect of this movie was that the bulk of the gore was left to the imagination of the viewer.  You don't see people getting killed, you see it coming and then the rest is up to you.  I think this actually makes it more scary than seeing what actually does happen.<br /><br />The best part is that it lowers the rating from an 'R' rating to a 'PG-13' so more people can see it.  With an 'R' rating, this movie would not have made as much as it actually did.<br /><br />However, if you like a scary movie then go ahead and watch this.  If you don't like them as they keep you up for weeks with nightmares (and you don't want this) then stick with Mary Poppins.

This idea is not new, and many conjecture that what people believe are "ghosts" are in fact leftover energy from just such traumatic events. However, most American audiences want the "wronged parties" or "ghosts" to produce a moral outcome- either the punishment of the murderer(s) or the revelation of how the victims died. What most Americans don't really "get" or appreciate is this malevolent force striking out at random victims- the current occupants of the house, whoever they may be, however transient. This just spawns more innocent victims and seems pointless. On the positive side, the technical elements of the film were excellent, the parts of the film that were supposed to be scary were indeed scary, and the roles were well acted. In fact, for you Buffy fans out there, did you notice that Sarah Michele Gellar was reunited with two BTVS alumni? Jason Behr, who played her love interest, was Billy Ford in "Lie to Me", and the American wife who was caring for her mother-in-law before she was murdered by the "ghosts" was played by the same actress who played Marcie Ross in "Out of Mind Out of Sight" from season one.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>There has to something in Japanese movies that I don't get.

She is temporarily assigned to be a caretaker for a woman with severe sleeping conditions.  The house is plagued by the presence of murderous ghosts, the result of a curse.

It took most of the movie to even find out there was a curse put on the house.<br /><br />Now, my sister-in-law thought it was very scary, so go figure.<br /><br />Personally I was bored and frustrated with this moive and was glad when it was over, but you decide.  To each his own.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Remakes have been done time and time again, let's face it. But it seems kind of rare for a film to actually be re-created by the original director and have almost shot-for-shot imagery from the original. And so it is with the Grudge, an american production shot in Japan with the original director of Ju-On, where the source comes from. While it seems kind of creepy, it was kind of bad bordering on stale.<br /><br />As we're told in the beginning, if a person dies in the grip of a powerful emotion, then it'll bring a curse on whoever comes near and consume them. So in this case, it's a house, anyone who sets foot in a japanese house is basically haunted by these 2 kids: Toshio, a kid who can screech like a cat which borders on irritating than scary and Kayako, a teenage girl who has this weird vocal thing going on.<br /><br />The story is told very non-linear(chronologically) so we start with the death of a character than go to a character's rendezvous with the curse in the house. Then jump into the past for more people. Then back to present and we actually uncover why the curse started and what drove the first character's death and we also get the end of the present's story at the same time.<br /><br />As for the "scares", they're not really that scary. The best scares always comes when it seems like there's nothing on screen then there is. A lot of these you can actually pinpoint before they happen like the attic scare or the under the covers ones. But in a scene that almost seems straight out of the Ring, one of the girls appears in a surveillance video seemingly coming out of the ground. That was more creepy than it's "jumps"(although to be honest, when you see the end of the tape, it got ruined for me).<br /><br />The performances as you can expect are average. Nothing completely inspired but at least they do a good job at getting the images across. Rent it for your date and see if they'll get scared but you'll probably be creeped out less than the date, if they get freaked out at all.</p></br><a href="../users/A20DZX38KRBIT8.html">A20DZX38KRBIT8</a><br/><p>i found this flick to be scary but very hard to follow, and not only that but it was like a bunch of scary ghost clips strung together.

Perhaps that's part of their modus operandi...they come into your home, create a huge mess, and then while your attention is focused on cleaning up the place, that's when they choose to scare the heebie jeebies out of you.  Well, few things, cinematically speaking, scare the heebie jeebies out of me anymore (real life is infinitely more frightening), but I did think this film was, at the very least, entertaining, and provided some spooky visuals and an interesting and fairly simple story.  Co-written and directed by Takashi Shimizu, The Grudge is actually a remake of a Japanese film he did previously titled Ju-on: The Grudge (2003), which I have not seen, so I can't comment or compare without sounding foolish.  Appearing in the film is Sarah Michelle Gellar (I Know What You Did Last Summer)...does anyone else find it slightly pretentious to consistently use all three names?  But I digress...also appearing is Jason Behr ("Dawson's Creek"), William Mapother (Lords of Dogtown), Clea DuVall (Identity), KaDee Strickland (Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid), Grace Zabriskie (Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me), Ted Raimi (Man with the Screaming Brain), Ryo Ishibashi (Dog Star), and Bill Pullman, the guy who played the President of the United States in Roland Emmerich's bloated and flawed science fiction orgasmofest masterpiece Independence Day (1996)...I rip on Emmerich because I think he's one of the worst kinds of filmmakers (load the movie with costly special effects to hide the fact its lacking in everything else, including an actual story) but in a purely visual sense his films can be fun...<br /><br />The film begins with some text telling us that when a really angry person bites during a fit of unprecedented rage, the negative energies stick around, creating some wickedly awesome bad mojo that waits to glom onto unsuspecting individuals who happen to visit the area, thus consuming their juicy and effervescent life force.  Sarah Michelle Gellar plays Karen Davis, an exchange student living in Japan with her boyfriend Doug (Behr) who's quite the hunk with his perfectly tousled hair...you know the style, it's the one that someone spends two hours and a whole lot of money at the hairdressers for to get that `just woke up' look (I get it every morning for free)...anyway, Karen, who's a nurse of sorts, receives an assignment to provide daytime care for a really creepy infirmed elderly woman (Zabriskie) after the mysterious disappearance of the previous caregiver named Yoko...alas, poor Yoko, I knew her not, Horatio, but she was a pretty, young, hello kitty maiden...anyway, Karen arrives at the house, sensing something odd, but goes about performing her chores.  Turns out the crazy lady lives with her son (Mapother) and his wife (DuVall), neither of whom return home, prompting Karen to call her boss (Raimi) as she doesn't want to leave the goony old bat alone...but guess what?  They're not alone...at least not in that house, as it has a violent history, and something was left behind, something in the form of a small, nekkid Japanese boy with a whole lot of eyeliner...and a big mouth...(the evil takes on many forms, but this was the oddest)<br /><br />First of all, does anyone else think William Mapother is kinda creepy?  I'm not talking about his character, but the man himself...his face is all scrunched up and too small for his head, reminding me of one of those angry midgets from the Phantasm movies...well, I suppose I'm no Adonis myself, and he's probably a very kind fellow...as I said before, I enjoyed this film.  It sort of reminded me of a Japanese version of The Amityville Horror, but, instead of Satan moving in and causing all sorts of mischief, we have a nondescript evil entity, the result of a past incident of great anger and violence (the Japanese detective referred to it an `emotional stain'), indiscriminately preying on unsuspecting visitors who happen to enter the abode.  I might be tempted to label this a haunted house story, but that's not entirely true as the malevolent force wasn't confined to the house, but rather latched on to individuals who spent time within the four walls, and subsequently followed them wherever they went until...well, let's just say following them around was by far the least harmful thing it would do...the story was actually pretty simple, but told in a way to make it appear more complicated.  What I mean is instead of proceeding on a linear path, the film is edited in such a way that we see past sequences mixed in with scenes of the present, as they story crosses timeline boundaries, weaving three, connected tales into one.  This kind of thing can get messed up very easily, but here they kept it clean, orderly, and understandable.  The main one involves Sarah Michelle Gellar's character, the second involves the family currently residing in the house, and the third features the family that lived in the house three years past, and the ones responsible for all the stuff going on presently.  Oddly, there seemed to be less focus on the characters and more on the story itself, which may be a result of cultural differences, I'm not sure, but it felt intentional, so I went with it...there are some good scares throughout the film, many the result of something seemingly innocuous in the background coming forth to surprise an unsuspecting audience, along with a few, drawn out sequences designed to create a sense of suspense.  The overall effect for me was a permeating sense of unease, as the evil was clinging to the characters, biding its time.  Overall I thought the cinematography was really beautiful, and I especially liked those long and foreboding shots, as they developed a real sense of tension.  If you're looking for some visceral thrills, you'll probably be disappointed as the blood n' guts factor is minimal, but in terms of a spooky ghost story, the film does very well.  I have only seen the PG-13 version, but there is an R rated directors cut available on DVD, one that features about six or seven minutes of extra footage.<br /><br />The picture on this DVD, presented in widescreen (1.85:1) anamorphic high definition, looks very sharp and clean and the Dolby Digital 5.1 audio comes through very well.  The PG-13 version that I have has a commentary track with producer Sam Raimi, screenwriter Stephen Susco, actors Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ted Raimi, KaDee Strickland, and Jason Behr, along with a couple of others.  It also features a five part, `making of' documentary titled `A Powerful Rage', a featurette titled `Under the Skin' - A medical explanation of fear response in film, along with trailers, one for this film, along with The Forgotten (2004), Guess Who (2005), Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid (2004), Boogeyman (2005), Riding Giants (2004), Spider-Man 2 (2004), Man of the House (2005), and Mirrormask (2005).  The Director's Cut DVD contains a few more extras, so if you are planning on buying this film, keep an eye on which version you're getting, depending on what you're looking for...<br /><br />Cookieman108<br /><br />By the way, did anyone notice how I got through this entire review without mentioning The Ring (2002)?</p></br><a href="../users/A25ACLV5KPB4W.html">A25ACLV5KPB4W</a><br/><p>The violent circumstances of a Japanese family's death have given rise to a curse in which all who enter their old house are stalked and killed by demons representing the dead family. That's not much of a plot, which is why this isn't much of a movie. In scene after scene, we watch a hapless person bumble through an abandoned area, slowly coming to the realization that they are not alone. They all eventually succumb to the fear that envelopes them, and the demons manifest themselves in a variety of creepy ways before dispatching the bumblers. The production values are high, and the scenes are very creepy/scary/disturbing, which is saying something. But any attempt to inject reason or logic into viewing the movie bursts the bubble, and ultimately, there's just not enough to sustain a feature film.</p></br><a href="../users/A329U9CDUPKXAC.html">A329U9CDUPKXAC</a><br/><p>This was a dumb movie.

This, of course, is the American remake of the Japanese horror film, Ju-On, written and directed by Takashi Shimizu. Shimizu also happened to write and direct the American remake; and it shows. Not only because it takes place in Tokyo, but the overall atmosphere and 'feel' to the film. Shimizu didn't try to 'Americanize' his style with this, nor should he. Anyone who has seen alot of Asian horror would recognize the techniques in this film. And chances are, if you've seen alot of Asian horror, you're probably really into it. And if you're into it then you'll probably like this. If you're idea of a good horror movie involves something on the lines of 'Scream', then I can tell you right now that you won't like this. This is not the kind of movie meant for the 'dumb teenager' crowd.</p></br><a href="../users/A1QFQ9SQZVGUK4.html">A1QFQ9SQZVGUK4</a><br/><p>I had great expectations for this film but was sorely disappointed. The story jumps time periods frantically that you never really get attached to the plot. The story is also a bit vague. The actors are poorly cast (sorry SMG) with Grace Zabriskie giving the only inspiring performance (as per usual) as a bed ridden invalid...and that ain't saying much. What was up with the frog noises? How did all these Americans end up in Japan and find such bad luck? The film requires an extreme suspension of disbelief that just leaves the viewer bored.</p></br><a href="../users/A1J66TA573ZPRX.html">A1J66TA573ZPRX</a><br/><p>Not really good but not really bad it was an ok movie.

According to that, I'm the best candidate for the next "Grudge", simply because of the pain and sorrow induced from watching this movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ.html">A2YM3KILJ1G0YJ</a><br/><p>This movie is as pointless as two squirrels screwing in a wool sock.<br /><br />First of all, it's not scary.  Neither the plot nor characters provide any real "horror".  In fact, Toy Story was slightly scarier than The Grudge.  Simply because there are a few shock scenes, in which the main device to shock is a sudden change from very quiet to very loud, does not make a horror movie.  What's more, it sure doesn't make a good horror movie.<br /><br />Sarah Michelle Gellar gives a lifeless performance as the lead.  I suspect that for this abomination of acting she'll be lashed until she drops, never to receive a lead role again in which she doesn't show full frontal nudity.  The only way she'll be investigating any more deaths is in a Scooby Doo sequel.<br /><br />Oh my!  There's a person in the attic.  Wow!  There's a mute, old woman.  Watch out!  There's a little Japanese kid meowing like a cat.  It's simply people walking from one dark room to the next, being confused by whatever nonsense could be imagined without rhyme or reason.<br /><br />It is incomprehensible, boring, lame, and predictable.  If it weren't for the director's well-placed jump scenes, strategically selected to shake-up an entire audience of people in full REM, this movie would be perfect for someone with terrible insomnia.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>Is this movie scary?  In a few places, yes.  However, this movie is more than scary, it is creepy and icky, and breaks the typical American formula for horror movies.  This movie is a matter of style.  If you prefer your horror movies told linearly and your idea of fear is "Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"  then "The Grudge" is likely not for you.  On the other hand, if you like some of Alfred Hitchcock's movies that like to build atmosphere, this movie could well hold your interest.<br /><br />At the beginning of the movie we are told that "When someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage a curse is born.  The curse gathers in that place of death.  Those who encounter it will be consumed by its fury."  Another non-obvious ingredient of this rage is that the person who died does not know why they were murdered.  I was already feeling creepy and the movie had yet to really begin.<br /><br />Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar) has been hired to fill in at a nice house.  It seems that the girl that normally works there has disappeared (which we got to see near the beginning of the movie - one of the "boo!" moments in this movie).  Weird things start happening almost immediately, but the intensity builds and builds, and Karen seems to keep questioning whether what she is seeing is real, but all too soon she realizes that it is all horribly real.<br /><br />What is unusual for a horror film is that the heroine meets ghosts, including the killer ghost, and does not instantly die.  Another unusual characteristic is that the killer ghost is not tied to one location, and seems to wander about buildings will little difficulty.  Also, the ghost was captured on video, though the result of that was disquieting.  The Japanese have learned that it is creepier to have supernatural being make use of modern technology.  Wouldn't it be creepy if your refrigerator started producing blood ice cubes, or a scaly hand formed from the door?  Scary!<br /><br />The director did some things that I think worked well.  Sarah Michelle Gellar is a very strong actress.  However, the director deliberately made her character look weak and tired, and kept Gellar from taking control of the scenes.  The result is that Gellar's fright appears very real, and her manipulation and stalking by the ghost is scarier as a result.  The director also worked hard to tie together flashbacks and current scenes to keep you from thinking about potential problems with the plot.  As long as you remained intellectually engaged with the plot the movie remained creepy and enjoyable.<br /><br />I struggle with modern horror movies.  There is typically (though not always) too much reliance on gore or the hand that "surprisingly" grabs you by the throat.  Unfortunately, after you have seen a few hundred horror movies you know when many of the scary moments come and surprise is harder to obtain.  For example, I found many of the deaths in "Scream 2" very predictable.  Other movies that try to build atmosphere just struggle to make it.  I tried watching "The Others" and found it tedious (which I find annoying because this movie was nicely done, but unfortunately I figured out the ending way too early).  "The Grudge" rarely bothers trying to surprise the audience.  Instead the goal was to create an atmosphere and to keep the suspense level high so that by the time the movie ended your sustained lever of adrenalin would theoretically leave you in a creeped out condition.  However, if you keep waiting for the ghoul to leap out from behind the door and splatter entrails all over the wall, you will most likely be disappointed.<br /><br />I found "The Grudge" to be unique and interesting; probably not as good as "The Ring," but still worth watching.  However, this movie is not a revolutionary breakthrough that will leave you breathless and in awe.  It has the potential to keep you confused and thinking and wondering what might be in your attic or what might be sliding down the stairs the next time you turn the corner.  I know I can no longer think of high rise buildings as being safe havens from vindictive ghosts.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>The Grudge (Takashi Shimizu, 2004)<br /><br />Among die-hard film snobs (like yours truly), the name of Korean producer Roy Lee has become the most loathed in Hollywood virtually overnight. Lee's tremendous success with the remake of The Ring led him to embrace the "if it ain't broke, fix it anyway" philosophy wholeheartedly. A check on his IMDB page shows no fewer than seventeen projects either completed or in production, the majority of them being American remakes of Japanese films (mostly horror, but Hideo Nakata's brilliant mystery Chaos is represented as well). But the bottom line is that if all of Lee's upcoming projects are as well-done as The Ring and The Grudge, folks have nothing at all to worry about.<br /><br />Takashi Shimizu directs the remake of his own Ju-On, translated by Stephen Susco (whose next project is Lucky McKee's adaptation of Jack Ketchum's novel Red, another "can't-wait-to-see-this" movie), and for all intents and purposes, all that was done was replace some of the main actors with Americans. Some of the actors from the original film also reprise their roles here (most notably Takako Fuji as Kayako), while other, better-known Japanese actors dropped into some roles for the remake (most notably Ryo Ishibashi, who gained recognition on this side of the pond as the lead in Takashi Miike's Audition). What you end up with is an above-average cast featuring some actors who really don't get enough exposure in American cinema (Grace Zabriskie, whose role here is understated and chilling in the extreme, for example).<br /><br />Because the original director reprised his role this time, The Grudge bears far more of a resemblance to the original than did The Ring. Still, it bears looking at as its own movie, rather than as a remake, and it is quite a lovely thing to behold-- the horror of the film comes not so much from the events as from the incredible attention to detail and the overall atmosphere of the thing. Definitely worth your time. ****</p></br><a href="../users/A2K3L0DOPQQ697.html">A2K3L0DOPQQ697</a><br/><p>According to The Grudge, there's a Japanese belief that when someone dies in a powerful grip of rage, then a curse is left behind. It's a "stain" that forever becomes a part of the place where the death occurred, and it will kill everything it touches. All I can say is if that were true then the movie-going public better hope I never die in a theater. The audience at this movie was probably the most obnoxious crowd I've ever had the displeasure of watching a movie with. Talk about being in a powerful grip of rage. More on that later.<br /><br />Jump scenes rule the day here. That's right, this baby is stocked with jump scenes! If you're having a hard time deciphering my complicated terminology, then let me explain that a "jump scene" is one in which something startling happens to catch you off guard and makes you jump in your seat. Some people think jump scenes are cheap ploys to get a scare from the audience, but they're really well done in this movie. And they're manufactured frequently and shrewdly enough to keep you in a constant state of unease.<br /><br />Unfortunately, when most moviegoers get scared they like to scream and then laugh and talk about it for 2 minutes afterwards. If you're gonna scream then scream. But then SHUT UP and WATCH THE MOVIE! This ain't a comedy and it certainly isn't a coffeehouse, so quit killin' my atmosphere.<br /><br />Some of you might be a little agitated to know that The Grudge does follow some clich&eacute;d horror movie conventions, such as a character investigating a creepy noise in a dark attic with only a cigarette lighter to illuminate the way. And of course, one character has to slowly follow a strange figure that shouldn't be there in the first place. But it's forgivable. Keep in mind, characters aren't necessarily supposed to know they're in a horror movie. I'm sure we've all explored strange noises before, except rather than a horrific, disfigured ghost producing the noise, in real life the sound is usually coming from Uncle Larry's bathroom excursion. Never underestimate the horror of a night out at the Taco Bell.<br /><br />Comparisons to The Ring are inevitable, so I'll just say that I personally feel The Grudge is the creepier of the two. This is a movie that's heavy on atmosphere and freaky imagery. The Japanese ghosts creeped me out even more than the time I caught some pervert staring at me in the men's bathroom stall back in my college days. Lucky for him, he took off before I had a chance to demonstrate what happens when a person is caught in a powerful grip of rage.<br /><br />But The Ring has the better story and a much better ending. The Grudge does a great job of keeping you guessing. You never really know where it's going, and since the story isn't linear you really have to pay attention. I know a lot of you have the attention span of a goldfish (about 9 seconds, you just learned something today, thank me later), so this may be problematic. I think it works fairly well, but one of my complaints is that near the end everything is wrapped up and explained rather quickly.<br /><br />As a result, I wish the movie had been longer. A longer running time could've produced more in-depth character development, a more clever way to explain what was going on, and maybe even a better ending. And there's my biggest complaint. Why do so many horror movies feel the need to use the I Know What You Did Last Summer-esque "look, there's gonna be a sequel" ending? Come on, how about some closure? It's similar to if you're waiting for me to close out my review in a witty and funny fashion, but instead, for some reason I just decide to end the review in mid sent...<br /><br />THE GIST<br /><br />If you're looking for some Halloween entertainment, then The Grudge will give you some good jumps and surround you with creepy imagery. But I strongly recommend that you see it at a time when there won't be a big crowd because I know I would've enjoyed the movie a lot more had I not been surrounded by a lot of stand-up comedians who felt the need to crack jokes at the most tense and inopportune times. Folks, this is a horror movie. Tension and atmosphere are a big part of it... I look forward to watching the DVD in peace and quiet one day where the only idiots I'll possibly be surrounded by will be friends and family.<br /><br />Rating: 4 (out of 5)</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>I first saw THE GRUDGE in it's initial theatrical form. I didn't find it all that frightening. Of course, I had just seen THE RING, which made THE GRUDGE seem like a clone thereof. Well, I recently watched the extended, director's cut of THE GRUDGE and it is a tad spookier. One thing that puzzles me is why the many deleted scenes were not incorporated into the finished product. Quite a few of them are as scary as anything in the movie! They also add to the overall story in key places. Oh well, at least these scenes are included on the DVD. I recommend this director's cut AND the deleted stuff. Sarah Michelle Gellar is very believable in her role as caregiver, Karen Davis. The rest of the cast is equally good, especially the gal who plays Kayako! When she crawls down those stairs, making that accursed gurgling sound, my body temperature drops 10 degrees! Crikey!...</p></br><a href="../users/A11PTCZ2FM2547.html">A11PTCZ2FM2547</a><br/><p>Horror movies are effective when they're not so. . .horrifying.  Show me a Hamburger Helper gore-fest and I'll get downright bored; there's only so many ways to skin a cat (pardon the pun), plus the viewer, after awhile, becomes completely desensitized to all the blood 'n guts.  There's something to be said about things that go bump in the night; if a scary flick is to be effective, there needs to be suspense, a little campy creepiness, and a fleeting glimpse of a monster screaming, "Boo!"<br /><br />Enter THE GRUDGE, director Takashi Shimizu's American remake of his Japanese thriller, "Ju-on."  I thoroughly enjoyed this yarn precisely because Shimizu didn't try to gross his audience out; instead, we catch glimpses and haunting images of three demons who terrorize a house. . .and anyone who dares to enter it.  Accordingly, actual violence is kept to a minimum; shots of ghosts only last long enough to tweak the "ick" nerve, and the viewer never, ever, witnesses a victim endure a long, agonizing death.<br /><br />And that, folks, makes for effective horror.<br /><br />The mostly American cast is adequate, yet not memorable.  Sarah Michelle Gellar as an American nurse-in-training abroad in Tokyo--and subsequently tormented by messy ghouls--is okay, although she often seems aloof and disinterested.  Other American actors include Bill Pullman, who gets this movie rolling right along.  The ending, like most horror flicks, is pretty lame, yet THE GRUDGE works effectively via creepiness--not chainsaws.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning</p></br><a href="../users/A2DAHERP7HYJGO.html">A2DAHERP7HYJGO</a><br/><p>Let me begin by saying up front that I am a horror fan. Yes I know that this genre is not considered cerebral enough for most reviewers. But it is one that I love and have loved since childhood. Every thing from low budget movies like SQUIRM to high profile items like THE EXORCIST. That being said, it should come as no surprise that after numerous viewings of all things horrific, there is little to see that I would consider actually scary. Until tonight.<br /><br />The story is based around a Japanese legend that when someone dies under brutal or highly emotional circumstances, a curse is placed on that location that carries on to those who visit the site. After witnessing such an occurrence, we are introduced to Karen (Sarah Michelle Geller), a young woman living in Japan with her student boyfriend, who works as a care giver/nurse. Sent to the house where the first young nurse was killed (we know this but no one else does just yet), Karen is exposed to the ghosts that haunt the house, including a small boy and a terrifying lady with long black hair.<br /><br />Her charge found dead along with the couple who own the house, Karen is taken to a hospital. The movie plays fast and loose with moving in time and space to tell its story and it works well this way. We see these victims before they were killed, find out how they came to the house, find out the connection (only slightly at first) between a man who killed himself at the very beginning of the movie and this family and we find out more about the little boy. We are also treated to the grisly deaths of all, including the sister of the couple.<br /><br />It is through the use of storytelling, information that Karen finds online and later a discussion with the police detective assigned to the case, that we garner the whole story. And we learn why this apparition is haunting Karen as well as the rest.<br /><br />No I won't spoil it for you by giving you the ending. Nor will I offer you the times and places in the film where you are likely to jump out of your seat. Instead, just let me say that there are some truly creepy sequences and sights that will make you skin crawl not to mention make you consider the fact that crawling under the covers may never be the safest thing to do ever again.<br /><br />The movie's pace drags momentarily at times, but picks up again enough to make those spots not even noticeable (I wouldn't have mentioned them here but my wife felt that they were too long). What makes this movie work is that along with the scares that it offers, we have a fountain of story that draws us in as well. The acting is solid and the direction by Takashi Shimizu, who directed the original and its sequel, makes him a talent to watch in the future.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Nasty spirits must have a corner on the Japanese housing market. How else to describe the lovely home this evil spirit occupies in "The Grudge"? Sarah Michelle Gellar stars as Karen Davis a nurse living in Japan who provides care for those who require assisted living. This spooky ghost story scared up a hefty profit when it opened. It appears that grudges pay off for director Takashi Shimizu as this is his third or fourth remake of the same film. Luckily, the American remake refines the scares that made the Japanese theatrical hit such a big draw both overseas and even in the US. Keep in mind this is a suspenseful ghost story not a gore fest so don't expect a lot of blood and guts because that's not what this is all about (although it does have its moments). Top notch performances from the cast including Bill Pullman and Sarah Michelle Gellar help create a convincing, tense atmospheric thriller. While this has been Americanized for its audience, Takashi Shimizu's direction remains sharp and he refines his film making it a powerful, spooky thriller,<br /><br /> A top notch transfer from Columbia highlights this terrific DVD. The colors are vivid and bright capturing the lovely, ghostly look of the original theatrical release perfectly. The 5.1 mix uses the format extremely well with nice imaging, sound and depth. The ethereal sound mix perfectly matches the tone and texture of the visual images.<br /><br /> We get a five part documentary on the making of the movie. Sam Raimi (Darkman, Spiderman, Spiderman 2, Evil Dead, A Simple Plan, Army of Darkness) discusses his interest in the film and the cast including Bill Pullman and Sarah Michelle Gellar discuss what drew them to this ghost story. All comment on the stylish direction, the inspiration from Japanese folklore and its impact on the story. Screenwriter Susco discusses how he honed the original Japanese story and repackaged it for an American sensibility without losing what made the original so special. Director Shimizu discusses (via subtitles) how he crafted the story for a very different audience. Covering everything from the Myth of the Ju-On (the power of a woman's rage) to the culture shock the American cast faced making the movie.<br /><br />Under the Skin focuses not on what scares us but why we like to be scared. Joseph LeDoux a psychiatric professor and author discusses how viewing other people being threatened gives us the adrenaline rush that the characters feel without the threat of actual danger. Using footage from the film along with footage of LeDoux, this featurette doesn't tell us something we don't already know but confirms why we react the way we do to horror films, urban myths and stories. We also get a humber of previews from forthcoming Columbia releases.<br /><br />As usual Sam Raimi, Ted Raimi, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Robert Tapert, Clea  DuVall, Kadee Strickland, Stephen Susco all combine their talents for an informative, funny (and occasionally annoying) commentary track. They clearly are having such a good time doing the commentary track that even the annoying moments when they indulge themselves a bit too much are fun to listen to at least the first time.<br /><br />An unusual scary ghost story "The Grudge" will keep you on the edge of your seat. Well made, acted and produced the DVD looks exceptionally good. The extras include a comprehensive documentary on the making of the movie and a featurette on why we like fear in movies (and ghost stories). A great job overall by Columbia, the director, cast, screenwriter and producers Sam Raimi and Robert Tapert.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UX5ABICURKL5.html">A2UX5ABICURKL5</a><br/><p>I like this version alot better than what they showed in the movie theatre,<br />It told the story better.<br />As far as the American version this one was better.<br />I rate this DVD a 4 of 5 stars!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3I69IXPTDVKQF.html">A3I69IXPTDVKQF</a><br/><p>"The Grudge" is the American remake of Japan's "Ju-On: The Grudge", and while it's nowhere near on par with remakes like "Dark Water", "The Ring" or "The Ring Two", it does stand pretty well on its own.  In sharp contrast to the Ring/Ringu situation though (I can't compare the two "Dark Water"s, as I still haven't gotten to the 2002 original), "The Grudge" is pretty much a shot-for-shot remake of "Ju-On", bringing little new to the table.<br /><br />  As with the original, "The Grudge" follows the premise of a legend in Japanese folklore (apparantly really a part of that tradition and not just made up for the movie) - a person who dies an unnatural death, in the grip of a rage, will sometimes become a ghost known as a Ju-On.  These spirits are violent and vengeful and, judging from the "Ju-On" and "Grudge" movies, seem to act not necesarily in accordance with the kinds of people they were when alive, but lashing out quite indiscriminately in rage over the injustice of their own demise.  They seem incapable of differentiating between the living who they would have reason to bear anger against, and just the living in general.  Those who are killed by a Ju-On become one themselves, and the curse grows.<br /><br />  At the risk of repeating myself from when I wrote about "Ju-On" in its own entry, the troubles begin when a young home health care worker (who makes her rounds caring for various frail and incapacitated people in their own homes) enters a house to care for a woman who's recently moved with her family into a new home with a dark past.  Invesigating strange noises coming from upstairs, she discovers an unusual little boy behind a boarded-up wall.  And thus the first Ju-On makes his appearance, and the weirdness and darkness begins.<br /><br />  "The Grudge" has many of the same strengths and many of the same weaknesses as "Ju-On", which is fitting I suppose because most of the time they're the same movie, just with different actors (although some from the original reprise their roles here) and spoken in different languages.  As with the first one, there are some pretty implausible actions and reactions on the parts of the human characters in here; I found it overall to be less pronounced in this remake though.  Although both movies unfold in much the same style with regards to timeframes, I found this one easier to make sense of - it may be because I saw the Japanese one first and knew what to expect this time.  Or it may be because when "Ju-On: The Grudge" was shot, it was with the expectation that most Asian viewers would have already had a chance to see "Ju-On: The Curse 1" and "Ju-On: The Curse 2", the two Japanese made-for-tv-movies which "Ju-On: The Grudge" was itself a remake of (or, apparantly, it could be viewed as a kind of sequel if one was so inclined; I haven't had a chance to watch those two yet).<br /><br />  The overall production values in this movie are very good but the ones in "Ju-On" were a bit better, except for the special effects.  Here "The Grudge" wins out by a fair margin with truly great effects.  Both movies feature the same freakishly disturbing sounds made by the Ju-On ghosrs.  Those bizarre, utterly unnatural noises are just plain scary.<br /><br />  If one was just going on "The Grudge" and "Ju-On" you could really just pick either one and miss very little.  However, there's a catch - both movies's sequels are better, and the sequels actually follow completely different storylines from one another.  And they're each better served by seeing their respective predecessor first.  So personally I'd recommend both "Grudge" and Ju-On", although you'll probably want to watch them some time apart rather than one just a few days after the other.  They're both good movies, but I wish they'd made at least a few significant changes in this one; it's a lost opportunity that was, thankfully, more than made up for by the sequels being so far apart.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RTMB76CJWY9U.html">A3RTMB76CJWY9U</a><br/><p>The Grudge is a horror film remake of a Japanese film. It stars Sarah Michelle Gellar (of BtVS fame) as an American nurse who is charged to watch over a woman in Tokyo. Hijinks ensue, as the house of that woman is home to angry spirits, who track down and kill all those who enter the house. The acting's fine, the direction's fine, etc. Really, the big question that must be asked of a horror film is:<br /><br />Is it scary?<br /><br />Maybe yes and maybe no, depending on what you think of when you think of the word "scary."<br /><br />The Grudge is not scary in the sense that Rosemary's Baby or Whatever Happened to Baby Jane were scary. It's not scary in the same way that Psycho, Alien, Halloween or Scream were scary. It's not even scary the same way the Final Destination movies were scary. It's nothing psychological. It's not the ambience. You won't walk away from the movie looking around corners or afraid to turn out the lights. Instead, the movie is scary because the visuals are disturbing and they jump out at you from out of nowhere, with a crash of music.<br /><br />You see, the special effects/make-up team do a great job at creating scary-looking ghosts to terrify Sarah Michelle Gellar, and when they leap out at you with little warning, you'll get a jolt. It's reflexive, kind of like how you'll flinch if something's thrown at your face. But it's hardly the same kind of terror as the true classics of the genre.<br /><br />Real horror isn't *just* things jumping at you, but it's a sense of how and why they're jumping out; the context. In The Grudge, apparently you're a target because you step foot in the wrong home (where bad things, of course, have happened). After that, you're hunted down by the spirits until they... well... we don't actually know *what* they do. We only know that they look scary, and their victims die in some unspecified way. Why are the spirits able to dispatch some victims quite easily while others resist for some period of time? Don't know. Is there any way of fighting back against the spirits? Don't know. Why did the spirits materialize here, specifically, as opposed to all of the other scenes of violent crimes that pepper our lands? Don't know.<br /><br />Basically, the plot has so many holes, because the plot is unimportant to the film, which holds itself as nothing more than a delivery system for those "jump out at you" moments. Without a real context, you're only scared when the freaky-looking ghosts are on screen; the terror fades as soon as they're gone. While it's scary in a dark theater, it doesn't hold up once you're back out in the sunshine. A fun flick to see once, perhaps, but not something you'll be discussing in 5 years, or really even 5 weeks.<br /><br />Three stars, because it does what it wants to do and is executed well in terms of production values, acting, etc. It wants the last two stars, however, because it's lightweight and horror of the most fleeting kind.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>I knew this 2004 horror film was a remake of the Japanese movie "Ju-on," in the tradition of "Ringu"/"The Ring," but I did not know that it was filmed in Japan by the same director, Takashi Shimizu (I tend to avoid finding out a lot about films until I actually see them so that I be pure of mind when I first watch them). This makes a big difference because the idea behind this production is behind both the strengths and the weaknesses of "The Grudge" as a film. However, since I lived in Japan for a couple of years, have enjoyed Japanese films in general and "Spirited Away" in particular, and have an ability to understand non-linear narrative forms, I have to admit that I have a peculiar position from which to view the film (so take what follows with a grain of salt).<br /><br />As the opening of the film explains, "When someone dies in the grip of a powerful rage a curse is born. The curse gathers in that place of death. Those who encounter it will be consumed by its fury." When you listen to the DVD extras you learn that there is another key ingredient: the source of that rage is that the victim does not know why they were murdered. This is important because this is not your typical American horror movie where the guilty die grizzly deaths. The innocent are the only items on the menu this time around. If you want other clear indications that this is a Japanese horror movie then notice that Shimizu goes for the creeps over suspense (guessing who is next to die is never difficult), the camera never lingers on the film's grossest images, and seeing the ghost happens early and often. The last one presents the most problems in terms of cultural translation because the Japanese conception of demons is so foreign to American audiences (I know, duh, but it is true) as is the idea of a Japanese monster house ("Obakeyashiki").<br /><br />Executive producer Sam Raimi had seen "Ju-on" and came up with the idea of remaking the movie in Japan with the same director but with American actors for an English speaking audience. So this is not the same thing as splicing in scenes of Raymond Burr to turn "Gojira" into "Godzilla," but it is somewhat pointed in that same direction. Stephen Susco's screenplay has to come up with reasons why the American actors are working (and dying) in Japan and while he certainly comes up with plausible means of employment, there is an elephant in the living room in that the body count consists mostly of gaijin but that is never a part of the equation. Granted, Detective Nakagawa (Ryo Ishibashi) is suspicious of the house given what had happened three years earlier, but this film really needed to deal with the gaijin issue better (I was going to say that having more Japanese killed off in the movie would help, but then we have the problem a gaijin being the heroine in a story set in Japan).<br /><br />However, at some point a decision was made for Jeff Betancourt to edit "The Grudge" in a non-linear fashion. Now, what they came up with is an interesting approach, but clearly most viewers are not picking up on what is happening right away. Beginning with the opening deaths before the title credits are over, "The Grudge" follows the first death backwards to the beginning of the tale and the second forward to the ending. These two plotlines alternate to the climax in which they actually come together. Unfortunately, this is just way too convenient as the only way that our heroine can understand what is going on. At a point where the puzzle is coming together we are wondering how this is happening when the focus should be on understanding why everything is happening.<br /><br />Another way in which the production is more interesting than the movie is the limited use of CGI. Throughout the commentary track, Sarah Michelle Gellar talks about the lengths to which Japanese filmmakers keep things real. The shot of the hand coming out of the back of her character's head in the shower is not a CGI shot. The ghost creepily crawling down the stairs is all the performance of actress Takako Fuji and not a puppet on wires or anything else. When characters listen to messages on an answering machine, there are actually messages on the answering machine. But, again, unless you check out the DVD extras you have no way of appreciating the realism of this particular movie. The more you check out the more you will rethink what is going on in the movie.<br /><br />"The Grudge" is a creepy movie where the ghost is a lot more interesting than Karen the heroine. But then most of the characters are simply in the wrong place at the wrong time so that bad things can happen to them. Still, my wife screamed twice and jumped three times while watching this, so it can have the desired effect (at least on those unaccustomed to the way modern horror films work). More importantly, the attempt to make a Japanese horror movie for Americans, versus an American version of a Japanese horror movie, is worth paying attention to. Ultimately, I am trying to convince you to watch this movie twice, after checking out all of the DVD features in between.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IMNZSYDOTTU6.html">A3IMNZSYDOTTU6</a><br/><p>I remember when my mother watched this movie and thought it was one of the worst movies she ever watched. Still, I was tempted to test that idea that this was just a "clunky piece of trash" as my mom called it. I had never really watched many Japanese horror films besides the brilliant AUDITION, so I thought I would give this 'American' version of Ju-On: The Grudge a chance. What was my overall verdict? You'll find out later.<br /><br />At the beginning of the movie we meet Peter, a likable guy who later commits suicide, but for what? We find that out later. Cut to the next frame of the film in which we meet Yoko...a sweet and gentle Japanese girl who is tending to the care of a rather distraught old woman. The woman seems to have a sleeping disorder, so most of the time she is either sleeping or she is awake but silent, never really speaking at all. We do learn why she's in the state later on, and believe me once you see why you too will be scared. Now Yoko is left to clean up the mess in that house (absolutely no one in my home would ever leave a mess like this, and there are several parts in the film when the house is in complete disarray). Yoko suddenly hears a noise in one of the rooms on the upper level of the house, a thumping on the ceiling. As she goes to investigate after opening the door to the attic, she discovers to her terror a ghastly girl (Yuya Ozeki in creepy form like her "Ju-On" role) who attacks her, and the film cuts from there.<br /><br />Next up, we meet Karen and Doug (Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jason Behr), two lovers and students studying abroad who seem very happy. Karen also works to help tend to the care of people much like Yoko was, and after the agency discovers her missing, Karen is placed in lieu of her mysterious departure. Karen goes to the house to to tend to the care of the woman, but she has no idea what she's in store for once she's there. You see, there's a curse on this house, and we don't know it at this point, but a family who lived in that house when through a deadly ordeal. The wife of the previous family had an affair with Peter (Bill Pullman's character, in top form here) and the husband found her out, so in a fit of rage, he drowned his son and murdered his wife before committing suicide. Karen has no idea that these events took place, but she will later. As time goes on, another family descends upon the house led by Jennifer (Clea Duvall, a rather disposable performance - she was better in The Faculty), who is rather depressed. The police are also investigating the disappearance of Yoko and some murders that have taken place, and they discover a jaw in the attic. Throughout the movie, anyone who comes into contact with "the curse" will ultimately be pursued by it until they are killed by its consumption. The moments in the high rise apartment are tense, but the scariest moment of the movie is when one of the agency workers is walking down the stairs and the beaten down Yoko appears, dragging herself towards the stairs going down. When the worker slowly heads in Yoko's direction, he slips on a substance on the floor...her blood. When he asks what happened, she turns around and reveals...oh, but I can't give it away. But let me say this, it scared me when I saw what happened to Yoko. The detective (Ryo Ishibashi) reveals the story behind the "curse" to Karen, and there are many moments in the movie where you will see flashbacks to the events that occured in the house. Later in the movie, Doug, disturbed by what's happened to Karen, who witnessed the "curse" firsthand, decides to go off investigating things in the house on his own. When Karen finds that out, she heads to the house where the climax comes into play. She relives moments of the past in the house, where Peter has come to find the mother hung by her neck and the child scared. Things aren't in a good state as Karen witnesses, but reality comes back into play and the scary girl is after Karen to kill her off.<br /><br />In the final frame of the film, director Takashi Shimizu delivers a nice close. With the body of Doug under covers after his death, Karen goes to his body and sees for herself, but the "curse" seems to have found her and suddenly someone is standing behind her - the "curse" girl who has been tormenting some of the previous contacts and the film cuts with that rasping noise and the girl's creepy eyes. It's bound to make you look forward to next year's The Grudge 2, due out October 26.<br /><br />In the meantime, the director's cut offers 8 minutes of unseen footage, and a plethora of extras. No doubt if you want to see a good remake of a classic Japanese horror film (JU-ON was scary), then THE GRUDGE should ultimately satisfy your appetite. While not a classic in its own merits, THE GRUDGE is the ultimate story of the worst kind of "curse" that could ever be left behind.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>From all the hype I've been hearing since it's release, I would have thought that this was going to be a horrible movie, and I was wrong. This movie isn't half as bad as the majority lead some to believe.<br /><br />The plot was fascinating, even if it is just another haunted house story, it is probably the best haunted house story I have seen and I have seen a lot. I wouldn't go as far as to say that this movie is scary, I didn't think so, but that doesn't mean it wasn't good.<br /><br />I was very surprised on how well Sarah Michelle Gellar did in her role. Very shocked, I thought that this was just going to be another teen horror flick but it was surprisngly fun. It has taken me this long since it's release to watch the movie and I have to say that I wasn't disappointed in what I saw. And after watching the American version of the Ring, I thought I would be.<br /><br />So the moral of the story is that if you are afraid that this movie is going to suck, take a chance and at least watch it when it comes on TV. You may be surprised, just as I was, and end up liking. It taking place in Japan was an added plus. The only flaw was that this was like a Tarantino film, ie, this has flashbacks with no warning given.<br /><br />Overall, good film that should be given a chance, this is not your average teen flick, very mature.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>If you ask whether or not 'The Grudge' is really creepy, yes, it is, but I think horror film fans would find the film as a whole is trying to be too clever.  It features American actors but is set in Japan (directed by Japanese Takashi Shimizu), and moreover throws away the usual chronological order to tell the story, very unusual storytelling method in horror films.<br /><br />With this non-linear approach, the film can be ambitious.  So what you see in the first scene is the most shocking.  You see Bill Pullman staring at the city of Tokyo, from the window of an apartment.  Then, wow, a big surprise comes.<br /><br />Sara Michelle Geller is nominal star of the film, but the real feature is actually the evil power that must be dwelling in the apparently ordinaly small, Japanese-style house in Tokyo.  It is soon revealed that in that place some terrible incidents happen to the visitors, including Ms. Geller's character Karen, American exchange student, or other people (mostly Americans, including Clea Duvall or Jason Behr as Geller's boyfriend).<br /><br />[SURELY CREEPY] The film is surely creepy, and the film comes with the carefully controled sound effects (as in 'The Ringu' or 'Ju-On' the latter being the original version of this film).  The atmosphere of Tokyo is captured very well, and the 'lost' sense of American visitors in this city is presented convincingly.  (Incidentally, you can see the same downtown street of Shinjuku, as was seen in 'Lost in Translation'.)<br /><br />But horror fans would soon realize that director Shimizu uses some conventional scares -- like sudden big noises -- and the film often looks as if too eager to be scary.  In the latter half, the film begins to show its defects -- it is repetitious.  People are killed, or intimidated, by Toshio and Kayako (evil spirits played by the same actors as Japanese versions), but ... it is as if we see too much of them, maybe more than Ms. Geller herself.<br /><br />[IN A NUTSHELL] the problem is this.  In the beginning of the film, you see THE GRUDGE IS THE CURSE OF THE ONE WHO DIES IN THE GRIP OF POWERFUL RAGE. and that curse is, it says PASSED, LIKE A VIRUS, FROM VICTIM TO VICTIM IN AN ENDLESS, GROWING CHAIN OF HORROR.  Yes, it looks endless, in a bad way.<br /><br />Perhaps the film's history is more interesting than the Hollywood remake itself.  The original 'Ju-on' and its sequel (shot at the same time) were made-for-video short films.  Then, two theatrical films were made, AND this Hollywood remake.  The franchize spread like a virus.  And they are planning to make another one.  It's time to stop that, isn't it?</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>Everyone saw the television commercial for this movie and it scared the goosebumps on us.  It must be the quickest release to DVD for a film.  We also remember "The Saw" (2004) advertisement too.<br />  Yoko (Yoko Maki) is a health-care provider to an American woman, Emma (Grace Zabrishie) in Japan who is unable to take care of herself.  Yoko hears something and searches around the house for noise.  She opens a door, similar to a closet and looks around as if it's an attic.  Suddenly something pulls her up and she is gone.<br />  Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is the substitute caregiver to take care of Emma.  She finds Emma in horrible conditions.  After cleaning her up, she too begins to hear noises.  She finds a black cat with one yewllow eye and one green eye and a Japanese boy.  After discovering the cordless phone gone, she sees out the corner of her eye someone walk by the door in Emma's room.  She opens the sliding door and Emma is frightened.  Emma says, "I just want her to leave me alone".  Suddenly frightened again, Karen turns around and sees the most horrifing thing of all.<br />  This movie centers around Emma and people connected to her.  This thing just isn't in this house, but can go to other places too to haunt you.<br />  Also in the cast: Bill Pullman (The Serpent and the Rainbow), Clea DeVall, Kadee Strickland, jason Behr, William Mapother (ABC LOST tv series), Rosa Blasi and Ted Raimi.  Toshio is played by Yuya Ozeki.<br />  Directed by Takashi Shimizu.<br />  DVD includes behind-the-scenes stuff, how nice and specific Director, Takashi Shimizu is and in "Under The Skin", Joseph LeDoux, Ph.d will explain to you why we like to be scared.

It creeped me out and scared me which is why I watch horror movies in the first place.<br /><br />But it was edited in a weird fashion and we all had trouble figuring out what in the heck was going on as it began.  We kept backing up and replaying scenes too.  There was not enough character development.  I wanted to see more of Sarah Michelle Gellar's character "Karen".

It is so funny because all of the buzz I hear is because there are American's in Japan...ummmm...do you think we never move?!  You really never see the "grudges" face besides as a woman who looks simialr to the lady in the ring and as a little boy (who is the scariest part of the movie--he is definately creepy!)  Over-all I was relunctant to see this movie at the theaters because of people either really loving it or hating it so I waited until video and I will say that I liked it for a creepy supsense plot not as a great horror film--as many are trying to make it.

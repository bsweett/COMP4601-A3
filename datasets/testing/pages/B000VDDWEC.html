Love the camera work, each shot carefully composed; the deserted city a landscape not unlike Monument National Park.  Then the music quickens as the lone character strolls through the emptiness; is he really alone?  Even when he meets others, how tenous the relationships?  (Loved how the imagery went from vast to boxed in, chopped up, limiting; the rush up a stairwell.)  This was a cleverly thought out film with many set pieces to lift it out of a well-worn genre.  Trust was a major issue.  Also the gravity of their situation which sometimes they risked by overlooking the obvious; things have changed.  How do you live in a world that wasn't as safe as it was 29 days ago?<br />Very thoughtful, with a few scary bits thrown in (scary, because perception and reality often became confused, and that could get you killed).<br /><br />It's a keeper!</p></br><a href="../users/A1LSDDSM4PGOU5.html">A1LSDDSM4PGOU5</a><br/><p>28 days later is a well made film.it has good performances from its<br />main actors,it is suspenseful,and there are some scary moments.the<br />director maintains tension throughout the movie.the make up effects in<br />the film are very well done,so that the infected look much less than<br />human,quite horrifying in fact.the action sequences are well done as<br />are the dramatic moments.this a not a zombie movie per Se,but a movie<br />about human relations and interaction in the face of what seems like<br />hopelessness.the most horrifying thing in the movie is its<br />premise,which is: plague has spread throughout the land,infecting<br />people and turning them into animalistic creatures,not quite<br />zombies,but not human either and having no thought other than attacking<br />and infecting the uninfected.it shows the desperation that some people<br />are willing to go through to survive.i won't give away any specifics of<br />the plot.anyway,for me,this is a well crafted movie all around.it is a<br />deep movie with a message and it asks some very scary questions.highly<br />recommended 4/5</p></br><a href="../users/AR1T36GLLAFFX.html">AR1T36GLLAFFX</a><br/><p>I guess I would have considered this a 'zombie' movie, since the bad guys are not at all nice, and have definite problems (to say the least).  But it isn't a zombie movie, since zombies are the dead, come back to life.  The vicious killers in this excellent film are actually living, breathing, normal folks who happen to get rapidly infected with the 'Rage virus'.<br /><br />I say that 28 Days Later is a ground-breaking film because it is such a departure from the 'Night of the Living Dead'-type of film, where the zombies are slow-moving, but relentless creatures with a taste for human flesh.  In 28 Days, the unfriendlies are angry, very angry, and they act out their most violet impulses on any human within grabbing distance.  These guys are FAST and terribly violent, and if you get a drop of blood in your eye, or in a cut, or breath in the virus particles, it's pretty much all over.  (Pretty much?  No, it's really ALL OVER, and you are going to act like Jack the Ripper on a very bad day.  28 Days is a smartly done thriller with tremendous tension that keeps your heart pounding the whole movie.<br /><br />The film is well photographed and the Rage Victims are truly terrifying.  The don't shuffle along at a speed a snail could outrun, but the are fast and lightning-quick.  And they have one desire...to kill you.<br /><br />(Of course no virus will take over your brain in, like, 10 seconds.  They need to replicate many generations to do their damage.  That's why you don't get a cold instantly when someone sneezes in your face.  Oh, by the way, make sure the sneezer doesn't have...the Rage Virus!)<br /><br />The cinematography in this film is excellent.  It gives the film-goer a sense of loneliness, fear, affection, struggle and eventual survival (for some of the characters).  I suppose the only criticism would be that the virus can infect a person in 10-15 seconds, which is impossible.  But it does make it handy to tell if someone is infected.  If they go crazy and try to kill you, they are infected!<br /><br />Highly recommended.  But be forewarned, this is often very bloody, very gruesome, and very graphic. This one will bear repeat viewing.  It's a must see.</p></br><a href="../users/A2J57EQ9KPGXR9.html">A2J57EQ9KPGXR9</a><br/><p>As a horror film, &quot;28 Days Later&quot; is only so-so. Its not that scary, the &quot;zombies&quot; do alot of chasing but no flesh eating; there made for TV movies that are scarier than this film. However, there are some genuinely tense moments in this movie and the acting and general plotline are very good. <p>Don't buy into the &quot;alternate ending&quot; hype, its not worth getting the DVD just for that.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP.html">A2TZKXU6Q0EDNP</a><br/><p>This is actually a line of graffitti written on the wall of some church as depicted in the film.<br />  "28 days later" is overall a great horror film and quite possibly a classic in its genre even though it treads already stepped on ground it still has enough originality and verve in it to bring it through.<p>  As a man wakes up from a coma after a month only to find out that humans have been almost wiped out by a deadly "rage virus" that makes its victims extremely aggressive and murderous a story of ultra doom unfolds filmed masterfully by Doyle (Trainspotting).<br />  The scenes where the protagonist walks about in a deserted London where cars have been abandoned in the middle of the streets and there's no soul to be seen anywhere while screaming "helloooooo" are second to none when it comes to depicting catastrophe on celluloid.<br />  Eventually, and after being attacked by raging zombies, he figures out that while he was comatose the world has turned into an arena of murder induced by the virus. Understanding the extreme danger he's under he teams up with other non-infected survivors and they try to figure out what to do but in the mode of a blind man searching for something which he doesn't know what it looks like.<br />  The ened of the film dissapoints somewhat as the few survivors become prisoners of a near-psychosis-army-major and his few men who've set barracks somewhere in the countryside and gets further spoiled as the final scene emits out of the blue hope when the entire film actually works in showing there's no such possibility. Pity because those last 20 seconds of the closing scene are enough to take the film off its course. An ultra doom-end would not only have been very appropriate but the scenario indeed screams for an ending that leaves no hope and no light at the end of any tunnel.<p>  Strangely enough, for those that've read Stephen King's "the stand" a lot of the scenes and ideas incorporated here seem to be lifted straight off that book. They fit like a glove of course but I wonder how much of the script was inspired of that novel.<br />  Cinematically speaking it's strikingly obvious that Boyle pays hommage to classic horror directors like Romero and Carpenter. The raging zombie theme has Romero written all over it and the excellent soundtrack reminds immediately of Carpenter as does the sequence with the survivors being emprisoned in the army barracks while under literal siege which reminisces of "Assault on precinct 13"..<p>  Beautiful camera work, beautiful directing, incredible photography, brilliant soundtrack only marred by the ending of the film which should have been avoided. All the -outside Britain- actors are giving excellent performances (esp. the main character as well as the army major) and exactly the fact that they are not known faces helps make the film more believable.<br />  Along with Donnie Darko (dont miss it if you havent seen it)28 days later are easily the top indie films of last year not to metnion of the last 5 years.<br />  Great stuff and a welcome return to classic horror themes for lovers of the genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A2CT2SA6KFE8GC.html">A2CT2SA6KFE8GC</a><br/><p>I'm glad to see this kind of movie given a decent budget and put in major theater chains.  In a time when I Know What You Did Last Summer, Scream and The Sixth Sense are thought of as "horror" films, it's pleasing to see an honest, back-to-basics horror film like this.  The only other one this year being House Of 1000 Corpses.  This movie has it's shortcomings, but I like the effort.  This movie's basically a Frankenstein-type movie in the sense that it's made up of pieces and ideas(sometimes whole scenes!) from other "last people on earth" horror movies.  There are pieces of Dead Alive, Night/Dawn/Day Of The Dead, The Stand, The Quiet Earth, Demons, The Crazies and the Resident Evil game to name a few.  Yes, we all know that a guy wakes up from a coma to realize that he's left in a city of living dead monsters.  He teams up with a few other survivors, ends up at a mansion with some soldiers, tra-la, tra-la.  Naturally, these military guys have a sinister agenda, but that's not much of a surprise coz the military ALWAYS does in this kind of film.  The "zombies" aren't the Romero ones you're used to, they don't even eat anyone really.  They're infected with rage, so they like to beat, claw, stomp, strangle, puke up blood, etc.  They actually look and act alot like the demons from Lamberto Bava's Demons films(minus the claws and fangs of course).  I have three main gripes with this: 1)  The streets aren't cluttered with cars like they should be(with the exception of the tunnel).  A massacre like this would leave abandoned cars all over the city, but I guess the zombies moved them or something, coz our heroes have a clear path everywhere they drive.  2).  I don't care what anyone says, but a happy ending in this kind of film leaves a real bad taste in my mouth.  3)  It's a little more flashy and stylish than this kind of film should be.  Is it scary?  Depends on how many of the aforementioned films you've seen.  The "scares" here consist of zombies suddenly crashing through windows or doors, making the audience mess their trousers and leaving them looking around to see if anyone saw them jump.  That's about as scary as it gets if you're fluent in zombie flicks.  If you're not, it can go either way.  I've heard people say it's very scary and others say it's dumb, so I can't answer that one.  It's got a great and scary concept though.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>This is one of the most gripping films I have seen in a long time.  No, it is not a mega-special-effects blockbuster like Armageddon, but a much more realistic story.<p>Animal rights activists ultimately destroy England when they release infected chimpanzees.  They are infected with Rage, an illness which drives the infected into a murderous rage when encountering someone not infected.<p>Jim wakes up in a hospital ala Day of the Triffids.  He wanders an empty London trying to figure out if he is hallucinating or not.  The Empty London and contact with a pair of other survivors shows shades of The Quiet Earth.<p>Soon reality sets in for Jim as he and his companions in survival search for others.  They eventually wind up at a country estate fortified in a manner similar to The Omega Man.<p>The story explores some interesting concepts including the key issue of what do you offer people when all hope is lost so that suicide is not a viable answer.  How can hope be resurrected?<p>The changes Jim goes through are very well done.  He starts confused and dazed, moves to mild acceptance, continues to belief and ultimately becomes a resourceful survivor.<p>The DVD contains a number of deleted scenes, the original ending (which I liked), another alternate ending and an extremely alternate ending where the second half of the film follows a completely different path.<p>This is not a teen horror film like Scream or Halloween, but one that relies more on fear and atmosphere like the original The Haunting.  Excellent.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, The Beach) directs this horror film, which is everything that is proclaimed by the review tagline on the back of the DVD package.  28 Days Later is the most visionary horror film to come along in years, thanks in part to some excellent performances from everyone involved, a super creepy atmosphere that is more than believable, and a refreshing take on the zombie genre.  When Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes out of a coma, he finds the hospital, along with just about all of England, deserted and abandoned.  Soon enough, he finds out why, and with the help of a few survivors, struggles to survive the onslaught of rage infected virus carriers.  The word zombie is never mentioned once during the film, but it's pretty apparent what this rage virus does to people, and the film never slows down from the time of its' opening sequence on.  28 Days Later is the scariest zombie film to come along since the original Dawn of the Dead, and with it's share of twists and turns, is always full of surprises, and this is clearly Boyle's best directorial effort since Trainspotting.  Anyone who calls this film boring obviously considers Scream a classic, and older horror fans who were raised on horror films like Romero's Dead trilogy and Halloween will find plenty to admire with this modern day classic.  The DVD extras here are great as well, including the commentary by Boyle and writer Alex Garland, plus 3 alternate endings.</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>"28 Days Later" could easily be the fourth installment in George Romero's "Living Dead" trilogy - only this time the zombies have a bit more get up and go to them.<p>When Jim wakes up out of a coma one day, he discovers that not only is he the only person in the hospital but virtually the only person left in the entire city of London.  After wandering through the deserted city streets for awhile, he eventually runs into a couple of stalwart survivors who inform him that 28 days earlier a plague began sweeping across the planet - catalyzed by the release of some infected test monkeys - causing people to turn into mindless killing machines and passing on the virus to their victims through their blood.  <p>Although "28 Days Later" is little more than a rip-off of those earlier zombie classics, director Danny Boyle does bring a certain level of artistry to his handling of the material, particularly with his apocalyptic visions of a London and an English countryside utterly bereft of human beings.  There's a real end-of-the-world eeriness to much of what we see on the screen, a product more of suggestiveness than of blatant visualization.  Indeed, Boyle shows the zombies as little as possible, a wise move for a couple of reasons: first, because leaving a threat unspecified allows the audience to use its imagination, thereby heightening the suspense and tension, and, second, because, quite frankly, these fleet-footed zombies simply aren't all that terrifying when we get a close-up view of them (certainly not on a level with Romero's lumbering - and truly horrifying - originals).  And that, perhaps, is the biggest complaint I have against the film.  For all the impressiveness of the visuals and the tone, "28 Days Later" just isn't a very scary film in the long run.  The plotting is derivative, the characters not very well developed, and the poorly staged final showdown more laughable than frightening.  Like two many horror films, this one suffers from a weak third act, with the anticipatory windup more impressive than the delivery.<p>There's a lot to admire and recommend in "28 Days later."  But it just doesn't get under the skin the way the best horror films do - and the nightmares just don't come.</p></br><a href="../users/A96JD9312DHWC.html">A96JD9312DHWC</a><br/><p>Rage. It affects many a singularity in the whole, passing through the social body with so many a cataclysmic repercussion. Many of the worst times in history are cast in its dye, and many of the things we fear are byproducts of the tongue it universally speaks. So, if rage were to pass through society like a virus, want would the effect be? And what would happen if you were one of the unlucky ones that didn't have the grace to bow out before the world went mad? <p>28 Days Later is a story about just that, picking up with its main character 28 days after the initial onset of this epidemic hits the world at large. Unlike many movies of its zombie-like type, it is also set in a different realm of interaction, within Britain, and that has some ramifications with regard to the outcome of the movie. For instance, there is no outlet to go to and to procure weaponry of the higher velocity, user friendly, type, with people instead having to opt for blunt weapons, machetes, and iron showings of will. The characters are different that the "norm" as well, with those souls not exactly conforming to rigid horror stereotypes that have plagued the genre in the past. This, in turn, sets the stage for something that erupts well initially and seems to say that it will have many a thing to add to the fold. Fear, blood, violence, and shock come out of the woodworks, and that makes a tale that seems like it will be promising. But then, just when things seem to be going somewhere, the task of telling goes into a tailspin and emerges in a mundane realm that has been so many times done before. The story actually forces itself into completion and it strays, adding in soldiers and some subversive storyline while taking away from the horror and disappointing someone expecting what was touted by the makers - a movie that was, in a word, frightful.<p>This isn't to say that the movie has nothing to offer, because it does give something back. It has some gore, a nice look at a menace that is somewhat like the overused zombie but that is fast and angry instead of slow and brutish, and it picks up in the middle of the problem instead of at the beginning. This gives the viewer a different perspective of the woe manifesting and, in some rights, this would have been fine. The downside to this is that it becomes a human drama in the end, actually leaving out the menace of the rage-infected except for a slow trickling that is, in effect, dull. Sure, excuses have been made that it was trying to make a point, but couldn't that point have appeased the mind with the overuse of horror instead of becoming its skinny, underloved brother? <p>To add to this, the DVD touts three alternate endings that will "blow your socks off," but that advertisement is egregiously deceptive. Two of the ending only have to do with shuffling who lives and dies, and the third, the radical changes, aren't really "shown" to the viewer at all. They are instead ideas that erupted in the middle of making the film and they weren't processed passed the storyboard phase. So, ironically, the best way the movie could have gone, with the bad part of the movie actually removed, is further accented by "the story that could have been" told to you as if you were reading a book.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>It is not so much that &quot;28 Days Later...&quot; is a classic horror film, but that this 2003 effort is heads and shoulders above the schlock that fans of the genre have had to endure so far this century.  Even when a horror film has a good (&quot;Ghost Ship&quot;) or great (&quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot;) opening, the rest of the film and the payoff end up being disappointing.  The payoff for &quot;28 Days Later...&quot; is a debatable element as well, especially when director Danny Boyle offers an alternative theatrical ending as well as an additional ending that basically combines the first two on the DVD.  You will have to decide that offering different endings, one of which you will have to like a lot more than the other, is ultimately a good thing or a bad thing.<p>The prologue of the film begins with televised images of rioting in the streets, but the main show has not begun yet.  Instead we are watching a chimpanzee that is being subjected to all this media violence in a medical testing facility somewhere in England.  A group of animal activists arrive to document the treatment of the chimps and to set them free, which they do, despite the frantic protests of one of the lab's scientists who explains the animals have been infected with a &quot;rage&quot; virus.  Of course the do-gooders do not listen and 28 days later Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up in a hospital bed from a coma, having been hit by a car, and discovers everybody is gone.  <p>In a series of chilling shots, Jim makes his way through a deserted London, finding only bits and pieces of information in scattered newspapers about a virus that has forced the evacuation of the city.  In a corpse filled church he meets an apparent survivor, but there is clearly something wrong and it is only when Jim is rescued by Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley) that they explain the bad news.  These are, for the purposes of this film, the rules of the game and they are straightforward and simple enough to make this horror film work.  <p>After all, the obvious comparison here is with &quot;Night of the Living Dead,&quot; where the dead rose to become flesh-eating zombies because the earth passed through the tail of a comet.  Since minimal direct contact with fluids carrying the virus result in someone becoming &quot;infected&quot; in 10-20 seconds, I keep thinking that most of these people are ghouls rather than zombies, but correct categorization is not an imperative here.  Unlike the slow, doddering zombies of George A. Romero's film, the infected are more manic and considerably more violent.  Still, it is impossible to forget that black &amp; white classic, especially when it comes to believing that our small band of heroes are going to get out of this with any of them being alive.<p>After Mark becomes the obligatory first fatality, making it clear how quickly people turn and that the only way of dealing with it is to kill the infected person P.D.Q., Jim and Selena team up with the unlikely team of cab driver Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his teenage daughter Hannah (Megan Burns).  Having picked up a repeating radio message that the answer for infection can be found at a military post outside of Manchester (a scene that will remind older viewers of a sub-plot in the film &quot;On the Beach&quot;), the quartet head out of town to see if they can find other survivors.  Meanwhile, high up in the stratosphere an airliner passes overhead, a sign that the normal world is out there somewhere, but that England is a quarantined land.<p>The fact that the last part of &quot;28 Days Later...&quot; turns into more of an action film strikes some viewers as odd, but the situation is comparable to &quot;Aliens,&quot; where you can slaughter dozens of the bad guys because they are not considered human, a free pass to mondo blood-letting and lots of gore in the logic of contemporary movie making.  At the heart of it all is the attempt of the main characters, a family unit forged out of necessity and fear, to keep alive.  Our ability to relate to their situation is what makes this film work, which is why the cast are unfamiliar faces, as in &quot;The Blair Witch Project.&quot;  The effective rock score by John Murphy and cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle are other strong elements as well.<p>For the record, I think the alternative theatrical ending provides the strongest ending.  That version is at least a 4.5 and I round up to make it clear that &quot;28 Days Later...&quot; is the top choice for discerning horror film fans who are looking for something that will turn their stomach...in a good way.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>Shot on video (DV) and transferred to film, this INDEPENDENT post-apocalyptic horror film should be treated as a low-budget exercise with a reasonable cast and a hot director. So how does it pan out? The truth is that the director strives hard for realism and nearly gets there only to blow it completely with a dud and stupid second half.<p>Essentially this is a revamp of the horror novel "I am Legend" by Richard Matheson crossed with "Day of the Trifids" with more than a touch of George A. Romeros "Night of the Living Dead". The story starts well - man wakes up from a coma only to discover that London is deserted with a plague of zombies (called the Infected.. and yes they do just act like zombies except that they run) on the loose, starts to violently come to grips with this new reality and meets up with survivors who are trying to stay alive. The realism in the first half is shocking. It does reach right on down in there and makes you feel very uncomfortable about what you are seeing. There are scenes of animal abuse, child murders and friends chopping each other up once they have become infected. Nasty stuff, but this is how you would expect things to be in the type of scenario that Danny Boyle brings so well to the screen.<p>Then it all goes downhill as the survivors end up going to Manchester to hook up with another group of survivors who turn out to be the army corp. Wait until you get this.... the army corp have not had any women and so .... they go completely mad and try to rape the survivors. Realism goes out the window and sadly the film crashes into total and utter absurdity.<p>Overall the only reason you should watch this is for the (1)Gore, (2)To see how a Digital Video Transfer looks and (3)For the first half.<p>Not very good, but not all that bad either. There a lot of better zombie (*cough*cough* - are we allowed to say Zombie here??) films out there and certainly better post-apocalyptic ones. This movie just tried to get a more realistic edge but the burning plot holes make Swiss-cheese of things in no time.</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>Danny Boyle made the most difficult: to recreate with astonishing realism, the end of the Western Civilization.

Because of the script needed a major chilling punch.

There is great background music in the film and the scene at church had me jumping. This film wasn't your average very scary film. However, it had quite a few good things going for it and I hope I get to see more films like it. I think it makes a whole lot of more sense than the trash that has been released this year like "The Ring 2"<br /><br />Watch this film now or you will regret not doing so. Don't listen to the negative reviews because this film is unbelievable in it's own way. Don't wait for HBO to show it but RENT/BUY/STEAL it today.</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>Man, I really shoulda reviewed this a damn long time ago. Anyway, where to start.  Well, I guess I'll say right up front that '28 Days Later' may be the greatest zombie movie ever.  Or perhaps what I'd actually say is that '28 Days Later', 'Night of the Living Dead', 'Dawn of the Dead' and 'Shaun of the Dead' are all both so great and so different from one another that I couldn't really say that one was 'better' than the  other.  'NotlD' is the masterpiece of despair, 'DotD' is just so distinctive and odd, and 'Shaun' is funny. (duh) I suppose '28 Days Later' may be the most straight forward of them, as it works most from a dramatic and human interest standpoint.  As others have said this isn't just  a horror movie, it just kinda qualifies as one by default, due to it's apocalyptic nature and the zombies and whatnot.  The horror is largely clustered at the beginning and end, and although it is very good, it's really no more significant than the more dramatic material between it.  '28 Days Later' is populated by some of the most sympathetic, likable characters you're likely to find in any genre, and this is what makes the movie works, as much as anything.  It's quite a powerful movie, really.  Thematically, it's primarily interested in resiliency of the spirit and the ability to deal with tragedy.  These are terribly common themes, of course, but this film makes them work a lot better than most others do.<br /><br />Of course, lotsa people out there are gonna try and tell me this isn't a zombie film, but these people can piss off.  I'll admit it, upon first hearing about this movie, prior to the US release, it didn't sound like it was really a zombie movie: they aren't dead, they don't eat flesh, as far as we can tell.  The fact of the matter is, however, that the infected individuals in the movie *look* and *act* just like zombies: They attack humans on sight, without weaponry, while ignoring other infected individuals; they have no apparent intelligence; they spread disease through physical contact, and they're all icky.  The fact that they're alive shouldn't matter, because being undead doesn't actually signify anything, necessarily.<br /><br />As you certainly know, this film involves the decimation of England due to an outbreak of 'rage', a disease which, naturally, causes people to pretty much act like zombies.  Our main character, Jim, was injured in a bike wreck just prior to the outbreak, and wakes up in the hospital 4 weeks later.  Other than this, the film doesn't really have that much of a plot.  It's sorta a slice of life from the post-apocalyptic world, as it is primarily interested in Jim's meeting with and bonding with other people, and the continued search for any other survivors.  This is a reasonable arc, as the film is more about character and mood than it is about any over arching scheme.  The film also develops a real sense of tragedy and desolation that is often inexplicably missing from this sorta film.  Sure, we all know that it would be highly upsetting if the world were to end tomorrow, but most of apocalyptic films fail to make me feel the loss. This one succeeds.<br /><br />The endless, severe tragedy of the opening gives way to the generally violence free and relatively lighthearted middle section, as our group searches for a military base.  Nothing much happens in most of these scenes, but they reveal the humanity of the characters, and show that most of the time, life just goes on.  Here the central theme comes out.  Early in the film, the hardened Selena says, flatly, `Surviving is as good as it gets'.  The film itself counters this, more or less saying that if just surviving is as good as it gets, than their really isn't much point in surviving any longer.  Again, perhaps an obvious point, but the film really makes you believe it.<br /><br />As always, I finally lose patience with looking at it in an overall perspective, and just have to talk about some specific scenes.  Early in the film, the Mark character gives a brief monologue about the death of his family.  This is a truly chilling scene, which can't help but remind me of Ben's monologue from `NotlD'.  Also, `28 Days Later' has one of the most tragic, gut-wrenching death scenes I've ever come across.  I can't go into specifics, naturally, but it's really powerful.  Finally, though many have complained about the climax, I like it quite a lot.  It's truly intense, with some brutal, if not particularly gory violence.  It's largely helped by the slowly building and brilliant post-rock score. (People love to rave about the use of GYBE towards the beginning, but I think the original score at the end works even better.)<br /><br />I have no real complaints about the film.  The performances are all great, and the direction controlled and adept, with a kinetic, visceral feel without being so formless and out of control as so many recent films.  They do perhaps over use the frame removal stuff a bit, but this is no big problem.

This movie is remenicent of doomsday flicks like &quot;The Omega Man&quot; and &quot;The Last Man on Earth&quot;.  Unlike those movies, this has real suspense.  The gore and blood is too much to take, but what I liked about the movie is its clever cinematography and editing.  The climax, however, left me cold asking, &quot;is that it&quot;?  Something like an unfinished term paper without a conclusion.  It could have been much better if the loose ends would have been completed.  With that said, it's still a good thriller!</p></br><a href="../users/A2HII4U9WQ0XUV.html">A2HII4U9WQ0XUV</a><br/><p>Our world has gone completely Mad.<br /><br />Have you ever thought that very thing---thought it as you watch the news, as you surf the Net, as you read your morning paper? As you watch flickering news reports of the latest mass riot in Liverpool or Paris, ethnic cleaning in the Balkans, slave-trading in the Sudan, tribal genocide all across Africa, our own politicians slobbering at the mouth as they call their opponents liars, morons, traitors?<br /><br />As you see the latest news flash: shaven-skulled "militia" in dusty fatigues in some dirty border town, shoving weary refugees this way and that with the muzzles of their AK-47s. Or a breathless anchor bringing you up to speed on the fact two levees have given way, erasing---totally obliterating---a city you thought was there for the Ages?<br /><br />Great. Now imagine that that kind of Insanity amped up a billion times, only it's catching through the blood. Imagine that and you have the travelogue to Hell that is Danny Boyle's "28 Days Later." And in Danny Boyle's film, Hell is very much other people.<br /><br />Centuries ago the brilliant English physicist and celebrated polymath Sir Isaac Newton contended that "I see so far because I stand on the shoulders of giants." The same thing might be said of director Danny Boyle, who draws heavily on his own giants---zombie Grandmasters like George Romero, Dan O'Bannon, and Stephen King---for his own hyperkinetic descent into a post-Apocalyptic English Hell, "28 Days Later".<br /><br />But with that in mind, Boyle has distilled all of the shock and terror of Romero's zombie trilogy into two hours of pure adrenaline, two hours of raw, sheer, shrieking terror. He has, with "28 Days Later", out-Romero'd Romero, and his stark, horrific, harrowing portrait of a London gone literally mad manages to capture the end of the world in a manner that utterly eluded the the TV-adaptation of King's "The Stand".<br /><br />Forget the fact that the red-eyed, shrieking legions of the Infected in this movie aren't classic zombies: sure, they don't feed on the flesh of their victims, and yes, they don't lumber and shamble along.<br /><br />The Infected don't just get Mad. They get Even.<br /><br />Nothing in this movie lumbers or shambles along---but make no mistake about it, Boyle's latest is a zombie film, and it is so good, and so scary, that it rightfully claims its Crown as King of the Zombie Movies.<br /><br />Here are some tasty little nuggets about the movie to tempt you with, without spoilers to ruin your appetite:<br /><br />The PLOT: Animal rights activists break into a Cambridge biowarfare research facility, intent on setting their primate buddies free. A goggle-eyed scientist, returning a bit late with his moca frappucino, witnessing the break-in, begs them not to free the chimpanzees: the beasts are infected with a highly contagious virus known as Rage, which is spread through the blood and within 20 seconds turns its victim into a froth-mouthed, shrieking homicidal maniac.<br /><br />The activists ignore the warning, a young woman opens a chimp's cage, and within seconds the chimp launches itself into its erstwhile rescuer's face.<br /><br />Our protagonist, a bike messenger played sympathetically by Cillian Murphy, awakens from a coma in an eerily empty hospital ward; he stumbles out of the hospital into an equally empty London, and the fun begins.<br /><br />The CINEMATOGRAPHY: Director of Photography Anthony Dod Mantle is an adherent of Dogme, the cinematic movement committed to using natural lighting; the result sets up the movie's haunting, sere, and unsettling visuals. London broils under a jaundiced, sterile sky, and broods at twilight in an otherwordly greyish blue; the empty city resembles an alien moonscape, and a gas station explosion is shot as though on another planet.<br /><br />The Infected here don't walk, lumber, or lurch: they run---fast.<br /><br />London's zombies are glimpsed only as a shrieking blur, or caught as loping shadows against a tunnel-wall; the combination of hyperkinetic editing and the blood-spattering gore (captured using much the same technique employed in the battle sequences of "Saving Private Ryan" and "Gladiator") makes the lulls between encounters with the Infected unbearably suspenseful.<br /><br />The ACTING: Everyone here is an unknown (with the exception of "Gangs of New York"'s stolid Brendan Gleeson, who plays a London taxicab driver and---for a few minutes, anyway---gives the movie a reassuring moral center), and the acting is all superb and believable.<br /><br />Cillian Murphy manages a remarkable transformation during the film, remarkable both for its outlandishness and (given the horror of his character's plight) believability. Noamie Harris and Noah Huntley shine as London survivors, and Christopher Eccleston is superbly Kurtzian as an embattled British Army Major at the center of his own raging heart of darkness.<br /><br />MORAL of the STORY? Two, really: 1) if you're an animal activist, pick targets other than biowarfare facilities; and 2) if you're a soldier holed up in an English manor home, don't keep an infected zombie chained by the leg in the house garden.<br /><br />Many of "28 Days"'s critics have attacked the movie for being 'derivative'---and yes, Boyle borrows heavily from a treasure-house of zombie and horror movies. The movie practically condenses all of the major action from Romero's 'Dead' trilogy, and the climactic, operatic final sequences in a storm-tossed English manor house could have been lifted directly from the horror video game "Resident Evil. But Boyle takes his inspiration, consolidates it, and then sets out in new, unexpected, and terrifying directions.<br /><br />Boyle has crafted a masterpiece of movie terror, and one of the most bleakly disturbing films about the end of the world ever made.<br /><br />And keep your lights out---they're drawn to lights.<br /><br />JSG</p></br><a href="../users/A1N0LCPR7O7OLL.html">A1N0LCPR7O7OLL</a><br/><p>Really good movie.  The acting by the entire cast is phenomenal.  The cinematography (digital) is some of the best I have ever seen.  The script is strong dialogue wise although it completely ripped off scenes from other movies (i.e. dawn of the dead and day of the dead).  What made the film for me though no matter what bad things I could say about it is the three central characters are so likeable, we care about them so much that movie works...Easily.  This is one of those films where the cast really carries it all the way through.  Boyle really lucked out in that respect.  There are indeed a few suspenseful scares though regardless of what the other reviewers might say...And I have seen quite a few scary movies.  Not sure how I feel about the ending yet but overall this is a highly entertaining film worth a rental.</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>This is one of these movies that fit into the zombie genre (sort of) and is about a disease that turns people into zombies, but of course there are survivors and they have to deal with that, and avoid getting infected. For a movie of its genre, or horror movies overall, this one was all right - not awesome, but not awful, either. Some will like it, some won't, it depends on each person's personal tastes.</p></br><a href="../users/A1KFBAPAKMEQUF.html">A1KFBAPAKMEQUF</a><br/><p>I'm not sure why this is classified as a "horror" or "zombie" film.

Didn't find it scary at all.  Found it to be great.  Could have done without the "f" bombs though.<br /><br />Won't spoil the plot for you, but will say that this movie should be classified as "sci-fi", which is what it is as it presents a future Britain undergoing the after effects of a nation-wide virus.

Absolutely terrific and scarier than you can possibly imagine.<br /><br />Some people might not like the fact that there's not a whole lot in the way of action, but honestly, there's a good deal of action sequences despite the fact it's not necessarily a totally action-dominated film, and the atmosphere that builds up to those action sequences is pretty terrific too, because you get a sense of constant uneasy feelings around every turn.  You really feel the main characters as they struggle to find a way to safety and survive.<br /><br />The only complaint is that the film is REALLY dark so it's hard to see anything during the night settings.<br /><br />My favorite thing about the movie are how the monsters go crazy whenever they become infected, and it's just an exciting movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A3OXHLG6DIBRW8.html">A3OXHLG6DIBRW8</a><br/><p>"28 Days Later" could have been a great movie! Other reviews have covered the plot lines, so I'm not going to rehash them here. This movie had a lot going for it, including a strong plot, good actors, decent effects, and interesting twists.

You are all alone in one of the most bustling cities in the entire world ...? Pretty scary.  Now imagine finding out how that came to be ...? Also terrifying.  Like a Lovecraft tale of terror, Boyle takes us on an adventure for truth and survival with the excellent Cillian Murphy.<br /><br />Apocalyptic story lovers will not be disappointed with this film.<br /><br />Highly recommend!</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>OK, so they aren't zombies, exactly.<br /><br />"Jim" wakes up naked on a hospital bed in an silent ward. Donning some scrubs, he wanders outside into empty London streets. Newspaper headlines blare about evacuations, and bulletin boards are filled with longing pleas for information about the missing. What is wrong becomes more apparent when the sun sets and Jim is beset by a group of wild, thrashing, blood-eyed attackers. He rescued by a pair of strangers wielding flamethrowers, and the film is on.<br /><br />Director Danny Boyle has put together an exciting piece of work that combines the thrills of the science fiction disease genre (a la Andromeda Strain) and the anarchic wackiness of zombie films. His small group of survivors is desperate to find shelter, to avoid contamination and to find others of their kind. Luckily for them, the empty city provides ample food and transportation to do about anything they want, and they head out of the city to follow a faint radio beacon promising safety.<br /><br />To say more is to give too much away. The movie stays fairly believable until about midway, when its lapses increasingly into silliness and implausibility. For all their supposed "pure rage," the infected people could have used a bit more dionysiac, limb-rending fury. And a subtext about dolling up a pair of females before ravishing them seems (in the face of constant threat by crazed zombies) to be an unnecessary and titillating diversion.<br /><br />But "28 Days Later" is entertaining, well-acted (Cillian Murphy as Jim is terrific, especially as a befuddled ex-patient) and tries to be intelligent about a ludicrous situation. The DVD extras include interviews with the film-makers that are self-importantly and silly. But tfilm is also very well shot, with wonderfully evocative shots of abandoned London landmarks and traffic-free English highways. One of the better efforts of the zombie genre, even if they weren't zombies, exactly.</p></br><a href="../users/A13IKSGDYNBNQS.html">A13IKSGDYNBNQS</a><br/><p>The main difference between say this and Romero's first two classic zombie films is that here the infected are able to run. This makes them much more dangerous than the slow moving variety in Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead. Indeed Dawn of the Dead has some strong black comedy elements to it because of the zombies slowness. No such luxury with 28 Days Later, its all pretty scary and relentless. The zombies in this film are humans infected with a Rage virus which can passed on by blood or saliva.<br /><br />As most other reviewers have said the opening scenes in a deserted London are superbly done. Its hard to tell how much CGI work was involved to create the effect but I do know they had permission to close off one of the London Bridges for the early scenes.<br /><br />In the action scenes the film is full of very fast cutting and editing techniques, which I don't normally like, but in this instance it fits in with the conditions the survivors are having to deal with perfectly. Danny Boyle racks up the tension and the film maintains a fast-pace so unlike a lot of films, this one seems shorter than its actual running time (108 mins).<br /><br />Its certainly not for the squeamish, and if you are in any doubt about your horror film stamina, then I'd rent it first (unless its very cheap). However I strongly recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A13OMT8D4GPIBV.html">A13OMT8D4GPIBV</a><br/><p>Danny Boyle's apocalyptic 28 Days Later is a very solid horror film.  The first two acts are particularly exciting.  Part tension and part excitement, the first half with keep you engaged.  But around the time the third half rolls around, you won't know what hit you.<br /><br />The ending is just as interesting.  It's a very good movie with a few misteps but enjoyable nonetheless.<br /><br />The DVD features a commentary, deleted scenes, two alternate endings (one filmed, one storyboard), and and some featurettes.<br /><br />Quite an interesting take on the horror genre.<br /><br />Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Ah, what better way to spend 3 1/2 hours than watching bloody projectile vomiting in high-def?<br /><br />Perhaps inspired by Stephen King's The Stand <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451169530">The Stand (Signet)</a> where a deadly virus escapes a secret government facility and obliterates the world as we know it, Director Danny Boyle <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001XALTG">Trainspotting</a>  and writer Alex Garland (rumored to be involved with the film adaptation of the video game Halo...sweeeeet!) take the killer virus theme to the next level in 2002 with 28 Days Later.<br /><br />28 Days opens with what happens when animal activists go wild. In a short, violent sequence we see how a voraciously contagious virus that turns people into raging lunatics gets released into society. Flash to pre-Scarecrow Cillian Murphy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BUYP4Q">Batman Begins</a> waking up  several days later in a hospital bed after most of the rest of society has been affected by the germs. (Coincidentally{?} we see this same beginning to a world gone mad in two other recent zombie-type stories: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1582406723">The Walking Dead, Vol. 1: Days Gone Bye</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RXZL04">Resident Evil / Resident Evil: Apocalypse</a> ).<br /><br />Boyle does an excellent job of directing Murphy from his hospital bed into a fight for survival in a new world. And it turns out that Murphy and the folks that he bands up with need to fear more than just 'the infected'. 28 Days is frightening, suspenseful, thrilling, disgusting, realistic, emotionally-charging...all the ingredients in the Horror genre that make up a Classic.<br /><br />Too bad 28 Weeks Later didn't follow suit.<br /><br />28 Weeks Later is a good Horror movie, but a bad sequel. 28 Weeks (fledgling) director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo dropped the ball on several fronts...most importantly that the Rage Virus was supposed to be extremely contagious...coming into contact with just one drop of the contagion should render anyone 'infected'; part of 28 Weeks is the introduction of potentially immune people (just like in The Stand), and that was not lost on me. But there is 'infected' spatter everywhere and on everyone in this movie that seems to have no effect, and that takes away a lot of the realism and continuity that held true in 28 Days.<br /><br />28 Weeks also fails in the way it delivers its scares. In Weeks there's lot's of scare moments that unnecessarily rely more on focusing on an image where one second their is nothing there and it's a deadly silent, then the next second there's a frightening image crashing into the shot accompanied by a loud "PUNG!!!" (like someone landing on the low keys of a piano). Granted, in DTS 5.1, it effectively knocked me of my chair each time, but it was quite dissimilar to 28 Days where the situations and images alone were enough to knock me out of my chair without the 'BOO!' effect. (Only Blu Ray offers DTS; standard version will still knock you out of your chair with the Dolby 5.1 option.)<br /><br />28 Weeks also breaks down in the reality department where tight, military-secure areas are breached by civilians (including teenagers) and a Rage-infected person is not only able to breach dozens of secure areas, but also manages to appear everywhere in the movie.<br /><br />It's the small (important) things like these that took a great movie in 28 Days and turned out an average sequel in 28 Weeks. So overall, Boyle's 5-star Horror/Drama goes to a 3-star Fresnadillo follow-up for me.<br /><br />Final words: Buy 28 Days Later for your collection; rent 28 Weeks Later.</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>a city ravished by disease, millions of zombies, only a few survivors, and you turn with just one drop of blood...crazy. loved this movie, i thought it was very well done. all the chaos, a world of the dead, where's safety, how do you get out? one fine day this man awakens to find the city totally alone. no one, no where, what's going on. everything is turned upside down. he realizes he's not alone. there are thousands of people, and they are very fast. only one problem, they're all dead. running around with a virus, that if a tiny drop falls on you, you become one of them. he has to run, he has to hide, but where? he finds other survivors who together they try to find some help, a way out. when finally they think they have, they still have to fight to survive. i love zombies, i think they're the freakiest. they're people and they're dead, and all they want is to eat people. pretty damn scary. the whole movie was very good, i really liked it. i didn't get scared, but the film in general was wicked good. two thumbs up no doubt.</p></br><a href="../users/A220FJEQNGMSRN.html">A220FJEQNGMSRN</a><br/><p>28 Days Later was one I skipped in theaters because I won't see any more videos badly blown up onto 35mm because some director's convinced himself it looks better than film while the studio saves a few bucks on processing. I'm glad I did, because judging from how bad it looks on DVD it must have been nigh on unwatchable on the big screen. Close-ups are fine, but anything more than a two shot and the lack of depth and detail (not to mention the problems with any straight lines that are anything other than perfectly vertical or horizontal) is a major irritation. The major casualty is any sense of scale - with the long shots looking so horribly flat and lifeless, most of the film is played in medium shots, which means in effect you're watching a TV show with worse picture quality than you'd get on a game show. Rather than the sense of immediacy the makers claim, you're just left at a distance from much of the film because you're too busy squinting to try to work out the background detail.<br /><br />The film itself is utterly predictable in every way - you know who'll die, what the plot twists will be and exactly where and when they'll happen - but aside from the substandard visual quality and the fact that it's basically 'No Blade of Grass' with zombies, it's actually pretty good until the finale, when Cillian Murphy goes all Rambo on squaddies and `infected' alike. Despite the horrible miscasting of David Schneider in the opening scene, the performances are very good, especially the erratic Brendan Gleeson as a London cabbie, which helps raise the bar. It's just a shame that the videography has such a deadening effect on the film.<br /><br />If you want to see a really good British horror movie, however, track down Neil Marshal's The Descent instead.</p></br><a href="../users/A16IXZW2A0NFR6.html">A16IXZW2A0NFR6</a><br/><p>Just when we all thought the zombie flick had been bled totally dry.

It wasn't.<p>I thought the main characters would have ended up being infected. They weren't.<p>The underlying love story? Adam &amp; Eve nonsense, two people forced together, due to them having to repopulate the world or whatever.<p>So what exactly was the point of this film? It seemed disjointed, and seemed to have no idea what direction it wanted to go in. And I nearly fell asleep during it, although I was coming close, and struggling to keep my eyes open, when thankfully it got switched off. Only kidding. It got paused. But that gave me the chance to wake myself and splash my face with cold water. And then I watched the rest of the film. Interesting as it was.<p>It's a British film, which means Americans wouldn't like it, but if they'd done this kind of film, they probably would have over-dramatised it and maybe made a better job. (I said maybe) Being a British movie, it had a real edge to it, to see what Danny Boyle was going to come up with now.<p>The whole love story was totally dense, and felt like it was put together at the last moment. And for any ladies reading this, would you honestly go up to a guy and kiss him, when he's covered in blood? Something tells me you wouldn't.

Borrowing liberally from Day of the Triffids, Night of the Comet [remember that one?] and Omega Man, this erstwhile zombie-ish flick takes place in England and surrounding parts.  When radical do-gooder animal rights activists release test monkeys full of `rage' potion they do more harm than good as usual.  The virus quickly infects everything and turns humans into slavering, red-eyed rage-a-holics.  The token survivor, a bicycle courier, wakes up in a hospital and wanders around the desolate London before things start getting better.  Chased by mobs of the infected he joins up with a few more survivors as they make their way to the requisite military stronghold.  Once there, of course, we see the soldiers have already started breaking down in Lord of the Flies fashion, and boy are they happy to have some chicks show up.  Cinematically impressive, with some gritty effects and angles it's a slightly above average entry into this genre which I'll revisit when the new Dawn of the Dead comes out.</p></br><a href="../users/A928WN8NV03WZ.html">A928WN8NV03WZ</a><br/><p>I was hoping for a lot from this Movie, Danny Boyle is behind a few gems, Trainspotting and Shallow Grave are classics.  But like so many directors, he fell flat once gaining acceptance in the mainstream USA audience, big budgets hindering him more than anything.  This movie wasn't as good as I had hoped, but it was still entertaining and fun to watch.<p>Most interesting is the beginning before you know what is really happening, some people get infected, a scientist freaks out about it, and the opening credits roll.  Then you are brought to the main character, who has been in a coma from a bicycle crash.  He wakes up in an empty hospital, and walks out into a seeminly deserted london.  When he discovers that a plague has decimated or changed most of the town.<p>One thing to note, this isn't as much a zombie movie as it was hyped up to be.  The infected weren't dead, they got the disease and became like rabid animals.  Second, you don't see them as much as you would expect.  This is nice since it keeps them fresh and you don't see a lot of them till later in the movie.  They are also really fast, appearing sometimes out of nowhere and charging like mad for those who haven't been infected.<p>This is more like the earlier Romereo flicks, more about how people react to the desolation of their society and danger of their surroundings; the hardened survivalist that will kill you without blinking if you show signs of infection, the kind father who wants to get his daughter to safety and seems to be almost unaffected by events around him, or the degenerated soldiers.<p>It could have been better, but I think that it was better than a lot of horror movies of late, and hope for future movies from Danny Boyle.  Hopefully a sign that he will return to the former caliber of his early films.</p></br><a href="../users/AD0J5KK4WQXNS.html">AD0J5KK4WQXNS</a><br/><p>I gave this one 2 stars for the theatrical release.

Monkey experiments cause an infection to spread across Britain turning people rapid. Survivors try to make it to civilization. Cue lots of set pieces involving who is going to make it and who is not. The producers of this film often have posters for "The National Lottery" in various scenes as a movie in-joke gimmik.<p>28 Days Later has appeal in the realm of independent movie productions but certainly does not surpass the offerings of Romero or even Fulci for that matter. It has a social and psychological element that may move this into the category of intelligent horror, but at the same time the IQ drops a few points in various scenes. For example:<p>- Why are the army so crazed to rape women only 28 Days after the holocaust? (US soldiers in Iraq will probably laugh their heads off)<br />- Why do characters still walk into "traps"? (You know - when a character goes for a walk on their own or drive into a dark place.)<br />- Why hasn't the world done something about it? (Very plausible when you think about the ending.)<p>So some intelligence points granted - others subtract from this. Overall there is a good representation of England turned deserted except for zombies that "run" amok, some very violent scenes and a few interesting parallels between mankind and the zombies. Essentially it is a film of two halves. The first half takes place in London as survivors meet up, get killed and try to make their way to safety. The second half of the film takes place in a Military compound in Manchester. The film borrows heavily from - Day of the Triffids; man wakes up from a coma to find the world desolate, Day of the Dead; Army try to protect the survivors only to turn on them and they have an ex-soldier turned zombie to experiment on, The Stand; the scene in the tunnel is from that book. So 28 Days Later is not exactly the most original Zombie horror flick in the world, but the originality is in the direction of being more art-house than mainstream and for that it does look better than most but is still a no-brainer in the guts.<p>I'd watch it though for the video look (Canon XL1S) that is done quite well considering you can buy this camera on Amazon for $3,529.88. Independent filmmakers will enjoy that and heck so might you.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZTSOBAPOWT3.html">A1ZTSOBAPOWT3</a><br/><p>A blasted monkey undergoing biological enhancement testing was the source of deterioration. &quot;28 Days Later&quot; may be mistaken as a zombie film, but it's more about the social commentary of learned violence. In my opinion, survival of the fittest was developed early during human evolution as the lonely survivors (Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris) killed the plagued victims of RAGE and they had to build a new trust. Overall, the movie is creepy especially when Jim woke up from his coma to a deserted London and when he discovered bodies in the church. It's a great movie up to the point where Jim and his friends stumbled upon the military base to be saved. Even the military had become savages and had vile intentions for the women. Violence comes from humans as society is the order of their compulsions. Everything falls apart and the heroes are left stranded once again in seclusion from the world and the feeling of despair never enters their minds. This isn't a scary movie like the original &quot;Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; or one of those diabolical slashers, but it's a good movie with a surprising, meaningful message. If you're looking for watermelons or cherries falling out of people's necks or swarms of monsters chasing people all over the place, this isn't your movie. People will be disappointed. The moments of silence in the movie are really the most frightening. Then I realized that I actually live in the mountains and I became afraid of where I'm living. What if a bunch of insane monsters with bad breath and a crazed look in their eyes came running toward my house and crashed through my house just to spit on me? Then I wanted to hide my food. Wow, that's scary man. &quot;28 Days Later&quot; is a good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>Movie 4 stars, video quality 2 stars (it's the source)here's why:<br /><br />"28 Days Later" is a terrific film but be aware that it was shot with a Canon HD camera and director Boyle degraded the image quality even more AFTER shooting to get a cinema verite look to the film. As a result, the Blu-ray doesn't look all that great (I imagine that "Blair Witch" should it ever arrive in a high definition format probably won't look all that great either). The last five minutes of the film was shot on higher quality video (or film I don't recall which)and, as a result, looks extremely good. Just be prepared for a shock when you see the film as it won't live up to films like "3:10 to Yuma" or even Boyle's own "Sunshine" because the format used to shoot the film.<br /><br />The story is very familiar I'm sure but we'll revisit it anyway. Jim (Cillian Murphy)a bike messenger awakens in a completely desserted hospital after surgery. He ends up walking the empty streets of London where a disaster clearly has occurred. Jim finds that the city and most of England have been infected with a man made virus Rage that turns people into zombie-like killers interested only in infecting, eating or killing others. Jim and trio of survivors make their way through the countryside trying to discover if anyone else has survived this epidemic.<br /><br />The Blu-ray has the exact same features as the original DVD. Surprisingly, my DVD looks better upconverted than the Blu-ray. Great movie just be prepared that this won't look as good as "Blade Runner" or "Troy" (or even the sequel "28 Weeks Later"). This isn't the Blu-ray I would break out to sell the merits of ANY high definition format. The fact is that Boyle meant for this to look like this.<br /><br />Regardless, the film is terrific and Danny Boyle's taunt direction of Alex Garland's script creates an often terrrifying, suspenseful tale. Look for Christopher Eccleston ("Dr. Who: The First Series", "Heroes")as a military commander who has created a bizarre, sterile Eden for his soldiers and Brendan Gleeson ("Troy", "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire", "Kingdom of Heaven", "Bravehart")as a father who's only interest is in keeping as normal a life as possible for his daughter and getting her to safety.<br /><br />This is a well made, tauntly directed film. As long as your expectations on the quality of the video are adjusted, you'll enjoy "28 Days Later". Keep in mind the source (Canon HD handheld video camera-except for the conclusion which looks extremely good and is the only part of the film that was shot on 35mm film).<br /><br />I'd give the film itself 5 stars but the "look" 2 stars it is, however, supposed to look this way.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DZKOOMMJM1MI.html">A1DZKOOMMJM1MI</a><br/><p>A virus that locks those infected into a permanent state of killing rage, is accidentally released from a British research facility. Carried by animals and humans, the virus is impossible to contain, and spreads across the entire planet. Twenty-eight days later, a small group of survivors are trapped in London, caught in a desperate struggle to protect themselves from the infected. As they attempt to salvage a future from the apocalypse, they find that their most deadly enemy is not the virus, but other survivors.  <p>The film starts brilliantly with a brief prologue in which animal rights activists break into a top secret laboratory to set free the animals held there. Unfortunately, they decide to release a chimpanzee that carries a deadly new virus called Rage. 28 days later, Jim (Cillian Murphy) awakes from a coma in hospital to find the city of London apparently deserted - little does he know that the homicidal victims of Rage are at large across the country. This British variation on the post-apocalyptic zombie movie was scripted by Alex Garland, whose book The Beach had previously been filmed by director Danny Boyle. But where zombies in other movies are slow and crave the taste of human flesh, the red-eyed zombies here sprint around at high speed and are satisfied with merely killing or spreading the virus through bloody vomit. We are told that Britain has been evacuated, so only a few survivors remain to share the country with what's left of the infected population. The streets we see are deserted (there's a nice sequence at the start with Jim wandering alone through the city) and only occasionally will bands of marauding zombies emerge to pick off the uninfected, which makes you wonder where they go to for the rest of the time - the attacks aren't quite relentless enough in their frequency.<br /><br />The vision of a devastated society is convincingly portrayed, with plenty of pop culture references and brand names to show what has been left behind. There is also nostalgia for lost families; in fact, the people Jim joins up with become surrogate families for him, whether it's with Brendan Gleeson's decent taxi driver and his daughter, or the rather more dysfunctional troop of soldiers headed by Christopher Ecclestone. The soldiers make it clear that now the culture is in ruins the violence inherent in everyone has broken through to the surface, infected or not. <p>The film carries a few twists to the plot which will keep you interested through-out. The film is well-acted, particularly by Murphy (Disco Pigs), who has a spaced-out quality as an actor that really adds to his role. It`s also filmed on digital video, giving the film a gritty, more realistic feel and distinguishing it from glossy Hollywood horrors such as Scream etc.<p>This is an excellent film that presents a unique view of London and breathes new life into the zombie genre. In addition, the shocks work brilliantly and there are some truly terrifying moments. Which, let`s face it, is all you really need from a zombie flick. Impressive, atmospheric and very scary, this is an extremely effective British horror movie. Worth going to see. This blows any horror film released this year away. It is te film "Stephen King's The Stand" should have been. Highly Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>I had seen this film a few times and it's surprisingly good. "28 Days Later" is a genre-defying film wrapped in a shoebox budget. The key to keeping the sci-fi horror genre alive is to make sure the material and techniques the filmmakers present is at least competent, at it's average creative, and at it's best something that we haven't seen before or haven't seen in such a style or form. George A. Romero did that back in prime of film-making, bringing forth one of the most memorable trilogies of all time for the genre. While many consider Romero to be the A- listed director of horror films, it is important to know that he too had his sources for his little independent film in 1968, and after that was when he really got inventive, resulting in a masterpiece and a lackluster. Director Danny Boyle and author Alex Garland know that if they were to cook up a yarn all too similar to Romero it wouldn't be satisfying. So, they've done what is essential to the success of "28 Days Later"- they take ideas that have been in practice for many years, turn them fresh, and as the audience we feel repelled, excited, terrified, nauseous (perhaps), and enthralled, but we won't leave feeling like we've seen complete hack work.<br /><br />The lab scene at the beginning is a decent introduction. I like this explanation of where the virus came from considering real life viruses such as AIDS supposedly came from chimps. I also found it a much more believable reason for a apocalypse type virus than in other movies, at least the virus didn't come in an asteroid or something. Unlike "Dawn of the Dead", they don't give you an explanation of where the virus came from. I also liked how there is a little more to the story than just fighting off zombies. Actually, most of the movie doesn't even involve fighting the off, most of it is them just talking (which makes the movie a bit slow at times). The movie introduces you to several well developed characters that you will really come to care for as the story progresses. You really are concerned over who may die, or what the group's fate will ultimately be. Basically, you will be drawn into their struggle for survival, as well as enjoying the lighter moments as the group bonds and becomes more like a small family. This film really had a number of intense moments especially the tunnel scene, the group had to work really fast on changing that flat tire before those red eyed, ban-shee screaming zombie's come at them. It was a refreshing change from the usual shuffling zombie gig, and the grisly reality of what to do with a bitten companion before they turn berserk, which was less than a minute, gets you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />A good number of viewers did not like the ending, but after all that these characters have been through it was nice to walk away from this film with some happiness and hope. Not everyone could have pulled off such an idea, but it works well here. In this film I saw some similarities in Romero and some other films (the military scenes reminded me of "Day of the Dead," though the chained up Zombie in this was done for more practical reasons, and the supermarket scene is a little unneeded considering the satirical reverence it had in "Dawn of the Dead"). But what they should understand is that Boyle isn't making a 100% original film, and no one could at this point of the genre's history. He has done, however, the most credible job he could in getting a different tone, a different setting in country, and of a different, enveloping view of the scene structures. Overall, "28 Days Later" is constructed and executed like most sci-fi horror films you've ever seen. I recommend this film to everyone who is old enough to see it because it's truly an artistic masterpiece that actually dares to have a point behind it!</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>First for those looking to buy the Blu-ray of this film--be aware that this was shot on standard definition home video equipment and it looks like it on both DVD and Blu-ray and while the image quality is improved somewhat on Blu-ray, you'll notice the defects much more as well. If you're thinking of upgrading to Blu-ray be aware this will NOT look that great on BD.<br /><br />First the obvious; 28 Days Later borrows from many sources. It's not so much a horror movie but a character study of people in a horrifying situation. 28 Days Later has much more in common with Hitchcock than (Tobe)Hooper. Danny Boyle focuses much more on character and the eerie situation the characters find themselves in more than the thrills and chills of Resident Evil. That's one of the strengths of this fine film. While it may ape Night of the Living Dead (the prototype for all these films), Boyle makes 28 Days Later worthwhile by focusing on how the characters adjust to their horrible situation.<br /><br />Jim wakes up in the hosptial after a biking accident. What's frightening is that he wakes up in a completely deserted building and, from all appearences, city. London is as quiet as a field mouse with no moving traffic and, more importantly, no signs of human life. He quickly discovers that a plague of some sort has broken out and that the uninfected residents were evacuated.<br /><br />He arrives at a church and goes inside. The church is filled with human bodies. Hoping that there might be someone alive in the building he calls out. Two of the "dead" bodies rapidly raise their heads staring right at him. More of the bodies stir. As Jim attempts to leave, he's confronted by a priest who clearly is suffering from the plague. He escapes but is being pursued by the walking dead. Suddenly, he's saved by two masked people who fight off the "Zombies" by burning them and, ultimately, blowing up the gas station where they've converged.<br /><br />Boyle manages to elicit moving performances from his young cast and captures all the torment, fear and sense of dread the survivors feel as they relate stories to each other about what has happened to them.<br /><br />The DVD includes three alternate endings (one of them in storyboard form with narration by the writer and director). One of the film's variations includes a completely different second half to the film (again, it's in storyboard form). This radical departure from the film's theatrical version is very interesting and suggests a completely different, darker film than what was ultimately shown in theaters. It's not surprising that they didn't film it (they had some narrative issues) as this version would have been a complete downer and the film wouldn probably not done as well at the box office as it did otherwise. It also feels a bit unnatural after having viewed the film's actual narrative course.<br /><br />The internet trailer, theatrical teaser and trailer (the latter two basically identical)and audio commentary by director and writer give a unique perspective to the viewer; it feels almost as if one has been working on the film.<br /><br />The DVD transfer looks very good considering that the film was originally shot on standard definition digital video and transferred to film. The sound -- both the effects and the soundtrack itself chillingly come to life on the DVD. While 28 Days Later is a horror movie it's not just slash and burn horror movie. It's a film with heart and, ultimately, more in the tradition of great horror films that examine how the characters cope with the horrible things they witness as the horrible things seen.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZBOBV9H1HDV.html">A3LZBOBV9H1HDV</a><br/><p>"28 Days Later" is the best zombie film I have ever seen. The opening begins with a riot and a group of animal right activists taking monkeys out of an experimental lab. But, what they don't know about the monkeys is that they are infected with a virus that makes a person into a crazed cannibal, or has they are really known as zombies. The main character, Jim, played by Cillian Murphy, who is a bike courier who wakes up at a hospital 28 days after the virus was released. He went into the hospital to have brain surgery before the virus was released because when he was delivering a package when he ended up in the hospital. When he goes around the city, he goes into a church and wakes up some zombies. Then he runs into two survivors, Selena, played by Naomie Harris, and Mark, played by Noah Huntley, who saves him from the zombies that were chasing him down one of the streets in the city. They go to Jim's house and that is where Mark gets infected and Selena kills him. When walking to a safe haven, Jim and Selena sees Christmas lights that are signaling any uninfected survivors to come up there for safety. While trying to get there, Zombies appear. Jim and Selena run from them, then, thanks to Frank and his daughter, Hannah, they were safe. The next day, they hear a broadcast on Frank's handradio to come to Manchester to get away from the zombies. On the way, in a tunnel, they, in Frank's taxi, climb over cars in order to get to Manchester. One of the tires popped and Frank and Hannah had to change the tire. And in there, see rats running from the zombies and that is when they rush to get the tire on in time before they are near them. They get out of there, but, later, Frank is infected by a drop of blood. And that's when they are spotted by a group of soldiers run by Major Henry West, played by Christopher Eccleston. During that time, it is when Jim, Selena, and Hannah discover that the real monsters aren't the zombies, but the soldiers themselves. The ending is too good for words, but I am not going to tell you anymore of this excellent zombie movie. Danny Boyle's directing is extremely brilliant, Cillian Murphy as Jim is smart and intelligent and heartwarming as well as Naomie Harris' Selena is. Brendan Gleeson's performance is extremely heartwarming and emotional as Frank, the grief-stricken father of Hannah. Megan Burns' performance as Hannah is excellent without compromise. But the performance that takes the prize is Christopher Eccleston's. His performance as the crazy Major Henry West is an remarkable performance for a villain ever. John Murphy's score for the movie is encouraging and smart at its best. The production design, the costume design, the visual/make-up effects, the cinematography, the editing is extremely well done at its best just like the rest of the movie is. Go see this movie now in theatres almost everywhere near you! You will surely enjoy it.</p></br><a href="../users/A38QJ7JUUTVLKX.html">A38QJ7JUUTVLKX</a><br/><p>Okay, now that I've watched this again, I can now say that it wasn't as bad as I thought. The reason I lashed out at this film like a child is because of the hype. Believe me this movie is over-hyped. It's not as scary as the previews and critics would have you think. The psychological part of the film is pretty scary and plausible, and the scenes of the movie are geniunely creepy. But anyway on to the plot: Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up from a coma to find London deserted--until he runs into a mob of crazed plague victims. He gradually finds other still-human survivors (including Naomie Harris), with whom he heads off across the abandoned countryside to find the source of a radio broadcast that promises salvation. 28 Days Later is basically an updated version of The Omega Man and other post-apocalyptic visions; but while the movie may lack originality, and intelligence, it has a plausible premise. This is NOT A ZOMBIE FILM! They are people infected with a disease that causes them to go mad. With plot holes galor this film is no Citizen Kane. And what was with that stupid soldier scenes? They were stupid! Their are alot of faults in this film, but it's fun for a horror film. More of a sci-fi movie though, cuz it isn't particualarly scary. I mean the audience I watched it with weren't scared that often, and a 5 year old girl was laughing basically at all the "scares". I will admit that this film wasn't genuinely scary, but it is interesting, even though it lacks common sense. For better and real zombie movies check out Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, and Return of the Living Dead. 3.5 Stars for this average horror flick.</p></br><a href="../users/AF8C86SGYLH81.html">AF8C86SGYLH81</a><br/><p>Horror buffs need to take &quot;28 Days Later&quot; into muchly needed inconsideration.  This had to be the slowest moving horror flick on the planet.  While this British box-office smash was commended for chills and thrills..it is truly a fiasco.  It had two moments of terror...222 moments of predictable JELLO.  I spent $20 on this DVD.  It's worth maybe $5.99.<p>The soundtrack completely sucks...the acting is average...and the editing is the highlight.  Unfortunately, when you edit one bad scene to the next, you simply can't win.  <p>This British loser must have been made by someone who ventured through WW2.  It has the nauseating military twist to it that simply doesn't fit today.  Why is it the British always want to embellish their hatred for the Germans?  Move on!!!!  Get a life!!!!  Make a horror film and get away from those silly military fatigues.  This one is simply billed as a horror film.  That's right...it is simply horrible!!!  It gets a 2!!!  And that's being nice.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>28 Days Later... (Danny Boyle, 2002)<p>28 Days Later... immediately establishes two things: first, that Alex Garland's screenplays are equally as brilliant as his novels (and, as a sidelight, that Danny Boyle letting John Hodge adapt Garland's luscious novel The Beach was an even worse crime than we first thought). Second, that Danny Boyle, given a script with an actual plot, a goal, and enough meat is, in fact, capable of making a good movie.<p>Hot on the heels of these revelations, as I sat through the film for the second time on Sunday afternoon (and this is the first film I have gone to see twice on opening weekend in over a quarter of a century), I realized why the Hollywood machine will never, ever be able to make a film even remotely resembling 28 Days Later.... But more on that, well, later.<p>There has been a good deal of criticism about this movie, and it doesn't surprise me in the least. England has long been the bastion of low-budget horror that achieves a kind of brilliance 28 Days Later... reminded me most in critical reaction of another low-budget horror film from England twenty years ago called XTRO. XTRO is unimaginably brilliant, but like 28 Days Later..., it's not structured like your normal horror film; you get hit with a brick wall at the beginning of the film, and you get hit with a brick wall at the end of the film. The middle contains a few jumps, but is mostly concerned with building plot, characterization, and mystery. (More mainstream filmgoers should be recognizing the pacing by now-the same type of structure was used in both Ringu and Saving Private Ryan.) In other words, it's bound to alienate both the "regular" American horror film fan, who's used to the "scares" coming thick and fast throughout, and the "cerebral" American horror fan, who's used to getting his disturbances from the creep factor and not the gore factor. And to be honest, I'm surprised the film's audiences have been as large as they have (it landed solidly in fourth place this week, behind three films which all were playing at over twice the number of screens). It's almost enough to get me to write Harry Bromley Davenport and tell him that now's the time to re-release XTRO on the big screen. It might have finally found its audience.<p>Aside from the excellent performances (main characters Cillian Murphy and Naomie Harris, and Harris wonderful turns by Boyle regular Christopher Eccleston, the excellent and highly underrated Brendan Gleeson, and Megan Burns), much has been made of Boyle's use of digital photography to shoot the film. Good idea, indeed. The whole thing comes up with an odd quality that is both documentary (zombies in flames can almost be smelled in the theater) and surreal (as Murphy and co. are driving by a field of rotting roses, a guy behind me asked, "is that a painting?"). The film is also layered in its presentation, as any good zombie film since the seventies has been; it asks all the questions a zombie film should ask and still manages to make them come off sounding like we haven't heard them before. Boyle has finally found the right film to posit his seeming deep loathing of the human race, which he attempted to bring to the forefront of both Trainspotting and The Beach without a shred of success. Here, it comes through with crystal clarity. <p>What should have emerged from this review is, overall, a single word: different. This is not your mindless summer blockbuster. This is a film that will make you think, require repeated viewings to catch things you missed the first time, stick in your head long after it's over (probably longer than you want it to), and above all will make you uncomfortable. (And not just with horror; the gore factor is far more suggested than explicit. It's little things like Cillian Murphy's first appearance in the movie being a full-frontal nude shot, which had murmurs of discomfort going through the audience. "We didn't need to see that," the guy behind me said. Yeah, we DID. That's the whole point.) And that was what hit me, when not long after my second viewing I found myself listening, somewhat revolted, to songs on the radio by the winners of American Idol. I loathe the show, and could never really figure out why until then. America, when given the choice, will vote for sameness every time. Reuben and Kelly do not sound markedly different than anything else you're likely to hear on your local soft rock station. And most of the films you're likely to see this summer are not markedly different than those you saw last summer. And 28 Days Later... is above all different. You may have seen every film which is paid homage by various scenes here (and you will likely get more out if it if you've at the very least seen A Clockwork Orange, Dawn of the Dead, Platoon, XTRO, most importantly The Omega Man, and probably fifteen to twenty other movies that aren't coming to mind right now), but you've still never seen it done quite like this.<p>All that said, 28 Days Later... is not a great film. It's a very good one, but not a great one. Boyle isn't flaunting the genre's conventions enough to cross the line into true greatness, and there are things about the movie which give away Boyle as a novice horror director (for example, we don't get much information about Rage, but we get too much early to achieve the spooky ambience of Carpenter's The Fog, without getting a full explanation by the end to really drive the horror home, like in Poltergeist). Still, so far it's a shoo-in to make the year's ten best. ****</p></br><a href="../users/AK0CENM3LUM28.html">AK0CENM3LUM28</a><br/><p>28 Days Later / B0000BZJCM<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />Whether you find 28 Days Later to be frightening will probably depend on your level of tolerance for these sorts of movies. I love zombie movies but am easily frightened, so 28 Days Later definitely scared me on several levels. However, I can see how many people would consider this to be less of a scary horror movie and more of a suspense movie. Either way, I think the film works well.<br /><br />The film opens at a research facility where a group of well-meaning but ill-fated students are breaking in to free the laboratory animal test subjects. The animals are infected with a "Rage Virus" that makes them, well, the Rage virus basically turns you into a very fast, very angry zombie - an unthinking, unfeeling automaton purely motivated by a thirst to eat and kill everything not infected. Unlike the usual zombie set-up, the infected humans don't seem to be *undead* per se, and would presumably bleed to death under the right circumstances, but they don't really seem to be totally human either, given that they don't seem to suffer from some of the same limitations as humans and they (apparently) aren't driven to attack one another.<br /><br />The ill-fated students are, of course, infected by the test animals, and the virus immediately spreads throughout England with frightening speed. We black out and join our hero (Murphy) who is waking up from a coma that began prior to the outbreak. He stumbles bewildered through the now-silent streets, almost seeming to sleep-walk through the surreal quiet. And when he finally learns what has happened, that everyone he has ever known and loved is either dead or infected, his sense of loss is palpable. This terrible dilemma - would it have been better to live through the crisis as it unfolded or to just be hit with the finality of it after the fact? - haunts him and his companions as they scramble, terrified, through the streets hoping for a safe place, with food, with water, with some semblance of normalcy.<br /><br />When the few survivors tune into an automated radio message promising a cure for the infection, they are forced to make a choice. Their supplies are rapidly dwindling, but they are for the moment safe. They have no guarantee that the automated message isn't a hoax or a false promise. Do they sacrifice their current safety for hope? And also, do they sacrifice themselves for each other in the name of family and friendship or is it truly "every man for himself" in this bleak world?<br /><br />The car journey to the radio message has an almost dream-like quality. Although they are in danger, the survivors are still overwhelmed by the beauty of the countryside and the simple pleasures of a preserved tin of peaches. The dream can't last, however, and when they are picked up and taken to safety by a group of soldiers being led by a rapidly-descending-into-madness commander, they are shocked to learn that the soldiers plan to "survive" the infection by holing up in their fortress and raping any women and children they can find in order to perpetuate the species and generally pass the time. And here we are presented with new dilemmas, not the least of which is whether a human foe can be more frightening and dangerous than a zombie foe.<br /><br />Although this is clearly not a "typical" zombie movie, I feel that it deserves notice for the daring new approach taken by the film makers, particularly the dreamy, dazed feeling of the post-coma scenes and car journey scenes. Particularly thought-provoking is the question of self-preservation versus group-responsibility, and I appreciate that no easy answers are thrown out here. And the treatment of morality within a post-apocalyptic world is handled superbly, with the understanding that humans can lose their humanity easily enough without needing any "Rage Virus" to facilitate their descent. 28 Days Later may not be your average horror flick, but it is definitely worth a look.<br /><br />This movie provides closed captions for the hearing impaired.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>I was very dissapointed having walked out of this film when it was first released.  I was promised the scariest movie ever when I bought my tickets from the guy behind the glass who proceeded to tell me that he has never been so scared then he was while watching this movie.  Guess what.  The movie is not that scary.  But, and this is a big but, after watching it a second time, without the hype, you begin to see what is so great about this film.  While it's not pee your pants scary, the intensity that builds is more of a mental "what would you do if this happened to you" type scare.  It's meant to attack your subconscious, making you place yourself in the scene and then decide how you'd react.  Cillian Murphy has proven this past year that he is a great acter, but this is the first I'd ever seen of him, and after watching I already knew he was a star in the making.  The film has it's cult following and it has it's fans, it also has die-hard haters as well.  This is a film to watch with no expectations because it won't make you shudder or close your eyes in fear like so many newer horror films will (as far as scares are concerned the remake TCM is much much more effective) but as far as originality and yes, brilliant directing, is concerned then this is a film to watch filled with decent acting, a decent script and plenty of tasty camera tricks that will have you glued.  Just don't expect to lose sleep over it.</p></br><a href="../users/A20DZX38KRBIT8.html">A20DZX38KRBIT8</a><br/><p>What do you do when all hope is gone, and a deadly plague has crippled humanity, law, and order.

Soon, he is saved by 2 people who tell him about the deadly rage outbreak thats infecting all of the areas around them. When one of the crew gets bit, they leave and find a man and his child locked up in a abandoned apartment complex. Soon, all 4 journey out again to go towards where the military said they'd be and they make it but they lose another member, so Jack, the woman and the girl named Hannah are at the safe house or mansion, led by a nasty Christopher Eccleston (Shallow Grave, Jude). He says the message they sent was to woe in any women because the men he is in charge with are going crazy without it....so, Jack, the woman and Hannah are stuck inside the mansion with the insane soldiers and outside are the zombie like infected people. A completely good original movie with fun and clever and horror ideas that make and glue the whole story together.....you know, just think...what would you do if that happened to your hometown...you'd panic like hell and run very fast. A winner in my book. Also starring Brenden Gleeson (Tailor Of Panama, Dark Blue)</p></br><a href="../users/A25ZVI6RH1KA5L.html">A25ZVI6RH1KA5L</a><br/><p>So, did writer Alex Garland (The Beach, Halo) and director Danny Boyle (Shallow Grave, Trainspotting) re-invent the wheel with the release of the film 28 Days Later...(2002)? I wouldn't say so, but they did serve to give the medium in general a good, swift, revitalizing kick in the gonsaticles, something every genre needs now and again as to not grow overly complacent or stale. Appearing in the film is Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins, Red Eye), Naomie Harris (Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest), and Christopher Eccleston (Gone in Sixty Seconds, The Others, "Doctor Who"). Also appearing is Brendan Gleeson (Cold Mountain, The Village, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire), Megan Burns (Liam), and Noah Huntley (Event Horizon, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe).<br /><br />As the story begins we find ourselves in a research laboratory specifically one that seems to deal with chimpanzee monkeys. The lab looks relatively deserted (except, of course, for the test simian test subjects), that is until a small group of masked individuals enters...ah, the activists...anyway, a hapless technician walks in on the group and warns them some of the monkeys are infected with some particularly nasty and infectious virus known as `Rage', and that they should avoid letting the animals loose. Of course they don't listen, brimming with their own sense of self-righteousness, and one of the idiots gets bitten...by the way, I don't think they're idiots for their beliefs towards not using animals for such testing, but they are idiots for thinking it a good idea to let loose monkeys infected with who knows what...so much so I'd be lying if I said I didn't find some enjoyment in seeing the troupe reap the bloody benefits given their obviously overwhelming sense of self satisfaction. Anyway, it's 28 days later, as indicated by some text on the screen, and we're in a hospital. A man named Jim (Murphy) in a bed wakes and notices there's no one else around...the hospital is literally vacant. Not only that, but the city streets of London are the same. Newspapers indicate some sort of mass evacuation, but it seems not everyone has gone...a visit to a church yields a meeting of sorts with a few crazed, bloodthirsty, infected individuals, who Jim manages to escape from aided by a couple of norms, one of them named Selena (Harris). They fill Jim in on current events (seems Jim's been in a coma for the last month due to an accident), and Selena imparts a few rules to live by...after a visit to Jim's parents house, they hook up with a tower block dweller named Frank (Gleeson), and his daughter Hannah (Burns), and all decide to hit the road based on a pre-recorded, repeating radio broadcast promising salvation from the madness. The wanderers eventually find the source of the message, in a small, grabasstic military group holed up in a large, country estate, led by someone named Major Henry West (Eccleston), but not necessarily salvation as the unit has their own designs for the travelers, especially the ladies...<br /><br />This seems to be an important point to many, so it's probably worth mentioning...the term `zombie' is never once used within the film (as far as I can tell), and, in a traditional sense, those suffering from the disease do not appear dead, just overly prone to unspeakable acts of extreme violence, and thereby aren't really zombies (at least not of the George Romero/walking dead variety). As far as consuming the flesh of the living, I really couldn't say...there did seem to be a tendency to bite, and I suppose those `infected' would have to turn on the `norms' if only because their madness would prevent them recognizing any other viable source of food (tinned meats, canned fruits and vegetables, etc.), but I never really saw a close up sequence of the infected feasting on flesh featured in the film. The `Rage' virus seemed odd if only because it drove its victims not to randomly attack anything in general, but rather only those not yet infected (the infection passes easily enough, especially given the infected's penchant for projectile vomiting). Why should the homicidal loonies not attack each other, focusing rather on those not yet affected? I'm unsure, and it's never related in the story...oh well, a lot of things are left open ended, so it was no big deal. The one aspect I really liked about this film was when Cillian Murphy's character first woke, and then began wandering around the city, unaware of that which had transpired during his Rip Van Winkle impersonation. There was an entirely spooky feeling seeing him walking these streets that should have been normally teeming with life, hustling and bustling crowds all intent on fulfilling whatever purpose they have at the moment. Does the plot here offer up anything we really haven't seen before? Not really, but what it does do is give it a good once over, sort of a fresh spin, and juice things up in general. I had a lot of fun with this film for the first half (the flaming `Ragers' were amazing, and the gas station explosion sequence incredible), but then things got a little draggy during the latter half of the movie, after the initial group hooks up with the military types running their own program. I spoke earlier how director Boyle `juiced things up'...one way he did this was by shooting the film (a majority of it) using digital cameras. The effect is to sort of break down the barrier between the screen and the audience, almost like your watching live TV rather than scenes choreographed for a film. All in all a strong film with a solid sense of direction, despite the story getting a little predictable near the end.<br /><br />The anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) picture on this DVD is clear, sharp, and exceptionally clear, and the Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround audio comes through clean. As far as extras, there's quite a bit including a commentary track with director Boyle and writer Garland, six deleted scenes with optional commentary, still photo galleries, a music video, animated storyboards, a `making of' featurette titled `Pure Rage: The Making of 28 Days Later', and three, alternate endings...the first is slightly more depressing than the one actually used in the film, the second a little less so, introducing a relatively new character to replace one that got lost, and then the third, titled the `Radical Alternative Ending' excludes virtually the last third of the film, offering a completely different tale all together.<br /><br />Cookeiman108<br /><br />If I learned anything from this film it's that Cillian Murphy can't grow a decent beard to save his life...</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>A group of animal rights activists unleash a deadly virus when they attempt to free infected chimpanzees from a primate research facility. 28 days later, Jimmy (Cillian Murphy) awakes in his hospital bed to find himself alone. The entire city of London seems at first to be deserted. Unfortunately, it hasn't been entirely abandoned: most of the remaining population are infected humans whom the virus has transformed into homicidal maniacs in a constant state of rage. Jimmy encounters a few remaining sane individuals: Selena (Naomie Harris), a fiercely independent woman who won't hesitate to do anything that might enable her to survive, and Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns), whose close relationship has given them a less cynical outlook. Together they set out to find the source of a continual radio broadcast, hoping they will find safety and other uninfected humans. But as the saying goes, you should be careful what you wish for.<p>&quot;28 Days Later&quot; is not so much a horror movie in the traditional sense as it is a gruesome philosophical drama. There is a lot of slaughter and a great deal of blood. There is only one scene that I found disturbingly violent, but the film is grisly enough to merit a warning that  sensitive persons should avoid it. Blood and guts don't actually seem to be the point of the film, though. It's about the rage that dwells within human beings, and it's a philosophical treatise on the nature of violence. Balancing the obligations of a horror film with those of a broad social commentary is challenging, and I don't think that &quot;28 Days Later&quot; quite succeeds. I found the philosophical aspect of the film to be ridiculously simplistic. And I don't think that it creates enough suspense to be a great horror film. &quot;28 Days Later&quot; was shot on digital video to conserve time and money, and it looks it. It's ugly, but that's suitable to the gritty environments in which the story takes place. In conclusion, &quot;28 Days Later&quot; gives the audience a little horror, a little philosophy, and a lot of blood. It isn't bad, but there isn't enough to recommend it either.<p>The DVD: You can choose English or Spanish subtitles. Bonus features include: deleted scenes; a &quot;making of&quot; documentary featuring interviews with the cast, director Danny Boyle, and some paranoid talk about pandemics; a gallery of still photographs, with commentary, taken by the film's still photographer, many of which are quite good; a gallery of Polaroids taken during production for continuity purposes; theatrical trailers; animated storyboards from the film's UK website; and a music video. I recommend the still photograph gallery.</p></br><a href="../users/A3JXOXKWOIETIY.html">A3JXOXKWOIETIY</a><br/><p>Good special effects and an ambitious Apocalypse virus scenario grip you for the first part of the film.  Animal rights activists let out monkeys with a virus that's so aggressive it wipes out the population of England in 28 days.  The DVD contains interviews with scientists saying, yes, viral pandemics are dangerous.  So this film pretends to be realistic while wallowing in mindless gore.  Pretty much a cross between Night of the Living Dead and 12 Monkeys (without the time travel), a group of survivors travel to Manchester to find salvation in a radio broadcast of army troops.  The scenes of a deserted London are well done (looks like London on Sunday morning 6AM).  All the while they fight off blood spewing zombies.  So one inconsistency among many here is with all the blood all over the place, the film starts with survivors wearing blood-proof full body and head protection, but this contradicts the rest of the film where they are unfazed when infected blood spews all over them.  Of course watching a film with nothing but actors in burka-like covering would be boring, especially for the gore fans.<br /><br />  Danny Boyle directed Trainspotting, and the satire that works there is conspicuously absent here.  I wanted to see thoughtfulness in the script, but found little.  Why is it the trend to make Apocalypse/Disaster films into shallow studies in action, violence, and gore?  For mass appeal?  Anyway the gore scenes are intense enough to recommend keeping kids away from the film.  On the other hand adults can laugh at some of them as they attempt to be as over-the-top as you can get.  Skip it and watch 12 Monkeys or Night of the Living Dead instead.</p></br><a href="../users/A20IIR0422G3A5.html">A20IIR0422G3A5</a><br/><p>The post apocalyptic story of Danny Boyle's movie '28 Days Later' seems to borrow from just about every other film of this genre, including `On the Beach', `The Stand', `Damnation Alley', `The Andromeda Strain', `Lord of the Flies', `The Omega Man', `The Twelve Monkeys' and the `...Living Dead' movies. In spite of the cribbing, the movie is better, in many ways much better than `Damnation Alley', `The Andromeda Strain', and `The Omega Man', and it equals and surpasses in many ways the `... Living Dead' flicks.<br /><br />One of the movie's strongest aspects is something it shares with `Lord of the Flies' in that it explores the behavior of normal men and women put into this very unusual circumstance, and shows that it is quite possible for baser emotions and inclinations may come through in spite of their being contrary to the well being of the entire group. In many ways, the basic premise is also more interesting than `The Stand' in that the heavy that emerges after the run of superflu is not human nature, but a supernatural evil who takes advantage of the situation. While this creates some very unusual plot lines and leaves room for human frailty to take its toll, it is not as interesting as tragedy based on purely human failings.<br /><br />My biggest problem with the movie is the improbability of its premise and the even greater improbability of civilization's reaction or inability to react to the situation. Like `The Andromeda Strain', the movie is based on a speed of infection and effect which simply does not seem biologically possible. At least in `The Andromeda Strain', the infecting agent was extra-terrestrial. Once you assume an infection that takes effect in 20 seconds, the reaction of healthy human civilization does not seem nearly as adequate as it would actually be if that situation really arose. `The Stand' makes the spread of its superflu believable because it does not have a startling effect. It starts like a simple cold, so health officials simply do not recognize the danger until it's too late and the superflu has spread too far in the general population.<br /><br />The second big improbability is the fact that no larger groups of people within the environs of London were able to create enclaves of normal people. If a squad of ten (10) soldiers could create an island of normal humans, why couldn't a battalion or a regiment or a division or even an entire army base create a similar much larger refuge and jumping off base by which they could recover control of cities after the infected people die out. It is made clear in the movie that the infected people have virtually no ability to do anything except stay out of the sun in the daytime and search out and infect normal people at night. It is clear that since they don't even seem to have any interest in eating in spite of the ample supplies of groceries in abandoned markets, they are not likely to last more than a few weeks.<br /><br />But if you are willing to buy into the two big assumptions, the story and its presentation by actors, director, and technical crew is well worth the viewing time. A bonus for American audiences is the English setting. One can get very tired of movies set in LA or LA making believe it is some other unspecified American city. One can even get tired of NY as a site of catastrophe movies. London and the English accents are a very nice change. The clever camera work in showing the infected bezerkers in a kind of jerky double speed possibly borrowed from Alfred Hitchcock's famous `Psycho' shower scene works well and enhances the sense of near helplessness in the face of the speed on onset of the infection.<br /><br />While this has many similarities with some famous horror movies, I think it is much fairer to class this as a science fiction movie, as the really interesting aspect of the movie is less the danger from the infected than it is the effect of this threat on the people we encounter as the plot develops.<br /><br />The bonus features on this DVD lists `Audio Commentary' by the director, but be warned that this is not audio commentary on the full movie. It is only commentary on a series of stills taken by photographers doing shots to help publicize the film and by continuity staff to keep makeup and wardrobe consistent from shot to shot. The comments are interesting takes on the stunts and the effort to film empty London streets and the M1 highway, but they don't give much insight into some of the basic questions in the story.<br /><br />The story has a few other contrivances, such as the decision to go through a tunnel in daylight when you are trying to escape people who can only operate in the dark, the lack of any weapons more lethal than a machete when firearms are proven effective against the infected later in the movie, and a brightly lit grocery store when previous evidence was the fact that central electricity had gone missing. Where were those deadly samurai swords when you really need them?<br /><br />These are minor quibbles and every sci-fi movie has their share. The overall effect of the story is chilling, made even more so by the reactions of the normal humans than by the actions of the infected.<br /><br />Highly recommended for all sci-fi and horror fans with a reasonably strong stomach.</p></br><a href="../users/ALN0TTRTLHA4E.html">ALN0TTRTLHA4E</a><br/><p>The plot of the film is reasonably well known. A deadly virus is released accidently by some enviromental actavists. Its effect is to turn those infected into mindless killers. <p>The film opens with a person in hospital waking to find that there is no one around. He wanders around an empty London before being attacked by some of the infected and then he is rescued by some other survivors. A radio message leads them to travel north to an Army facility and more problems emerge. <p>The strength of the film is its atmosphere and its characters. A large number of American films have characters who are sterotypical. Handsome heroes, stoic love interests played by models who are clearly around 19 years of age with big brests. <p>In this case the main characters are in no way Bruce Willis characters. The hero is a courier and one of the other main characters a taxi driver. The women are anything but shrinking violets. The main female lead in fact is tougher than any of the male characters. <p>The DVD is quite interesting. It has a number of alternate endings which reflect different approaches. The end chosen for the film is a happy ending. The alternate endings are somewhat bleaker. There are also a number of deleted scences in which there is commentary by the director. All of it is interesting and explains the process of film making in a practical way.<p>In conclusion a superior film of the genre and a DVD which is worth a look</p></br><a href="../users/A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y.html">A1TW9ZGRDQQZ2Y</a><br/><p>Just watched this movie last night and I really enjoyed it. I thought it was going to be more of a zombie horror flick, but really it was about the end of the world and finding out how to survive. It wasn't scary to me at all as some other reviewers claim, but it was very interesting and intense. It is slow in some parts, but never boring. I like how they make the infected people quick and decisive, rather than slow and lumbering. 28 Days wasn't as gory as expected either, but it had it's moments. If you want to see a good thriller that poses a realistic way the world could end, check out 28 Days Later.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GANR9I6XHTU9.html">A2GANR9I6XHTU9</a><br/><p>Wasnt the worst ive ever seen but it was bad. It wasnt a horribly bad movie. The begining of the film looked promising and original and kept your interest for the first hour or hour and a half but the end sucked. Started getting repetitive and boring in the last hour. Had promise but disapointed. Id definetly recomend this over the zombie movie Resident evil which was about 1 and a half stars. This is a 2.5 or 3 stars. It had cool looking zombies and an interesting plot but overall fell short and disapointed. Also on the back cover it says ( scarier than the exorcist) - THATS  a JOKE. It got old after awhile and Its nowhere near as scary as the classic horror movies. Its sci fi. Another comment on the back says ( it will haunt you for days) - ANOTHER JOKE. Id recomend this to you if you like sci fi or zombies just to see it but I wouldnt recomend it to you if you are not into that.</p></br><a href="../users/AO4J90YPX5RU6.html">AO4J90YPX5RU6</a><br/><p>...I found myself &quot;un&quot;involved &amp; thinking about what I did earlier in the day. After a very boring first 20 minutes I thought that I'd give the movie a few more minutes to pick up. Sadly it didn't pick up enough to hold my attention. I thought the film would have been right up my alley because I love zombie/horror, but it just seemed to take itself way to serious for it's own good. And it's not really a horror film at all. A few chase scenes and some bloody vomit doesn't mean you have a horror film. All and all the biggest problem was that it was overwelmingly dull. 1 star for the chic that hacked up that dude who became infected.</p></br><a href="../users/A2V3P1XE33NYC3.html">A2V3P1XE33NYC3</a><br/><p>When initial reports about Danny Boyle's &quot;28 Days Later&quot; began filtering in to my headquarters, I exulted aloud about the possibilities of a resurgence of the zombie genre. Could we dare hope for a return to the days when films like Lucio Fulci's &quot;Zombie&quot; and the Romero pictures appeared with frightening regularity? Well, all hopes for more pictures featuring the walking dead, at least in the traditional sense, dimmed considerably after I finally watched this movie. Boyle's oeuvre commences with one slam-bang scene after another before settling down to a rather mundane series of events. An uneven movie in every respect, &quot;28 Days Later&quot; did not maintain this viewer's interest. This zombie picture does not improve significantly on the traditional shambling dead films of the 1970s and 1980s. History will consign it to the cinematic ash heap labeled with the &quot;They tried but could not quite pull it off&quot; tag. A true pity since the filmmakers actually explored a few intriguing ideas that should have worked.<p>Jim (Cillian Anderson) wakes up from a coma to an unfamiliar world. There does not seem to be anyone around, not in his room nor in the entire hospital. Wandering through the deserted corridors, all he finds is desolation and destruction. Litter drifts along the floors, chairs and equipment lie in heaps, and an eerie silence hangs oppressively. Jim's sense of awe about his surroundings grows by leaps and bounds as he walks out into the street. He finds no one, not a single, solitary living soul anywhere in the city. His footfalls echo down abandoned London streets as birds soar amidst the silent buildings. The occasional wrecked automobile and a bulletin board plastered inches deep with missing person notices hint at some sort of enormously ominous event having occurred while Jim slumbered on a gurney. With no other place to go in the immediate vicinity, he wonders into a church only to espy mounds of bodies heaped in the pews. Then, he hears a roar of rage. As Jim turns to flee the building, a priest lurches out of a shadowy doorway, moving strangely and mumbling unintelligibly. The man of the cloth suddenly charges our hero, and the game is afoot. As he races from the church and retreats down the street chased by several of these people, two strangers rescue him by heaving Molotov cocktails at the pursuers. Congratulations. You just finished watching the best part of &quot;28 Days Later.&quot;<p>Jim learns from his two saviors that a virus unleashed from a medical lab by a bunch of save the earth types swept England, turning ordinary citizens into frothing at the mouth zombies fueled by an boundless rage. The living attempted to leave the country even as the virus spread to points beyond the United Kingdom. As soldiers set up roadblocks throughout the country, civilization gave way to anarchy. After Jim learns his parents took the easy way out, and after a close call with one of the rage filled zombies that resulted in the demise of one of his rescuers, he and Selena (Naomie Harris) meet up with Frank (Brendan Gleeson) and his daughter Hannah (Megan Burns). The four set out for a checkpoint that is still sending a radio signal promising a cure. After a lengthy trip that bonds the four together, they discover that the soldiers at the military installation do not promise a cure. These motley men, led by a Major Henry West (Christopher Eccleston), are largely content to defend their perimeter from the occasional zombie incursions. Moreover, as time goes by the men begin to show sinister interest in Selena and Hannah, much to the consternation of Jim. What started out as a promising film loaded with suspense rapidly disintegrates into a rather pedestrian attack on the big old bad military.<p>&quot;28 Days Later&quot; still sports heaping quantities of gore, solid performances from a mostly unknown cast, and a strong central premise. The idea that rage could one day turn people into mindless zombies is a good one. When you have zombies, you also have suspense, which Boyle realizes through several tension filled scenes in a dark tunnel and in an abandoned roadside marketplace (shades of &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; in the latter). The use of digital cinematography works well by giving the movie a candy colored dream-like quality that makes the violence all the more effective when zombies burst on the scene out of nowhere. It's so heartbreaking that Boyle allowed the picture to turn into a by the numbers chase movie after the group arrives at the military base. The massive PR campaign launched when this film came out, and the attendant hubbub among the horror crowd, probably insures that a sequel could amble down the road in the near future. The conclusion of the film should quell rumors of a &quot;28 Days Later, Part 2&quot;-would they call it &quot;31 Days Later&quot;?-but always remember good box office receipts never stopped Hollywood from trying. <p>The DVD contains more extras than you would expect on a single disc. It offers commentaries, deleted scenes, a behind the scenes featurette, storyboards, a music video, galleries, and three disappointing alternate endings. One of these conclusions consists of nothing other than storyboards with voice-overs from the filmmakers. The other two offer nothing radically different from the one we get in the film. Thinking about the picture in retrospect, I am surprised that I cannot find the heart to recommend it. Horror fans will obviously see it no matter what anyone says, as I did, but moviegoers looking for a scary movie could do much better by choosing amongst a host of other similarly themed films that work much better than this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3O2RCKAMSE9X7.html">A3O2RCKAMSE9X7</a><br/><p>28 DAYS LATER is one of the most unsettling post-apocalypse film of this or any other year.  Director Danny Boyle tells an end of humanity tale that pays clear homage to a wide range of similar such films like THE OMEGA MAN, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, and THE WORLD, THE FLESH, AND THE DEVIL.  Though the material has been done before, what stamps this film as noteworthy is Boyle's use of lighting and camera.  There is not a single scene that is brightly lit.  Even in those scenes that take place in the full light of day, the audience never gets a clear look at either the background shots or the actors.  And when the camera does pause long enough to show one locale or one face, that shot is blurringly made, almost as if the camera did not want to reveal too much.  Further, much of the dialogue is whispered, so I had to strain to catch the dialogue.  Normally, this low level of sound is annoying, but I had to believe that the dimness of the sound was simply an acoustic variation of a visual deconstruction of both cast and scene.  Claustrophobic shots have been done before, most notably in ALIENS 3 and BELOW, but in 28 DAYS LATER, it is this weird combination of a shutdown in both sight and sound that keeps the audience on edge.  <p>The plot opens with a trio of animal loving activists who seek to free what they consider to be mistreated chimpanzees at the hands of soulless researchers.  Of course, when one of the scientists warns them that these simians carry a fatal virus that causes homicidal mania, you would think that these activists would say 'Whoa' and back off.  They do not and suffer predictable consequences.  The movie then shifts gears in a way that reminds you of THE DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS when Howard Keel wakes up in a deserted London hospital to find that the world has gone sightlessly mad.  Here, Cilliam Murphy is Jim, who also wakes up in a London hospital to find a very nearly deserted city.  The only inhabitants are raging zombies who seek only to bite the unconverted and a small group of humans who seek the supposed safety of a far distant army base.  Frank (Brendan Gleeson) is a bear of an Irishman who lives only to protect his teenage daughter (Megan Burns).  Naomie Harris is Selena, a lovely but lethal black woman who will kill in a heartbeat anyone who becomes infected. As they travel to seek what is probably the last effective military unit in England, movie goers with long memories will recall a similar scene in NO BLADE OF GRASS in which hapless civilians find temporary sanctuary with soldiers of crumbling discipline. <p>It was difficult for me to center on the morally good uninfected humans since for most of the film, their distinct personalities were deliberately obscured by low sound and dark shadows.  However, the last third reveals the paradoxical truism that both muffled sound and sight merely hinted at: the real monsters were not the howling zombies but rather the unconverted and opportunistic humans who sought to prey on their fellow kind in a way that showcases the horror of the greater damage wrought by them in comparison to the less horrible rendings of the mindless zombies.  By the time the closing credits roll, there is a slight hint that all may yet end on an optimistic note, but the combined savagery of zombie and 'normal' human lingers so strongly that the concluding note of optimism can suggest only that the gap between order and anarchy is a lot closer than we might like to think.</p></br><a href="../users/AAECAHBNP1VD2.html">AAECAHBNP1VD2</a><br/><p>Unbless I missed something really vital when I saw this, the crazies in this aren't zombies but infected victims. Zombies are already dead; these folks weren't(and every director doing a zombielike film has stolen the super-speed effect since). An important distinction when you're referring to a film by the wrong genre.<br />That being said, while no cinematic classic, the movie is entertaining, well-photographed, and well-cast. Personally, a little more overall character development, more physical interaction between the 2 main characters and, yes, a bit more gore (it's a horror/slasher film, no?)would've been nice. Certain areas seemed way too jumpy. There's also an interesting subtle nod to George Romero with one of the "characters." The extras are very well-organized and pretty interesting. All told, worth renting at least, owning if you can get it cheap.</p></br><a href="../users/A1E11HKN4IRY09.html">A1E11HKN4IRY09</a><br/><p>I can't believe the hype surrounding this flick.  What starts out a great update of the 'zombie' idea with some end of the world flavor one eighties into something about as terrrifying and engaging as the undead dance sequence from THRILLER.  It's dissapointing really, the film has an darkened look and feel that would've been great given a better script.  A great modern day, realistic survival/zombie film has yet to be made, because this is not it.  Unsympathetic characters are half of the blame and we've seen them before in dozens of genere films.  I hate watching a movie where the players act in a fashion that no human being would behave.  The old cliche where the lone person goes into the dark, creepy room just to look around has been over-overdone.  I understand a film such as this is already stretching the bounds of reality, however can't one be made that's somewhat realistic?  There a plot points-a-plenty that go unexplained, as well as twists that just didn't work, making for a strangely unexpected second half.  On par with RESIDENT EVIL (the movie, not the video game, which is a far better apocalyptic zombie experience than this), which isn't that good itself.  I might have been expecting too much here, but the end result could have been so much more than horror retreads filmed with flair.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Ah, what better way to spend 3 1/2 hours than watching bloody projectile vomiting in high-def?<br /><br />Perhaps inspired by Stephen King's The Stand <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0451169530">The Stand (Signet)</a> where a deadly virus escapes a secret government facility and obliterates the world as we know it, Director Danny Boyle <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001XALTG">Trainspotting</a>  and writer Alex Garland (rumored to be involved with the film adaptation of the video game Halo...sweeeeet!) take the killer virus theme to the next level in 2002 with 28 Days Later.<br /><br />28 Days opens with what happens when animal activists go wild. In a short, violent sequence we see how a voraciously contagious virus that turns people into raging lunatics gets released into society. Flash to pre-Scarecrow Cillian Murphy <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BUYP4Q">Batman Begins</a> waking up  several days later in a hospital bed after most of the rest of society has been affected by the germs. (Coincidentally{?} we see this same beginning to a world gone mad in two other recent zombie-type stories: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1582406723">The Walking Dead, Vol. 1: Days Gone Bye</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RXZL04">Resident Evil / Resident Evil: Apocalypse</a> ).<br /><br />Boyle does an excellent job of directing Murphy from his hospital bed into a fight for survival in a new world. And it turns out that Murphy and the folks that he bands up with need to fear more than just 'the infected'. 28 Days is frightening, suspenseful, thrilling, disgusting, realistic, emotionally-charging...all the ingredients in the Horror genre that make up a Classic.<br /><br />Too bad 28 Weeks Later didn't follow suit.<br /><br />28 Weeks Later is a good Horror movie, but a bad sequel. 28 Weeks (fledgling) director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo dropped the ball on several fronts...most importantly that the Rage Virus was supposed to be extremely contagious...coming into contact with just one drop of the contagion should render anyone 'infected'; part of 28 Weeks is the introduction of potentially immune people (just like in The Stand), and that was not lost on me. But there is 'infected' spatter everywhere and on everyone in this movie that seems to have no effect, and that takes away a lot of the realism and continuity that held true in 28 Days.<br /><br />28 Weeks also fails in the way it delivers its scares. In Weeks there's lot's of scare moments that unnecessarily rely more on focusing on an image where one second their is nothing there and it's a deadly silent, then the next second there's a frightening image crashing into the shot accompanied by a loud "PUNG!!!" (like someone landing on the low keys of a piano). Granted, in DTS 5.1, it effectively knocked me of my chair each time, but it was quite dissimilar to 28 Days where the situations and images alone were enough to knock me out of my chair without the 'BOO!' effect.<br /><br />28 Weeks also breaks down in the reality department where tight, military-secure areas are breached by civilians (including teenagers) and a Rage-infected person is not only able to breach dozens of secure areas, but also manages to appear everywhere in the movie.<br /><br />It's the small (important) things like these that took a great movie in 28 Days and turned out an average sequel in 28 Weeks. So overall, Boyle's 5-star Horror/Drama goes to a 3-star Fresnadillo follow-up for me.<br /><br />Final words: Buy 28 Days Later for your collection; rent 28 Weeks Later.</p></br><a href="../users/A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I.html">A1RP6YCOS5VJ5I</a><br/><p>28 days later really exceeded my expectations! The story of a virus turning people into zombie like monsters seems a little too much like the Resident Evil series, but there is a lot to keep you from making that connection. To wake up in a world all alone, like Jim does at the beginning of the movie, is a fear that no one wants to face. From the start, you know that this will be one memorable thrill ride. It is just incredible how the movie starts off setting the mood by almost complete silence, it almost feels like the entire country is abandoned. It's just incredible the way they present the monsters. There is a scene when the survivors are trying to drive to an army base and they get a flat tire in an underground tunnel. It's extremely dark and while they are fixing the flat in the dark, they see shadows moving coming from the only light being seen. It's terrific, this is the best horror movie I have seen in a long time. Bravo!</p></br><a href="../users/A1EBJ93E1T50RT.html">A1EBJ93E1T50RT</a><br/><p>"28 Days Later..." gets off to a brilliant start.  A commando team of European animal rights activists breaks into a secret lab in the UK and liberates a single chimpanzee, strapped to a bed and forced to watch continuous TV feeds of rioting and other atrocities.  The chimp's rage becomes contagious.  He attacks one of the commandos, and in a fountain of blood, the end of the world is on.<br /><br />The action picks up 28 days later, when Jim (Cillian Murphy, who has since broken through as an actor) awakens from a coma in a deserted hospital.  In a digital video homage to "The Day of the Triffids", Jim wanders the hospital (and later, a deserted London) for several minutes before he finally meets some victims of the rage epidemic... infected, highly contagious victims.  Soon, he is rescued by two uninfected survivors, and they band together first in search of safety, and then in search of a cure.<br /><br />The first hour of "28 Days Later...", penned by Alex Garland, whose novel "The Beach" (a study of European backpackers in an uneasy paradise) was let down by a woeful film adaptation, underlines Garland's strengths as a novelist.  The first several characters we meet, beginning with Jim, are all well-defined and are known only by their first names -- something that you'd expect in a world where last names, like cash and cell phones, no longer matter.  Even those characters who die after just a few minutes are well-written.  The most compelling of the bunch is Brendan Gleeson, who brutally slaughters a group of infected before revealing that he's just a kindly cab driver who dotes on his 14 year-old daughter.<br /><br />The use of digital cameras lends a herky-jerky movement to the infected, and also allows director Boyle to expand on the scenes of devastation (such as a wide shot of a burning Manchester).  However, Boyle's best directorial flourish is entirely natural: after 28 days with no running water, a fishtank is down to a few inches of water, and the surviving goldfish are mournfully confined to the very bottom of the tank.  The acting performances for the first hour of the movie are all determined, yet decidedly not over the top.<br /><br />In the second half of the movie, a major cast member dies in very tragic fashion, and then the military takes over.  Led by Christopher Eccleston, playing a British army colonel a million miles from his recent portrayal of "Doctor Who", a group of nine very creepy soldiers establishes a temporary refuge from the virus.  After an unsettling dinner party, Eccleston reveals his motives to Jim, some of the soldiers turn hostile, and the movie quickly devolves into a tiring base under siege picture.  The action here is well directed, but the content is not quite as interesting as the first hour.<br /><br />The DVD content is superb.  Boyle and Garland (but mostly Boyle) lend a commentary track not only to the movie, but also to six deleted scenes (in various stages of completion), three alternate endings, and two photo stills galleries.  The alternate endings show that Boyle & Garland struggled to end the picture, but that the ending they settled on (shot several months after the close of filming, on different film stock, thanks to an infusion of cash from a new distributor) is clearly the best.  One discarded ending, which omits the Eccleston storyline in favor of a more scientific solution to the virus problem, exists only in animated storyboards, and is well presented with Boyle & Garland reading from the script treatment.<br /><br />"28 Days Later..." presents a common apocalyptic scenario with compelling vision.  With strong direction, a talented cast, and a terrific DVD presentation, this movie is a strong entrant in a crowded genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>"28 Days Later," directed by Danny Boyle of "Trainspotting" and "Shallow Grave" fame and "The Beach" infamy, was released a couple of years before the remake of George Romero's pseudo-classic "Dawn of the Dead," and the two movies invite comparison.<br /><br />While the remake of "Dawn of the Dead" followed the traditional lines of a horror/action film rather closely, "28 Days Later" takes a more thoughtful, atmospheric approach towards generating its creepiness.  While "Dawn" opened with a magnificent sequence showing the carnage -- both intimate and grand in scale -- of a zombie infestation, "28 Days Later" opens with pure dislocation.<br /><br />Following an opening scene where environmental activists unwittingly let loose the "rage virus" by freeing infected chimps (including a nice reference to "A Clockwork Orange"), the movie really sets its tone with some of the most amazing shots of London ever.  Bike messenger Jim -- injured by a car -- awakens in a hospital 28 days after the virus was unleashed.  He is completely alone.  And I mean *alone*!  Wandering first through the hospital and then through the streets of London, Jim does not see a soul . . . and the mind reels as the stark reality of an empty city hits home.  In several shots with no action whatsoever, the film establishes its tone of ominous foreboding - high marks!<br /><br />Eventually, of course, Jim encounters some zombies.  The "rage virus" is lethal, and if the virus gets into your bloodstream -- whether from a scratch, a bite, or, most creepily, if it makes contact with your eyeballs, you have about 20 seconds before you become a zombie.  Jim is saved by two survivors, and demands to know what is going on.  This leads to the typically British understatement, "Jim, I've got some bad news."<br /><br />"28 Days Later" stays on a five-star path through the first half as a handful of survivors (including personal favorite Brendan Gleeson as a doting father) unite, fight some zombies, and strive to find some answers.  The ensemble tries to put a brave face on their situation, but there's a melancholy behind their forced humor that is very realistic.<br /><br />The movie then goes to a strange place.  Our little band runs into a surviving group of soldiers, bunkering in a huge manor behind barbed wire and land mines.  This is a typical "out of the frying pan and into the fire" situation, which is foretold by the general creepiness of the commanding officer, played by Christopher Eccleston ("Elizabeth," "Shallow Grave"), who is rapidly developing a body of work as one of the movies' most reliable villains.<br /><br />The action devolves into a human-against-human-against-zombie climax which is a bit over-reliant on coincidence -- at one point, a character purposefully smashes a car into a building just in time for a zombie to rip the passenger out of the back seat, even though she should have had no idea that the zombie was there.  Whatever.  One does not go to zombie flicks for logic -- but still, the scenes with the soldiers don't feel quite in line with the rest of the movie.<br /><br />That is a mere quibble, perhaps keeping this movie in the four-star range rather than the five-star effort it was shaping up to be.  This movie is scary, scary, scary, and has enough meat on its bones to stay with you after the lights go up.<br /><br />The DVD's extras are good, too, including three alternate endings (one is good, one is okay, and the radical ending is very thought-provoking), making-of features, and director's commentary.  An excellent DVD for a very good movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>Where the best horror films succeed is not with gore but in establishing the mood of dread.  "28 Days Later" concerns itself with a virus that ravages the populace of Britain, turning those infected into flesh eating zombies.  The zombies depicted in the film are not the scariest aspect of the film.  That would be the sight of the desolate London streets where terror potentially lurks behind any corner.  The survivors in the film seek each other out and learn that sanctuary can be found in the North.  Sanctuary is found at a military base camp and this is where the film goes somewhat awry.  Give credit to director Danny Boyle for mounting an impressive, scary picture on what was probably a limited budget by U.S. standards.  As I have stated previously, the film begins ominously and maintains that tone until the sojourn to the base camp.  The DVD contains the film's original ending and an alternate ending that's quite different than the one originally in theatres.  Not to betray the suspense for anybody who has not seen the film, I prefer the original ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Though premise sounds -and is -frighteningly close to George Romero's zombie movies, this entry comes off freshly thanks to Alex Garland's writing, an English setting and British actors.

I recently rented it and was greatly disappointed.  This movie deals with a virus that makes people almost like mutant crazies that go around attacking other people.  <p>A group of people wander London trying to get back to &quot;civilization.&quot;  While the characters in George Romero's classic were interesting and you really felt for them, these characters are dull and sometimes act crazy themselves.<p>The British accents were very difficult to understand at times.  The climatic ending is in no way as good as Romero's film.  In this film the survivors of the group keep trying to catch the attention of some overflying aircraft.  They rig a big message and I guess they are rescued because the next scene is says it is 28 days later and the main character is in a hospital.  Not worth buying.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NM0RAYSL6PA8.html">A3NM0RAYSL6PA8</a><br/><p>It's easy to get numbed by the movies that dominate the theaters. Those that are entertaining, tend to be mildly so.  Those that have even slightest provocative content ordinarily end in silliness, or, worse yet, overwrought self-parody.  But when I was least expecting it, 28 Days Later hit me like a baseball bat across the side of the head.  Except for an ending that seemed tacked on and unnecessary (I would have much preferred an ending where there is dramatic freeze frame--you'll know it when you see it--about 5 to 10 minutes before the real ending), this is film that is a wonder of excellent acting, fine storytelling, and profound intellectual metaphor.  And it couldn't be more timely with the media echoing with tales of super-bugs, monkey pox, ebola, and SARS.  But this movie isn't about a virus, it's about human nature.  About who and what we really are.  And how quickly that true nature could be revealed if a thread-bare social structure were to unravel for ANY reason.<p>You should simply watch this movie.  Pay attention to the low-budget artistry that abounds (it is pitch perfect), the gorgeous cinematography, and the sets.  And to who the real monsters are.  I kept thinking about the riots in this country, and how they reveal something about how close we are to being brutal animals--and that we do a great job of tricking ourselves into believing that we're more than acquisitive brutes.  Keep hope alive, I suppose.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYOHNGQ1WED1.html">A1CYOHNGQ1WED1</a><br/><p>When you are tackling a genre that has been so overdone as zombie movies (ok, they're plague-infected people, but they sure act like zombies) you need to do something different. I'm not a zombie afficiando so maybe some of the things I liked have been done before, but I thought it was exciting that someone became infected within 10 to 20 seconds. It doesn't give you much time to determine whether they're infected or to defend yourself. I also liked the fact that the zombies moved fast, not dragging along like snails. The beginning of the film where the main character, Jim, wakes up in the hospital, not knowing about the plague because he had been in a car accident, is very well done. It was easy to imagine that was yourself trying to figure out where everyone was and what had happened. There is a very creepy scene in a church when Jim is rescued from a pack of zombies by other non-infected people. After this the movie slows down quite a bit while Jim and Selena argue and meet other survivors. There is some talk during these scenes about needing to have something to survive for, not just survive. I guess this elevates the movie slightly, but its done pretty superficially and a little too easily.<br /><br />It almost becomes another movie after that. The survivors follow a radio transmission to Manchester and find a small military band in an armed fortress. They think they'll be safe until they find out the commander promised his men women which is why he put out the broadcast in the first place. Lucky them that the only people to show up are 2/3 female and young and attractive at that. Jim is supposed to be executed to get him out of the way but he escapes due to the soldiers utter stupidity. Then this former bicycle courier manages to out-maneuver trained military personnel to rescue the women. Including along the way releasing a captured zombie, who immediately attacks everyone in sight thus creating more zombies. Brilliant idea.<br /><br />This was a decent movie that lost its way with a slow pace and plot contrivances that made you stop believing any of it was real.</p></br><a href="../users/A185QFJRTB5W93.html">A185QFJRTB5W93</a><br/><p>Why did this movie get rave reviews?  It was too long, too boring, and DID NOT rewrite the "zombie genre" which so many people claimed it did.  I found the the plot jumpy and inconsistent.  There was no real "feel" of terror.  All that being said, I think the main thing that failed this movie was the outside over-hype.  It was nothing that I expected, because if it had been, then it would have been good.  Sorry, can't recommend this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A5X1B2HBQUR3P.html">A5X1B2HBQUR3P</a><br/><p>Edgy, raw and intelligent. This is a thinking man's zombie flick.You wake up in London in a hospital ward. You see the hospital is deserted. You come outside.You see the street is deserted and 10 mins later you figure out pretty much all of London is deserted. You then realise you might be the  only living (sane) thing within miles. Basically we are informed there was a mass exodus from London due to the onset of the pandemic: "the rage" virus which is passed on by transmision of blood or bodily fluid (even saliva). If blood or saliva is orally ingested or if it comes in contact with cells of the body, the infected gets turned into a zombie in 10 seconds and will kill even his nearest and dearest ones turning them into zombies as well. The backdrop of the story is the basic premise of many post holocaust movies. Most such movies deal with a post nuclear war era where the rebellious few overcome the odds of surviving in a devastated environment and live on to start a new civilization. The movie has this edgy character to it. Danny Boyle (trainspotting, the beach, sunshine) shoots the movie in Digital video. Some scenes have this grainy resolution of a home digital camcorder. The movie sustsains interest because it is not a mindless zombie flick. The zombies in this movie are not mindless walking targets of "dawn of the dead" which can be just popped off with a push of a trigger. They are swift, ferocious and very very deadly in a matter of seconds . They come at you relentlessly. They are fast and furious and they are hungry. Good movie...got me to the edge of my seat.<br /><br />regards, Vikram</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>28 Days Later essentially reinvented how both horror and zombie films should be made. The movie starts out with a group of environmentalists break into an animal testing facility and try to free test chimps. Unfortunately they do not listen to the pleas of the scientist they are holding hostage who says that they're infected with the rage virus, so a chimp gets out, bites one of the group members, she becomes infected almost immediately, and all hell breaks loose from then on. Then the story follows a man named Jim who wakes up in a hospital in the middle of the virus outbreak. The gore is disgusting(especially the part where Jim squishes the eyes of a soldier with his thumbs), the zombies are terrifying and they can run, and Jim hooks up with strange people to get to different locations in the hopes of safety from the infected. If you love zombie movies you will love this movie, especially for how terrifying the zombies are.</p></br><a href="../users/A1R8AO9XASQ15C.html">A1R8AO9XASQ15C</a><br/><p>This is a perfect example of style over substance in a motion picture. &quot;28 Days Later&quot; could have been the screen equivalent of Stephen King's &quot;The Stand,&quot; or at least as suspenseful and scientifically relevant as any of Richard Preston's novels (The Hot Zone, The Cobra Event), but it kind of settles for cheap thrills.<p>The movie just isn't very ambitious. There are some brilliant moments -- the opening sequence, with the lone survivor of the plague wandering forlorn through London -- and there are several suspenseful scenes. But it doesn't do much with the material, which is ripe for good cinematic treatment.<p>The direction is for the most part solid but sort of calls too much attention to itself, as if Danny Boyle were saying, &quot;Look at how cutting-edge I can be.&quot; I realize this is low-budget fare, but I'd rather have a cohesive story with characters that I care about than a lot of flash and a lot of mind-numbing quick-cuts.<p>&quot;28 Days Later&quot; (you gotta use the whole title, otherwise you're refering to the Sandra Bullock movie) reminded me strongly of &quot;Night of the Living Dead,&quot; &quot;Dawn of the Dead,&quot; &quot;I Am Legend,&quot; and the thriller novels I mentioned above. The movie is derivative of those other works, but lacks much of their depth. All in all, I was entertained for a couple of hours, but also disappointed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>Although there are certainly some tense moments and a few really disquieting scenes, Danny Boyle's 28 HOURS LATER loses something in the end.  Some of the camera work and imaginative editing are really effective; the acting overall is good.  Naomie Harris and Cillian Murphy are very durable in their leading roles; Brendan Glesson and Megan Burns lend fine support as Frank and Hannah.  The movie loses its steam once it hits the soldiers camp and the typical, cliche characters perform in their expected macho madness.  By the time the film reaches it's all too predictable ending, one feels a little left out.  Many reviewers said that this film is not a &quot;horror&quot; film; than shame on 20th Century Fox for marketing as the scariest movie ever made.<br />On the DVD, the deleted scenes show they should have been, and the three alternate endings are worthless, too.  The third one is nothing more than the storyboard with overacting hamminess from director Boyle and screenwriter Gardner.<br />The movie does have a message, but as far as really frightening, it only has it's moments.<br />RECOMMENDED WITH RESERVATIONS.</p></br><a href="../users/A17NVM7IAPF2NS.html">A17NVM7IAPF2NS</a><br/><p>American marketing unfortunately touts this as a horror film...which it is!  But it is so much more.<p>This is not your run-of-the-mill Freddy Kreuger or Jason Vorhees slasher.  It's a story with heart and emotion, to use an overused cliche.<p>A deadly virus named "Rage" is accidentally released as animal rights activists become infected as a result of their efforts to release monkeys undergoing extremely cruel experimentation.  I seem to recall several in the audience laughing when the scientist who tries to stop them explains that they are infected with "rage", and I'm saddened to think those who laughed completely missed one of major themes of the movie which I will delve into later.<p>Fast forward 28 days to Jim who wakes up from a coma in the middle of a deserted hospital.  He slowly comes to realize that the entire city of London appears to be deserted.  ...  One of the elements that the movie brings out is that our world would be better off if we could eradicate "rage" from our society.  It also brings up the theme that "rage" cannot be caged as is metaphorically brought up in the opening scene.<p>What is so endearing about this movie at times is the camarderie and happy times occasionally shared by the survivors in their desparate attempt to survive.  The love that they eventually share for each other is especially heartbreaking when one or another falls prey to the evil that surrounds them.<p>There are so many aspects of this film and I hope I touch on some of the more memorable ones:<p>1.  First and foremost, the shooting of the film on digital film lending a home-movie feel to everything is bold and it works.  The gritty feel to everything brings a considerable edginess to the film.<br />2.  Some of the visual shots, while understated, are exquisite.  As one example, the taxi that our survivors head north in pass by flowers that look like a pastel painting.<br />3.  Other shots are subtle.  One scene has a survivor hiding behind a mirror...and it's almost as if she is holding up a mirror to RAGE.  The "infected" studies the mirror for a considerable time and although some might think he is considering whether or not someone is hiding there, others might infer that it is difficult for one to face oneself and it is only the possible incredulity of such behavior that brought out a brief human response of self-study.<p>....<p>I recall leaving the theater overhearing someone saying, "That movie [was lame]!"  Yes, I can believe someone would say that about a film that shows more intelligence, human emotion, and credibility transcending mere horror.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>With the exception of the opening 10 minutes, 28 Days Later fails completely. The scenes of the Jim (Cillian Murphy) walking around an abandoned, completely deserted London are creepy and un-nerving. The scenes that hint at mystery and unknown danger are far more intriguing than the rest of the movie.<p>As soon as Jim hooks up with other survivors the scares are lost. Danny Boyle stupidly telegraphs every jump to the point of disqualification. When the survivors leave London and are 'rescued' by a bunch of thuggish army louts it degenerates into extremely cruddy sub-straight-to-video nonsense. I've never seen a film lose its way so badly as this. What could have been really exciting and scary ends up being too cheap and confused.<p>There are hardly any 'zombies' in this movie. Any action or thrills are over within seconds and the complete lack of logical thinking (even within the morally bankrupt army) becomes annoying. <p>It did appreciate the raw-looking photography, it gave the movie a realistic edge but it's soon ruined as the plot meanders and doesn't know what to do. Cillian Murphy was quite good as the hero but the woman playing Selena was too brutish and hostile to be sympathetic. I did like Brendan Gleeson's character but he wasn't in it long enough.<p>Mainly, 28 Days Later suffers badly from minimal plotting, awkward characters, a distinct lack of scares and a corny ending that's out of sync with everything that preceded it. Danny Boyle should NOT attempt horror again.<p>The DVD is in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5.1 sound. Extras include a commentary, documentary and deleted scenes. The cut scenes (and alternate ending) are worthless and not interesting. <p>For a superior and more exciting zombie movie wait for the new Dawn of the Dead to hit DVD. In the meantime, rent this one.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>When I first saw `28 Days Later' I abhorred it.  I really and truly thought it was horrible.  It was not what I expected to see and for the most part was not what I wanted to see.  Then I watched it again because some friends were dying to see it, and knowing what I was getting myself into I actually found myself engaged with the film.  So I decided to watch it a third time and I was completely smitten with this utterly brilliant horror film.<br /><br />Why the change of heart, drastic change at that?<br /><br />Not ever really getting into the horror genre until recent years my mind had been dulled to the films of today with their big budgets and special effects and `28 Days Later' is no where near that type of film.  It's frantically paced, grittily filmed and ultimately much darker than anything released as of late.  The rawness of the films orchestration feels awkward at first, almost unfinished, but the truth of the mater is that it is the most accomplished horror film in the past decade, maybe longer.  It's smart because it plays on the audience and builds a solid foundation of fear cloaked in deep-seated human emotion.  The audience is constantly on the edge of their seat waiting for the worst to happen and when it comes we are leveled completely by the force.  It took multiple viewings for me to fully appreciate this film, but it is one of those movies that gets better with each and every viewing.<br /><br />The film follows a group of sole survivors of an outbreak that has turned humanity into blood thirsty zombies.  As the group searches for a sanctuary they find that it is not just the undead they must be careful of, but that humans in general tend to unleash their dark side when despair and hopelessness take over.  The film carries a far more real feeling to it with the detail of the main characters.  These `survivors' are just normal everyday individuals.  There's no he-man heroics here, no femme fatales, just your next door neighbor, his father, best friend or worse yet, you.  It helps give the film a far eerier presence because you never know what is going to happen to those involved since they seem so unprepared for what's in front of them.<br /><br />The acting is superb here, especially for that of a horror film.  Breakout star Cillian Murphy shows that he has the acting chops to go far in this industry, and recent years have only gone to further prove this.  The beautiful Naomi Harris also sizzles here with determination and a purely commanding presence.  I can't wait to see her sink her teeth into some more meaty material.  Brendan Gleeson is always worth the price of admission and this is no exception.<br /><br />The true star here though is director Danny Boyle who creates a mood and establishes a fear that not too many directors in this genre seem to get and or understand.  Aside from Boyle I have yet to see a director truly create the perfect horror film.  `28 Days Later' is the perfect horror film.  It will haunt you long afterward and the images presented will take you to a place most horror films fail to take you.  I feel it's because of its sheer genius that one may at first be put off.  It's different than the trashy horror films we have gotten ourselves used to.  Give it a second or even third chance and I promise you will see the brilliance that lay beneath its gritty exterior.  `28 Days Later' is truly one of the best films to grace the screen in a long time, in any genre.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NUHWMHA9XNKV.html">A2NUHWMHA9XNKV</a><br/><p>From the minute this movie starts you feel chills...Set in London during the aftermath of a global infection that turns it's victims into ravening rage-filled beasts within seconds...The movie is shot in a very realistic way and the music provides even more atmosphere (if that's at all possible). It is truly a bleak, gloomy movie, and once it stops it never leaves your mind.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Danny Boyle<br /><br />Cast:  Cillian Murphy, Naomie Harris, Brendan Gleeson, Megan Burns, Christopher Eccleston.<br /><br />Running Time:  113 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for extreme violence and gore, language, and brief nudity.<br /><br />Director Danny Boyle, who created fine pictures such as "Trainspotting" and "Shallow Grave", is back to redeem himself, as is screenwriter Alex Garland (Boyle directed and Garland wrote the wretched Leonardo DiCaprio disaster "The Beach") with "28 Days Later...," an interesting twist on the apocalyptic film.  Much like "The Lord of the Flies", the film strips away the civility we all think we possess and demonstrates that we, too, are bound by the laws of the animal kingdom - it's survival of the fittest and to have a future we need to reproduce.<br /><br />Twenty-eight days after being hit by a car, Jim (Cillian Murphy), a bike courier and the film's protagonist, wakes up to find London deserted. Making his way though the desolate surroundings of the city, he discovers that an awful virus is spreading through the streets and cities of Great Britain. Soon nearly everybody is affected by this deadly disease that turns its victims into zombies, who are quite noticeable and different from normal people due to their odd, rapid body movements, their blood red eyes, foaming at the mouth, and their inability to communicate with normal people unless they are trying to bite them. Jim stumbles along a small group of survivors: an intense, badass female (Naomie Harris) with the heart of a lion and a soul of steel, a gentle father (played extremely well by Brendan Gleeson) and his teenage daughter (Megan Burns).  The group manages to stay alive and uninfected, but not for long. Eventually, they one-by-one fall victim to the awful disease and the remaining survivors have sealed a pact that involves them instantly killing any member of their group that has become infected, not to endanger those who are still alive and not yet zombies. As the survivors count their time left, they attempt to make it to a British military base near Manchester where they believe they will be safe.<br /><br />The first half of "28 Days Later..." is intensely engrossing, disgusting, and piteously terrifying; however, the film takes a detour for the worst when the clan of survivors finds its way to the military base in which the soldiers have the ammunition to keep everyone safe and the potential to learn more about the deadly virus.  Led by their captain (Christopher Eccleston), the soldiers soon decide that resisting the crazed, infected humans is secondary to other means of survival.  The film deviates from the terror of the infection into a heroic farce in which Jim must save the females of the group from the groping military soldiers who seem thirstier for intercourse than the zombie-like monsters are for blood.  The slick direction from Boyle is extremely unique and the musical score composed by John Murphy is unusual, yet eerily exceptional for a horror film.  What could have been one of the most distinctive and intellectual horror films of the decade loses unfortunately loses its sight.  An original, amusing gore fest nonetheless.</p></br><a href="../users/A268EEWUXYCA8Q.html">A268EEWUXYCA8Q</a><br/><p>This movie transcends the zombie horror genre in ways that are reminiscent of George Romero.  Zombies are the greatest monsters in "monster movies" because they are your family, your friends.  No one wants to be the one that has to kill their once-loved family member and a great zombie story will work with that in mind.  Zombie movies also work on the fears of the current time period.  For instance, Night of the Living Dead (50s) deals with a downed satellite when space exploration and satellites were new.  In the 60s we had zombies that were formed from nuclear means (the Cold war, nuclear annihilation fears).  Today, with SARS and the threat of biological terrorism around the corner, we have this infection that spreads as fast as one minute, turning normal people into bloodthirsty savages.<br /><br />Danny Boyle (director of Trainspotting) infuses this movie with his dream-like sense of direction.  Portions of the movie are so eerily dream-like (for instance, a car ride that passes a field of roses that look like they were painted there) that it shows a stark dichotomy with scenes of zombies and violence.  It's also brilliantly filmed with a digital camera that makes the film look documentary in places, adding to the fear.<br /><br />Horror movies show the worst in humans.  It is often said that a good horror movie, one that transcends the genre, will have a horrific obstacle or monster but that, by the end of the story, the horrors humanity will eclipse the terror of the monster.  For instance, at the end of the Night of the Living Dead, the lone survivor is killed not by a zombie, but from a bullet.  The character happens to be African American in a time (again, the 50s) where segregation and blatant racism ruled.  His character being killed not by the "monsters" but by a human bullet helps propel that movie past its monster movie mania.  The same can be said of 28 Days Later.  To exactly explain how this happens would spoil an excellent plot twist.  Needless to say, this movie shows the horrors of humanity in a similar way to Night of the Living Dead.<br /><br />Another positive in this movie is the fusion of music with what's happening on screen.  In at least two areas, the music starts quietly, in the background.  But, as the scene progresses toward intensity, the music builds to pounding climaxes that really make you feel edgy.  I've watched this movie countless time, but each time the music builds I can feel a knot in my stomach.  Very effective.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent movie that takes the zombie movie in an awesome direction.  It's intense, scary, and smart.  And, it shows us that sometimes it's not the monsters we should fear, it's each other.</p></br><a href="../users/A2BLITJITO97N5.html">A2BLITJITO97N5</a><br/><p>This is basically the old zombie movie plot updated. The zombies are those infected by a virus let loose on the world by misguided animal rights activists. What sets this apart is that it is well made by the same team that did, "Trainspotting" and that it is British. Good, fast-paced, suspense film.</p></br><a href="../users/A35XMSURGM0L1N.html">A35XMSURGM0L1N</a><br/><p>The Trainspotting team with Danny Boyle have made another good movie. This time about what will happen to England if there is an outbreak of a very deadly virus. It could be a scenario though up by people who know a lot about bioterror although it seems to be unlikely something like this will happen. It's fact and fiction, like a horror story. The virus is passed through by blood, no strange things there, but they almost turn into zombies, and that seems unlikely.<br /><br />Someone wakes up in a deserted hospital, not knowing what happened. He finds a few people and they try to get to the neighborhood of Manchester where still some normal people are. They are not so normal after all and things turn bad.<br /><br />I haven't seen all the alternate endings and would really like to. The 'normal' version ends a little too happy.</p></br><a href="../users/A1V3IO23FZFF9L.html">A1V3IO23FZFF9L</a><br/><p>28 Days Later is a good gory movie. It's exciting, well acted and will keep your attention for 2 hours. The ending is the only downfall. It's pretty boring.</p></br><a href="../users/A13KXWTN0DT878.html">A13KXWTN0DT878</a><br/><p>Going into 28 Days Later, I knew little of what to expect. I'd read reviews online explaining how it was mainly a drama with a horror backdrop, but the American trailers and tv spots led to believe that it was a downright horror film with tons of gore to boot. What I got was the first option, a drama with a horror backdrop. And I found it absolutely amazing. <p> A delivery boy wakes up after being in a coma for 28 days to discover the world he knew is now gone, and has been replaced with empty streets littered with dead bodies, and the occasional lunatic trying to kill him. When he's rescued by a pair of what seem at first rip-off commandos from Resident Evil, he is informed that a worldwide virus has wiped off most of humanity, and has made a majority of humanity insane individuals that live off of rage. Now they must rely on each other to survive.<p>  Danny Boyle has made this film a solid metaphor for today's world, and even states that in the movie of how screwed up people could be. Even when they should be helping one another. This brought a deeper meaning to the movie, and actually made me enjoy it more.<p>  One word that popped up in my mind while watching the "climatic showdown" was "subtle." 28 Days Later is very subtle. In it's storyline, action, and pacing. The acting by mostly little known actors was on. Noah Huntley, although at times boring, was pretty good and kept me interested. The star of the movie for me was Naomie Harris. Her transition from heartless survivor to caring protector was faultless, and her hair rocked. The direction Danny Boyle took was on. He knew how to take emotion and suspense to the right level, and keep you there.<p>  Everything in 28 Days Laters combines really well, and for a hardcore movie fan, 28 Days Later pays off. But for those going in expecting the hardcore movie that "reinvents the zombie movie," they're going to be disappointed. As was 2/3 of the people in the theater that I saw it with was.</p></br><a href="../users/ASHT96DUVMF1S.html">ASHT96DUVMF1S</a><br/><p>28 days was a refreshing movie. Many times the apocalyptic view has been funny.  Showing us our social degradation built upon forges made in technology was truly amazing.  In today&#65533;s world apocalyptic views have taken on a new fear.  The idea of a virus that can kill those around you by turning them into a zombie is horrifying. 28 Days Later may turn into the sleeper hit of the summer.  ...  You can always tell how well a movie was liked once it is over and you are walking out.  Everyone was extremely quiet.  It seemed the movie had touched a nerve.<br />For months I turned away from the commercials for 28 Days Later as I usual do when an interesting movie trailer begins broadcasting. It&#65533;s because many times the trailers convey a different idea or show all the interesting parts spoiling the experience. This situation was an excellent decision.  I had no idea what to expect.  All the actors are relatively unknown but are great. The grainy texture was a lack of funds but works great to add another dimension especially thriller/horror films.  It&#65533;s few and far between that movies come out like this. It reminds me of Halloween.  All the actors were unknown and the film grossed nothing the first weeks only to grow as the great horror movie every filmed.  This is a must see.  Go to 28 Days Later before wasting your money on the Hulk or Reloaded.</p></br><a href="../users/A5KJVGJ43ZDC9.html">A5KJVGJ43ZDC9</a><br/><p>Man, I'm having a rough streak lately! Another bomb. You would think that the director of &quot;Trainspotting&quot; would put out another original piece of work. You'd be wrong in this case. And then the box has the nerve to say this is the scariest film since the Exorcist? Please- it was neither scary or even comparable to that true classic. Last movie made that claim was &quot;The Ring&quot;, and that box lied, too. That's it,no more buying movies with the word &quot;Exorcist&quot; on it. I should know better. Boring, overlong zombie film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>First off, 28 Days Later is billed as a horror movie but if you are expecting ghosts, quaint ogres walking at midnight dripping blood off their ears, or spirits in funny baseball masks, you shouldn't be looking here. The "horror" in this movie is crisp and intense, but emerges from the predicament of the characters rather than the usual gory antics of typical Hollywood genre films. <p>Rarely have I been so frightened and made to think at the same time, and I don't mean only in the cheesy "Night of the Living Dead" manner. This movie is a very visceral and scary harbinger of what may lie ahead for humanity, what with all the biological and viral threats that have become commonplace conversation starters these days. <p>The acting is tight; the musical score clearly shows passionate creation, hear out the samples here on Amazon itself under the Popular Music section to see what I mean; the reel is slightly pixelated/blurry with a colorful strobelight effect resulting from using a deliberately smaller-than-normal frame rate (the whole movie is shot in digital video btw); and the editing techniques sport a very stylized jerking/stroking (remember "Pi"?). You may relish the movie for just the aesthetics alone, if you are into that sort of thing.  <p>But above all, the film evokes some pretty leery thoughts in almost any person with common sense and a basic awareness of current affairs. It is almost an allegorical warning for things to come. <p>Edge of the seat stuff. Watch it!</p></br><a href="../users/A2OU415LB9I5J6.html">A2OU415LB9I5J6</a><br/><p>Recently Danny Boyle won the best directing Oscar for Slumdog Millionaire, a worthy award winner in my opinion. Boyle is a director that never rests on his laurels, recreating genres every time he steps up to the plate. One of his most familiar is the polarizing dramedy Trainspotting, but he's also recreated the sci-fi movie with Sunshine, the kids movie with Millions and so on. Danny Boyle is a filmmaker worthy to be listed among the great auteurs like Scorsese, Hitchcock, and so on. With 28 Days Later... (unfortunately, often referred to as a "zombie" movie, though it's not) he tackles horror with excellent precision.<br /><br />28 Days Later opens with scenes of violence being watched by a monkey on a TV screen as he lays strapped down in a lab. Extremist animal activists break into the lab in an effort to save the animals from being tested on only to find they've been infected with a highly contagious virus known as Rage. Disaster leads to death and devastation throughout all of London. Cut to Jim (Cillian Murphy) 28 days later, a bike courier waking up from a coma in an empty hospital. After wandering across London, bewildered by the lack of people, he's saved by Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley) as he's being chased by the infected denizens of the city. After finding other survivors, Frank and Hannah (Brendan Gleeson and Megan Burns), they hear a radio broadcast from a military installment which houses other horrors for our survivors.<br /><br />While often considered a zombie movie, and it borrows liberally from many past zombie movies, 28 Days Later is not a zombie movie. The infected in this movie are living beings, infected by a virus that similar to Ebola is communicable by blood, and has more affect on the brain than the physicality of a human being. This is important to the message of the movie as the virus represents something that is inherent in all of us and leads to social unrest and the breakdown of modern society, as the virus did in the movie. In this Boyle has done something that he does very well in every one of his movies: creates a great social commentary. Throughout the course of the movie we see that there are those who would fight against a society gone wrong, and those that would exploit it. Yet, while exploring the themes of moral ambiguity, Boyle never handles them with a heavy handed approach.<br /><br />Having a moral/ social message is important to good horror in this reviewers opinion, but how the movie looks and feels is easily just as important to hold the viewers attention. Boyle chose to shoot the majority of the movie with DV cameras, giving the movie a gritty post apocalyptic type feel while also giving the movie a kind of documentary feel as well. On top of that, the DV camera also allowed for tricks that gives the infected an otherworldly look, making them seem scarier when they're bum rushing their "prey". The visuals selected to fill the frame also give you a glimpse at an alien world, a city, or a grocery store that should be buzzing with people, but because of the look of film, it seems even more eerie when you see it emptied of all presence.<br /><br />The acting of course is top notch, as anyone whose seen Brendan Gleeson act would expect, but the movie really belongs to Cillian Murphy who had his break out performance in this movie. As Jim, a man who went down one day in a bustling city, and woke up the next in an empty city, Murphy shows the pain of a man whose lost everything before he even knew what had happened to him. Cillian gives us a man in the middle of a crisis that we truly believe his arc from a pained and scared man just waking up at the end of the world to a man who will fight through all hell to protect those he cares about. Naomie Harris, who also received great acclaim for this movie, portrays a strong woman struggling with her fear and sorrow, but always holding it in, trying to steel herself from pain to come. Also keep your eyes open for Christopher Eccleston, who will become the future Dr. Who a few years after this movie.<br /><br />For as great as the movie is though, I do have my nitpicks. Calling the virus Rage seems a little too on the nose for my tastes, but luckily this isn't mentioned too often throughout. At the beginning there are also glaring plotholes in the scheme of today's society. Why is Jim the only patient to not be evacuated from the hospital? And why did they leave a comatose patient naked in the ICU? Why are there no cars left on the streets of London, or along the highways? A lot of this is due to the budget of the film, and can be explained away, but as there are no answers to be found within the actual narrative of the movie they must be left as plotholes. Luckily, as the only plotholes are mainly to be found at the beginning of the movie they do not detract from the movie as a whole, and will be forgotten by most by the end of the movie.<br /><br />For fans of horror, and movies with a deeper socio-political meaning this is definitely a must watch, but think before you decide to show this to your kids. There is full male nudity, as well as a lot of cursing. But if you're looking for a captivating horror this movie is definitely for you.<br /><br />4/5</p></br><a href="../users/A2ZB8B7VQONZA6.html">A2ZB8B7VQONZA6</a><br/><p>28 DAYS LATER<br /><br />I have argued it for years and it seems that there are still people out there who think this is a zombie when it is clearly not. This film is no were near being a zombie flick as the INFECTED are not dead they are just INFECTED with a virus that was put into monkeys. I don't know why people think of this as a zombie flick but what ever. This is indeed a great film and when it was released one of the scariest films in recent years. I remember seeing this and thinking man this is pretty intense as I was not expecting it. Still I found it to be a wonderful film experience and thought that it was deserving of the praise it was getting, most of the time movies are not.<br /><br />For those who have yet to see this for some reason it is about a man who wakes up 28 days after a virus has struck the UK and turned most of the population into raging killers. The virus which is called rage I guess makes a person go back to their animalistic instincts and want to survive and kill, nothing else. At first the guy has no idea what is going on until a few infected come his way but luckily for him a few other survivors are there to help out. These survivors are a tough bunch and are just out looking for food and supplies and have no problem leaving our lead behind. As time goes on a people get picked off a father and daughter come into the mix and the film turns into a road movie. They make their way across the country looking for salvation based on a radio signal they picked up.<br /><br />Writer Alex Garland did a great job with this movie taking a nice end of the world type idea and making it feel very fresh and very real. Director Danny Boyle did a great job converting the script and idea onto the screen. This film while not at least to me jump out of your seat scary it is still a very intense feeling film or at least it was when it came out. Acting wise one of my favorites ever Cillian Murphy is perfect for this film and did a marvelous job. Naomie Harris was excellent as well and did a great job as did Brendan Gleeson and Megan Burns. Every one in this movie did a great job and I can't stress that enough, great movie I think.<br /><br />I had a lot of fun watching this when it first came out and still it is fun to watch right now, that's just me. Is this a perfect movie, that is up to you but I have a great time watching it. If you have not seen this then I highly recommend it to you, I say buy it and skip a rental. The look and style of this film is great and the road story that is involved in this is my favorite part of the film. The first part of the movie is the end of the world "we have to survive" which is defiantly the horror aspect of the film. Then we get the road flick that is the "we have hope now" part of the film which is the fun part of the film. Then we close it out with the dramatic thriller/suspense part of the movie when the army holds them captive. Could you ask for in a film, I think not.</p></br><a href="../users/APOUYO1BEPK22.html">APOUYO1BEPK22</a><br/><p>When I first saw 28 Days Later, I was really shocked at how good it was. I thought I was going to be watching a zombie movie, but it's really not one (even though you can pretend they are, which a lot of people tend to do). In actuality, England has just been infected with a rage virus thanks to some PETA activists trying to rescue some test subject chimps. Ok maybe they don't work for PETA but you get the gist. And like the title says, within 28 days, all hell breaks lose and England is ravaged and destroyed by people who really should take a chill pill.<br /><br />After the outbreak we meet Jim (Cillian Murphy aka Scarecrow from Batman Begins) who wakes up completely naked (why completely naked I don't know) in a hospital room and it seems he's just been through some surgery. After calling for help, Jim comes to realize he's the last person alive on Earth. Ok not really, but it really does seem like it at first. They did a great job of showing deserted cities and roads and making it seem like he is legend (see what I did there?!).  After some walking, he comes across a church filled with what seems to be a mass suicide. This was definitely a scene I cant forget mainly due to when he says `Hello?' and two infected look up at him really quickly and just stare. CREEPY. Plus lets not forget the priest. As he runs away he comes across a couple of uninfected who help him out. Together they try to survive and come across a radio signal broadcasting help and safety. Together they try to make it to this so called safety.<br /><br />Some might consider the movie a little slow, but I enjoyed the pacing because I really did start to connect with Jim and some of the others. Watching it the first I thought there could've been a bit more action scenes, but after my second sitting, I believe I was wrong. I actually enjoyed just about every minute of it. Also the video quality is not great. Not horrible by no means either, but just not great.<br /><br />The special edition I watched had 3 alternate endings. The first 2 were really dumb and could've been easily just ONE alternate ending. The third though was really good actually. But you have to sit through a story board and not live action scenes, but I promise you it was still good. It basically picks up where the military comes in, but there is no military. Instead they head to a hospital with their little rag tag group and try to save one of their own since the person has been infected. They are told that to cure the person, you have to take out all of his blood and replace it. But this was the problem the director (Danny Boyle) had. How the heck do you clean out all of the blood when one drop could infect you. It was funny to hear how Danny says it though. Nice idea though.<br /><br />In the end I would say to definitely give this movie a shot, especially if you are a zombie fan (even though they aren't zombies) or an `end of the world movie' fan.<br /><br />P.S. - Anyone read `The Walking Dead'? Great, great, great read for us zombie lovers. I always wanted to see a movie for this series, but considering how in depth it's become, I'd much rather see a TV series for it. Like on HBO so we could see the gore. Plus I love how the story starts off in my home town back in Georgia. To cool!</p></br><a href="../users/A1X15AQVSCKKRG.html">A1X15AQVSCKKRG</a><br/><p>28 days later is without a doubt the worst movie ever made, even<br /><br />in britain or america. it is a libelious rip of the "night of the living dead, dawn of the dead, and day of the dead" trilogy that i am surprised george romero didn't sue for copyright infringement. but then again "28 days later" was such an awful film beyond anyone's comprehension that he didn't have to sue. no this film pretty much speaks for it's awful. horrible scripting, horrible acting, slowpacing self.<br /><br />Its no wonder why most of the people who give this film<br /><br />thumbs up are British. British people definitely are<br /><br />hard to figure out. Usually they have good taste but<br /><br />I cant fathom why would they praise garbage like this<br /><br />especially when it's as unoriginal as a Friday the 13th sequel.<br /><br />Yet some of these film critics praise "The Football Factory"<br /><br />a violent look inside Football in the UK through a bunch<br /><br />of dsyfunctional fans.<br /><br />The film's plot is that virus (yes like night of the living dead and romero's flick "the crazies") has infected many area of the uk. jim (cillian murphy) is apparently the only dumb smuck not infected along with a girl named selena (naomi harris). well from here on out these two dimwits and their friend mark now fight of zombies i mean rage people with bats and a machete. lol<br /><br />In order for the idiotic danny boyle to not appear as he is copying romero (which he does anyway), he invents a new plot in middle. see the virus infects people and takes over within 30 seconds, whereas romero's zombies start reacting after an hour or so of being dead.<br /><br />We get some shots of london and manchester but those shots didnt matter as the film is a mess. not even an entertaining mess, its just plain doggy doo.<br /><br />There is another rip of "dawn of the dawn" when jim, selena and their new friends frank and hannah, scourged and plunger an abandonded supermarket to their hearts contents. this is reminiscent of the abandonded shopping plaza where the "survivors" exploit the plaza while the zombies on the outside are trying to get in. what a rip. another scenes that rips of romero is where boyle for shock value has a young boy who has the disease attack jim. the scene ends with jim getting a baseball bat and killing the boy. this was<br /><br />a bit of copy of the dead films like the first one where we see the first zombie  girl in a zombie movie (the girl kills her mothers, then girl is killed herself).<br /><br />Well the copying of Romero doesn't end there because Jim and others find a military complex which is really an abandonded plaza where Major West (Christopher Eccleston), an arrogant military commander attacks the rage people.<br /><br />Well the rip here is that West like Dr. Logan (from Day) has a zombie, I mean rage person on a leach trying to the dead thing new tricks. LOL My god as you can very well see "28 Days Later" is a such rip of the great Romero it ain't funny. However, it's such a poor ripoff  of the work of Romero that the movie fails at every level.<br /><br />There is hardly any suspense, until the last 10 minutes, the characters are horrible including Jim who by God is one of the ugliest actors I've seen. The ending is cheesy and dumb.<br /><br />Mr. Cillian Murphy and others do such a poor job of acting that it's hard to fathom that this guy will play a big lead in the next Batman movie ("Batman Begins").<br /><br />Don't fall for the lies of the critics that say 28 Days Later is a good movie, it's not, it's horrible.I went to see this horrible ripoff with low expectations and I came away still in awe that such a bad movie could be made.<br /><br />There is no more to say or add to this review of "28 Days Later" than to say it's horrible, horribly done by a European director, and poses a black eye to any future horror directors from the UK.<br /><br />At least George Romero can still rest comfortably that his great work of the "Dead" trilogy will not be eclipsed by any wannabee horror directors anytime soon.<br /><br />I didnt mind the copying so much if the movie had a great<br /><br />payoff sadly it never does some people may bash this opinion<br /><br />but it doesnt change the fact that its an awful film unworthy<br /><br />or your energy.</p></br><a href="../users/A10C5CJK1YKGV0.html">A10C5CJK1YKGV0</a><br/><p>A lot of people automatically credit this movie with inventing the fast moving, overpowering zombie. Undoubtedly, the images presented by Danny Boyle of his Rage-infested, ticking time bombs are chaotic and very troubling to watch. Most see this and think in the back of their minds that `when this goes down -- they won't have a chance'. I feel the same way. Seemingly guns, bullets and shelter don't help in any case. The best bet looks like a underground bunker, but good luck on finding one.<br /><br />For the record, John Carpenter's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CY6P">Ghosts of Mars</a> in 2001 brought out the maniacal and unstoppable undead to the screen for the very first time. While `Ghost of Mars' is a very dark and also very troubling film, due to its spiritual angle, it's very forgettable. I was put into a very uneasy state when I saw it in the theatre, but I was forever put into a state of alert after seeing 28 Days Later.<br /><br />The use of a digital camera, hand-held throughout, was cutting edge when Danny Boyle did it for the first time, now Paul Greengrass seems to have made a career of copying his techniques. Note to the theatre going film elite: Greengrass may be good at what he does, but just remember what he did before the release of 28 Days Later is completely forgettable.<br /><br />28 Days Later is hands down the best Zombie movie ever made. The realism  is frightening and dark. The high water mark may be so high in this that others trying to emulate it may only get within groveling distance.<br /><br />Some may have seen this and thought: "hey that'll never happen. It's fiction." Yeah? Think so? Just watch the attached documentary in the special features and you might be scratching your head and looking for the gas cans. Maybe we won't have to fight  off zombies, but being wiped out by plague is a highly possible and very probable future scenario.<br /><br />See you in the next life ...</p></br><a href="../users/A1EKA9XSI641C9.html">A1EKA9XSI641C9</a><br/><p>Get it straight!  There are no zombies in this movie, just very, very, very angry people infected with Rage, the virus.  The cinimatic style of this movie is quit addicting, which I found to be similar in The Beach.

Unless you have a gun to your head, I wouldn't suggest anyone renting this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3OH101U0CPUC7.html">A3OH101U0CPUC7</a><br/><p>28 Days Later begins when some foolish environmental activists/terrorists manage to unleash a plague of "Rage" upon England (and possibly the world).  The story then picks up 28 days later when a young man wakes up from a coma in his hospital bed that goes back to just prior to the outbreak.  As he, and by extension we, attempt to find out what's going on he wanders around London calling out "hello" repeatedly with no one answering.  While he ultimately manages to find other people as well as some infected unfortunates, it is striking how empty the entire city of London is.  Where did all those millions of people disappear to?  We never learn the answer to that question.  As the movie continues and we see the rest of England, we find it is similarly depopulated.  There are nowhere near enough corpses to believe everyone is dead and nowhere near enough infected to believe that everyone has turned.<br /><br />I would gladly set aside an empty country if there were only something interesting happening in the movie to push it from my mind.  Sadly, the plot is almost nonexistent in this movie.  Very little actually happens.  Our small band of characters wander an empty UK and are very occasionally attacked but there is surprisingly little real menace.  When they finally find an organized band of military men, we find that man's inhumanity to man is alive and well as these "saviors" are arguably worse than the Rage infected maniacs.  This theme has been done in virtually every movie of this type since <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005Y6Y2">Night of the Living Dead (Millennium Edition)</a> and almost always in a far more interesting way.<br /><br />The director of this film clearly has no idea how to build suspense, develop characters, or even shoot interesting action scenes.  I can't say that any aspect of this film was strong, or even mediocre, and would urge any and all people who haven't seen this yet to avoid it.</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>Imagine waking up in the hospital, naked and groggy. Then, wandering through the halls, wondering where all the doctors and nurses have gone. Upon exiting the building, you see that the entire city appears vacant and in a shambles. What happened? Where did all the people go? This is how it is for the hero of Danny Boyle's jarring 28 DAYS LATER. London England has been swept clean of her inhabitants, at least those of the normal variety. What is left are roaming bands of bloodthirsty maniacs, driven insane by a virus that quickly decimated the population. The story is good, owing much to both Night and Dawn Of The Dead, The Crazies, The Omega Man, Last Man On Earth, and even The Day Of The Triffids. We follow the uninfected survivors as they attempt to make it to an oasis of sanity they've heard about on the radio. A place that promises sanctuary and salvation for our battle-weary adventurers. Will they make it? What, if anything will they find there? We get to join them in their quest, hoping that they make it before some infected nut gets a hold of them. 28DL, like Boyle's Trainspotting, offers us a ride that may not take us where we want to go. Where Trainspotting showed us the utter deadness of addiction, 28DL shows us survival in it's most raw form. Just watch what these people have to do to stay alive. Watch who they must kill. I highly recommend this movie. Belongs in every horror collection...</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>When a group of Animal Rights activists raids a British research facility they have no idea what they are about to release.  28 days later, Jim (Cillian Murphy) regains consciousness and he finds himself abandoned in his hospital bed after an accident.  He quickly realizes that London is as deserted as the hospital, and he begins a small quest for signs of human life.  In his search, he encounters some ferocious characters that attempt to kill him, but he is saved by two hardened individuals.  They unveil the truth behind the disappearance of the British people.  28 Days Later... displays a vicious horror story about humanity struggling with hope and the loss of hope where the interaction between the characters brings out several philosophical notions such as existentialism, Darwinism, and love.  These viewpoints are brought to life in this dark story as Boyle conveys his intimidating message to a frightened audience.  This leaves the audience with a terrifying, yet excellent cinematic experience.</p></br></body></html>

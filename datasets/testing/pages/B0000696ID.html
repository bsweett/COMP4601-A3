This is a dream come true for every young boy and precisely why watching this movie is such an enjoyable experience.  Recently my wife and I sat down to watch this movie again and she told me she felt the movie was horrible.  I sat there with this blank stare and she said that she doesn't know why she ever liked the movie in the first place. Again, I resort back to my initial quote.  This is a dream come true for every `young boy' and that dream never dies; that is why even as adults a man can thoroughly enjoy this film.<br /><br />I won't say that woman cannot; but I think it has a totally different meaning to the male gender.<br /><br />This may be Steven Spielberg's finest film, and it possibly serves as one of the greatest films of all time.  It is certainly the greatest science fiction movie I've ever seen.  The wonderful thing about `E.T.' is that it becomes a part of the audience; a major part.  It's one of those films that invests itself in your heart; tapping into your emotions and reaching that inner person.<br /><br />It's a film that truly feels like a dream come true.<br /><br />When the film opens our heart is immediately touched when we see the oddly shaped E.T. running for his life as he watches his family leave him behind.  E.T. is lost, here on planet earth, with no where to run.  When he meets young Elliott, the two bond instantaneously over similar situations.  Young Elliott is struggling to adjust in a broken home; his father having recently walked out on his mother, and so both feel almost trapped.<br /><br />They find escape in their oddly matched friendship, and we find escape in watching that friendship grow.<br /><br />One of the beautiful things that propels `E.T.' into the catalogues of greatness is the sincerity of it all.  Young Henry Thomas is just a wonderment here; capturing every genuine feeling and emotion that anyone in his predicament would be feeling; from a nervous fear to an ecstatic curiosity to sympathy and love.  In fact, the entire cast captures those emotions beautifully.  Drew Barrymore gives a very solid performance as Elliott's equally captivated sister Gertie.  She exudes this warmth and spontaneity that just makes her so infectious.  There is a scene towards the end where her genuine concern for E.T.'s survival is exhibited in her outburst of tears; a scene that is so moving thanks to her connection to the material.  Both of these young actors give awards worthy performances here.<br /><br />It's no wonder that this movie became an instant hit and has remained a favorite of many even today.  It's such a beautifully told story; complete with a well written script, stellar performances and a very steady hand by Spielberg.  He crafts a sheer masterpiece here; no ifs, ands or buts about it.</p></br><a href="../users/A37ZOGOK3GKF2P.html">A37ZOGOK3GKF2P</a><br/><p>I received this box set as a Christmas present a few years ago and until recently never opened it.  I have the other standard DVD so I didn't see the need to peek at this one.  Wow!  Three discs.  One features the 2002 remastering, disc two the 1982 version (Just a tad more violent) and disc 3 has all the behind the scenes goodies.  There's the soundtrack album CD and a wonderful book included in this set.  It was scheduled to go out of print two years ago.  If you can get one do so.  It is well worth the money.  It is the ultimate on E.T.  Everything you ever wanted to read, see, or hear about E.T. is in this box set.</p></br><a href="../users/A3S98L5B1SR9P1.html">A3S98L5B1SR9P1</a><br/><p>You can't say enough about this masterpiece of film-making. With enough fantasy to keep you in suspense and enough emotion to fill your eyes with tears, this movie will forever remain a classic with the likes of The Wizard of Oz. A definite must own movie for any movie fan.</p></br><a href="../users/AO461REE0KA4J.html">AO461REE0KA4J</a><br/><p>Before Steven Spielberg tackled racial issues in films like THE COLOR PURPLE and AMISTAD, he had made a film that extols the beauty of understanding and friendship between different races and cultures. It was a seemingly innocuous fantasy called E.T. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL, about a little boy who braves language and other barriers to develop a spiritual kinship with an outer space alien stranded on Earth. The success of this film is in no small part due to the well-developed and convincing portrayal of E.T., a grotesque-looking figure who becomes an understanding companion, a wise older friend, a mischievous creature at times, and yet ultimately a saintly, noble being. This is a rare film that offers a poignant celebration of our good natures. <p>Just as he made an "enhanced version" of CLOSE ENCOUNTER OF THE 3RD KIND in 1980, Spielberg re-released E.T. in 2002 with what I would consider pretty extensive modifications to the 1982 version. Many of the changes are harmless, such as the various re-touchings of backdrops for greater realism, refinements of some special effects shots, the addition of a scene of E.T. taking a bath (to show more of its playfulness), and the significantly re-shot flying sequences that quite seamlessly match the originals. The removal of the shot that suggests a shotgun is to be used against E.T. and the boy doesn't bother me, as it does others. I remember in my first viewing back in '82, I thought the idea of any physical menace to E.T. was needlessly threatening, since the possibility of E.T's capture by scientists was already terrible enough. <p>Some of the changes in the '02 version, while harmless, are unnecessary. In the first shot of the spaceship, it emits blue lights, whereas in the '82 version, they are red (the film's emblematic color). The word "terrorist" has been eliminated from an off-screen dialog, and replaced with the rather odd "hippie." Just before the first flying sequence, the boy plunges down the cliff several feet further than he does in the '82 version, making his movement look a little less fluid. <p>Some of the changes, however, are ill-advised. The opening sequence has been revised to show more of E.T., including an added medium shot that shows its entire body. In the '82 version, we never get a good look at the alien during this sequence, so that in a close-up view a few scenes later, we are genuinely startled by its appearance. The least desirable changes are the ones that enhance E.T.'s facial expressions and body movements. The close-up view of a frightened E.T. in the boy's backyard early in the film has been re-created entirely with computer-generated images (CGI). The overzealous CGI artists have given E.T. a lot of exaggerated body movements, and the result not only doesn't nearly have as much impact as the spooky and haggard mechanical E.T. in the '82 version, but it looks rather comical and cartoon-like. In fact, throughout the '02 version, whenever E.T. has any strong emotion, the CGI enhancements fail considerably in capturing the precise tone of E.T.'s disposition. They either make it look a little too agile, a little too cartoonish, too silly, and a little too physically demonstrative that is unfit for the gentle nature of the film. <p>Fortunately, the 3-disc "Ultimate Gift Set" DVD (which is actually a 4-disc set, with 3 DVDs and 1 music CD of the film's soundtrack) and the cheaper 2-disc DVD set have both the '82 and '02 versions. Both versions have restored video transfers that look identical in quality. (The folks at the DVDFile site did notice minor differences in the two transfers, however.) The Dolby Digital and DTS audio tracks sound terrific, with the DTS track offering a little more "oomph." Mysteriously, the Ultimate Gift Set has no DTS track for the '82 version. This is not a error, for the specifications on the box clearly state that only the '02 version has a DTS track. The cheaper 2-disc set does have DTS tracks for both '82 and '02 versions. Both the Ultimate Gift Set and the 2-disc set have a separate audio track of a live recording of the '02 theatrical premiere, complete with cheers and applauses from the audience and a score conducted live by John Williams. Note that this is not an isolated music track. You still hear the film's dialogs and sound effects (which sound a little reverberated in the recording environment). <p>Other DVD extras of note include a 37-minute "Look back" featurette (which is not on the 2-disc set) and a 50-minute featurette "Evolution and Creation of E.T" (2-disc set has a 24-minute version of it) which offer fascinating footage of Spielberg giving direction on the set and present-day reminiscences from the cast and crew. There is a 10-minute featurette (not on 2-disc set) that shows footage of John Williams composing and conducting the E.T. score. There is also a 17-minute footage from '02 theatrical premiere event. <p>The Ultimate Gift Set also includes a 192-page hard-cover book called "From Concepts to Classic" that is well worth the price. It is replete with photos and drawings, many of which are rarely seen (there is a still from a deleted scene of E.T. entering Mom's bedroom that suggests that E.T. has a crush on her!). There is a section on the many modifications for the '02 version of the film, including many technical details. Also, the complete screenplay of the film ('02 version only) is included. (I also posted a slightly longer version of this review at epinions.com, under the id kevyip.)</p></br><a href="../users/AC16NVPW23KGG.html">AC16NVPW23KGG</a><br/><p>This is the one where Spielberg pays tribute to his friend Lucas(notice the Star Wars toys in Elliot's room!).I swear that this is the same neighborhood that Poltergeist was filmed(I could be wrong of course).Cute  little Drew Barrymore is great, and bicycle flying sequence with John  William's score is awesome.There was a scene that was cut involving Elliot  having to go before the principal of the school(principal was played by  Harrison Ford).</p></br><a href="../users/A10ODC971MDHV8.html">A10ODC971MDHV8</a><br/><p>Spielberg creates movie magic with this warm-hearted yet gripping fantasy tale. ET himself is a creative marvel, the cutest, most non-threatening alien in sci-fi history. The child actors are uniformly good, particularly Thomas and the beguiling Barrymore. "ET" ingeniously turns science-fiction conventions on their head, as the earthling grown-ups are the bad guys, and the alien, the hero. Larger-than life emotion (and tension) elevate this film to timeless family classic, aided by another majestic John Williams score.</p></br><a href="../users/AV1KYJXHOWPMD.html">AV1KYJXHOWPMD</a><br/><p>This is a classic.

"E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial" A film with a legendary title character,music,quotes and it's one of the greatest science fiction films of all time. Aside from Star Wars Episode IV, E.T. is my favorite SC-FI film and overall one of my favorites. E.T. is a Masterpiece, a wonderus gem to behold, the most beautiful friendship since "Casablanca" You could never forget this film and if you insanley did, you might as well forget what a movie is. I recommend this marvelous landmark masterpiece for anyone who loves the movies as much as I do, You should love it no matter your taste in cinema. "E.T.

It's the only way to get the original, untampered with '82 version of this classic film.<br /><br />Yes, here it is! There are no menancing walkie-talkies being wavered around in the air. This is E.T. as it was meant to be!<br /><br />Shame on you Mr. Spielberg for not making this version available outside the deluxe gift box set.</p></br><a href="../users/AEGR40GALMDJ4.html">AEGR40GALMDJ4</a><br/><p>E.T. is one of the greatest films of all time.  It takes you by surprise.  You feel everything E.T. is feeling.  After the movie, it shocks you that you found heart and compassion from something that looks like a mud sculpture.  E.T. also has some of the greatest performances from child actors than in any other movie.  In this film, we see little Drew Barrymore making a stellar breakout performance as the little sister of Elliot in the film.  The new 20th Anniversary of E.T. special edition definately is better than the original cut.  The effects sparkle like never before.  The DVD is a wonderful thing to add to anyone's DVD collection.</p></br><a href="../users/A2I7ZAB04Q0DML.html">A2I7ZAB04Q0DML</a><br/><p>I was a boy of 7 the first time I saw E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, and I remember being so completely engrossed in the story and so completely moved by the tender relationship between E.T. and his human friend, Elliot, that I longed to see the film again.  Little did I know that it would be over 10 years before the film would be released for sale in any form.<p>As an adult, I had the privilege of taking my son to see this same film in the theaters.  The new release, which featured scenes that had been filmed but never seen, was as much a treat for me as it was for him.  I found that E.T. had lost none of its innocence, none of its poignancy, and none of its beauty in the 20 years it had been out of the theaters.  In fact, it brought with its anniversary a new found wonder-that a generation that had changed so much in 20 years could and would still embrace a film that focused on love, innocence and friendship as its common themes.<p>I was also thrilled when Stephen Spielberg released his classic film on DVD later that same year.  <p>This collection is great.  It features the film in its original format, and in its 20th anniversary reworking, with new effects and scenes added to enhance the classic that the world knew and loved.  While some critics have argued that the changes and additions detract from the movie, I think that they are fun, and add an element of joy to moviegoers who were already familiar with the film.  For those that had never seen it before, the new scenes do nothing to detract from the film, or alter the storyline, and so their addition should be of no consequence at all.<p>For those of you who aren't familiar with E.T. (is there anyone out there who isn't?), it is the story of an alien who is left behind on Earth, after his spaceship is discovered by the U.S. government and departs before he makes his return to the craft.  It is the story of a boy who befriends this alien and learns that love has no earthly bounds.  It is the story of children, who unite to help save the little alien, E.T., from his would-be government captors and return him to his own people.  <p>The movie features state-of-the-art effects from its era, and the newly released special edition also features cutting edge effects from today, enhancing the film where limitations of technology left some scenes looking less than realistic.  With a soundtrack that has been enhanced by Academy Award Winning Composer John Williams (who wrote the original score in 1982), this film has a fresh look that makes it look as current as any film shot today.<p>The DVD collection does contain extras, including an hour-long reunion video that was shot for the re-release of E.T. in 2002.  The video features the original cast, reunited for the first time since the movie made its debut in 1982.  The interviews offer insights into the making of the film along with the dynamic relationships the cast and crew had with each other.  <p>This is a great movie for the whole family.  It is one of those rare films that audiences of all ages will enjoy.  It is truly a piece of cinema magic, with a heartfelt story at its core. <p>-Scott Kolecki</p></br><a href="../users/A1B8HI3VREI1H3.html">A1B8HI3VREI1H3</a><br/><p>E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial(1982) is a seminal 1980's classic. It grossed over half a billion dollars worldwide. It was remade in Turkey as Badi and remade in Spain as Pod People. Starman(1984) and Mac and Me(1988) were made in a similar vein. E.T. has been spoofed countless times. E.T. was also released in the same year as John Carpenter's remake of the sci-fi/horror film<br />The Thing(1982). There was also E.T. for the Atari 2600, the video game flop that caused the Video Game Crash of 1983!<br />In E.T., Elliot(Henry Thomas) gives food, shelter, and warmth to an alien botanist after his people leave him behind on Earth by accident. A young Drew Barrymore plays Elliot's sister. Robert MacNaughton plays Elliot's older brother. Dee Wallace plays Elliot's mother. Peter Coyote plays a government agent simply known as "Keys". Carlo Rambaldi designed the E.T. animatronic puppet. John Williams' epic, tender, upbeat music score for E.T. is a classic.<br /> E.T. was re-released in 2002 with new CGI footage of E.T. The word "terrorist" was censored as were the guns in the FBI agents' hands. E.T. is similar to Spielberg's 1977 film Close Encounters of the Third Kind. E.T. also has references to Star Wars(1977) and The Empire Strikes Back(1980). Spielberg produced Poltergeist(1982) while he was busy directing E.T.<br />Melissa Mathison wrote the script for E.T. E.T. is solid on a technical and artistic level. It's one of Spielberg's best.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO.html">A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO</a><br/><p>Even though this is the infamous 2002 re-release version of Spielbergs E.T.(released originally June/82) which has had some CGI tweaking done to it and some footage taken and added,I still found it enjoyable.The said tweaking of E.T. is chiefly of him up close at various points from when we first meet him and inside Elliot's house,otherwise its all the same.Like Lucas with Star Wars,Spielberg took the "it's mine and I can do what I want with it" path,which it is and he has every right to do so.I am usually the first person to deride such cavalier attitudes when it comes to changing the original artistic intent and integrity of a movie.You just do NOT,period,and if you do you at least make available the original along side the newer version for comparison ,like Lucas finally did with Star Wars and Spielberg did after many years with Close Encounters.At one point both version were available(in Canada)but as of this writing that set is long gone to the Yukon;that's out of print for those in Newark.So what we have to work with is this version and I must grudgingly admit it is good.The CGI tweaking and insertion of newer footage is kept to a minimum and if you didn't know where to look you might not even notice it.<br />The story is well known.In California,in a typical suburban environment,out in the local woods one evening aliens are about.They are on a gathering expedition when one wanders off too far from its ship.When government agents come onto the scene in their pick ups the little E.T. flees to his spacecraft but he is too late and becomes stranded.The alien wanders into a backyard and into a shed just as Elliot is bringing in a pizza.He runs in the house but no one believes him.The next night he camps out and encounters his worst fear;a squat,funny shaped alien,or something, from who knows where.Elliot lures it into the house and into his room.One by one his brother,then sister are introduced to E.T.Right away it is apparent this strange creature has bonded deeply with Elliot who becomes his sworn protector and feels everything the alien does.<br />Through many cloak and dagger moments and just plain luck,little E.T. just missesbythismuch,getting seen by the mother.When she does finally see the creature it is terribly sick.E.T. with Elliots help has already fashioned a crude electronic device to contact his fellow aliens but being out of his natural element for so long has finally taken its toll.<br />The government people at the beginning of the film have been searching the area high and low and they finally pin E.T.'s location down and "invade" Elliot's home.They attempt to save the creatures life but to no avail.As Elliot spends some last moments with his dear friend now in a cryo-tube,E.T. suddenly pops to life.With the help of his brother he smuggles E.T. out but is pursued by local and government authorities.Elliot,his brother and three other friends on bicycles out outmaneuver them all and get the alien back to the original landing area just in time.E.T.bids Elliot and his family a tearful farewell.<br />E.T.is just a delight to watch,and really talks to the kid inside all of us.Even the head government agent admits that he was like Elliot when he was young and has been searching for answers all of his life;an atypical response but a nice one which fits the mood beautifully.E.T. himself was certainly one heck of a creation and Spielberg and company did a masterful job of bringing him to life on the big screen.Henry Thomas as Elliot and little Drew Barrymore as sister Gertie are stand outs.Spielberg had a certain vision of suburbia back in the 70s and 80s that while was refreshing to see was still a little tainted.His portrayal of tweens and teens as wisecracking Abbot and Costello`s,in front of and interacting with,parents was a little beyond believable.<br />Technically the DVD has been transferred into a 1:85:1 a/r and is clear and crisp.Extras include an audio track of the score,the trailer,a cast reunion,photos and a space tour.<br />All in all an enjoyable Spielberg film.The 2002 version includes minimal tweaks of E.T.with some CGI and some added and subtracted footage.It's not the original but it's the next best thing.I hope Universal re-releases E.T. in both versions again soon.Recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A29R4FCO6RFX4K.html">A29R4FCO6RFX4K</a><br/><p>Both versions of Steven Spielberg's masterpiece are available on this limited edition DVD of E.T- THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL. The original 1982 and the 2002 re-mastered version are equally impressive. The minor cuts and restored footage doesn't add much. Sure, the CG E.T is impressive and there are some great moments put back in that make the film feel more complete. But the heart of the film stays the same. Differing from Spielberg's more strident films (JAWS, the INDIANA JONES films and JURASSIC PARK), E.T is the simple story of Elliot (Henry Thomas) who finds a friend from space and helps him to find his way home, hence the oft-quoted line &quot;E.T phone home!&quot;. The iconic image of Elliot riding past the moon is one of the most memorable movie moments in cinema history, accompanied by John William's whimsical score (Another coup-de-grace par-excellence). The film itself is still emotionally involving and the peformances of the principal actors, especially Henry Thomas and Drew Barrymore are fantastic. Regardless of the film's 2002 theatrical dissapointment, Spielberg's masterful storytelling holds up to this day. One of my all-time favourites, E.T will always be remembered as one of the greatest cinema experiences in film history.<br />The DVD extras are very impressive. Startting off with Disc One, the 2002 version has an introduction by Steven Spielberg, a live performance of John Williams conducting at the 2002 premiere and an &quot;exciting space exploration&quot;. Disc Two has the 1982 version. the extras include a &quot;Spotlight on Location&quot; featurette, The Reunion: The cast and filmmakers talk sbout the film. The Evolution and Creation of ET: hundreds of production photographs, conceptual drawings and original advertising in an interactive environment. Also included are theatrical trailers and DVD-ROM features. A must have DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A28B7IJR80M8KE.html">A28B7IJR80M8KE</a><br/><p>As a "Star Wars" fan, I have to admit, George Lucas' 1977 grand epic movie DID NEED to be fixed, Lucas totally buffed up its Special effects, which it needed, SW Special Edition is phenominal compared to its original version, however I don't feel the same way about E.T., I mean what really needed to be fixed????, SW was Sci-Fi, so naturally it needed it, E.T. had very little effects in the way of visuals, I don't know what Speilberg is thinking, I mean, is he trying to compete with Lucas in a friendly way??, You can bet I will be watching the 1982 version, this film really is a timeless classic about an alien left behind on earth who soon befriends Elliott, a 10 year old who lives in what appears to be the valley of Los Angeles, Elliot & E.T. share a special bond, it is every lonely kid's dream, I was 11 when I first saw it, it hit home, because at the time I was new in my neighborhood, & my mom had just gone through a divorce too, I was an only child too, so you can imagine, E.T. always heightened my spirits, this film is great in that it shows what a fun character E.T. could be, the original puppet used was by all accounts well done, why they felt the need to digitally enhance E.T. is beyond me, we have never seen Jar Jar Binks as a puppet, so we don't think much about it, but E.T. you do, had digital technology been possible in 1982, then maybe it wouldn't matter, but now it does, another flaw is the removed guns from the government agents, (another mistake), why be politically correct??, I mean lets face it, agents hell bent on capturing an alien would not be so kid-friendly, in all reality they would be pursuing with guns, not walkie-talikes!..., Speilberg should have left this treasure alone, I can understand Lucas' argument on SW, but this one had little in the way of visual effects, I say stick with the original version & skip the 2002 version, the original may cost more, but it is worth it.</p></br><a href="../users/A1M9DQDGE07Q0U.html">A1M9DQDGE07Q0U</a><br/><p>E.T. finally makes its way to DVD via two versions, the original theatrical cut and the 2002 remastered and retouched version that director Steven Spielberg revisited.  I must confess, the differences between the two versions are minimal, reminding me of how well done the effects were the first time around.  Still, the subtle added touches that have been incorporated into the 2002 cut, while I don't feel add anything fresh to the enjoyment of the film, nevertheless, don't detract from its enjoyment either.  Hello George Lucas, are you getting any of this?<br />Universal has done a masterful job with the transfer of both editions.  Shadow delineation and contrast are superbly rendered.  Colors are well balanced.  The soundtrack has been marvelously restored with John Williams' memorable score jumping out of the speakers in this 5.1 remix.  The extras include a making of documentary and some fluff regarding the reissue.  Candid moments caught by the documentary reveal that neither Henry Thomas or Drew Barrymore looking thrilled to be revisiting the film, perhaps because neither's career reached quite so high after the original theatrical engagement.  Oh, well, this is definitely a nice job by Universal and well worth the wait.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z2ZN39LL07GI.html">A1Z2ZN39LL07GI</a><br/><p>i love this movie .. i remember when i kids see this movie. and i love with this edition .. 4 disc and a lot of bonus inserted it. And i will buy blu-ray edition i hope good transfer than oldies</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p>What can I say about this film? It captures the height of sci-fi/fantasy cinema during the late 1970s/early 1980s in all of its glory. The three kids all pull off their parts wonderfully (this movie was easily Drew Barrymore's best role). E.T. comes across as extremely convincing, largely due to the excellent puppet used.<br /><br />And about that puppet - in 2002, Spielberg made a few CG enhancements to the movie. I think most of the changes were for the better. Sometimes the CG E.T. looks a bit too C.G., but other times CG does enable him to exhibit a greater range of facial expressions. I think much of it still works because the actors used the original C.G. puppet, so they were able to give better performances than would have been possible otherwise.<br /><br />I also think replacing the guns with walkie-talkies was an acceptable move. While I don't care much for being politically correct, it always did seem a bit odd to me that NASA agents were chasing a bunch of kids while brandishing rifles. They obviously didn't plan to shoot the kids, otherwise they would have. Either way, Spielberg includes the 1982 original version - unlike Lucas - so you can enjoy the movie either way.<br /><br />During the Cold War, the U.S. showed Soviet defectors this movie to introduce them to the potential and imagination of the American way of life. Nowadays, I wish more producers would revisit this movie to try to recapture some of that movie magic we kids enjoyed during there 1980s.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>Regarded by many as being one of the greatest motion pictures of all-time, "ET" will always hold a special place in people's hearts as being a film that deals with the importance of friendship despite the differences between people. The movie is about a young boy who befriends an alien creature known as ET when ET is left behind by his mother spaceship. Steven Speilberg, who directed the movie, based ET on his imaginary friend that he made up in the early sixties when his parents divorced. To Speilberg ET was the brother he never had and the father that he was about to lose. The basis of the story stayed with Speilberg for years, if anything it haunted him, and it wasn't until the early eighties that he was able to get a script written and the project greenlighted by the studio. The movie was filmed in Southern California and most of the cast consisted of young child actors, sometimes an omen for movie makers. However, Speilberg got a taste of working with children after "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", and he has gone on record as saying the "ET" shoot was one of his most memorable due to his working with Drew Barrymore, Henry Thomas, and other kids.<br /> A film that never ages, "ET" has consistently shown up on "best movie lists" time and time again, with "Time" writing that "ET" is one of the best motion pictures ever.<br /> The DVD is filled with bonuses including interviews with those who worked on the film (now grown adults) as well as Speilberg, commentary, trailers, and more. As of 2010 "ET" has grossed nearly $800,000,000 making it one of this biggest blockbusters in movie history. The budget of the film was moderately low, at $10,000,000.</p></br><a href="../users/ACKDSX71VI5HY.html">ACKDSX71VI5HY</a><br/><p>SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />I am old enough(barely)to remember the first release of "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial" back in 1982.  I was four years old, and on vacation with my family to see my aunt in Baytown, Texas.  It was the first movie I ever saw in a theatre, and I remain thankful for having seen this on a big screen at a young age.<br /><br />Directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Henry Thomas, Drew Barrymore and Robert MacNaughton, the movie tells the story of the unlikely friendship between a young boy named Elliott and an alien.  That is a very rough outline, but the ingeniousness of the movie is the emphasis of the deep need for connection and understanding between people.  Elliott is loved, but frustrated by an absentee father and the typical harrassments of an older brother named Michael, played well by Robert MacNaughton.  Additionally, Elliott must contend with the responsibility of occasionally looking after his younger sister Gertie, played by a very young and endearing Drew Barrymore.  E.T. unceremoniously lands in Elliott's life and care after being unintentionally stranded on Earth by his kind, and the flowering of their relationship remains one of the most moving in the history of popular film.<br /><br />All of the younger actors in this movie give exceptional performances, but Henry Thomas' Elliott remains among the best child performances ever put on film.  Mr. Thomas plays Elliott as if he were a genuine boy, and naturally elicits sympathy and believability.<br /><br />Also featuring a superlative soundtrack by the great film composer John Williams(the "Star Wars", "Indiana Jones" and "Harry Potter" film series'), and impressive visual effects punctuated by a couple of famous bicycle flights, "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial" is a great classic film that I never tire of watching.  (And yes, I did cry at the end, all those years ago).</p></br><a href="../users/A1T3O2LILVK0C4.html">A1T3O2LILVK0C4</a><br/><p>-This review pertains to the .<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CX9Q">E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial (Widescreen Collector's Edition)</a>and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000069AT7">E.T. - The Extra-Terrestrial (Ultimate Gift Boxed Set)</a>*-<br /><br />E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial is in all likelihood the most personal film that Steven Spielberg has directed. It gives insight into the director's life experiences and his childhood in particular. For the most part the film is shown through the eyes of a child. It captures a certain sense of innocence and wonderment that was rare in films of the early 1980s. It's also startlingly honest in its portrayal of children growing up in contemporary America. Rarely do films give a truthful account of what the social behavior of children is really like. These children playfully torment one another, they swear and most importantly they aren't always good to each other. As a child, I recognized this and I still find it intriguing that one of the most accurate views of childhood should be found within a science fiction film. No wonder the story still touches people today.<br /><br />The story concerns an alien (who happens to be a botanist) that is stranded on Earth. Government agents pursue him so he retreats into the vast forests of Northern California. One night a ten-year-old boy named Elliott sees him. Soon the two become friends and a symbiotic bond is formed. E.T., as the alien is dubbed, comes from a distant planet where his species experience reality through a collective conscious. Without his species he cannot emote, maintain physical health and therefore his life is endangered. But miraculously a link is formed between E.T. and Elliott, and this keeps him alive. E.T. feels Elliott's pain and distress, both emotional and physical, and responds to it. Now Elliott shares E.T.'s emotions, which further complicates his life. In one memorable sequence, E.T. discovers beer and becomes drunk causing Elliott to act in an intoxicated manner while at school. Soon the link between them strengthens and neither of them can sustain themselves. In order for either of them to survive E.T. must be reunited with his own species. All during this time the only other people to have seen E.T. are Elliott's siblings and a mysterious man who is only known as Keys. Elliott must learn to rely on his older brother, Michael and his younger sister, Gertie to keep his secret. On Halloween night, they manage to sneak E.T. out of the house, and Elliott and E.T. embark on an amazing journey through the forest. Deep within the forest, E.T. constructs a communication device out of mundane household items and attempts to contact the other aliens. When Elliott wakes up the following morning E.T. has vanished. Elliott returns home to find his mother panicked about his disappearance. His older brother, Michael searches for E.T. and finds him, half dead in the river and proceeds to bring him back home. Only then do the children reveal E.T.'s presence to their mother. But before she can absorb the shock government agents, dressed in space suits and armed with guns, break into their home. Meanwhile E.T. and Elliott grow weaker. And the only hope for their mutual survival is for E.T. to return to his home planet.<br /><br />The film is something of an emotional roller coaster ride and its climactic bicycle chase is breathtaking. By the time the end credits have started you'll either have tears in your eyes or you'll be too exhausted to absorb the film's impact.<br />Much has already been said about the film's artistic and technical merits, so I won't go into great detail about the brilliance of the acting, the production design, John William's wonderful score, Melissa Mathison's script or Spielberg's direction. But I will say that they all deserve credit for this wonderful film. E.T. is truly a modern classic!<br /><br />* The original 1982 widescreen theatrical version of E.T. isn't easy to find. It's only available in two expensive sets, both of which I recommend. Currently both of those DVD editions are unavailable here on Amazon.com, but they can be found in some novelty and collector shops. Hopefully when Universal releases this title in the future they'll include the original version as well as the 20th Anniversary edition.</p></br><a href="../users/A28OB1QLXN5BM6.html">A28OB1QLXN5BM6</a><br/><p>I remember when Steven Speilberg's "E.T. The Extra Terrestrial" was first released, being touched and awed by such a beautiful and unique film.  Everyone I knew was talking about this film; it struck an emotional cord in young and old alike.  It, along with "Close Encounters of the Third Kind", was one of the first films with aliens where the aliens were NOT portrayed as invading monsters, and we, the people of Earth, didn't immediately shoot first and ask questions later.  Even in the classic "The Day the Earth Stood Still", a soldier shoots at Klatu in one of the earliest scenes.<br /><br />This story of a boy named Elliot who develops a deep and lasting friendship with a young space alien accidentally left behind on Earth teaches lessons of friendship, devotion, and love. Elliot and his new friend ET show us the power of wonder, innocence, acceptance, curiosity, and communication.  The scene where Elliot begins to attempt to teach ET to talk via a stream of consciousness naming of everything in sight is wonderful, so typically childlike and real. It always brings a huge smile to my face.<br /><br />I watched ET again last night with my newly 3-year old daughter.  I was amazed.  It immediately captured her attention; she watched it with huge, wide, interested eyes.  As she sat in my lap, she whispered various questions - "What's happening, Mommy?" or "Why are the kids screaming?"  I explained that a young ET had been accidentally left on Earth by his mommy and daddy, that Elliot was searching for ET to bring him back to his house, that the little girl and ET were scared of each other at first, etc.  She took it all in, absorbed it, and clearly thought about it.  When Elliot brought food for ET, and when Drew Barrymore started smiling at ET, my daughter exclaimed, "Oh look, Mama, now they are friends!" with a happy, satisfied smile on her face.  Near the end she said, "He misses his mommy.  ET phoned home." Her sweet, insightful, innocent comments once again brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />This film continues to be pure magic.  "E.T." has earned itself a place in movie history, and deserves the highest praise and more.  Introducing it to a young child improves even the best experience, bringing to mind memories of that first time and surpassing them.  It truly is a film for the ages, for all generations, and will be for years to come.</p></br><a href="../users/A1G9FX1KV45N41.html">A1G9FX1KV45N41</a><br/><p>I was nine years old when I first this movie and it was great seeing again after 25 years.<br />The classic mega sci-fi hit about the lonely 10 year old boy who finds and befriends a gentle alien, is as wonderful as the classic ever was.<br />Elliot (Henry Thomas) stumbles across the alien who soon names himself ET, and soon his oldere brother Michael (Robert Macnaughton)  and his absolutely adorable 7 year old mischeivous sister Gertie (played by a vey young Drew Barrymore in her heartstealing debut performance).<br /><br />Some very memorable  secenes include the part where Gertie teaches ET to talk, where the kid's mother (Dee Wallace)  opens Elliot's cupboard and passes ET off as one of his toys, the tearjerking scenes of ET dying in the scientists medical facility, and of course the psychical connection of ET and Elliot, leading Elliot to experience the symptoms of being drunk in science class when ET is drinking the beer at home. Elliot sets all the frogs who are about to be dissected, free, and As the alien watches John Wayne kiss Maureen O'Hara in The Quiet Man, Elliott's psychic link causes him to kiss a pretty girl in the class he likes (Erika Eleniak) in the same manner.<br />humour includes the boys at school taunting Elliot that the alien he claims he has discovered is from 'uranus'.<br /><br />ET's later illness is paralelled by Elliot's illness and who can forget where Elliot, Michael and their friends on are lifted  their bycicles into the sky, while getting ET past the auhtorities.<br /><br />And then of course the scene where ET before being collected by his fellow aliens in the spaceship, says goodbye to Michael. Gertie and Elliot, and ET points to elliot's heart6 reminding him he will always be there.<br />Some really nifty reminders of the earely 80s teenage culture of the time including if you are really observant, Michael's space invaders sweatshirt.<br />This classic is as wonderful to see as ever for kids sseing it for the first time a smuch as  for adults taking a trip down memory lane.<br />It stands on it's own and was never spoiled by an attempt at a sequel (very wise of you Mr Spielberg!).</p></br><a href="../users/A3LU79BYMWZEW9.html">A3LU79BYMWZEW9</a><br/><p>I was almost disappointed to find out (from Wikipedia, darnit) that E.T. has long been viewed as a  kind of Christian allegory.  That particular interpretation dawned on my benighted critical soul relatively recently.  I assumed that others had come up with similar interpretations and that probably somewhere out there some enterprising film student--or DIVINITY scholar--had gotten a dissertation out of the notion.  So I never laid claim to much originality there, but when I ultimately did make that connection on re-viewing the film a while back, I decided to roll with it.  As it turns out, you COULD make a case for E. T. as a kind of parable.<br /><br />In my own case, it occurred to me that E.T.'s glowing heart (and those of his fellow aliens, also glimpsed in the film) reminded me of something.  Oh, yeah, I realized eventually: it's reminiscent of the the "Sacred Heart" imagery from my Catholic boyhood.  E.T. as a Christ figure?  Then I started making a game of it.  Came down from the heavens, sure, sure.  Has HEALING powers, aha!  Suffers the little children unto him (and avoids all contact with yucky--and corrupted--grown-ups); he dies at the hands of oppressive authority figures but is resurrected and, well, he ascends to the heavens thereafter.<br /><br />It all fits rather neatly, but would a nice Jewish boy like Steven Spielberg really have set out to make a Christian fable.  He joked about it himself apparently, asking how he would ever be able to explain such an effort to his own mother who ran a kosher restaurant in L.A.  Moreover, would a Christ-figure actually avoid interaction with all adults or would he--as the Biblical Jesus did--start to shake up the status quo as much as possible.  And turning water into wine is one thing, but downing a six-pack and inducing a drunken state in the ten-year old child with whom you've telepathically bonded is quite another matter!<br /><br />I jest, of course.  But since there have been serious attempts to classify Snoopy as a Christ figure, I guess the case can certainly be made for E.T.  (at least he's SUPERHUMAN).  What it's really all about, of course, is those universal archetypes that nearly all cultures embrace and employ in one shape or other, and which artists employ overtly or covertly for their rich symbolism.<br /><br />Another little apercu.  In this age of sequels, prequels and spin-offs, it's commendable that Spielberg and crew never attempted to cash in on the E.T. phenomenon and come out with E.T.2 a few years later--or E.T.25 more recently. For once, a story which could have easily been "sequel-ized"  (Elliott visits E.T.'s planet; E.T. returns to Earth and runs for president) was left alone.  A "Second Coming" in this instance could only have been disappointing--with E.T. phoning it in rather than phoning home.  Thank the good Lord for Mr. Spielberg's restraint.</p></br><a href="../users/A4PPZNQF1X2IY.html">A4PPZNQF1X2IY</a><br/><p>Despite a few minor things I would change, E.T. is still a gold standard for cinema after all these years.  Great overall story, yet it is the so many subtleties in the movie that give it an extra shine.  It is quite intricately scripted and edited, which give it a lot of extra character and drama.  Effective soundtrack as well.  Lighting effects.  Worth a lot of study.</p></br><a href="../users/A29QA79VLQGHY6.html">A29QA79VLQGHY6</a><br/><p>In a lot of ways, the two DVD sets that mark the 20th anniversary of the warm-and-fuzzy classic "E.T." feel like family albums. Most of the on-the-set footage plays like home movies. The cast clearly considers "E.T." one of their own. "He was one of the kids," "E.T." mom Dee Wallace says. Charming and nostalgic to be sure, but the material probably resonates best with those connected to the production.<p>Universal Home Video has released "E.T." in two handsome sets, marking the film's debut on DVD. (Some of the material appeared on laserdisc.) Both have the heft of an event release, with fine art direction on the packages, discs and menus. Audio and video have been spit-polished; the list of extras seems mighty enough. Clearly, the money was spent.<p>Still, it all feels a bit thin. Put simply, the sets are not in the same league with well-organized, highly informative titles like "The Phantom Menace," Spielberg's own "A.I." or "Singin' in the Rain."<p>At times, the extras for "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" play like "E.T." the celebrity news show. Spielberg and his actors stay in pure promotion mode as they reminisce. The populist approach should suit fans looking to catch up with the "E.T." stars, but it probably won't sit well with those seeking insight into one of the last century's most successful movies.<p>Both sets feature the original theatrical version of "E.T." and the updated director's cut that was released to cinemas in March. Universal says Spielberg gave in to consumer demand at the last minute, agreeing to include the original film on the smaller set. This may explain some of the DVD sets' problems with clunky navigation and skimpy direct access of extras. Both sets include a second unspooling of the new film as it was accompanied live by John Williams' orchestra.<p>The "Limited Collector's Edition" has a half-hour version of the new making-of docu "The Evolution and Creation of E.T." that runs almost an hour on the larger set. Also missing is the larger set's thoughtful documentary on John Williams, who won an Oscar for his "E.T." score. These cuts removed some of the more informative material, making the full box set the necessary (and more costly) acquisition for those with a serious interest in the film. Both sets are to be discontinued at the end of the year, returning "E.T." to the suspended animation of "video moratorium."<p>"The Ultimate Gift Boxed Set" adds a remastered CD soundtrack, the colorful hardcover book "E.T. From Concept to Classic" (which threads Melissa Mathison's script around some decent feature material) and a "collectible senitype" (reproduction of a film frame). A certificate of authenticity makes it all official. The review copy's box suffered significant tearing at the corners not long after it was removed from the shrinkwrap. The smaller package is quite sturdy.<p>The new cut of "E.T." looks fine, much as it did during its theatrical run last spring. Image quality has its highs and a few lows, but this appears to be the best possible rendering of "E.T." The older film looks so-so, with night scenes on the muddy side.<p>The DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1 sound strong for the most part, providing sufficient vistas for John Williams' sweeping score. The DTS provides more depth and bottom than the Dolby, but the difference won't be dramatic on most systems. In an oddity, the original "E.T." on the two-disc edition has DTS encoding, but not on the more extensive set (this is not reflected on the packaging). Universal says this was a disc-space issue. No matter -- the old sound can't touch the new sound regardless of how it's processed. Limited surround effects on the updated film won't test the outer limits of many systems: It all sounds kind of Pro Logic, probably a creative decision.<p>Buyers of the larger set get a breakdown of scenes that were changed or added, but you have to go deep into the making-of to find the comparisons. (Users should be able to access features like these quickly via menus).</p></br><a href="../users/AE0E6UII0VSZA.html">AE0E6UII0VSZA</a><br/><p>As if seeing the little boy Elliot hug his new best friend E.T. at the end wasn't enough to make your tear ducts burn with the desire to let a few drip down your face, E.T.'s magically illuminated finger ignites with life and casts a warm glow onto the tearful face of the friend he's about to leave behind and says the words that warmed hearts around the world: &quot;I'll be right here.&quot; The music soars, E.T. picks up his plant, and the tears proceed to trickle down my face and land with a nice little plop on my pants before they are absorbed by the denim fabric. But they aren't tears of sadness, like they are when E.T. is defibrilated; they are tears of joy and happiness. This little creature whom I, as a viewer, have become so attached to, is finally getting what he wants: To go home, but at the cost of the first best friend he ever had. No one is good at goodbyes, and everyone knows this, which is what makes the ending to &quot;E.T.--The Extra-Terrestrial&quot; so wonderful. The movie makes your heart glad. It is wonderful, charming, scary, funny, realistic, visually stunning, and exciting as hell. How many times can you truly say that a single movie embodies all of those qualities, plus a lot more that I haven't even mentioned? A handful at most. &quot;E.T.&quot; is one of the few masterpieces I can claim to have seen. It is right up there on my list of all-time favorites with &quot;American Beauty&quot; and &quot;Magnolia,&quot; and it is the only movie to ever make me cry in front of company. You make poke fun at me if you will, but I'm no less of a man for admitting it, so keep your testosterone-seething jabs at my psyche to yourself. Thanks.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2.html">A2HJZ2KN9YA9L2</a><br/><p>Someone in the marketing department at Universal should get fired.  First they said that the only way to get the original edit of E.T. was to shell out [some hefty cash].  (I wonder how many people decided not to bother because of the prohibitive cost?)<br />The decision to have both editions available in one set at a lower price was announced only a week before the DVD was released.  <p>The packaging of the lower priced DVD is also pathetic.  It looks fine facing out in the store, with the clear plastic window on the moon-colored disc, but there is no title on the spine.  Also the cardboard trees over the cardboard window is already starting to peel away on my package.  Remove the security labels with care, as this can also damage the cardboard package.<p>This is E.T.  The highest grossing film of all time between 1982 & 1997.  A beloved film by critics & audiences alike.  Universal should have given it more respect.<p>I admit I have yet to watch the special edition.  I hesitate to tarnish the memory of the original, which still moves and engages me.</p></br><a href="../users/ATOSQVSOA3D8Q.html">ATOSQVSOA3D8Q</a><br/><p>This film has always been quite famous and i can understand why.Famous actors such as drew barrymore that played gertie and Director Steven spielberg a director of quite a lot of films. It is bought to life by a cute little alien E.T, 2 kids who befriended it and took him in to their home to keep. Little gertie is the last to find outabout him and literally screams at first.

Frightened and alone, the alien is discovered hiding in an L.A. home's tool shed by Elliott (Henry Thomas), a smart 9 year old who is having a hard time coping with his parents' recent divorce.  Elliott, his brother Mike (Robert McNaughton) and sister Gertie (a pre-Charlie's Angel Drew Barrymore) befriend the strange being they'll eventually name E.T. and will help him "phone home."<p>Audiences the world over were won over by this simple yet touching film, and by the end of its theatrical run it had become the biggest box office hit of its time, surpassing Star Wars, the previous top-grosser.  With its mix of comedy, suspense, and Walt Disney-like fantasy, E.T. received both popular and critical acclaim, including several Academy Award nominations, including Best Score for John Williams' wonderful music, Best Original Screenplay, Best Director, and Best Picture.  Although E.T. won the best score and original screenplay awards, Sir Richard Attenborough's drama about India's most famous leader beat out Spielberg and E.T. in the latter categories.<p>Last year, Amblin Entertainment and MCA/Universal released a 20th Anniversary Edition of E.T. in theaters. With its soundtrack digitally remastered and some scenes tweaked with computer graphic imaging, a new generation of viewers saw this family classic on the big screen.  And in November of 2002, E.T. finally was released on the DVD format.<p>The DVD 2-disc set includes both versions of the film, a rare event for DVD releases.  Universal had originally planned to release the 2002 version separately and to sell the 1982 version in a more expensive boxed set.  Spielberg heard of this and vetoed the plan, thereby allowing everyone to own both versions of his most personal film at a reasonable price.<p>This is a must-get DVD for Spielberg fans...and for children of all ages.</p></br><a href="../users/A25AXWGBGJ5KBS.html">A25AXWGBGJ5KBS</a><br/><p>The new spiffed-up version of E.T. is like a coat of wax on a classic automobile. It just makes what's already there look a little nicer.<br />OK...'way nicer. This DVD looks crisp and fresh, with bright colors and gobs of detail.<br />E.T. was the pre-eminent filmgoing event for a generation, the group after &quot;Star Wars&quot;.<br />And with good reason. It's a perfect film.  It hasn't aged a bit. Or I should say it's aging ridiculously well. Or is it &quot;ageless&quot;?  Whatever. You get the point.<br />In fifty years, this film will be as beloved as &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;...or as any Disney flick...<br />Henry Thomas puts on a performance that ranks with ANY ever delivered by a child actor, and it is his believability that make ET real to US. I find myself getting all choked up over this rubber blobby thing with a red flashlight in it's chest, and it's all Mr. Thomas' fault.<br />Mr. Spielberg probably has a little to do with it as well.<br />Drew Barrymore has phenomenal comedic timing in this movie, whether that's through the magic of editing or coaching or what. But after nearly every line of hers, I busted out laughing.<br />No matter how many times I see this movie...last night being the first time in a few years...it still &quot;gets&quot; me.

Is it a classic? Yes although it's far from the most perfect Spielberg film. Clearly Spielberg has taken a page out of the Lucas playbook--when in doubt fix what really doesn't need fixing.<p>First the positives--the new opticals look terrific and the new sequences with E.T. do give him more mobility. The 20th anniversary edition includes all the new sequences. The new sequences are cute but don't really add a lot to the original film. <p>The &quot;original&quot; unretouched version of the film is included on disc two. Despite it's flaws, it's superior to the 20th anniversary re-release. Like Star Wars, what was added didn't amount to much and didn't improve the film. That's evident when you compare the two back to back. <p>The extras are nice. A look into the evolution of E.T. from conception to execution and comments from Spielberg in an introduction. Sadly, no audio commentary was done for the film. In a way that's good--most film directors explain too much and take away some of the magic.<p>The packaging is flimsy and, while well designed, E.T. should have been issued in a clamshell case. Clamshell cases tend to handle wear and tear better than cardboard packaging.</p></br><a href="../users/A35WVFSULRE1G9.html">A35WVFSULRE1G9</a><br/><p>A very intimate, touching, and believable film about a boy that connects with an Alien deeper then we can imagine.

Forget about that stuff, indulge in the story, and the ending is fantastic, a definate tearjearker. And remember people, it is a film and fantasy, look at Spielbergs intent, that what roams in outerspace is not always scary and violent, but have feelings like us. WOW, THAT IS NEW.

A box office sensation, E.T. formed long, around-the-corner lines of fans waiting to get into theaters and propelled child star Drew Barrymore to superstar status. One of director Steven Spielberg's greatest triumphs, E.T. supposedly symbolizes and illustrates feelings of loneliness from the Hollywood icon's youth which resulted from his parents' divorce. A touching story about spirits from differing worlds, E.T. is fun for the entire family. With an original soundtrack (composed by John Williams and winner of an Academy Award), E.T. is a film that thrills its viewers by every means at its disposal...<br /><br />While visiting Earth late one evening, a spacecraft carrying a group of alien botanist researchers is startled by the approach an elite government task force. Disappearing in a flash, one of the aliens is left behind. As the task force searches the forest for signs of the creature, he appears inside a young boy's tool shed in search of food (such as Reese's Pieces - a product spot way ahead of its time). Discovered by ten-year-old Elliot (Henry Thomas), the extra-terrestrial is nicknamed E.T. and befriends Elliot, his older brother Michael, and his younger sister Gertie (Drew Barrymore) - all of whom are suffering as a result of their parents' impending divorce...<br /><br />Hiding E.T. in his room, Elliot successfully manages to hide the secret from his mother, while E.T. slowly learns the customs and ways of the earthling. Building a communication device that will allow him to "phone home" for help, E.T. begins to run short on time when he catches a deadly disease and his hiding place is discovered by the government task force, which cares only about its ability to study him and not about his life. With Elliot's health now intimately connected to E.T., he begins to suffer as well. Can Elliot and his friends come to E.T.'s aid? Will E.T. escape the clutches of his government captors and return home a healthy, smiling alien? The journey to find out is simply magical...<br /><br />A true blockbuster and a pop culture phenomenon in its time, E.T. continues to bring joy and inspiration to each new generation of children who see it. Like Spielberg's film The Goonies and the contemporary Harry Potter films, E.T. creates movie magic by unleashing a world of endless imagination where children are the true heroes. In doing so, it unlocks a whole new world of fantasy for the children who watch it...<br /><br />Easily one of the best 100 films of all time, E.T. is a cinematic masterpiece by any standard of measurement. Spielberg deserves all the praise and accolades he received both then and now. With its widespread, universal appeal and ingenious combination of cinematography and Williams' inspired musical score, E.T. is a definite must-see film...

Just the movies unless otherwise stated.<br /><br />Please note that the rating above might not accurately reflect my thoughts, you will see a rating sentence at the end of the review.<br /><br />What an awesome movie. Steven Spielberg and John Williams of course are the big names, but everyone played a fantastic part in this film. But lemme say, John Williams has been with Steven Spielberg most of the way through. I'll just name a few, Jaws, Indiana Jones, E.T., Jurassic Park, and Spielberg was offered to do Superman and didn't take it. But John took the job, I guess it just felt right. Now, more onto E.T. I like how they gradually revel E.T., just enough for your soul to feel just right. I mean, Steven really knows how to play with your sole, and that makes him one of the best filmmakers in all the times.<br /><br />Speaking of which, the Cinematography in this film is fantastic. The shots are just incredible! You don't get those natural panoramic views today. Just 360 shots. Blaugh. The humor in E.T. is great and light hearted, just pure. No $3Xual jokes or violence needed for the laughing, just light hearted humor everyone can get around. I find that in Spielberg movies, and Ghostbusters. The special effects are just completely amazing, HOW DID THEY DO THAT IN 1982??? I didn't think they used CGI in live action at the time. Yet, they also capture your imagination. I know I sound paid off (oh, hello Spielberg...) No, I'm just joking around. The animals are a good addition but I feel as if they were mistreated.<br /><br />Cliches do exist, however, they fit in nicely in the film. Another feature similar to Indiana Jones. But here, it's family cliche, where in Indy it's action cliche. Jurassic Park has Sci-Fi cliche, Jaws has horror cliche, gosh, Spielberg likes cliches. E.T. also has a great personality, you can totally get around this guy. He's just perfect for the role, he's so awesome. And speaking of which, I love how gradually he is able to learn both together with friends and on his own. It just shows they didn't sham a family movie, and really put some personality in this character. The child actors are fantastic, this beats Goonies. I have never seen children act with such character and feelings. It just shows what. They are free and well spirited.<br /><br />There is a fake kids show in the film that helps E.T. talk, but the text on it is disturbing. Oh well, minor quibble. Minor complement, I also love E.T.'s voice, it's just so classic. You know, I've waited WAY too long to see this amazing film. The characters are wonderful, they all represent a different part of society. The inexperienced, intermediate, experienced but naive, elder, corrupt, pure, and of course, foreign. It just fits perfectly into such a wonderful film. Just a perfectly pure and clever film. Better than some of the junk put out these days. Oh and, of course, the Halloween scene has to be talked about. No way could anybody ever make a costume so simple yet so clever. Meaning, all you haft to do is put a sheet over your head to dress up like E.T. Pure genius.<br /><br />Honestly, I feel the bike scene might be overrated. But, I waited to long to see this film, maybe my brain has been to synthesized. That's something I gotta live with. I also have seen but no memory of Spider-Man. But, that's nothing like waiting to see E.T. The psychological aspect of this film is original and genius, the ability to feel other feelings. That's AMAZING! No thinking other thoughts, Spielberg was able to THINK in the way I am. Feel other feelings, that's correct and amazing. Beautiful. This movie isn't afraid to rip your heart out, or put your heart back in. It makes you feel extremely deeply.<br /><br />"Hey, who are you?" "I'm driving." Awesome line, that goes in the line of fame. Such a beautiful film.<br /><br />I rate it, 5.3/5</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>E.T. is one of the best family movies I've ever seen that ALSO has a bit of a scary horror vibe.  You know, when aliens supposedly make a crash landing in a farmers barn in the middle of the night, and the farmer hears this and runs outside slowly with a shotgun ready to unload.  That sort of happens here, except, instead of an insane farmer, it's a little boy with an older brother and younger sister.<br /><br />I liked how the kids kept the alien hidden from their mother.  There were some close calls though, where the mother was only one step away from finding out about the alien, but for most of the movie, E.T. was kept hidden by the kids.<br /><br />The movie has good acting and really holds up well as far as family storylines go.  Also the film doesn't look old for 1982 either- the picture quality is surprisingly pretty good.<br /><br />One thing I think people forget to mention about E.T. is how well done the storyline is- it actually involves people feeling emotion towards aliens and open-minded about outerspace, and the alien slowly develops the same kind of feelings for humans.  Very nice touch.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YB29BIDULEYE.html">A1YB29BIDULEYE</a><br/><p>This is not an essential Halloween movie, but it is really great. It's a science fiction movie that shows us aspects of the human condition.<br /><br />Elliot (12 or so) is basically an outsider. His older brother and friends are not exactly cruel to him, but they do make him feel like they are doing him a favor by allowing him to participate in their activities. Later, Elliot runs into E.T. Basically, because Elliot is an outsider, he is more receptive to accepting someone else who is an outsider.<br /><br />To make a long story short, Elliot gradually convinces his older brother (Mike) and his younger sister (Gertie) to help get E.T. home. (He was accidentally left behind by his friends.) It is interesting how in their compassion for E.T., the civil disputes between Elliot, Michael, and Gertie seem to disappear.<br /><br />If we want to get really technical, there is a moment in the classroom where we see that Elliot and E.T. have a link. And in science class, Elliot frees all the frogs that were going to be cut up for study. (Later, we will see that this has relevance to the climax.)<br /><br />Moving on, there is the Halloween moment of the show. E.T. hopes to call his people to get him home, and Halloween is the one night where he could easily be mistaken for just a kid trick or treating. But this is when trouble starts.<br /><br />There are other people who are interested in E.T. for possibly less than kind reasons. But this leads to a climactic and comical chase to get E.T. home.<br /><br />Overall it's a great movie science fiction movie that shows us about the acceptance of outsiders.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: I'm one of the few people who felt that the Atari 2600 game "E.T." really wasn't so bad.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PV6GK1HV54Y9.html">A2PV6GK1HV54Y9</a><br/><p>E.T. is a childhood favorite but I have to admit, E.T. scared me a bit. That little alien was kinda freaky to look at, but watching it now he's so cute and precious, what was I so afraid of? Henry Thomas should've been a bigger star after this movie, such a talented actor. Drew Barrymore is pure genius in this, she steals every scene. This film isn't perfect but this movie came out the year I was born so it has special meaning for me, enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A2D7NX9ZYBJZ13.html">A2D7NX9ZYBJZ13</a><br/><p>heh we grew Up watchin this Great Movie E.T ,I own this Ultimate Editionand 'tis one of my Favorite movies ever, you won't regret it too :)</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>When it comes down to everyone's favorite film, there's always a feeling that you tend to look towards cinema classic; films that are so universally acclaimed it seems automatic someone would just inherently call it the best movie ever even if you've never seen it or it just makes other movies lesser in comparison. However, a film like E.T is one of those kind where I can honestly say it's one of my favorite films even if it doesn't have the cinematic contributions of Citizen Kane, the epic splendor of Lawrence of Arabia or the sheer excitement of Star Wars. Instead you get a very touching family film that will appeal to everyone, unless you're some jaded person.<br /><br />Elliot (Henry Thomas) is a lonely kid with not a whole lot of friends, a split up family and is quite alienated. But near to his house, an alien being is left behind, stranding him on Earth. Elliot discovers him and with the help of Reeses' Pieces, adopts him into his family (sans mother's knowledge of course), names him "E.T" and has brother Michael and sister Gertie helping out. But there's others interested in E.T.'s presence on Earth and Elliot somehow has to get E.T back home even he wants him to stay.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg has always been accused of putting sentimentality where it's not needed, as if he's too afraid the film will be too dark so he has to put something that ties everything up. E.T. though manages to be touching without schmaltzy or pandering. In fact, the film can even be heartwarming in several scenes. One of my favorites is after Gertie first sees E.T and runs away, with E.T, arms up in the air, going after her like a crazed movie monster. Sure it's silly but I got to admit, I chuckled. I always like how it was shot: mainly from a kid's point of view so, besides Elliot's mom, every adult's top half is never seen or their face is obscured. The film is almost like a modern fairy tale and so while we can forgive E.T.'s ability to contact his people with a Speak and Spell while NASA can't do it with a 50 foot dish, it's still for kids and you almost don't even notice it anyway.<br /><br />Now I for one at least understand Spielberg's decision to do a bit of a redo of E.T's visuals, namely the character himself. Now he's more expressive and using more muscle features and movement but he looks, ironically, clunky. There's 2 noticeable problems right in the first scene alone: E.T hops rabbit-like instead of running in a straight line (a light on a track but still) which makes it almost more comical, then we have him running to a hill out of breath whereas in the original cut, he gazed solemnly and in one spot as his family takes off. Later on, his animation looks too noticeable against the more grainy/faded colors of the 1982 print, making him look more sharper than everything around him. But unlike long-time friend George Lucas who basically released the original Star Wars trilogy untouched because fans were mad the special editions were the only DVD version available, Spielberg at least knows some might prefer the old cut and some might want to watch the new one.<br /><br />For those of you getting mad that Spielberg ruined E.T, keep in mind the original is still on this set and the Limited Edition 2 disc one so while some don't like the new changes, it's not like we can't have the old E.T. back and since it's such a great movie in its own right, that's a great thing to have.</p></br><a href="../users/A2198FZZMTJ38H.html">A2198FZZMTJ38H</a><br/><p>Having made quite an impact on audiences from the time of its theatrical release to the present day, Steven Speilberg's &quot;E.T. The Extra Terrestrial&quot; is one of the great movies of all time, a classic that lives up to the hype and popularity it has attained over the last two decades. Here is a movie that has proved itself as a true success, a standout film that still has not lost its ability to dazzle the young and old with its touching story and likeable characters. <p>I remember years ago to my childhood, when Thanksgiving was just not Thanksgiving without watching the movie play on television each year, to be replaced later with modern, though less enjoyable, holiday films. As a child, the movie filled me with a sense of awe and wonderment, tickling my funny bone while at the same time evoking dread and suspense as it draws near to its spectacular and unforgettable conclusion. Watching the movie today allows me to look back at this experience and realize that the movie still carries the same emotional strings for me. <p>The story of a young boy named Elliot who befriends a space alien left behind on Earth embodies great spirit, carrying with it the lessons of friendship, devotion, and love. Elliot, who names his new friend E.T., begins teaching the arrival the ways of humankind, sharing the secret with his siblings, who are equally entranced by the terrestrial. <p>These are some of the warmest moments in movie history, burning themselves into our hearts forever. The child in all of us easily finds a soft spot for the short-statured creature, who waddles along in a manner that steals the heart. One cannot help but instantly fall in love with E.T., whose thirst for knowledge is evident in his wide, endearing eyes. His innocence, and the warm nature of his friendship with Elliot, make the movie's final act a tour de force of emotion, from suspense of tears, sadness to joy. We will always remember the bicycle ride, a stunning display of special effects that actually have heart and soul to them, and an ending that is warm and meaningful.<p>Just as the creature earns a place in history, so do the human characters, acted under some very effective performances. Henry Thomas possesses terrific talent, and his performance as Elliot remains emotionally sweeping even by today's standards. Dee Wallace Stone is great as Elliot's mother, while Robert MacNaughton and a young Drew Barrymore are wonderful as his siblings. <p>&quot;E.T.&quot; has earned itself a place in movie history, and deserves its praise and more. The film is a composition of sheer brilliance, a feast for the eyes and the heart that is captivating and enthralling. Watching it as a child proves to be the best experience, though those who watch it later in years may be tempted to recall their first experience with the film, which has an endearing nature that outshines most other films.</p></br><a href="../users/A35XFZN4MWNKK4.html">A35XFZN4MWNKK4</a><br/><p>Steven Speilberg takes the utterley commonplace story of a lonley child befriending an alien from outer space. Despite the theme being somewhat  tried and tested several times before this does emerge as a unique and  absolutley fantastic fantasy movie with still very stunning visual effects  and wonderful performances. Alongside, THE WIZARD OF OZ, this possibly has  to be the greatest child fantasy film of all time!  Its blend of humour  and sometimes highly emotional scenes add to the greatness of this film and  the ending is sure to get a lump in even adults throats. An excellent  classic!</p></br><a href="../users/A13OMT8D4GPIBV.html">A13OMT8D4GPIBV</a><br/><p>This is a fantastic film.

It works on so many levels and Henry Thomas gives a wonderful performance.<br /><br />But the first disc ruins the classic.  CGI takes away that realistic feel to movies.  No matter how wondeful the advancements are, there's something about CGI that ruins a classic when it's retouched in an unneeded way.<br /><br />E.T. did not need retouching.  It's a perfect film.

Everyone in the family will always enjoy it. Now with that being said, I, like most people, have issues with this new edition of E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial. First off, the new CGI look for the alien himself is just plain silly. He looks way more unrealistic that he does in the original version. He looks too much like Jar-Jar Binks and Dobby (from Harry Potter). And then, there are the "edits" that have been made. You probably know what's wrong here: replacing weapons with talkie-talkies, replacing the word "terrorist" with "hippie," editing out the word "[...]," etc. Why couldn't they just leave this film alone and leave it the way it is? The great original is the one that should be watched, not the new 2002 version where it is dominated by political correctness. The 2-Disc Limited Collector's Edition is no longer in stock, so you'll have to find used DVD's. Why? Because it's the only edition that has the original 1982 version. So find one here, or on Ebay, or wherever you can find it, and skip the new 2002 version.<br /><br />E.T. 1982: A<br />E.T. 2002: F</p></br><a href="../users/A2JDYUSI2RILEB.html">A2JDYUSI2RILEB</a><br/><p>The old clich&eacute; that you cannot go home again happily doesn't apply to Steven Spielberg's E.T., the 1982 classic that hits Blu-Ray for the first time on October 9th. Right off the bat I can say that the film's HD transfer is beautiful, boasting clear detail, no overt use of DNR, and no color scheme "retweaking" that I could detect.<br /><br />The last time I had seen the film theatrically was in 2002 for its 20th Anniversary re-release -- the ninth time I had seen the movie in theaters, but the first viewing I had on the big screen since E.T. first opened in 1982. At that point, I was not quite eight years old, and my lifelong love for the movies was about to take hold during that magical summer of genre favorites.<br /><br />Watching the film again, as an adult, in 2002 was fascinating - not just because of how well the movie holds up, but in how it captivates children as well as adults, who can watch the film from a different perspective and yet be every bit as moved and spellbound by the story as kids are. I was finally able to see what critics had described in 1982, about how Speilberg's movie works for grown-ups in profound yet subtle ways. Whereas kids primarily identify with Elliott's plight to help E.T. get home, on this viewing I carefully studied the reaction of the other characters in the film, and was in awe of how Spielberg carefully painted every character's nuance in seemingly small background detail so effectively. Specifically, I was moved by how Elliott's older brother (an underrated performance by Robert McNaughton) aids his younger brother and gains his uncompromising trust, and how Peter Coyote's initially-villainous, ultimately sympathetic "Man With The Keys" is essentially Elliott as a grown-up, understanding his emotions and wanting to help the abandoned alien but not knowing how.<br /><br />The movie is told with beautiful economy -- each scene creates and sustains an emotion integral to the characters, or serves to propel the story forward. The sequences with Elliott showing E.T. his room, his Star Wars figures, are so genuine, feel so real, that you forget you are watching a sci-fi fantasy that tugs on your heartstrings. It's the kind of movie that cynics love to bash because it makes them feel emotional, but E.T.'s cinematic virtues are plentiful. The movie is anything but saccharine emotion. It makes you care about Elliott and his family because Spielberg and writer Melissa Mathison make them seem like real people. There aren't any moments early in the film that don't feel like real life, and this timeless quality makes one get past the occasional '80s staple like an Atari 2600 camping out on the top of the family TV.<br /><br />We all know and love the film's operatic ending, but there are scenes throughout E.T. that are subtle and yet every bit as sublime. This is illustrated perfectly in the sequence in which E.T. watches the mother (Dee Wallace) read "Peter Pan" to Gertie (Drew Barrymore), with the creature almost as interested in studying their interaction as he is in Elliott's plan to help him return to the mothership. Henry Thomas' performance is still the greatest juvenile performance I've ever seen, and the sequence in which Elliott says goodbye to E.T. -- whom he believes to be dead -- is as moving as any moment in the entire film.<br /><br />Making all of it work, of course, is John Williams' music, still arguably his finest score for not only its outstanding lyricism, but its unforgettable, symbiotic relationship with the movie itself. From the quiet, poignant cues underscoring Elliott and E.T.'s scenes together - to the glorious finale that says every word in musical terms that Spielberg happily didn't feel the need to spell out with dialogue - Williams' music is E.T. It's another character in the film, punctuating every emotion in a fashion that's as restrained at times as it is powerful at others.<br /><br />It's a marvelous, wonderful film and its Blu-Ray release, coming up early next month, adds to its legacy.<br /><br />Universal's 1080p AVC encoded transfer of E.T. (in its 1982 original release version) is crisply detailed without any obvious noise or DNR filtering; overall, the presentation is sterling, enhancing Allen Daviau's cinematography in a transfer that does justice to the film's '82 theatrical cut. The DTS MA audio is effectively rendered as well, boasting a broad stage for Williams' masterful score.<br /><br />For extra features, the disc adds one new interview with Spielberg and more of John Toll's behind the scenes footage, as well as recycles other extras from the 2002 DVD releases. This unfortunately means that, once again, Laurent Bouzereau's unedited 1990s laserdisc documentary hasn't been included (just a cut-down version is on hand), and it's a strange, notable omission since it contained the only full release of Harrison Ford's deleted appearance as Elliott's school principal - as well as the film's excised ending coda. That those particular scenes have never been screened again outside of that documentary sadly remains a mystery (just a few shots of the Ford scene are included in the "Evolution & Creation of E.T." documentary, with Spielberg talking over them).<br /><br />Here's a specific breakdown of what is included:<br /><br />-Steven Spielberg & E.T. (12 mins., HD): A new conversation with Spielberg on the production of the film, its genesis, the essential component of Melissa Mathison's involvement, and a nice anecdote involving his screening of the film to President Reagan at the White House.<br /><br />-The E.T. Journals (53 mins., SD): This release's other noteworthy new extra is a longer assembly of behind the scenes footage from the production of the picture, much of it shot by future "Braveheart" Oscar winner John Toll. Some of this was included (in various forms) on prior releases, but there's more of it here, presented uncut and without new "talking head" commentary, thanks to Laurent Bouzereau.<br /><br />-Deleted scenes (3 mins., HD): Two deleted scenes, added to the 20th Anniversary re-release, are presented here in HD. Neither is essential to the film and the CGI does seem out of place given the rest of the picture (though it's subdued and well executed), but the brief Halloween bit sets the scene nicely. None of the digitally "reworked" scenes involving the government agents' guns are included - although Spielberg said 10 years ago he wanted the guns removed, apparently he's had a change of heart and prefers to let his original version speak for itself.<br /><br />-A Look Back (37 mins., SD): Retrospective doc compiled for the 2002 home video release, which is essentially a cut-down version of Laurent Bouzereau's '90s laserdisc documentary (which ran more than twice as long).<br /><br />-The Evolution and Creation of E.T. (50 mins., SD): Previously available in the three-disc, more expensive 2002 DVD box-set release, this recounts the production in a lengthier manner than "A Look Back."<br /><br />-The E.T. Reunion (17 mins., SD): The cast reunites with Spielberg in this 17-minute piece from the 2002 DVD package.<br /><br />-The Music of E.T.: A Conversation with John Williams (10 mins., SD): Williams interview from the 2002, three-disc DVD box-set.<br /><br />-The 20th Anniversary Premiere (18 mins., SD): Another previously-released featurette showing John Williams conducting the L.A. Philharmonic at the Shrine Auditorium for the movie's special 20th Anniversary screening. (Note the prior DVD had an isolated audio track of this performance that ran during the film, which is not included here).<br /><br />-Designs, Photographs and Marketing: A series of previously released still galleries<br /><br />-Trailer (SD): The full 2-minute theatrical trailer (offering some unused footage of E.T.'s ship landing) in non-anamorphic standard def.<br /><br />-Special Olympics/McDonalds TV spot</p></br><a href="../users/A1U6B2LDK3BUVU.html">A1U6B2LDK3BUVU</a><br/><p>I just want to go on record as saying this is a great movie.  I've been watching a lot of the most famous movies of all time, and few of them hold up like this does.  It is one of the few that merits a five star rating.<br /><br />Elliott, and Drew Barrymore, put on great performances as children.  I can't remember when I've seen such good acting from little kids.<br /><br />It's a very emotional and warm and fuzzy film.</p></br><a href="../users/A20LY8E9NGYA4M.html">A20LY8E9NGYA4M</a><br/><p>In 2002, Steven Spielberg decided to release an updated version of his 1982 classic "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial". Universal announced that this update included new footage and new digital effects. Some people complain about the new special effects and the added scenes, but to be honest, it's not a big change, it's just some makeup that doesn't change the heart and soul of the movie: the story and the characters.<br /><br />This movie features our favorite alien, a little squashy guy known as E.T., he gets involved in a very special relationship with a little boy when he is left alone in the Earth. And that friendship is one of the strongest things about "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial". Steven Spielberg created a great dynamic with the cast (specially the children), it's easy to see the wide display of emotions that these young actors printed on the movie. The adults are very good, but the young actors stole the show on this film.<br /><br />"E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial" has some of the most heartwarming scenes in movie history, a lot of people was touched with the brief death of E.T., or the return of the little alien to his home, or the magical scene when Elliott and E.T. cross the sky at night in a bicycle with the moon as background. This movie is the best thing that most of the cast was involved in. Henry Thomas (Elliott) and Robert MacNaughton (Michael) never were involved in a project of this size. Only Drew Barrymore remains very popular today, but most of the people will forever see her as the cute Gertie.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg solidified an already strong reputation as a remarkable filmmaker with "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial", and John Williams (his favorite composer) created more incredible songs for the score of the movie. Spielberg filmed movies of greater scale, but "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial" remains as his more emotional movie. The DVD features great stuff that the fans of this movie will love, so if you like "E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial", then the DVD is a must-buy</p></br><a href="../users/A31RM5QU797HPJ.html">A31RM5QU797HPJ</a><br/><p>E.T., an alien, gets stuck on Earth and wants to go back home.

The best part of the package are the extras, including a 'Making-of' documentary, outtakes from the original film (did you know Harrison Ford originally had a cameo?), a concert version of the theme, performed by John Williams and orchestra, interviews with the artists who created the creature, and, best of all, a reunion of the original leads (they all look WONDERFUL!), with Spielberg. (No, B-movie star C. Thomas Howell, and Playmate/Actress Erika Eleniak, both of whom were in the original, are included in the reunion!)<p>The only disappointment in the Special Edition is that they DON'T address what has become the great unanswered controversy of E.T. ...who actually provided the voice of the creature?

Steven Spielberg, like Hitchcock, DeMille, and John Ford before him, is no stranger to making masterpieces, and this is unquestionably one of them.<p>Its story of a young boy named Elliott(Henry Thomas) who befriends a very benign alien accidentally left stranded on Earth and takes it upon himself to protect the alien from government agents is so well known that there is really no need to go into extensive detail anymore.  But sprinkled throughout this masterpiece are individual moments that stand out among the greatest single moments ever put on film (the bicycle ride across the moon, the Elliott/E.T. emotional connection).  One scene that has always stood out for me personally is the first meeting between Elliott's kid sister Gertie (Drew Barrymore) and E.T., in which Gertie screams her head off.  It is one of the very few times where I've wanted to laugh and scream in the same breath.<p>Winner of five Oscars, including John Williams' legendary music score, E.T. has grossed over $1 billion, and it's not surprising to see why.  This is most assuredly a story that touched the world, as its advertising says, and it continues to be highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I bought the E.T.

We could go back and forth all day talking about this, but in short....let things stay intact! No altering films or art etc., whether its a classic or not! It is what it is! OK?????? Ahhhh I feel slightly better now! The original film E.T is a wonderful film that seemed even better than I remembered. The DVD transfer looks great and the audio was really surprisingly good! The is an excellent film, but look for the gift set cheap. AVOID THE SINGLE DISC LIKE THE PLAGUE!</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASIT0JYIGHTA.html">A2ASIT0JYIGHTA</a><br/><p>The USA 2-disc edition of E.T is now the only available DVD anywhere in the world. Universal discontinued the UK and Australian DVD releases some time ago to reflect the limited edition, and while this was to be the case in America too, it is obvious that it is still available there.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the USA edition was always the only one worth buying because it included the 1982 release. The Australian and UK releases are PAL formatted which doesn't allow as much disc space as NTSC. Distributors in these regions therefore decided that consumers would prefer the full length special features over inclusion of the 1982 version. A pity because the 1982 version is much better, and how most of us remember it. I think Universal short-changed it's international clients.<br /><br />Many reviewers have slammed the 2002 version because of the CGI tampering of E.T's character. I have to agree with them, the CGI has caused E.T to look too comical in scenes and quite unrealistic. I can't comprehend how Spielberg considers these alterations an improvement and more aligned to his vision. However, if you own the USA DVD, it doesn't matter because you can simply choose the better 1982 version. In my opinion, movies shouldn't be enhanced unless it is to improve their picture quality (ie. to remove grain, dust etc).<br /><br />Overall, a movie worth owning (providing you have the USA DVD).</p></br><a href="../users/A3U56M0Y8LYO6J.html">A3U56M0Y8LYO6J</a><br/><p>Positive films are rare commodities indeed.  Angst, disillusion, and loss are such common themes in cinema that it makes one wonder if film is indeed an escapist refuge from the real world or just a mirror of our own sobering existence.  Films that accentuate all that is good in life have been in short supply since the medium first gained widespread commercial appeal.  Only once in a while does a film like "The Wizard of Oz," "It's A Wonderful Life" or "The Sound of Music" come our way to make us feel good about ourselves.  Steven Spielberg's &quot;E.T The Extra-Terrestrial&quot; is another such film. <p>A spaceship lands one night and its alien inhabitants disembark in search of plant samples.  When the ship leaves to avoid detection, one of its crew is left behind in the forest.  This lost creature finds refuge at the home of a boy named Elliott (Henry Thomas) and the two of them forge a strong friendship.  When the government tries to seize the alien, Elliott and his supporters foil their plans and escape with the little visitor so that it can rendezvous with its spaceship and return home.  <p>The most fascinating aspect of &quot;E.T The Extra-Terrestrial&quot; is how lifelike the alien is.  So convincing are the special effects that we have no trouble accepting the strange little creature as a living being.  The manner in which it interacts with its surroundings and with its supporting human performers is the definition of cinematic magic.  Thomas also deserves his fair share of credit for the film's success.  It is difficult enough to deliver a strong child performance but to do so while acting opposite a mass of puppets and animatronics is especially noteworthy.  &quot;E.T The Extra-Terrestrial&quot; is one of those films that celebrates the joy and adventure of childhood.  It is a suburban fairy-tale that will enthrall and delight youngster for generations to come.  It is also a reminder of the tremendous contribution Steven Spielberg has made to American culture in his lifetime.</p></br><a href="../users/A3V6Z4RCDGRC44.html">A3V6Z4RCDGRC44</a><br/><p>I know many adults who, when pressed, will admit to crying during ET. It's a movie that really knows how to play your heart-strings. The basic story is pretty straight-forward. A cute, friendly alien gets stranded on earth, and is befriended by a young boy and girl who try to help the alien get back home again. In an era where most aliens are evil, nasty creatures bent on world domination, the police and FBI agents are all out to grab and investigate this menace. So you end up with the nasty, dark government against the cute, innocent kids.<br /><br />I saw this movie as a teen and enjoyed it greatly. I've seen the movie *with* kids and they loved it. It really is a movie that appeals to all ages, and it does that without talking down to anyone. It's earned its spot in the AFI top 100 movie listing with its plot, pacing, acting and directing.<br /><br />If I have a complaint here, it's with the "redone" 2002 version. The movie was great as it was when first put out. There was no need to alter the ET main character. His whole appeal was that he was organic and someone you could relate to. Why turn him into a CGI thing?<br /><br />Also, I have an issue with them turning the police and FBI's weapons into walkie-talkies. Sure, kids don't need to be exposed to Pulp Fiction degrees of blood and violence. However, to say that police officers can't carry weapons makes no sense to me. What's next - gunfighters in the old west who walk around with empty holsters? When real police do community policing and walk beats, should they hide their guns so that kids don't see them? I found this completely unnecessary and more than a little insulting to the intelligence of the youngsters watching with me.<br /><br />Watch the original movie, which is what the AFI voted in - not the "PC version".</p></br><a href="../users/A3BJDFGSLXFB36.html">A3BJDFGSLXFB36</a><br/><p>I recently watched E.T. for the first time in many years with my 4 year old daughter. It was like I was watching it again for the very first time. She absolutely loves this film and so do I.<br /><br />I was 11 when this movie came out, so I really could relate with the kids in the film. I grew up in that same generation, in middle-class suburbia, USA, had Star Wars toys, rode bikes with my friends, etc. Watching this film brought it all back to me again and reminded me of a time in my life when the world was much bigger and life was a lot simpler. It's amazing how age can take the innocence away from you, but this movie is the perfect way to get it back, even if just for 2 hours.<br /><br />Even though I had seen the movie and knew what was going to happen, I still cried like a baby when E.T. "died" and when he finally went home. The scene at the very end when the spaceship leaves a rainbow in its wake and you see the reactions of the kids and the adults as the ship disappears will make your heart burst and leave you weeping like a child.<br /><br />Most of the naysayers of this film are definitely in the minority. This film is sheer brilliance and Spielberg has forged himself a place in history by directing it. The story, the acting, the music, the cinematography are all perfectly executed. It is a film that can be enjoyed by all ages.<br /><br />One pet peeve, though. The 2002 version is a sell-out. The digital "upgrading" of some of the effects were well-done and appreciated, but replacing guns with walkie-talkies is just plain stupid. While I was watcing the 2002 version, I thought to myself, "That's a strange way to hold a walkie-talkie." Then I realized that in the original version, it was a gun, not a radio.<br /><br />I was very disappointed that Spielberg would feel pressured to alter this work of genius just because of political correctness. Police and government agents carry guns. They sometimes even use them to hurt or kill others. It's a fact of life. If that fact was too much for kids to handle, why didn't Spielberg edit out the whole part where E.T. dies? That's a cold, hard fact of life as well. If you're gonna go PC, why not go all the way? Why? Because doing so would have totally eradicated the emotional impact of the film and it would never have become such a huge hit. What can I say? Money talks; another cold, hard fact of life.<br /><br />Enough ranting. Please, purchase this DVD. Not only is it a masterful work of movie-making, not only is it a piece of cinema history, you will actually ENJOY it! It's one of those movies you can actually enjoy with the whole family.<br /><br />Priceless, timeless, ageless, E.T. has suspense, action, humor, and most importantly, a message of love and friendship that transcends all boundaries. What else do you need from a film?</p></br><a href="../users/ABX7SEE84DMLU.html">ABX7SEE84DMLU</a><br/><p>The spotlight reviews here make a good point:  does the owner of a artistic property have the right to revise it to make it better, if we do not agree that the revisions improve the original?  We see it here, we see it with "Star Wars," and we see it elsewhere.<br /><br />This release confronts that point head on.  Once a creative work is relased and viewed, who owns it?<br /><br />Our reviewers above would say that the viewers own it, and the creator is barred from tinkering with it.<br /><br />I disagree.  Here are my points:<br /><br />1.  Viewers asserting ownership are always free to keep their copies of the original, intact, and watch them as often as they like.<br /><br />2.  "Fair warning."  The DVD box bills this as "an all-new version."  It's not like Speilberg didn't tell us what he was doing.<br /><br />3.  True to the austeur's purposes.  He wants to pitch this new version to a young audience, and has peeled off the things that would distract the little ones.<br /><br />Whether you agree with these changes or not, weren't you thrilled with all the special features here?  It was one of the best DVD packages in its time (2002), particularly getting to see John Williams conduct one of the most memorable scores he ever created.<br /><br />Just buy them both, and then relax...</p></br><a href="../users/ASHT96DUVMF1S.html">ASHT96DUVMF1S</a><br/><p>E.T. is a favorite from my childhood along with movies like Goonies, Explorers and Monster Squad. This Limited Edition Collection is a must for Collectors.  They will stop producing it after the new year. An almost flawless transfer gives a bright picture and great colors.  Their is a lot of special features along with the Live performance of John Williams conducting at the 2002 premiere.  I liked the 1982 version better without the new computer animation of ET.  Overall this is one of the better DVD's to come out in the last several months.</p></br><a href="../users/APM06HT7JIPZ5.html">APM06HT7JIPZ5</a><br/><p>I had not seen this film for atleast 3 years, and felt like seeing it again.  When I heard that the title would be discontinued on Dec. 31, I rushed out and got it.  WELL WORTH MY MONEY!!!<p>Having never gotten around to seeing it in theaters, I waited to see the new restored edition with great anticipation.  Well, Steven Spielberg made the right choices with this one!!  What he adds to the film only further perfects what was an already perfect movie.  The enhanced special effects make E.T. look twice as good/realistic, and adds much more flexibility and muscles to his face.  We also see, in the beginning of the film, how exactly E.T. moves so darn fast!  The newly-inserted "bathroom" scene was probably the best addition to the movie; it adds more time for E.T. and Elliot to get to know eachother (and also gives a hint that E.T.'s species is slightly aquatic).  It's a very funny scene!  And the restored soundtrack by John Williams is magnificent, and is great with surround sound!<p>The special features, while not necessarily great, are good enough, and are worth at least one viewing.  The "making-of" documentary is the best of the selections, and is very interesting.  "The Reunion" was a major disappointment, as I was expecting the hour-long special I saw on TV, which was very insightful and funny.  The new one featured here is a mere ten minutes.<p>Oh well.  Even if the special features are nothing to get excited about, the true gem is that of the restored film, which no matter how many countless viewings can still manage to bring a laugh to your lips, a tear to your eye, and a joy to your heart.</p></br><a href="../users/A2W00XKTTF1G0Z.html">A2W00XKTTF1G0Z</a><br/><p>ET - THE EXTRA TERRESTIAL is a timeless and fun movie. This is one of those films you can watch over and over and still feel the emotion. It was acclaimed to bring out the child in us all - but really it is a celebration of who we are.<p>Directed by Steven Spielberg (Raiders of the Lost Ark, Schindler's List), the film real star is not from this planet. Designed by Carlo Rambaldi (Dune, Close Encounters of the Third Kind), this little alien made history by doing the one thing that everyone else on this planet has problems with, making a friend. By making this friend - we as an audience learn about loyalty and love.<p>Standout performance by Henry Thomas (Gangs Of New York, Moby Dick) as Elliot and of course who could forget the screen debut of six-year-old Drew Barrymore (Charlie's Angels I & II, Ever After, Titan AE). Dee Wallace Stone (The Frighteners, Invisible Mom) and Peter Coyote (Sphere, Patch Adams) have some special moments too.<p>The real star is of course ET himself. Although complete made of metal and rubber and operated and controlled by over seventeen people, the little alien could emote volumes of feelings and really didn't say that much throughout the whole film.<p>The DVD extras are the best ever. There is two versions of the film - the original 1982 release and the enhanced 2002 20th Anniversary edition. There is even a separate version of the movie with the musical score performed live with a 200 piece orchestra by John Williams (Star Wars, Raiders Of The Lost Ark) at the actually 2002 world premiere of the Special Edition.<p>There is a 20th Anniversary retrospective and a reunion of all the cast where they talk about the film and its production. There is even a educational section on the planets in our solar system. The DVD is a must for every fan of science fiction and every person who enjoys a movie about love and friendship. I can not say enough about this film. Everyone should have a copy of this one. (11-22-02)</p></br></body></html>

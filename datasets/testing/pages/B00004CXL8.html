Melvin lives in an exclusive apartment in New York's Manhattan and is the scourge of the neighborhood.  He is afflicted with obsessive compulsive disorder but unlike many with the malady he acts out his self-centered narcissism with mean and cruel verbiage.  His across-the-hall neighbor is a gay contemporary artist named Simon (Greg Kinnear) who is a primary receiver of Melvin's hurtful jabs.  The only other person Melvin can relate to is a single mother of an asthmatic boy who is also the only waitress at a nearby diner that will wait on him.<br /><br />This unlikely trio come together thanks for a cute and well trained little dog named Verdell.  Melvin reluctantly cares for the pooch after his owner Simon is severely beaten by burglars.  He falls for the dog which gives him the opportunity to become friendly with his neighbor.  Melvin agrees to drive Simon to Baltimore to see his parents for money, as his art work isn't selling.  Melvin asks waitress Carol (nice work from Helen Hunt) to go along.  She feels obligated since Melvin had given her access to a top doctor who is now treating her son.  The trip doesn't go all that well for Melvin and Carol.  Both need companionship and more but Melvin's dickish personality continually gets in the way.  One of the great lines in the movie is when Carol fishes for a complement from Melvin at dinner.  She had gotten dressed up and was expecting something along the lines of how nice she looked.  Instead after minutes of deflection, Melvin says to her "You make me want to be a better man."  He then crushes the moment with something about her wearing a housedress after he bought a new suit.  Carol does strike up a nice relationship with Simon back at the hotel, even agreeing to pose nude for him.  Simon's energy and creativity returns.  But...well, he's still gay.<br /><br />This film won a Golden Globe for Best Picture in 1997 in addition to awards for Nicholson and Hunt.  The acting is complemented by Shirley Knight as Carol's mom, Cuba Gooding Jr. as Simon's agent and Skeet Ulrich as a model for Simon who eventually turns on him.  It is well written and directed by James L. Brooks with writing help from Mark Andrus.  The movie could have easily turned sappy as Melvin becomes nicer.  He never quite makes it but the ending gives us hope.  Well done.</p></br><a href="../users/AU25GMX57XBVO.html">AU25GMX57XBVO</a><br/><p>There are not many movies with Jack Nicholson in them I don't like.  As good as it gets is no exception in that it is vintage Jack Nicholson.  He plays his typical role of a pretty good guy but seems to get himself into trouble.  The movie I thought could use a PG-13 rating and not sure why the industry rated it R.  There as some scenes that might be a little disturbing but nothing too overboard.  Very entertaining comedy that will go down as one of Nicholson's best since he did win an oscar for it.  Helen Hunt also plays her typical drama role good as well.  A must see for any Nicholson fan.<br /><br />Peter J. Miller</p></br><a href="../users/A6VFFRIHAXKRL.html">A6VFFRIHAXKRL</a><br/><p>Just another random review this time I'm reviewing the 1997 movie As Good As it Gets. Directed by James L Brooks yes the same guy from The Simpsons movie he also directed Terms Of Enderment. It stars Jack Nicholson as Melvin, Helen Hunt as Carol Connelly, Greg Kinnar as Simon Bishop,  Cuba Gooding jr as Frank & Jesse James as Spencer Connelly.  Story is Melvin is obsessive compulsive novelist he doesn't get along with his neighbors in his apartment & he also hates his G  a  y neighbor Simon's dog & throws it down a shute into the garbage. When he's confronted on it Jack Nicholson gets some hilarious verbal ownage in " Never interrupt me again ok? Not if there is a fire not even if you hear the sound of a thud & ! week later there is a stench so bad that you have to hold a hanky over your face cause the stench is  from a decaying body. Even if it's election night & some fudge pa  c  k  er you date has been elected the 1st qu  e  e  r President of The US & he's on his way to Camp David & you want someone to share the moment with. Even then don't come knocking. Not for ANY reason. Do you get that sweetheart." It's like they wrote it for Jack Nicholson inn mind. He eats breakfast at the same restaurant every morning at the same table he has an interest in this waitress Carol Connelly she's the only 1 that tolerates him eventually she finds out what kind of man he is. His neighbor Simon was robbed by these thugs & beaten up pretty bad & has to go to the hospital his agent Frank forces him to take care of his dog.  Melvin becomes attached to the dog. Carol has a son Spencer he's acutely asthmatic Carol decides to get a job closer to home he can't adjust to the new waitress. He actually pays for the medical bills to get him the treatment he needs. Simon who is recuperating has lost his artistic will & close to being evicted. Frank asks Melvin to drive Simon to Baltimore to ask his parents for money. Melvin invites Carol to go she reluctantly agrees to go. From there we get some good character development & these people aren't perfect the portrayal is real. Melvin & Simon have a great back & forth. Like when Simon talks about his troubled childhood Melvin responds " Some of us have great stories pretty stories that take place on lakes & boats & Noodle Salad. Just no one in this car. But a lot of people that's their story good times noodle salad. What makes it so hard is not that you had it so bad but so many others had it good." You know I could go on & on but the performances are really good Jack Nicholson was great. Helen Hunt could be b  it  c  h  ybut she was still pretty good. Jesse James wasn't in it a lot but I cared about his character. Cuba Gooding Jr didn't have a whole lot to do but he was good for what he had to work with. Greg Kinnar was off & on to me but worked very well. So that's As Good As It Gets. & I'll have more random movie reviews.</p></br><a href="../users/A22RY8N8CNDF3A.html">A22RY8N8CNDF3A</a><br/><p>As Good as it Gets is just that.  A very good movie with Jack Nicholson playing the acerbic, rigid, but successful romance novalist, Melvin Udall.  He is a obsessive compulsive bachelor who lives alone and enjoys his daily routine.  Melvin enjoys breakfast every day at a local cafe and insists on a certain waitress, Carol Conelly (Helen Hunt).  His neighbor (Greg Kinnear) a gay painter, has an emergency and insists that Melvin take care of his cherished dog.  He knows Melvin is a stickler for detail and trusts Melvin.  Melvin also has to deal with Carol, who also must take off from work because her son is ill. This is too much change for Melvin, his world is turned upside down.  Profound changes await them all in this witty, touching tale.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear give a flawless perfomance and smart dialogue throughout.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F.html">A3FL6CIO8QIJ2F</a><br/><p>"As Good As It gets" is one of the best movies from the 1990's. Winner of the Oscar for Best Picture (1997), the film garnered Jack Nicholson another Academy Award for Best Actor and won Helen Hent the Oscar for Best Actress. Nicholson plays Melvin Udall who suffers from a mental illness called obsessive complusiveness (while walking on a sidewalk Melvin refuses to step on cracks!). Melvin also has the mouth of a sewer and isn't overly friendly, but while babysitting a neighbor's dog, and with the help of a kind and outgoing waitress, Melvin realizes the true meaning of friendship and how people are suppose to act with each other. "As Good As It Gets" was a hit at the boxoffice and was on many critics lists as the Best Picture of 1997. Everything about the movie jells, from the acting to the direction along with an excellent script. The movie co-stars Greg Kinnear as the gay neighbor and was directed by James L. Brooks. The disc, which is double sided, comes with both full and widescreen formats, commentary, and more. There is also an informative booklet that accompanies the set.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>It wasn't until I saw Jack Nicholson in A FEW GOOD MEN that I realized I had been unfair to the actor for many years.  Never one of my favorites, I always felt Nicholson just kept playing the same roles over and over.  But in his awesome performance in A FEW GOOD MEN, I finally saw what the critics and Oscar voters had already seen:  the man is an incredibly gifted actor.  In AS GOOD AS IT GETS, for which he won a Best Actor award, Nicholson parlays all of his usual tics and gestures into a superb portrait of an obsessive-compulsive man afraid of living life, and most definitely afraid of becoming involved with other people.  He is overtly nasty and one would never believe there was a real human being underneath all that venom.  However, once he "babysits" his neighbors precious pooch, we see a side of Melvin that lets us know there IS a real person beneat that cynically oppressive facade.  It's to Nicholson's credit that as he goes through the movie making mistake after mistake, we really hope he gets the girl in the end.  Helen Hunt in her Oscar winning performance is marvelous; she exudes an everyday commonality and a warmth rare in many of our actresses today.  While it's hard to believe she and Nicholson would ever hook up, Hunt's performance is so astutely controlled, we forget she's acting.  And Greg Kinnear (so good in Nurse Betty) is a revelation as the homosexual neighbor, Simon.  While not totally eschewing the stereotypical effeminance of homsexuality, Kinner displays a leading man swagger with the vulnerability of a lifestyle that can be challenging to say the least.  Kinnear was nominated for a supporting actor award, and he is definitely worthy of that nomination in this superbly nuanced performance.  Ditto to the marvelous Shirley Knight who plays Hunt's mother; while not on screen a great deal, Knight's relationship with her daughter is heartwarming and convincing.  Even Oscar winner Cuba Gooding Jr. redeems himself for Snow Dogs in a showy role as Kinnear's friend.  Director James L. Brooks shows a keen sense of knowing how to get the best from his actors, and AS GOOD AS IT GETS is a wonderful film to be enjoyed by all those who have been in love and didn't know it!</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>This is not a criticism of Jack Nicholson's work here as a writer with OCD,however, for him it is an average performance.  He has been better, most recently in "About Schmidt".  Jack has spoiled us throughout his career with performances of such high calibre that anything less, at least for me, is a disappointment.  I also bring this up because Nicholson won the Oscar for this role when he didn't bring home the gold for better work, but that's the nature of the beast.  Helen Hunt, on the other hand, gave the best screen performance of her career as the struggling waitress who relunctantly allows herself to fall in love with Nicholson's headcase.  I remember when this film came out that I found it implausible that Hunt could fall for Nicholson's character.  The women I related this to who had seen the film were emphatic that she could, that woman are not as superficial as men in that regard.  Such is my knowledge of the opposite sex.  It should also be noted that good work is delivered by Greg Kinnear as a gay artist, a change of pace for him from the usual cads he plays as well as Cuba Gooding Jr. as an art dealer.  This is a very good film but in retrospect I'm not sure it is worthy of the best picture nomination it snagged in 1997.  On the flip side, it is light years better than the bloated overrated vehicle named "Titanic" that did win that year.</p></br><a href="../users/AEGR40GALMDJ4.html">AEGR40GALMDJ4</a><br/><p>This movie did not do a lot for me.  I mean, it was a really boring pointless movie.  Sure, relationships did develop and the characters changed but it was really a snooze.  Helen Hunt should not have won the Oscar for Best Actress that she stole from Kate Winslet.  Jack did deserve, but this definately was not his best performance of his career by any standard.  The movie wasn't bad, it was just OK.</p></br><a href="../users/A1YQ6QB2127AJ4.html">A1YQ6QB2127AJ4</a><br/><p>"As Good As It Gets" is one of the best comedies released in 1997.  The plot of a man with OCD and a struggling waitress builds brilliantly as the movie continues.  As much as many may dislike the lead man, he is highly laughable.  Such comedy combines well with drama at the right places to give it the added flavor.  It combines attitude, laughter, romance, and family.  This movie rightfully earned seven Oscar nominations including Best Picture.<p>Two of those nominations became winners: Jack Nicholson for Best Actor and Helen Hunt for Best Actress.  Nicholson's role has the intensity that gives this film the added comedy.  His research into his character's disease and his characteristics showcase very well.  As always, no words can express how terrific his acting is.  Helen Hunt's role gives the film the drama it needs without removing the comedy.  Her performance is enough to make an audience cry.  Greg Kinnear's Oscar nominated role as a depressed gay man is one of the best performances of his career.  All the other actors also performed wonderfully: Jamie Kennedy, Skeet Ulrich, Cuba Gooding Jr., and many more(even the dog).<p>"As Good As It Gets" is a great movie for those who are looking for a unique comedy.  Everybody will be entertained.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BJOEQSRX2IBM.html">A1BJOEQSRX2IBM</a><br/><p>This is one of the best comedies of the 90's. It is extremely entertaining and features perfect performances by an all-star cast. Jack Nicholson really shines as Melvin Udall, a role he was born to play. Helen Hunt and  Greg Kinnear are also brilliant as Carol the waitress and Simon the f@g,  respectively. James L. Brooks manages to write a refreshingly funny  screenplay with perfectly drawn characters. It has some great insights on  what lonelyness can do to a man and how relationships with other people can  change your life. Extremely entertaining comedy. From a scale of 1-10 I  give this film an 8!</p></br><a href="../users/AMMEMPM9MPS55.html">AMMEMPM9MPS55</a><br/><p>Another reviewer comments that the events in this film conspire to make Jack Nicholson (or rather Melvyn Udall) a human being. On the contrary, this is a film where the central character, an obsessive-compulsive bigot, is human from the start: We just don't realize it. A key moment in the film is when Simon, Melvin's gay neighbour (Greg Kinnear), is telling the young male prostitute, Vincent (Skeet Ulrich), about his art, and comments that he likes to watch people because sometimes, when you look at someone long enough, "you see their humanity." At that point Vincent is momentarily enabled to see something beyond the seedy world of male prostitution; at the same time Simon gives us the interpretive key to the whole movie. It is a film about three very different people who discover their common humanity.<p>Melvin is a hateful and insensitive recluse with a debilitating mental disorder; Carol (Helen Hunt), a Manhattan waitress struggling with her son's chronic illness and finding her identity swallowed up in the process; Simon, a gay artist who loses everything when he is attacked and robbed in his own home. One by one they must learn to see the humanity in each other and, as importantly, in themselves ("Where'd I go?" asks Simon as he looks at the reflection of his battered face in the mirror). We, too, must learn to see the human being underneath the spiteful and vicious (if somewhat the "loveable rogue") in Melvin.<p>The theme is developed sensitively and beautifully throughout the course of the film (perhaps only slightly overlong at more than two hours), with help coming from a fourth character, Verdelle, a dog, whose pivotal role in the narrative is easily overlooked (standing in the same cinematic tradition as Toto of "The Wizard of Oz"). By the end of the film, we are aware that the big issues in the character's lives are still to be totally overcome, but the process of resolution has begun as it should, with the characters each recognizing the dignity and worth of the others (and themselves).<p>James L. Brook's delicate direction carefully avoids excessive sentimentalism and saccharine sweetness (though admittedly, it teeters perilously close to the edge at times), and results in one of the most charming and profound comedies of recent years.</p></br><a href="../users/A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH.html">A3Q1FVRV0CRYTH</a><br/><p>And that my friends is a rarity.  I'm new to the 'As Good as it Gets' fanclub sort-a-speak since I, for the first time, saw it last night despite the fact that my wife HATES the movie and was pissed I rented it.  I have always been a fan of Jack Nicholson for he has been on top of his game for YEARS and doesn't show any sign of letting up anytime soon (I mean, he's won 3 oscars and has been nominated 12 times).  I've also always enjoyed Hunt and Kinnear so it's a shoe-in for me to enjoy this film right?  I just for some reason have never had the desire to see it, and then there I was walking through the local blockbuster thinking, you know what, I'll just go for it, and I'm so glad I did.  Right off the bat Nicholson is at his best playing the grumpy old man, but he always adds just the right amount of class and confidence to lift him from Walter Matthau status and place him in the Michael Caine league.  Nicholson plays Melvin, an obsesive compulsive racist bigot sexist grump of a man who is hated by everyone and very well may like it that way.  He lives in the same apartment complex as Simon (Kinnear) a gay painter who is the subject of Melvin's vented anger (which is displayed by his constant verbal battery of poor Simon and the abuse he inflicts of Simon's dog) but after Simon is beaten and injured Melvin is pusuaded (a bit forcfully) to take care of Simon's dog.  Unexpectedly Melvin forms an attachment to the dog and is somehow changed by his experience and moved to be a nicer, better person.  He starts by helping a local waitress Carol (Hunt) who may just be the only person who tolerates him.  Carol & Melvin & Simon throughout the remander of the film form a bond that is both unexpected and remarkably beautiful.  Helen Hunt is wonderful in this film, as is Kinnear, but it's Nicholson's show and there isn't a better man for the show.  I have never watched a performance that made me more anxious then watching Nicholson say the WRONG thing everytime, but as Carol realizes, he has his moments, and those moments are about as good as it gets.</p></br><a href="../users/AYG1U47VFZ165.html">AYG1U47VFZ165</a><br/><p>I hate to admit it, but I've never been a fan of Jack Nicholson.<p>Also, I've never been smitten with the lovely Helen Hunt.<p>Lastly, Greg Kinnear has always been REALLY too smarmy for me.<p>However, somehow AS GOOD AS IT GETS has a special place in my heart.<p>Nicholson is absolutely fabulous as the neurotic writer who, due to circumstances wildly beyond his control, has to not so much step outside of his comfort zone as he has to destroy the barriers that have isolated him from society when the people that make up the routine of his life  -- eating at the corner restaurant, pestering the gay neighbors -- start to come apart at the seams.  The crusty exterior, we learn, is just a facade, and the man underneath -- while not perfect -- accepts that life is worth living ... as good as it gets.<p>Helen Hunt is absolutely radiant in the role as the corner shop waitress who's forced to deal with Nicholson's habits ... and, much to her surprise and the audience, she begins to experience true emotion for the man.<p>Greg Kinnear plays the struggling artist role to perfection.  He has bouts of great self-esteem countered by comic moments of heightened anxiety, and the subtlety he brings to his portrayal is may be all-too-Hollywood but is surprisingly human.<p>A perfect mix, this film is about AS GOOD AS IT GETS.</p></br><a href="../users/A11ED8O95W2103.html">A11ED8O95W2103</a><br/><p>I'm not a fan of the romantic comedy genre, and I winced a bit when my wife suggested this movie, but I'd be lying if I said anything other than I very much enjoyed it.<br /><br />I figured Jack Nicholson would draw me into the story.  I can't say I'm a big Jack Nicholson fan, but I always seem to become quickly interested in movies that he stars in.  Perhaps I'm just a Jack Nicholson fan in denial.<br /><br />Helen Hunt to me is the driving force behind this movie.  I do think I became a Helen Hunt fan.  No denial there.<br /><br />However, what makes the whole thing work is the supporting cast.  Everyone is good.  We've even got Yeardley Smith, the voice of Lisa Simpson!  Then there's the dog; perhaps the cutest ugly dog ever.<br /><br />Anyway, unlike others I doubt I'll watch this movie again, but I'm sure glad I saw it once.  Not quite "as good as it gets" for me in terms of movies, but way way better than I thought it would be.</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>Jack Nicholson is a national treasure: those erratic, errant eyebrows, that rubbery face, those quick mood shifts, his overall nuttiness. In this film he's a screwball obsessive-compulsive who hates everyone except his waitress, Helen Hunt. They barely tolerate each other. This misanthrope hates his gay neighbor Greg Kinnear and the guy's little pooch who nearly steals the movie. Jack drops the dog in the garbage shoot of their apartment building.<br /> Jack mugs, sulks, gloats, and turns his face into a myriad of reactions. He has plenty of money so he is able to manipulate people. When Kinnear gets badly beaten up, Jack ends up taking care of the mutt which is the beginning of his conversion. It is the story of how he rejoins the human race by helping out Helen and Greg who infuse humanity into this creep.<br /> It's a movie with a lot of laughs brought on by one of the biggest hams in the business. This flick, without him, let's say with Robin Williams, could have turned into a saccharine, schmaltzy, gooey mess. Jack is a comedic master, but one sometimes wonders where Jack leaves off, and the role he is playing begins. Is he always just playing Jack? Maybe kookiness isn't that much of a stretch for him.</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>One of the finest romantic comedies ever made! The entire cast is excellent in this well written tale of love that is not so perfect. The movie deals with much more than an impossible romance and is sharp,blunt, and clever in it's execution of many social issues. This movie should be seen by all movie lovers even if you don't like "romantic comedies". The DVD transfer is good and you can find this is the bargain bins for $5.00!.....A bargain indeed!</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Lots of movies I liked pretty well the first time I saw them weren't nearly as appealing when I see them again some years later.<p>I recently saw this movie for the third time on DVD, and darn if it doesn't get more delicious every time.<p>The writing is so crisp it snaps.  The acting is so pleasurable it's like being ring-side at a 3-ring circus.  The direction, photography, set design, art direction, etc.<p>I hear often in recent reviews that Jack Nicholson is given roles where he gets, essentially, to play Jack Nicholson.  This is not to imply that Jack is any flavor of heartless romance writer with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder - but it means that the &quot;Jack&quot; we get to see in this movie seems a good guy to spend 2 hours with.  Helen Hunt, Cuba Gooding, Jr and Greg Kinnear make perfect stand-ins for our desire to &quot;hang out with Jack&quot;.<p>This is the movie that &quot;Something's Gotta Give&quot; desperately wants to be - yet this film exceeds that more recent work by pretty much every measurable marker.  <p>I'll watch this film probably once a year as long as I live.

Jack Nicholson has had several performances as memorable as this one, but he has never had one that was appreciably better.  As the child of an intensely obsessive-compulsive father, his performance especially hit home with me (as I was watching this movie with my daughter, I asked her, "Does Jack Nicholson remind you of anyone?" and she immediately shouted, "Grandpa!--out of the mouth of babes).  <p>The brilliant thing about this movie is that it doesn't just stop with a character with a serious social-psychological problem, but deals with his attempts to break out of his mental prison to engage in normal relationships.  Partly this is done through his unexpected relationship with a neighbor's small dog.  Partly this is achieved by what is initially a selfish concern with the difficulties of a waitress with a son with serious health problems (selfish because her absence from the restaurant to deal with her son's health problems upsets his dining routine; he would rather pay out money to help her son than have her miss taking his order for his meal).  Gradually, however, he develops a concern for the waitress (Helen Hunt) not merely as the woman who takes his orders, but as a human being.  Eventually, in his own highly limited way, he sorta, kinda falls in love, to a degree that he is able to utter one of the most romantic lines I have heard in a film:  "You make me wish I was a better man."  He isn't a better man; he isn't even an especially desirable match.  But she is able to accept his affection, with all his limitations as a person.  It isn't the Disney version, but it is all rather lovely.<p>The cast is by and large excellent.  Both Nicholson and Helen Hunt won Oscars for their performances.  I didn't care for Cuba Gooding Jr.'s rather campy gay character, though I suspect the problem was more in the way his part was written than in his performance.  I thought Greg Kinnear was OK as a gay artist and neighbor to Nicholson (in addition to being the owner of the dog), but like Gooding, I could never really accept him as being gay.  But the picture is carried by two superb performances by Nicholson and Hunt.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z9XBCYT3AHHU.html">A2Z9XBCYT3AHHU</a><br/><p>this is a funny film, with some of the greatest lines ever written for jack nicholson--and he has had some great ones. but helen hunt has started to get on my nerves the more i watch this film. i've not been a big fan of hers and in this movie she just feels abnoxious. still, thankfully it doesnt take too much away from the great acting by both jack nicholson and greg kinnear, who was truly wonderful as the gay neighbor.</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>The '97 release 'As Good As It Gets' is an immensely entertaining and touching comedy romance with the rare ability to make you cry and laugh simultaneously.

The thing that seperates this film from most is the power to make you bust out in laughter one second and wiping away tears the next. Jack Nicholson delivers my favorite performance of his career and deserved that Oscar, as did Helen Hunt in her best role. I truly think Greg Kinnear deserved the Oscar over Robin Williams in &quot;Good Will Hunting.&quot; Jack was weirdly great, but Kinnear was so convincing as the soul of the movie, who helped mold others around him rather than changing himself or his past. Also, this movie has almost as many great quotes as Monty Python or the Princess Bride and thats really saying something. So, if you want to see an excellent movie for a nice romantic evening with someone special or if you just want to watch a movie that will have you cherishing it long after the fading bakery scene, buy this movie for the extremely worthy and reasonable price.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>When Hollywood gets it right, they get it really right.  Such is the case with this movie, which combines excellent talent with a winning script.  This movie is a character study as is the Jack Nicholson film "About Schmidt," but the latter was too serious and had too much art to be a fraction as entertaining as "As Good As It Gets."<p>Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson) is an obsessive-compulsive writer who lives a nearly reclusive life in his apartment.  In addition to being obsessive-compulsive, he is also a bigot and his acerbic personality wins him no friends and many people who would rather not see him.  Jack Nicholson was perfect for this role, bringing elements of characters we've seen him play in films that range from "The Shining" to "The Witches of Eastwick."<p>Several additional characters are introduced to fully explain Melvin's personality and how his personality changes throughout the course of the movie.  Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear) is a homosexual artist with significant psychological baggage of his own.  Simon has a small dog that is used to exploit a crack in Marvin's personality.  Simon also ultimately is the recipient of one of two compliments from Marvin that show how much Marvin changes in the course of the film.  Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt) is the only waitress that will serve Marvin at the restaurant that he goes to every day.  Carol has a son who has asthma and allergies and is constantly sick.  Carol has little money and her entire life is focused on her son.  Frank Sachs (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) is standout as Simon's agent and friend.  There are dozens of other roles that support these characters with a wondrous complexity that generates the pathos, beauty and ultimately good feelings at the end of the movie.<p>(...)It's easy to pick out the flaws with this movie.  However, pass the flaws by to look at the beauty of the characters and how they interact and evolve in the course of the movie.  These actors are very good at their art and the astute viewer will fall in love with them and be left at the end of the movie feeling as though they have had a wonderful experience, without the director ever having had to result to maudlin sentiment to manipulate the viewer's feelings.  This heavily awarded movie is well worth having in a library of classics and worth watching again and again.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>Jack Nicholson has a certain character down pat, and has played that character with variations for the last decade.  When Jack Nicholson plays obsessive-compulsive Melvin Udall, a reclusive writer with a routine so set that even the most minor deviation causes mental anguish, the results are continuously hilarious.<p>To be funny Jack requires other good actors, and in this movie Jack gets Helen Hunt as waitress and love interest Carol Connelly, Greg Kinnear as alternate lifestyle artist Simon Bishop, Cuba Gooding as Greg's agent Frank Sachs, and a wonderful little dog named Verdell.<p>As you would expect Melvin holds rigid opinions about everyone and everything.  Fortunately he rarely has to interface with anyone at length, so his unreserved comments about others rarely offend others to the point where they refuse to deal with him, or worse, hit him.  However, two events conspire to force Melvin to change.<p>First, Simon is beat up by a group of men robbing his house.  Someone has to take care of Verdell the dog, and Melvin is forced into taking care of Verdell by Cuba Gooding.  At first Melvin is completely unable to tolerate the dog, but the dog slowly wins Melvin over, putting a small chink into Melvin's curmudgeon armor.<p>The second event that upsets Melvin's rigid life is that Carol misses a day of work.  Melvin must be served by Carol or his breakfast routine just is not right.  Melvin finds Carol at her house and discovers that she is being kept at home by her sick son.  Not letting anything stand in his way, Melvin arranges for a doctor to take care of Carol's son.  As Melvin gets to know Carol better, her opinion of him starts to matter, and Melvin finds that he is falling in love with Carol.  I leave the rest of this story to the viewer.<p>It is easy to find fault with Jack Nicholson in this role because this role was his with little or no effort.  However, it matters not that this role fits with Jack Nicholson's character so well that you would think Jack is just like his character in real life, what matters is that Jack is perfectly believable.  The change that we see in Jack throughout this movie and the interactions with the various characters that brings about this change is the heart of this movie.  That watching the change is humorous and makes you feel good is just that much more benefit.<p>This movie is the rare funny, feel good movie that makes you want to watch it again.  Perhaps the theme is just a bit trite, but we all want to believe in the core good of all people.  Watch this movie and enjoy the easy smile it puts on your face.</p></br><a href="../users/AF8C86SGYLH81.html">AF8C86SGYLH81</a><br/><p>If you've never seen a Jack Nicholson film, or have been repulsed by some of his previous flicks, GO SEE THIS FILM!!!  It is a cinema classic.  Helen Hunt is so sincere, hard, and cute...in this film that reminds me of a Spielberg classic.  It tugs at the strings of your heart.</p></br><a href="../users/A2Z28WKY1LHBKY.html">A2Z28WKY1LHBKY</a><br/><p>As doggone doggedly doggy as could be. There is some kind of unbridgeable cultural social divide between America and the rest of us when it comes to this type of material. What apparently seems so delightful and Oscar-worthy over there just strikes the Old World as incredibly yukky and fake. The extra star is for Helen Hunt, who did the best that could be done with the cringe-making script. Like someone said, Jack could have sleep-walked through this role; and I think he did. That cute little tyke looked female to me, but they kept calling it boy. Embarrassing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2XRZV63X79YSJ.html">A2XRZV63X79YSJ</a><br/><p>I was not expecting to like this film.  The cast was a group of actors that weren't on my A list and I have never been impressed by James L Brooks' movies (loved his television work but not his films).  I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson plays Melvin Udell, a compulsive obsessive writer.  Everything in is live is constant from how he locks his door to having the same table at his corner restaurant.  This is a typical quirky Nicholson role but the difference is that this character grows throughout the film.<br /><br />Helen Hunt plays Carol Connelly, the only waitress that Melvin will allow to wait on him.  Everything in her live is chaos from her job to her chronically ill son.  This is a tour de force performance.  She gets to show the gamut of emotion during this film.<br /><br />Greg Kinnear plays Nicholson's neighbor Simon Bishop.  Melvin shows no restraint in his distaste of Simon's lifestyle.  This is Kinnear's breakout performance.<br /><br />When Simon is beaten up, Melvin is forced into his life.  Melvin forces his way into<br /><br />Carol's life when her son condition worsens.  In the end, Melvin uses Simon's need to visit his parents to get Carol to come on the road trip.  This road trip is the best part of the film.  Each character is forced to grow a little and has some of the best one liners.<br /><br />The only problem with this film is to accurately classify it.  It starts out as a social comedy but develops into a romantic comedy.  Whatever it is you should enjoy it.<br /><br />BEST LINE: "You make me want to be a better man" and "What if this is as good as it gets".<br /><br />DVD EXTRAS: Commentary by Brooks, Nicholson, Hunt and Kinnear</p></br><a href="../users/A16CZRQL23NOIW.html">A16CZRQL23NOIW</a><br/><p>A selfish and uninspired writer finds in the cynicism his own shield, helmet and weapon to face the world. Around him there is a living world, limited according his vision: his neighbor with his emotional world and his beloved dog; on the other hand a responsible mother who works hard in a Deli with a profound pain.<br /><br />Inside this normal selfishness, the daily encounter with this single but very worried woman will become a real breakthrough in his values code. The world is too much wider and complex than he really thinks, its particular universe trying to eviscerate the mysteries of the human soul through the creation of his characters finds him out of context in this case.<br /><br />Through a smart script that includes a set of funny vignettes,  the power of love will gradually loom and dictate finally the expected bliss. Jack Nicholson once more is towering with this role; unbearable, neurotic and troublemaker character. Helen Hunt `s performance is impeccable; she will experiment a wide specter of emotions, blending sympathy, sympathy and pain. Cuban Gooding Jr is magnificent too in his brief but well reminded appearance, radiant, freshness and spontaneous humor. And the breathtaking revelation of Greg Kinnear in his very difficult role, making to date his best achievement on the screen.<br /><br />And for this lovable pet, a sonorous applause, one of the best dog performances ever made.<br /><br />An emblematic author film with a low budget concerning to special effects or car chases, but provided with a great doses of talent by all the team. Dazzling direction and memorable artistic direction.<br /><br />A recent classic.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ1H3VLCDR298.html">AZ1H3VLCDR298</a><br/><p>This movie is absolutely one of the best movies to come around in a long time. It goes down to the deepest levels of the human spirit, and triumphs. Jack Nicholson gives his best performance since &quot;One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot; and really shows us that anybody can become a better person. He plays a romance novelist who has Obessesive Compulsive Disorder with an attitude less than human at times. People around him think he is just another jerk, but with his disorder he is usually not aware he is offending people, until it is too late. I have OCD myself, and after having seen this movie with my family, I have been compared to him in many ways. I can control it most of the time now, but this Nicholson's character Melvin Yudall does not realize he is affecting people negatively (or even cares) until late in his life. He is really just a lonely man with no friends, who isolates himself in his apartment when he writes, and has very little social skills. Greg Kinnear plays his neighbor who dislikes him greatly, for reasons shown in the film.(Kinnear gives an outstanding performance and should have won the Oscar for best supporting actor that year) He plays a man who after a brutal attack directed at him must come to grips with himself again and regain his self-worth. Also featured is Helen Hunt, who gives a wonderful performance as the waitress who waits on Nicholson at his favorite diner. The character development grows between Nicholson and Hunt and Kinnear and Nicholson until eventually all three story lines intersect. Some of you may not have seen this film yet, so I won't give away any of the details. But let me tell you as someone who has been there, and has felt the same feelings and desires as Melvin, that this movie gave me a lot of inspiration and hope that I pray will be felt by many others with the same situation. This is a feel-good movie, with rich, detailed characters portrayed by actors who fit into the roles like a glove. This movie was nominated for many oscars, but this was the Year of Titanic, and pulled away with best actor and actress nods for Nicholson and Hunt. When you watch this movie, you actually feel for these 3 people, and you want them to be happy with their lives, which is what's missing from many movies these days. James L. Brooks, who is at his finest, co-wrote and directed this movie with such spirit. This film is a triumph, on many levels.</p></br><a href="../users/ABX7SEE84DMLU.html">ABX7SEE84DMLU</a><br/><p>I'd not seen this celebrated movie until very recently.<br /><br />It wears very, very well after almost ten years.  The cast is mismatched, to be sure:  placing a heavyweight like Jack Nocholson alongside Helen (who?) Hunt and Greg Kinnear would seem funny itself if it wasn't exactly what they did.  And the writing is much, much better than OK.<br /><br />My reflection, though, is on how media portry OCD.  "Monk" has given tv viewers a sense of the disease as played out by the title character.  It almost seems as though Monk's OCD helps him solve cases and is better at his job.<br /><br />This film focuses more on OCD as a disease, which is what it is.  Nicholson is successful and productive, but deeply unhappy and chained to his disorder. The "salvation" depicted in this movie is how personal relationships can help an enslaved person escape the bonds of OCD.<br /><br />It's a great movie with great performances, and was drenched with Oscars as a result.  What may be overlooked, though, is how we learn, almost unconsciously, about a real human disease.<br /><br />You'll love it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M5FI4CB6VUXF.html">A2M5FI4CB6VUXF</a><br/><p>What's not to like about this movie? Cuba Gooding Jr., Greg Kennear, Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson as an OCD-suffering shut-in with a penchant for saying exactly what's on his mind.<br /><br />This movie renders some of the more classic lines in cinematic history, including "Sell crazy some place else. We're all stocked up here." And the ever popular "You make me wanna be a better man." There's no telling how many 16 year old boys got to go a little further with their unsuspecting prom dates after uttering that line.<br /><br />The movie itself tackles a lot of social issues in a very subtle if tactful but direct manner. It was very well done and very smart in the delivery of a moral that's all about accepting the differences of those around us and living in a world where love and respect for said differences truly can conquer all.</p></br><a href="../users/A9Q28YTLYREO7.html">A9Q28YTLYREO7</a><br/><p>who hasn't already seen this film done oh say about 75-80 different times already?Helen Hunt is a so/so actress.nothing really special about her character.as for Jack Nicholson is he ever gonna change his style? to me he  is just like the Rolling Stones.some good songs here&amp;there but after a  while everything starts all sounding the same.well that's the case with  Nicholson all of his movies he plays an Arrogant Man.this is one of the  many reasons why i don't watch award shows they like to much  sameness.there's nothing special about this film at all.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OLJM7IREKPWZ.html">A2OLJM7IREKPWZ</a><br/><p>This movie that I have on dvd is a real show stopper.<br /><br />It's touching<br /><br />Funny<br /><br />romantic<br /><br />sincere<br /><br />straightforward<br /><br />I loved the cam angles and everything about the sets they used to film<br /><br />The locations were just marvelous<br /><br />Everything from the diner scenes to the apartment<br /><br />Nice wardrobes were picked out too<br /><br />My regards to the stylist too<br /><br />Cunning crafty movie.<br /><br />Go rent it<br /><br />I loved it<br /><br />I'm sure you will<br /><br />peace</p></br><a href="../users/A3M5O6UHXO9IBU.html">A3M5O6UHXO9IBU</a><br/><p>One of those frustrating flicks that doesn't know when to quit while it's ahead.

Granted, Kinear's performance is the best of his career thus far, and Nicholson is always a delight, and his Melvin manages to be repulsive and endearing at the same time.  Helen Hunt's performance was inexplicably Oscar-worthy, and I wasn't as impressed with her as the other two leads.  Her accent fluctuates on several occasions, which I found distracting.<p>I received the DVD as a gift, and thankfully, the commentary made me appreciate the movie more.  Commentary is provided by Brooks, Nicholson, Hunt and Kinnear.  It really helped me to view the film in different lights, and now I appreciate the movies more subtle tones.<p>This is definitely a worthwhile addition to your DVD collection.</p></br><a href="../users/AIFNOZKR9WTYI.html">AIFNOZKR9WTYI</a><br/><p>There's a lotta bruthas out there flakin an perpetratin but scared to kick reality.  This particular playa (Jack Nicholson) got the OCD chronic, yo.  But what interests this G is that one of the main symptoms of OCD is recurrent, abhorrent, anxiety-provoking thoughts of doing violence to those close to you - i.e. poppin a cap in your homies, though you think this sort of thing is to-the-curb.  Which is exactly what Jack Nicholson had going on in The Shining.  The intrusive unacceptable thoughts are what motivate the ritualistic behaviors.  In The Shining, Jack had the bad ideas, in As Good as it Gets, he's got the rituals.  If you could somehow combine these two movies in your mind, you'd get a complete picture of Nicholson's mental illness.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>Well-deserved Oscars went to Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt, and Greg Kinnear offered terrific support as well in this gem of a film.  This is the kind of film that can be watched multiple times and one still finds things to enjoy in it.  The Amazon review and synopsis really cover the basics of this film, but the heart of this film belongs to one line said by Nicholson, "You make me want to be a better man."<br /><br />We are all victims of our circumstances and idiosyncracies at times, but we need to strive to get past them.  This is typified in Nicholson's line quoted above to Helen Hunt's character and in his later lines when he barges into his psychologist's office unannounced and where he complains about such conduct until Jack cuts him off with, "You can't treat me for obssessive complusive disorders and then complain about when I committ such actions like I have a choice in the matter."  Hysterical and all too true.<br /><br />This is a truly moving film with real life like characters that we grow to appreciate if not love.  I just love pulling this film down off my shelf to watch every so often.  My wife and I love it every time we watch it.  It's the kind of film that never gets old.  Nicholson is reliable and believable as always, and Helen Hunt is so much better than she's often given credit for being.  She is smart, beautiful, relatable, and enormously talented.  Greg Kinnear really shows that he has acting chops and his career following this film has proven that his performance here was no fluke.<br /><br />This movie soars on every level.  This film is as good as it gets it.</p></br><a href="../users/AYWAY5MKLAITN.html">AYWAY5MKLAITN</a><br/><p>Melvin is a famous author, writer of over sixty books.

Jack Nicholson dispenses insults with his one-in-a-billion sense of delivery, and if you like serious comedies, this is the film for you. Helen Hunt is masterful in her portrayal of a hard-luck single mother who befriends Nicholson's oddball character, and Greg Kinnear does well as the neighbor who faces hard times himself. Home to a well-written screenplay exhibiting superb direction from James L. Brooks, As Good As It Gets makes a place for itself in the annals of movie history...<br /><br />Jack Nicholson stars as cranky, bitter, semi-shut-in novelist Melvin Udall who suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder. Everyday, like clockwork, Melvin eats breakfast at the same diner where he brings his own utensils and is waited on by the same waitress (the only one who will agree to serve him), Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt). Despite his eccentricities, the two form a sort of unspoken understanding of each other. Meanwhile, Melvin's neighbor, Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear), a homosexual artist who is often the object of Melvin's bigoted comments, entertains the elite art circles of New York. Simon's dog forms a further divide between the two when Simon drops him down the trash chute to stop his barking.<br /><br />When Simon is attacked in his home and left beaten and unable to create his art, all of his friends abandon him and the bills are left unpaid. Melvin, having reluctantly agreed to take care of the dog in Simon's absence, develops an attachment for the dog. Meanwhile, Carol Connelly leaves the diner in order to better take care of her sick son. Distraught, Melvin offers to pay for treatments in order to have Carol back as his waitress once again. With each character struggling with personal tragedies, the three slowly develop a respect for each other and a friendship which only grows...<br /><br />Co-stars Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt swept the leading role Oscars for the male and female categories, and their onscreen relationship is one of the more memorable in cinema history. Forming a love/hate relationship and bonding through their various travails, Melvin Udall and Carol Connelly are one of the true odd couples of tinsel town. In fact, if a cast of lesser abilities had played the roles, the film would have been a drastic failure because such relationships would simply be unbelievable. Playing the role of Melvin's gay neighbor Simon, Greg Kinnear made a name for himself and entered into the hallowed halls of the who's who of Hollywood.<br /><br />With an all-star cast that includes several Academy Award winners (Cuba Gooding, Jr. won for Jerry Maguire), As Good As It Gets rests its fortunes on the backs of its quirky and sometimes neurotic band of characters. More than able to meet the task, Nicholson, Hunt, and Kinnear strike gold with this Best Picture candidate which combines drama and comedy into a unique, one-of-a-kind experience. With one-liners zinging from Nicholson in almost every scene, you'll be hard pressed not to laugh out loud. And with Kinnear and Hunt to bring a serious note to Nicholson's strange character, As Good As It Gets breaks into the ranks of a short list of all-time great films. It's one you definitely won't want to miss...<br /><br />The DVD Report</p></br><a href="../users/A2RHQMV5GD18Z8.html">A2RHQMV5GD18Z8</a><br/><p>As Good as It Gets (1997)<br />Comedy, Drama, Romance, 139 minutes<br />Directed by James L. Brooks<br />Starring Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt and Greg Kinnear<br /><br />As Good as It Gets blends drama, comedy and romance so well that it's hard to decide which category the movie falls into. Nominated for seven Oscars, Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt took home the leading actor honors. It was a competitive year with Titanic, L.A. Confidential and Good Will Hunting also in the running.<br /><br />It's hard to choose Nicholson's top performance with so many candidates choose from, but this has to rank among his best and he thoroughly deserved his third Oscar win. Nicholson plays author Melvin Udall. He lives alone and seems to hate most of the world around him. One of his least favorite people is his homosexual neighbor, Simon (Kinnear). In contrast, one of his favorite people is Carol (Hunt). From Melvin's point of view she's the only competent waitress at his local diner.<br /><br />As the story unfolds, we learn more about these three people. Melvin has OCD and we see him avoiding cracks in the pavement. He's severely messed up in a number of other ways too. Carol puts on a brave face at work, but she has to deal with her sick son on a daily basis and it's a heavy burden. Simon is an artist and seems to be intimidated by Melvin's attitude toward him.<br /><br />Nicholson is such a good actor and has incredible range. Think back to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest for an example of how he can inject comedy into serious drama. I think his ability to make people laugh is often overlooked. As Melvin, he highlights that ability. Melvin isn't a very nice human being, but Nicholson actually makes us root for him. Carol is a positive influence and is the main reason he tries to change. Melvin does care about people, but it's buried beneath the surface.<br /><br />Nicholson makes us believe that a 60-year-old man with psychological problems is capable of attracting a woman in her early 30s. Kinnear plays Simon just about perfectly and was nominated for the performance. He also shows plenty of comedic ability and times everything well. The interplay between the three characters is fascinating and comes to a head when they take a trip together.<br /><br />The film contains some of the best dialogue I have heard. Some scenes will bring you close to tears while others will make you laugh. It's a shame that Nicholson and Hunt weren't given more opportunities to make films such as this.</p></br><a href="../users/A2VJ80PM1G00QV.html">A2VJ80PM1G00QV</a><br/><p>Back when Homer was a wee lad some thousands of years ago, he heard the then ancient story of the grouchy old man whose life is turned around by a beautiful young women. He built it into one of his many monologues so that ultimately it moved from the oral to the written tradition in what we think of as Ancient Greece. Since that time story tellers have repeated the tale with many variations, but it remains basically the same: Love Conquers All. Having plenty of cash available, Brooks and his backers were willing to insure success by giving a great deal of it to Jack Nicholson and lesser amounts to his co-stars and the remainder of the cast. The result: a first rate romantic comedy likely to make its two hours and twenty minutes seem but a few minutes of pleasure. Nicholas as the Grouch and Kinnear as his gay neighbor, play their roles as if they were made for them (as they were); Hunt, as the girl in the story, manifests some of her characteristic acting oddities, but, on the whole, holds her own. This is a good one likely to entertain most people</p></br><a href="../users/A1534MBU6VJXYN.html">A1534MBU6VJXYN</a><br/><p>Looking back on the 1997 Academy Awards, it still makes me sick that "Titanic" won best picture. That was box office hype at its worst, as the film only won because it was this gargantuan box office hit. Had this film flopped, then there's no doubt in my mind that either "Good Will Hunting" or this brilliant comedy would have won Best Picture. Far better than that film that should have sank like the ship it was named for, "As Good As It Gets" is wihtout a doubt one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Of course, since it was written by comedy mastermind James L. Brooks ("Terms Of Endearment", "The Mary Tyler Moore Show", "The Simpsons"), you can't expect anything less than a comedic work of art (though "Spanglish" was little underwhelming).<br /><br />Jack Nicholson quite possibly the finest performance of his career as novelist Melvin Udall, a rude (to put it mildly), middle aged man with an extreme case of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder who's going through a serious writer's block/mid-life crisis. He is the most unlikable man in New York City, with no compssion for animals, women or his homosexual neighbor (a perfectly cast Greg Kinear) and his art dealer friend Frank (Cuba Gooding, Jr.). He bring hiw own silverwear to his favorite restaurant in town, where he must be served by his favorite waitress, Carol (Helen Hunt), who even he treats rudely. However, something changes. When his neighbor is beaten up by vicious thugs, Melvin is forced to watch his beloved dog. Though uneasy at first, Melvin and the dog become great friends. In fact, when his real owner comes home, the dog prefers to stay with Melvin (the scene where Kinear impersonates Nicholson is priceless). Melvin is starting to develope feelings for Carol as well. The problem is, she's too busy caring for her son to take notice - plus she doesn't like him anyway. As the film unfolds, a trip upstate ties everything together, as all the characters become better people - including Melvin.<br /><br />This film is one of the true films in cinema that can be considered perfect. The writing is on the money, the directing is excellent and all the performances were top notch (Nicholson and Hunt deserved their Oscars, and Kinear and Gooding were great as well). The audio comentary was good (it was nice to hear the somewhat reclusive Nicholson offer his intake), and the film is a true must have movie.</p></br><a href="../users/ABN5K7K1TM1QA.html">ABN5K7K1TM1QA</a><br/><p>Brilliantly written, brilliantly acted and cleanly directed, this strange and wonderful tale is one of the best romantic comedies ever to hit the silver screen. Helen Hunt, as an unmarried thirtysomething waitress with a asthmatic five-year-old boy, is exquisite. Jack Nicholson, as a weird and mean obsessive/compulsive writer named Melvin Udall, is even better than he usually is, and he is one of the great actors of our time, and even Greg Kinnear in a supporting role as the sensitive gay guy next door is outstanding.<br /><br /> Of course I love impossible love, unrequited love, love that takes decades to culmination. This is a case of impossible love come true. Eat your heart out Nora Ephron! And you too Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. But I couldn't help but think, considering the principals, how impossible it really is on another level. But never mind, in fact, all the better.<br /><br /> James L. Brooks, who directed and who, along with Mark Andrus (from his story) wrote the script, is to be highly commended. The concept of an obsessive/compulsive, self-centered (almost autistic) older guy, set in his ways beyond anything normal finding love is just wondrous strange. And a patient and caring, under-achieving, under-appreciated Manhattan waitress in a house dress, finding not just love but somebody who really knows who she is and what she's worth is also just wonderful.<br /><br /> Wonderful, yes. A wonderful movie to lift the spirit. But As Good As It Gets is more than that. The dialogue is sharp and witty and big-city sophisticated and sometimes laugh out loud funny. The underlying statements about relationships and love in urban America are subtle and thought-provoking. So much is said beside the point. Yes, off to the side we find some street hustlers juxtaposed with someone sensitive, and we see how irrelevant they are and how he overcomes them and this brutal thing they have done to him. And off to the side we see again how irrelevant is the homophobia of a man lost in prejudice and self-hatred, and how it changes when he becomes aware and when he learns to love.<br /><br /> The ancient rule in comedy, from the Greeks to Shakespeare to the musical comedy of the stage to the romantic comedies of the silver screen, has been young and attractive principals overcome obstacles and live happily ever after. Here we have obstacles of the most tiring sort, obstacles not of class or race or family, but of psychological problems, stuff straight out of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders--although to be technical, the symptoms of Melvin Udall are a cornucopia of psychiatric delight. The bitter, cutting, hateful insults that he showers on everyone, even his most devoted admirers, seem more characteristic of Tourette's Syndrome than of a obsessive/compulsive disorder. But never mind. It works. In fact everything works in this movie, from the adorable little dog whom Melvin loves (&quot;A dog...a blanky-blanky dog!&quot; [who has captured his heart] he tells us in amazement), to Greg Kinnear's character's friend (Cuba Gooding) trying to act tough, to Shirley Knight in a bit part as Helen Hunt's character's mother, to the cute little boy with asthma.<br /><br /> However--and this is a big however--this movie is not for everybody, which accounts for some of the nasty reviews below. But ignore them. Trust me. This is a wonderful movie, although perhaps not for those who are homophobic or 13-years-old.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GN8UJIZLCA59.html">A1GN8UJIZLCA59</a><br/><p>Jack Nicholoson gives a tour de force performance as Melvin Udall, a successful novelist who has obsessive compulsion disorder.  Some of Melvin's quirks include washing his hands and throwing away a whole bar of soap after one use (we see his medicine cabinet is packed with bars of soap), he can't step on cracks in the sidewalk or on any floors, uses his own utensils in a restaurant and has to sit in the same booth and order the same meal.  He is also the most insensitive, inconsiderate jerk you could ever meet.  He insults everyone he meets and uses stereotypical comments.  He has a crush on Carol (Helen Hunt), the only waitress in the restaurant that will put up with him.  Carol has problems of her own as her son is constantly sick due to the fact he is allergic to just about everything.  Melvin also has to &quot;put up&quot; with Simon (Greg Kinnear) his neighbor.  Simon is a gay artist and Melvin mercilessly rides him about his sexual orientation and despises his dog, who urinates all over the floor in the hallway.  Simon is beaten up badly and robbed by some thugs and Melvin is drawn into his life as Simon recuperates. Eventually, Melvin, Carol &amp; Simon take a trip from New York to Baltimore so Simon can visit his parents.  The movie gets a little sappy at the end, but the movie is so well acted, you can forgive director James L. Brooks for this.  Mr. Nicholson is at his curmudgeonly best.  He burns up the screen overtime he appears and gives the most comically performance of his career.  Ms. Hunt is both sweet and tough as she keeps pace most of the time with Mr. Nicholson.  Mr. Kinnear gives a breakout performance in his role.  Mr. Nicholson won his third Oscar for the role and Ms. Hunt took home her first.</p></br><a href="../users/A155KXFRZCA7C.html">A155KXFRZCA7C</a><br/><p>If you want to see Jack Nicholson in one of his best performances, showcasing the craft at its best, then you have to see As Good As It Gets. Nicholson plays a grouchy writer with some strange habits ... he's a germ freak. And while the story isn't about anything exceptional, except for &quot;usual&quot; circumstances in life, the characters are highly interesting, especially Nicholson's and Kinnear's characters. It's just a joy to watch great acting in this cute little story, and to relax as you watch this 2+ hour comedy. Helen Hunt is also doing a great job and she fits well into this triangle. You'll enjoy it!</p></br><a href="../users/A41I67QYRAOSQ.html">A41I67QYRAOSQ</a><br/><p>This movie has got just about everything.  Borderline classic.  Jack is an obsessive compulsive guy who tries to overcome so many of his "hang-up" for the sake of a relationship with Helen Hunt.  She realizes this is "As good as it gets", and has to make a choice.  So very many subplots, and contemporary statements made in this movie.  Not only does it make you laugh, but think and feel about your own foibles, and your own views on various topics.  Its very good!</p></br><a href="../users/A5A2QE6NECFR5.html">A5A2QE6NECFR5</a><br/><p>I think Jack, Helen and Greg and the dog have perfect chemistry in this tale of misfits whose relationships, forced at first, turn out to be life-saving for each. Nicholson thrills me here, and while I generally respect his work, he can be a little much in some of his performances. But I identified with him. Kinnear impressed me greatly. At the time this was released, I had not seen him act before. Hunt I knew from "Twister" and "Mad About You" on television, but this role challenged her in many ways, and she pulled it off. Recently I've going through hard times, and so have my three or four closest friends, and we have really needed each other, kind of like these folks on screen need love and friendship. I think this is a film which will gain even more affection and respect from the masses as it ages.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ODBHT4URXVXQ.html">A2ODBHT4URXVXQ</a><br/><p>Somehow Helen Hunt manages to stand up to the power of Jack Nicholson in this role - and I can't think of many other actresses who would have been brave enough to try. But she does, and she does it well.<br />Nicholson is a writer of romance who struggles with OCD and MUST be waited on by Hunt in his neighborhood restaurant; all the other waitresses cower at the possibility of interacting with him, but she smacks him into place, tells him where to get off, and puts his food in front of him. She's got a severely asthmatic son, and when caring for him causes her to miss work, Nicholson steps in as the fairy godfather.<br />But, see, there's a real fairy in this movie: Nicholson gay artist neighbor (Greg Kinnear) who gets bashed up by thugs and loses everything, nearly including his dog, whose trip down the garbage chute is a side-splitting opening scene to the movie.<br />Can't say a lot more without ruining several of the subplots without spoiling it for those who haven't seen it yet. Let's just say that by the end, there's a glimmer of hope that the love (albeit reluctant love) of a good woman just may tame Nicholson's OCD demons.</p></br><a href="../users/A2WSI8HOWHFDOT.html">A2WSI8HOWHFDOT</a><br/><p>During times when it seems like you can't make a comedy without exploiting the handicapped or having bodily fluids fly around (like the Farrelly Brothers movies) or when having intercourse with American Pies is considered witty, and when everything else is a re-hash of the juvenile "Porky's" films of the '80s, "As Good as it Gets" stands out as one better comedies of the last 20 years. It is a genuine attempt to derive humor out of genuine human emotions and situations, and it succeeds most of the time.<p>There are dozens of other reviews here that will tell you the plot, so I won't go over it again. What's worth going over is the job the actors have done. Nicholson, who has basically been playing parodies of himself since "The Shining", actually reveals a human side to his maniacal persona. Helen Hunt is endearing, outraged and hilarious, all at the same time. My favorite moment is when she curses out her HMO. Greg Kinnear's eyes are so full of tears most of the time, that you are urged to throw Kleenex at the screen, yet this makes his more humorous moments all the more funny. But it's Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s moments that make you laugh out loud, especially when he interacts with Nicholson. James Brooks' direction is near flawless. <p>My only reason for holding back the fifth star is that the film really doesn't hold up to repeated viewings. You watch it once or twice, and then you have to put it away for a while. The happy ending is a little too neat, but I guess that should be okay. But my chief complaint is that the DVD version really doesn't offer much more than a few interviews with Brooks and the cast that are mildly amusing, but nothing more than what you would see on E! or Entertainment Tonight.<p>Still, the title of "As Good as it Gets" is very modest. This movie is better than what we usually get.<p>Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points Concluded, A Novel</p></br></body></html>

There are plenty of scenes that will make you jump if you don't know what is coming, but there is a lot of laughs as well. In one word, the movie is fun. Bruce Campbell carries the film since it really does focus on his character and changes Ash from a quiet person into this explosive action hero that you can't help but cheer on! Every time I think of my favorite scenes, the majority of them involve Ash, which is what makes him such a great character. The big scene I immediately think of is when he fights his own hand, you'll just have to watch to see that for yourself.<br /><br />A bigger budget was used in the making of this movie, but some B qualities still can be seen in the movie. Such as you can see there is no roof to the cabin when Ash is trying to out run the deadite spirit following him into the house. Another instance being when the eye pops out of the deadite, you can see the little black piece of plastic making the eye fly. Small things like that do not effect this movie, the story is compelling and you will ignore anything that seems cheesy. There is too much good about the movie and will always win over anything bad that can be said about this movie.<br /><br />People kept asking after watching the first movie, why wasn't Ash every possessed in the first film when all of his friends were? Well, he gets to be possessed in this film in more than one occasion, so it goes to show that even he isn't immune. Overall, this is another MUST SEE! I have watched the movie many times and this is definitely something that will never get old.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N.html">A2UZLIH3BSGJ3N</a><br/><p>No home DVD collection is complete without The Evil Dead II,Dead by Dawn.This is a classic hands down,there has never been another film like it to match its creativity,wits or entertainment value.This film is more of a continuation of The Evil Dead made on a bigger budget and is more or less given a revamping and updated story from the original.Sam Rami's writing and directing are further honed as he steers more away from "scarry" and goes for flat out,falling down,side ripping FUNNY.The perfect melding of "slapstick" Three Stooges humor combined with some good jolts of jumping out of your seat scares and plenty of blood and gore.Bruce Campbell who has had a long time friendship with Rami is truely more gifted than most critics give him credit for.Join Ash at another night in the cabin out in the haunted woods as he fights for his life against the Evil Dead to keep mankind from being swallowed by an ancient evil ressurected by the Necrenomican:Book of the Dead.One by one his girlfriend Linda,Bobby Jo and the rest fall victim to the Evil Dead including his own hand becomming possessed(excellent scene!).This is probably the most perfect of all horror genere films ever made durring the 1980's.Well worth owning a 100 times over and can be enjoyed as much watching multiple times.This film will do more  than just "swallow your soul",it will make you a fan of the "dead" films and what great horror entertainment is really all about.</p></br><a href="../users/A100JCBNALJFAW.html">A100JCBNALJFAW</a><br/><p>this is just as good as the 1st but this one has alot of dark comedy which works very well with this film. they even tried to change the color of the blood too try and escape an NC-17 rating<br /><br />very funny and very dark</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Okay. Granted...most of you are here because you are a fan of this terrific cult classic. But for those that are unfamiliar with this flick, don't make the same mistake that I made almost 20 years ago now when I first thought about renting this at my local video store.<br /><br />The mistake I made was not renting it. It was the title of the movie that scared me away...the word "evil" to be matter of fact. I was sure that it was just one of those poorly acted shock-value festivals of "evil" people, zombies, whatever, doing really mean, torturous things to others. Well, I finally rented it sometime in like 1989 after it was on the shelves for a year, and, boy, was I wrong about thinking that this would be a bad movie.<br /><br />The flick starts out with a guy and his girl heading to a supposedly deserted cabin in a remote forest. And the horror and hilarity then begin. Upon first view, I didn't even realize the deliberate humor that was going on until the infamous hand possesion. Henrietta's appearance then makes for a good scary several minutes, and is then lightened to one of the most humorous moments in horror film history...let's just say it's eye-popping.<br /><br />There are chills and laughs all throughout this classic, even on the second, third, etc viewings. I suggest that you will watch more than once, because, as with me, once you realize this is as much a comedy as it is a horror flick, you will want to look for the jokes that you might have mistaken previously for campyness.<br /><br />A must for any film collector.</p></br><a href="../users/A3IMNZSYDOTTU6.html">A3IMNZSYDOTTU6</a><br/><p>THE EVIL DEAD was a cult hit when it came out on video, thanks to word of mouth and great camera work and special effects. It was also good thanks to the acting kitsch of Bruce Campbell and company, but Campbell made the cut. Now with the idea that another 'Dead' movie would follow, could it match up to the kitsch and scares of the first? You bet!<br /><br />EVIL DEAD 2: Dead By Dawn is ultimately more a campy, funny, and scarier re-make of the first film (although it is a sequel, it's more a reinvisioning of the first film with better elements). It even approaches a sort of "looney tunes" type status with some of its scares, especially the moment where Ash's girlfriend spins out in front with her head popping off and then back on (this is after ash decapitated her and buried her out front).<br /><br />Back to the woods we go, for another round. Ash comes to the cabin (or cottage, whatever you want to call it) with girlfriend Linda (not the same one from the first) for a relaxing getaway, and ultimately finds an device and plays the tape in it and incantations once again summon our evil spirit fiends from the woods. The real beginning of the film is terrific, with the "force" plowing through the woods, the cabin, through the front door and, ultimately, to our hero, possessing him until the rise of the sun. A new group of people decide to visit the cabin themselves, and then the mayhem ultimately proceeds to ensue, with one of the funniest being mother locked in the basement (remember the creepy moments in the basement in the first movie? those are nothing compared to the moments in this one), trying to trick her daughter into letting her out. The best moments of the film come when Ash's hand decides to take on a mind of its own after his hand gets bit by one of the possessed newcomers, and Ash hacks it off and links his hand-less arm to a chainsaw (could that be an homage to Texas Chainsaw? Nah!). This movie has more laughs than the first one does, but it still does have its very creepy moments, with the frenzied camera angles returning; the possessed woods capturing a woman and, near the end, ultimately coming to life to batter the cabin while Ash and one person struggle against the forces in the woods; the big giant scary, but really quite amusing, face that appears in the doorway before being sucked into the portal, which ultimately sucks our hero into another time, leading into the camp ARMY OF DARKNESS, which is by all means a true completion to this ever scary but truly fun trilogy. It, like its predecessor, has a great ending...you will truly appreciate the work Raimi put into this film, with Bruce Campbell (now one of my favorite actors) back in top form with his manic and frenzied performance.<br /><br />DEAD BY DAWN is the ultimate follow-up to a cult favorite, and the third and final installment of the series would very much end the series on a campy note. Would this be the last we hear from our buddies Campbell and Raimi? Definitely not. Was ARMY OF DARKNESS the last EVIL DEAD? Only time will tell. Is EVIL DEAD 2 worth your watch? Absolutely.</p></br><a href="../users/A8DI0COTCMRDV.html">A8DI0COTCMRDV</a><br/><p>Sam Raimi's 2nd installment to the EVIL DEAD series is absolutely out of control! This is truely one of the best horror comedies ever made by far! Simpley because the SCARY parts are very very scary & the FUNNY parts are very very funny & Sam Raimi once again goes nuts with the camera. This is one of my all time favorites!</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKMQFL05Z79K.html">A3GKMQFL05Z79K</a><br/><p>Evil Dead II:Dead By Dawn is the 1987 sequel to the Evil Dead movie made in 1981. The film was directed by Sam Raimi. It starred Bruce Campbell & Sarah Berry. Often looked upon as a remake of the first film on a higher budget, it isn't and wasn't intended to be. The story goes a lil something like this: Ash and his girlfriend Linda take a romantic vacation to a seemingly abandoned cabin in the woods (which is all just basically a recap of the first film minus everyone else to catch viewers up with the plot). While in the cabin, Ash plays a tape of an archeology professor reciting passages from the Necronomicon(or "Book of the Dead"), which he has discovered during an archaeological dig(the professor, that is.). The recorded incantation unleashes an evil force that kills and possesses the body of Linda. Ash is forced to sacrifice his girlfriend. After he buries and dismembers his girlfriend, a spirit is seen on the hunt for Ash. It's there where the film picks up and continues. Alot of people don't know it but this movie might not have been made if it weren't for Author Stephen King. At the time, King was directing his first movie, Maximum Overdrive, based on his short story "Trucks". He had dinner with a crewmember who had been interviewed about the Evil Dead sequel, and the crewmember told King that the film was having trouble attracting funding. Upon hearing this, King, who had written a review of the first film which helped it become an audience favorite, called Dino De Laurentiis and asked him to fund the film. Initially skeptical, De Laurentiis agreed but only alotted Raimi & company $3.6 million as opposed to them wanting $4 million to make the movie. This sequel was originally planned to send Ash back to Medieval times but it was scrapped because of funding. That concept, eventually, became the third movie in the Evil Dead series. Evil Dead II did quite well at the box-office with fans of the original returning to see the further adventures of their favorite hero, Ash. Only this time, it isn't so much a horror movie as it is a 'dark' comedy of sorts with lots of gore. It's further proof that movies of this type can succeed. This Special Edition DVD is packed with plenty of extras. Indeed, it's another classic worth adding to your collection.</p></br><a href="../users/AW4MT9WP95TVD.html">AW4MT9WP95TVD</a><br/><p>Just doing my annual Halloween film-fest and realized I never posted on this one.  It is actually one of my all time favorites.  Campbell is a genius and Rainie does everything right here.  Cheap?  Yes!  Goofy? yes?  Funny?  Oh, yes!  Gorey?  Unbelievably.  Camp horror entertainment at its finest!</p></br><a href="../users/AVCRD98TH48RN.html">AVCRD98TH48RN</a><br/><p>Up until this past year's hilarious "Shaun of the Dead," this film, "Evil Dead II," really had no competition whatsoever for the funniest Horror film ever made.  It would be easy to rave about this Cult Classic filled with trick photography, stop-motion animation, over-the-top gore-soaked casualties, Bruce Campbell's charming chin, and one of the most underrated endings in film history, but I will point out why this particular DVD is exceptional instead.  What makes this DVD rock is that the sound has been digitally remastered into THX surround sound.  The sound-effects in this film are essential to magnify the humor and horror to its great heights.  The other reason to get this DVD is the commentary which includes writer-director Sam Raimi, star Bruce Campbell, co-writer Scott Spiegel, and special make-up effects artist Greg Nicotero.  I swear that listening to these guys self-deprecate and otherwise rip on themselves and the movie is as much fun as watching this film for the very first time.  No kidding.  I was rolling with laughter.  For the quintessential backstory on this film may I recommend Bruce Campbell's thoroughly enjoyable book, "If Chins Could Kill," which is loaded with reminiscences about his time before, during, and after making this landmark Horror film classic.  "Evil Dead II" is a necessary purchase for any Horror film afficionado.  Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D4KCP94ACJZ.html">A34D4KCP94ACJZ</a><br/><p>Allow me to preface this review with a helpful fact.  A few years back when Spin Magazine was writing about the films they felt were the greatest of the 20th century, they chose to include Sam Raimi's sequel to his very first film; which was a small independent horror called The Evil Dead.  The Evil Dead was a great film in it's own right, however, the editors at Spin wanted to give Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn the recognition they felt it deserved.  So they placed it at the top of their list...that's right, they felt that it is, in fact, the single greatest cinematic achievement of the 20th century.<br /><br />Evil Dead 2 follows Ash Williams and his girlfriend into a small creepy Michigan cottage where they stumble upon some recordings that contain readings from an ancient relic called the book of the dead, and by playing these recordings they unleash demonic supernatural forces that quickly haunt and possess everything from the trees outside and Popeye's lamp to Ash's hand and his girlfriend's severed head.  The shenanigans unfold and Ash is more game than perhaps anyone to take on these evil forces as best as he can, but some sort of defeat is consistently inevitable.<br /><br />As a reader I hope you are not anticipating my rebuttal to Spin Magazine here. I just so happen to concur 100% with Spin's gutsy assertion.  On the surface of Evil Dead 2, we are seeing vintage 80s shock horror but it certainly isn't presented deeply enough to qualify amongst the failures within that genre.  Evil Dead 2 is microcosmically structured like classic slapstick and macrocosmically it functions as pure satire.  In this sense it's budget is used firmly to it's advantage and runs together with the theme of making a select audience laugh, first and foremost.  Those who are both distinctly either disturbed by gore or preoccupied by gore as a strength in horror, should take keen note that gore in this film is applied almost exclusively for physical slapstick comedy.  Those who hate gore will hate it here and those who love to be immersed in gore may not understand or appreciate it's use in Evil Dead 2.<br /><br />We get to see a chubby fruit cellar witch's soul-swallowing head extend via shoddy stop-motion effects.  We get to see an eyeball pop out of her head and shoot across the room into some chick's mouth.  We get so see blood spray humorously and pretty consistently out of the walls and floors of the cottage.  We get to see Ash fight his hand, cut it off, and add a chainsaw to where his hand once was.  We get to see him kill his girlfriend and fight both her severed head and headless body in a tool shed at the same time.  We get to see Ash get clumsily chased around the house by a force of evil we never see.  We also get to see the volume of slapstick comedy increase as the film goes on and finally we get to see a conclusion that still makes me kind of wish they never made a sequel (even though Army of Darkness is in and of itself a very good movie).<br /><br />Evil Dead 2 may require a deeper degree of movie history appreciation, perhaps more specifically to exploitation and horror films.  I know I sound like a movie snob saying that but the film does offer some fun and fitting tributes or references to past films.  I think it is definitely fair to say that Raimi has a great appreciation for movies in general and we can plainly see that he has so much fun making them.  Evil Dead 2 for me is fun, affable, and carefree; it is all the things it shouldn't be on it's surface, and it is perfect for that fact alone.</p></br><a href="../users/ANBQIWHO9JRFS.html">ANBQIWHO9JRFS</a><br/><p>Well, we've got a comedy here my friends. Lotsa people like to throw around the term horror-comedy when describing this, but I don't think that's quite appropriate.  While it uses a horror setting, it virtually never seems to be trying to work on a horror movie level, so I'm not really comfortable using the term horror in the description.  On the other hand, calling it a spoof or parody doesn't really decribe it either, as too much of the humor seems to be unrelated to the horror setting.  But, all that aside this is a pretty funny movie, and a rather 'cool' movie as well, for lack of a better term.<p>Unlike everyone else in the world, this is not my favorite of the series.  In fact, it's my least favorite.  However, it still stands up quite well, and is definitely worth your time.  Despite the fact that it shares the setting of the original, this one has far more in common with Army of Darkness then the original, as it focuses on fast-moving and ridiculous comedic setups.  It's largely a means for Campbell to do physical comedy and ham it up amusingly, and showcase lots of intentionally dated, but still cool special effects.  Sadly, Ash isn't quite as amusing as he'd become in the next film.  He's not nearly as angry/surly as he'd become, which I always thought was more important to humor of the film than the physical comedy. But he's still pretty damn amusing.  Raimi's visual flair is as good here as ever.  The 'force' shots are much improved from the already superb ones in the original.  The famed scene of it endlessly chasing Ash around the cabin is especially noteworthy.  He also does some nice stuff with the sky as well, particuarly a great shot of Ash in front of a ridiculously enormous sun.  <p>The film starts off with a simplified recap of the first film, concluding with Ash's burial of Linda and his being assaulted by 'the force'. The briefly possessed Ash is exorcised by the rising sun, but the bridge is still out, and there is no other apparent means of escape, so he is forced to wait it out in the cabin.  The first half of the movie, before the other characters arrive, is the better part.  Most of the stuff involving Linda is quite amusing, particularly her stop-motion animated dancing out in the moonlight.  The best part, however, has to be the scene where Linda's decapitated head attacks Ash.  It's simple, mindless physical comedy, but his frantically running around trying to smash it off is just great. Probably the best scene in the film. I'm also especially found of how the head just spontaneously falls on him from above, without any explanation of how it could've gotten in the cabin, or up above his head, for that matter.  The stuff with his evil and later severed hand is quite amusing too.  The fact that it is inexplicably talking all the time is the real kicker to the whole set-up.  The laughing house scene is quite cool as well, particuarly the disturbing deer head.  It's not really funny or scary or exciting, but it's very, very weird, and works quite well.  <p>The arrival of the other characters hurts the film a bit, partially because I find some of them to be rather annoying.(Most notably Jake, and, to a lesser extent, his girlfried, Bobbie Joe.)  Of course, I think he's meant to be a bit irritating, but that doesn't really make him much more enjoyable to watch.  Fortunately, he's largely redeemed by an extremely amusing death scene.  <p>Despite not being quite as consistent or energetic as the first half, the second half still delivers.  The fight with Evil Ed is a nice sendup of Shelley's death from the first film, and the final confrontation with Henrietta is delightful.(Film makers really need to use stop-motion animation more often these days)  The fight with the rotten apple head isn't quite as good of a climax as I'd have liked, but it's still pretty decent, and does a good job of raising the stakes in terms of sheer ridiculousness.(particularly when Ash plunges his chainsaw into the creatures eye, and it sprays out hideous blue blood)<p>A few closing notes.  First of all, as others have mentioned, although the DVD comes with both widescreen and fullscreen, the widescreen version just appears to have the top and bottom matted. (i.e. you see less in the widescreen version, not more) Since the Anchor Bay release comes with both it's not much of a concern, but it's good to know.  Secondly, this movie has a reputation for being very gory, which is not exactly deserved.  It's just too ridiculous to even be desribed as being gory in the conventional sense, as it generally uses ultra fake blood that isn't even red,(with either incredibly thick or incredibly water texture) and silly, incredibly plastery limbs.(That, and there just isn't all that much gore in it anyway) To say this is very gory is like saying that old Warner Brothers cartoons are very violent. You're technically correct, but you probably give completely the wrong impression to someone who's never seen the piece your talking about.<p>Anyways, this is good. Check it out.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>Okay, I saw the movie on TV. Sadly, It failed (as I said in my AOD review) but that's because all the good stuff was cut out. Then I rented it the movie, and I loved the original uncut version. Truly amazing! A great sequel.<br /><br />STORY: Ash returns to the remote cabin with his girlfriend. The stay at the cabin turns into a nightmare. The next morning, He gets attacked by the unseen evil, and because of that, he unleashes Evil Ash. He tries to escape, but the bridge has been destroyed! Now, his hand goes all bad, which turns him into a one-handed zombie killer, and when people find him in the cabin, they dislike him at first. But when they learn what has happened to them, they must tam up with Ash.<br /><br />OPINION: Awesome sequel! More gore, more excitement, and I love the ending. Waves the atmosphere ready for Army Of Darkness.<br /><br />So go rent this sequel!</p></br><a href="../users/A1TOH8S8I1VT9R.html">A1TOH8S8I1VT9R</a><br/><p>My friends and I have spent a lot of time this Halloween season trying to dig up hidden horror gems for each other.  It's been a fun ride and an expensive diversion for sure.  But as the bewitching hour draws near, it is time to stop digging for a minute and pay proper respects to a film that is so widely loved that this review will simply get washed away with the tide of reviews from its adoring masses.  I give you "Evil Dead II" (imagine trumpets blaring)!!<br /><br />-"TURE HORROR FANS" CAN BITE MY ASH!!<br />Oh yea, I'm coming after you people!!  It's time to open up a can of reality woopak on you!!  Those of you who say a horror/comedy is not horror at all are living in some self-defined fantasy world of limited thinking.  Most people in their right mind will tell you that half the fun of horror movies IS THE FUN!!!  "Evil Dead II" might be the most fun normal people will have while still getting a little bit scared.  So, "true horror fans", you can take your constipated narrow view of horror and drop it in the trash can man.  Sorry for that tantrum.  But honestly, there are so few really good, completely serious horror films that I'd die of boredom watching the same ten films over and over again.  Now that's "true horror".<br /><br />Indiscriminate Spoilers Ahead!!<br /><br />-STAY OUT OF THE CELLAR!!<br />I've seen this film so many times and yet, every time Ash goes into the cellar I get a little creeped out.  So yea, this film is still scary.  It's not so dark with black, shere terror that you'll have trouble going to sleep at night, but it still gets a few chills from me.  In fact, there are many elements in this film that set the standards for creepy camera work.  Sam Raimi was very inventive here.  When you see the camera (evil spirit) chasing after Ash, just think about how difficult that shot was.  Never mind the scene with the trophy animals and the c.lock on the wall laughing at him; way creepy camera angles!!  As creepy as this stuff is, it's all done brilliantly with a light hearted wink from Raimi.<br /><br />-HOLD ON TO YOUR HEADS AND TAKE A BOW.<br />I need to honor the cast for making this one of my all time favorites.  I tend to neglect actor for the most part.  So, here's the role call.<br />-Bruce Campbell = Ash:  Campbell and Raimi clearly have a love for the 3 Stooges and are certainly Moe schmoes.  As the main man, Campbell might have the most expressive face this side of Jim Carrey.  Needless to say, he is great at slapstick and has made being a horror klown, art.<br />-Denise Bixler = Linda:  Next to Ash, Linda is the most memorable role.  Even though she technically dies very early, she spends a lot of time as a head.  Though hardly the queen of B movies, Denise gets huge respect for all the nastiness she endures in this classic.<br />-Ted Raimi = Possessed Henrietta:  His price for nepotism; spending hours in a ridiculous amount of latex!  What a trooper.  This is a pretty darn creepy character too.<br />-Sarah Berry = Annie Knowby: She has the distinct honor of being the last woman in this realm that Ash lusts after.  She gets pretty messy in the worst ways too.  Raimi was just brutal on these people.<br />-Kassie DePaiva = Bobbie Joe:  She's so sweet and helpful in this film.  It also turns out she's a tree hugger, well, they hug her anyway.<br />-Dan Hicks = Jake: Dan gets to be meat.<br />-Rick Domeier = Ed Getley:  Rick gets to be meat too.<br /><br />These people didn't always distinguish themselves but will always have a place in the hearts of "Evil Dead II" fans for making this such a treat.<br /><br />-IF YOU HAVE D' TIME SON, I HAVE D'WIL SON.<br />Well son, or daughter, or "bro" or "sis" or whatever your position in life may be, I suggest that if you haven't seen this film yet then you either don't have the time (so why are you reading this?) or the will.  Get off your butt and watch this all you fans of horror!!  Bruce Campbell is no George C. Scot, man. However, he is quite brilliant in this standard-bearing comedic/horror classic.  You can spend your Halloween all wet while you Bob for apples, and count to 22 or you can watch one of the most entertaining films a true fan of the genre could ever hope for.<br />Sorry J.  I couldn't figure out how to fit a single letter into this mess!!</p></br><a href="../users/A355WMP0CQBJFX.html">A355WMP0CQBJFX</a><br/><p>another one of my favorites, one of the best films out there. evil dead was great, and this sequal was almost just as good. these kinds of movies are the kinds that stand the test of time. they were hilarious and scary then, and not much has changed even now. whether you saw it then or you're a newcomer and saw it now. there are things you'll laugh about, find completely impossible, or just downright think it's stupid, but enjoyable. at the same time you still get those unexpected moments, those shocking scenes, and all that exaggerated blood and gore. wicked movie, but extremely worth every penny. my kind of movie no doubt. the setting is one of the scariest ones. takes place in a creepy old cabin in the middle of nowhere, with nothing but a pich black forest surrounding it. at night it comes alive and the fog swallows everything. this is some good stuff, and let's not forget bruce campbell, got to give the man credit where it's due. he's a great actor and these movies are are a success mainly because of  him. defenitly deserves all the props, and if you haven't seen it yet, you really should.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LZGLA88K0LA0.html">A3LZGLA88K0LA0</a><br/><p>EVIL DEAD 2 isn't so much a sequel but a remake.  Due to copyright restrictions or some other legalese, Sam Raimi wasn't allowed to use footage of the original Evil Dead, so it's almost like Ash is starting all over with his deadly confrontation in the woods.  This time it's only Ash and his girlfriend who stumble upon a deserted cabin and also upon the Book of the Dead.  Four other characters enter the picture, but it's really a tour de force for Bruce Campbell as Ash in this bloody, outrageously comic take off of horror films.  Utilizing excellent hand held camera work and some gross out effects, EVIL DEAD 2 is a non-stop onslaught of gore and comedy.  Watching Campbell battle his own possessed hand is outrageously brilliant, and Raimi's nod to other great directors like Alfred Hitchcock is marvelous.  Note the visuals when the characters eyes move in different directions at the same time, a device Hitch used in the explosive restaurant scene in THE BIRDS.  This is a marvelous cinematic homage to Hitch.  Don't focus on plot holes or cheesy effects where you can see the set crew in the background.  Bask in Campbell's over the top performance and just enjoy one of the most frenetically charged horror comedies of our time.</p></br><a href="../users/A20LY8E9NGYA4M.html">A20LY8E9NGYA4M</a><br/><p>"Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn" is one of the most influential horror sequels of all time. This movie changed the tone of the first movie and became a spoof movie. "Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn" mocks virtually of every cliche of the horror genre. Since this movie gain cult following, other franchises have copied its humorous style, horror franchises like "Child's Play", "A Nightmare On Elm Street" and "Friday The 13th" have shamelessly ripped-off "Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn", just check out "Bride Of Chucky" or "Freddy Vs. Jason".<br /><br />Also recent movies like "Idle Hands" are inspired by the "Evil Dead" series. Obviously, none of those movies is as satisfying as "Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn". The best thing in this movie is the camera work, the camera angles and the editing are so frantic and dynamic that you feel like you are flying in the enchanted woods of the movie. The possessed creatures move as fast as a feline, and are as aggressive as a grizzly bear, and that's really impressive, because these are not your typical flaccid, slow, fragile creatures that usually appear in horror movies.<br /><br />The director Sam Raimi has gained a cult following with the "Evil Dead" series, and now that he became a mainstream director with the "Spider-Man" movies, he has adapted some of his best tricks to those films, check out the camera angles of "Spider-Man" 1 & 2, also the editing is very fast like the kind of editing that he used in "Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn".</p></br><a href="../users/A20DZX38KRBIT8.html">A20DZX38KRBIT8</a><br/><p>The two best horror movies ever are Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2, nuff said!</p></br><a href="../users/AIMR915K4YCN.html">AIMR915K4YCN</a><br/><p>Bruce Campbell returns as Ash, the sole survivor of the first EVIL DEAD demon fest.

Its predecessor was an eerie gorefest designed for one sole purpose: to scare the living hell out of the audience. That said, EVIL DEAD II is a completely different film. In fact, it has much more in common with a Three Stooges sketch than it does with films like THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE or A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.<br /><br />The film opens with a re-hash of the first film: young Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his girlfriend Linda (Denise Bixler) travel to an abandoned cabin in the woods of Michigan. There Ash unwittingly unleashes an evil force which has been lying dormant in the forest - a force which likes to possess human flesh and torment the living. After decapitating his possessed girlfriend with a shovel, Ash struggles to maintain his sanity and ward off the evil force; things become a little more complicated with a group of strangers, led by the daughter of the cabin's original owner (Sarah Berry), wind up fighting for their lives alongside Ash.<br /><br />I was blown away by EVIL DEAD II the first time I watched it. It was after watching it that I came to appreciate just how great a horror film could be. As I've said before, EVIL DEAD II isn't traditional horror. It's horror-tinged slapstick comedy, in the vein of the Three Stooges (of which director/co-writer Sam Raimi and star Bruce Campbell are huge fans). There's some wonderfully over-the-top stuff in this film, thanks to a wacky script by Sam Raimi and Scott Spiegel and some kooky special effects by Mark Shostrom. Joseph LoDuca's score perfectly captures the glumness of Ash's situation, while also capturing the tongue-in-cheek feeling of the film.<br /><br />To me, the greatest point of the film is the camera work. There is some spectacular camera work here: wide shots, distorted close-ups, forty-five degree angles, a point-of-view shot from an eyeball (!). The best camera work in the film occurs through the point-of-view of the evil force (whose form, in a clever move, we never see). The force - and the audience - flies through the forest towards the cabin. It breaks down the door and proceeds to chase Ash through every single room of the house, around winding corners and through doors. It's simply brilliant.<br /><br />While most of the acting is less-than-spectacular, Bruce Campbell's performance is classic. It's no surprise that Campbell is viewed as God by his fans. He is hilarious as Ash, portraying him as a not-so-clever sap with some sharp one-liners. Although Ash (and Campbell) is at his finest in the third EVIL DEAD film - the cult hit ARMY OF DARKNESS - Ash undoubtedly has his moments in this film. Campbell does some wonderful stuff when Ash's hand becomes possessed by the evil. The hand, now with an (evil) mind of its own, decides to torture Ash by smashing kitchenware over his head and making him do some pretty amazing stunts. Finally, in one of the most famous scenes in horror film history, Ash takes care of the hand ...<br /><br />It's no surprise that EVIL DEAD II is the cult legend that it is. It is certainly one of the very finest horror films I've ever seen, and it has been one of my very favorite films since I first saw it. It's a masterpiece, a major improvement over its predecessor. From the fast-paced beginning to the magnificent ending (which sets up the third film), it's a wacky, hilarious ride that no horror fan can miss. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ASIT0JYIGHTA.html">A2ASIT0JYIGHTA</a><br/><p>This is apparently the version Sam Raiimis wanted to make but didnt have the money or the experience at the time, hence Part 1.<br />Part 1 is special because it was a film that almost didnt see the light of day. Filmed in 1979 but not released until 1982.<br />This sequel was made in 1987 and has excellent special effects which make Part 1's effects look very amateurish.<br />Die-hard collectors will want all three of the series.  I can't say I am a huge fan but appreciate the origins of this series.</p></br><a href="../users/A331OF34UX4Y1K.html">A331OF34UX4Y1K</a><br/><p>A true gem, fun to watch. Bruce Campbell's performance is simply astonishing here, nearing perfection !! It's a shame his career didn't develop better after this and ARMY OF DARKNESS. As for the history, plain of fun and great technical qualities for the director.</p></br><a href="../users/A39C7SEMCJWVOI.html">A39C7SEMCJWVOI</a><br/><p>EVIL DEAD 2: DEAD BY DAWN is the highly anticipated sequel to the infamouse cult original THE EVIL DEAD. This film starts out almost as if it will be a remake of the original: Ash and his new girlfriend (?) are driving up to the same cabin in the woods and once again play the tape recording of spells that will summon the dead to possess the living. But this time, Ash takes charge and actually wants to battle the demons that are alway trying to possess him. This film is 50% horror and 50% comedy, and much better made than the original.</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5LA07JCDWTN.html">A2C5LA07JCDWTN</a><br/><p>Basically the premise is exactly the same as the first Evil Dead film.  Ash and his girlfriend go up to spend the weekend at a deserted cabin that contains the book of the dead.  Evil Dead 2 is so much more accomplished in terms of special effects and cinematography.  Some of the shots in this film are nothing less than spectacular (when Ash gets hit by the evil force and gets driven through the forest at 100 mph).  The camera work is amazing and Raimi speeds up the film shots at exactly the right moments (when Ash's hand turns against him).  The ending is simply awesome and leads directly into Army of Darkness.  Evil Dead 2 has everything: lots of gore, some classic Ash lines, superb FX, and top notch cinematography.  Every true horror collector should own this film.</p></br><a href="../users/AE0E6UII0VSZA.html">AE0E6UII0VSZA</a><br/><p>I busted out laughing so many times during &quot;Evil Dead 2&quot; that I was surprised to be scared at certain parts. If the Three Stooges decided to put on hockey masks and make a horror film, this would've been the movie they made. Sam Raimi's spectacular sequel to the infinitely popular cult series that was spawned by his visionary &quot;The Evil Dead&quot; (originally titled &quot;Book of the Dead,&quot; but the producers thought that a literary reference in the title would send prospective viewers astray) is so endlessly funny, violent and action-packed with uncanny sound effects and manic cinematography from Peter Deming (who worked with Wes Craven on &quot;Screams 2 and 3&quot;). It's a never-ending exercise in dark humor and all-out original thinking, and right at its center, a marvelously ordinary hero, Ashley J. Williams, played with amazing physical comic talent by Bruce Campbell, who is apparently the master of flipping himself over.<p>The film starts off as a sort of recap of the events that left Ash alone in the woods during the first &quot;Evil Dead,&quot; with some different adaptations (his other friends in the original were never there, only his girlfriend Linda). Then we're launched headfirst into this hair-raising carnival ride that takes plunges into all-out comedy and then rockets us back up into loops of hellacious scares. The very first brand new scene of the movie is something of a masterpiece as the Evil being in the woods sweeps Ash off his feet and carries him through the treetops. I didn't know whether to think &quot;cool&quot; or start laughing so hard I'd puke, so I did both (didn't puke, though). The new characters are introduced, some are turned into demons, some aren't. All of them reach a grisly demise either at the hands of the demonic forces of the woods, or by the ax of Ash himself, who is always in imminent danger of converting into a member of the Evil Dead fan club himself. As is the usual of films of the horror genre back in the eighties, the acting can be laughably bad at times. Bruce isn't exactly impressive, but he has his moments of believability, and he wears them proudly. But bad acting or not, &quot;Evil Dead 2&quot; is one of the best times a horror film has ever given me. I attribute this to a terrific comic performance from Campbell, the experimental camerawork from Peter Deming, and the kinetic direction from Sam Raimi. This is a movie that will be offering a good time to generations of dedicated film buffs in the years to come.</p></br><a href="../users/A11XKY4EIU2KNR.html">A11XKY4EIU2KNR</a><br/><p>While the first Evil Dead was good, it lacked something, and Army of Darkness (sometimes referred to as Evil Dead III) had the most money, Evil Dead II is a comfortable medium. It has the best black humor of the series and is just cheap enough to work as a lovable &quot;Hey guys let's see what we can do with what we have&quot; movie. This film will always have a special place in my heart. I saw it with my best friend at the time way back in '87 at the theater. We both loved it. Shortly after that, he ran away from home and I never saw him again.<p>For those who love some humor with their horror, this is a perfect film. Bruce Campbell is loved by his fans, and he appreciates what he is. A B-movie actor who loves what he does. Who couldn't like a guy like that. His timing is perfect and as Ash he's a character many can relate too. I mean c'mon who else in Hollywood can play a guy with a possessed hand and beat the crap out of himself.<p>This DVD has an outstanding behind the scenes making that is as entertaining as the film itself. It looks like so much fun, the average Joe would want to pick up his camera and make a movie with his buddies. <p>Though the extras show the tribute to Freddy Krueger in the shed, (right above and center to the door on the inside), his glove appears in one other scene. When Ash is in the celler to get the pages, there's one shot of the door he has to open and go through. On the left Freddy's glove hangs again.<p>ALso no one mentioned it, but when Demon Ash throws the professor's daughter against the wall and is about to kill her, he turns back into normal Ash atthe sight of his dead girlfriend's necklace. Check out the chain before he picks it up. Someone placed it in the shape of a skull.<p>For a frightening good time with the guys, or on the couch with that special girl, you can't go wrong with Evil Dead II. As Ash would say 'Groovy'.</p></br><a href="../users/ATS7LYGLUX34L.html">ATS7LYGLUX34L</a><br/><p>When I first saw Evil Dead II on opening night of it's original theatrical release, I was horrified to see that Director Sam Raimi had turned his back on my beloved horror genre, and made a bizarre splatter-slapstick movie, or what star Bruce<br />"Ash" Campbell would later call "Splatstick". I spent the whole running time fuming over this betrayal. How could the man behind the awesome Evil Dead make this travesty?<p>  Well, with 15 years hindsight under my belt, I am now able to appreciate Evil Dead II for what it is: An over-the-top, out-of-control romp that keeps the blood gushing and the belly laughs coming from start to finish. <p>  After a brief recap of the first Dead flick, we have a new batch of victims come to the cabin to be menaced (along with the leftover Ash...) by the "deadites". Much carnage ensues.....<p>  The effects are great, and it's amazing to see what the filmmakers were able to accomplish with such a limited budget.<br />The extras are a lot of fun, too. The commentary with Campbell & Raimi is hilarious and enlightening, and the featurette, "The Gore The Merrier" is must-see for deadheads. There's also a couple of still galleries, the theatrical trailer, and your choice of Widescreen or full-frame. (Pick widescreen!)<p>  As Ash would say, "Come get some!"</p></br><a href="../users/A3LOBF0ZU1HE0S.html">A3LOBF0ZU1HE0S</a><br/><p>A rather funny and quite grusome sequel that begins straight after the  first Evil Dead that features Ash (Bruce Campbell) battling possesive demon  spirits in a lonely cabin out in the woods. This movie caused a great deal  of confussion when it was released. The audience never knew if it was  supposed to be a sequel or a remake. The answer is that it is a 'sequel'.  The first Evil Dead movie ended with a close-up shoot of Bruce  Campbell  screaming at the camera (the impression was that he was<p>being attacked by  an evil spirit). But the second Evil Dead movie starts off with new footage  of Ash going to a cabin with his girlfriend and the whole thing starts all  over again. They were originally going to use the footage from the first  Evil Dead to use in the beginning of Evil Dead 2 to explain the story, but  they were unable to get the rights for the footage so they had to re-film  the footage to use in the beginning of Evil Dead 2. The DVD edition is  definately a must have for the fans of the series. To start it off it is  THX mastered so the picture quality is a big improvement and it features a  great 5.1 Dolby track. It also comes with a really cool featurette that is  very informative and very funny to watch. The video game preview is also  very cool with its superb graphics, the theatrical trailer is just like any  theatrical trailer and it comes with two commentary tracks. You don't have  to be an Evil Dead fan to enjoy this edition, it can appeal to anyone who  appreciates thrilling action, horror, comedy or just really cool DVDs.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DE1IYJGU5HPW.html">A3DE1IYJGU5HPW</a><br/><p>This review refers to the Limited Edition, the version that comes in the overlarge collector's tin that is too big to fit in any normal DVD case.<p>Anyone considering purchasing the LE ought to know what they are getting into.<p>Evil Dead 2: DBD is a wonderful send-up of the slasher/moster horror genre.  The film's virtues could take up all 1000 words of the review, so suffice to say that Raimi and Campbell made a wonderful piece of work here, especially considering how it was shot and the budget on which it was created.<p>Now, for the dirt on the LE DVD.<p>The metal tin, although cool, is huge.  About three inches taller than a normal DVD case, and about two inches thick, it won't fit in a holder, and will look really out of place next to your other discs.  The cover art is awesome (it was used for the British version of the movie poster, which is re-created on a mini-poster inside, a &quot;poster&quot; roughly the size of a postcard).  The movie and sound transfers are not great, but considering what they had to work with, I think they did the best they could.  The final complaint about the packaging is that the disc itself is in a cheap jewel-case you place in a little niche in the tin.  Sorry, but they could have found a more aesthetically pleasing way to package such an expensive disc.<p>The &quot;Gore the Merrier&quot; feature will appeal mainly to fans interested in how the many creature and blood effects were made.  It runs about a half-hour, and is educational, but more of a &quot;sneak-preview showcase&quot; of making monsters than an actual &quot;how-to class.&quot;<p>The video game preview is a joke; it doesn't show anything you can't download off the web anyway, and the quality is so bad, you feel the urge to squint because it is so fuzzy at times.  Thankfully, game previews usually look nothing like the final products, so there is some hope for this (groovy-looking) Alone-In-The-Dark, Resident Evil clone.<p>The gem of this DVD is the commentary track.  Raimi and Campbell have never disappointed in their commentary on other discs, and they follow up nicely here as well.  I wonder why there wasn't two tracks, as there was on the Army of Darkness LE and the Evil Dead Special Edition, but I'm not going to complain too loudly, as the commentary here is almost worth what they are charging for this disc. (Everything's alright now!)<p>All in all, casual fans might want to stick with the regular edition.  The Limited Edition is pretty much only for collectors.  If you want a copy of this DVD, though, better act quickly, because once they are gone, the price-gougers on eBay will start their work.</p></br><a href="../users/A1BJOEQSRX2IBM.html">A1BJOEQSRX2IBM</a><br/><p>This movie has more scares in it than all the Freddy's and Jason's put toguether,and more laughs than all the Ace Ventura movies.

Fun.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>"Evil Dead II" does not so much strike me as a sequel to "The Evil Dead" but a reworking of the first film.  Director Sam Raimi seems to be more confident in his prowess behind the camera as well as a storyteller.  The horror here is leavened with humor but in no way does it overwhelm it.  This is a horror film.  Bruce Campbell also developes as a performer here.  In the first film he seemed more like a nondescript college kid overwhelmed by the horror that engulfs him.  Here he comes off as not only a believable action hero but as an adept comedian.  His character evolves as the film progresses into a goofy parody of Rambo.  Groovy.</p></br><a href="../users/A3RB6NQOLOBXYD.html">A3RB6NQOLOBXYD</a><br/><p>Honestly I don't seem why most people are upset about this double dip. Anchor Bay only released this dvd once, Twice if you count the Limited Tin edition but thats pretty much the same exact dvd. I could understand if Anchor Bay was releasing another army of darkness or the first evil dead because they have close to 7 different releases of each. Besides the cool art work... for the evil dead 2 book of the dead were getting a DiviMax transfer which it really needed anyway. The Current Evil dead 2 dvd is pretty grainy and needs some work. on top of that we are getting more current and better special features as well. So honestly i don't mind shelling out another 30 bucks to see a cult classic in a new transfer. I bought the original evil dead twice on dvd and it was worth the upgrade, this book of the dead should be eveb better!!!!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A2UW83R0JOZZ6.html">A2UW83R0JOZZ6</a><br/><p>You know there's something seriously wrong when you sit down to a movie that's supposed to be scary and you find yourself laughing to the point of tears. This movie was definetely just that for me when I sat down and  watched it with my friends. I had never heard of Sam Raimi or Bruce  Campbell for that matter, and didn't know what to expect when my brother  pushed play, but as soon as the Necronomicon was opened and the words were  spoken, the laughs began. The talking severed head, the exaggerated terror  of Bruce Campbell and the cheesy special effects had me rolling on the  floor, begging my brother to rewind a scene so I could watch it again. The  laughs don't stop till the end, and I beg the film industry to better rate  and classify their films. This movie is not rated R and it's not horror,  either. It belongs in the comedy section of your local video store, rated  PG-13.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO.html">A1Z1NQJUJQ5CRO</a><br/><p>Evil Dead 2(released March/87)stars Bruce Campbell,back as Ash in this not so much a sequel film,as a remake(on a much better budget) of the first Evil Dead.<br />This film finds our hero Ash back driving down a country road with his ballerina girlfriend Linda.They come upon the self same deserted cottage as in the first film and decide to stay overnight.In the cabin Ash again discovers a tape recorder(same brand too as in the first)and the Necronomicon.This is how we know this is not a sequel because 1)What would he be doing voluntarily back at the cabin again after what happened the first time around and 2)Ash would KNOW what the tape recorder contains and not play it.But Ash does indeed play it,unleashing the terrible force from the Book of the Dead.His girlfriend is possessed and Ash ends up taking her head off in an adjoining shack with a chainsaw.He buries her out front but becomes possessed by the evil himself,which throws him through the woods.This lasts only until daybreak when he jumps in the car and tears away from the cabin.However,like the first film,the bridge is out and he is going nowhere fast.<br />Thrown into this scenario is the professor(on the tape's)daughter and research partner.They are heading to the cabin but find the bridge out on the other side.A tow truck driver and his girlfriend show up and they accompany them to the cabin.Meanwhile,back at the ranch,Ash has his hands full as the evil has taken over much of the inanimate objects in the cabin and there is a couple of minute sequence where Ash laughs madly along with all the objects.Also,because the head of his girlfriend bit him on the hand,the evil took over that hand and he became forced to sever it,again with the handy-dandy chainsaw.When the outside group finally shows up Ash blasts a hole through the door,thinking it's the spirits.The group ends up subduing him and throwing him in the cellar,thinking he killed the professor and his wife.<br />While in the cellar Ash overhears the group talking about the professors wife and how she became possessed and was also thrown into the cellar.Of course in no time the wife indeed shows up,trying to turn Ash into a deadite.Ash makes it out just in time and finally explains the situation.However one by one the group is taken by the evil.First it's the research assistant,then it's the tow truck drivers girlfriend and next is the tow truck driver himself.To dispel the evil the professors daughter reads from the Necronimcon and a giant swirling portal opens up.Ash's car and then Ash himself get sucked into it.Next thing he knows he is plunked down into Medieval times,along with his car.He happens to arrive as a large group of soldiers are trying to kill a flying deadite.Ash takes out(what was to come to be known as)his boomstick,which sends the deadite back to where it came from.The soldiers believe he is the chosen one come back to save them and the film fades out as he screams in despair.<br />Of course the ending will lead into the third and final installment Army of Darkness.Bruce Campbell is in fine form as Ash and he virtually carries the whole movie.The co stars are mere window dressing,but watch for a cameo by director Sam's little brother Ted as the professors dead wife.This was definitely Evil Dead on a better budget as the film stock is better(35mm this time and widescreen),the S/Fx are better and Jo LoDuca is on hand to score the music;well known for his superb works in Hercules and Xena.<br />Technically speaking both the full frame and original widescreen version are presented here.Both picture and sound(in THX)have been remastered and the picture never looked better.Extras include audio commentary,still galleries,bios,the trailer and a featurette on the films making.The DVD is a one sided disc.<br />All in all a recommended film.It's Evil Dead on a better budget and will please all fans of the series.It's not a GREAT film per se',but it is satisfying none the less.It has a few scare the pants off you moments,along with some funny turns by the Campbell-meister.</p></br><a href="../users/A1W702WG1LC6R3.html">A1W702WG1LC6R3</a><br/><p>Bruce Campbell stars in Sam Raimi's 1987 horror sequel.<br />A man and a group of people are trapped in a cabin<br />fighting demonic possession.

Up loud, this film is potentially very scarey, and whilst I had obviously noticed the comedic  elements, I had never considered that the comedy might be the raison detre of the film; overall, I still think that the Horror-Comedy tag is correct, since most good Horror films need to be paced, otherwise the film just fails to scare.<br />The commentary is very revealing. Whilst I have continually enjoyed multiple viewings, I had never noticed the sneak references to other horror icons that the commentary refers  to in the special  feature.<br />Whilst the Special "Book" edition I am referring to in this review is about the unrated  edition, it appears some edited editions, may skip certain items ( like the British Edition).<br />The Commentary is brilliant, and reveals a great deal, and shows just how much fun the group had in creating this work. I can but wonder if Ted Raimi is perpetually thin thanks to this film, or in spite of it :-).<br />However you see this film, its a great work, and shows plenty of Sam Raimi's style, and Bruce's agility.<br />ENJOY.<br />********************<br /><br />After watching the film again for the umpteenth time, and hearing the commentary, as well as seeing the "Making of..."  feature, it is just proof positive that a film by Sam Raimi is great despite faults.<br />It seems like Sam can run on the sniff of on oily rag, as far as motivation goes, and wow how that takes him a LONG  way.<br />After doing so much with so little, it is not a surprise that with a larger budget, Raimi can do wonders.<br />Anyways, check out the making of feature, as well as the commentary... the extras make this a gem on DVD.<br />This film is great on VHS, but wow is it an awesome gem in this special  edition package.</p></br><a href="../users/A3LOBF0ZU1HE0S.html">A3LOBF0ZU1HE0S</a><br/><p>The sole survivor of the first massacre in the cabin returns with his girlfriend, and the whole thing starts all over again. This time there is quite a bit chainsaw mutilations and wise cracks from the cast. Just about  as much gore as the first, but no nearly as original. Shocking ending.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Sam Raimi<br /><br />Cast:  Bruce Campbell, Sarah Berry, Dan Hicks, Kassie DePaiva, Ted Raimi, Denise Bixler, Richard Domeier, John Peaks, Lou Hancock.<br /><br />Running Time:  85 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for extreme violence, language, and nudity.<br /><br />Our hero Ash returns in this 1987 blood bath of a follow-up to "The Evil Dead". The king of slapstick horror does a bang up job of combining laughs and plenty of gore to create one of the most memorable and beloved horror sequels of all time. What some people may or may not know is, the movie, intended to be a sequel, was actually a revisited version of the first film. In this version, Ash (Bruce Campbell) returns to the dreaded cabin in the woods with only his girlfriend Linda (Denise Bixler) and his infamous Oldsmobile. What was meant to be a quiet, relaxing get-a-way in the woods suddenly explodes into a bloody night of survival when Ash is forced to do battle with the evil that lies within the woods. Possessed trees, zombie mothers, and one demonic hand all set the stage for Ash as he risks life and limb (literally) to make it through the night. Joined later by Annie Knowby (Sarah Berry), the daughter of Professor Raymond Knowby (the man who unlocked the mysteries of the book of the dead), Ed Getly, (Richard Domeier), and two wanderers Bobby Joe (Kassie Depaiva) and Jake (Dan Hicks) Ash and his crew must survive the night, or be dead by dawn.<br /><br />Despite that fact that Sam Raimi is now a "proper" director making summer blockbusters like his life depended on it, it is still heartening to see that his frenzied style is still present in his work, albeit it not dealing with such extreme material as that which made his name famous decades ago. While Evil Dead II may be a complete repeat of Evil Dead in terms of the basic narrative and content, it is still worth seeing because of Raimi's skill as director and writer of the film.  Horror fans may find it a little tame by modern standards although I still found it to be pretty scary and gory - certainly considering it was made almost 20 years ago with a budget that would barely buy you an A-listed movie star these days. The film is also pretty funny and is full of dark humor and comic moments that make it more entertaining than a gory b-movie has any right being. But here's the thing, the success of this film and indeed the whole trilogy, is mainly due to two people - Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell. Raimi drives everything with his unique direction that places the action somewhere between a horror and a cartoon. It has great camera work, frantic shots and a real flair for the unreal; it is very hard to describe but it can be seen it many of his films.<br /><br />Campbell's ongoing cult status has only been helped recently by Bubba Ho-tep but this is where it basically began and part II only sees his continue his good work as Ash becomes more of a hero than he was in the first film. He still has the cowardly quality that I loved in Ash but now has weapons and kiss-off lines to compliment his new status. As before his performance perfectly matches Raimi's direction and I can totally understand why the two have kept their close relationship decades later; they really seem to "get" each other here. Support from Berry, Hicks, DePaiva, Domeier and Bixler is just about passable for this type of b-movie stuff but really the cast is dominated by Campbell playing his best character to date.  Overall, this is a gory, cheap horror movie that won't appeal to everybody but to those that get it, it will be a hugely enjoyable, gory film with a great sense of humor. Director Raimi and actor Campbell truly makes the film work better than the material would suggest it should and, on the basis of any of the three films, it is no wonder that this is such a timeless cult horror.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn (Sam Raimi, 1987)<br /><br />Dead By Dawn is one of those films that makes you ask the question "remake or sequel?" over and over again while you're watching it. Raimi has changed the rules a bit from the first film in this one, but kept Ash, leading to the viewer's almost constant confusion.<br /><br />In this episode, Ash and his girlfriend Linda (Denise Bixler) head up to the cabin that everyone (except, it seems, Ash) remembers from the original film. Ash discovers the book and the tape player, which again, everyone (except, it seems, Ash) will remember, and does exactly what he shouldn't do. With the expected consequences.<br /><br />Intercut with this are scenes of Annie (Sarah Berry, who would later surface in the lovely CHUD II), the daughter of the guy reading the passages aloud on the tape, who has a vapid boyfriend, a need to get to the cabin, and the other pages of the book, which (conveniently) contain the spell to send the evil back where it came from. Of course, we end up with everyone at the cabin, waiting to become zombie food.<br /><br />Dead By Dawn is by far the weakest of the three Evil Dead movies, but it's got its own charm; it's kind of The Evil Dead Meet the Three Stooges. It alternates between awful and hysterical. And it didn't have to be awful; it was immediately obvious from the first half-hour of The Evil Dead that Sam Raimi knew a camera lens from a plate of spaghetti, but either a good deal of the comedy here falls flat, or Raimi did portions of this film as a rush job (a quick skim of the list of goofs at IMDB gives the latter impression). It's also, obviously, meant as (perhaps its primary reason for being was) setup for Army of Darkness, a far superior film, and it has a great deal of archival value based on that. But as a standalone film, it's not all that great. ** ?</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>Immediately, when you pop in this DVD, it gives you the choice of Widescreen or Full-Screen, Followed by the statement, "Warning: This Film Contains Scenes Which May Be Too Intense For Persons Under The Age Of Seventeen".  Bruce Campbell (NBC serial, "Generations", in 1989) returns four years later in this sequel to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005R24K">The Evil Dead</a> (1983).  Ashley brings a girlfriend up to the cabin where he was terrorized before.  Something happens.  Ashley plays the reel to reel player with spell on it.  The evil force is released.  Girl taken through window.  Ashley finds her possessed.  Girl killed and buried.  Then the evil spirit gets a hold of Ashley, temporarily.  He gets back into the yellow car only to find the Dangerous Bridge has been totally destroyed.  The evil spirit won't allow him to leave and chases him back into the cabin and into the cellar.  meanwhile, there are other people who have flown in just to get to the cabin.  The tow truck man knows another road.  Ashley is now fighting with the evil spirit and with his own possessed right hand.  Plays like a "drive-in" film and uses special effects we have seen in "7th Voyage of Sinbad" and "Basket Case"  Studio must have been given him an extra $100 for the budget  this time.<br /> Followed by: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0783227434">Army of Darkness</a> (1993).</p></br><a href="../users/A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q.html">A1M4NJYP0WNL8Q</a><br/><p>I realize that it is very fashionable to love really bad films just for the love of their badness.  And Dead By Dawn is the worst kind of badness -- a totally awful sequel to a film that was a parody of the totally awful films I grew up with.  It is a film where one can actually see the actors suddenly realize that they are acting too well and, with a jerk, dumb everything down even more.  At some point one has to wonder whether Sam Raimi is making fun of the whole genre, just scream films, or me.  The latter, I suspect.  And everyone else who goes through contortions explaining why really bad films are actually 'cool.'<br /><br />Standard hokey plot - one after another a group of people are drawn to the cabin of an archeologist working on a translation of the Necronomicon.  Lovecraft turns over in his grave.  A section is read and draws the attention of an ancient evil.  Soon people are being possessed, the dead rise, and parts mix with axes and chainsaws in an ever-growing chaotic pile.<br /><br />Every effect is studiously arranged to ring a bit false.  While there are spectaular makeup jobs, the effect is intentionally comic.  But the comedy, the sight gags, the windows that are perpetually broken and then boarded up again, and the tiny cabin with it's infinity of rooms really don't hold the film together, any more than they would a burlesque show.  This is a film designed for intermittent attention.  Any 10 minutes tells you exactly the same thing as every other 10 minutes.<br /><br />As a result I kept staring at the cabin's clocks with the 'dead by dawn' refrain repeating in my mind, hoping against hope for a glimpse of sunrise.  As much popularity as this film enjoys, it never made it over my own bar, and I'm not really all that much of a snob.  But each viewer should decide for him or herself.  It is entertainment, after all, with all the comfort of the horrible made less so by our ability to laugh at it.</p></br><a href="../users/A319SKSB556033.html">A319SKSB556033</a><br/><p>Just for the record, this is not a remake, but a sequel. Sam Raimi could not get the rights to re-use scenes from Evil Dead so he re-shot some of them to explain what is going on and how Ash and Linda got to the cabin. But there still is a major sense of deja vu.<br /><br />Ash barricades himself into the cabin after the events in the first film and finds himself going crazy. The furniture starts laughing at him, his reflection talks to him and an evil force is determined to take him over. It manages to possess his hand and so he cuts it off. It starts scuttling around the floor on its own and randomly attacking him. Strangers show up in the hope of finding the Professor, who was staying there, and lock Ash in the cellar. They assume he is responsible for the bloody carnage.<br /><br />People die, people turn into monsters - same old same-old. It's hard to imagine why this is such a cult favorite when it is obviously a badly made movie. Or perhaps Raimi just works the best he can with a low budget (although many times higher than the original) and the shoddy production values are a result of that.<br /><br />He goes over the same ground he did before, except with more resources for gore and mayhem. Very little of this makes sense and none of it is scary. There are a couple of good moments, like when Ash's hand beats him up and when he is chased through the house by the unseen evil force. Campbell is a terrific physical actor and he is a delight to watch, but I doubt whether he understood what on earth he was doing, or why.<br /><br />Having a low budget does not excuse a bad storyline and although this looks more professional than Evil Dead, it still looks like a student film. The best part is the cliff-hanger ending that leads to Army Of Darkness.<br /><br />The DVD comes in a great package, is in Dolby 5.1 and is anamorphically enhanced at 1.85:1.</p></br><a href="../users/AIIR8E34EDKCQ.html">AIIR8E34EDKCQ</a><br/><p>If you liked the first Evil Dead movie then this will be a nice refresher of some very similar scenarios. After seemingly escaping with his life intact, Ash is back in a cabin! I tell you that boy has no common sense but without his poor judgment who else would release demons back onto our domain? So back in the cabin - check, new girlfriend - check, recycled gift given ( necklace) to new girlfriend since the last one died - check, demon book in cabin - check, tape recorder with the words needed to release the evil - check...we are back in business! Ash gets back to doing what he knows best - unleashing havoc into the world of the living. One would think that he has joined some wicked book of the month club, where the books end up getting people killed as he's always finding them. Best part is that the action starts right of the bat, there is no sitting around waiting to be attacked and when few more people get stranded in the cabin the real fun begins.<br /><br />This movie was insane, I mean bug out crazy! All the things you think you'd do in your wildest dreams come to life - horror style. Not only is Ash running in circles from the menacing evil, but his own body turns on him and starts to betray him, leaning towards the dark side. Best part was the puppets again, there were some gooey gross faces from the demonic possession due to the transformation and sometimes I didn't know whether to laugh or just watch in disbelief.<br /><br />This movie felt very short in comparison but the ending was fantastic, it really sets you up for a grand finale that I can't wait to watch.<br /><br />- Kasia S.</p></br><a href="../users/A3NQI2JLNPFOF8.html">A3NQI2JLNPFOF8</a><br/><p>.....the 'comedy' element is almost nonexistent to a young mind.  With that said, Evil Dead 2 scared the hell out of me.  Seeing it again, however, I can appreciate the humor in the film.  Also, I'd have to say the scene where Bruce Campbell fights himself is probably one of the greatest acting achievements of all time and my man should be given a Oscar for it.  It's something that you can watch over and over.  How about that laughing moose head?  Or Ash bending his knees in synch with the 'evil-possessed lamp'?  Anyone that doesn't outright fall in love with this movie has no business watching movies in the first place.  Am I wrong?</p></br><a href="../users/A1F1FOR46702YF.html">A1F1FOR46702YF</a><br/><p>Evil runs wild in the exciting comedy-horror favorite "Evil Dead: Dead by Dawn". In the deep woods, a traveler named Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his girlfriend Linda find an abandoned cabin and accidentally unleashes an unspeakable evil force from the pages of the Necronomicon, the ancient Book of the Dead. Now, Ash must resist this strange evil's brutal torments in order to save his soul and send the evil force back to where it came from. Director Sam Raimi's (Spider-Man 1 & 2) horror spectacle is an amazing combination of creepy stylish horror and hilarious slapstick comedy. "Evil Dead 2" is more of a big budget remake of the original "Evil Dead" (1982) than a sequel. Its storyline progresses smoothly and offers some good scares and very entertaining moments. The cult favorite contains some terrific camerawork, effective visuals effects, immense laughs and memorable gross-out scenes. Bruce Campbell's vivid performance as unlikely hero Ash is another good highlight of the 1987 film.<br /><br />For fans of the horror genre, "Evil Dead II" is a highly recommended purchase. The cult 1987 favorite is presented in both standard full screen and 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen formats. Its picture quality is reasonably sharp with good contrast. Its Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is rather enjoyable with lively surround effects. This DVD contains a detailed audio commentary with filmmaker Sam Raimi, star Bruce Campbell and production crew, the amusing 30-minute "The Gore the Merrier" behind-the-scenes documentary, still galleries, original theatrical trailer and a short preview of "Evil Dead: Hail to the King" video game. The animated menus are excellent. Overall, "Evil Dead II" scores a surprising "B+".</p></br><a href="../users/A2E9TRM8096BXU.html">A2E9TRM8096BXU</a><br/><p>This has to be the strangest film ever made. A horror film that is not the least bit scary, it somehow remains one of my favorites of all time. Fuse "the Three Stooges" with "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and you have "Evil Dead 2," the cult classic from Sam "the Detroit Maverick" Raimi, which is nothing more than a blur of campy dialogue, blood-splatterings and whiplash steadicam shots that will have your head spinning. Don't be fooled by the title: this is not a sequel to the low-low budget "Evil Dead." It is a higher-budget remake, with all pretense of horror abandoned in favor of outrageous campiness and the most ridiculoulsy funny violence ever filmed (a demon keeps threatening to "swallow your soul"....the hero chops its head off with an axe....the demon keeps threatening him....hero produces double-barreled shotgun, quips "Swallow this" and blows the talking head to bits). Essentially, "2" is about some witless kids who take up in a cabin deep in the remote forest, and unwittingly (get it?) unleash blood-thirsty, hyperkinetic demons when they read from a cursed spellbook. Sound familiar? Of course it does. You know, for instance, the demons are going to feast on the kids at will, whittling them away with cat-and-mouse games, until just one or two are left....however, it is at this point that Evil Dead departs from every other horror flick you've ever seen. Hero Ash (Bruce Campbell, B-movie God and durable victim of physical stunts aplenty) isn't content to just sit by and be terrified. Oh, no. Instead of playing the scream-and-run role so familiar in slasher movies, Ash goes loco on the demons arses, and with axe, shotgun and chainsaw proceeds to do to them what they so rashly tried to do to him. And boy, does he ever whoop some tail. Picture if one of the victims in the "Friday the 13th" series had flipped his lid, and instead of cowering under the bed, gotten up inflicted a New York Housing Authority ...whipping on Jason halfway through the movie, beating him like a red-headed stepchild and then plunging a sharp instrument through his guts. Now picture that for 85 minutes. That's "Evil Dead 2." A classic.</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>Evil Dead 2 is by far the best of the trilogy, and its the comedy of the movie that makes it so.  The first Evil Dead was a straight forward horror movie that was loaded with gore galore.  Evil Dead 2 is really a remake of the original with better effects, better acting, and somewhat better story.  There isn't as much gore as there is in the original, but the blood flows and flies everywhere, sometimes with hilarious results.  When Ash's hand takes a mind of its' own is one of the funniest segments I've ever seen in a movie, and naturally Bruce Campbell is perfect as the hapless hero.  Do yourself a favor, even if you don't like horror movies pick up the entire Evil Dead trilogy, you'll be laughing out loud while you cringe in disgust.  Also highly recommended is Bad Taste.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TJIJKKN15KR9.html">A1TJIJKKN15KR9</a><br/><p>What points this loses in coherence and structure it immediately makes right back with energy, ingenuity and downright entertainment value. Little more than a one man show, Evil Dead 2 is where Bruce Campbell really made his name, and deservedly so. Whether he's shrieking like a little girl at the sight of a poorly-animated headless marionette, cackling deviously as he nails down his own evil right hand or playing it cool as the gritty, badass soldier-man with a chainsaw appendage, Campbell boldly plants his flag right in the center of every scene. I can't begin to imagine the kind of fun he and director Sam Raimi must have had cooking up one outlandish, unbelievable situation after the other, then playing it up on-screen to this degree. It's a film you'll never quite nail down - is it meant to be serious or slapstick - and that's precisely why it works so well. A load of fun that escalates faster than you can blink.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PASRZ81DY9C.html">A1PASRZ81DY9C</a><br/><p>Viewed: 10/04, 9/06<br />Rate: 9<br /><br />9/06: A far much better picture than the original, Evil Dead 2 oozes a lot of special effects, taking what was done in The Evil Dead and making it to be the primary focus for its sequel. Not only that the special effects get a lot of attention, it's the horror type found in Evil Dead 2 to be very appealing. The acting, again, is improved over also in Evil Dead 2. I consider Evil Dead 2 to be a remake and part of a sequel, in a very mild way, of The Evil Dead. Moreover, the story found in Evil Dead 2 is very good and much more campy than the first picture. Sam Raimi has allowed himself to shoot a very genuine horror picture with great amount of special effects. At first time I saw this picture, I thought it was a bore, but seeing it again, my opinion have changed. I've come to respect Evil Dead 2 and its prequel to be finest in horror genre. I couldn't think of a better independent horror picture in the same kind as Evil Dead 2. It's also amazing what I was seeing in Evil Dead 2 was done in absence of computer graphics commonly found in today pictures. All in all, Evil Dead 2 is a well done picture that deserves a lot of credit. By the way, notice that Bruce Campbell bears an eerily resemblance to Jim Carrey.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>Whether it's a sequel or a remake, it doesn't matter once the film starts. This is the second installment in Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series, and it's one of the few sequels (or "remake" if you want to call that) that is equal to the original. It's just as diabolical, with some twisted moments that will no doubt be implanted in the brains of those who watch them. I think the only difference here is that the black humor is more constant than in the original. There is one scene in which Ash (Bruce Campbell) discovers that his hand is possessed by an evil spirit, and from then on, some diabolical hilarity ensues. The entire film is basically a perfect mix of horror, blood, slapstick, gore, and over-the-top edginess. It's actually one of the better horror films in recent decades. Sure, it may not be like The Exorcist, The Shining, or George A. Romero's zombie films, but the entire Evil Dead series stands on its own as a scary & darkly hilarious bloodfest. Kudos to Raimi and Campbell.</p></br><a href="../users/A25CMSI6S7S63C.html">A25CMSI6S7S63C</a><br/><p>This is a very entertaining zombie movie. Horror,scares that are blended with great funny moments make for one great movies. Bruce Campbell stars as Ash - his status become legendary after this, now he is a major horror icon and always gets roles in TV shows, and appears in Spiderman movies since his buddy Sam Raimi is the director. Sort of a remake of the first Evil Dead...the dead come to life after reading passages to the Necronomicon. The effects,action,horror and suspense are just all stupendous and the gore was really aplenty in this movie. You will laugh, scream & just have a great time watching this.A good scene to watch for is Ash (Campbell) fighting his own hand and watch out for flying eyeball (GULP)<br />I know there have been plenty of releases on DVD of it as usual with Anchor Bay milking it for all its worth. I have the tin of it and I am keeping it - no matter how many re-releases. I like the tin and I am happy with all the bonus features included (commentaries,etc). In most cases all the re-releases have the same features anyway.<br />Great film and worth owning no matter what release you choose.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>This is one of the few horror movies I truly enjoyed, because the film offers a great combination of horror and comedy. It adds up to a very entertaining 85 minutes.<br /><br />There's a lot to like in this kinda-goofy movie: nice visuals; good humor to counteract the scariness and gore of a horror story and some totally outrageous scenes. They include a woman's head loose and then biting a man's hand with the rest of her body running around with a chainsaw; a hand with a mind of it's own, monster-type grandma and grandpa in the cellar, chase scenes through a forest with trees coming to life and attacking people, on and on....wild, wild stuff.<br /><br />My main complaint is that there are not enough lulls. There is too much action, and it's so intense it's almost too much to watch in one continuous sitting even with its fairly short length. One needs a break once in a while!<br /><br />Whatever,  I think most of this is played for laughs more than horror. Bruce Campbell suffers physical damage that would have killed a person many times over but within seconds, he's back to normal. Campbell, by the way, must have set the all-time record for making wild faces in a movie, more than Jim Carrey. However, this movie certainly isn't one to be scrutinized for realism. You have to look at it, with all the gory scenes and shocking violence, as mainly a tongue-in-cheek satire on horror movies. At least that's the way I saw it.<br /><br />Now that's out on Blu-Ray, I have to check it out again.</p></br><a href="../users/A16XRPF40679KG.html">A16XRPF40679KG</a><br/><p>This is one of the best horror movies of the 1980's.  That being said starz could have done a better job cleaning up the grainy picture.  It is still a improvement over the standard dvd release though.  Therefore it is a welcome addition to my collection. However I am going to email starz and ask them why at the more expensive prices of blu ray that they don't treat each release like a special edition.  After all few of us are going to replace this version with a new blu ray version that costs 40.00 just to get deleted scenes.  At this price all blu rays should be treated as special editions and deliver any deleted scenes that such a edition would have.  Starz is not the only company doing this either.  So it is worth the effort to email any studio and say that if you expect us to pay these higher prices, then we should expect it to be released  like a special edition.</p></br></body></html>

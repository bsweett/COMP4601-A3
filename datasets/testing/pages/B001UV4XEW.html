Once I got the chance to watch it I thought it was stupid. Husband wanted this movie. So we bought it. I watched it yesterday and I found it funny. I think when I first saw it I didn't expect it to be stupid funny and that is why I didn't like it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2H1WNB30JNAWU.html">A2H1WNB30JNAWU</a><br/><p>I have to say this movie was very funny to me. They got very carried away on the movie, but I enjoy all the crude humor, slapstick comedy moments, and a few moments were I thought this could happen to anyone.  Plus their were a few scenes that made my gut and ribs hurt like crazy from laughing so hard.  So if you need a good comedy movie with over the top gags and humor then pick this DVD up and keep the laughs going all night long while hanging with friends or just having an eveing of unwinding with drinks and whatever else you desire for the night.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P98DMX8YUSNW.html">A1P98DMX8YUSNW</a><br/><p>Normally, I never laugh at so-called 'comedies," because I rarely find them anything but forced or imbecilic. This one was no exception. I may have laughed once toward the end, but I still found this entertaining enough to merit four stars. Yes, it's basically a gross-out fest, a kind of frat house film, only with all the four main characters in their early 30s or so. But the writing was better than most of those, and the acting was really the high point. These four guys can act. The plot is somewhat original. They get so drunk and high in Vegas, they can't remember the previous night, so the whole thing is a reconstruction of their hijinks. There are no weak moments.</p></br><a href="../users/A1K3NQAO49LXL2.html">A1K3NQAO49LXL2</a><br/><p>A well-put together but absurd comedy about a wacky Wolf Pack, out for fun at a best friend's bachelor party. A great cameo by Michael Tyson is welcome, but the film is not as side-splittingly funny as it is awkward and uncomfortable; for truly side-splittingly funny (as well as some good scene stealing, and even some real character development), you need to look no further than the female version of The Hangover, which is called Bridesmaids. Of course, us guys can't admit that to other guys ("Huh? You thought a film called `Bridesmaids' was funnier than `The Hangover', which all of us have lived in our lives and can totally relate to? I haven't even heard of that film, much less seen it"), but it's actually true. The "oh-I-get-it-now" moment at the end is pure Scooby Doo, and the "henpecked boyfriend finally figures out that his girlfriend is a bitch" cliche resolution at the end is a bit superfluous. But don't get me wrong - the "Wolf Pack" speech alone is worth the price of admission, both for its surrealness as well as its twee naivete, as are the early scenes when Zach Galifianakis is introduced as the goofy brother-in-law. Good one, guys.<br /><br />Gettin' ready for deja vu with the sequel...</p></br><a href="../users/A3R8PXSFGY9MC2.html">A3R8PXSFGY9MC2</a><br/><p>`The Hangover' is a goofy comedy about a stag night in Las Vegas that goes horribly wrong when the stags wake up in the morning with a tiger in the bathroom (!), absolutely no recollection of the night before and a missing groom. The film quickly descends into frantic farce as they try to retrace their steps and find the lost groom before it is too late. The actor who plays Andy (Zach Galifianakis) is particularly good and makes this film a whole lot funnier and the other actors manage to keep things speeding along whilst raising laughs at regular intervals. This has a real `old school' vibe about it and reminded me of various comedies from the 80's and if you enjoyed the off-the-wall comedies from that era then this will be right up your street. There are plenty of cliches and obvious jokes but they are delivered so well you can't help but laugh despite yourself. You even get a cameo appearance from Mike Tyson who is pretty funny as well. The various elements the stags have to track down and uncover to find the groom keep the story interesting and make you want to keep watching to find out how various things occurred and how they lead to the groom; like a funny detective story. This is a film that doesn't try to take itself too seriously and sets out to deliver some laughs by the time the film ends and whilst it isn't ground shaking or the best comedy I have ever seen, it does achieve it's goal and had me chuckling at points throughout.

But it's the unique and vivid style in which it's delivered to us, that makes The Hangover not only the funniest comedy of 2009, but also the best comedy of the last few years.<br /><br />Going in, I expected it to be exactly what it could have very easily been: the movie described in the previous paragraph. However, we don't even see the bachelor party.<br /><br />The film opens with Phil (Bradley Cooper) and his two pals on the side of the road in the desert. Between them they have a busted lip, a missing tooth, a hospital bracelet and filthy clothes. Phil makes a dreadful phone call informing a would-be bride, that they are unable to locate her groom. When she reminds him that they are to be married in a few short hours, he apathetically replies, "Yeah... that's not gonna happen."<br /><br />We jump back to before they left for Vegas and meet the characters. Phil is a school teacher who sees nothing wrong with lying to the kids about a made-up field trip, and using the money they hand over, to fund the bachelor party. Stu (Ed Helms) is a dentist who calls himself a doctor, and has his entire life ran for him by his moody and severely overly strict girlfriend. Alan (Zach Galifianakis) is beyond strange and is only invited to come along as a favor to the bride, as he is her brother. And we meet Doug (the groom), played by Justin Bartha.<br /><br />We follow them on the road to Vegas, where they check into an insanely expensive room and everything seems to be going a-ok. Then they toast to the first drink and... wake up the next day, seriously hung-over and used and abused by God knows what happened. When Stu asks "Why can't we remember anything from last night?"; Phil delivers one of my favorite lines in the film by responding, "Obviously because we had a great f***ing time."<br /><br />The room is absolutely destroyed; a bowling ball stuck in the middle of the wall, a tiger in the bathroom, and a chicken walking around aimlessly. Oh, and did I mention the infant they find in the closet? And of course, Doug is no-where to be found.<br /><br />From there they begin to use what little clues they have, to help point them in the right direction as to where Doug might be. It's wildly entertaining and devilishly funny. The movie never misses a laugh or skips a beat. Having recently seen The Hangover for a second time; I can tell you it only gets funnier with additional viewings.<br /><br />The amazing Todd Phillips directs this comedic masterpiece as brilliantly as he has done with his treasures of the past, to include: Road Trip, Old School, Starsky & Hutch and School for Scoundrels. There is an excellent soundtrack, and the cinematography is top-notch, to boot.<br /><br />The film is dirty at times but it is never tasteless or witless. It's beautifully and cleverly written and contains at least a dozen one-liners that will live on forever. It may have several clich&eacute; elements found in numerous similar films of this genre, but it does marvelous things with them.<br /><br />For instance: the scene where Doug is given the keys to his future father-in-law's prized car, to take to Vegas. You know it's gonna be all smashed to hell or blown up by the end of the movie, but what they do with it here was genius. Or how about the fact that Stu lied to his insane girlfriend about going to Vegas. Think she might find out? Who cares - everything ties together all the way from the first act to the third, and we appreciate the effort the writers put forth. If they are half as talented at writing action / sci-fi as they are at comedy, Michael Bay should hire them for the third Transformers film.<br /><br />The casting was perfected to a T. Everyone nails their character dead-on. Bradley Cooper is sincere as a guy who just wants to have a good time and can keep his cool when things don't go as planned. Ed Helms makes an excellent worrier when nothing goes as planned. And Zach Galifianakis was born to be the guy to cause everything to not go as planned.<br /><br />The Hangover will undoubtedly do for Galifianakis' career, what Tommy Boy did for Chris Farley. The man is already practically a comedic icon. He plays Alan exactly as Stu describes Alan's character, "Don't let the beard fool you. He's a child." Alan doesn't swear, he goes out for a night of partying in Vegas wearing a T-shirt with a painting of a wolf and he explains to the guys he won't be able to hang with them when they get back, because the Jonas brothers will be in town. We believe that Alan would behave the way he does and say the strange and sometimes moronic things he does, in every scene. Perhaps the best example of this would be when Stu tells him that his grandmother's holocaust ring is missing and Alan replies, "I didn't know they gave out rings at the holocaust."<br /><br />That's just one of many, folks. See it. After all, The Hangover has made cinematic history by becoming the highest grossing R-Rated comedy of all time.</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Though I felt that the inclusion of the stereotypical Asian character was rather stupid and not very funny, on the whole The Hangover is a fresh, original comedy that doesn't follow any preordained path in giving the audience a lot of laughs (mainly from Zach Galifianakis, who single-handedly makes this movie) and lends itself to compulsive quoting and rewatching.<br /><br />3/4</p></br><a href="../users/A1ZOF747O5EB6R.html">A1ZOF747O5EB6R</a><br/><p>What a hoot!  "The Hangover" is a rollercoaster of fun.  Often unpredictable but always refreshing and off beat; this is a very funny film.<br /><br />Four friends go to Vegas a few days before the impending marriage of one of them.  And they are four very different people: a school teacher, a nerdy dentist, a fat weirdo and the soon to be betrothed.  The night begins with drinks on the roof of "Caesar's Palace" where they hope for a night to remember.  Unfortunately, their drinks have been fixed with a date rape drug and, the next morning, they can remember nothing.  To make matters worse, one of them has gone missing and it's the one who's getting married in another day.  Their task is to reconstruct the events of the previous night and, in so doing, locate their friend.<br /><br />What a night!  They have found a baby, stolen a tiger, one of them has been married and lost a tooth, visited a hospital and driven off with a police car; and they can't remember a thing.  The next day is also a barrel of fun.  They encounter hoodlums, they are blackmailed, tasered by the police and have an encounter with Mike Tyson.<br /><br />I've probably said too much already.  However, I dare anyone to put these clues together without having seen the film.  Let's leave it at that.  See this film and laugh.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FDEI5P21XX6S.html">A3FDEI5P21XX6S</a><br/><p>I finally got to see this film and the Blu gave a nice first viewing, and even doing the rated/unrated back to back it still kept me laughing.<br /><br />The Blu clarity and sound quality are solid and there were no failings even with the volume of night sequences. The desert shots were done adequately so there was no light saturation or blur - overall the presentation in both versions makes them a good investment for being one of the few comedies you might buy on Blu. The unrated runs eight minutes longer and contained nothing that would warrant the usual attraction for being titled as such. By the time they get to the roof to start the night there were four brief sequences added in, including some extra dialogue in the opening house scene, a little more with that abusive girlfriend and a fun spot in the hotel room. The main difference between the two would be a funny one minute scene as they take the tiger back to Tyson's house (elevator addition). Otherwise, there are no R rated additions like some would look for.<br /><br />The supplements are a mixed bag, and after investing the hour it takes to get through them all (except the commentary) none of them stand out as a must see.<br /><br />Standard Special Features (2 Disc DVD and BD)<br />* The missing pictures. 100 added photos from the camera, a few funny ones but they felt like the pics you would screen out before you share with your buddies (10 shots from the same angle, where you get rid of the other 9 and save the best one - they keep the other 9 here).<br />* Map of Destruction. Has 15 spots they filmed on a selectable icon map that takes you to a brief clip regarding making-of info. The Tyson one was the most interesting for me as the others are all either too short or not interesting.<br />* Madness of Ken Jeong. This guy doesn't work for me other than brief shots in a film so his "improv" here wasn't funny.<br />* Action Mash-Up. A brief Stooges style mix, forgettable.<br />* Three Best Friends Song. Funny in a movie, not funny as a long version when they can't sing.<br />* The Dan Band. The clean version of the Fame song.<br />* Gag Reel. Now this was funny, only goes a few minutes but they were having fun.<br /><br />BD Exclusive: (BD Live)<br /><br />* Cursing Mash-Up. My player took a few seconds to download/stream it and it only lasted a few seconds, most customers get a chuckle out of it when I screen it in the store, but just ok as a supplement.<br />* Iron Mike Online Teaser. A decent rendition of him singing the In The Air Tonight. That played well and customers thought it a much better trailer than the standard ones we have seen 100 times.<br /><br />Theatrical BD Version:<br /><br />* PiP Commentary with Phillips and the three main guys. I usually love commentaries but this one stunk. I was expecting a great deal of humor, funny stories and cool info, but instead they were just sitting there looking bored, especially Cooper, I honestly think he was there to watch the film. Galifianakis sat there until minute 16 before he really said anything. Every once in awhile Todd would say something interesting about the film making, but don't watch this if you want the laughs.<br /><br />A fun movie with plenty of laughs on a good Blu that for some of the low prices I have seen here and elsewhere it will feel like a good investment.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I know that it has gotten a lot of flack for being `overrated', but seriously, this movie is ridiculously hilarious.  I avoided it, thinking that it was just going to be an overuse of gross out humor, but it really isn't.  Sure, it is offensive, but it is done in a VERY humorous way that makes this one never-ending laugh riot.  It had NO BUSINESS winning all those comedy awards over the far more refreshing `(500) Days of Summer', but that is no reason to pan this film as unworthy of our attention.  The jokes are all different and all hit with reckless abandon.  The performances are fleshed out beautifully, and all of the actors really have great interaction with one another, which creates a natural chemistry even in the midst of highly unnatural circumstances.  Bradley Cooper is dapper and charming, Ed Helms is hilariously unnerved and Zach Galifianakis is a comedic goldmine here.  His performance is one of the best comedic performances of the decade.  He really understands how NOT to overdue it while making sure that he is completely over the line.  I never stopped laughing.  The plot itself may have its fair share of holes and it may not all make sense (it's a slapstick buddy comedy, so it really isn't supposed to) but that doesn't matter because the screenplay is so rich with comedic engagement that you forget all about the fact that its one of the most improbably comedies in recent years.  What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas is not a phrase that carries a lot of weight, but this film makes VERY good use of that ageless moniker.  I totally recommend this movie.  If you are looking forward to just laying back and soaking in the laughter, this one delivers in spades...and then some!</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>My husband and I found this movie to be very hilarious. What I like about its basically one movie that goes from one crazy event to another. Yet it doesn't loose it's focus on its main plot and also knows to find the time to work on its characters as well. The characters are all being handled and build-up well into the movie. It's the same type of comedy approach Director Phillips used earlier for movies such as "Road Trip" and "Old School". Todd Phillips knows how to bring teenage lame humor as something hilarious and also convincing.<br /><br />The movie relies heavily on its main concept. It feels like though that the entire story got based around the writers thoughts of having a couple of guys wake up in a wrecked hotel room and things are missing and other things suddenly are in their room and most importantly one of their buddies who is about to get married is missing. It's like they first come up with this idea and then decided to write and base the entire story around this. This has as a result though that not all things reach a satisfying closure. It also has as a result that things get raveled at times, as can best been seen during its end credits when gets revealed what happened all during their long night, they remembered nothing about the next morning.<br /><br />So well, no, the movie isn't perfect but still it's one of the more enjoyable ones of recent years, along with "Tropic Thunder". The movie is throughout funny and even during its weaker moments it knows to entertain, which is also due to its characters. The movie has a sort of adventurous feeling over it, since the movie jumps from the one extreme event into the other one. It's a comedy-odyssey.<br /><br />The movie doesn't really feature any well known comedy actors in it for its main parts. This works well though for the story I feel, since in cases when movies have big comedy-stars in it, the movie and its humor mostly rely on the performances from those stars and puts most of the emphasis one them. In this case it can rely more on its story, situations and the characters as individuals. The movie still features some well known actors in it though, mostly in some cameo-roles. There are not too many though, which is a good thing, so it doesn't ever get distracting.  So aside from that "The Hangover" is, without a doubt, one of 2009's funniest and most competently-made comedies.</p></br><a href="../users/A3P7WNM0UHV4YQ.html">A3P7WNM0UHV4YQ</a><br/><p>I would not recommend this movie. It is pretty bad - a bad weak story - unintelligent plot. If you have time to waste and want to see mindless action go for it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JTD6D79HNA5X.html">A2JTD6D79HNA5X</a><br/><p>This film reminds me of "Dude, Where's my Car?" I won't compare but this film was funny. It was well done and it was exciting seeing how the events of the previous night unfolded. From the missing tooth, to the baby in the closet, to the tiger in the bathroom, it's one funny moment after another. Maybe it's true that the more you can't remember the more fun the night must have been.</p></br><a href="../users/A26R4PDCZX5SOK.html">A26R4PDCZX5SOK</a><br/><p>5 of 5 stars for the comedy The Hangover. Let's see, take four guys (one to get married in two days), add Las Vegas, some drugs, shake well and you end-up the next day in a hotel suite with strippers, a tiger, a trashed room, a missing mattress, a missing front tooth, a live chicken and a missing bride groom. What's the problem? Noone remembers what happened--nothing, nada, zip. This movie is about the quest to learn what happened last night--and to find Douggie (the bride groom). The three remaining guys set-out to unwind the nights events, including a trip to a wedding chapel, discovery of a new wife (former stripper) for one of the three guys and a visit to the home of Mike Tyson (the boxer). This is a very funny movie with extreme moments and odd ball surprises. Two buckets of nuked popcorn are a must for this funny movie! Well made, extremely well written (who thinks of this stuff??) and really fun to watch. OK, a spoiler (not): Where did the live chicken in the hotel room come from??? They never explained that one. I highly recommend this movie; however, it is for mature audiences, lots of adult stuff. Oh, the infant found in their hotel room was a professionally trained stunt baby, so noone was hurt.</p></br><a href="../users/A10DB0H2NZF11E.html">A10DB0H2NZF11E</a><br/><p>Whoever wrote this movie is very, very scary.<br />We laughed through the entire movie!</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>The Hangover is the wildly successful, 2009 buddy-comedy directed by Todd Phillips that has become a cultural phenomenon and has a sequel being released in the next couple of months. When I first saw the trailer, it revealed a comedy that took place in Vegas, had a couple moments worthy of smirking about, and a cameo by Mike Tyson. It didn't appear to be anything special and I expected it to be moderate box-office success, mildly funny, but unmemorable. I was wrong...The Hangover is not without its generic moments, but it's a fresh, hilarious comedy that is still funny even after seeing it several times.<br /><br />Phillips opens his film in the middle of the story with Phil (Bradley Cooper) telling a woman over the telephone that he can't find Doug and she won't be getting married in the next few hours. Hours earlier, Doug (Justin Bartha) left for Las Vegas with Phil, Stu (Ed Helms), and his soon-to-be brother-in-law Alan (Zach Galifianakis) for his bachelor party. While the night starts off well, the next morning everyone awakens in their destroyed hotel suite to find that not only is Doug missing...But there's a tiger in the bathroom. Of course, the rest of the film is about the three hung-over friends trying to find Doug before his wedding and the ridiculous (yet hilarious) situations they find themselves in.<br /><br />What immediately separates this movie from the typical idiotic comedy is the characters, particularly the three leads. These are not generic, stock-characters; they have their own established personalities and are all likeable for their own reason. Phil is a school-teacher, married with a child, looking forward to getting away from his boring life; Stu is a dentist, whose over-bearing girlfriend beats him; Alan is an awkward, inept man-child. The chemistry of these three actors, whose varied styles of humor complement each other and make for an even funnier film, is the main reason why this film works, while credit must also must be given to the writers Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (as well as Todd Phillips and Jeremy Garelick, who are uncredited). The actors are given material to work with that has some of the contrivances of other, less memorable comedies but has better characterization, a little more originality, and never seems to strain for laughs. Even the Mike Tyson-cameo, which I expected to just be a typical unnecessary celebrity cameo, is actually pretty funny.<br /><br />There's hardly a minute of this film that isn't hilarious and it's filled with memorable, quotable dialogue. While it's almost a clich&eacute; to mention now, try keeping a straight-face during Alan's "wolf-pack" speech. The hilarity doesn't end when the credits begin to roll either, as you'll see. I've seen The Hangover four times and what has impressed me even more about this film is how it's gotten better and funnier on each viewing, while I expected the opposite. The Hangover is a surprising success in more ways than one and while it's reached a level of success that has caused many people to shout "it's overrated," you will likely embrace this movie the way most of the world has. If you're looking for an all-out, laugh-a-minute comedy you shouldn't be disappointed by this. Despite its enduring popularity, I can't say for sure if this film will go down in comedy history, but I didn't expect it to become the highest grossing R-rated comedy in United States box-office history either.<br /><br />GRADE: A-</p></br><a href="../users/AJKWF4W7QD4NS.html">AJKWF4W7QD4NS</a><br/><p>A surprise smash hit when released over the summer, The Hangover is probably one of the funniest R-rated slob comedies you'll come across in some time.  With the impending nuptuals of their best friend Doug (Justin Bartha) approaching, Phil (Bradley Cooper), Stu (Ed Helms), and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) take him to Vegas for a night he'll never forget.  Trouble is Alan isn't all that bright, and accidentally laces all their drinks with roofies.  When Phil, Stu, and Alan all wake up the next day, there's a tiger in their bathroom, a baby in the closet, Stu's missing a tooth, and Doug is missing.  What develops throughout The Hangover ranges from predictable to absolutely hilarious and back again, and even though it loses steam as it winds down towards its conclusion, this is definitely the funniest film that Todd Phillips has made since Old School.  With cameos and small roles from Heather Graham, Jeffrey Tambor, Mike Epps, and Mike Tyson as himself.</p></br><a href="../users/ANOAF9M5MTJHN.html">ANOAF9M5MTJHN</a><br/><p>agin this is a movie can be rated between five star and two it's not a one, but i rate these movies how good they could be and compared to the others.  this movie did great in the movie theatre because it was about the only movie released any good or that month but it was funny unrelistic but funny . if you like lot of little laughs and new and different scenes this movie is for you</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>This is the kind of comedy where the actual laughs GROW on you very gradually.  You have to be a bit patient and wait for them, because let's be honest, the first 20 minutes of film are certainly nothing to brag about.  The juvenile humor that takes place in the very beginning of the movie is *extremely* misleading.<br /><br />The main reason the Hangover is so good to me has MORE to do with the storyline than the style of humor.  Seriously!<br /><br />The storyline is good- four... er, make that *three* young guys wake up one morning with a MAJOR hangover, and they have absolutely no idea what happened the night before.  All they have to go on as far as remembering what happened the night before are the things right in front of them, at the hotel room, such as a baby in the closet, a tiger in the bathroom, one of the guys having a missing tooth, and other things.<br /><br />Without spoiling anything, these three guys go on an adventure of a lifetime as they retrace their steps through Las Vegas.<br /><br />There's also a very dirty and disgusting kind of humor that manages to weave itself through the storyline, so I can only recommend this movie to people who are 16 years old or older.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y.html">A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y</a><br/><p>The Hangover has to be the Best Movie I have seen lately and my Favorite So far, A movie doesn't have to have Will Ferrell in order for it to be funny,and in a Age when modern movies really stink it is a welcome refreshment, From Carlos the Baby and The Tiger in The Bathroom to Paging Dr.Fa..et...

Director Todd Phillips put together this  somewhat simple film about a bunch of regular guys on a Bachelor Party trip to Vegas, but to add Zach to the mix, everything goes hilariously wrong, but in a more original way than most films about idiot behavior. Cooper, Bartha and Helms are adults with their own very different agendae; add future brother-in-law Zach, a slightly socio-impaired individual, and insanity ensues. There's no end of fun, and Heather Graham is there in a delightful performance, quite lovable. I enjoyed this film a lot. The DVD had no extras, and that was a REAL bummer.Script was quite fine, and the woman who played Helms' fianc&eacute;e was the perfect bitch.

Now joining these illustrious ranks is THE HANGOVER, a raunchy, ornery, in-your-face kneeslapper that blazes a new trail into the comedic badlands.  Centered around a bachelor trip to Vegas gone awry, this movie is not only hysterical, it's well-crafted and delivered by an extraordinary ensemble of actors.  There are no weak links here.<br /><br />Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, and Justin Bartha all bring their own unique talents to their roles as four pals celebrating one last guys' night out before one of them (Bartha) gets hitched on Sunday.  Of course, their first night on the town goes astray once their drinks are laced with Rohypnol; they all wake up on Saturday morn with no memory of what took place the night before, and worse still, they've lost the groom-to-be.  Their subsequent "quest" to find their pal drives the engine of this comedy, as their wacky adventures have them crossing paths with the likes of a delightfully insane Ken Jeong to Mike Tyson (playing himself).  THE HANGOVER then rushes to its whirlwind climax, culminating in the four friends finally taking a look at pics from a digital camera of their forgotten Friday night--a hysterically funny ending to an outrageous comedy gem.<br />--D.

A word of caution: this movie is only mildly funny and watchable but not the funniest comedy ever.<br />Some crazy characters, witty one -liners and funny dialogues make this a a fun watch. Mike Tyson is hilarious but the real star of the movie is Zack Galifianakis. I liked the movie but it deserved only three stars. 3/22/10</p></br><a href="../users/A2UYAFQ40U2PHS.html">A2UYAFQ40U2PHS</a><br/><p>This is not the greatest comedy ever made.  It's probably one of the most overhyped comedies in recent memory.  But it isn't terrible, and it's not the gross out comedy that many have said it is.  It's a mediocre film at best that has some funny moments, and has some moments that make you wonder who could write such a bad script.<br /><br />Many times in the film you see a situation (like when the boys wake up and find a tiger in the bathroom), and the characters in the film constantly say "oh my god, there's a tiger in the bathroom.  How the f*** did that tiger get in the bathroom?  Man, I can't remember how that tiger got in the bathroom" and so on and so on.  This type of situation happens a lot during the film (especially the first half), and it's really poor scripting.  The first half drags because of this poor scripting.  I almost shut the DVD off, but luckily, the film picks up in the 2nd half.  It's almost like the filmmakers realised that they had to finish the film, and decided to wrap things up very, very quickly.<br /><br />Bradley Cooper's character is a very smarmy guy and not very sympathetic.  The dentist is actually a decent sort saddled with a ferociously bitchy girlfriend (played by Rachel Harris), and Zach G plays a guy who is supposed to be nerdy and funny, but quite often he comes across as weird and creepy, not funny.  But there are some good moments in the film, especially the scene where the 3 guys are in the police station, and one of the officers (played by Rob Riggle) calls Zach G "fat Jesus".  Then the 3 guys get tazed by the cops and an audience of kids touring the police station.  It's the funniest scene in the film.  The black drug dealer (called Black Doug in the film) is also a good character and the performance is very funny.<br /><br />While this film is overhyped, it is not the most overrated comedy I've ever seen (that honor still belongs to Knocked Up), and I didn't feel like I was cheated after watching the movie.  Aside from Bradley Cooper's character, the overall tone of the film isn't smug.  It's just light.  So, watch the movie if you like this type of humour.  It's a decent rent.</p></br><a href="../users/A18GP1PWVTKXQQ.html">A18GP1PWVTKXQQ</a><br/><p>*** This review contains spoilers ***<br /><br />  Before seeing 'The Hangover', I heard that it was about some guys who hold a bachelor party in Las Vegas. I was expecting a night of ribaldry, chronicling the bachelor party (along the lines of 'Superbad'--except with the characters being a bit older). But the great thing about 'The Hangover' is that all the action happens AFTER the bachelor party occurs, the next day. It's a tremendously clever idea where the comedy is in the unraveling of the mystery as to what happened to the protagonists during a bachelor party which they cannot recall.<br /><br />  In the Act One setup, we're first introduced to the principals: Doug is about to be married and along with his brother-in-law, the off-the-wall Alan, joined by Doug's buddies, Stu, a dentist, and Phil, an elementary school teacher, decide to go to Las Vegas two days before the wedding for a surreptitious bachelor party. We then cut to five hours before the wedding, with Phil making a desperate call to Doug's fianc&eacute; informing her that they've lost Doug and it looks like the wedding is off. Then we flashback to the revelers' arrival at Caesar's Palace in Vegas, where they go up to the hotel roof where loose cannon Alan toasts Doug by cutting himself with a knife--he invites everyone to join in a little blood letting as a sort of initiation rite but the others turn him down as they all think Alan is a little bit off the wall.<br /><br />  The break into Act Two occurs with Alan, Stu and Phil waking up in a trashed hotel room sans Doug. To make matters worse, there's a live tiger in the bathroom, a crying baby in the kitchen and Stu the Dentist is missing a tooth. They go downstairs and give the parking valet a stub, only to have him drive up with a police car, with the valet addressing the bumbling threesome as 'officers' and 'wishing them a good day'.<br /><br />  Soon it becomes clear why Alan, Stu and Phil can't remember anything that happened the night before. Alan thought he was slipping a tab of ecstasy into their drinks but it turns out that it was Rohypnol (aka "Roofies"), a date rape drug, which he bought from a confused drug dealer (also named Doug who later figures in the plot). I'm not sure if I recall the exact sequence of what happens next but basically the three end up at a wedding chapel where they discover that the night before Stu got hitched to a Vegas stripper. They locate her and fortunately she's the baby's mother. When the bumbling buddies return to their hotel room, waiting for them there is Mike Tyson himself along with one of his handler's. It seems that the boys stole Tyson's pet tiger and in a rather amusing scene, drug the tiger and drive it back to Big Mike's mansion. More outrageous obstacles soon are placed in the protagonists' way.<br /><br />  It seems that the night before, Alan was playing craps with a Chinese gangster, Mr. Chow. He ends up taking off with Chow's gambling winnings amounting to $80,000. Chow and his thugs confront Alan, Stu and Phil and reveal that they are holding Doug and demand that they come up with his money or else they'll never see their buddy gain. In one of the few long-winded scenes in the film, Alan wins $80,000 by employing card counting techniques while playing blackjack back at the casino. They all drive out to the desert where they give Chow the money but he hands over a black guy named Doug who happens to be the drug dealer who sold Alan the 'roofies'.<br /><br />  We're back at the point where the flashback began toward the beginning of the film. Phil is calling Doug's fianc&eacute; informing her that Doug cannot be located and the wedding is off. But suddenly Stu figures it all out. Earlier, the guys had noticed that Doug's mattress was impaled on the obelisk in front of the hotel. He realizes that Doug could not have thrown the mattress from the hotel windows since they don't open--the only conclusion is that they had brought Doug up to the roof the night before and he's been stuck up there since nightfall. All's well that ends well when the prospective groom and his three buddies drive back to Los Angeles just in time for the wedding (in a hilarious scene while they're driving on the highway, they have their tuxedos thrown to them from a tuxedo company van--obviously having ordered the tuxes beforehand from the car, using a cell phone and credit card).<br /><br />  The final scene is one of the best--they discover a digital camera with all the pictures of the groups' hi-jinx the night before. They all agree to look at the pictures once and then erase all of them. As the credits roll, the pictures reveal the machinations of the bumbling threesome during their crazed night out on the town.<br /><br />  Of all the characters, I thought Stu the dentist was the funniest. We finally do find out how he lost that tooth--and the scene where he stands up to his overbearing girlfriend at the film's climax was hilarious. I expected a little more with Alan's character as he was introduced as to be the really crazy one at the beginning--but somehow I wanted him to do even more crazy things at the end. Kudos especially to Ken Jeong as Mr. Chow, the foul-mouthed Chinese gangster, who was truly a hoot!<br /><br />  Some of the jokes in "The Hangover" don't always hit the mark--the bit about the police tasering the hapless trio in front of a bunch of schoolchildren just seemed a little too much. Nonetheless, 'The Hangover' has proved to be the sleeper hit comedy of 2009 with its one welcome bizarre situation after another.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>Just watched this on DVD, and while I laughed several times, I felt that I've seen most of this material before. Take equal parts "Go" and "Dude, Where's My Car," throw in a dash of "Sideways," and you've got "The Hangover."  It's certainly funny in spots, but there's too much violence for a comedy in my opinion; watching people get badly beaten, tasered, etc. is not my idea of humor.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ.html">A3DHQ5WO80X1IZ</a><br/><p>Funniest movie of the year, hands down! I remember seeing 'Knocked Up' in a crowded theater in Chicago, and thought it was one of the funniest movies ever. But seeing it again at home, I thought it was okay, but not The Greatest Comedy of the Decade like it seemed in the packed movie house.<br /><br />'The Hangover', on the other hand, was just as funny when watched at home, and it didn't need a crowd to egg me on. I'm sitting in my basement and laughing uproaringly into an empty room! And not caring!!<br /><br />Basic premise - four guys go to Vegas for a bachelor party. They wake up, and no one remembers what happens, and the groom is missing. What follows is kind of 'Memento'-meets-Judd-Apatow-movie, as they try to trace the clues that will lead them to their friend. And don't even ask how Mike Tyson and a tiger get involved!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Maybe I had a hype-hangover leading up to my viewing of The Hangover. Because I expected one of the best comedies ever based on all of the reviews that I had read. What I got what a really good comedy...not great...but really good.<br /><br />The Hangover has plenty of laugh out loud and "oh-my-God" moments. I'm a true sucker for slapstick and The Hangover has its fair share of that too. The story is just silly--deliberately so--with 4 guys "accidentally" taking a date rape drug combined with mucho alcohol, and instead of the 4 of 'em falling flat on their faces immediately, they basically sleepwalk into some unbelievable, but hilarious escapades that none of them remember in the morning...including losing one of their buddies.<br /><br />So the next day, the "unlost boys" spend their time backtracking to find the lost boy only to discover the zany stuff that they had been into the night before with mostly hilarious results. The acting is great by a bunch of guys that I really didn't recognize prior to seeing this movie, and I'd still need to check the credits today to tell you a single one of their names. Jeffery Tambor makes an appearance as does Heather Graham, but their small parts are far overshadowed by the three guys looking for their buddy.<br /><br />There are some very memorable moments in this movie that almost had me giving it 4 stars instead of three. But then I thought about the company of 4 star movies that I'd be putting The Hangover into and it just didn't compute. So by all means, see The Hangover. It's funny! Just try not to be jaded in advance by all of the reviews that suggest the movie is some kind of classic.</p></br><a href="../users/A15U64VGUV6RBF.html">A15U64VGUV6RBF</a><br/><p>That's probably the best way to describe this raunchy, far-fetched and ultimately hilarious adult oriented comedy. The characters are put in the most ridiculous situations as they attempt to recall the events of the previous night, and their responses and reactions are what drive the movie forward. This premise could easily have been made into a lesser movie (see Hangover II), but Todd Phillips takes them to the farthest edge of Vegas and beyond. Personally I don't recall ever laughing as hard as I did when the guys are just coming to after their debauchery and discovering what has happened to their hotel suite. If you're one of the 5 people or so who haven't see this yet, what are you waiting for? Comedy classic.</p></br><a href="../users/AG0TA24LI0XV7.html">AG0TA24LI0XV7</a><br/><p>This was the kind of comedy movie where I was laughing because I felt obligated to; most of the scenarios, characters, and dialogue seemed like they were supposed to elicit laughs. They were not innately funny. I like a comedy where I laugh completely by instinct, not out of pity or obligation. Now, there is some occasional funny stuff to be found in "The Hangover"; it's largely hit or miss. But for the most part this film is not the riotous, awesome experience that many people have claimed it to be. It's amusing. But nothing to get excited about.<br /><br />Part of the reason I saw this film was Roger Ebert's glowing, 3.5 out of 4 stars review. Not so thrilled with that now that I've seen the flick. He practically made it out to be another "Animal House" or "The Blues Brothers", the way he described it. And to be honest, a generous chunk of his review was plot synopsis. I can get that elsewhere. But I digress.<br /><br />In "The Hangover", I didn't care about the characters. The three guys were all flawed (which is necessary in comedy) but none of them was likeable. The weirdo with the beard (Zach Galifianakis as Alan Garner... this has been called a 'stand-out' or 'breakout' performance, for some reason) was very odd and deadpan, but he did not have the makings of a great comedy character. And actually, it was established early on that he's a pedophile.<br /><br />There are silly things in the film, but there are also things that I didn't find amusing: harming a baby for a laugh doesn't work for me. Plus, I felt that many things seen in this film had been done before. And there was even a "Rain Man" homage. I guess that's supposed to be cute. Whatever.<br /><br />The nice 'n tidy, happy-ever-after, tacked-on ending of this movie made me want to heave. Why does America always need happy or nice endings all the time? Couldn't a comedy film end on a sour note once in a while? It's almost bizarre to have a movie like this-- where there is an impending sense of doom running through it-- end on a pleasant note.<br /><br />This is worth checking out for a couple of giggles, if you want to satisfy curiosity. Most of us can relate to a night of overt decadence and some next-morning forgetfulness. (This must have have been one long night these guys spent in their drugged stupor.) But I won't be seeking this film out for a second viewing; not a chance. If I want to laugh I will stick with Mel Brooks films, early Woody Allen movies, Monty Python, The Marx Brothers, or the Christopher Guest mockumentaries. For my money, "The Hangover" belongs with other highly overrated comedy movies like "Meet the Parents", "American Pie", and "There's Something About Mary".</p></br><a href="../users/A2BPDFR58H9575.html">A2BPDFR58H9575</a><br/><p>I've seen this comedy twice, two days in the row. First, with my husband, and then on the New Year Eve, with the company of friends. Everyone enjoyed it and laughed a lot. I liked it both times, the second time as much as the first one, and this is not usually my kind of comedies. I prefer my comedy more sophisticated, subtle, witty, but Hangover somehow won me over. It started and ended fairly predictable, but in the middle - the night that four friends spent conquering Las Vegas and throwing the bachelor party to end all bachelor parties, of which they have no recollection the following morning, -this part of the movie was very funny. Just to picture once again in my mind the battle field that their posh hotel suite in the Cesar's Palace has became, with the Bengal tiger occupied the bathroom and meeting every visitor with the scary roar, with the lonely chicken walking on the floor, and with the baby-by in the closet, makes me laugh again. And I did not mention that one of the friends is missing his front tooth, another is wearing the hospital wrist band, and the groom has disappeared in the thin air. Did the tiger eat him or did he turn into the chicken or became a baby?  When Mike Tyson appears in the middle of the film as a visitor of three friends who were desperately looking for their friend and tried to figure out what exactly did happen last night, I knew that I liked the movie. Tyson singing in unison with Phil Collins and demanding that his pet-tiger who was stolen from his mansion must be delivered back to him or else, was a stroke of genius. Don Luis Bunuel would have loved that scene, I am sure.<br /><br />We were watching uncut full version. Many of the jokes were far below the waist but the performers seem amused at what they were doing on the screen, and when this happens, then the audience laugh. Not for sensitive viewers, who easily blush and get insulted.<br /><br />The Hangover may be described in two sentences,  what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas and with the opening line from Mr. Doolittlle song in My Fair Lady,"Just get me to the church in time". We all have seen many movies about bachelor parties, Vegas, hangover, and male bonding. Hangover does not tell anything new but thanks to the clever writing and the real chemistry among Bradley Cooper (Phil, the schoolteacher), Ed Helms (Stu, the dentist), and Zach Galiifanakis (nerdy, socially akward brother-in-low to be homage to the Rainman), the film keeps the viewers interest and provides more than few laughs. Did I  mention Mike Tyson who almost overplayed the professional actors?<br /><br />3.5 of 5</p></br><a href="../users/A1WUMTJOASEL5F.html">A1WUMTJOASEL5F</a><br/><p>This almost reminds me of the time I was looking forward to the west Hollywood special cheap Sunday beer bust only to notice on newspaper stand that it was Monday. Yes folks, this kind of drug induced alcohol related amnesia can happen given the right cosmic dust. Four buddies celebrate bachelor party in Las Vegas to discover expensive royal flat is into total mayhem complete with baby, animals, destruction, and missing unaccounted for partner who happens to be the groom. Many disarray pieces lay strewn about with only telltale clues from casual witnesses who happened to be there as well as quickie bride, victims of crime, and stolen articles. If anyone has seen the legendary comedy flick "It's a mad, mad, mad, mad world" then you know the unstoppable pace to this one as the three out of it buddies try to piece their whereabouts' and solve the mysteries of telltale leftovers and disappearing vehicle, plus missing buddie. A great romp of who did it, and why it happened as they gradually backtrack their drunken stupor steps, with a satisfying ending of tell all phone photographs after the mysteries have been solved for a pleasant closing credits roll.</p></br><a href="../users/AQZH7YTWQPOBE.html">AQZH7YTWQPOBE</a><br/><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UV4XEW">The Hangover</a> is another puerile comedy - nothing more, nothing less. It's certainly better than most comedies out there today. I'd give it 3.5-4 stars overall. It is funny and has some classic moments - tiger in the bathroom, the Holocaust ring, etc. Zach Galifianakis was particularly hilarious ("I didn't know they gave rings out at the Holocaust"). It also has a decent plot, as the trio attempts to find one of their missing wingmen.<br /><br />Unfortunately, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UV4XEW">The Hangover</a> feels more like a bunch of intermittent funny jokes, rather than one hilarious rout. It's funny, but not bed-wetting or tear-inducing funny.

The next thing we know, three of the four friends wake up in their trashed hotel room with absolutely no memory of the evening prior. Doug's missing, there's a live tiger in the bathroom, and judging from the evidence in their pockets, members in their party both got married and went to the hospital during the evening's shenanigans.<br /><br />The rest of the movie finds Phil, Stu, and Alan trying to retrace their steps and find the missing bridegroom. The convoluted plot has them gambling to earn Doug's ransom money and doing everything they can not to wreck a loaned Mercedes.<br /><br />Hubs and I laughed and laughed and laughed.<br /><br />Be forewarned - this movie is NOT for the easily offended. There are tons of absolutely horrible language, VERY adult situations, nudity, and everything else you would expect to see when four guys are up to no good in Vegas.<br /><br />But if you can get past that, the script is hilarious (You will be quoting the one-liners for WEEKS.), there are some really fun cameos, and the whole thing feels like a bawdy and thoroughly enjoyable adult romp.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>There are a lot of movies about bachelor parties, but this is probably the funniest.

Yes there is nudity, but not what most would associate with a bachelor party.  Yes there is intoxication, but again not the type normally associated with a bachelor party.  Yes there are girls and gambling and gangsters all thrown in to make everything more interesting.  And there is one really mean pussy cat to top it off.  Overall, a great movie and by far the funniest of 2009.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>Watching this movie I was trying to compare it to other comedies I have seen.  I guess it similar in humor type to the first National Lampoon Vacation film with both serious and silly mixed in.<br /><br />The movie is one of those that begins showing you the near ending of the movie where a guy is calling the fiancee of his friend to tell her that her husband to be will not be showing up to their wedding which is due to start in five hours.  Most of the rest of the movie attempts to tell how this happened.<br /><br />A guy about to be married goes to Vegas with three friends.  One is a total "John Belushi type" and the other two are his friends.  One friend is in a relationship with an overly controlling woman and he lies to her telling he is going on a wine tasting business trip to Napa Valley.<br /><br />The four take a very expensive suite in Vegas and go up to the roof to drink a toast to their friendship and the upcoming wedding of their friend.  The next thing they know they are waking up in their suite the next day which has been trashed and has both a live tiger in the bathroom and a baby (see the poster) in it and their friend to be married has disappeared.<br /><br />The rest of the movie has them trying to piece together what happened the previous night and to locate their missing friend.  They learn they had done unbelievable things and have both a crimelord and Mike Tyson after them.  The movie is very different from most of the comedies that have come out in the last year or so and a lot more fun than most especially the prolifieration of the Jude Apatow movies that seem to constantly come out.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Man, I know there's nothing at all funny about a car door accidentally slamming into a baby's face... except I couldn't help laughing, anyway. I say THE HANGOVER deserves all the good buzz it's generated. There were so many crazy and laugh-out-loud moments in this film, I was non-stop cracking up. The film's premise sets you up for a compelling mystery, turns your head with its hints of what must have been one hell of a forgotten wild night in Vegas.<br /><br />Three hung-over friends wake up in a sorely trashed suite in Caesars Palace, and with no memory of the night before. In rapid order they find, among other peculiar things, a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in the closet, a chicken clucking around, and that one of them has lost a tooth. And also that the fourth guy in their group has gone missing. Much of THE HANGOVER details the guys' piecing together various clues, retracing their steps, trying to find out what the hell happened the night before and just where is their missing friend... who's due to be married the next day.<br /><br />You assume, going in, that you know what to expect. Crude humor. Maybe some silly slapstick. A healthy serving of raunchiness. And, mind you, this is the same director that did OLD SCHOOL and ROAD TRIP. And, yeah, we do visit the same landscape, all of the above stuff mentioned. Except better. I don't know if I can pin-point it exactly. THE HANGOVER doesn't have the heart of KNOCKED UP or KNOCKED UP's sweet unlikely romance, and I do think that Heather Graham should've been given more scenes. But I think the screenplay is really good. Then there's the smart execution. The dialogue is outrageous and wicked funny and there is a minefield of memorable one-liners. The core players, while not exactly given deeply explored character arcs, have sharply delineated personalities and these guys certainly play off each other effectively. The leads are each saddled with his personal albatross. Stu the straight-laced dentist is living in relationship hell, constantly bullied by his overbearing girlfriend. Phil the school teacher is larcenous and immature and an unrepentant instigator. And oh dear God, Alan... Alan is overweight and a man-child and weird as [...]-all. Doug, well, Doug's gone missing.<br /><br />A sweet-natured hooker, a simpering Asian crime lord, a singing Mike Tyson, and more. One improbable thing after another keeps piling on, and you can't help but get suckered in if only to see how everything fits. And while not everything does get explained away - like, what exactly was up with the chicken? - you'll find that enough light is shed on the unrecollected crazy that went down. It's advised that you stick around for the end credits, as even more 'splainin' unfolds.<br /><br />THE HANGOVER has no pretense about what it is. It aims for low brow laughs, and it hits the target more so than it misses. I frankly don't think it misses that often. It for sure doesn't try to impart life lessons, except that you maybe do learn one thing: nothing good can ever come from bachelor parties in Vegas. But we knew that already.</p></br><a href="../users/A5TZXWU8AALIC.html">A5TZXWU8AALIC</a><br/><p>The one thing that jumped out at me...where this movie differs from most alleged "comedies" these days...was the script.  It doesn't follow a basic storyline.  It jumps around.  And it's not hard to follow for doing that.  It presents a mystery with the mayhem: What did we do last night?<br /><br />The film opens with a group of buds heading to a bachelor party in Las Vegas.  Nothing too unusual.  Tom Hanks did this 20-some years ago in BACHELOR PARTY.<br /><br />Then the film jumps ahead to the morning after.  The buds wake up.  And nothing makes sense.  The groom is missing.  There's a tiger in the bathroom.  The luxurious (and expensive) suite is trashed.  There's a naked Asian guy in the trunk of their car.  And they don't remember a thing.<br /><br />So the buds are left to solve a mystery: what happened?<br /><br />This is rude, crude and raunchy stuff, and I laughed more than I have at most of the dismal comedies I have endured recently.<br /><br />(Make sure you stick around for the photographs shown during the end credits!)</p></br><a href="../users/A370Z6I5GBWU44.html">A370Z6I5GBWU44</a><br/><p>After all the hype this movie received before I watched it, I was expecting more. It starts off promising and with several good jokes - it quickly degenerates into a slew of stupid jokes and nonsensical situations. I don't mean funny nonsense, it just felt as if the writers were just slapping this and that together in a desperate attempt to be funny.<br /><br />The bit with the tiger made absolutely no sense, and just how they stole it is not even fully explained, and I find it ridiculous that a trio of guys that were completely hopped up/stoned/drunk were able to break into a guarded mansion to steal said tiger without getting mauled. I like tigers, but this is just ridiculous. The guys try to figure out just what happened to them and why they are hungover and don't remember what happened last night. When the truth is finally revealed, it is so stupid, but then after all the stupid things that have happened, the revelation isn't much compared to that. For all the hype and jazz this movie received, this was a major letdown.</p></br><a href="../users/A10X0JN8KTK89H.html">A10X0JN8KTK89H</a><br/><p>Certainly, there are some very funny characters and scenes in this film, but it feels like a patchwork of road trip movies you've seen before.  The movie succeeds in creating a silly comedy mystery of the absurd, and I admit I laughed often.  Too often, however, I could see the punch line from a mile away.  The movie is a series of neatly crafted punch lines without a compelling overriding comedy.  That is, every joke is the same or a more extreme variation on the same.  And so, the movie was more of an over-hyped letdown than a more genre-critical tour de force like Tropic Thunder.  I compare the two movies because they rely on the audience's previous knowledge of comedy film history, but Tropic Thunder succeeds in delivering actual Hollywood criticism where The Hangover manages the singular enticement of mere gross-out humor.  While I don't find the film to be a classic in any sense, I would still recommend it to anyone in need of a good laugh.</p></br><a href="../users/A18758S1PUYIDT.html">A18758S1PUYIDT</a><br/><p>Most of this is funny when it is supposed to be, though a few elements here and there fall flat.

This is what happens to the hapless goofballs who threw a bachelor party in Las Vegas just a few days before a wedding and then had no recollection of what happened on that night of heavy drinking and drug use.<br /><br />Not for kids, certainly, but okay for some adult laughs.</p></br><a href="../users/AER15RIMV8E6D.html">AER15RIMV8E6D</a><br/><p>This movie is incredibly hilarious and had a great storyline with great actors!

It wasn't.<br /><br />I stuck through it because it got a series of positive reviews, at least if you check on Metacritic, and I couldn't figure out why.<br /><br />The story is well put together and well-directed, but for me it's not funny enough to be an outrageous comedy, not charming enough to be a romantic comedy, and not perceptive enough to offer any real insights into life.  Or getting married.</p></br><a href="../users/A2HW33PQSRHLNO.html">A2HW33PQSRHLNO</a><br/><p>Director Todd Phillips has done that rarest of things with this film--made an actually hilarious comedy, not one that is a corny embarrassment to both oneself and the people around them.  Example:(<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZG97XI">Hot Tub Time Machine</a>.<br /><br />Four guys--Phil Wenneck (Bradley Cooper), Ed Helms (Stu Price), Zach Galifianakis (Alan Garner in an eccentric turn of brilliance as a sage-like manchild), and soon-to-be-married Doug Billings (Justin Bartha) decide to hit Vegas and have a wild time before their friend gets hitched. Not before encountering a very angry Mike Tyson, a sociopathic gay Chinese gangster, and a bunch of Indian guys who run a compromised church for intoxicated men looking to get "married".<br /><br />Nearly every turn of dialogue in this movie is an exercise in self or-other deprecating black humor punctuated by strange moments of compassion.  If he works it right, Phillips could be the future of contemporary comedy.  There is a sequel in the works.  This just about hits the mark of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00003CXAV">Kids in the Hall - Brain Candy</a> and of course <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AP04L0">Office Space - Special Edition with Flair (Widescreen Edition)</a>.  Not just recommended, this is a MUST SEE.<br /><br />(I've heard rumors that actor Bradley Cooper is going to star in a remake of "The Crow".  I sure hope that's not true, disrespectful as that would be to Brandon Lee's memory.)</p></br><a href="../users/A1P6NRWDD1NT4B.html">A1P6NRWDD1NT4B</a><br/><p>In this reviewer's mind, had THE HANGOVER been cast with well established actors, it would not have worked out or have been as funny. We hadn't really seen these actors before, so the characters seemed 'real' at the time. Funny set-up, great dialogue line-per-line,  every situation hilarious,  and to reiterate, great characters all around right down to even the wedding singer near the end of the film. An instant classic. One would beg the question, "Hasn't this been done before?" Yes, (i.e. the terrible VERY BAD THINGS) but [they] perfected it on this one.  Great support work all around from Mike Tyson (?) to veteran character actor Jeffrey Tambor as the understanding soon to be father-in-law. Hilarious!</p></br><a href="../users/A1C80B497LCYKA.html">A1C80B497LCYKA</a><br/><p>The Hangover has a great premise - waking up the morning after with all kinds of evidence as to what happened the night before, but no memory - which the trailers capitalized on. But what's in the trailers is about all there is in the film. It's a great premise, but it fails to deliver, so we end up with one very predictable, very dumb movie. Which is why it's so popular. Basically, the film validates irresponsible behavior as long as you can prove that you were high. Two things I can say that are good about this film: that is one cute baby; and Bradley Cooper is a cut above the rest of the cast. Rated R for sex, drugs and language.<br /><br />Waitsel Smith</p></br><a href="../users/AGQY11NLQJ2JL.html">AGQY11NLQJ2JL</a><br/><p>A group of silly and funny guys go to Vegas for their friend's bachelor party.

Of recent memory, the only good American comedies I've seen this year would be this, Observe and Report, Pineapple Express, the indie sleeper hit Zach and Miri Make a Porno (heavily underrated), and I Love You Man. Land of the Lost was pure poison, Step Brothers is a complete waste of film, Beer in Hell, as much as the book was funny, is one I will not see and looks like it has the production values of a Jan Terri music video.<br /><br />I was not expecting this to be that great. I had seen the trailer with Observe and Report (which I LOVED) and thought it was funny, but it looked like one I should wait till it comes out on Blu-Ray. However, midway into July, I managed to get ahold of a screener copy of the movie through a friend. So my family and I sat on the couch and watched it together.<br /><br />That said, I was surprised by how good it was! I mean, I was expecting another run of the mill, brash and rude and crude comedy. But no, this film was pure epic comedy at its best. Hell, I hate to commit blasephemy but this movie is really up there with comedy classics like Dr. Strangelove and There's Something About Mary. In fact, it may be the new TSAM. Here you have a fairly uncommon cast with a few surprises, including the gorgeously hot Heather Grahm, and even a cameo from the champ boxer Mike Tyson himself! Don't worry, no ears get bitten off here.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MFNB4E">The Midnight Meat Train</a>'s Bradley Cooper, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0016MOV9W">Semi-Pro</a>'s Ed Helms, Comedian Zach Gilifonakis and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013BM6JI">National Treasure 2: Book of Secrets</a>' Justin Bartha all star in this hilarious comedy about a group of four guys going to Vegas for one of their's bachelor party. They have an awesome night... except they wake up with their room trashed, Mike Tyson's tiger in their bathroom, and no memory of what happens. What comes for the next 2 days includes getting arrested, finding out one was married, losing money, and more!!! Even worse, the team has been reduced to 3, because one has disappeared! Now they have to continue this horrible weekend no matter what it takes to get through... and make it to the wedding!<br /><br />Let's face it, this movie is the ultimate comedy of the 2000s. I thought Superbad was a hell of an epic comedy! Well, not so much after seeing The Hangover. THe Hangover is a brilliant comedy that not only makes you laugh, but relates to real life too- people spend their lives unnecessarily getting drunk. There are tons of belly laughs, lots of WTF moments, great performances from the stellar cast, and a comedy experiences that will leave you talking about if for months to come.<br /><br />So if you haven't seen this, it's not too late to see it yet. I reccommend it- Finally some GOOD american humor! I haven't seen Zombieland, but I intend to eventually- apparently this and Zombieland re the two best comedies of 09. So go see The Hangover now!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A1ER6IYOMM8VCT.html">A1ER6IYOMM8VCT</a><br/><p>I have wanted to see this film ever since I first saw the trailer many months ago. The film lives up to and beyond my expectations as it is not only funny, but avoids the obvious pitfalls of these buddy comedies with a fresh approach. The story of "the day after" is one that is easily identified with(well at least most guys will) and by having us come along for the ride to find out what the H E L L happened the night before, keeps the viewer completely focused as if we were part of that night. Even though the basic story has been done a million times, I can not remember when it has been done better. I watched the unrated version first and I will compare the two versions soon. The Blu Ray looks great and has a nice assortment of extras, including 100 pictures from the night before that are almost as funny as the film(just make sure you watch the film first). Other extras include a gag reel, making of, map of the night before and lots more. One of the most enjoyable comedies I've seen in the past few years.</p></br><a href="../users/AVT9Q9PTUCDMR.html">AVT9Q9PTUCDMR</a><br/><p>This was huge sleeper hit but boy does it start off super slow. The first 20 minutes i did not laugh once and wondered what all the fuss was about. The movie was, frankly, plain boring but once we find the guys waking up in their suite the night after, then it starts to rock.<br /><br />There are plenty of great twists even to what you think is a linear plot. Throw in a gratuitous expose breast of Heather Graham, gratuitous Mike Tyson, a tiger, a baby, a missing tooth and stolen police car, and you have a movie.<br /><br />It does fall into that typical Hollywood movie stereotypes. You get the stripper with a heart of gold, the bitchy live-in girlfriend, a Rain Man-like winning streak at the tables and plenty of car crashes.<br /><br />With better film editing this thing could have been off the charts funny. As it is it's a good laugh but nothing like Doug Liman's Go in its ability to capture Vegas today (and even that movie was smart in using Vegas for only a third of its movie).<br /><br />Lastly, there are zero extras on this DVD release. All you get is the wide- and full-screen versions of the movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>THE HANGOVER apparently swept the country, touted as the funniest film ever made. And indeed the proof of its success lies in the fact that THE HANGOVER 2 is in post-production.  So there is more on the way.  The question arises, 'more what?'  Apparently resting on the information gathered from television sitcoms and other raunchy potty mouth movies like 'Borat' etc.,  there is an audience for films that pose middle aged men as men in their 20s performing acts that are more like boys in their misbegotten teens.  It is amazing that these films that put down African Americans (like the manipulation of Mike Tyson and the dumb drug dealer character 'Black Doug'  portrayed by Mike Epps) and Asian Americans (like the foolish over-the-top fop of 'Mr Chow' by Jen Keong, etc etc etc are not confronted.  But then it may appear that all is fair in cinema 'comedy'.<br /><br />The premise is that four friends go to Las Vegas for a bachelor party before the wedding of the most mild of them all.  Bradley Cooper (a teacher), Ed Helms (a dentist), Zach Galifianakis (the obese mentally disturbed brother of the bride) and Justin Bartha (the groom to be) spend one lost night of doped drunken misadventures and wake up in an hotel suite with a chicken, a tiger,  a mess, hangovers and amnesia, and a missing groom.  The remainder of the film is simple the antics of these broken down individuals attempting to find the groom and to right some infractions of behavior. Is that funny?  Well, apparently to the vast number of people who see this film it is. So here comes the next installment in what will likely be a long line of gross-out sequels. Meanwhile the beautiful adult movies languish in oblivion.  To this we've come?

My main problem with this film was not the stupid and repetitive humor but the uninteresting characters that we have to route for and hope they find their best friend Doug. Who cares about Doug or their journey to find out how he got kidnapped? The humor relies heavily upon random, bizarre, and illogical bursts of different characters, infliction of pain, random celebrity cameo's (Mike Tyson) and just bad dialogue. I usually don't mind this type of humor when it is executed properly and in a timely fashion.<br /><br />This film, on the other hand, is just a poor excuse for another college humor comedy. The sad part is that these hero's were supposed to be routing for are like in their 30's with wives and kids, pathetic. Now we don't have to scratch our heads and realize why male adults act like their still in college and milk their party years till their 50. This film preys on an audience who is just out of touch with reality and cannot appreciate carefully constructed characters, witty and realistic dialogue and plausible friendships, because in this film these guys have anything but on-screen chemistry; it comes across as awkward and unnatural.</p></br><a href="../users/A2ULSA0IRUE09E.html">A2ULSA0IRUE09E</a><br/><p>"The Hangover" represents a sea of abysmal in an already belabored movie world, and for a variety of reasons. The audience I witnessed this with were rolling in the aisles, perceiving perhaps tons more than I possibly did - but the stark reality is that this is a motion picture that intends to shock and awe with its' series of gratuitous inappropriate gags, and for a large part these gags just do not work.<br /><br />The seemingly hilarious script seems contrived and ineffective, and the performances are decidedly one-note. That said, "The Hangover" represents a new low for cinema in general, only because the five star reviews from critics for this particular motion picture, are both unwarranted and misguided. Lead actor Bradley Cooper and Heather Graham have some of the most ludicrous situations to work with, but there isn't really any 'acting' going on, so to speak.<br /><br />Any scenes that involve humor directed upon and toward infants (in this case of a sexually suggestive nature) and seem to glorify and patronize infant violence is absolutely intolerable. Even with the ethical elements removed, these scenes weren't even that funny. Zach Galifianakis, who did exceptional work on `Tru Calling' is reduced to a slab of ridiculousness, and the celebrity guest roles do nothing for the enterprise.<br /><br />This was more like a collection of vignettes than an actual feature film. As both a commercial and critical venture, this is very far removed from what a comedy ought to be, and this is disappointing. Perhaps this says a lot about the state of our current audiences.<br /><br />Two Stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>In the current film market, the "guy picture" and the films of Tyler Perry are the two hottest sub-genres of comedy out there.  Thanks to Judd Apatow's smashing successes, the litany of comedies focusing on the trials and tribulations of young men teetering on the brink of manhood (even those well into their 30s) is impressive - "Knocked Up," "40-Year Old Virgin," "Wedding Crashers," "Superbad," "Pineapple Express," and on and on.<br /><br />Smashing through the pack is Todd Philips' "The Hangover."  There may not be a more classic setup for a buddy flick - a bachelor party in Vegas gone horribly wrong.  But I cannot think of a recent film that has taken a more stodgy premise and injected such brilliant and unexpected hilarity into the mix.<br /><br />We know from the first scene that things have gone wrong:  a bleeding guy stands in the middle of the desert, calmly explaining to a nervous bride-to-be that he's lost her fiance and the wedding ain't gonna happen.  We think, sure - we've seen this before.<br /><br />No we haven't.<br /><br />Cut to the guys getting ready to hit Vegas.  The fiance, Doug (Justin Bartha ("National Treasure") is a pretty good guy.  His two best friends are Stu (Ed Helms, "The Office") and Phil (Bradley Cooper, "Wedding Crashers").  Stu is a hen-pecked guy who's lied to his controlling girlfriend - she honestly thinks he's taking Doug to a bachelor party in Napa (serves her right).  Phil is a teacher frustrated by his job and his marriage and is just dying for a night of depravity.<br /><br />But there is a fourth guy along for the ride - Alan (Zach Galifianakis), the soon-to-be brother-in-law.  In a lesser movie, Alan would quite simply steal the whole shooting match.  Galifianakis combines the zaniness of John Belushi with the untrammelled sweet innocence of Michael Cera.  Alan is not quite right - starved for friendship, socially maladroit, and fanatically loyal.  The first sign of trouble comes when the guys agree to take shots from Alan's booze on top of a Vegas hotel/casino.<br /><br />The brilliance of the movie comes from the next scene - the guys wake up in a completely trashed hotel suite.  But there are signs of a true blowout - broken tables, a burning sofa, a baby in the closet and a tiger in the bathroom.  And a missing fiance.<br /><br />The rest of the movie involves Stu, Phil and Alan trying to track down Doug in Vegas even though nobody can remember a single thing from the night before.  The twists and turns involve Vegas crime lords, a sweet prostitute (Heather Graham), and Mike Freaking Tyson.<br /><br />This movie is hilarious from start to finish.  Fast moving, perfectly cast, and always unexpected, "The Hangover" benefits from perfect comic performances from the entire cast.  It's not a surprise to see either Ed Helms or Bradley Cooper in a hilarious movie, but to see Galifianakis graduate from "Out Cold" and various "Reno 911" episodes to the comic big time is a pure pleasure.<br /><br />Get this movie!</p></br><a href="../users/AEQFYOI6YJ83Z.html">AEQFYOI6YJ83Z</a><br/><p>I was skeptical about seeing The Hangover.  After all, the previews weren't that great, and I was unfamiliar with the cast.  But a friend of mine went to see it...then wanted to go see it again.  I've never known this guy to pay for a movie twice, so I was intrigued.  Could it be that could?<br /><br />It was.  The Hangover is perhaps the funniest film of 2009; arguably the funniest since Tropic Thunder.  The film follows four guys--Ed Helms, Bradley Cooper, and Zack Galifianakis--as they take their buddy on a road trip before his wedding...then promptly lose him one drunken night.  They wake up the next morning, their lives in a mess, their car missing, and a tiger in the bathroom.  What follows is comedic gold.<br /><br />All three leads are phenomenal, with near-perfect comedic timing.  Supporting roles from contemporary farce mainstays Ken Jeong and Rob Riggle help round things out, while Mike Tyson's cameo is pitch-perfect.  Todd Phillips, the director, also helmed Old School...which, while a funny movie, really shouldn't be compared to The Hangover.  I haven't see a comedy like this in ages.  I think you'll agree: for b*lls to the wall humor, The Hangover is worth every penny.</p></br><a href="../users/A3DGVB3T5QJNRE.html">A3DGVB3T5QJNRE</a><br/><p>I love humor, it's one of my favorite film genres.

Anyone who has ever experienced - or dealt with people who have been physically and/or sexually abused will probably feel a bit disturbed by seeing simulated sexual abuse, and calling it funny! I have to admit, I finally walked out of the theater because beside being depraved in a bad way the film was also desperately boring! I could care less about any of the main characters! And the humor was so unimaginative and forced!<br /><br />The film's trailers fooled me into thinking The Hangover would be worth checking out.

I paid heed to all the positive reviews it got and trusted friends and family of mine that described it as "hilarious", one going so far as to say that he couldn't remember the last time he'd laughed that hard watching a movie.  Based on all this positive reception, I expected to be doubled over and trying to catch my breath while watching "The Hangover" but I found myself chuckling only moderately and feeling a little letdown once the end credits rolled.  The movie will tickle some funny bones more than others but on a personal laugh scale of 1 to 5, I only rate it a 3 and I have to assume it is because I am not a bachelorette, party girl or Vegas enthusiast, and I have no interest of ever visiting the place.<br /><br />The movie centers around a young affianced guy named Doug (Bartha) and his three groomsmen that take a trip to Vegas for one wild night a few days before his impending nuptials.  Phil (Cooper), a married teacher with a son, Stu (Helms), a dentist, Alan (Galifianakis), Doug's dim-witted brother-in-law-to-be and the groom himself all book an expensive villa at Caesar's Palace and toast one another on the roof of the building before descending the stairs again for partying and debauchery.  When they wake up the next morning, the posh villa has been demolished - an armchair smolders in the main sitting area, food and drink are all over the place, a clucking chicken roams the halls and a tiger (yes, you read that right - a TIGER) has taken residence in the bathroom.  Waking up on the floor severely dazed and assessing the celebratory carnage around them, they notice Doug is missing from their small band and they immediately embark on a search for him, desperate to make it to LA for the wedding before it's too late.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is a puckish step-by-step of how all the mayhem transpired.  Along with the mysteries of the animals roaming the villa are Stu's missing tooth, Phil's hospital bracelet, a mattress on the roof of Caesar's Palace and a stolen cop car, not to mention everyone's curious amnesia.  When a date rape drug called rohypnol (aka "roofies") is found to be the culprit for their short-term memory loss, they exhaust every little lead they can to locate Doug, becoming impromptu detectives in the process, and wind up in much bigger predicaments than they all thought possible.  The film depends on these outlandish quandaries for its laughs and pulls out all the stops for a zany Vegas adventure, some of which include a quickie marriage to a stripper, a run-in with "Iron Mike" Tyson and a hostage situation in the desert.  The script (derived from a real life Vegas bender) relies on moderate amounts of profanity, sexual humor, nudity (I personally could've done without seeing Galifianakis's hairy, cellulite-ridden posterior), drugs/alcohol and the general lore of Sin City for its laughs.  It certainly doesn't help that it comes from screenwriters who are fairly young in their careers.  The end result is that it doesn't break any new ground in the comedy genre, despite its critical and box office success (it's grossed more than $277 million in the US and Canada as of December 2009).<br /><br />Helms (of "The Office" fame as Andy Bernard) plays the sensible guy of the bunch who acquiesces to his cold, stiff harpy of a girlfriend because he's too nice for his own good (you can hardly wait for her to get a comeuppance of some sort).  Cooper is the guy with a devil-may-care streak who is dissatisfied with the mediocrity of his life and Galifianakis is a big-hearted oddball who is just trying to belong.  Bartha doesn't get to stretch his legs much as Doug because of his absence from over half the film, his character just a conduit for the plot.  Heather Graham as a smokin' hot but kindly stripper named Jade comes off as a real sweetheart just looking for a connection with an honest man.<br /><br />Bottom line: Despite becoming the eighth-highest grossing film of 2009 so far and snagging a Golden Globe nomination for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, I'm overall not impressed with "The Hangover" and am glad I did not buy it before watching it.  Though I wouldn't have regretted it deeply, it still would've stung to spend $15 on a film that failed to conjure the side-splitting laughs I was so readily expecting.</p></br><a href="../users/A56AA52NMMKYQ.html">A56AA52NMMKYQ</a><br/><p>What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.<br /><br />I wish this movie had stayed in Vegas.<br /><br />Save 90 minutes of your life by doing something else.<br /><br />This story of a Vegas trip/bachelor party escape gone awry starts out promising, but spirals into unbelievable realms.<br /><br />Just watching it may give YOU a "bad movie" hangover ...</p></br><a href="../users/AMNNPDX9MFEUD.html">AMNNPDX9MFEUD</a><br/><p>The Hangover is funny but predictable and therefore is not a comedy classic (as so many fawningly throw out in their snippet reviews) unless your parameters are very narrow. The Hangover would easily offend a large majority of people (which I'm totally fine with, since the easily offended are often the biggest hypocrites) and it is as age intended as the Twilight series. Just as there are forty-something moms swooning over the teen romance in that mawkish series, there will be older guys guffawing and high-fiving their fave moments from this innocuous flick. But the target audiences for both are teens and twenty-somethings whose average cinematic experiences compel them to coin the utterly useless word "classic" and apply it to this movie. Compounding the problem is the excess hype that started nearly at the premiere. It just goes to show you how powerful media saturation can be.<br />In short, if you can imagine the highlights of the last five to ten years of movies from Will Ferrell, Seth Rogen, Judd Apatow, Ben Stiller, et al, you can pretty much predict where the laughs will come from.<br />Endorsing the Vegas theme to the extreme, The Hangover is all about a wild weekend with no consequences.

Only bad thing is they can't remember a damn thing and have to figure out what the heck happened.  This film is the perfect nightmare I've had most of my life that keeps me from going to Las Vegas.  Absurdity abounds and comedy is non-stop.  You can't help yourself and start laughing about fifteen minutes in, and then you just keep on laughing all the way to the end.

Some say of all time.<br /><br />I think going into it thinking it was going to be funny spoiled it for us.  If it had just been advertised as an action film or a mystery film we would have enjoyed it more.  It is rather like a mystery: you all know the basic set-up how three of the guys wake up hungover in a trashed luxury suite at Caesar's Palace with various odd things in place that shouldn't have been there (baby, tiger, chicken), and things are missing (Ed Helms' front tooth, the groom), and the plot is trying to figure out not "what's wrong with this picture" but basically how to make it right again.  I kept hoping that the groom would be dead, and that one of the groomsmen would snap to and remember he had killed him.  But that is partially because I dislike the actor Justin Bartha, I'm not saying the story would have been better.<br /><br />Yet in a way the movie was sort of like CRAZY HEART turned inside out.  CRAZY HEART had the same sort of basic plot (except it was just one guy waking up from a massive hangover that had lasted his whole life) attempting to mend things by going to AA and making amends to the child he has nearly lost.<br /><br />This story was more elaborate and had a few more laughs, but I have to say, Ed Helms is better in The Office, Bradley Cooper was better in Alias, and Zach G much better in Bored to Death on HBO.  As for Heather Graham, well, the movie doesn't seem to have done much for her career (while people laughed at Lindsay Lohan for turning it down), but maybe it's because Heather G. looks so strange here: oh, the miseries of bad plastic surgeons and playing a stripper slash escort while breastfeeding.  And yet, lots of people love the movie, maybe I'll watch it a second time, in Hell.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>I was reluctant to see this movie since I was indifferent to Todd Phillips previous comedy, "Old School", but I was pleasantly surprised when I found myself laughing at the antics and mishaps of these middle aged men who discover utter chaos when they find their Las Vegas hotel room ravaged and with wild animals. All the actors are fine but special mention should be made of Bradley Cooper formerly the swinest suitor of Rachel McAdams in "Wedding Crashers", who's superb here as the confused bachelor who's trying to make sense of the chaos. If you're depressed in these tough financial times--this comedy will bring you out of it.</p></br></body></html>

The problem was that I felt that I had left the world of the original film and entered a video game. The characters are all there but somehow they became Superman clones overnight. <p>What little of the plot there is becomes increasingly confusing due in large part to the fact that what the audience gets is half a movie. Maybe things will be revealed when the final chapter of the trilogy comes out in early November. As the movie opens the machines are drilling towards Zion and Neo must find a way to prevent this attack. We go through the usual machinations of surface plot: Neo must find and rescue the Keymaker who will show him the way to the door to the core of the Matrix where he will be forced to make a choice to save the world or to act in his own self interest.<p>For the most part however the film presents fight scene after fight scene each more elaborate and CGI created. While the wire-fu is interesting I get the feeling that I've seen it all before and don't really need to see it again. The centerpiece of the film is a freeway chase scene that seems to go on forever. The movie is not bad but in the whole is not as great as the sum of its parts.<p>The DVD I viewed presented a crisp picture and soundtrack. Credit once again must be given to director of photography Bill Pope and composer Don Davis. While the set boasted of many special features they really did not amount to much more than extended promotional materials. Particularly bad in this respect were &quot;The Matrix Unfolds&quot; and &quot;Enter the Matrix&quot; game promos. The usual making of feature &quot;Preload&quot; was worth a look and so was the detailed Freeway Chase Scene featurette if your interests are inclined that way. Perhaps the best part of the special features section was the spoof of the film for the MTV Movie Awards which is  presented in its entirety.<p>All in all woth a view but we're keeping our fingers crossed that the third chapter will be as great as the promise of the first film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSMQIF1C2VCE.html">A1NSMQIF1C2VCE</a><br/><p>Few things can kill a movie series like success.<p>Just as George Lucas' &quot;Star Wars&quot; films have gotten increasingly unwatchable, the sequel to &quot;The Matrix&quot; already shows that success, money and hype have successfully insulated the Brothers Wachowski from criticism or even the ability for someone around them to question &quot;why is this action sequence so long,&quot; &quot;why is there a Mad Max rave scene with Morpheus totally acting out of character,&quot; &quot;what is the point of the whole sequence with the Merovingian,&quot; or, most importantly, &quot;why would you go two hours of nothing but action and then dump all this philosophy and obscure information on audiences in the final 10 minutes?&quot;<p>It's especially frustrating because &quot;The Matrix&quot; had built up so much good will towards it that the brothers didn't need to pander to their audiences -- being just as smart as the first film wouldn't have been rejected by the audience, but instead, we get a vastly dumbed-down film that fails to wow, and certainly fails to elicit any enthusiasm for the third installment in the series.<p>There are worse films out there, but few that have so squandered their potential along the way.<p>Recommended only for the most diehard &quot;Matrix&quot; fans.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>- but that's about it.<br /><br />The big chase scene is exciting, and must have filled two scrapyards with the cars they trashed. The numerous fight scenes are well choreographed and wired. The visual style takes what worked in the original Matrix and took it a step beyond.<br /><br />But somehow, it was too much and not enough. The action scenes were technically outstanding, but just seemed to go on and on. A little more resolution, a little sooner would have worked a lot better for me. The invading electro-squid were great animation, but somehow incidental - something in the background, not quite connected to the action. The visual style took what originality there was in the original Matrix, and drove it well past anything that made sense.<br /><br />Most of all (or least of all) was the inflection infection that flattened every spoken line in the movie. It was quite an achievement to take actors as good as Fishburne and Moss, and turn their voices in to the verbal equivalent of typewritten text. As near as I could tell, the directors couldn't get any variation into Keanu Reeves's voice, but they could get it out of everyone else's so they did.<br /><br />It's showy, it's got action, it's got good effects. It just doesn't have the spirit that leaves me caring whether the heroes succeed or fail.<br /><br />And it does have an obvious come-on to a sequel. I guess the worst part is knowing that I'll probably watch that, too.<br /><br />//wiredweird</p></br><a href="../users/A2TDK8D4HEMUYW.html">A2TDK8D4HEMUYW</a><br/><p>I didn't quite know what to expect going into "The Matrix Reloaded," and I came out with mixed feelings. This is a sequel to the 1999 film that enthralled audiences. I was a bit underwhelmed by the original, and so I figured the sequel would either be better given my disappointment in the first, or even worse. There's no doubt it's a good film, but it has some very bleak, almost corny scenes with long, metaphorical speeches. There is either too much or too little thought put into this film.<p>It takes place, supposedly, a few days after the original. Neo can fly, Trinity wears tighter and shinier leather costumes, and Morpheus is fatter. Neo dreams that Trinity dies in the opening sequence. Then back in Zion they realize that 250,000 sentinals are digging their way into Zion. In order to stop something they need something that does something which involves, though does not limit to, (...), kissing Persephone (Monica Belluci), rescuing a Keymaker, having a long car chase, beating up people, cloning Unleashed Agent Smiths (who appears not nearly as often as the trailer would lead you to believe), and blowing up things.<p>This film's plot goes to waste very quickly and so it falls back on special effects. They're great, yes, but not very different from all the "Matrix"-rip-off films we've been getting since the original. The beginning sequence wows the audience with terrific special effects, but later in the film they must have run short on their budget because Neo's fight with the million Agent Smiths (...) Either one works.<p>(...)"The Matrix Reloaded" really only has some good action scenes, which includes a highway chase atop of cars, trucks, motercycles and more, that goes on and on for seventeen minutes. Action fans will eat it up.<p>But it's not exactly the smartest of films. It thinks it's really smart, it tries to prove it, but scenes like that with "The Architect" (NOT the Archeologist) prove the movie is out of ideas. It tries to continue the smartness and freshness of the first film and tries to have revelations, but they confused me because the film moved through all the plot scenes too quickly so they could return to the action. Maybe they will be all sorted out in "The Matrix Revolutions," which opens in November. I certainly hope so.<p>"The Matrix" may not have been one of my favorite films but I did like it to a certain degree. It seemed pretty smart and a breakthrough achievment in special effects. It targeted all filmgoers - from sci-fi to action to drama to romance - whereas "The Matrix Reloaded" really only targets two audiences - die-hard fans of the original and sci-fi-lovers. That's probably one of its biggest of many flaws.<p>But it is still a pretty good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1UNJ46NSB352E.html">A1UNJ46NSB352E</a><br/><p>It's amazing how one's perception can change the second time through a movie.  The Matrix Reloaded got better.  Keanu's easy-going acting style is perfect for the role of Neo, and Laurence Fishburne is just plain awesome as Morpheus (even if he did put on a few extra pounds).  This movie has everything you could ask for; a plot you have to think about, great action sequences, one of the best Dolby mixes ever, and Jada Pinkett Smith.  The special features are terrific.<p>I highly recommend this DVD.</p></br><a href="../users/A2TAPL67U2A5HM.html">A2TAPL67U2A5HM</a><br/><p>The Matrix Reloaded (Widescreen Edition) is the 2003 sequel to Matrix and is just as good. The storyline is very intelligently written and raises many ethical and philosophical questions. Science fiction films that it can be compared with are Brazil and Blade Runner. The special effects are tremendous and Kenau Reeves is great in the role as Neo. The soundtrack is uneven with some tracks being great and some so so. I can not wait to see the final and concluding part of the amazing Matrix series. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.</p></br><a href="../users/A20EEWWSFMZ1PN.html">A20EEWWSFMZ1PN</a><br/><p>Once again the graphics outstretched the story, and for this day and age the CGI did not exceed that of most movies.  The continuing saga of the movie requires that you have seen the first one to get the proper background information.  As with Keanu Reeves' portrayal of Siddhartha in "Little Buddha" (1994), this time a change of costume and he must deal with impermanence and the Vedic cycles.  Super imposed on this gem of understanding is excessive action that would rival that of "Kung Pow!  Enter the Fist" (2002).<br /><br />Neo is supposed to be "The One" according to prophecy.  According to Morpheus he is to lead the people out of bondage.<br /><br />Is the oracle what she appears to be?<br /><br />Will Neo, in the midst of endless kicking and shooting, go on to fulfill his destiny?<br /><br />Or will the love of Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) interfere?<br /><br />This story is not so comprehensive. It needs to be viewed as part of the series to make it worth viewing.</p></br><a href="../users/AWG2O9C42XW5G.html">AWG2O9C42XW5G</a><br/><p>this movie is awesome and action packed with awesome special effects. the matrix is an awesome series. this one is a must see</p></br><a href="../users/A38UHOCEKSUOSP.html">A38UHOCEKSUOSP</a><br/><p>The Matrix Reloaded has one thing that simply stands out throughout the movie - complete eye candy.  Its true, while the first Matrix brought about new origins in movie animation and cgi, Matrix Reloaded takes it x100.  The action is amazing, it will blow you away almost to the point that you've had enough.  Major action and visual effects fans will dig this.  True harcorde fans of the Matrix story might be dissapointed.<br /><br />The story almost takes a backseat to the action.  The plot is dragged out throughout huge action scenes that seem to never end -  example-  Neo vs dozens of Smiths lasting forever, and the highway chase that lasts as long as I-95 runs.  While these scenes are truly spectacular, they take away from the story somewhat.  Gone is the great in depth exploration into the Matrix.  Very little is newly introduced to us about the Matrix, and the story now focuses on Neo and the rest of humanity saving itself from destruction, both from the machines in the real world, and Smith in the Matrix world.  We do get to meet the architect of the Matrix, though not as astounding as one would think.<br /><br />Overall this is not as good as the first one, but you'll still want to see it to see how the trilogy continues.  If you love never-ending action and cgi, you will want to watch this over and over and over.  The movie is worth buying on that regard.  As for a compeleing story, you might be ok stopping after the first Matrix and being satisfied.  If you do see Reloaded, you'll have to see Revolutions too, since both technically are one big film split into 2 parts.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M1NNDD95HR0R.html">A3M1NNDD95HR0R</a><br/><p>The effects and fight scenes are amped up this time around, matching the impressive level of its predecessor.  For instance, Trinity on that black Ducati sportbike!  She RULED!  Don't try that at home kids...  But let's not leave Neo out.  That one fight scene where Neo uses the sign post as a Bo staff and lets loose on like 100 agents at once!  BAM!  How about them apples?  I am a big fan of the Matrix trilogy.  In fact, the first one is my favorite movie.  But even so, in many ways Reloaded is equally good.  I recommend you get all 3 movies.  They are really hot titles, and their replay value is high.  Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A1JH5J1KQAUBMP.html">A1JH5J1KQAUBMP</a><br/><p>The Machines are drilling their way to Zion, last bastion of the human race, and the humans are preparing their final defense.  Not everyone accepts Morpheus' (Lawrence Fishburne) belief that Neo (Keanu Reeves) is the key to their salvation, so the crew of the Nebuchanezzar (spelling?) are on their own (in the beginning, anyway) as they reinsert themselves into the Matrix in search of Neo's final destiny.<br /><br />Pay no attention to the nay-sayers.  This film is lots of fun.  I enjoyed the pseudo-philosophical speechifying on the nature of reality between spectacular CGI-loaded [scenes].  The Wachowski brothers have taken a lot of trouble to flesh out the world of the Matrix and polish it with a veneer of intellectual significance.  You can think about it exactly as much as you want to; I'm sure the Wachowskis had something coherent in mind when they were writing all those speeches, and repeated viewing may bring clarity.  Or you can just sit back and enjoy the ground-breaking special effects sequences with the sound turned way up./</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director: Larry Wachowski, Andy Wachowski<br />Cast:  Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Jada Pinkett.<br />Running Time:  132 minutes.<br />Rated R for violence, language, and mild sexual situations.<p>When "The Matrix" hit the big screen in 1999, it was the most innovative special effects triumph Hollywood had ever produced.  With the sequel, "The Matrix Reloaded", the Wachowski brothers have actually succeeded in making a second film in the series that is just as exciting, equally as thought-provoking, and perhaps possessing even better special effects.  Can anyone say "The Empire Strikes Back"?<p>"The Matrix Reloaded" takes the audience through a roller-coaster ride from the last-standing city of civilization in Zion to the Matrix, which is a computerized database consisting of humans who are programmed to fuel its very existence.  As the Matrix strives to become more powerful and absolutely take over Earth, Zion attempts to stage war against the evil technological machine empire, using the messiah-like Neo (Reeves) as their catalyst.  What ensues is a spectacle of rip-roaring sequences of more kung-fu fighting than a Bruce Lee movie, a twelve-minute highway chase scene that perhaps may be the best action scene ever produced, and several superb battles between Neo and the evil Mr. Smith.<p>There a few portions of the narrative that seem to be illegitimate, such as the possible love story between Morpheus (Fishburne) and a previous interest played by Jada Pinkett's character, as well as the overused metaphor of love, specifically between Neo and Trinity (played by Moss).  While "Reloaded" does not suffer from these developed themes, they seem to provide a symbolism that the Wachowski brothers are trying to convey, but they are so wrapped up in showing off their CCI effects that they are lost for exactly what they want to show the audience.  What made the original "Matrix" so captivating was the expectance of the unexpected, while what makes "Reloaded" so enjoyable is that we get what we expect, and it is thrown at us like an asteroid colliding with earth.</p></br><a href="../users/A2QQHIY23PL7H3.html">A2QQHIY23PL7H3</a><br/><p>When The Matrix Reloaded first came out I really didn't like it. However, now that I've seen it on DVD a few times, I can honestly say I like it a lot better. It still feels like half a film, the action sequences still seem kind of pointless, and it lacks the punch and innovation of the original - but as long as you're prepared and know where everything is leading and how this chapter in the Matrix saga ends, it all seems to flow and overall work a lot better than it really should. The thought puzzles surrounding &quot;choice&quot; and &quot;free will&quot; are still good for a ponder, even if they haven't been as nicely integrated as the philosphy in the original. It also helps to have seen The Matrix Revolutions, which should really be viewed as one combined film with Reloaded.<p>Normally I give DVDs another star if the extras add value to the overall package, but there's not that much extra stuff here. You get the funny MTV awards spoof and a good documentary on the freeway chase, but everything else feels promotional. There's also something funny about the audio-mixing too; music is cranked up while speech is softer than it should be. Overall it's a competent DVD, but there's supposed to be a much better box set coming soon. As for the movie, it's still flawed but gets better with repeat viewings.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EJYJC25OJVKK.html">A3EJYJC25OJVKK</a><br/><p>1999's "The Matrix" was and still remains one of the greatest groundbreaking science fiction movies that came out in a very long time in my opinion. <p> The second part of the three part Matrix trilogy "The Matrix Reloaded" brilliantly follows up on the original even though it can go overboard in places and even speed on very bumpy roads from time to time. This movie feels a lot different from the original, being a lot darker and having a very `green' tint to much of the movie but perhaps it's due to the cover art and the theatrical posters during the movie's release. This is in my opinion, one of 2003's best movies.<p> In the case of "Reloaded" Neo begins to realize that he has only 3 days to rally up the remaining human population and defend Zion, their last refuge from being taken over by renegade machines being controlled by a renegade program called Agent Smith who has the ability to replicate himself and spread his power all over the Matrix. Time is running out and Neo has only 3 days to save the remainder of humanity from falling prey to the intelligent machines that are run by the replicating renegade program Agent Smith. Accoring to the philosophy, Neo is in fact, Agent Smith's equal that is the `one' who can save humanity from a fate worse than death. For some older audiences, this movie may come close to being something that came from "The Terminator" movie series and yes, I can see a lot of similarities between Matrix and Terminator in terms of man versus machine. <p> This movie is a really excellent follow-up to the 1999 original Matrix movie but there are some areas where it can get a bit out of hand. While many movies seem to suffer from a lack of a good plot or one that never takes off at all, "The Matrix Reloaded" is the opposite where the plot goes way over the top and jumps too much between stories and goes all over the place without allowing some time to rest. In some ways, I feel that "Reloaded" has been rendered almost obsolete because it ends with a cliffhanger note almost abruptly and "Revolutions" is where the real fun begins. That doesn't mean that "Reloaded" is no longer necessary but I feel that they could easily have made "Reloaded" and "Revolutions" into one four hour movie and the final two movies in the Matrix series created more questions than answered others. The one thing that I felt was completely unnecessary was a scene between Neo and Trinity. While I am not bothered that much by such material, I felt the lovemaking scene just cluttered up the film. Sorry, no offense but I felt it cluttered up the film. <p> I know that Keanu Reeves as Neo is the foreground character and he does great in playing Neo but Hugo Weaving who gave us Elrond from Lord of The Rings, steals the spotlight away from everyone else in this film. Upon seeing the scary and unsettling character Agent Smith, I have to say that Weaving can play some REALLY scary bad guys and is totally awesome and engaging in this movie. I could almost forget about everyone else in the movie's cast because Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith is one of the most awesome characters in this movie despite the fact that he's the arch villain. <p> The second disc though is a real treat. You can see a lot of footage of how several of the various scenes are created and see the behind the scenes footage of the epic highway chase scenes. You won't believe how they made the highway chase scene. I'm not going to tell you how they did but you will be amazed at how they did it. I was like "WOW!" when I watched the part of filming the epic highway battle scenes. It's absolutely amazing! Then you got a lot of interviews with the actors and seeing how they filmed a lot of the various acting sequences, typical of most DVDs but the "Matrix Reloaded" DVD is definitely one to check out just for disc two. <p> The special effects are absolutely amazing and groundbreaking, even by a lot of today's standards. The various martial combat, fight scenes and chase scenes are incredibly choreographed and tons and tons of fun to watch. I'll admit, the CGI effects can start to get out of hand in some places but for the most part, the visuals are just amazing to watch! I haven't seen special effects that actually were efficiently done so well since Bruce Willis' "The Fifth Element" from seamingly entire lifetimes ago. <p> This movie is no masterpiece by any means, nor surpasses it's original 1999 predecessor and suffers from being a very confusing movie but if you can bypass the flaws, then "Matrix Reloaded" is a must-see movie and worth renting many times over and succeeds in many ways that a lot of sequels fail at: living up the original. I say renting as opposed to buying because I'm just waiting for a possible box set or something like "The Matrix Trilogy" or some box set containing all three movies in one because even though the final movie "Revolutions" left me wanting a lot more, this trilogy was very well done and is a great achievement in Sci-Fi History.<p> The Waschowski Brothers have done a great job of creating an unforgettable movie legacy with these three movies. I give this movie about a Grade A-.</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>In Matrix Reloaded the struggle for mankind continues where Neo (Keanu Reeves) has been elevated to a more divine position by Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and his followers.  This time they are short on time, since they only have 72 hours until a massive number of probes will reach the underground city of Zion.  Before this Neo must get into the Matrix where some strange occurrences have been observed by the crew on the Nebuchadnezzar, the hovercraft, which leads to some visually stunning scenes.  In the Matrix Neo seeks out the Oracle in order to find some answers to some questions that they have; however, the answers lead to further questions which turn into a maze of problems.  Matrix Reloaded uses some amazing special effects that cost a fortune to produce, however, the beginning of the film has some troubling transitions and scenes that causes awkwardness in the storyline.  These clumsy cinematic moments are temporarily saved by the special effects, but in the long run the film suffers from a cinematically congested introduction that is full of inelegant transitions between scenes and characters. In the end, the audience is presented with a story that offers some valuable lessons and quick paced entertainment, but it does not measure up with the forerunning story.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EBHHCZO6V2A4.html">A3EBHHCZO6V2A4</a><br/><p>"The Matrix" was an innovative,thought-provoking movie. It had a Buddhist/Christian allegory with the "Chosen One",Neo being "awakened" (like Buddha) to the reality of existence and being "resurrected" (like Jesus) through Trinity's kiss. It's an enjoyable,rip-roaring film.<br /><br />"Matrix Reloaded",on the other hand,is a major letdown. It has the special effects,the same trio of heroes (Neo,Trinity,Morpheus)..but lacks its soul. The spirituality of the first has been replaced with "look what we can do now." The heroic trio confronts the Merovignian (a legendary descendant of Jesus and Mary Magdalene),his cleavage-baring wife Persephone,as well as the albino Twins. These new villains are incredibly confusing,and don't have any basis in the first movie. Why do they even exist? As an excuse for fight scenes? At least Hugo Weaving returns as the only engaging villain,Agent Smith.<br /><br />There's a pointless orgy/rave scene in Zion that's supposed to be life-affirming. One expects to see Nelly Furtado emerging from the shadows to belt out "Maneater",but that's a FUN video,and a better song. Neo and Trinity have an unerotic consummation scene. It could've been incredibly sensual and romantic;but the leads lack chemistry. Perhaps the Wachowskis should've left the Neo/Trinity love scene to the imaginations of the viewers.<br /><br />"Matrix Reloaded" has some amazing visuals, especially at the end when Neo confronts the architect of the Matrix surrounded by TV monitors. The battle scenes,as always,are spectacles. Unfortunately,the human and mystical sides of the story are significantly absent.</p></br><a href="../users/AQ01Q3070LT29.html">AQ01Q3070LT29</a><br/><p>DVD will play movie if option has not been chosen in nearly 2 minutes.<br />  The Matrix Reloaded is the second film in this trilogy.

I thought it was a different offering in a see of bad movies.  It had a fairly interesting plot and okay acting (except for Keanu).  They should have kept it at one Matrix and not make anymore.  But cash cows being what they are this movie was made.<br />Anyways, the action scenes in this movie were okay for the most part but can we come up with something other than the slow motion animation that is now so prevelant?  It was relatively fresh in the first one, now it is getting stale.  Another thing, why the scene with the infinite Agent Smiths?  I thought it was cool at first but dragged on too long.  And then the dialogue, gah.  I don't like Star Trek because of all the meaningless Technobabble and this stuff made Star Trek look exciting.  About the only scene I really liked was the restaurant.<br />However the thing that bugged me most was the abrupt "ending".  I realize this was because they were releasing Revolutions in November (or so they same).  It seems more like like they can make double the revenue if they release it as two movies instead of one.  So now that they've got this precedent, more movies will be released like this.  But then again, this was a 90 minute movie that seemed like 900 minutes, so I don't think I could take the full 3 hours worth of movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>Contrary to popular opinion, I found this version better than the 1st part, better sci fi really.  What is so good about this film is that a lot is added, but not too much:  you get intimations of deeper things that can stimulate the imagination without laying it all out, which would stretch credibility too far.  I love the way the references are somewhat obscure and cryptic.  The actions scenes are also extremely good, while different from the 1st one.  And the acting, well, even Keanu Reeves - who is my book is a 2nd-rater - is excellent.  Taken together, this is the best sci-fi film I have seen in years.</p></br><a href="../users/A140XH16IKR4B0.html">A140XH16IKR4B0</a><br/><p>What a shame that this second release in the Matrix trilogy couldn't continue to deliver on the manic and original fun of the first. To be honest, I only watched the first hour, I was so bored by the weird semi-religious nonsense and the tiresome delivery of pompous dialog and the repetitious stunts that I never developed enough interest to see the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Only for the true devotee.</p></br><a href="../users/A1GHUN5HXMHZ89.html">A1GHUN5HXMHZ89</a><br/><p>I'm not sure I understand the confusion and disappointment expressed by some. As in most trilogies the second movie is often dark and does not reveal all the answers. Look at The Empire Strikes Back, Back to the Future 2, Temple of Doom, Two Towers, or most second films in trilogies.<p><p>Here we find Neo is torn by a personal conflict about Trinity and a vision he has of what will happen to her. When he meets various programmers he begins to understand the complexities and consequences of the programs on the matrix. When he finally meets the creator of the matrix he must decide if he will save the people of Zion or Trinity.<p><p>Any fan of SciFi movies should enjoy this movie. The character development may not be as deep as the first movie but the story development is the key here and takes some close examination to follow.<p><p>I think the movie did a good job of preparing us for the final conflict that will take place in the third movie being released November 11th. The DVD has sharp picture and sound and a number of extras including commentary, documentary and more.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AXHNRDJEQ0B.html">A1AXHNRDJEQ0B</a><br/><p>In many movies that have extensive special effects (mostly sci fi movies), anyone can question whether the SF are there to enhance the art of movie making, or whether the movie is there to showcase the art of SF. In George Liucas' &quot;Start Wars&quot; films, the latter is correct, while in Peter Jackson's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, the former is.<p>The original Matrix film also belonged to the former. I feel that many other viewers, like me, were expecting Matrix Reloaded to be more of the same. If so - we were all sorely disappointed. There are some new ideas and plot twists, and some cheesy philosophy about choices and understanding our motives for making them (therefore I give this movie 2 stars), but it is almost hidden behind too much SF and too many over elaborate fight scenes. Granted, this had also existed in the first Matrix. Why am I objecting now? Lets take the fight scenes, for instance. In the first movie, they came to demonstrate to ability to bend rules we thought were un - bendable. Making lots of copies of Agent Smith fight Neo seemed to have little point but the show the movie makers' ability to create this sort of scene.</p></br><a href="../users/A1Q15TP2FXYYMF.html">A1Q15TP2FXYYMF</a><br/><p>Matrix reloaded is a brilliant film. I'm hearing alot of bad reports about it and its pi***ng me off because its a brilliant film. The film is about NEO (Keanu Reeves) must complete the prophecy that Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne) believes in to save the world. The effects, martial arts, action and stunt scenes in this film are amazing. Whenever he has to fight all the agent smiths is a pretty cool scene. Whenever the film starts off with trinity jumping off a bike in mid air and sending the bike into a security hut and then the security hut explodes the film has you completely hooked!<br /><br />The freeway scene in this film has you absolutely gob smacked! Whenever neo has to talk to the architect this part of the film is a real brain teaser. The explosions in this film are quality. I think that reloaded is as good as the first film. A lot of people would disagree with me because alot of people I know that have seen this either don't like it or just thinks its ok. Well I think its brilliant and I definitely recommend it.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OLJM7IREKPWZ.html">A2OLJM7IREKPWZ</a><br/><p>The Wachowski brothers are amazing in this sequal<br /><br />just as much wicked action as the first<br /><br />more romance added<br /><br />more tender shots<br /><br />more creepiness<br /><br />more action<br /><br />more twists<br /><br />more everything<br /><br />I got this on dvd and shall watch it again and again and again<br /><br />the sequal could never let me down<br /><br />it's just as hardcore as the first Matrix<br /><br />amazing follow up guys</p></br><a href="../users/A2JHHYYOOO4DS6.html">A2JHHYYOOO4DS6</a><br/><p>Truly stunning visual effect.

It's a flaw that occurs when I like something, but not quite enough to wait in lines at theaters or reserve copies at a rental store when I'm never quite sure of my schedule.  The Matrix falls into that category, very well done and imaginative, no doubt, but it didn't stir me enough to rush to see the sequels.<br /><br />Now I've seen Reloaded, and I continue to be impressed, not so much by the raw imagination of Matrix, but by it's ability to skirt the obvious paradigms that the viewer expects and hare off instead in entirely new directions.  Of course, the wild chases and fight scenes are here in all their glory.  At a certain point, they actually become abstract and tedious extravaganzas.  The Wachowski's put everything they can into Neo's acrobatics, coming closer and closer to a bloodbath that never actually happens.  Unfortunately this means stretching them out until they cry for editing.<br /><br />In spite of all this showmanship, it is the plot and characters that really make this film.  Neo struggles to discover what he needs to do Morpheus seeks after the Oracle, and a whirl of voice enhance characters sweep across the screen like Dune revisited.  New characters like Merovingian and Persephone liven things up.  And Agent Smith turns into a cast of thousands all by himself.<br /><br />Doom is descending to destroy Zion, and Neo must decide what is important, what is real, what is maze, and what is purpose.  Zion itself comes to life beautifully, and we finally get an understanding of how this culture of rebels really works.  My only irritation is that the film ends in a total cliffhanger, which somehow smacks of cheating.  I mean, I would have gotten to Matrix Revolutions sooner or later anyway.</p></br><a href="../users/A1TKM36EYEQNSM.html">A1TKM36EYEQNSM</a><br/><p>Taking the original matrix one step further and deeper.  Seeing the inner workings of Zion was exciting.  A little too sexual in places, that was a surprise, even a rave party of sorts.  <p>Not as good as the original, but it definately had some very interesting concepts.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>How do you top a global phenomenon? Easy, make 2. The Wachowski Brothers(directors) and Joel Silver(producer) first blew people's minds with 1999's the Matrix.  It really was something nobody had seen before. So to top it they went over the top, and possibly a little overboard.<p>Neo, now the One, and Trinity are lovers now and he keeps having nightmares of her.  In the middle of this, sentinels(those big bug-like things at the end of the first one) have been dispatched to destroy Zion, the last city on Earth and Neo and Co. are giving very little time to do so.  So Neo goes here and there getting answers and stopping the machines.<p>The problem with this? You can obviously see Silver and the Wachowskis took their budget and used it a lot on special effects.  Remember how in the Matrix the bullet time effect really only rotated around the central screen? Now it's going all over the place.  Remember Neo's brief but sweet fight against Smith in the subway? Well now he's facing 100 of them. Therein lies the problem: waaaaaaay too much.  More fights, more longer fights and more &quot;dazzling&quot; effects, and they do dazzle. But then they go.....and go......and go...... and so on.<p>Despite story shortcomings and an obvious penchant for bigger effects and fights, those fights are rather awesome to watch, seeing Neo doing all these inhuman acrobatics you wish you could do.  Well, a good thing about this movie despite the fights?  You know Revolutions has gotta be better than this</p></br><a href="../users/A3GKPMHV4U64IY.html">A3GKPMHV4U64IY</a><br/><p>At the end of the first movie, Neo became The One.  Now he is legendary amongst the free humans and the city of Zion.<br /><br />But what is The One really?  Who is the Oracle and why is she allowed to exist?  That is the main thrust of this chapter of the Matrix saga.<br /><br />But no quest is simple.  Agent Smith has brand new abilities thanks to his defeat by Neo in the first movie.  No longer is he a simple enforcement program.  Now he is more like a virus, able to overwrite his code onto others.<br /><br />So we have Neo's quest to find out what he is, the new threat from Smith, and of course the machines are stepping up their efforts to wipe out the free humans.  Quite a lot for a movie that some feel is just a bunch of special effects.<br /><br />But this movie is not just special effects.  The answered questions go a long way to making this chapter make far more sense than the first.  The setting is some time after the first movie and it would be nice to know a little more about what went on during that time but the revelation of Zion helps to make up for it.<br /><br />All in all this is a very good sequel although the true movie was too long and it was split into two pieces.  This means that this chapter ends a little abruptly and you might want to have the next chapter available before you watch this one.</p></br><a href="../users/A3GQKB1KF0CRPE.html">A3GQKB1KF0CRPE</a><br/><p>If you disengage your brain you might enjoy Elrond of Rivendale by case attacking Neo in his Priest's get up, but by the time, you are skirting dangerous toward brain burnout!  I have watched it several times, thinking maybe it was the mood I was in, but nope.  Matrix was a mind-blowing one-trick-pony that just did not stretch into to a second movie well.  There are a lot of interesting scenes, but Neo aka up up and away, just brought a giggle out in me.  The LONG action sequences make you want to go okay, enough!  Less is More is NOT the banner of this movie! After Neo b**** slap's Elrond and his brother Elrond and his other brother Elrond 100 times it just redefines redundant.  Then Neo reaching in to pull out the magic bullet...oh, please...sigh...and the religious overtones are so pretensious.<p>It was good to see Anthony Zerbe a long under rated talent get a nice spot.  The effect are good, just overdone ad nauseoum.  Elrond take the ship to into the West quickly!</p></br><a href="../users/AP3B615GM191G.html">AP3B615GM191G</a><br/><p>After being absolutely blown away by the original "Matrix" film, I was expecting much of the same the second time around.  Unfortunately, that is EXACTLY what happened...albeit too much.<br /><br />The major appeal of the first film was that the complex story was put into terms that, while sometimes complicated, most people could still understand.  "Reloaded", however, ratchets that level of difficulty in understanding the subject material into the stratosphere, as characters expounded on the notions of "rogue computer programs", "choice", and "free will".  Far too many times I felt as if I needed undergraduate degrees in philosophy and computer science to understand what the heck was going on!<br /><br />The other readily-apparent flaw in this film was its overuse of action scenes.  The first film provided just the right combination of talk vs. action that made the showdown with Agent Smith all the more enjoyable.  "Reloaded" throws scene after scene of intense martial arts at you, in the process making those scenes a whole lot less unique and thrilling.  Plus, the scenes are often so over-the top (where it is too obvious for a major motion picture that high-tech computers are used to shoot the entire scene) that the entire film has a fake feel to it.<br /><br />With those major critiques out of the way, however, the film did have its bright spots.  For me, the experience of watching this film can be summed up by Neo's meeting with "The Architect"...though I was fascinated but what was being said, I could only comprehend every third or fourth concept due to the highly-complicated nature of the subject matter.  Like I said, one must be almost professionally versed in philosophy and computer programming to know exactly what is transpiring.<br /><br />Overall, then, I would recommend this film to all the hard-core computer programming nerds out there that will be absolutely fascinated by its musings.  For the more casual science fiction viewer, however, just try to comprehend as much as you can and wait for the big conclusion coming in the third film.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LSDDSM4PGOU5.html">A1LSDDSM4PGOU5</a><br/><p>this is the second movie in the Matrix saga.it chronicles the<br />continuing fight of the resistance to free humanity from continuing<br />enslavement from the machines which keep reality hidden from them.this<br />is not what i would call good movie.it is a collection of repetitive<br />and ridiculous unrealistic fight scenes,coupled with an incoherent<br />storyline.plus there a lot of 'profound' sayings which aren't really<br />profound at all.then you have characters speaking in riddles which are<br />gibberish half the time.at time,i felt i was being preached a<br />philosophy lesson.My vote for The Matrix Reloaded is a 2/5</p></br><a href="../users/A1R602SXNGOMJ4.html">A1R602SXNGOMJ4</a><br/><p>Six months after the original Matrix, Neo (Keanu Reeves)begins to have nightmares about Trinity(Carrie-Anne Moss)plunging to her death. Meanwhile, the rebels have returned to the city of Zion to learn that 250,000 sentinels are digging towards them in order to seek Zion and wipe out the human resistance. The Oracle gives Neo instructions to find the keymaker and seek out the source. If Neo fails the mission, the rebellion will be crushed and the machines will win the war.<br />I've seen some bad movies, but this one was terrible.</p></br><a href="../users/AV5G37VFE5NVD.html">AV5G37VFE5NVD</a><br/><p>Neo flies.  Trinity dies.  Morpheus cries (almost).  These are just three of the many scenes of The Wachowski Brothers' "The Matrix Reloaded", one of the most anticipated sequels of the last decade.  <p>The film begins with Neo, played by Keanu Reeves.  Neo is plagued by nightmares involving the death of lover Trinity (Carrie Anne-Moss).  He believes he is seeing the near future.  After a few neat CGI-filled scenes that show that to us, we find Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) (the latter of whom is being ridiculed by some fellow humans for belief in "The Prophecy") on their way home to Zion.  There they learn that the amount of sentinels has increased greatly.  The war is coming, or so we are told.<p>Morpheus meets with his rival, stern Commander Lock (Harry Lennix).  The two are constant competitors after Lock stole Morpheus' love, Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith).  They fight about what to do, what's coming, and what to believe.<p>So do we.  With "Reloaded", what began as a single successful film becomes an updated "Star Wars"-esque trilogy, with a seemingly unbeatable first film, a middle piece, and a battle-filled climax.  Many watchers will be put off from this film's lack of progression storywise, but that's meant to be.  It's the centerpiece for the story, and it's unfortunately quite hard to do much with the centerpiece ("The Empire Strikes Back" still wows me).<p>What Andy and Larry have done is left open our questions from the first film.  Oh yeah, they added some new ones too.  And I get the feeling "Revolutions" doesn't clear them up either.  Ugh.<p>"Reloaded" is every bit as entertaining as the original film, if not a little more confusing at times.  There's enough action and excitement to keep anyone in their seats - especially the scene around the end of the picture, in which Morpheus and Trinity struggle to keep the Keymaker out of reach of The Twins and/or the Agents.  And, all of this occurs on what's got to be the most realistically vicious freeway I've ever seen.<p>One thing that I deemed unnecessary was the amount of sexuality.  There was a fair amount of sexuality (including nudity) and too much sappiness throughout the film.  Carrie Anne-Moss and Keanu Reeves making out?  I don't know about you, but that's not my idea of a good time.  Generally, things like this occur when the previously careful directors become more comfortable and popular ... which isn't always a bad thing.<p>The CGI animation is spectacular.  There's a slight drop in martial arts action from the first film, but the action sequences here are really fun.  Of course, they're accompanied by another great punk/metal/rock soundtrack and a fast-paced score from Don Davis.<p>One last note: Neo flies.  Yep, he flies.  As one of the Nebachudnezzar's crew puts it, "Uh-oh - he's doin' the Superman thing again."  This happens about three times throughout the film, and while it does have a sort of cheesy and annoying feeling to it, I can't help myself but to find it fun.  And funny.<p>Overall, "The Matrix Reloaded" comes nowhere near being as good as its predecessor, but it's a fun time at the movies, and definitely a recommended watch.  This series is getting better and better.  Now for "Revolutions".</p></br><a href="../users/AUDSM2CTLLW1Q.html">AUDSM2CTLLW1Q</a><br/><p>The task of following up a blockbuster, genre-defining film with a sequel is no easy task.  It is even harder when production delays and on-set tragedies push the release of that sequel from two years to four years after the original.  Faced with the pressure of expectations that are only exceeded by those that the "Star Wars" prequels endured, "The Matrix: Reloaded" more or less is successful in continuing the momentum of its predecessor.  While the awe of discovery and imagination is not present here (and couldn't be after the first movie), "Reloaded" still manages to pack eye-popping actions scenes with mind-bending philosophy, without getting too hampered by the incompleteness that plagues most `middle' films.<br /><br />"The Matrix: Reloaded" takes place at an unspecified time after the events of the first movie.  Emboldened by Neo's (Keanu Reaves) victory against the agents in the first film, the first of any kind for the humans against the machines, the emancipated humans have been stepping up there actions against the machines, freeing more enslaved humans and creating a definite perceived threat to the existence of the machines.  Striking from the home base of Zion, near the center of the Earth, the humans have faith, thanks to Neo's presence and exploits, that the war is theirs to win.  Of course, the machines, sensing that they must make a final strike to eradicate the human threat, have sent a huge arsenal of sentinels boring towards Zion with the single missions of extermination.  Will Neo be able to save humanity from this threat?  That question will not answered here (it is saved for the third part of the trilogy, "The Matrix: Revolutions"), but the actions that will set in motion that climax are presented in "Reloaded" and are quite compelling.<br /><br />In "The Matrix: Reloaded", almost all of the characters who survived the first movie have returned.  Neo, of course, is back, as well as his lover, Trinity, along with Morpheus.  The absence of Tank (who did survive the original), however, is both jarring and barely explained.  As the Matrix was introduced to audiences in the first film, so is the city of Zion and its inhabitants introduced to all in this film.  There are many new characters added to the mix, which are too numerous to list here.  Some of the new characters are very entertaining, although almost none of them qualify as `good guys'.  The two twins who do battle with Neo in the Matrix provide some skilled martial arts action.  The always-gorgeous Monica Bellucci glows in an all-too-short cameo as Persephone.  The true enigmatic addition is that of the double-talking Frenchman, Merovingian.  It's not quite clear what he is or where his loyalties, but his rapid fire verbiage dripping with a thick French accent is both maddening and amusing.  It should be noted that even Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) returns, although somewhat `changed'.<br /><br />Much like the original film, "The Matrix: Reloaded" excels when it comes to action sequences.  An early where Neo battles more than 100 Agent Smiths provides a visual martial arts treat for the audience.  A later battle, which takes place at high speeds on a crowded highway, is one of the most suspenseful, white-knuckle action scenes to hit the screen in years.  Watching Morpheus leap from vehicle to vehicle while battling agents (and those twins) in an attempt to protect a vital entity known as the `keymaker' keeps the audience on the edge of its collective seat for the duration.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are some negative aspects to this film, too.  Aside from the incomplete feeling, of which it is merely the victim of the `middle film syndrome', "Reloaded" doesn't blend the action and philosophy in nearly as seamless a manner as the original.  While amusing, the discussions between the heroes and Merovingian, are confounding and, when examined more closely, reveal nothing.  The same can be said of a later encounter between Neo and a man called `The Architect' (whose purpose will not be revealed here).  The Architect's clipped, harsh delivery and double-talk is particularly aggravating.  The human scenes also don't resonate quite the same way the did in the original.  There is one particular scene where Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) is giving what is supposed to be a rousing speech to the masses gathered on a night to celebrate their recent successes.  The speech is so grandiose and so over the top that the message Morpheus is trying to convey is lost in the posturing.<br /><br />Fans of the original "Matrix" will come out of this film without the same sense of wonder that accompanied the first film.  Perhaps, they will even have a sense of disappointment due to some of the factors mentioned above.  However, "The Matrix: Reloaded" still strongly holds its own as a worthy sequel to "The Matrix".  The table has been set and the pressure is on for "The Matrix: Revolutions" to satisfactorily conclude this saga.</p></br><a href="../users/A461VTLW9G9YB.html">A461VTLW9G9YB</a><br/><p>They should have just left the matrix to be a phenomenon... this sequel is pointless. a waste of money, it doesn't even have a plot, just words thatt resemble religious mumbo jumbo.</p></br><a href="../users/A38U2M9OAEJAXJ.html">A38U2M9OAEJAXJ</a><br/><p>&quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot; was a difficult movie for me to review.  I saw it theatrically in the summer of 2003 and then I saw it yet again on DVD very recently.  A seamless melange of martial arts, science fiction, and Christian overtones, 1999's &quot;Matrix&quot; was both an unexpected smash hit and ignited a cultural phenomenon in the age of digital video.  The Wachowski brothers, who directed the movie, were faced with the daunting task of topping themselves, which they don't quite do on the sequel &quot;Reloaded.&quot;  Here is a film that's intermittently thrilling, sometimes boring, and often confusing.  Never mind that Keanau Reeves, as an actor, is as wooden as mahogany furniture; what really matters are the stunts, which range from good to breathtaking.  Highlights include an extended car chase and a scene featuring Neo (Reeves) going to battle with tens of Smiths (the underrated Hugo Weaving).  New to the cast is the ever-striking Jada Pinkett Smith, who, as Niobe, doesn't have much to work with, but makes the most of what little screen time she is given.  But as soon as the action stops, &quot;Reloaded&quot; hits some bumps with long stretches of dialogue that, quite frankly, are tedious to listen to.  And there's a long, pointless &quot;rave scene&quot; that seems to go on and on and doesn't quite fit in with the rest of the picture.  If any clip belongs in the &quot;deleted scenes&quot; section, it's this one.  While I'm not as rabid a fan of &quot;The Matrix&quot; as some people are, I was somewhat entertained by &quot;Reloaded.&quot;  But for all its stunning visuals I couldn't help noticing that it also lacked the unexpected punch of its predecessor.  Maybe a better title for this movie would have been &quot;The Matrix Unloaded.&quot;</p></br><a href="../users/A1E0RPGCXS4L2G.html">A1E0RPGCXS4L2G</a><br/><p>In my opinion this second isntallment of &quot;The Matrix&quot; trilogy was better than the first one.  The fight scenes were better and the special effects and stunt work were outstanding, even surpassing those of the first movie.  Of course, once again, this is a movie that you must really pay attention too.  I found myself lost at times, with holes in plot that I couldn't quite figure out.  Hopefully the third installment will fill these holes in.  Although not really my normal type of movie I found myself enjoying this one.  Although it would pay to see the first one before watching this one I think if you take it at face value you might not be any more lost that I was if you didn't see the first one.<p>The concept that the movies are based on is deep for me to think about.  The fact that life could be an actual computer program.  That we could be nothing more than programmed entities.  These deep thoughts that you could bounce around again and again are intriguing.  <p>Bottom line, in my opinion, enjoyable but not outstanding.</p></br><a href="../users/AESY8NCX6VS6O.html">AESY8NCX6VS6O</a><br/><p>I believe with all my film-lover's heart that "The Matrix" is one of the finest sci-fi films ever made, if not arguably one of the greatest MOVIES ever made. Now, let's talk about "The Matrix: Reloaded", which is, in short, an ENORMOUS disappointment in the context of the potential of the series. "Reloaded" has one huge problem with it - it takes itself WAY too seriously. The first film wasn't afraid to happily wallow in its hokey dialogue and cheesy plot, but this one simply loses the charm of the first film and actually tries to be something more than it is. Yes, the fight scenes are great (though some commit the sin of overkill - a nearly 15-minute car chase just loses something after 10 minutes), the effects are great, and it stays visually true to the first film, but the movie gets lost in its own philosophy, not to mention indulgence. The huge "orgy" scene has few rivals when it comes to "Most Pointless Scene Of All Time." Sure, the Wachowski's were trying to show that the people were becoming part of a community, but those points could have been made in a more subtle, relevant manner. I do admire at points the times when they do try to add emotional depth to the film, with Morpheus's relationship and the growing bond between Neo and Trinity, but it just doesn't work in the context of the film. Whatever happened to being a good old-fashioned sci-fi movie? I love a comment from a critic at Entertainment Weekly that said, paraphrased, if Neo ordered food from McDonald's, he would (in this film) most likely launch into a deep spiritual battle over whether he was destined to super-size that or not. It totally captures the overdone nature of the film. All in all, the movie just doesn't know when to stop. Sure, they need to keep the plot going, but if it means putting out subpar offerings like "Reloaded," maybe they should have just left "The Matrix" as a movie and not a whole trilogy.</p></br><a href="../users/A457S8SW690NM.html">A457S8SW690NM</a><br/><p>This whole trilogy is very unique and amzing and just absolutely amazing in terms of visuals. Reloaded is my favorite one though and it earned the 4 stars alone because of the action scenes. From the milllllllions of agent Smiths vs. Neo, to the fight against the frenchman's henchmen, to the awesome chase, it's original and just awesome. This movie could have definitely been one of the best movies ever but it feels confused. The plot feels confused with the sometimes bad acting to the weird story with some very random and pointless scenes. The movie also gets very boring and repetitive at times but the action scenes will leave you in such awe and amazement that you'll buy this movie just to rewatch them because stuff like this only occurs in this trilogy.</p></br><a href="../users/AMG2LF8MLUDN1.html">AMG2LF8MLUDN1</a><br/><p>As with the first movie, when I first saw this movie, I was unimpressed.  After watching it again, just like the first movie, I became a diehard Matrix fan.  Same great action and special effects.<br /><br />(Spoilers Ahead)<br /><br />I have one gripe.  The love scene between Neo and Trinity and the scene in the temple with everyone dancing around half naked were a disappointment.  Both those scenes were totally unnecessary and uncalled for.  We know Neo loves Trinity and we know Trinity loves Neo.  We din't need to see them make love.  That was a cheap thrill and I don't understand why the directors went there.  They certainly couldn't have been worried about getting an audience.  That having been said, The Matrix Reloaded is still a great ride.  Some say that this film is the worst of the set but I disagree.<br /><br />Many of these scenes have never been seen or even thought of before. There are so many new things to see here. My review would go on for days if I tried to explain them here. Don't feel left out while others discuss the theologies and philosophies of The Matrix. Instead, watch it for what you can get out of it. You may note something that everyone else missed. There are many levels and we don't get all of them at the same time.<br /><br />While many find flaws and faults with all of The Matrix films (what movie isn't flawed?) still others will walk away unimpressed as I did. Mind you I haven't seen any of the Matrix films in the theater. I do urge you to see them more than once. Once the inital shock is over, the many levels contained therein will start to seep into your brain. Pretty soon instead of saying Huh? what? you say Ahah!! I get it. So that's what that means.<br /><br />The Matrix Trilogy has ushered in a new era of sci-fi just as Star Wars did back in the day. It seems like a million years ago. We will never be the same!! We may never be satisfied with the same old thing again. The sci-fi world is forever changed now.<br /><br />I must add my kudos to the main cast. They all did some amazing stunt work and really pushed themselves physically and mentally to learn all of the martial arts moves and other dazzling feats. You can see how hard they trained when you watch the special features on each dvd. Yes there are a lot of CGI scenes but the actors are underneath most of it providing the movement for the camera to capture. Great wire and stunt work.  The sets are fantastic.<br /><br />Parental advisory: There is violence in this movie. There is no nudity or sex but there is foul language and unfortunately the Lord's name is taken in vain. I would advise a viewing age of at least 16 because the plots are so demanding that a younger mind may not grasp the details.<br /><br />THIS TRILOGY ROCKS!</p></br><a href="../users/A3O2RCKAMSE9X7.html">A3O2RCKAMSE9X7</a><br/><p>The mark of a special effects driven film that has the unmistakable cachet of being memorable is a function both of how often it is viewed after its original release and whether it has elements other than special effects going for it.  These two marks are related in that long term critical and popular acclaim depend on their interaction.  With THE MATRIX RELOADED, the brother directors Wachowski try to build on the short term success of its prequel THE MATRIX.  In this latter film, they had reasonable success in postulating a world that was a simulation of its sleeping humans who were cared for by their machine masters.  This interesting philosophical underpinning combined with some startling special effects stamped THE MATRIX as a good, but not quite very good science fiction movie.  In this Part II, the brothers Wachowski flirt with, rather than delve into, the tension inherent in a world that was not all it seemed to be and a world fought over by unsleeping humans and attacking machine squid creatures.  When the very basis of the film's aesthetic core is hidden murkily by frequent glimpses of these tentacled devices that do little more than flop around on command, then what remains is a motivation that has nowhere to go.  On a stylistic level, this aimlessness of drive is matched by an equally aimless series of montages that feature gravity-defying leaps, elaborate martial arts bouts with no one getting hurt, and a freeway chase that looks more like computer-enhanced car crashes than a filmed set piece with real stunt drivers racing up and down in their equally real automobiles.  With all these unintegrated special effects, the result is to place the viewer in the uncomfortable position of trying to care about characters who seem fated never to suffer actual harm.  Even when co-star Carrie Moss, who as Trinity, gets shot by a slug that in other scenes no one had trouble dodging, her fate is as lackluster as that of the titular hero, Neo, played by Keanu Reeves.  Reeves plays Neo as some impossible combination of Superman and Jesus Christ.  Yet, his flying and resurrection abilities do not add up to a film populated by believable characters.  Not for one second in any of the film's interminable fight sequences did I believe that Reeves was in any mortal danger.  What this second in a projected trilogy boils down to is a film that is fun to watch, but as the viewer approaches mid-point, he begins to hope for something other than special effects to hook onto.  The early returns on the third movie, MATRIX REVOLUTIONS, suggests that the Wachowski brothers are continuing the same dreary route that began with the second half of THE MATRIX.</p></br><a href="../users/A2SRZQU1SZG4RR.html">A2SRZQU1SZG4RR</a><br/><p>Not having viewed the first "Matrix" film, I had to evaluate this film on its own merits ... which is a good thing, because as I had no basis of comparison, I enjoyed the stunning visual effects and futuristic fantasy concepts without preconceived notions. However, *now* having viewed the original "Matrix", I can see a few flaws in this sequel. Overall, it is the stunning visual effects that are most memorable: fantastic flying scenes, artistic kung fu & ju jitsu fights, acrobatic leaps including walking on walls and ceilings, photographic views of the gears and machines which keep the underground city of Zion functioning. The most important reason for the film's success is the original creative concept of humans entering the computer program called "the Matrix" ... to beat it at its own game, i.e. to alter or change it. This idea *alone* makes the film a block-buster at the box office. The inclusion of martial arts and spirituality add further to the intrigue and mystery of the story line ...<br /><br />Unfortunately, the sequel lacked the depth  of the original theme: Neo discovering "who he is", "finding his own path" and realizing he is "the One" who will challenge and possibly ovecome the Matrix program. The build-up to his decision to seek information from the Oracle was nicely done but the actual meeting was a let down. Another minus to the film is the deliberatley prolonged fight scene with the Agents named Smith. It detracted from the impressive and artistic merits of the martial arts fighting. The car chase scene with the Evil Twins on the highway was also lengthy and too exaggerated . There were missed opportunities to film stunning views of the mountains and valleys of Switzterland, personally I think Neo & Trinity arrived at the Swiss castle looking for the key-maker way too soon ... a more meandering route could have been built up with a creative climax. Also, they found the dungeon in the castle where he was locked up too easily. One intriguing twist in the plot could have been to develop a romantic interlude between Neo & the French mistress of the "god-father". The writers of the film could have explored Trinity's ability to deal spiritually with a "love triangle". The "party scene" after Morpheus' speech to the humans seemed rather primitive. It appeared to trivialize the seriousness of the impending invasion by the machines.<br /><br />Overall, the sequel was good but left *this* viewer feeling the film was hyped up too much. No doubt the Matrix trilogy will change how films are made in the future but it should never be forgotten that technical merit does not replace important themes in a story. Place equal emphasis on *both* and I will gladly see the third film in this series.

We know that machines have taken over the world and have decided to control all human life. Humans are slaves serving machines. Nothing very new. In this second episode we enter the final phase of this machine-controlled world : the eradication of human life, and first of all of Zion, the city that is a concentrated vision of human and urban life. The human race is trying to get organized to resist this final apocalypse, but human beings cannot much without machines and their machines are not that good when compared with the machines of the other realm. Yet some human beings, a small team of them are following a prophecy and have the capacity to navigate mentally but in a pseudophysical state from their back world into Zion and the human world. When they thus navigate between layers of material life they leave their heavy and hard bodies behind and enter new bodies that have tremendous powers. It is these powers they need to defeat meachines. This second episode of the saga is interesting because it enables us to meet with the mathematician who has constructed the whole matrix. First he is human and no explanation will be given about how he can survive in the realm of machines, and how he can expand his life into some timeless eternity. Second he announces that he programed everything, including the prophecy that is then a lie, and that Zion and its destruction is necessary to keep the balance of this matrix and that the final destruction that is announced will be the sixth destruction. We note that there is no explanation about this number six, about why and how Zion can survive every destruction. The most surprising is of course the number six, the number of Solomon that has nothing to do with the end of the world. Yet Zion leads us to the bible and the main prophecy we can think of  is the Book of Revelation. But then the number of this apocalypse is not six but seven. In other words we are not in any kind of a meaningful allusion to the bible. The film is only using these allusions to create an atmosphere of secrecy, of spirituality that helps making the film a lot less pure action. It gives some inspiration to what would otherwise be nothing but brutal movement. Third this film transforms battles, fights and action into some kind of 3-dimensional ballets that can be very pretty at times. These ballets can be set in any place whatsoever : in an open square, in the hall of a Renaissance mansion, or on the roof of a truck on a highway. The general impression is that one or two heroes are fighting against a neverending and constantly reinforced army of cloned individuals than can become hundreds in one instant and multiply to thousands in less than ten seconds. Just the time it takes to open a door and to bring them out. And yet these ballets have some beauty even if it is a little bit repetitive hence slightly long. But what can the meaning of this film be ? We will probably come to the final meaning in the third episode. But here we do have a very negative vision of a mechanized world in which human beings are becoming completely dispossessed of their life and of their future. The human race is also tremendously reduced in vision and even the will to really fight for their survival seems to have been tremendously reduced. The future of the world, when it is menaced with utter destruction, lies in the hands of half a dozen people at the most. That does not make a crowd, does it ? Then there emerges from the film a tremendous sense of fatality. Is there any hope ? If we believe the two or three who say yes, but if we look at the real and hard facts given in the film, no, absolutely no. And this fatalistic vision is emphasized of course by the nearly black and white pictures that eare in a way filmed in all the possible shades of grey.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne</p></br><a href="../users/A141HP4LYPWMSR.html">A141HP4LYPWMSR</a><br/><p>`The Matrix Reloaded' released in the Spring of '03 is the second installment of the "Neo Mythos". Superior, mind-boggling special effects rule the day as Neo (Keanu Reeves) and his faithful band of awakened humans continue to battle Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) and the rest of the machines not only on the Matrix, but in the real world as well.<br /><br />Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus), Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity) reprise their roles from the original film and are joined by newcomers to the series; Jada Pinkett Smith (Niobe), Harold Perrineau (Link), Lambert Wilson (Merovingian), Monica Bellucci (Persephone) and Gloria Foster (The Oracle) to name a few. I particularly enjoyed the addition of Lambert Wilson and the lovely Ms. Bellucci. I wish they had made greater use of her Persephone role. It would've made for a great love triangle subplot with her, Neo and Trinity. A missed opportunity I guess.<br /><br />The Wachowski brothers have delivered with another wonderful mix of overt futuristic technology layered over a richly textured metaphysical landscape. Not as good as the first, but oh so close.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EUG9W2IAVCT.html">A2EUG9W2IAVCT</a><br/><p>The Matrix Revolutions has great graphics and great action, and it's pretty touching too--a surprise for most action-based films. Too bad parts of it are quite clique, like the Hammer's Captain Rowland (of the ship Jada Pinkett Smith's character pilots into Zion who comments on her flying throughout the sequence) using profane language in every sentence he speaks. Except for those slight "Hollywood moments," this film rocks on every level--it's full of great special effects, thoughtful introspection (it's got a great meaning) and some superb acting (except for those constant stereotypical curses). Overall, extremely satisfying.</p></br><a href="../users/A82LIVYSX6WZ9.html">A82LIVYSX6WZ9</a><br/><p>There's trouble in wonderland as Neo, Keanu Reeves (Point Break, Speed) along with Trinity, Carrie Ann Moss (Chocolat, Red Planet) and Morpheus must prepare themselves for whats to come. Theres a war brewing and also theres something fishy going on inside the matrix. Neo, being the chosen one must come face to face with multiple situations and deal with the outcome of each. Agent Smith, Hugo Weaving (The Adventures Of Priscilla Queen Of The Desert, Lord of the rings trilogy) is multipying inside the matrix..growing stronger and stronger and soon he will break out. Morpheus is convinced that better things will come and the machines will stop doing what they are doing and leave the humans along. There's action galore and more expanded story. The Wachaski Brothers have done it again making the questions and untold answers from the first one spew out into this one and sort of end it in the 3rd one. There's a long but highlighted chase scene on a highway...the digital burly brawl with Neo and The Agent Smith's, though come on people who are we kidding...there is no way in hell they could of choreographed that whole fight scene with just Keanu and a bunch of extras...theres no way. The ghost twins are excellent villains although they dont have that much time on film they make it entertaining while it lasts. Laurence Fishburne (Mystic River, Deep Cover) is just too cool for school...he's the bomb. We all know Reeves can act like wood sometimes in his movie but from my understanding Andy and Larry wrote the character of Neo that way...so it's really hard to know that Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise and even Will Smith tried out for that role.. Keanu is a perfect cast. Also starring Harrold Perrineau, Jr. (Tv's LOST, HBO's OZ), Monica Bellucci (Brotherhood OF The Wolf, Under Suspicion), Lambert Wilson (Timeline), Harry Lennix (Collateral Damage, The Human Stain), Jada Pinkett Smith (Return To Pardise, Demon Knight)and Gloria Foster. Foster died before doing Revolutions, so they replaced her with actress Mary Alice</p></br><a href="../users/A3ENN25NFADE1X.html">A3ENN25NFADE1X</a><br/><p>The problem with "The Matrix" is that it only told the story but didn't embrace and explain it as the second movie has done, it told me about Zion but didn't explain the origins of Zion. I didn't get what I wanted to help me makes sense of this world in the first one, but in the "Matrix Reloaded" I am shown Zion's population, more information about the birth of the matrix and I witness Neo's (Keanu Reeves) complete powers.<br /><br />*Part of the fun is becoming an expert in the deep meaning of shallow pop mythology and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) now joins Obi-Wan Kenobi as the Plato of our age.<br /><br />"The Matrix", written and directed by the brothers Andy and Larry Wachowski, inspired so much philosophy and so many action films that it's all "The Matrix Reloaded" can do to stay ahead of its followers. *This film is a skillful sci-fi adventure, combining the usual elements: Heroes, villains, special effects and stunts, chases, explosions and romance.<br /><br />****SPOILERS AHEAD****<br /><br />THE PLOT<br /><br />Neo (Keanu Reeves) and the rebel leaders estimate that they have 72 hours until 250,000 probes discover Zion and destroy it and its inhabitants. During this, Neo must decide how he can save Trinity (Carrie Ann-Moss) from a dark fate in his dreams.<br /><br />Three great scenes in `The Matrix Reloaded' surpass "The Matrix." The first is when Neo is fighting one hundred Agent Smiths (Hugo Weaving) This scene is the most beautiful fight scene, I have ever seen in my life. Unlike most fight scenes, this one makes sense. Agent Smith tells Neo when he destroyed him, his body parts were scattered and became the Matrix. So now he can move in and out of any program in the Matrix.<br /><br />The second comes when Morpheus returns to Zion and addresses an audience that looks like a mosh pit crossed with the underground slaves in "Metropolis." After his speech, the citizens dance to a wonderful soundtrack, which is shown with scenes of Neo and Trinity making love. Maybe those are there real bodies having sex, although I'm not sure.<br /><br />*The third sensational sequence is a chase involving cars, motorcycles and trailer trucks, with beautiful choreographed moves including leaps into the air as a truck continues to move underneath. This scene is a 14 minute fun ride, although I might wonder, if such deadly enemies meet in one of these virtual spaces, who programmed it?<br /><br />I recognize two philosophies in this movie. First, I feel that this is what might happen to humankind if they let technology develop unchecked. The second philosophy is that love and hope will conquer all.<br /><br />The film ends with a "To Be Concluded" a reminder that the third film in the trilogy arrives in November. I loved this film and I recommend it to anyone. I give this film a 15 out of 10.<br /><br />* NOTE: two of These sentences are from Roger Ebert's review of Matrix Reloaded.</p></br><a href="../users/A35XMSURGM0L1N.html">A35XMSURGM0L1N</a><br/><p>I was blown away when I saw the Matrix for the first time and still rank it among my favorite movies ever. I was looking forward to the sequel and again it is good. <p>The story continues about Neo fighting in the Matrix with Morpheus and Trinity. The enemies are now more, hundreds of Smiths and a very scary albino twin. There are however too many fighting scenes and sometimes it is very obvious that computer graphics have been used, even for real people. The scene with Neo fighting hundreds of Smith is absurd.<p>But still, the graphics are amazing, the choreography is very worthwhile and the story keeps you thinking as well. I wasn't dissapointed, not at all, so watch it if you liked the Matrix I</p></br></body></html>

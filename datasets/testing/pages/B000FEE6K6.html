You are taken through a gun-manufacturing factory from the point of view of a bullet that ultimately ends up in the head of an innocent child.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage plays a russian under an assumed Jewish identity in New York.  He is surrounded by violence and he begins selling guns.  He continues to position himself increasingly deeper in the gun trade.  He gets his brother involved early on, but soon "loses" him to a dark side of the game.  His life becomes a mess, as he gets involved with drugs and his downfall begins.<br /><br />He goes against his better judgment and his sense of invincibility becomes weakness.  Just when you think the curtain is about to fall on our "hero", you are exposed to a piece of information that will blow your mind (kind of).  The fact that the movie is based on true events should be enough to sicken most Americans.<br /><br />This is a good movie.  It's very well done, although something about it makes it feel as though it's all been done before.  The narration reminded me of Goodfellas...</p></br><a href="../users/A6ADO7B6FUVN.html">A6ADO7B6FUVN</a><br/><p>There is one scene in Lord of War where Nicolas Cage's character leans over a statue of Lenin counting his profits on a calculator, which symbolically provides a strong notion of how a nation has failed its people.  However, the notion should not only be applied to the former Soviet Union, since as the film unfolds it is obvious that the corruption exists in all nations of the world.  This suggests that numerous nations in the world have failed their people.  Lord of War focuses on the arms dealers and the corruption and deception that trail this spineless profession, as they sell weapons to all of those who can pay regardless of human lives.<br /><br />Empty shells in the millions lay on the ground spread out around Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage), which means business is booming for a stone cold arms dealer.  Yuri's expensive suit bears proof in his success dealing in arms trade and that he never gets involved wherever the weapons are sold.  Consequently, he provides the audience with staggering facts that there is one firearm per 12 people in the world to which he comments on how he could arm the other eleven.<br /><br />A jump cut brings the viewer to the manufacturing of a bullet from the stage of being a sheet of metal to when it is fired and enters the head of a child.  The child who is shot is also firing a machinegun.  It is a powerful message displaying the impersonal machinery of making weapons, but it also shows how penetrating personal each bullet is when they hit an intended targets.<br /><br />Through a large amount of voice-over the audience learns the story of Yuri.  It is a told in an authentic manner, according to Yuri, as he begins with informing the audience about how he got started selling weapons.  It is clear that he began for the same reasons many try to make a better living for themselves while dreaming of a better life.  Besides this he tells us about the importance of the environment, and how it affected his choice to go into arms dealing.<br /><br />The story stretches over a 20-year period, as he makes deals with anyone interested in buying weapons.  It covers drug lords, warlords, freedom fighters, terrorists, dictators, and nations trying to get their hands on weapons otherwise not accessible.  Some of these characters affect Yuri's life in a negative manner, but he ignores the bad aspects of the business, as he is good at it.  Yuri also does not care to whom he sells his weapons, as long as the paycheck comes through.  He even informs the audience that he does not make business with Osama Bin Laden, as his checks bounce.<br /><br />It might seem a little morbid, but the film also effectively applies a heavy dose of irony in order to show the two sides of the story.  The irony also works well to Yuri's comments, as he rationalizes why he is in the business of selling firearms.  After all, the only true winners of wars are the arms salesmen.<br /><br />Initially, it feels a little frustrating with the large amount of voice-over, however, as the story unfolds the voice-over enhances the authentic atmosphere, as if Yuri really was telling his life story.  The camera functions much like an extension to Yuri's voice-over that helps fill in the details of his dirty job.  In addition, the cinematography occasionally augments the visual imagery through excellent scene framing that brings out an artistic side of the dark world of arms deals.  The visual aesthetics and powerful issue in the film brings together a genuinely intriguing cinematic experience that keeps the audience thinking while being entertained on a high level.</p></br><a href="../users/A3D6KZT0QG6UKB.html">A3D6KZT0QG6UKB</a><br/><p>2005 seemed to be the year when directors jumped on their soap boxes and said "Pay Attention to the world!" with overtly political movies like Munich, Syriana, Good Night & Good Luck. Lord of War didn't make as much money or garner as much critical acclaim as the other movies on the list, but it was certainly a better movie.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage turns in one of his most nuanced performances since Leaving Las Vegas as a arms dealer who started out selling ammunition to the gangsters in his neighborhood and quickly rose to the international stage with the end of the Cold War. His international dealing in all the war zones from Lebananon to Liberia gives us some of the best camera work this side of Brokeback Mountain. Cage's dry one liners keep the movie going even as he reveals himself to be a despicable creep (but with the African death squads that buy his weapons, he is comparitively decent) who even attracts the moral disgust of other arms dealers represented by Ian Holm who actually have an agenda in their business practices. Cage's wit in delivering the lines like "I didn't supply Osama Bin Laden, not out of moral reasons. He was bouncing checks at the time." keep you from outright hating him.<br /><br />Jared Leto provides the moral center of the movie as the troubled brother who initially helps Nicholas Cage, but can't handle the guilt from being responsible for so many deaths. In another world, this movie would be Jared Leto's story and he is certainly proving himself up for the task of carrying his own movie. Ethan Hawke spins his wheels as the ATF agent out to nail Cage, but he's largely in the background.<br /><br />Despite the way the plot apes Goodfellas, you never feel like you are watching a morality tale. Cage is in a much more dangerous business than being a gangster and his choices sustain and doom him.<br /><br />Actually the movie's opening sequence of the path of the bullet from factory to crates to boxes to boy's head tells you all you need to know about this movie. It's fun. It's witty and ironic, but ultimately it is dealing with some very serious issues and the serious consequences of being alive in a post-Colonial, post-Cold War era in which no side is clear, but the guns are in ready supply.</p></br><a href="../users/A32XW50ILWOXNO.html">A32XW50ILWOXNO</a><br/><p>"Lord of War" opens with the creation of a bullet. It's molded, packed, shipped, plucked out of a bucket, loaded and fired into a child's head.<br /><br />Writer/director Andrew Niccol's film blunt like that, and clever. It darkens world events we thought blessed. Americans celebrated the end of the Cold War. So did freelance gun dealer Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage). The fall of Communism left bunkers of weapons and war vehicles without an army to use them. Yuri, a Brooklyn son of Russian immigrants, swoops into the Ukraine, cleans out the stockpile, and moves the "merchandise" to third-world dictators. The mass genocides that have rages through both of our Gulf Wars - in Africa, Bosnia, Southeast Asia - partially owe their existence to peace between two superpowers.<br /><br />Yuri owes his fortune, his New York penthouse, his trophy wife Ava (Bridgit Moynihan), his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) and his soul to it. Starting with Yuri's first Brooklyn gun deal in 1984 and progressing through the viciousness of West Africa that rages still, "Lord of War" traces his descent into the amoral, reckless, killing coward he becomes by movie's end. It's not necessarily a tragedy - Yuri's a willing crook, part nihilist, part purposeful ignoramus - but a sober essay on gluttony as a way of life, fueled by international apathy. "The ones who know don't care anymore," Yuri says. "And the ones who care won't know."<br /><br />Yuri's lifestyle eventually leads him to the wars of West Africa in the late 1990s, specifically Liberia, run by a goofy fascist named Andre Baptiste (Eamonn Walker) and his son, Andre Jr. who owns a golden gun and drives a Ford Fairlane with two women dressed as Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders in the back. The Andres are Yuri's best clients and his worst temptation: They'll deliver him anything - enemies included - in exchange for guns.<br /><br />"Lord of War" occasionally pauses to consider Yuri's personal life. Vitaly starts as a partner, but his distaste for the work presses him toward self-destruction and addiction. Leto does his wild-eyed thing to some effect. Moynihan had A looks and C skills, serving the role of the bland, pretty Ava well. Unremarkable beyond her looks - and aware of it - she places conscience above comfort to aid her husband's Javert, Interpol cop Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke).<br /><br />Yuri crosses key moral lines in West Africa; fully given over to his sins, we doubt his attempts to go straight when Ava initially confronts him. But the last act falters; it needlessly shoehorns Vitaly back into the business and fashions a cynical, unlikely anti-climax between Yuri and Valentine that seeks to shift the debate from our charming villain to the system that permits his existence. Ever the dutiful liberal film, "Lord of War" tacks on a postscript about the no good, very bad UN Security Council, but I'll better remember the scene where Yuri stumbles around in Liberia to discover two growling hyenas. It's fitting company for him.</p></br><a href="../users/A1P98DMX8YUSNW.html">A1P98DMX8YUSNW</a><br/><p>Like many of Nick Cage's recent movies, this one has a smirkiness about it that runs all through it. Maybe it's the flat-affect voice-overs that play all through the film. But this seems more like a comedy than a thriller, even though it's about private gun-runners and is loosely based in reality. Many of the scenes are almost slapstick, even when people are getting blown away by his products. If you think this is straight, then the joke's on you.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B3Z2QHW3V35S.html">A2B3Z2QHW3V35S</a><br/><p>I like true story movies. So when hubby told me about this movie I knew I had to have it. It is a really good movie. Nicolas Cage is a great actor. This is a must see movie!!!!</p></br><a href="../users/ADLVFFE4VBT8.html">ADLVFFE4VBT8</a><br/><p>What's the difference between, let's say a 'country' sending military 'aid' to other governments that oppress their own people and sometimes attack, invade or occupy their neighbors and private arm dealers buying (usually small) arms from wherever they can and selling them for a profit to whomever can afford them? There are differences of scale. As Yuri Orlov notes toward the end of the movie, right before the credits begin to roll, the president of the United States sells more weapons in one day than he (Yuri) does in a full year. Then there's the issue of legality. Since it's the governments who decide what's legal and what's not, small fish like Orlov are known as 'gun runners' and they are to be viewed as evil or irresponsible. Unlike governments who usually 'spread freedom', provide 'aid' or help the nicer dictators, autocrats and internationally recognized oppressors fight 'extremism' or 'anarchy'. Unless the governments want to 'help' certain extremely vile states or 'movements', in which case they covertly use the little gun runners to funnel their support. 'Lord of War' ends with an interesting observation - nothing new or unexpected, a fact known to most of us but, somehow, hidden almost out of existence someplace rarely visited inside our mind: world's largest arms dealers are the 5, armed to the teeth,  permanent members of the Security Council: the United States, Russia, France, Great Britain, China.<br /><br />'Lord of War' is the story of Yuri Orlov, a small fish, private gun runner who makes a living for himself and his family by doing, illegally, a little bit of what legitimate governments do officially. People die while Yuri, most convincingly portrayed by Nicolas Cage, gets rich. And, while they are killing each other, it's worth noting that some of the weapons used by one side or sometimes both sides were provided by Yuri, often at great personal risk. Being small and a private individual, Yuri is constantly chased and harassed by agent Valentine of the Interpol and his life is a constant, dangerous and risky struggle of surviving his business dealings usually involving bloody dictators or drug dealers, keeping his marriage from falling apart and keeping Vitaly, his kid brother, from completely destroying himself by means of mass quantities of drugs consumption.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage acting is superb and so is Jared Leto's as Vitaly Orlov, Yuri's brother. All others are playing their parts well but this is mainly the story of Yuri and both the part and the actor easily eclipse the rest into 'supporting' parts. Besides Cage's acting, the effort to provide authenticity is remarkable - 100 tanks that Yuri is about to buy were real, not props, and they were indeed for sale and so are some of the behaviors attributed to some of the characters such as the Liberian president.<br /><br />'Lord of War' is a commendable effort at providing an inside view into the world of weapons commerce but, in the end, it misses the mark and even the movie's makers seem to be aware of it. Yes, it's true that private arms dealers sell arms but it's also true that their contribution to global mayhem is small to insignificant when compared to what the real market leaders, the world's big 'powers' can provide. It just may be that the problem is not that, as Yuri observes, one in twelve people owns a gun but that eleven out of twelve don't and they are often at the mercy of those who do. Far from being a lord of war, Yuri's character fulfills a need and, human nature being what it is, it's quite likely that someone else would step in the moment Yuri turned pacifist and, as history teaches us, people are quite capable of killing each other by the millions, with or without fire arms. Watching 'Lord of War' was not time wasted. The movie does have its moments but the impression it leaves is that... maybe movie makers wished they aimed a little higher or closer to the root causes of state instigated or state inflicted violence.<br /><br />--<br />>> Brush your teeth, it's the law! &lt;&lt;</p></br><a href="../users/A1X054KUYG5V.html">A1X054KUYG5V</a><br/><p>The Bottom Line:<br /><br />Not only is Lord of War utterly fascinating, with good performances by Cage and Hawke, but unlike other movies that feature a protagonist making his living through things that kill people (like, say, Blow), Lord of War manages to both make us sympathize with the main character and yet realize how much he's helping evil to thrive; it's a film you'll remember and a film you should see.</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>A surprisingly good movie, this tale of a gunrunner over several decades of his life is not an action movie, and not just a drama.  It's an all round look at what it means to be a gunrunner - how it came about that he became one, the good times - the bad.  The effect on family and loved ones.  At times serious, at times downright funny, often poignant, it's all the way through laced with its own style - a style which manages to pull off  the difficult feat of mixing entertaining and  thought provoking.  Through frequently quite imaginative editing and narrative, the story never gets dull.<br />Cage is good in the role, but it's an all round effective supporting cast which make it really work - making his transition believable.  The change from just another immigrant, to a man dabbling in the guns business, to a man sucked in by his own choosing to a world of ugliness by the lure of riches - or rather, as he puts it.. just because it's  what he's good at.  A particularly effective and revealing moment comes when Cage is faced with a seemingly arbitrary murder during one of his sales pitches with the pistol he is selling.  His look of horror is quickly masked and replaced with indignation that the new gun has been soiled by use and is now worth less.  It's a theme throughout - at one point is it no longer possible to separate the business of what you are doing from the effect of what you are doing.  Does it happen immediately you start down the path - or does it happen after a time?  Of note is the contrast to how his brother, played by a fantastic Jared Leto, is affected.<br />How far embroiled in a world can you be without being affected... it's an interesting question, and one made all the more fascinating by the context  of how much gunrunning our own governments do routinely, as the movie points out.<br />Definitely recommended as an entertaining blockbuster - but with some brains to go with it.</p></br><a href="../users/A5KJVGJ43ZDC9.html">A5KJVGJ43ZDC9</a><br/><p>This is what happens when you create a fight, but won't accept responsibility for your actions. Nicolas Cage plays a gunrunner who will sell any weapon to anyone-all under the table so that the major arms selling countries like the US have plausible denial when wars begin. This movie works on many levels, as a tale of misbegotten fortune, a political thriller, and action, action, action. Some humor too. Well rounded, reality-based and attracive, this is a super buy.</p></br><a href="../users/ATZ1LTONGHOP6.html">ATZ1LTONGHOP6</a><br/><p>Five minutes into "Lord of War" I realized that I had seen this film before, except it starred Johnny Depp, and was about cocaine trafficking and was called "Blow". Yeah, there are a lot of similarities between "Lord of War" and "Blow", both plot-wise and in the style of the films.<br /><br />"Lord of War" tells the story of Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage), a Ukrainian-American arms dealer, who brags about having sold guns to every army on Earth except for the Salvation Army. Although Orlov is a fictional character, the script is based on actual events and is so well researched that it is completely believable to the point of being scary. Orlov is a completely immoral character who is unashamed of what he is doing and the idea that people like him could actually exist is genuinely frightening.<br /><br />From an entertainment point of view, "Lord of War" is not a fun film. The first half of the film, which details the rise of Yuri Orlov and his arms deals in assorted Eastern European countries is enjoyable enough, but I found the second half, in which Orlov moves into the war-ravaged African countries, to be depressing. The film is redeemed by an ending which I liked very much, but because of the scenes set in Africa, I probably won't be watching this film again in a hurry.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Nicolas Cage is excellent in this film. Initially, I felt that he was just playing the same character that he has played in every other film, but Cage's portrayal of Orlov as a man whose soul has been totally destroyed by his actions, at the end of the film, is still haunting me as I write this. Overall, I preferred "Lord of War" to "Blow" because, unlike in "Blow", the makers of "Lord of War" weren't afraid to show Orlov for who he really is, a soulless man responsible for the deaths of millions.</p></br><a href="../users/A3ROE64EVHDTTV.html">A3ROE64EVHDTTV</a><br/><p>The Good Things<br />*Complex, all-encompassing story that's thrilling and interesting throughout.<br />*Very strong, thought-provoking themes (especially concerning the moral implications of gun trafficking, the corruptive nature of crime, world governments' role in worldwide violence, and many other eye-opening topics).<br />*Lots of memorable scenes and imagery that reinforce the various themes.  Good filming style.<br />*Excellent characters.  Nicholas Cage provides both witty humor and bleak moral commentary.<br />*Some parts are exceptionally detailed and realistic; it is clear that the filmmakers did their research.  Good writing.<br />*Good sound and music design.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Some themes really are convoluted, especially regarding the main character.  Even though he looses everything, he never really suffers any legal punishment and never learns from his mistakes, and continues to smuggle guns.<br />*Not sure if the film is really politically or socially accurate.<br /><br />I could summarize this as "Scarface" with guns instead of drugs, but such a comparison is really too simple.  Although Yuri (Nicholas Cage) has many of the same traits as Tonny Montanna, he is a very different character, full of wit and wisdom that contrasts with his lack of morality.  This film also differentiates itself with vivid settings (both physical and political), a strong filming style, and some very revealing themes.  This film portrays many of the problems in developing countries, and explores the issues surrounding them.  By the end of it, it leaves you bleakly pondering about the world's situation.  I would definately reccomend to everybody to at least rent this movie.</p></br><a href="../users/AUM3YMZ0YRJE0.html">AUM3YMZ0YRJE0</a><br/><p>This is a pretty good film about a man who self-actualizes the corruption that is in the deepest part of his soul as a black market arms dealer.  Cage narrates this life - out only for himself, regardless of who he helps to kill - and it is effective to a degree.  We witness his rise, his many ruses to avoid prison or execution, and its repercussions on his personal life.  I admit, Cage's dark humor and splendidly indifferent tone are at times funny and affecting.  But the best characterizations, I think, are in the people he encounters, from the cold rival arms dealer he fights to the brutal African thug who makes him rich.  It is very good acting.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this is Hollywood trying to display some social conscience.  There is a kind of breathlessness to it, like they are revealing something to the audience, almost as reporting, but I found its sincerity rather naive.  While it is good to expose audiences to this, I suppose, the tone of the film implies that none of us know about these kinds of people already.  (I, for one, have been following the issue since 1982, when I read The Global Politics of Arms Sales,  by Andrew Pierre, which is a great academic masterwork, or Anthony Sampson's reporting on it from the early 1980s.)<br /><br />There is no way you can say airing these issues is bad.  Recommended for those who haven't follwed the issue of international arms trafficing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B73CL3QSYWLB.html">A2B73CL3QSYWLB</a><br/><p>Andrew Niccol's account of International arms dealing never fails to entertain, but, alas, doesn't hit the homerun.  I have been a big fan of Niccol's previous forays in paranoia.  "The Truman Show" and "Gattaca" are masterpieces.  Heck, I even liked "S.I.M.O.N.E".  Despite some bullseyes Niccol doesn't seem to focus his arguments here, therefore, he can't ratchet the sufficient outrage against the death merchants in our midst.  What redeems the film is Nicolas Cage's charasmatic turn as Yuri who enters into arms dealing as a lark and dicovers he's just so damned good at it.  A great scene in the film is where Yuri is stuck in an African village with a planeload of munnitions.  With Interpol on his tail he proceeds to empty out the contents of the plane by giving it away to the natives.  Not bad, but could have better.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSMQIF1C2VCE.html">A1NSMQIF1C2VCE</a><br/><p>Nicholas Cage seems to do the classic (although now somewhat uncommon) practice of making a highly commercial movie to pay the bills, followed by a more interesting, more arty film. Lord of War is one of those artier films, but it has the ability to cross over to audiences who don't normally think of themselves as enjoying such movies. Think of it as the Goodfellas of gun-running.<br /><br />Lord of War is a blend of comedy and drama, weighted on the dramatic side, telling the whirlwind story of how a boy from Brighton Beach became one of the world's biggest arms dealers. The movie moves too fast for us ever to learn much about most of the characters, but the actors are mostly up to the cast, sketching out their characters in a few quick strokes that suggest hidden detail the viewer never gets to see.<br /><br />In particular, Jared Leto plays Yuri's younger brother who is tormented by the morality of their livelihood. Leto sinks his teeth into an arguably underwritten role and serves as the canary in the moral coalmine.<br /><br />Cage is his typical mix of manic and obsessive in a role where both work, and Bridget Moynahan is radiant while still bringing gravity to her role later in the film.<br /><br />The movie has no easy answers for the moral questions it raises.<br /><br />A solid recommendation for fans of intelligent crime movies, Nicholas Cage and Bridget Moynahan.</p></br><a href="../users/A34D06JL7LC6MU.html">A34D06JL7LC6MU</a><br/><p>I think the title of this review says it all, but this is truly a spectacular movie. In retrospect, it's like a guns version of the Johnny Depp movie "Blow."<br /><br />Actually in more ways than one. Both films are about men who begin working in illegal businesses while making vast sums of money and watching their dream come true; And then watch their lives crumble around them with time. Also both films received good reviews and featured Oscar worthy performances and scripts but were ignored by the Academy. Nicolas Cage takes a break from playing his loser character (Matchstick Men, The Weather Man, etc.) and instead plays Yuri Orlov, a Ukrainian man who was raised in Brooklyn. Yuri realizes one day that doing what he's been doing isn't working for him, so with the help of his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto, 'Requiem for a Dream') he becomes a private gunrunner delivering to people in places like Sierra Leone, Russia, and Liberia. Meanwhile, Yuri also marries his dream girl Ava Fontaine (Bridget Moynahan, who looks completely different then she did in the movies 'The Recruit' and 'I, Robot') and has a son. The movie says at the end "Based on Real Events," which means nothing...I doubt that a man named Yuri Orlov existed but that doesn't make this film any more or less interesting. Writer/Director Andrew Niccol paints a near perfect portrait of a troubled, yet brilliant man who's trying to support his family and make money no matter who or what he risks. This is one of Nicolas Cage's best performances since "Leaving Las Vegas." Both Eathan Hawke (That dude who was married to Uma Thurman) and Ian Holm ('From Hell') deliver good supporting work; Especially Hawke who plays an Interpol agent chasing Yuri for years and never truly getting what he wants. The movie presents a great message, something young viewers won't notice sadly enough. This is not only one of the most morally terrific movies of 2005, but it was also one of the best and most overlooked. If you haven't seen this movie, then just do it.<br /><br />GRADE: A</p></br><a href="../users/AUHG8KSHI529U.html">AUHG8KSHI529U</a><br/><p>While I do like Nicolas Cage as an actor, I didn't think this movie deserved the critical praise it has received.  The movie cost about $40 million to make and only did $24 million in U.S. box office (but $62 million world wide), so I think the public got it about right.  What is the problem with the movie?  Well, first of all, and there are exceptions to this, if the story is mostly told in narration and the movie is used to illustrate the narration, it usually means the screenplay has real problems.  And that is certainly true here.  It would be incoherent without the Nicolas Cage voice over.<br /><br />Another big problem with the movie is that it not only has a point of view, and not only has that point of view brightly attached to its sleeve, I felt like I was viewing a propaganda film against the arms trade.  Yes, it is a film against the arms trade, and that is fine (if you want to make a film about that), but it doesn't try to be balanced in any way.  It is really a smear of arms and arms dealers by loading them up - particularly Cage's character (Yuri Orlov) - with all kinds of reptilian and decadent traits; almost inhuman.  After all, how could you sell weapons to people who were going to use them against civilians unless you were a monster?  Never mind, that in the key scene in the movie the weapons we see used on a woman and child are machetes, which can be made anywhere out of any kind of steel you can put an edge on and attach a handle to.<br /><br />Look, I am not arguing FOR the arms trade, just against the way it is portrayed in this movie.  It probably is corrupt and surreal.  However, they point out that this story is based on actual events.  Except that when you watch the extra features we learn that the Ukrainian the story is based on lived in Italy, not the U.S. and he got off because of a loophole in Italian law rather than being protected by corrupt officials in the U.S. government who used him to keep the fingerprints off of some deals.  Now, that may well be done, I don't know.  But real events showing such transactions were not shown in this film.<br /><br />Still, the movie has some pretty funny scenes (funny in a very dark way).  However, there is real violence - beginning with the powerful opening montage (done in computer graphics) of the life of a bullet for an AK-47 from its being made in Russia until it is used in Africa.  There is also some very sexual scenes and depictions of drug use - again to show how the arms trade saps the humanity out of those who practice it.  Pretty heavy handed depictions, too.<br /><br />So, if you are interested in another film blasting blood diamonds, the weapons trade, and the major world governments -  but particularly the character of Americans, hey this is a movie for you.</p></br><a href="../users/ABFOAYZA2UHD3.html">ABFOAYZA2UHD3</a><br/><p>on the world we live in i have ever seen.<br /><br />depicts all the cruelty and uncaring and.. numbness and lack of any or all feeling toward other people, their suffering, and indeed their LIFE.<br /><br />i hear it is based on true story, but even it is not, you KNOW things like that happen EVERY DAY in the world, cuz you watch the news.<br /><br />its a true tragedy.<br /><br />and an excellent film with nick cage perfect in the role.</p></br><a href="../users/A2M597GCCE1N2S.html">A2M597GCCE1N2S</a><br/><p>When Yuri Orlov [Nicholas Cage] discovers that his only talent is selling illegal arms to warlords and mafia crime lords, he starts on a wild ride that eventually [or I should say inevitably] leads him to getting in more messes that even the smoothest talking can't get him out of.<br /><br />Lord of War stars Nicholas Cage as a Ukrainian immigrant to America who discovers that they only thing he is good at is selling illegal weapons. His first deal is like, "The first time you have sex. You don't know what you are doing, but it is exciting, and ends way too quickly." Helped by his brother [Jared Leto] Orlov goes on to start selling more guns to countries that are at war with other countries because that is where the big money is in selling guns.<br /><br />The movie is styllish and is fast paced in lots of scenes as Orlov goes to different areas in the world, from Russia to Africa, to South America. He eventually reaches the top of the mountain and becomes very well known by war lords, has lots of one night stands with women, and not to mention he also becomes very rich. How rich? He rented out a hotel just so he could trap a beautiful model [Bridget Monayhan], his dream girl, and eventually charm her into marrying him.<br /><br />However like all good things there is an equal level of bad things such as; Orlov's brother as a cocaine addict, even running away with a kilo of cocaine and going crazy in a third world country. His wife has no idea what he does for a living, and like Cage's character says, "It's not the double life that you live that gets you, it's the fourth, fifth, and sixth lives that will."<br /><br />Ethan Hawke is also in the movie as an interpol agent whose sole purpose of living it seems is to bring Orlov down. The first scene we see Hawke's character is when Orlov is on a freighter with M-16's and has to cover the illegal guns with thousands of potatoes that don't exactly smell like a field of fresh flowers in the warm sun.<br /><br />The movie does have a lot of scenes not for younger viewers involving women, as well as a lot of violence and language. Some smaller plot lines include Orlov meeting a Liberian dictator [Eamonn Walker] whose son is just as ruthless as his father, holding his trademarked solid gold AK-47 with him wherever he goes.<br /><br />There aren't many extras for this DVD, besides seeing trailers for the movie and subtitles. The lack of extras is the only thing I would see as a down side if you are the type of person who is into DVD extras. This is totally worthy of a DVD rental if you want to see a good movie on a Saturday night. [or any other day of the week, it's your choice] But definately check this movie out for a solid story.<br /><br />"There is one person out of every 12 who owns a gun, the question is how to arm the other 11."</p></br><a href="../users/A1ADG449ZNEO6Y.html">A1ADG449ZNEO6Y</a><br/><p>Having proven his ingenuity as the writer of The Truman Show, and writer-director of Gattaca and the under-appreciated Simone, Niccol is clearly striving for Strangelovian relevance here as he chronicles the rise and inevitable fall of Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage), a Ukrainian immigrant to America who makes his fortune selling every kind of ordnance he can get his amoral hands on. With a trophy wife (Bridget Moynahan) who's initially clueless about his hidden career, and a younger brother (Jared Leto) whose drug-addled sense of decency makes him an ill-chosen accomplice, Yuri traffics in death the way other salesman might push vacuum cleaners (he likes to say that alcohol and tobacco are deadlier products than his), but even he can't deny the sheer ruthlessness of the Liberian dictator (a scene-stealing Eamonn Walker) who purchases Orlov's "products" to expand his oppressive regime. Niccol's themes are even bigger than Yuri's arms deals, and he drives them home with a blunt-force lack of subtlety, but Cage gives the film the kind of insanely dark humor it needs to have.</p></br><a href="../users/A1L8HRCM60W0W7.html">A1L8HRCM60W0W7</a><br/><p>Reviewers may pooh-pooh the marked Hollywood glibness to its narrative, or the minor liberties it takes with factual minitiae, but Lord of War is no mean feat. It soars high above those gripes with a compelling tale well told, some top-notch acting, and a gripping script peppered with a million rent-a-quotes.<br /><br />The theme had me at Hello: a biopic of a gunrunner's meteoric rise to the top of the global arms race, and his inevitable slide thereof, although its final suit is not buttoned quite so neatly. The sinister trade of glocks and AK-47s is often ignored by popular media in favor of seemingly bigger pies like air force jets and nuclear scuds, but as a matter of fact these little handheld weapons account for more bloodbaths around the world than all other alternatives combined.<br /><br />The little revolutions they foster in unglamoruous corners of the world such as the Balkans or northern Africa are seldom televized, so a film so palatable and entertaining serves a very respectable purpose despite playing on the fringes of moral preachiness. In that sense, its punches may sometimes be predictable, but why not -- given the brutality of the world it depicts, it is all eminently forgiveable. A clever undertone of timely black comedy only helps matters along.<br /><br />You know you have seen something special if you ruminate on it for days afterward, and this chilling, provocative, enlightening production causes that in spades. Sure-shot nomination for Cage come Oscar time. A must-watch for everyone, but a must-own for the discerning.</p></br><a href="../users/AVT9Q9PTUCDMR.html">AVT9Q9PTUCDMR</a><br/><p>The story itself is a real winner about a weapons dealer who is really out there as far as his wheeling and dealing. The problem is the movie slows down in too many parts and a key character (his brother in the movie) in Nicolas Cage's character's life just disappears off screen for a huge chunk of the movie.<br />Gratuitous Ian Holm, super gratuitous Ethan Hawke channeling bits of his Training day cop character as well as a dopey Matrix-like follow-the-bullet intro and it's a pretty goofy movie really.<br />I dug it but I think you really have to be in the mood for Nicolas Cage's over-the-top performance.

Much better than I expected.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4.html">A3UPYGJKZ0XTU4</a><br/><p>"Lord of War" is a black comedy cum morality tale about a fictional international arms dealer, purportedly based on several real arms dealers, whose path to wealth and substantial market share takes him to hot spots around the globe through the Cold War and ensuing free-for-all. Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) immigrated to Brighton Beach from the Ukraine with his family in the 1970s, where he had the revelation, after witnessing a mob hit in a restaurant, that, just as people will always have to eat, they will always have to kill. After selling guns to local mobsters for a while, he realizes, "The real money is in actual wars. Between countries." Shunned by the big-time arms dealers who operated with the CIA's blessing during the Cold War, Yuri turns to the gray market with his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) in tow. Idealistic Interpol Agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) becomes his persistent pursuer.<br /><br />"Lord of War" is told in biographical fashion, with Yuri delivering a biting, witty voiceover narration about his adventures in the arms trade throughout the film. The narration is smart, ironic, and funny. But it is delivered with droning lethargy by a self-loathing, vaguely regretful Yuri. This exemplifies "Lord of War"'s fatal flaw. Writer/director Andrew Niccol doesn't like his protagonist, hates guns, and probably disdains political violence in general. What's worse, Yuri is telling the story, so his own angsty, guilt-ridden delivery reflects his director's bias. Imagine reading a novel that is narrated in the first person by someone who can't stand himself. You will have a pretty good idea of what it's like to watch this film. Yuri is an interesting character who has a provocative story to tell. But he tells it with bored detachment, acute self-loathing, and without a trace of the salesman's vigor and sheer nerve that it took to sell weapons to the world's scariest war-mongers. Arms dealers are not, in reality, burdened by excessive guilt. Yuri enjoys his business, and he's good at it. Yet he refuses to act like it.<br /><br />"Lord of War" is ultimately critical of the arms trade. That's fine, but Andrew Niccol allowed his socio-political agenda to hamper his strengths. He wrote a smart, funny narration and then was afraid to let us laugh at it. The arms dealers and their ultra-violent clients are absurdly comical, but the film tries to shame us out of laughing at them. One minute, Yuri's commentary struck me as hilarious; the next minute I am being told that guns and killing is a very grave matter that only immoral people would make light of. "Lord of War" goes back and forth like this, constantly undermining itself. I commend actor Eamonn Walker for playing bloodthirsty Liberian President Andr&eacute; Baptiste, apparently based on deposed President Charles Taylor, with such gleeful viciousness that I couldn't help laughing at him. He seemed to understand that Baptiste was nuts but also completely ridiculous.  I like "Lord of War"'s script a lot. But it needed a more energetic lead performance and a director who was willing to make an all-out black comedy. People would get the message that the arms trade is unethical even if Yuri liked his job and relished his accomplishments. There was no need to emasculate the guy and bore the audience.</p></br><a href="../users/A39AWL2FKWDFK6.html">A39AWL2FKWDFK6</a><br/><p>Director Andrew Niccol depicts the frivolous aggrandizement of a contemporary armaments merchant Yuri Orlov played by Nicolas Cage in "Lord of War".  Cage, a Ukrainian emigre leading a dead end existence in Brooklyn's Brighton Beach, decides to dabble in the business of dealing arms.  Within short order he establishes himself in this dangerous business allying himself with scores of heartless and murderous despots in the process.<br /><br />Cage, who manages to glean a fortune from his enterprises, successfully is able to buffer himself from the slaughter wrought by his products.  He is able to maintain a lavish lifestyle, wooing and marrying the woman of his affections model Ava played by the attractive Bridget Moynahan.  His younger brother Vitaly who is his partner played by Jared Leto, however soon succumbs to the pressure, falling into the abyss of cocaine addiction.<br /><br />Throughout the film Cage is monitored and chased by federal investigator Jack Valentine played by Ethan Hawke.  Hawke plays a role analogous to Inspector Javert to Cage's Jean Valjean in Les Miserables finally trapping his long pursued prey.<br /><br />The finale, however tries to, unsuccessfully in my view, affirm the justification for this allegedly indispensible endeavor.</p></br><a href="../users/APIW11UEPKIC2.html">APIW11UEPKIC2</a><br/><p>I rented this along with unleashed, two for the money, saw, constant gardener, and transporter 2.  It was obviously better than transporter, but it was easily the best of the bunch.<br /><br />This movie really does nothing too special, but it is a story that we haven't seen before.  Nicholas Cage plays a gun-runner/conman.  There is no huge plot in this movie, but Nick's bro has some major issues.  His wife becomes a pretty good character even though I would have liked to see some more conversations between them.<br /><br />What this movie does do is capitilize on every oppurtunity that it had, this is not billed as a huge action thrill ride, and rightly.  The action is mainly those funny suspensful moments when you know the star is gonna figure something out to get out the stuation.

Nicholas once again takes control of another character piece.  The problem is a lot of his eccentric characters feels and looks like each other.  Plus, I think he and Morgan Freeman are in some unknown competition of who can narrate the most movies.  First it was difficult to suspend disbelief about Nicholas Cage being Ukrainian--but whatever.  I was quite impressed with Eammon Walker (a dancer turned actor)-quite a commanding presence.  As for the story--it's a pretty descent story, however, hard to believe-Yuri was a one man operation.  As far as the problem with the arms dealers which this film was so eager to point out, is that there is no solution.  None.  This film was basically made to tell you to be afraid--be very afraid.  Oh, yeah...and purchase a gun.  Heaven forbids that you be the only sucker walking around who isn't armed.</p></br><a href="../users/A3R36DZQEWNVJ1.html">A3R36DZQEWNVJ1</a><br/><p>Nicolas Cage (Face/Off, Family Man, upcoming Weather Man) stars as Yuri Orlov, who is an arms dealer who sells guns to people in other countries....where their for he gets money.

I think part of the reason some individuals didn't enjoy the film is that they didn't explore the depths of the characters very well; and this is definitely a character-driven film.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage is perfect at Yuri Olav, a Ukrainian native who's family moved to America years before. They run a substandard Russian restaurant that serves borscht (beet soup) as a staple. Their father has become a devout Jew. And Yuri and his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto, REQUIEM FOR A DREAM) help with the restaurant. Then one day, after witnessing a failed assassination attempt, Yuri receives an epiphany: everyone needs guns. Thus the stage is set for him to become one of the premiere arms dealers in the world.<br /><br />Against the backdrop of Yuri's life, we get to see the effects of his chosen profession upon his brother's psyche. Vitaly gets into drugs and women, anything he can to help him forget that he and his brother are involved in a business that allows people to kill other people. And when Yuri gives up gun running for a while, Vitaly too comes back to a semblance of normalcy. But when Yuri returns to guns, and asks Vitaly to join him, the stress becomes overwhelming (this is something that I have yet to see any other reviewer comment on and, the way Jared Leto pulls off his excellent portrayal of Yuri's brother, it's a pretty powerful message.)<br /><br />I also think that many reviewers may not understand the mentality of a sociopath. Their moral compass is broken, according to our standards. So when Yuri (Cage) doesn't grow out of his morally ambiguous state, it didn't surprise me one little bit.<br /><br />Also, Nicholas Cage is a deadpan actor, and that's probably why they chose him. Remember RAISING ARIZONA and the diaper scene in the convenience store? Or LEAVING LAS VEGAS? Or BRINGING OUT THE DEAD? Cage was the only person I could think of who could pull off a convincing Yuri.<br /><br />I also need to comment on the brutal message that smacks the viewer. From the opening sequence in the film where we see Yuri standing in a war-torn street surrounded by a paved street covered in spent gun shells, to the scene where Vitaly witnesses the execution of children in Africa, there's not a single moment in the film where the biting reality of what Yuri does and how it effects those around him isn't displayed.<br /><br />One thing that really intrigued me, too, is that I saw the film's trailer on TV long before the movie came out, and they always showed the bit where Yuri is in the airport and is approached by agents from the ATF, and Yuri says "I guess this isn't about the alcohol or tobacco." I laughed at the trailer. But interestingly enough, once that scene came up on screen in context to the rest of the plot, there was very little comedy in it and the message much more powerful and poignant.<br /><br />This film definitely had it's comedic moments, but laughing at it is oft-times painful to think about because of what we see Yuri and his brother go through later.</p></br><a href="../users/A1S8AJIUIO6M9K.html">A1S8AJIUIO6M9K</a><br/><p>Many of the reviews of this movie are unusually naive and stupid.<br /><br />My review of this movie is based on a lifetime overseas as the son of an oilman, as a Marine Corps infantry officer, as a clandestine case officer for the Central Intelligence Agency, and as the foremost trainer of governments interested in getting a grip on reality by focusing on open source of information in all languages.<br /><br />This is a first rate movie with some truly extraordinary visuals and some truly extraordinary lines.  It is an intelligence movie for intelligent people, and it should certainly give anyone both a couple of hours of enjoyment, and a couple of hours of reflection.<br /><br />Among the highlights:<br /><br />1)  AK-47 as the real weapon of mass destruction<br /><br />2)  Africans stripping a plane overnight, literally pulling every piece of it off and making it "disappear"<br /><br />3)  There is one gun for every 12 people, the arms dealers goal is to arm the other 11 as quickly as possible<br /><br />4)  The top arms dealers ("merchants of death") are the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.<br /><br />I read more than I watch movies, and will end with two comments: a) all of my reading bears out the importance and relevance of this movie; and b) it is easily one of the more serious and appreciable movies I have seen in some time.  The intellect in the devising and presentation of this movie is absolutely first rate.</p></br><a href="../users/ANIMV3SPDD8SH.html">ANIMV3SPDD8SH</a><br/><p>Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) sells international weaponry like he's selling used cars. If you don't like the deals from the former Soviet Union's stockpile of arsenal, you may be interested in a huge lot of discontinued assault rifles. How about unused guns and ammo from the U.S.-led aid to the Bosnian War? If you stick a gun in his face, he'll bring the price way down.<br /><br />"Lord Of War" is a cynical, yet not heartless and probably accurate portrayal of an American 'secondary market' international weapons dealer. Yuri globe-trots the world scooping up fantastic deals on abandoned and obsolete weaponry and peddles it off to third world countries where demand for blooldshed is high. His biggest competitor, he likes to joke, is The President of The United States.<br /><br />So you get a heavy dose of good-humored anti-war subtleties, with a highly entertaining movie thrown in for good measure. The first person narrative, sometimes spoken directly into the camera, offers an endless stream of topical one-liners. Some work, and some don't - "Buying your first gun is like making love for the first time. You don't know what you're doing, but you know you're having fun." - or something to that effect. You eventually come away with a crash course in international arms dealing, that all the Time magazine issues in the world couldn't offer, sure to make you a more politically conscious observer. Exposure to the horrific results of weaponry in such an entertaining fashion is harsh, humane and like an unexpected needle from a doctor.<br /><br />Like a confident puppateer above the chaotic gunsmoke of war, Nicolas Cage reveals a believable and likable global arms dealer, who could be the same guy you saw selling a hot car radio in an ally. His scenes selling guns are nerve-bending as he makes bold physical and vocal gestures never riling dangerous warlords, while the slightest nervous tick could set off a slaughter. Bridget Moynahan's 'trophy wife' is anything but, an honest and touching portrayal of a rather superficial person coming to terms with her husband's means to wealth. I loved what she said about her failed careers and her stand against Yuri's profession, - "I have been a failed artist and a failed actress. I will not be a failed human being." Eamonn Walker as Liberian dictator Andre Baptiste delivers a suave and vicious characterization as a man who will 'test drive' a new assault rifle by killing someone in the room with it.<br /><br />I went into this film mistakenly thinking it was the upcoming film, "Jarhead". I saw previews for both and confused the titles. A little troubled by my mistake, it was as if someone pointed a gun to my forehead and said, "watch this film instead." I'm sold. Good deal!</p></br><a href="../users/A3N5XIM9R2OQH0.html">A3N5XIM9R2OQH0</a><br/><p>In reading about the Third Reich (which I've done quite a bit, even though it's not the most pleasant subject matter), one element I noticed running through many commentaries was that of the banality of evil, referring to the strange tendency of the most ruthless Nazi functionaries to be regular people who went about their jobs the way most of the rest of us do, with little if any thought given to the massive human suffering involved.  Sadly, that's usually the way it is: evil is good at hiding.  The most morally bankrupt people-gansters, tyrants, drug lords, U.S. Senators-generally aren't raving, slobbering maniacs, but instead can often be found hiding behind nice suits and slick smiles.  So it is with Yuri Orlov, the moral vacuum at the center of Andrew Nicol's frequently inspired Lord of War.  This is some excellent political filmmaking: dark, hilarious, and unflinching, with occasional but suitably brutal depictions of violence and general depravity, all framed with Cage's matter-of-fact voice-over narration.<br /><br />This movie basically does for gunrunners what Goodfellas did for gangsters: there's no real plot per se; it just captures several extended snapshots from a life and career spent on the wrong side of the law.  All the basic elements of Martin Scorcese's classic portrayal of Henry Hill's life can be found here-the meteoric rise, the materialistic excess, the twisted characters and violent deaths, the myriad family problems-but Lord of War adds ample doses of the kind of black humor that made Dr. Strangelove and Fight Club such subversive classics.  Moreover, where the power and influence of the Mafia have subsided since the events of Goodfellas transpired, this movie makes clear that the gun trade is still very much alive and well.  As Yuri himself says late in the movie, his work may be evil, but it's a necessary evil, ensuring that business will always be good.<br /><br />Played by Nicolas Cage in the best work I've seen from him next to his dual role in Adaptation (which was some of the best acting I've ever seen from anybody, so I doubt he'll ever top it), Yuri's a friendly enough guy with a nice deadpan sense of humor, capable of compartmentalizing his life to the point where he can sell weapons to the most brutal of dictators under the rationalization that he doesn't control what they do.  Besides, while it may be a dirty job, someone's gotta do it.  Yuri basically just buys enthusiastically into the capitalist notion of getting what he can when he can, without getting caught up in the tangled web of loyalties that characterizes foreign relations.  After all, if people are going to kill each other (and they are) and someone's going to profit from it, he reasons, it might as well be him.  The early going of Lord of War follows Yuri around the world as he sells to anyone, anywhere, anytime (but not to Osama Bin Laden: back in the '80's, his checks frequently bounced).<br /><br />While Yuri himself is resolutely nonpolitical in his endeavors, the movie places his activities squarely within the changing face of world politics as the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union leaves a vacuum that Yuri's only too happy to fill.  Starting with his first sale of an Uzi in New York's heavily Ukrainian Little Odessa, Yuri quickly graduates to wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan, hitting it big when his uncle sells him a mother lode of former Red Army stock.  From there it's on to Africa, becoming the arms dealer of choice for a vicious Liberian dictator and his insane son (memorably portrayed by Eamonn Walker and some guy whose name I can't remember, respectively).  Lord of War gives us a look at some of the nuts and bolts of arms dealing, focusing heavily on Yuri's efforts to stay one step ahead of driven Interpol agent Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke, all righteous indignation and selflessness, at least on the surface), but the movie is more a character study than anything else, examining the traits that enable someone to profit from the enabling of war and mass murder (to the extent that the two concepts can be considered separate, anyway).  Yuri is able to succeed largely because of his unique moral flexibility, a trait that allows him to overtake former arms-dealing kingpin Simeon Weisz (Ian Holm), who's hindered by his pesky habit of taking sides.  Sure, Yuri has reservations at times, but the temptation offered by a big score always outweighs the satisfaction of earning an honest buck.<br /><br />Yuri is periodically joined in his dealings by his kid brother Vitaly, who's everything Yuri isn't: wild, undisciplined, equally prone to orgiastic drug use and sex and paralyzing attacks of conscience.  As played by Jared Leto, Vitaly is the voice of sanity and conscience in a business that has no room for either, making him conspicuously less fit for the job than his brother.  Yuri also winds up with a pretty trophy wife in the form of his childhood dream girl Ava (played by Bridget Moynahan, better known in my neck of the woods as Tom Brady's girlfriend).  Since Ava's never achieved anything in her life beyond looking good, it's a rather thankless role, but Bridget does what she can in her few dramatic moments.<br /><br />I must say, some of the more critical analyses of this movie on this site have left me a bit perplexed.  Some people seem to be interpreting it as another hand-wringing "message movie" from the Hollywood left, but I don't really see too heavy-handed an agenda here beyond showing what an ugly place the world often is.  If anything, it aims to illustrate the moral bankruptcy behind the lofty claims of those who proclaim themselves patriots, freedom fighters, or other such high-minded labels.  After one of his deals leads to a massacre of Sierra Leonean civilians, Yuri muses that people say evil prevails when good men do nothing, when they should just say evil prevails.  In a world filled with bigotry, hatred, and violence, it's not that hard to see his point.</p></br><a href="../users/A1NSUJJCG73IRF.html">A1NSUJJCG73IRF</a><br/><p>Director:  Andrew Niccol<br /><br />Cast:  Nicholas Cage, Jared Leto, Ethan Hawke, Bridget Moynahan, Jeanne-Pierre Nshanian, Ian Holm, Sammi Rotibi.<br /><br />Running Time:  122 minutes<br /><br />Rated R for strong violence, drug use, language and sexuality.<br /><br />Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage) and his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) immigrate to the US to Little Odessa with their parents (Shake Tukhmanyan and Jean-Pierre Nshanian) who have posed as Jews to escape the Ukraine in 1980 - before Glasnost. Yuri is bright and sees gunrunning as a lucrative business and after his first tiny success in the gang infested Little Odessa, he convinces his dreamy-eyed brother to be his partner. The business grows exponentially as Yuri discovers his best customers are countries at war: in time he is wealthy, has married his dream sweetheart Ava (Bridget Moynahan) and settles in as one of the more successful gunrunners in the world. He buys weapons from stockpiled American ordnances after the US has 'finished' a war and sells them to Eastern European, African and South American revolutionaries. He is tracked by Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) who in his role as a government agent is determined to stop Yuri's dispersal of deadly weapons that result in needless deaths when disseminated to countries in the throes of political change.  Though Yuri is first for business, he does care deeply about his wife and child, and about Vitaly whose entry into the world of wealth is soon squandered on a cocaine addiction requiring frequent detoxication. Yuri is not a mean spirited man: he sees his business as just that, salesmanship of items for which there is a huge demand and he does not see himself as the perpetrator of violence. His life has moments of compassion, many moments of financial success, moments of pride in being the gifted gun-runner he has become, and moments of introspection. He hobnobs with dictators, revolutionaries, fellow gunrunners and the law.<br /><br />"War" is crowded with crisp, imaginative visuals, which Niccol ("Gattaca," "Simone") mounts with unusual aplomb. Following Yuri through his 20-year journey as he rises from common criminal to respected trafficker, Niccol and his production crew take every occasion to show off some potent visual flair, padded with terrific CG work. One of the more striking moments of the film is sitting with a handcuffed Yuri in the desert, as he watches, through time-lapse photography, the immediate dismantling by the African locals of the cargo plane that he arrived on. "War" is a customary journey from poverty to criminal opulence, but Niccol's attention to detail perks up the screenplay, and constantly strengthens the ideas that he's frantically (emphasis on frantically) trying to communicate.  The casting of Nicolas Cage also aids Niccol's blueprint for "War." Back in dynamic mode after sleepwalking through "National Treasure," Cage coolly plays Yuri's rise to prominence, always making sure to underline his professionalism, loyalty, and cancerous doubt whenever he can. Though backed by a fine supporting cast, this is Cage's film, and he lives up to the promise of the role beautifully, skillfully weaving through conflict and opportunity like a used car salesman, but burdened with the soul of a pacifist. It's a complex role, daring the actor to play a greedy scumbag with sympathetic leanings and Cage is one of the few actors around who can pull off that treacherous character structure.  "Lord of War" may irritate some people as there isn't a clear story, and the characters serve more as a way to portray the movie's themes than add any emotional weight to the proceedings. The characters do have their moments, however; and a scene that sees Cage having his hand forced by one of his customers expertly portrays the character's attitude and the reason why 'Evil prevails'. Yuri Orlov doesn't want to get his hands dirty; but he's happy to profit from the people that don't mind dirtying theirs. Despite not being a film about characters, Lord of War definitely belongs to its main star.  An adequate attempt at highlighting one of the most underappreciated and unknown travesties of world government and crime; however, a slowly-paced, underdeveloped tale that could have been much more entertaining and resounding.</p></br><a href="../users/A9LAPV8XNKZVZ.html">A9LAPV8XNKZVZ</a><br/><p>It not really a shoot em up.

I enjoyed it and recommend it although it's not for the squeamish.</p></br><a href="../users/A2809U2S14N0K1.html">A2809U2S14N0K1</a><br/><p>Between the white market of the offical arms trade we have the people that sell illegally and semi-legally weapons. This is an interesting story of these gun runners today and its effects today.<br /><br />It had a ring of truth to it. The story was well written.<br /><br />The acting was good. Nicolas Cage in particular.</p></br><a href="../users/A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ.html">A1PW6G3EFXCLFJ</a><br/><p>Nicolas Cage plays a Russian immigrant to the US, Yuri Orlov, who adopts gun-running as a way out of the poverty of Little Odessa in New York. Mr. Cage is always watchable and LORD OF WAR has excellent production values. However, I found LORD OF WAR to be little more than a fictionalized documentary on gun-running. That is because there is little plot and little characterization. Mostly, we see Yuri going about his job running guns and his domestic life when he is not. While Yuri must deal with unsavory characters and eager-beaver US feds trying to put him out of business, there is little conflict of the type that sustains a principal storyline. Yuri is not even really much torn with guilt or indecision about being a gun-runner. Actually, he provides the film's arguments in favor of gun-running. (Someone will do it. People are evil, not the AK 47s. Etc.) His cocain-addled brother and the director and writer provide the counter arguments, leaning of course against gun-running. I mean, this is Hollywood, which in no way is going to come out in favor of gun-running. But, surprisingly, this is a fairly balanced presentation of the pros and cons and of the reality of the world of small wars, where people need weapons. (Think of the Tutis in Rwanda. They could have used a few AK 47s to keep hundreds of thousands of them from being chopped up by Hutus.) I'll give Nicolas Cage and LORD OF WAR cudos for integrity and fair-mindedness, a rare commodity among self-righteous Hollywood types.</p></br><a href="../users/ALG7QH2L5JL2L.html">ALG7QH2L5JL2L</a><br/><p>Only Nick Cage could pass this off: a guy without a smidgen of conscience that you don't end up loathing, who deals in weapons with the same ease that others go from door to door selling accident insurance for CICA.<br /><br />Why? Because he's good at it, and because there will always be a market for things that'll kill people. Ethics doesn't come into it; at best there's a little squeamishness when he's asked to pull the trigger himself.<br /><br />A product of our times, or the child of a dysfunctional society? I doubt it. People without conscience come in all shapes and sizes. Some end up as serial killers, some as arms dealers, some as business tycoons. Take your pick. It's the variety and range of human expression and human 'nature'.<br /><br />Grounds for despair about the species? Your choice. As for me I think there are enough good people to make continuance worthwhile. But where there is a market for death and brutality, someone will take advantage of it.<br /><br />It's a grim flick, but a good one. It makes you think; leaves you wondering what exactly to become upset about, because there are so many things; from the world at large to this bunch of messed-up people, ranging from Yuri to parents to trophy wife. Or you could get upset about everything, of course, but be warned, because if you're of that inclination, you're going to come out of this movie with a very dark mindset indeed.<br /><br />So, beware.<br /><br />It it worth having been made?

Nicolas Cage stars as Yuri Orkov, a Romanian immigrant who works his way to the top of the gunrunning trade, taking on a fashion model wife (well played by<br /><br />Bridget Moynahan), his cocaine-addicted brother (a convincing Jared Leto) and a competitor (Ian Holm, cagey as always).  Cage's character is really an antihero but with his sharp wit and self assuredness, a likeable one.  Ethan Hawke has a supporting role as Jack Valentine, a federal agent who dogs Cage but can never come up with enough evidence to put him away.  The movie's ending is chilling in its implications.<br /><br />While not a movie to really admire for its thematic content, LORD OF WAR is very well done and Cage is extremely good in this difficult role.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ.html">A2GBJQ9THOYDAJ</a><br/><p>Yuri Orlov (well played by Nicolas Cage), Ukrainian immigrant kid in Brooklyn in the early `80s, casting about for a career, witnesses an assassination attempt on a local mafioso and thinks: Weapons. Everyone wants them, everyone needs them. From selling a single Uzi to a local hood, he progresses to buying up abandoned U.S. small arms overseas, to shipping every kind of munitions you can think of to every part of the globe. Then it's 1992 and the Soviet Union collapses, and ex-Soviet army officers in all the various republics begin selling off the weapons systems under their control in order to replace their lost paychecks -- several billions of dollars worth from the newly-independent Ukraine alone. Most of his buyers are African, especially the bloodthirsty dictator of Liberia and his cannibalistic son -- and the Orlov character, who's well aware of what his trade facilitates, has a number of perceptive and pungent things to say about the West's attitudes toward the multiple African genocides of the `90s. (There are a number of shocking scenes and camera shots that are definitely *not* for kids.) Meanwhile, Yuri has acquired a wife, a high-priced model, to whom he lies continually regarding his business, until the straight-arrow ATF agent (or maybe he's Interpol; it's not clear) who has been pursuing her husband for years clues her in. Finally, Yuri's extremely troubled younger brother is killed during a deal in Sierra Leone and it's an overlooked bullet in his body, shipped back to the States, that leads to Yuri's arrest. The climactic scene, in which Yuri explains to the agent exactly how and why no charges will ever be brought -- the government *needs* men like him, though they'll never admit it -- is like a bullet between the eyes. The world's largest arms dealer, in fact, lives in the White House, selling as many weapons in a day as Yuri does in a month. And the largest arms brokers in the world are the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. This is a deeply cynical film, but that doesn't make it wrong.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MNMZMM6BGLTA.html">A2MNMZMM6BGLTA</a><br/><p>The one thing I noticed when I was going to review this movie was making the decision about giving it a 2 or a 3 stars. I don't think it is good enough to be a 3 by some of the other movies I have rated but I don't think it is bad enough to be a 2. So 2 1/2 I guess. I saw the previews of this movie and thought I would check it out. I looked like an interesting premise based on a very interesting subject. I thought that Nicholas Cage did an excellent job as the former Russian immigrant who turned small time arms dealer and then into an major international arms dealer. Again the subject is something that is very intriguing and very interesting but alas the movie just drags. I remember when watching it thinking, "this is going to be good." Then, "this is pretty good" and then as it went on and on I was thinking, "man, ok, I wish this thing would wrap up and end." So somewhere in there it lost me. Jared Leto was accutally pretty good as Cages brother and Cage has a pretty hot wife. The guy that plays the African dictator is great and does a really good job. The movie also shows a lot about the politics and cultures of the African nations that are torn and fed by violence and arms. Also I almost forgot that Ethan Hawke is very good as the ATF guy that is pursuing Cage. But somewhere in all this the movie loses something and is over long and just not that good.</p></br><a href="../users/A27CHILBK6HIL2.html">A27CHILBK6HIL2</a><br/><p>MOVIE: Ever wonder what reading a script is like? Well, with Lord Of War it becomes a first hand experience.  Lord Of War is a film about a guy who is one of the hottest arms dealers around. Yuri (Cage) tries to find his calling in life, and he stumbles into international arms dealing.  What the entire movie basically talks about is if it's moral, and when I say "talk" I do mean it.  The entire movie is narrated by Nic Cage's character, every thought and every action. Each scene is layed out by narration and then wrapped up with narration. It gets to a point where you feel like yelling at the writer and tell him "to shut that goddamn inner monologue off". What seperates a film from a book is that the action is performed in a film rather than described. People call this film an "action/adventure", but I find no justification for this to be placed in that genre. The only thing this movie has going for it is that there are some interesting ideas being thrown around. Unfortunetly all those ideas don't make an impact because the audience becomes so bored with the film. In terms of cinematic achievments, there are a few well done scenes.  A scene involving Nicolas Cage and Ian Holm was pretty tense, and so is a scene that shows Nicolas Cage going through some hallucinations. The opening credits were  brilliant in my opinion, but then again I couldn't wait to see the closing credits.  The relationship between Cage and his wife was also pretty bad. Basically she married Yuri for the money, and then she gets angry with him when she finds out what he actually does and that he had been decieving her. Talk about true love. The movie never finds its direction, and that makes the audience suffer for two hours. It had some nifty camera work and cinematography, but the satirical points the movie was trying to make was lost due to poor pacing and no direction within the plot.<br /><br />ACTING: Nothing stellar, we've all seen what these actors can do and they don't do much more than that here.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Not very enjoyable, you may get a chuckle or a smile from a witty line a few times throughout, but all the 3rd person narration will bore you to tears.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DAOL3NMHEPLS.html">A1DAOL3NMHEPLS</a><br/><p>An interesting but often slow-moving film that chronicles the exploits of a fictitious international arms dealer over a period of two decades.  It is supposedly "based on true events," and probably is -- but it's hard to believe all of those events occurred in one man's experience.  The "message" (international arms trade is bad) is delivered in a fairly heavy-handed manner, but there are occasional moments of dark humor to keep the movie from becoming too preachy.<br /><br />The production is good, if you like deliberately flat and muted photography. Cage does a decent job as the protagonist/narrator, although I found the voice-over narration tiresome after a while. The overall consensus rating of 3.5 stars is about right; I went with three stars because half-star ratings are not allowed on Amazon and I think this is slightly closer to being a 3-star entry than a 4-star.</p></br><a href="../users/ALJGB7XHPFCR.html">ALJGB7XHPFCR</a><br/><p>This is a story told by Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage) as an international arms dealer. This seems to be a movie with an educational and ethical mission about the international situation in arms dealing. It includes the fall of the Soviet Union to conflicts in Africa. Cage goes through his paces as an arms deale, with no real excitement. Cage aquires a trophy wife (Bridget Moynahan) who uses selective denial, and Ethan Hawk represents the law that is always on his tail. Eamonn Walker does a great job as Andre Baptiste - leader of an African nation who plays Cage's main customers. Walker is great at playing a bad guy.  This film is emotionally cold in that it is told from the viewpoint of someone who caters to cold blooded killers. It is intense at times, some tension and enough action. This movie deals with ethics, however it is not a fun movie. It is not a feel good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EEUQ81DTY7G3.html">A2EEUQ81DTY7G3</a><br/><p>Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) is a young second generation Ukrainian living in New York's Little Odessa. Life is tough for Yuri; frustrated and poor, he realizes that he's not really that good at anything, with the world pretty much offering him a ticket to know where. When we first meet him, around 1982, he is longing to bust out of the kosher restaurant owned by his father, who fervently keeps up the charade of being Jewish that he invented so he could get his family expelled from the Soviet Union.<br /><br />I guess when you're raised on a lie; it becomes pretty easy to keep the pretense up. Yuri, recognizing he has a talent for being in the wrong place at the right time, hatches a plan with his kid-brother Vitali (Jared Leto) to sell arms and ammunitions: "that was the day I realized my destiny lay in fulfilling another basic human need." Of course, there isn't much business for this kind of thing in the States, so Yuri and Vitali find themselves doing business in Berlin during the height of the Cold War.<br /><br />Their criminal trade eventually takes them to South America, where Vitali gets hooked on coke, and where, for the first time, they meet their arch nemesis Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke), an idealistic Interpol agent.  But the bulk of Yuri's fortune is made when the Soviet Union crumbles and its vast cache of weapons is made available to him.<br /><br />Now Yuri is free to sell his product to war torn Africa, where he becomes professionally entangled with Liberian president Andre Baptiste (Eamonn Walker), a kind of Charles Taylor-like fanatical dictator. Along the way Yuri becomes a very rich man adopting a glamorous supermodel trophy wife Ava (Bridget Moynahan) and tries to help his brother Vitali beat his steady addiction to cocaine and alcohol.<br /><br />Director Andrew Nichol's movie is unapologetically purposeful, and his subject matter is incendiary and also quite timely. The devastating consequences of the weapons trade are well known, and Lord of War is a forceful film with a lot on its mind. Then why is the film so flat and un-involving? Perhaps because it's all so convoluted - Nichol probably has enough material here for five movies, consequently his narrative never complete meshes; it's as though Lord of War is a film in search of a decent plot.<br /><br />It doesn't help that Yuri is played by Cage, one of the most over-rated actors of his generation, doing his usual softly spoken, puppy dog shtick; he blusters when he should be quiet and raves when he should be contemplative. When the dialogue isn't enough to provide the facts, Nichol stuffs Yuri's mouth with cynical, and contemptuous narration to describe the dirty business in detail, but you really have to worry about a film when Yuri's verbal announcements are far more intriguing than the fictional plot devices used to provide human drama.<br /><br />I guess you could say that Lord of War is mildly intriguing when it deals with the nuts and bolts of the weapons business, and it often sails along with a nifty, amoral irreverence. But it's just too overly didactic and preachy, ultimately sinking under the weight of it's own message and pretensions. What really does this film in is the director's penchant for turning Yuri into a character that we should care about.<br /><br />There are a few cheeky moments complete with some funny lines, but after forty minutes or so, it all becomes terribly repetitive. After all, we've got the message in the opening credits, which follow the life of a bullet from the factory to the forehead of a third-world teenager.

Nicholas Cage saves the film, however.  While I'm glad I didn't spent $18 to see this in the theater, it was worth the $3 rental.  Are you sure you want to pay $20 for this DVD?  Think twice about it.</p></br><a href="../users/ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T.html">ABO2ZI2Y5DQ9T</a><br/><p>The theme of the film - international arms dealer -- is a very serious one, but unfortunately it was too much for writer/director Andrew Niccol. `Lord of War' claims that the content is based on the actual events, but the important thing is - What part of it?<br /><br />I believe that there is a man like Yuri, Ukrainian-born arms dealer, who finds his unexpected `gift' as gunrunner. The deadpan acting of Nicholas Cage as Yuri makes this fellow more credible than the overwritten script allows for him. Actually, the most intriguing moments of the film come when we see him as businessman whose cool and non-committal attitudes towards politics and moral are curiously attractive. Or repulsive to some of you.<br /><br />And I believe that even this so-called `Death-Merchant' can be a good father, love his wife, and care his drug-addicted brother (Jared Leto). If Andre Niccol says that he actually met the real-life arms dealers, and that he thought them nice people, there is no reason I should not believe what he says. And you will see at the same time that Yuri can sell guns right in front of the possible victims who are going to be killed, and that complexity in his characters makes him all the more intriguing.<br /><br />However, the rest of the film is overloaded with clich&eacute;d items, none of which have a ring of truth. How many times should I write that Interpol (ICPO) never send the investigator (here played by Ethan Hawke)? They may send to or receive the information from each country's police around the world, but never investigate themselves. Or how many times should we see the romance with a beautiful woman when we don't need it? Yuri gets his dream woman Ava (Bridget Moynahan) only to disappoint her. Yuri's brother gets what you know he will get when he reappears in the second half of the film, and so does Yuri's rival in business (Ian Holm). In spite of the good acting, these supporting roles only lessen the reality that the film is supposed to have.<br /><br />The film's weakness can be easily ignored if `Lord of War' is meant to be something entirely fictional. It is not, and the character of Yuri convinces you of the fact. But the film remains uneven, even has a scattershot appearance though the central character hits the target.</p></br><a href="../users/A3UDYY6L2NH3JS.html">A3UDYY6L2NH3JS</a><br/><p>An interesting film on arms trafficking, but too pedagogical in many ways. It tries to prove too much and it misses the real point. The real point is not the horror of these tribal or neighborly wars. The point is not the corruption of all the little warlords in Africa and other areas in the world. The point is not the domination of arms trafficking by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. The point is not even the rottenness of the politicians of western countries, of developed and emerging countries. The point is the hyena that lives in the human heart. The idea sure is present in the film, but not shown the way it should be shown. There is no escape from this basic idea that the human being is a predator against his own species, hence a cannibalistic predator, one of the very rare animal species that has this characteristic. Somewhere this film tries to save the human side of that predator. There is no saving of that human side because there is no human side. The human side is nothing but an illusion projected by hypocrites to hide their tracks and footprints. That's what the film should have shown in the most realistic way. Unluckily it did not dare. It tried to save humanity and show it is manipulated by the few predators that would be living in our midst. But these are not a few. As soon as a human being, especially in a group, a band, a gang, or whatever collective structure or party (all meanings of this word intended), has a little piece of power, that human being is going to turn predator. The trade-unionists in a strike will kidnap and keep hostages the engineers or managers of their business. The minority students will block their universities to force classes out and they will speak of a strike and pretend their diplomas and degrees must not be retained from them as a payment for their strike just like a worker loses a day's pay for one day's strike.. Professors or students will sell university diplomas to foreign students (maybe to French ones too) to make their week-ends comfortable. A cop will release the evidence of still not yet tried case to hurt who knows who and the public will not see the denial of the rights of the defense but plain information for the public to know. A bunch of hooligans will kill someone in public and in front of a camera just out of rage, when it is not a five year old boy who kills a five year old girl at school or some individual who starts shooting in a school, on a campus, in an underground station, a supermarket or the street, not to speak of terrorist attacks and suicide bombers. There is no end to that horrible human nature. Sainthood, saint-dom or saint-ness not to speak of sanctity do not exist on earth. Maybe in heaven but after death only. In this film it is more or less asserted that some cops are honest though impotent, that some people hate violence, crime and guns, that some people may prefer poverty in purity rather than wealth in blindfolded innocence. I do not believe it. There is no right side in no conflict. The working class is in no way better than the capitalists. If they get power they turn terroristic, they open and manage some gulag, or whatever procedure to eliminate the other side. There is no guarantee that any one human being could be in any one way innocent. Better get used to that fact.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID</p></br><a href="../users/A4X7FBQ5SKPI6.html">A4X7FBQ5SKPI6</a><br/><p>Hate to break it to you all, but the film is not even close to the true story.  The real man this film is based on was an ITALIAN from ITALY.  His story had absolutely nothing to do with the United States.  Oh, and our troops did not leave piles of working M-16 Rifles abandoned in Grenada or anywhere else for that matter.  Absolutely unreal how Hollywood will do anything to turn the facts into fiction in order to trance the masses.  Michael Moore would have been proud, but at least Moore does try to apply some balance and facts.  This thing was nothing more than a fictional story.  It also left out the fact that the three countries who are thick in arms deal ings seem to not have "USA" applied on them anywhere.

In that profession, one thing's clear: you screw up, you get shot.  Nicholas Cage gives a nonchalant, yet superb performance in the most nihilistic film I've seen this year, "Lord of War."  Dark and violent with black humor that effectively blend the course of the content, this is the kind of film that would make Kurt Vonnegut proud...if he watches films with rarely sedative themes.<br /><br />The film starts in a field of used bullets, and Nicholas Cage as Yuri stands in the middle of it, surrounding by the sounds of gunfights.  Yuri is an arms dealer, and he talks to the audience about his profession.  He's not trying to teach you a lesson about his experience, he's just talking about his experience as it is.  In a fashionable narrative (the same narrative that people in amazon.com are downsizing about), Yuri strolls down to memory lane when he first came to America in the 80s, and later sees his first sight of gunshots in a restaurant, leading to his fascination of selling guns.<br /><br />As years passed when he worked as a lackey in a practice to sell guns, Yuri then becomes a sole proprietor of an arms dealing business.  With his gifted talent of negotiating deals and getting out of trouble, he alone travels from one corrupted country to another, selling off his "merchandise" to some of the most notorious dictators in world.  At the same time, he's playing multiple lives not only for the customers but for his family, besides his brother, who doesn't know his profession.<br /><br />Because he's working in a black business, there's always the "Zenigata" that tries to stop this "Lupin" from commiting more crimes. Ethan Hawke plays a CIA agent who's on the hunt to find Yuri and arrest him for arms smuggling, though Yuri's always one step ahead by hiding the evidence and make him look wholesome.  Even when Yuri gets away from the CIA, he can't get away with the fact that his job is the most hellish thing he must deal with and it alienates him from his family, but he can't help it, because he's good with it.<br /><br />This is a heavy tale coming from Yuri.  Whether he's at Columbia or Liberia, there are graphic killings and massacres happening (and they are based on actual events), and it was all thanks to the guns he sold.  But he never questions how customers are using the weapons, since it would hurt his business, and by the end of the day, it's all about the business.  He should be considered a bad person for selling arms to criminal countries, but then we're also living in criminal countries.  That's what's so nihilistic about this movie: it subliminally shows what the US and other 'civil' countries are doing even before Yuri sold his first gun.  As cruel as this movie shows, it's a common practice that continues to reach massive profits, at the cost of massive casualties.<br /><br />It doesn't hurt that "Lord of War" is also hilarious.  Yep, despite the violent elements, the movie has a wicked sense of humor.  There are many moments in this movie that laughed my butt off: the scene where Yuri and his family have to become Jewish, even though they are Ukranians; Yuri giving his brother a line of pot to sniff before sending him to rehad; a weapons convention (??); and the vicious moments that deal between Yuri and the high leader of Liberia, whose played by Kareem Sa---I mean, Eammon Walker (Damn you, OZ).  Even with its funny moments, it doesn't stray far from being so brutal, and by the end of the movie, the feeling of laughter and sorrow is thought-provoking.<br /><br />The problems with this movie?  Well, more plot could've been involved in Yuri's youth, and the ending could be better without the view of sentimentality.  And that's it, really.<br /><br />"Lord of War" is a sleeper hit, and it's unfortunate that not many people have give this movie a viewing consideration. these people have missed out on the sardonic writing and brilliant concept.  Don't you be the one to miss out on this shocking film, so go out and see "Lord of War"; it might shoot you in the heart (figuratively speaking).<br /><br />This is Del Keyes, saying "Guns are bad, unless they're worth something."</p></br><a href="../users/A19ZXK9HHVRV1X.html">A19ZXK9HHVRV1X</a><br/><p>*SPOILERS*<br /><br />"Lord of War" is a genuine cinematic rarity: a mainstream black comedy that doesn't soften its material or compromise its vision to cater to audience sensibilities.  Nicholas Cage plays the world's foremost private small arms dealer, whose key to success lies in the fact that he never chooses sides in any armed conflict, opting instead to be an equal opportunity "merchant of death" to all.  For Yuri Orlov, peace is the only real enemy, and if innocent people have to die to keep him in clover, well, hell, he didn`t make this world, and there`s no reason why he shouldn`t get his if everybody else is getting theirs.<br /><br />Like a master chef working his way to the heart of an artichoke, writer/director Andrew Niccol peels back the layers of his story to reveal the truths of the international gunrunning trade.  Yuri is a chilling and disturbing character precisely because he is so utterly ordinary and difficult to read.  Niccol does not portray him as evil incarnate, but, rather, as a reasonably well-adapted family man who just happens to be good at what he does and has the requisite capacity for self-rationalization that allows him to do his job and still live with himself.  To his own way of thinking, Yuri is really no different from the man who sells tobacco or automobiles - both products, he explains, that actually result in the deaths of more people than firearms - then goes home to the love and adoration of his wife and kids.  Yuri doesn't sell arms because he had an unhappy childhood or out of any sense of entitlement because he feels the world has treated him badly.  He simply knows that if he weren't doing business with these murderous dictators - or as they like to call themselves "freedom fighters" - around the world, somebody else would be.<br /><br />Most of the dark humor of the film comes from the detached, flippant and unemotional commentary Yuri provides as the film's narrator.  He is quick to point out the ironies and absurdities inherent in so much of the arms business, and it is only the gruesome seriousness of the consequences that makes us catch our throats as we laugh.  And Niccol certainly makes it clear that Yuri is only small potatoes compared to the governments who put far more weaponry into the hands of thugs and mercenaries than Yuri ever does.  That little detail, snuck into a title card in the final moments, is the ultimate depressing reality Niccol uses to bring down the curtain on his film.  In fact, Niccol bravely refuses to "redeem" his character at the end.  Yuri loses just about everything and everyone he cares about at the end thanks to his activities, but the world goes on and he's decided he's going to go right on along with it.  And why in the world not?  Selling arms is "just what he does."<br /><br />In a very nuanced and balanced performance, Cage conveys just the right note of dispassionate detachment without ever becoming either too callous or too maudlin.  Yuri seems to genuinely like people and obviously loves his parents, his drug addict brother, his wife and his young son.  That only makes his ability to compartmentalize his morality that much more frightening.  Ethan Hawke gives a strong performance as the Javert-like Interpol agent obsessed with bringing Yuri to international justice, and Bridget Moynihan is stoic and sweet as the beautiful young wife who is willing to turn a blind eye to Yuri`s activities for only so long before finally confronting her husband.<br /><br />Funny as well as chilling, "Lord of War" will give you a whole new terrifying perspective on how the world actually works.</p></br><a href="../users/ARA48345JZPZR.html">ARA48345JZPZR</a><br/><p>This sharp, incisive, and darkly funny movie about the career of a Ukrainian born American gunrunner was probably too cynical to find acceptance with a general audience.  Its central character is an amoral, conscience-challenged arms dealer who finds it impossible to leave his chosen profession no matter the cost to himself or the people around him because "he's good at it".<br /><br />Despite all of Nicholas Cage's inherent charm, this guy is hard to like, especially as the progress of the film will demonstrate his gaining the world and losing his soul and everything else that matters to him.  Films with disturbing protaganists usually don't do well, and judging by a lot of the negative reviews I see here, I think this was a prime example of that response.<br /><br />Most Americans probably don't even recognize or contemplate the fact that our government is the largest arms dealer in the world.  Followed of course, as pointed out in the movie, by all the rest of the UN Security Council (China, France, Great Britain, Russia).<br /><br />You can take the stance that Nic Cage's Yuri does in the film of "if I don't do it someone else will" or you can wonder would any of the suffering of, especially, the third world be relieved if arms dealing wasn't so easy, prevalent, and cheap.  Yuri is not sociopathic as many have labeled him in their reviews, he is doggedly amoral.  He takes no sides, he deals to whoever has the cash.  His chief rival admonishes him that he must take sides.  But is that any real option or just more of the same rationale to assauge one's conscience?<br /><br />At any rate, I for one wasn't bored, and I found the writing sharp and insightful and fascinating as it recounts in dispassionate detail the rise of a world class arms dealer.  Extremely well played by Cage, he somehow remains detached from the consequences of his actions for a long while, until all the dark and cynical humor coalesces in the end to a detailing of the harsh tragedy the trade really engenders.<br /><br />The writer/director has created a stylish piece that actually bites into a subject worth thinking about, and takes us into a ruthless and cold world we know little about. Recommended for those wanting something different. 4-1/2 stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>This was more of a disturbing eye opener than an enjoyable movie for pure entertainment's sake. However, it makes a valid point, which may have been Hollywood's goal. The power of greed and the futility and brutal price of war. I would have liked a more hopeful ending, but perhaps the intent was a realistic lesson in political unrest and the hands that feed them weapons of 'mass destruction'.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></br><a href="../users/A328S9RN3U5M68.html">A328S9RN3U5M68</a><br/><p>Director/writer Andrew Niccol makes films with layers of meaning, the kind that find us laughing at inappropriate moments because contemporary life is like that: what on the surface seems like an entertaining story has very dark roots.  His previous strange films include 'The Terminal', 'The Truman Show', and 'Gattaca' and now LORD OF WAR  takes its place in that arena of black comedy.  Niccol really releases his last spear when at the end of the film there is a statement 'Based on Actual Facts' and at that point the film takes on an altogether new significance.<br /><br />Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage) and his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) immigrate to the US to Little Odessa with their parents (Shake Tukhmanyan and Jean-Pierre Nshanian) who have posed as Jews to escape the Ukraine in 1980 - before Glasnost.  Yuri is bright and sees gunrunning as a lucrative business and after his first tiny success in the gang infested Little Odessa, he convinces his dreamy-eyed brother to be his partner.  The business grows exponentially as Yuri discovers his best customers are countries at war: in time he is wealthy, has married his dream sweetheart Ava (Bridget Moynahan) and settles in as one of the more successful gunrunners in the world.  He buys weapons from stockpiled American ordnances after the US has 'finished' a war and sells them to Eastern European, African and South American revolutionaries.  He is tracked/stalked by Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke) who in his role as a government agent is determined to stop Yuri's dispersal of deadly weapons that result in needless deaths when disseminated to countries in the throes of political change.<br /><br />Though Yuri is first for business, he does care deeply about his wife and child, and about Vitaly whose entry into the world of wealth is soon squandered on a cocaine addiction requiring frequent detox.  Yuri is not a mean spirited man: he sees his business as just that, salesmanship of items for which there is a huge demand and he does not see himself as the perpetrator of violence.  His life has moments of compassion, many moments of financial success, moments of pride in being the gifted gun-runner he has become, and moments of introspection. He hobnobs with dictators, revolutionaries, fellow gunrunners and the law.  The resolution of the  story is not an end but merely a tapering off.<br /><br />The film is narrated by Yuri and for the first part sounds almost comedic - until the visual depiction of the killings are on screen.  Niccol appears to be showing us a factual business that is legal in the eyes of the government ('Washington encourages gunrunners to take care of aspects of world control they can't be seen as condoning') and it is his gift to drive his message home about how human lives are wasted for the sake of business and weapons proliferation.  The film is painful to absorb on this level.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage gives a powerful performance as the opportunistic Yuri and the criminally under-used Jared Leto once again proves his fine-honed acting skills as the drugged addled innocent Vitaly. Likewise Bridget Moynahan is excellent as the wife who elects not to question her source of wealth.  Key cameos are keenly provided by Ian Holms and Eaamonn Walker.  The film is rapid-fire paced, the cinematography is excellent, and the impact of the film is powerful.  It is unusual for  a director to take on topics this controversial and end up with a film this entertaining.  Recommended.

Through some of the deadliest war zones, Yuri struggles to stay one step ahead of a relentless Interpol agent, his business rivals, even some of his customers who include many of the world's most notorious dictators. Finally, Yuri must also face his own conscience. This movie is not much of an anti-war or anti-bush or anti-guns movie. It was much deeper than that. It was about doing things that we aren't necessarily proud of for personal gain; this is something that we all face. Also, at the end the movie mentions that the top 5 nations that export weapons are the United States, France, Britain, China, and Russia. It then says that these are the only permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. That is an interesting fact. I urge you to see this because it is not a movie you watch, it is yourself that you watch.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDNTB7377YH2.html">A1CDNTB7377YH2</a><br/><p>This is another brilliant performance by Nicolas Cage a Ukranian immigrant arms dealer who lives a secret life from his family.  The movie is fun throughout and raises a lot of moral questions.  Cage is basically a nice guy who is in "business" because he is "good" at what he does.  When he is made to see what his work is causing, he has to choose between his "career" and doing what is right.</p></br><a href="../users/A2JHHYYOOO4DS6.html">A2JHHYYOOO4DS6</a><br/><p>True to life portrayal of what takes place in the "underground world" while everyone else goes about their suburban business. Here the movie shows us how the "arms dealing" involves the politician, suburbian housewife, immigrants and poor youths living in developing countries. We get to see who does most of the work, who benefits and the danger it involves for those at the less powerful end of the equation. I can't quite call this entertainment....nothing to laugh about here. The five stars are for the acting (Nicolas Cage rocks) and the story telling.</p></br><a href="../users/A39CX0EE4BZCZC.html">A39CX0EE4BZCZC</a><br/><p>This was a very pleasant surprise, far better than I had ever hoped, filled with fabulous cinematography and riveting story about the life of arms dealer during the 1980s and '90s.. Those who appreciate an interesting story and great visuals will like this one.<br /><br />Nicholas Cage was terrific as the lead character, "Yuri Orlov." I loved his narration, too. How much of what he said is true, I have no idea, but it's fascinating stuff.<br /><br />I felt those visuals, combined with the outstanding acting and always-interesting story made this a good film. It also proved you don't need action every two minutes to keep a film involving for the audience. This has just the right amount of drama, suspense, action, romance and, yes, even humor.<br /><br />I do have to warn some that the message is a pessimistic one: that evil always wins in the world. According to Bible of "Yuri," in the end, the meek won't inherit the earth; the arms dealers will and that evil rules, so why fight it and yourself over it? Wow, what uplifting words to live by.<br /><br />Outside of Yuri's wife "Ava" (Bridget Moynahan) and the man who pursues him, "Jack Valentine" (Ethan Hawke) no one in here has much in the way of high-ground morals. At least they made the lawman an honest; that's rare in films today.<br /><br />Amir Mokri is the cinematographer and Andrew Niccol, the director, who combined to make this movie look so stylish and beautiful to see. Looking at Mokri's resume, I see he's done a number of stylish films. Niccol hasn't directed much but what he has also offers interesting visuals.<br /><br />Looking at the front and back cover of the DVD might make you think this is just another of these brainless action flicks, but it is not. This is solid film, despite the pessimism.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>Perhaps my five-star rating for Nicolas Cage's "Lord of War" has to do with exceeding expectations.  I haven't been a big fan of much of Cage's recent action-hero work, and I didn't have high hopes for this latest effort.  What could the same guy who has lately focused on dreck like "National Treasure," "Gone in 60 Seconds," and "Windtalkers" have to say about the world of gun trafficking.<br /><br />Fortunately, Cage has a heck of a lot to say about it, and it's obvious that he's pretty steamed.  Using an intelligent, informed, and sarcastic tone reminiscent of David O. Russell's "Three Kings," "Lord of War" dives into the cynical, mercenary world of international gun trafficking.<br /><br />From a bravura opening credit sequence that follows a bullet through the manufacturing process to shipping to the brain of a young African combatant, "Lord of War" makes no bones about its dark subject matter.  Indeed, "Lord of War" has been criticized for being a heavy-handed film.  That may be true, but many great movies hit hard.  Why should a movie about gun-running be any different?<br /><br />Cage stars as Yuri Orlov, a Ukranian emigrant whose family lives in anonymous mediocrity in "Little Odessa," the Ukranian enclave near Queens in the early 1980s.  Witness to a Russian mob hit job, Orlov has an epiphany when he sees the hundreds of bullet casings left on the floor by the assassins' weapons -- why can't I sell these things?<br /><br />The major point this movie makes is that for all the headlines grabbed by nuclear weapons and arms treaties, "the real weapon of mass destruction" is the AK-47 and similar small arms.  These weapons are more prevalent in and responsible for the cesspools of the world (such as Liberia under Baptiste, a locale that the movie somewhat revels in) than any nuclear warhead.<br /><br />Using a gift for business and family connections (an uncle is a military hero and high-ranking officer in the Soviet army), Orlov starts from nothing and becomes one of the world's leading arms dealers.  The 1990s were a dream opportunity for the ambitious arms dealer, as the collapsed Soviet Union had billions in military hardware sitting around, but nobody was minding the store.  And war in the Balkans and especially Africa made sure there were hot markets everywhere.  Soon, Orlov has it all - millions of dollars, a trophy wife (Bridget Moynahan), and one of those Manahattan apartments that reek of success.<br /><br />"Lord of War" follows a somewhat conventional rags-to-riches-to-loss-of-soul plotline, but there are many twists along the way.  Sure, there are some developments you can see coming (one shot lingers way too long on a vehicle, giving you a clue that it's going to blow up in a couple of seconds . . . which it does), and let's just concede that Nicolas Cage and Jared Leto do not look like siblings.<br /><br />But let's not deny that "Lord of War" has some original, intelligent moments.  Yuri is a brilliant businessman and criminal, and can think on his feet.  He switches the identity of a cargo ship as Interpol agents (led by an earnest Ethan Hawke) swoop in, and he disposes of an entire planeload of small arms in Africa just before Hawke shows up again.  This scene is followed by a masterpiece, as an entire cargo plane gets dismantled by local scavengers in less than 24 hours.  "Lord of War" looks and feels authentic, and that authenticity leaves a cold pit in your stomach long after its cynical and surprising ending.<br /><br />If nothing else, Cage's effort in "Lord of War" has reminded me that he has been in so many lower-profile gems, such as "Adaptation," "Bringing Out the Dead," and of course, "Leaving Las Vegas."  George Clooney once said that he got involved with the atrocious "Batman" franchise (atrocious before "Batman Begins" came along, that is) because if he made a big blockbuster, the studios would let him make "little movies" like "O Brother, Where Art Thou" and "Syriana."  I guess that excuses Cage's involvement in "Gone in 60 Seconds."  A little.</p></br><a href="../users/A29Y34ALWJUGB5.html">A29Y34ALWJUGB5</a><br/><p>This movie is in many ways a first of its kind, and in many ways it isn't. Lord of War deals with gunrunning, something I've never seen in movies to this scale. For that, I have to give this movie one extra star. But at the same time, this movie has a lot of similarities to Blow, by forcing us to cheer for the bad guy who is doing nothing but contributing to the destruction of the world. Only instead of cocaine, the Lord of War deals in AK-47s.<br /><br />This movie follows the story of Yuri Orlov as he first discovers the profits to be gained in dealing in black-market weapons, and then as he learns the dangers of continuing in the trade. Though surely an intelligent man, he's also one-sighted; all he cares about is how and who to sell his weapons to, or how to gain more weapons at cheap prices. Hell, the day his son first walks is also the day the Cold War officially ends. Do you think he'd be excited about the first steps of his son? Nope, he cares about the massive surplus of Russian weapons left behind because of the ending of the Cold War. Despite all that, he's able to avoid Interpol for years on end, and gets himself involved with one of the most legendary and evil dictators in history, Andre Baptiste.<br /><br />This is a movie of screwed up moral issues. Yuri gets into your head during this movie, and we believe that, though he wants war, he doesn't want death. If he had it his way, he would wish for all the weapons he sold to "miss" there target. And he's just such a lovable character. He risks his life daily for what he believes, no matter how off-base those beliefs are, and wants nothing more than to continue supporting his family. He's obviously intelligent. And he's funny, in a morbid sort of way.<br /><br />In the end, though, this is a movie of acquired tastes. If you have no interest in guns (like me), or do not wish to glorify them, then this obviously isn't the movie for you. But if you have a high tolerance for things such as this, then get Lord of War. It's a good movie with a style all its own, and one based off of true events.</p></br><a href="../users/A2UKC6QFG9L5GV.html">A2UKC6QFG9L5GV</a><br/><p>What I liked in "Lord of War" is that it's rather ambiguous. I don't know whether to feel for Cage's character or resent him. Anyway the movie leaves an uneasy feeling after itself which seemed a bit strange and not usual for a relatively big-budget, major hollywood film. You can't even tell if it has a happy ending or not.<br /><br />"Lord of War" is totally truthful, maybe some things were slightly exaggerated, but in general I think noone will have doubts that all shown in film is exactly the way it is in real life. Being myself from Russia I can tell all the parts about selling Russian and Ukranian arms are true, after the Soviet Union fell to pieces there were immense amounts of tanks, cannons, different weapons and ammunition stolen and sold nobody knows where to. Well, not only 15 years ago - there are lots of weapons being stolen and sold nowdays in Russia. In every country that's at war (and Russia now is at war with Chechnia) there are many possibilities to earn money selling guns.<br /><br />The only thing that was not truthful in the film is HOW Russia and its people were shown. It just made me laugh, I recalled old American movies of a cold-war period that depicted Russians in a very funny way. Actually noone talks like that and behaves like that. But if you've never been here I think it looks just fine. I've never been to Africa, and African scenes looked fine to me although now I think they might also have some flaws.<br /><br />Generally speaking "Lord of War" is about choices we make, and it demonstrates vividly how these choices affect our lives on business and personal level. About acting I have to say Nicolas Cage is doing his usual work, nothing extraordinary, Jared Leto - the same story. But I was blown away by Ethan Hawke - he's totally believable, seems like he's a real interpol agent put on screen.<br /><br />I think it's difficult not to like this movie - it's too serious, thought-provoking and powerful. Definately worth a look.</p></br><a href="../users/AQP1VPK16SVWM.html">AQP1VPK16SVWM</a><br/><p>: The rise and fall (and rise again) of Yuri Orlov arms dealer is the focus of Andrew Niccol's acidic (writer of "The Truman Show" and writer-director of "SimOne", "Gattaca") unfocused blend of satire and action in "Lord of War".  Yuri has no hidden agenda beyond making money unlike his rival Simeon Weisz (Ian Holm) who lives to influence the way the wind of power blows. Oh and Yuri's also got an Interpol agent (Ethan Hawke) on his trail as well. Things aren't going so well right now for Yuri even though he's raking in record profits. Recalling Stanley Kubrick's black humor classic Nicholas Cage portrays Yuri as the ultimate salesman-he could be selling pharmaceuticals or a car but he's decided to be "the merchant of death".  "Lord of War" is a deft mix of action, drama and satire. With actors Jared Leto as Yuri's confused drug dependent younger brother and Bridget Moynahan as his seemingly oblivious wife the film lights up the screen combining brilliant visual motifs with top notch acting, writing and direction. The opening sequence where we follow a bullet from "birth" to "death" is a riveting powerful sequence.<br /><br />A very nice sharp transfer for "Lord of War" the film looks quite good with rich colors and an active 6.1 mix DTS audio mix, a 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround Ex mix and an audio commentary by writer/director Andrew Niccol on a 2.0 mix. The audio comes across crystal clear.<br /><br /> First two criticisms about the product itself not the quality of the film or special features. 1) I hate the packaging of this two disc edition. It looks cheap and sucks big time.  Once you slide out the two disc set from the cardboard sleeve you'll find the two discs housed in a cheap cardboard case with a disc holder glued in the middle. It looks very tacky. The single disc edition at least appears to come in an Amray hardcase. 2) The single disc edition has no extras, zero. This recalls the time when movies were released on DVD a decade ago with just the feature film. This nasty trend didn't start with but was most noticeable with Steven Spielberg's "War of the Worlds". All major studios stop doing this it confuses consumers (some people who want the editions with extras can't find them or, worse yet, buy the single disc sets and then get upset. It's ticking off the customer. Lion's Gate this is an idiotic move. Don't do it again. If you're going to put out a two disc edition do it right-put in a two disc Amray case WITH a booklet vs. these cheapo looking cardboard containers. Steven Spielberg should have been ashamed and Lion's Gate you should be too.<br /><br />The first disc has two special features. The first is an intelligent and informative commentary track by writer/director Andrew Niccol. Niccol's an intelligent and passionate writer/director. Most of the monologue focuses on production details but there is a good amount of other things discussed as well that Niccol learned during the research for his film. Although Niccol's commentary is intermittent and quiet it's intelligent and focused. The second extra on the first disc is an Easter egg if you click on the Amnesty International logo. Nicholas Cage appears in a plea to prevent the continue sales of arms. He discusses the impact that it has in terms of human life.<br /><br />The second disc of this DVD features most of the special features. The most important one is the documentary ""Making a Killing"" which takes a look at the true cost of selling arms. These people that do it look at themselves as businessmen but they are, in reality, nothing more than leeches living off of the suffering of humanity. Featuring interviews with William Schultz of Amnesty International and Philip Coyle a Senior Advisor with the World Security Institute. As Coyle points out the U.S. is one of the largest arms sellers and we end up going to war against many of the countries that end up eventually buying many of these killing machines. Dr Sylvester Rowe Executive Director of the United States also appears as narrating documentary footage shot in many of these Third World countries where tin dictators pay for arms to stay in control while their populations starve. It's an informative excellent featurette. We also find out the fate of children in these countries who end up becoming young soldiers and victims of their society. "Weapons of the Trade" features a gallery of the various weapons seen in the film, a text history of the weapon and the specs. "The Making of `Lord of  War'" is a marvelous behind-the-scenes featurette. We hear comments from director Niccol about what inspired him to make this acidic satire and what attracted the various actors to the project. There's also a photo gallery, trailers for the film and seven deleted scenes that round out the special features on the second disc.<br /><br />Although it's an imperfect film, "Lord of War" is still a deft entertaining and acidic satire on the obsession our world has with weapons of destruction. Cage gives a brilliant performance as Yuri the arms dealer and has able support from Jared Leto, Ian Holm, Ethan Hawke, Bridget Moynahan  and Eamonn Walker as a psychotic despot leader. It's well worth watching although, depending on your political beliefs, you'll be either outraged at Niccol's liberal point of view or delighted to find someone who agrees with you.</p></br><a href="../users/A2NJO6YE954DBH.html">A2NJO6YE954DBH</a><br/><p>"Lord of War" begins by following a bullet from the moment it is manufactured to the point at which it is fired and kills somebody on the other side of the globe.  I think it is obvious that is what is going to be the payoff to the opening sequence, but I also think that you know the victim is going to be instantly recognizable as an innocent, because clearly selling arms is a bad thing.  But the point of this 2005 movie from writer-director Andrew Niccol is that selling arms is also big business.  How big he saves for the final punch line of the film, which makes sure nobody finishes watching "Lord of War" without getting the point.<br /><br />Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) is a Ukrainian immigrant who discovers that his gift in this world is selling arms (a.k.a. "gun running").  He teams up with his brother, Vitaly (Jared Leto), until they are paid off one time with cocaine and a kilo is appropriated for personal use.  Pursuing Yuri is Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke), an American agent working with INTERPOL, whose Achilles heel is that he will not break the law, although you have to admire his interpretation of holding a suspect in custody for 24 hours before charging them.  Yuri always knows exactly where he stand vis-a-vis the law, but I must saw that he is perfectly polite when yanking Valentine's chain.  Yuri's own Achilles heel would be his wife, the former Ava Fontaine (Bridget Monyahan), a super model that he is able to wine and dine into becoming his wife.  She remains oblivious to what he does, but if Yuri has to choose between his wife and his work, you are inclined to think he would go with the latter.  After all, the fall of the Soviet Union and the arms bonanza that creates in the former republics is a lot more important to Yuri than the fact his son has started walking.<br /><br />However, there are two people who seem to pose a bigger threat to Yuri.  One is Simeon Weisz (Ian Holm), the king of the arms dealers, who sells not for the money but to dictate the balance of power in the world by picking sides.  Yuri refuses to pick sides.  Yuri maintains he is oblivious to what the guns, grenades, tanks and other military hardware are ultimately used for by the people who buy them (the same cannot be said for Vitaly).  Weisz wants to squash Yuri, but whether it is for economic or ideological reasons is not clear.  The other threat is one of Yuri's biggest customers, Andre Baptiste Sr. (Eamonn Walker), the dictator of Liberia, who is crazy enough that he might blow Yuri away on a whim with a gun that has not been sold yet (or by sending him a couple of local women from a country that has one of the highest AIDS rates in the world).  Since the film focuses so much on Yuri's ride, you know that there is going to have to be a fall.  The question is, how far and how hard?<br /><br />Niccol wrote and directed "S1mOne" and "Gattaca," and also wrote "The Terminal" and "The Truman Show," so clearly there is always some important point to be made in his films. "Lord of War" is one that defines a problem without attempting to offer a solution.  Indeed, the punch line at the end of this one, which is reinforced by the facts related before the end titles, makes it clear no solution is possible.  Yuri's final words put a spin on what has transpired, but you have to think people in the audience are just focusing on the horror and the madness of it all.  Then again, Cage's performance makes you root for Yuri despite the fact that what he is doing is bad, which makes him a bad person.<br /><br />The evil of being a "Lord of War" is the overriding point of the film and that judgment is supposed to overcome some of the problems with the narrative.  Yuri does a lot of the work in the field by himself, which seems a tad dangerous to me, but I guess part of the attraction here is that he is glib enough to survive living on the razor's edge.  But I really do not understand why he wants his brother with him ever again once he clearly becomes a liability.  Again, it is Cage's performance that forgives a lot of these concerns and Niccol does have a payoff for the big set up.  The results are not great, but certainly well worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/A19VMQDCB4HZ9P.html">A19VMQDCB4HZ9P</a><br/><p>Andrew Niccol's Lord of War is a very good piece of filmmaking. Niccol takes a serio-comic look at the machinations of the necessary evil that are freelance international arms dealers. This subject has been done before but with disastrous results with the Chevy Chase and Gregory White comedy vehicle, Deal of the Century. Niccol's film is much better due to its subject matter having more resonance in this era of post-Cold War and post-9/11. It also is inherently better due to another fine performance out of Nicholas Cage who has to have cornered the market on deadpan delivery of dialogue that has full comedic timing and at the same time fills a scene with dramatic weight.<br /><br />Lord of War is the story of one Yuri Orlov. A Ukrainian-born American who grows up in what he calls a different type of hell from communist USSR: Brighton Beach, USA. The film encompasses' Yuri's lowly beginnings as an amateur arms dealer selling to the Ukrainian mob enforcers in his neighborhood. Yuri is a quick learner and soon convinces his younger brother Vitaly (played by Jared Leto) to be his right-hand man. He needs someone to watch his back during his negotiations and sales and sees his brother as the best man for the job. Most of the film is told through as a flashback as Yuri narrates observations he'd made throughout his career as an international arms dealer willing to straddle the line between legal and illegal. In fact, he becomes so good at evading authorities that he soons goes from an amateur being dismissed by the Old Guard arms dealers (one played as an almost conscience to Yuri's amoral ways by Sir Ian Holm)to one who adapts fastest to the new world order of small conflicts that erupts as a consequence to the end of the Cold War. It is during these turbulent times that Yuri develops a business and almost symbiotic relationship with a Liberian warlord named Andres Baptiste, Sr (a chilling and stand out performance by Eamonn Walker) and his even more psychotic son Andres, Jr.<br /><br />We see Yuri from his lowyly beginnings to the height of his power as an elite in the shadowy world of secondary arms dealing. This is even made more pointed when his best customer, warlord Andres Baptiste points out that his people and enemies call him the lord of war, but he believes Yuri deserves that title even more. Yuri is the Lord of War as he sells to both sides in a conflict and tries to justify his amoral business practices by proclaiming that if he didn't sell them the weapons then a dozen others will. Even as he keeps an emotional detachment from the suffering and destruction his practices has wrought worldwide, especially in war-torn West Africa, Yuri's life is complicated even more by the dogged efforts of Interpol agent Jack Valentine (played with boy-scout righteousness by Ethan Hawke) who has made busting Yuri his goal in life. Add Vitaly who has become addicted to cocaine in no small part to his participation in Yuri's business dealings and a trophy wife in Ava Fontaine (played by Bridget Moynahan in a thankless role) all goes to make Yuri's personal and business life another hell he has put himself into.<br /><br />Yuri as a character would've become too much of a caricature if not for the deadpan performance by Nicholas Cage. Cage infuses the character with an almost resigned personality. A permanent ennui at having witnessed atrocities he himself might have caused with his arms dealing, but at the same time know that this is the only thing he's really best at. Cage has lived off playing such characters and even brings back glimpses of a similar but more powerful performance he had in Leaving Las Vegas. Both the character in that film and in Niccol's work have a resigned attitude about how their life has been, but where one gives in to his ennui and becomes suicidal, the Yuri character cannot stop doing what he does even if it meant losing everything he loved and being left disowned and alone.<br /><br />The film is very blunt about the evil that is the international arms trade, but Niccol and his writers have also pointed out that it is an evil that could be stopped if not for the major governments who have used these individuals as a necessary evil to push their strategic and political agenda for the rest of the world. Lord of War doesn't condemn arms dealers like Yuri Orlov. What it does condemn is the political atmosphere and machinations behind the global scene that makes such people necessary. Even though Orlov is not a true person he does seem based off the actual life and events of one Victor Bout whose life and career as an arms dealer mirrors that of Yuri's.<br /><br />Niccol's Lord of War is not a perfect film, but it is very timely in this new age of a world become more complicated with the end of the Cold War with terrorists, warlords and atrocities committed by the poorests of nations and its people. The heavy-handed message told through the film is saved by the excellent work by Nicholas Cage as the title character with great support from Eamonn Walker as Liberian Warlord Baptiste. Lord of War may not be perfect but its thoughtprovoking and to a certain extent very entertaining.</p></br><a href="../users/A3M2WW0PO34B94.html">A3M2WW0PO34B94</a><br/><p>I'm going to borrow an analogy used in the recent Supreme Court confirmation hearings for a moment. When Nicholas Cage comes up to bat, he frequently hits singles or misses, but when he hits a homerun, it is usually out of the ballpark. Cage has certainly made his share of crappy ("Gone in 60 Seconds") or mediocre films ("The Family Man"), but he has also, occasionally, made really good films. Films that he should be proud of. Films that would do a Nicholas Cage Film Festival proud. "Lord of War" is such a film.<br /><br />Directed by Andrew Niccol (the writer of "The Truman Show" and the writer/director of the underappreciated "Gattaca" and the rightfully forgotten "Simone"), "War" is a dark comedy that falters only once or twice. This coupled with a terrific performance by Cage make it a memorable film. Whether it becomes a remembered film has yet to be seen.<br /><br />Yuri Orlov (Cage) and his brother Vitale (Jared Leto) are second generation Ukrainian immigrants helping their Catholic parents run a Kosher restaurant in the Little Odessa neighborhood of New York. One day, Yuri witnesses a gang shootout and realizes that money can be had from selling guns. He talks Vitale into partnering with him and they start a business taking them into war zones across the globe. As the money rolls in, each spends on their vice of choice; Vitale starts snorting profit through his nose and Yuri romances Eve (Bridget Moynahan), a famous model from the old neighborhood. After they are married, the Cold War ends and business really picks up. A zealous ATF agent (Ethan Hawke) sets his sights on Yuri.<br /><br />Reportedly based on true events, "War" is a fast-paced, darkly comic look at a man we should loathe.<br /><br />Cage's performance is great. The film begins with Yuri breaking the fourth wall; addressing the audience from the screen, talking about his business and his morals ("I never sold guns to Osama Bin Laden. Not on moral grounds, just at that time, his checks were always bouncing.") setting the tone for his character and the film. Throughout the film, Yuri frequently provides narration which is light and breezy, a brilliant counterpoint to the subject matter. This also helps to make his character more memorable, because what he says is usually completely at odds with what we should be feeling or experiencing. Somehow, and I'm not entirely sure how he does it, Cage makes Yuri a sympathetic guy. Yuri is a drug runner who sells weapons and helps keep wars going so he can make more money. He occasionally uses drugs and also cheats on his wife, Eve. Yet, we care for him. When he gets into dangerous situations, we want him to get out safely. How did Cage accomplish this? Part of it is that we see him in dangerous situations. Other people die. The danger is there. Things happen to him. He isn't completely unaffected either. Because we feel for him, we laugh at ourselves for being taken in by this character which in turn adds to the dark humor.<br /><br />Niccol manages to tell a political story, without preaching. We learn or witness as the story unfolds. The beginning sequence, a terrific point of view shot of the journey of a single bullet from manufacture to use also helps to quickly establish what Niccol is trying to do. He uses Yuri as his mouthpiece, serious at times and completely unaffected at others. Because we are watching the events through this character's eyes, it would be impossible for the film to be very preachy. Yuri wouldn't stand around and preach about this or that, so Niccol doesn't either. Even though Yuri frequently makes statements about his impartiality to one conflict or the other, his statements and what he witnesses inform us. Parts of the story are serious and others are satirical. Niccol maintains this blend well throughout faltering only a few times in the last act.<br /><br />The supporting cast is good. Jared Leto is convincing as Vitale, Yuri's coked out, out of control younger brother. Bridget Moynahan is also good as Eve, Yuri's wife, who doesn't face the truth until forced to. Ian Holm makes a brief appearance as an old school gunrunner, Yuri's main competition.<br /><br />Ethan Hawke's role as Agent Valentine is little more than a glorified cameo. Hawke starred in Niccol's first film "Gattaca" and I get the sense they wanted to work together again, no matter the project. It seems as though Valentine is meant to be the character who reflects was we should be feeling, the conscience of the audience. In his few moments on screen, he says what we should say; he displays the disgust we should feel. But the character is, as mentioned, only on screen for a brief period. Thankfully. If the character did work, providing a Yang to balance Cage's Ying, the film would lose a significant amount of its dark humor. It's a small role and odd that they would use his name in the advertisements.<br /><br />"Lord of War" is not a perfect film, but it is a memorable one and it contains a great performance from Nicholas Cage.</p></br><a href="../users/A18OUQEK7IZ2F2.html">A18OUQEK7IZ2F2</a><br/><p>I recently watched this on cable, so I will not be addressing any DVD features, although with two discs, multiple commentaries, a documentary and more, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BYA5GO">this</a> seems the one to get.<br /><br />By most accounts based on real-life Soviet gunrunner Viktor Bout (currently in U.S. custody), Lord of War made twice as much money overseas as it did in America. Certainly, I had never heard of it. With an R rating and plenty of graphic violence not to mention drug use, this is definitely a film for mature audiences.<br /><br />Having said all that, I think this is an excellent film. Unlike many recent examples of Nic Cage pulling down a paycheck, he is both less likable and more believable here. While simultaneously glorifying and dehumanizing Cage's Yuri Orlov, director Andrew Niccol presents a reality where a long line of willing successors is ready to take his place. The world needs guns like it does food or water.<br /><br />This isn't another Bruckheimer/Bay pyrotechnics orgy. While explosions have not been completely excised, Lord of War is actually closer to Oscar-darling Blood Diamond, released over a year later. The latter cost twice as much to make. To be fair, it also earned more than twice as much in revenue.<br /><br />I am not always a proponent of voiceovers, but at least it is consistent in timbre and frequency here. Bridget Moynahan is stunning, Jared Leto is very good as the black sheep brother, however I feel the Interpol agent could have been played by someone with less star power than Ethan Hawke, who for some reason was channeling Peter Berg.<br /><br />The film's opening (the life cycle of a round of ammunition) sets the tone. My other favorite scene is the stripped Antonov An-12. (No spoilers here; see--and enjoy--for yourself.)<br /><br />NOTE:<br /><br />Director Andrew Niccol was said to have purchased real AK-47s for filming because they were cheaper than prop guns. That may be so, at least in the former Eastern Bloc Czech Republic where filming took place, but Niccol is laboring under the misconception that reducing access to firearms will reduce crime in the real world. (As if criminals followed all the rules!) In fact, the opposite is true. American cities like Chicago and Washington, D.C. have historically had much higher incidence of violent crime while also having the highest barriers to individual gun ownership.<br /><br />"I hope the United States takes note that the murder rate is lower where gun availability is lower." [Article link in Comments section below.]</p></br><a href="../users/A3H9JSM1SUTE4O.html">A3H9JSM1SUTE4O</a><br/><p>Andrew Niccol directs Nic Cage as weapons of mass destruction salesman Yuri Orlov who sells ordinance like the medieval church sold indulgences; spare us your morality, please, for church and Yuri, it's only about money.<br /><br />Very dark humor pervades this shocking story of the personal and professional life of a Ukranian man who is in the business of supplying weapons to any country or rebel that can afford them.  For a while his beautiful wife (Bridget Moynahan) is clueless and his drug-addled little brother is a poor choice as a partner.  Amoral and frightening, this glimpse of the black-market gun trade is only bearable by the slight peek of Yuri as a human being and not the monster he has almost completely become.  This is one of Cage's better roles.  Cage seems to understands how the relentless drive for success can kill the last vestiges of a lost humanity.</p></br><a href="../users/A2OFSDJB3MVQ16.html">A2OFSDJB3MVQ16</a><br/><p>I checked to see if this film which I rented from Netflix in HD DVD was available on Amazon in that format and it isn't.  Too bad because this film is one of Nick Cage's better efforts. Produced by him as well, Cage has a great role as an Russian-American who discovers the way to wealth is thru selling arms.  Of course he doesn't figure the enormous cost it will eventually lead him to but that's one of the intriguing outcomes of this absorbing film. The narrative is done in the style of Scorsese's "Goodfellows" and is effective plus the supporting cast (Jared Leto, Ian Holm, Bridget Monihan) is excellent.  Anyway the transfer I saw in HD is excellent and I figure the same goes for the Blu-ray version of this film.  Recommended for Cage enthusiasts!!</p></br><a href="../users/A356RFKNIG043B.html">A356RFKNIG043B</a><br/><p>I liked this on the whole; when the script is good and the director wrote it, things often turn out well. LOW tries to be balanced and not too preachy; the rationalizations actually make some sense. The film downplays the political connections more than is likely true, though, I'd guess (destabilization of third world countries is one of the CIA's favorite tactics, as revealed by many ex-agents in many books, as is the Agency's drug-dealing as a method of both "insurgent" funding and arms trading, as revealed in the Iran/Contra hearings).<br /><br />My main qualm is with Cage, who somehow always seems to invest his characters with less brains and savvy than they deserve. It worked great in Raising Arizona but is wearing thin since then. He's kind of like the unthinking man's James Caan. Cage comes so close sometimes, but I just can't buy him all the way. Here he is solid but never transcends and takes this movie to the next level.<br /><br />Leto is good, as are most of the bit players, especially some of the Africans, who have more presence than some of the stars.<br />LOW does get pretty violent. The violence rarely seems gratuitous, though, so its point gets made.<br />Worth seeing.</p></br><a href="../users/A2GA2SO3YK6CXI.html">A2GA2SO3YK6CXI</a><br/><p>This movie surfaces the subject of illegal arms dealing. Yuri Orlov, played brilliantly by Nicolas Cage, finds his one true talent and with the assistance of his brother he sets out to purchase and sell weapons of all sorts.<br /><br />From the depth of Ukraine immigrant status, Yuri Orlov reaches the top of his trade, supplying weapons to anyone and everyone interested in making a deal.<br /><br />The movie is simply amazing. The cynicism of the dialogue leaves us pondering on, as Mr. Orlov says, the fact that a decent, honest job is done by too many people, with very thin margins, and yet, there are large fortunes to be made selling every kind of weapons he can get his amoral hands on.<br /><br />Since childhood, Mr. Orlov has been in love with a beautiful model and wherever he travels, as he sees the tabloids displaying her image, he focuses in someday possessing this "trophy wife" played by Bridget Moynahan.<br /><br />At first, she is unaware of what he does for a living, and he convinces her that he is a millionaire in his own right, even though he has rented the plane he uses to take her away from a hotel where he had lured her under the disguise of photo opportunity.<br /><br />Orlov's brother, played by Jared Leto, helps him to achieve his goals, but he is disturbed about the consequences of the trade they are in. As he sees countless victims die under the fire of the very weapons they sell, he finds refuge in his cocaine drug addiction, to mask the fact that he is an accomplice.<br /><br />Yuri's cynicism is brilliantly played by Nicholas Cage, as he traffics in the death of thousands, the way other salesman might push vitamins or something good for humanity.<br /><br />Some of the very cynical statements are left for the audience to ponder on the fact that "automobiles, alcohol and tobacco kill more people than weapons of all sorts."<br /><br />Yuri Orlov travels all over the world, visiting a ruthless Liberian dictator, played by Eamonn Walker, who acquires weapons to eliminate any citizen who opposes his oppressive regime. The son is riveted in obtaining Rambo's weapon and even this, Yuri Orlov is able to acquire for him.<br /><br />In the end... when Yuri is put in jail, as he discusses his life with the man who has been after him throughout the film, he says... "My parents disowned me, my wife and child have left me... members of my family are dead... yes... I understand my situation." The reply is priceless... for the persecutor says... "I would send you to hell, but you already live there!"<br /><br />While incredible dark humor is at play with this movie, I would highly recommend this film, for it surfaces the dangers of the arms race, and the high price we pay as nations continue to build arsenals of destruction.</p></br><a href="../users/A34VV92TSLC37R.html">A34VV92TSLC37R</a><br/><p>Lord of War follows the exploits of Yuri Orlov, a Ukranian immigrant to America in the early 1980s.  Yuri decides to get into the gun-running business when he sees an attempted assassination of a ganglord one day in his hometown.  The movie follows Yuri's story over the course of 20 years.  All the highs and lows of the business, and the consequences of his actions.<br /><br />This movie is definitely not an action adventure.  It really is more of a satire; a serious, violent satire, but still a satire.  Somehow, the movie allows, even encourages us, to root for Nicolas Cage's ruthless, exploitative character.  Yuri is a good, deep character, who is aware of his flaws, but he is also aware that gun-running is the one thing he is good at, and he is not so willing to give it up.  Nicolas Cage is obviously a talented actor, and he does a good job here, but nothing that he hasn't done the basics of before.  Jared Leto, who plays Yuri's brother, Vitoli, does an admirable job of playing a distressed, drugged-out, morally aware sidekick to his brother's illegalities.  The best character of the movie, though, is agent Jack Valentine, played by Ethan Hawke.  Valentine appears sparingly, but the scenes that he and Cage share are the best of the movie.  The verbal sparring between the characters is extremely well-written, and has a deep meaning that runs underneath the entire film.<br /><br />Don't watch this movie expecting nonstop action and explosions, watch it for the ideas that it expands on, and the moral dilemmas it exposes.  The film asks many questions, and the answers are complicated.  But one thing is for sure: I enjoyed watching the questions get asked.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Lord of War (Andrew Niccol, 2005)<br /><br />This one flew under the radar, or at least as under the radar as a much-hyped major Hollywood production can. Upon reflection, that's not terribly surprising, given how strong a film it is; good things, it often seems, never flourish in the sandy, sandy soil of Hollywood. And Niccol (Gattaca) has created a good thing here.<br /><br />Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage) and his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) are arms dealers operating in the grey areas of the law. Or they are until Vitaly develops a rather nasty drug habit and goes into rehab, leaving Yuri to fly solo-- just as the Berlin Wall comes down and the arms market takes off. Yuri is being dogged by Jack Valentine (Ethan Hawke), an FBI agent who's sure he's breaking the law.<br /><br />As an action movie, it's kind of fun, interesting, a bit slow at times but watchable all the same. As a chronicle of the slow descent into corruption of a guy who's just trying to make his way in the world, it's incisive, well-done, witty, charming. However, the movie really shines as a survey of the political and economic structure of the world in the nineties. Yuri Orlov is the perfect character to allow Niccol to ruminate on the general anarchic wackiness of a lot of different hot spots at the time. Yuri traipses through the former Soviet Union and Africa, and Niccol follows with his camera, casting light on some very nasty characters who are thinly-veiled (at best) analogues of real dictators. It's good stuff; you probably didn't see it in the theater (very few did), but you can catch what you missed then on DVD now. ****</p></br><a href="../users/A36EW68H08UOCS.html">A36EW68H08UOCS</a><br/><p>Lord of War stars Nicolas Cage as Yuri, a Russian immigrant who finds an unusual professional calling: he decides at an early age that he has what it takes to become an international arms dealer.  The film is "based on a true story" and the accompanying documentary on the DVD makes you believe that the director/writer Andrew Niccol did his homework.  Most of the weapons are cold-war leftovers that Yuri acquires from high-ranking former Soviet military officers looking for a little underhanded capitalism.<br /><br />Jared Leto is featured as Yuri's brother Vitaly and Bridget Moynahan is beautifully believable as Yuri's trophy bride Ava Fontaine.  Ian Holm is very effective as an "old school" arms dealer who first dismisses the upstart Yuri, then approaches him later seeking a partnership.  Eamonn Walker is chilling as the militaristic dictator of Liberia - a nation that was supposed to be founded as a home for descendents of former slaves, now turned into a perpetual high-stakes gang war.  Ethan Hawke shines in his scenes as the "honest cop", an Interpol agent who knows all of Yuri's underhanded dealings, but won't compromise his own integrity or bend the rules to bring Yuri to justice - a fact Yuri exploits more than once.<br /><br />It's not easy watching a film in which the lead character is such a scumbag outlaw, but Cage brings such an easy-going larger-than-life charm to Yuri that you're able to overlook his significant "character flaw" to get through the film.  I remember feeling something similar watching the gangsters in the "Godfather" films.</p></br><a href="../users/A1B05INWIDZ74O.html">A1B05INWIDZ74O</a><br/><p>The acting in this film is well done. They all sell their respective parts. In this movie we follow Yuri Orlov (Nicholas Cage) from his early days in the early 1980s as an immigrant in New York to the present. One day when checking out menu of their family's competition across the street, he is witness to a Russian Mob assassination attempt. Of course the amount of ammo being used grabs Yuri's attention. For he thinks everyone needs bullets. And this is all he needs to try his hand at gun running.<br /><br />He starts off his business by being a reseller of Uzi's in New York and works his way up to arming countries. As Yuri deals his product, the repercussions of his sales are not glossed over. We see the havoc and death they bring. The sad part of the movie is what Yuri says is true; most of what he does is legal. Yuri is a brilliant businessman and criminal, and can think on his feet. The movie has the feel of reality to it.<br /><br />When you see the volumes of arms he sells and the death it brings. It makes a strong statement. But I think the bigger statement is the fact that the five largest arms dealers in the world are the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council itself (U.S., China, France, Great Britain and France). And they continue to sell to whom ever will buy.<br /><br />Watch this movie. There are no spots in where you will be bored. But I will suggest that you do not let your young children watch it, for there are some very bloody and realistic death scenes.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CYOHNGQ1WED1.html">A1CYOHNGQ1WED1</a><br/><p>The Lord of War tracks the adult life of a Russian immigrant, Yuri Orlov, played by Nicholas Cage. To get out of his crappy life in Little Odessa, he begins selling guns to local mobsters. His business becomes larger and larger until he is the top gun runner in the world, besting a rival who had looked down on him. When communism falls in the Ukraine, he goes to see his uncle who is a Colonel in the Red army. Together they sell Russian guns, tanks, helicopters and missiles because the government is in such disarray no one is watching.<br /><br />Along the way, Orlov marries his dreamgirl, a model and struggles to help his brother stay clean of drugs and alcohol. The wife knows her husband isn't on the up and up but doesn't want to know because she says she doesn't want him to lie to her. In the end, when she finds everything out and leaves him, it's hard to have a lot of sympathy for her. Ethan Hawke plays a Javert-like Interpol agent trying desperately to put Yuri away. He knows he's guilty but can never get the proof he needs.<br /><br />This was a very well-made film. All the performances are top grade and it's a beautiful movie to look at. There is an undercurrent of very black humor throughout a serious story. The end result of what happens with all the weapons that are bought is shown bluntly and can be quite jarring. Cage does a good job playing a man fighting with the immorality of what he does while knowing, as he says in the movie, that he's good at it, and if he quits, someone else will take his place tomorrow. There are missteps along the way; a few plot points you'll see coming before they happen and some of the music choices were too obvious, but overall this was a very good movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A20IIR0422G3A5.html">A20IIR0422G3A5</a><br/><p>`Lord of War', written and directed by Andrew Niccol, starring (and co-produced by) Nicolas Cage is a slightly better than average Nicholas Cage vehicle which at least some reviewers represented among the blurbs on the cover seem to misuderstand. At least two blurbs describe the film as a `thriller', but it is definitely not a `thriller' in any normal sense of the term. My best description of the nature of the movie may be a `biopic' based on a parody of a `New Yorker' profile of a fictional arms dealer.<br /><br />The movie is much more about motives, personality, and development of the Cage character, a Ukranian emigrant to `little Odessa' in Brooklyn who develops his `shady' to illegal arms trade from selling Uzi's to mercenaries to selling tanks and attack helicopters to African insurgents and strong men. The flick is not a thriller because aside from a few short incidents, there is never any enduring threat to the principle characters or any great mystery about Cage's character or his enterprises. By comparison, the great thriller, `The Usual Suspects' creates a big puzzle from the very beginning which grows with developments until it is resolved only in the very last scene. Nothing like that is going on here. There is even very little mystery or suspense over whether Cage's character will succeed with his romantic campaign.<br /><br />This movie is all about the principle character's morality, the morality, or more accurately the strong legal sense of his antagonist, the Interpol agent played by Ethan Hawke, and the advice the principle gets from veteran arms dealer played by Ian Holm, and the consequences of following Holm's advice.<br /><br />This movie is not quite as engaging as Cages's best flicks, such as `Adaptation', `Matchstick Man', or even the action movie `Con Air'. But, it is a whole lot better than some of Cage's stinkers such as `War Birds'.<br /><br />Actully, one of the most interesting things about the movie is what we learn about the illegal weapons trade and how it was affected by the end of the cold war. One almost expects these types of characters to be either outright scoundrels or inept. Cage is neither. He succeeds in escaping from the dual perils of the law and his unsavory customers.<br /><br />Unlike `Con Air' and even `Adaptation', this movie suffers a bit from the rather light cast. There is no one like  John Malkovich against which he can play.<br /><br />All in all, this is still a worthwhile movie, although the DVD extras are remarkably slim, probably because there is another 2 disk version, of course, for a higher price!</p></br><a href="../users/A3R36DZQEWNVJ1.html">A3R36DZQEWNVJ1</a><br/><p>Nicolas Cage (Face/Off, Family Man, upcoming Weather Man) stars as Yuri Orlov, who is an arms dealer who sells guns to people in other countries....where their for he gets money.

Not at all. Yes its a documentary thinly disguised as a drama, and a very good drama at that, but its facts are most certainly correct, and going by the commentary, and the actual  documentary on disc two, this is a watered down version of the facts.<br /><br />The Film's audio is great, the CGI is almost invisible, as the director mentions. This is one case where the CGI  assists in the story telling.<br /><br />Disc one is straightforward, the film with Commmentary, and in some awesome DTS  audio.<br /><br />Disc two has a collection of deleted  scenes that SHOULD  have been kept in my view, and I do not know why they were sliced. The making of feature is very revealing, and even shows how even this film could not have been made without  arms dealers.The documentary on the arms trade is scary because it really shows just how correct the film is, and in fact how understated the film is, if not less than the truth... since if the truth were shown, no one would buy it. Also, there is an interactive guide to the guns of the film, quite a good addition.<br /><br />If you do not want to have information on the trade that this film talks about, then get the one disc version.However, the two disc version is an awesome work, and a great film done outside of the regular studio system.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MFNDNS1L7D16.html">A2MFNDNS1L7D16</a><br/><p>Immorality suggest he (Cage) has a conscience, however bad, about what he is doing: selling death to anyone with $$$.

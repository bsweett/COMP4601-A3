The story line is about mumble a penguin that dances but can not sing. In penguin society everything is based on how you sing. Because of this he is seen as different and an outcast. The message to accept others is a good one. However, then the move starts with an overtly political message about evil humans and good animals. A children's movie should not deal with politics. The voice acting is great and Elijah Wood is great as Mumble. Still an OK movie. 3/5.</p></br><a href="../users/AY12DBB0U420B.html">AY12DBB0U420B</a><br/><p>I recently viewed two movies on DVD regarding Emperor penguins. One was the documentary "March of the Penguins" and the other was "Happy Feet." I reviewed the "March" DVD and gave it five stars. Amazing film! Next came "Happy Feet."<br /><br />"Happy Feet" is an amazing movie to be sure, but only in one way. The animation is simply awesome. Some of the scenes look so realistic that it's hard to believe it's an animation. In places, the Antarctic landscape looks totally real and the penguins can hardly be distinguished from real Emperor penguins until they start singing and dancing and going through their absurd antics. The animation is really a remarkable feat! I feel like I'll never know what to believe when watching a movie from this time on. No wonder it got an academy award!<br /><br />The content of this remarkable movie, however, was sappy. Sappy, sappy, sappy. The story was weak, to say the least. No it was more than weak; it was ludicrous. How anyone could mix animation this marvelous with a plot this vapid is beyond me. What were they thinking? I don't know, maybe kids might enjoy it. Maybe it's a movie made especially for kids. Who knows? The music was engaging, but the whole story was so insipid that it ruled out any significant enjoyment of the movie. I sat there watching and listening in awe, and feeling ill as the story rolled out. Strange combination. Hmmmmm. Maybe it would have been better with the sound turned off.<br /><br />I'm sorry, folks. Maybe I shouldn't have watched the documentary first. Maybe the right way is to watch the cartoon first. Live in a fantasy world, where penguins walk around behaving like humans and dance and sing. It's an interesting thought. Then watch the "March" documentary and see the conditions as they really are.<br /><br />Gary Peterson</p></br><a href="../users/A3M1NNDD95HR0R.html">A3M1NNDD95HR0R</a><br/><p>Watching this Academy Award winning movie was time well spent.  The lineup was incredible, consisting of such voices as Elijah Wood, Robin Williams, Brittany Murphy, Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman, and Steve Irwin.  Robin Williams was actually the voice of two characters. Well, the things that stand out to me from this movie most are first of all spectacular visuals, and then good music.  It also had a creative storyline and an unexpected twist at the end, which was a nice surprise.  Furthermore, I liked that there was the theme of being different that in the end turned out to be their salvation.  In a way, Mumble the outcast turned out to be a real hero, their savior of sorts.  He really had a knack for tap dancing, and as you may see, the talent comes in very handy.  The baby penguins were adorable, and very hard not to like.  The Leopard Seal evasion sequence was very exciting, and so was the Killer Whale scene.  All in all Happy Feet is a fun film and I am happy to have added it to my movie collection.  I would call it a "family" film except for the suggestive lyrics in one of the songs by Prince called "Kiss".  The lyrics go "You don't have to be beautiful, to turn me on... I just need your body baby, from dusk till dawn".  Other than that, this movie is suitable for kids too.  One can easily overlook those lyrics when weighing in the overall benefit and enjoyment potential from such a film.  If you have young kids, it's your call. Enjoy!</p></br><a href="../users/A3KKM0T1KY42HA.html">A3KKM0T1KY42HA</a><br/><p>Something about singing and dancing captivates young children. Happy Feet is full of singing and dancing...at least half of the movie are happy songs and tapping (happy) feet. So my kids, especially my 3 year old, are happily captivated.<br /><br />Happy Feet is another in the 13, count 'em, 13 CGI movies of 2006. It's a feel-good movie with the ever popular, ever familiar theme of "Judge One Not By His Differences To You And Your Social Circle". It's a nice family film with the all-important adult-asides. But nothing too grown up that kids would pick up on.<br /><br />The picture is just awesome; this computer-generated animation is amazing to see on a high-def TV. It's almost 3D. Unbelievable.<br /><br />There are lots of popular actors lending their voices to Happy Feet, and there are lots of popular songs that everyone can sing along to. Happy Feet is a good movie that you throw in the DVD player and snuggle up with the kids to watch, and your younger kids will want to watch it over and over and over....That's enough added value and incentive right there to add it to your cart.<br /><br />But, in my humble opinion, Happy Feet isn't one of the top 3 of the 13 2006 CGI movies. Maybe it's the overkill of computer animation in 2006 that just didn't get me as excited for Happy Feet by the time it was released at the end of the year as I was for some of the others released earlier in the year.<br /><br />I think the top 3 CGIs of 2006 were, in order: Ice Age 2, The Ant Bully and Cars. But who cares what I think? It's all about the kids, and the kids loved Happy Feet.<br /><br />And in case you were wondering...the 13 CGI movies of 2006 were: Cars, The Wild, Happy Feet, Doogal, Open Season, Monster House, Chicken Little, Barnyard, Over the Hedge, The Ant Bully, Hoodwinked, Ice Age 2 & Flushed Away.<br /><br />Choose your own top 3.</p></br><a href="../users/A33CLVW2K7SL1P.html">A33CLVW2K7SL1P</a><br/><p>S. Nay's Spotlight Review, entitled Nothing Happy about "Happy Feet", is right on the money. Their list of issues is nearly identical to mine.<br /><br />There's only a couple of things I would add.<br /><br />Why did the Adelie penguins speak with a heavily urban Hispanic accent? Of all that made no sense in this film, that reigned supreme. (You also might wonder why Lovelace has a name like Lovelace when others have names like Ramon. And why, if all they give him is pebbles, is he so fat?)<br /><br />Penguins with heavy English or Scottish accents (the elders of the Emperor penguins) were closed minded idiots.<br /><br />You can't have multiple accents in a film - especially when one accent represents blindness, the other open mindedness - and not be making a comment. Yet I'm perfectly certain that the producers of the film were NOT making any kind of social commentary whatsoever based on the distribution of accents. That's what makes it so puzzling.<br /><br />That and Mumble's name (the other Emperor Penguins had "normal" names), and his blue eyes - again, something that no Emperor Penguin shared - that used to be cute when Elijah Wood was a child actor but are either mesmerizing or freakish, depending on how you look at them.</p></br><a href="../users/A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5.html">A3AVJCB1ZD6ZY5</a><br/><p>I've seen "Happy Feet" twice in the theatre and I will own the movie when it comes out on DVD.  This is a joyous rolick with a lot of action and wonderful effects.  The film is well worth watching for the whole family.</p></br><a href="../users/A11ED8O95W2103.html">A11ED8O95W2103</a><br/><p>South polar-izing in this case, but it's hard to miss the fact that some people really love this movie and some really...well...don't.<br /><br />I just saw this movie twice over the past three days, and here's my take on it, with the upsides and the downsides.<br /><br />The upsides were:<br /><br />The animation technology!  Some of the animation, especially the backgrounds, was drop dead gorgeous.  I don't even have HD, and I was mesmerized by how beautifully done some parts of this movie were.<br /><br />The misfit becomes a hero.  It hit sort of close to home for my wife and I because we have a special needs child and have often felt like Memphis and Norma Jean.  What went wrong?  We sigh a lot and wonder what will become of him.  I quietly hope he will develop some great talent some day.  We'll see.<br /><br />An environmental message that wasn't too heavy handed.  The humans are not presented as evil, just as being who didn't know what they were doing.  Once they discovered the penguins, they helped them out.  At least this movie didn't stoop to the now very tired "man is bad" cliche message.<br /><br />Interesting symbology.  The "Memphis" character was obviously Elvis, and Norma Jean was Marilyn Monroe?  The two icons of the 1950's give birth to a misfit who revolutionalizes music among a sort of authoritarian theocratic paternal oligarchy.  Is this supposed to be something like what happened when rock 'n roll took America by storm in the late 1950's and early 60's?  The fundamentalists preached against rock 'n roll, and the kids just wanted to have fun.<br /><br />The music itself.  I found it varied and rather enjoyable.  I've never liked that "Somebody to Love" song by Queen, but I genuinely enjoyed the way it was rendered by the penguin choir.<br /><br />Finally, extrapolating on the fact that penguin couples can identify each other out of the masses of penguins because each has a unique call.  This I assume was the inspiration for the idea that penguins mate when they find "their song".<br /><br />Now the downsides:<br /><br />I found the adult penguin characters to be designed in a way that didn't make them particularly endearing to look at.  I thought the penguins in Surf's Up (which anyone who likes this movie should see too; it's brilliant) were designed to look more fun and loveable.  The hint of breasts on the female penguins just made them look sort of weird.<br /><br />One dimensional stereotype characters.  There's the overbearing authoritarian fundamentalists, the holy roller preacher, the "five amigo" wise guys, the skua bird gang, etc.  There just wasn't much depth anywhere in the character department.<br /><br />Very little genuine humor.  A lot of what was supposed to be humor seemed forced, Disney Style.  I was entertained throughout the movie, but I only really laughed two or three times.<br /><br />And, one big helping of subliminal vulgarity.  I read it elsewhere and so out of curiosity I freeze framed through the sequence where Gloria and Happy Feet emerge from their first swim and tumble through the snow, and yes it lookes like they went through the catalogue of sexual positions.  That was crass, but then this movie is rated PG for a reason.  I mean, what parent would think that a fuzzy little cute baby penguin on all the artwork would mean that they should allow their young children see it?  Who would get that idea anyway?<br /><br />So, a solid three stars for a movie that pretends to be for the little ones but richly deserves a PG rating and perhaps PG-13.  Now, my happy keys gotta stop clickin'.  Tippity tippity tap tap click!</p></br><a href="../users/A9RNMO9MUSMTJ.html">A9RNMO9MUSMTJ</a><br/><p>First, this movie may be appreciate by kids, but its really made for big<br /><br />kids, which will understand and appreciate it more.  Great music, great<br /><br />characters will entertain you with this eye candy of a movie. I did'nt<br /><br />know what to expect, and viewing it at 23:00 it had to be good. By the<br /><br />time the movie ended, i could'nt go to bed...cause my feet were dancing.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL.html">A3EE0H0NWQ9QVL</a><br/><p>'Happy Feet' is an animated feature that has some dizzying animation effects.  Sitting there in the theatre, I thought at times that I was watching an I-Max feature.  (And at times I was glad I wasn't, which leads me to believe that the cries of one young theatre-goer, indicate it may be too intense for younger viewers.)  For the rest of us over seven, there is a good, although familiar, story of the misfit penguin.  "Mumble" (played with proper insecurity by the voice of the Hobbit, Elijah Wood) does what comes naturally.  Having some latent pre-hatched anomolies, he comes out ready to dance rather than sing.  It alienates him from his community and his love interest, Gloria (played with sexy voice by Brittany Murphy).  His loner pursuit gets him in another fold.  (In this case they're alien penguins with Spanish accents.)  The elders disaprove of the alien assimilation, reasoning that too many mouths to feed will stretch community resources too thin.  (Sound familiar?)  The development is often episodic with harrowing enemies--like a sea lion--and songs that burst out at the drop of an iceburg.  (Just like other musicals, characters burst out in song for the weather--or, in this case Northern Lights, and falling in love--or, again, mating season.)  The bursts of songs are decent to splendid.  (This film is worth every penny for watching the penguins dive into arctic waters from great heights while the full stereo spendour of the Beach Boys' "Do It Again" pipes through the digital sound.)<br /><br />The main plot has a point and a destination.  Mumble meets into Lovelace (Robin Williams) who is the penguin guru.  (Much of the movie makes political points, for he wears an involuntary necklace made from a plastic six-pack ring.)  He is short on advice, but Mumble has the messianic touch to go solo on a trek to discover the aliens (man) and solve the mystery of the disappearing food supply.  "Happy Feet" Mumble tries to bridge that gap and bring home the bacon (or in this case, sardines).  While I either respect or agree with the viewpoints of the film, I sometimes think it would be more effective if they "chilled out" a little bit.  Besides that, 'Happy Feet' is an irresistible animated musical drama/comedy.  (Robin Williams does three voices, including Mumble's main homie, Ramon, which sounds like Williams' comedy portrayal of Ricardo Maltoban.)</p></br><a href="../users/A12X2J7AVZ04IQ.html">A12X2J7AVZ04IQ</a><br/><p>I bought the DVD, sight-unseen, and am not disappointed. I take issue with many of the previous reviewers, in many ways. Peril seems to be an issue, but lessons are learned from those in peril; anyone remember "Pinocchio" or "Peter Pan" or "Bambi"? Also, Robin Williams gave some ethnic impressions (very well, I thought, and entertaining). This was necessary because the "Hispanic" penguins were of another tribe. What's the fuss? My problem was that it started out too slow, too much time setting the scene. Once it got going, I had no problem keeping up. Narrow minded people have forgotten that ethnic characters have been a part of cartoon history, so why complain now (anyone remember Babba-Looie, or the speech impediment of Elmer Fudd?). Lighten up, for God's sake. I liked "Cars", too, only because I hit the old Route 66 and was dismayed. Both are good films.</p></br><a href="../users/A2PNTEDGMOLMOY.html">A2PNTEDGMOLMOY</a><br/><p>George Miller's animated film, "Happy Feet," is a visual wonder and accomplishes the same feat as Baz Luhrman's "Moulin Rouge," by deftly weaving popular songs into the plot of the movie.  But please note, the title and the fact that the movie features beyond-cute penguins belie the fact that this is a more grown-up cartoon that earns its PG rating - this is not G-rated family fare for kiddies of all ages.<br /><br />"HF" focuses on emperor penguins, and Miller pays an obvious tribute to "March of the Penguins" in the opening scenes.  Memphis (Hugh Jackman) falls in love with Norma Jean (Nicole Kidman) and they have an egg.  Norma Jean then heads off for the fishing grounds, leaving Memphis with the egg through the long cold winter night - a scene that the movie creates with dazzling artistry.  Tragedy nearly strikes when Memphis drops his egg for a few seconds - anyone who has seen "March" knows that a few instants can be fatal.  Memphis is gravely worried that his instant of inattention has cost his family dear.<br /><br />But all appears well when Mumble (Elijah Wood) hatches . . . but then he starts tap-dancing.  Memphis tries to help Mumble hide this odd quirk (penguins are a rigid society), but everything comes clear when Mumble proves that he absolutely cannot sing.  This is a big sin in emperor penguin land, as every emperor penguin has a "heart song," and without it, you can never find a mate.  Mumble can't sing, but he can dance like Savion Glover (who provides the dancing).  Still, Gloria (Brittany Murphy), the best-singing penguin Mumble's age, won't have him because he can't sing, and Mumble is ostracized.<br /><br />What follows is a wild ramble for Mumble.  He encounters dangerous leopard seals and meets new friends, some Latino penguins who aren't so hung-up on singing.  Ultimately, Mumble learns that the fishing problems plaguing the penguins (the fish are mysteriously disappearing) are not blamed on the penguins' lack of devotion to their ways, but the depredations of aliens (i.e., man).  So what begins as a musical romp turns into a powerful environmental message-film.<br /><br />And powerful it is.  I first saw "HF" with my four-year old daughter in the Omnimax format, and many adults were shedding tears by the end of the movie.  This is serious stuff, but I have to admit that my daughter was also riveted by the movie despite its near two-hour length.<br /><br />Look for more mature humor - this is more like "Shrek" than "Toy Story."<br /><br />All in all, "HF" is one of the best animated films to come out in recent years, and that's saying something as we are seeing more and more animated movies than ever before.  It's a little dark for some kids, so you should probably watch it with your kids the first time to make sure that it's OK.  But the good news is that you will enjoy Mumble's journey and probably have some explaining to do with your kids about man's siphoning of the penguin's fish.  An excellent film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KEZLJ59C1JVH.html">A3KEZLJ59C1JVH</a><br/><p>I have to say, I was a bit disappointed by "Happy Feet." I was so excited when all the trailers for this film initially came out, but then it took me forever to see the movie, and when I finally did, I thought it didn't live up to the hype.<br /><br />The premise of the story is cute enough. The whole deal with this group of penguins is that they're all talented singers, except for poor Mumble (voiced by Elijah Wood), who can't carry a tune to save his life. Mumble is rejected by his fellow penguins, with the exception of his mother (voiced by Nicole Kidman) and Gloria (voiced by Brittany Murphy), the female penguin who captured Mumble's heart from day one. Even Mumble's dad (voiced by Hugh Jackman) is disappointed in his son. However, what Mumble lacks in vocal talent is made up by his incredible dance moves. Unfortunately, though, none of the other penguins in the colony are impressed by Mumble's "happy feet," so he instantly becomes an outcast.<br /><br />I wish this could be the basic plot of the movie, but it's not. I figured the film was all about how one penguin's special talent was eventually accepted by everyone else and the moral of the story would be that individuality should always be celebrated, blah blah blah. That's part of the story, but not all of it. I expected the whole film to be filled with dancing, singing penguins, but that only makes up about 20% of the movie, if that. The majority of "Happy Feet" stresses an environmental message about pollution and animal well-being, and obviously that's a very important message, but I thought it was major overkill in this case. There were times when I actually felt extremely depressed watching "Happy Feet," and that was so wrong! Also, in my opinion, the movie is way too long, and of course all the depressing parts of the film were dragged out to the extreme.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is an enjoyable film with fun songs and cute dancing penguins. However, the "happy feet" aspect of the film was much smaller than I expected, which is why I was kind of let down by this movie. If there's going to be a "Happy Feet 2," it needs to be at least 75% dancing penguins and 25% depressing environmental issues...and try to make it slightly less depressing! After all, this is supposed to be a fun movie for kids, not an Al Gore documentary. The word "happy" is in the title, for god's sake!</p></br><a href="../users/ACVFTS9X2MKJ8.html">ACVFTS9X2MKJ8</a><br/><p>Musically, this isn't for kids.  That should have been figured out by everyone right away.  Many of the songs (many which are sexually suggestive) are 20 to 40 years old anyway.  The kind of music that we use to listen to when we were kids.  But, to me, I'd rather our kids listen to sexy songs instead of today's angry songs.<br /><br />And one moment in the film Mumbles is being singled out as if something is wrong with him because he's different.  This could have been a discussion similar to telling a child that he's wrong for being gay. Which has got to be the hardest thing for any naturally sexually healthy parent to have to do.<br /><br />But, the entertainment of this musical film changes when it suddenly becomes a message about our endangered environment.  We're taking away all the fish so the penguins are having a harder time to survive.  In my opinion, the best way to reduce the amount of starving penguins in this world is to hunt them too.  I wouldn't mind trying a penguin sandwich, or try penguin soup.  And how would we prepare a meal with a penguin?  Should it be broiled, boiled, or fried?  Or steamed penguin meat with broccoli on rice?  How about breaded and fried, and dipped in Ranch dressing?  I wonder how penguin meat would be on a cracker with cheese. Umm, how about penguin enchiladas?  I'd be happy to try anything on my plate if it would help to balance our ecology.<br /><br />"I'd like to have one McPenguin burger with fries and a coke, please."  Maybe we can give the fish a break and try eating more penguin.  Could that help the environment?</p></br><a href="../users/A3JLOIXFM75QNV.html">A3JLOIXFM75QNV</a><br/><p>If you really get down to the heart and soul of this film, you would know that Happy Feet is not really about a penguin looking for meaning and purpose among all the other penguins. It has a hidden meaning that children will not get. Its very clever and only really comes out of hiding towards the end. In a way, the subtle message regarding the environment is a good thing, but its a shame it has to be disguised in a children's cartoon.<br />The songs are mediocre at best and the penguins come across as likeable, but really, it doesn't have much going for it. Its certainly a watchable movie and does have its fun moments, but really, its almost too adult in certain ways for children to truly appreciate it. But I am sure most kids will like it as is too.</p></br><a href="../users/A2MG8DHACXH5MS.html">A2MG8DHACXH5MS</a><br/><p>This is a cute cartoon of a dancing penguin who follows the beat of his own drum all the way to the land of humans to save his family from starving. When the fish dissappear an oddball penguin who can sing but not dance goes to find out what happened and to appeal to the humans to stop hurting the penguin food chain.</p></br><a href="../users/A387BD735MI50R.html">A387BD735MI50R</a><br/><p>This is an appealing film, likely to engage both older children and adults. It's a sort of re-telling of the "Jonathan Livingston Seagull" parable that was so popular a generation ago. Jonathan learned to soar in mystic solitude while his peers were still limiting themselves to clumped shoreline scavengering. Here Mumbles, a non-conforming penguin, persists in dancing while all his peers are still expressing their heart-songs literally, by singing. Both works are celebrations of doing your own thing, of following your unique passion.<br /><br />But the producers of "Happy Feet" made a few odd choices along the way. First of all, it was odd to have animated penguins doing the dancing. Penguins have such short feet, buried in their paunches, that it's difficult to see and appreciate their foot action. I wonder if perhaps the success of the nature documentary "March of the Penguins" influenced this choice. Since that documentary made penguins a hot ticket, the producers might have decided to ride the crest of penguin popularity and feature them regardless. I'm not sure of the respective chronology of the two pictures though.<br /><br />Then the score here isn't particularly inspired. A lot of the music is determinedly modern, and therefore not necessarily the most melodic or spirited.<br /><br />Finally, I thought for a while there that we were sailing into some serious ethnic stereotyping. When Mumbles is catapulted into another community of penguins, it's obvious these others are being voiced by Robin Williams and others almost as caricatures of Hispanic and African-Americans.<br /><br />First it's Ramon and his barrio buddies who come forward to greet the newcomer and to take him under their wings. Like typical boys from the hood, they spurn honest work and the business of preparing to be legitimate fathers by assembling pebble nests. Instead they are out cruising for "chicas" on their charm and machismo alone.<br /><br />Next Mumbles works his way in among a revivalist congregation led by Lovelace, an obvious parody of a Baptist preacher who is using his pulpit fervors simply as a way of gulling the ladies back into his chambers afterwards. I really wondered why there hadn't been some picketing objections to "Happy Feet," considering this parade of negative racial stereotypes.<br /><br />But then I began to get past taking offense, past political correctness. I even began to like Lovelace. He becomes a more sympathetic character when he's reduced to seeking Mumbles' help tracking the real source of the sacred pendant he's been claiming was bestowed on him by some higher powers. We viewers can see that Lovelace's talisman is pitifully only a plastic pop bottle ring that he's gotten around his neck and that is now choking him to death him as a result of the expansion he's undergone from his congregation's tributes. His plight sends Mumbles and his new band of comrades on an ecological mission that rushes to too much of an abrupt conclusion - as if the scriptwriter suddenly just wanted to go home. This was particularly disappointing since I had begun to enjoy the company of all these home boys so much.<br /><br />So when Ramon, with all his irrepressible stocky cockiness, beckons and commands, "Come over here, Fuzzy. Let me tell dju someting" - I lean down, ready to listen and follow.</p></br><a href="../users/AVOCNUFOXUCA6.html">AVOCNUFOXUCA6</a><br/><p>"Happy Feet" is an amiable little movie, a slight good-natured bit of animation.  And the animation is spectacular, as review after review has attested.  The technical achievements of "Happy Feet" are noteworthy, including the sound.  If you have a subwoofer, it will get a workout during some scenes.<br /><br />But as review after review has also attested, there is no story here.  If you like plot, you will be sadly disappointed.  I turned to my wife at the 30 minute mark into the movie and said that I still didn't know what the story was, and she didn't either.  This movie may be good for very little kids, who will enjoy the animation and singing and dancing and don't have any demands or expectations about plot.  But, older children and adults are likely to be looking at their watches well before the ending wondering when this overly-long film will end.<br /><br />This is at least worth a rent for families with young children.</p></br><a href="../users/A2B7BUH8834Y6M.html">A2B7BUH8834Y6M</a><br/><p>Well, I know the film will be far more popular than this review, but I try to call them as they are. The film starts out with narration, but does not end with narration - which makes you wonder how well thought out the story was and how much went on the cutting room floor - so to speak. Memphis has the golden throat of Elvis and his wife Norma Jean has the buxom penguin chest of Marilyn Monroe, replete with "mole" marking on her shoulder.<br /><br />The couple breaks into song, frequently professing their love for one another. Unlike other 3D animation hits like "Toy Story" and "Shrek," this story does not have original songs written for the story - instead they re-do popular hits... and the lyrics are frankly not appropriate for children. Here are some snippets:<br /><br />Kiss:<br /><br />You don't have to be beautiful,<br /><br />to turn me on.<br /><br />I just need your body, baby,<br /><br />from dusk 'til dawn.<br /><br />You don't need experience,<br /><br />to turn me on.<br /><br />You just leave it all up to me<br /><br />Tell Me Something Good:<br /><br />Problem is you ain't been loved like you should<br /><br />What i got will sure 'nuff do you good<br /><br />It'll do you good<br /><br />Is this what you want your kids singing to all day long? What happened to Chim-Chimery Charoo? What happened to even nonsensical, but at least innocent lyrics for innocent ears? Why are we in such a rush to sex up our kids in this society?<br /><br />The penguins pray to their "Great Gwynne" (I think that's what they were saying - but I don't read beaks well and there was no closed captioning on the big screen) - a diety in the sky that is the likeness of a giant penguin that they summon with their heart song. I was sitting there in the theater with my gaping maw hanging open. "What am I looking at?" I kept asking myself. While all the females have waddled out to the ocean to fish, the men stay back with their eggs tucked warmly between their legs. While everyone else is praying to their penguin diety, Memphis is doing his own mantra, summoning what appears to be an image of his wife, Norma Jean. I don't think parents realize what they're taking their kids to go see, quite frankly - this stuff is just weird.<br /><br />All the penguins look basically the same (except for blue-eyed Mumbles, mole-bespeckled Norma Jean and a theological patriarch that has a hunched neck like a vulture), so their big moment of individuality is their heart song. Mumbles practically dances his way out of his egg, but this society where everyone wears the same tuxedo is intolerant of differences, even with a baby. He is shunned by not only classmates, but by adults as well. Even Mumbles' father is unsettled by his son's talent and lack of singing ability.<br /><br />In almost sociopathic fashion, Mumbles entertains himself when he's alone - dancing to a song that is apparently in his head. While charming, it's also kinda weird. Children have an innate desire to belong - yet he'd rather be alone with his own music - and is content to be this way as he dances with fervor.<br /><br />There is some violence as gulls attempt to eat Mumbles alive and he is then persued, bitten and permanently maimed by one of the most vicious renderings of a seal I have ever seen. The folks that club baby seals to death will want this vicious-looking seal as their poster child to advocate further clubbing. The noises this critter makes are akin to the T-Rex in "Jurassic Park."<br /><br />As Mumbles escapes death, he encounters another breed of penguis - that all speak Spanish. Kids are just going to be confused - this is Antartica, but everyone here is multilingual. The accents are adorable, but the Spanish flavor is simply not explained... it's not like he travelled to another continent. Another violent scene in which killer whales attempt to eat a group of penguins and nearly drown then choke a penguin to death are painfully uncomfortable to watch - the violence is over the top.<br /><br />Too many movies aimed at children include violence against beloved characters to get emotional involvement, then pepper the movie with cute animals, songs and merriment - so the child is very involved emotionally, but doesn't even realize why. The violence is just too much for the little kids that are going to want to see this movie the most.<br /><br />Mumbles appears to also be a late-bloomer. He's not only a dancer, not a singer - but he is the only penguin that has a child-like lack of development into adolescence. When the other animals have clearly gone through a normal development cycle with the seasons, Mumbles retains his downy coat way beyond a normal period - yet goes swimming. If a real penguin that still had the down on it were to get into the icy Antarctic waters, it would quickly freeze to death or drown. He's also got blue eyes which no one seems to notice or comment on - but he's clearly the only blue-eyed penguin on the entire continent.  Mumbles almost has this Michael Jackson-esque quality about him. He's child-like, optimistic, hangs out with much shorter male penguins, and is a great choreographer. Hmm.<br /><br />A-la Rudolph, this misfit ends up being the salvation of the penguins. They are all quickly singing the penguin's praises after shunning him since he was practically an egg... and join him in a string of dance moves that is reminiscent of Michael Jackson's "Thriller" video.<br /><br />Penguins are adorable, so kids are going to flock to this movie in droves - but it's not all about being cute and fuzzy. The movie is violent and over-sexed for kids. Not only would I not take my own kids to see this video, this is one I don't care to see again. I love kids' films and am partial to the well-done 3D animation, but without a good story line, the best animation in the world does not a good movie make.<br /><br />This film had lots of good potential, but it was not edited properly. Narration opens the film, but then is not heard from again. The songs are not original, but 'sexy' songs redone for a kids' film. As an adult, I enjoyed the film and laughed in spots, but was not won over. It lacks the innocence it purports to embrace.</p></br><a href="../users/A1AISPOIIHTHXX.html">A1AISPOIIHTHXX</a><br/><p>Awhile ago, I watched the Polar Express, the all-CG Christmas film by Robert Zemeckis of Back to the Future and Forrest Gump fame. It was a stunning film to look at (except those doll eyes) but the story basically trodded along and I called the film "bi-polar" since it did as much things wrong as it did right. Happy Feet is the exact same way. The animation is consistently stunning but then it's got other elements that prevents it from being a good animation film. It has its fans but some people, like me, won't know what they just saw.<br /><br />In the land of Antarctica, penguins find their mates through "heartsongs" where penguins sing and should someone connect with it, then they become mates. Due to an accident, young Mumble can't sing to save his life but he can tap dance like no one's business. But in penguin land, tap dancing is just not cool and he desperatedly tries to win the affections of penguin Gloria while also solving the problem of the shortage of fish with the help of a young spanish-accented posse.<br /><br />How to describe Happy Feet...it's hard. For one third, it's basically Moulin Rouge! with penguins. It's unbelievably strange to hear penguins sing "Somebody to Love" by Queen but like in Moulin Rouge!, it at least fit the tone and feel. Then it becomes essentially like Dreamworks' films with a bunch of pop-culture references and lowbrow humor, courtesy of Robin Williams heading the spanish posse. Then we get an environmental message and the weirdest last act I've ever seen in an animated movie. How this won over Cars and Monster House is completely beyond me. Cars is considered Pixar's weakest output while Monster House was a bit more intense for the younger viewers so Happy Feet probably got a default win.<br /><br />However, I can't fault the film on the animation. In the special features of Finding Nemo, they asked the animators to get realistic with the water to the point where it looked indisguishable from reality so they had to dial it back and made it more animation friendly. Happy Feet though didn't listen and some shots, such as vista scenes and landscapes look straight out of documentaries; they're just that sharp. Then we have the oh-so-adorable penguin babies and a couple great action scenes with the highlight being Mumble outrunning a sea lion. And I don't want to spoil one other use of filmmaking they used at the end but it's definately a "what the?" moment.<br /><br />Some people are developing a DVD sixth sense: anticipating a double-dip. The extras here are unbelievably light to the point where you just know looking at the back that there's a future 2-disc on its way. Of course the kiddies won't mind but for others who like to get some insight into the film, this is quite disappointing; especially when it's been over a month since the film won the Oscar.<br /><br />The film's got stellar animation but a very schizophrenic story and there's a couple of moments that made me laugh unintentionally (basically the last 10-15 minutes or so) so kids will probably like it while others feel disappointed. That's where I am.</p></br><a href="../users/ADJBUPS8SJHTC.html">ADJBUPS8SJHTC</a><br/><p>I really like this movie for the simple fact of what it was trying to convey; Somehow, the penguins could sing, but poor Mumble, couldn't. I like it when his mother kept on being there for him no matter what. But what I like is the fact that they had this whole darn chior, but this ONE little fella couldn't sing to save his life if he could. Very interesting movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A1CDZNPO7U4E6N.html">A1CDZNPO7U4E6N</a><br/><p>This movie will go down as one of my favorite movies of all time. Anybody who knows me can honestly say that I don't smile easily. I think it's because I have little or no sense of humor, and things that most people find funny, I don't find amusing at all. When I saw this movie, I was pleasantly surprised because I was on the floor laughing. I think this movie is so visually beautiful at times I couldn't help but smile. There are few cartoons that I like, watch, or even give the time of day, but I just felt drawn to this movie. I'm glad to say it wasn't a total waste of time. I think people of all ages will love this despite the fact that it is a child's movie because the music is awesome and done with taste instead of being raunchy and disrespectful. I have watched this movie so many times that I love to sing-a-long. I recommend buying this movie definitely. I think the kids will really enjoy this one.</p></br><a href="../users/AUTBHG6070SL4.html">AUTBHG6070SL4</a><br/><p>This movie is another big step forward in computer animation. Action is livelier, textures are more lifelike, and even industrial geometries come to life forbiddingly. Fer cryin' out loud, they got fat dumpy penguins dancing like hot human babes - who'd have guessed? I'm jaded, though. I've come to expect artistic and expressive breakthroughs in computer animation. If they upend the whole game board on schedule, when they're supposed to, I can only be politely impressed.<br /><br />But I'm really impressed. They got everything right - even the people. If those were real people, esp. that little girl, then accept my apology, because I thought they were animations (except that bunch at the end). They got the mood right, family tensions (OK, not deep, but way over the bar for a kid's movie), determination, and making friends with folks who look different. They also offer some really cool water ballet, the kind you'd learn from the Blue Angels. This may be just a little intense at times, if you have small and skittish kids, but that's just because a world of carnivores has intense moments in it, like it or not. The mommy/daddy thing is tasteful, loving, and biologically vague.<br /><br />It's not just for kids, though. It has the kind of wit, the kind of musical and cultural literacy that keeps the grownups engaged, too. (You bought the tickets, you deserve at least as much as your young'uns.) Robin Williams bounces suitably off the wall, though not so much as in Robots. Everyone puts in good voices, which is kind of unfortunate. The real star power here came from the anonymous geeks who programmed the physics for penguin bone and blubber, then put a human spirit into it. Maybe it's a compliment that the great voice actors sank so silently behind their characters - I'm more impressed by the mathematical feat of computing how fuzz on baby penguins catches the light, then forcing me and everyone else into an "Awww, cute!" response by means of that arithmetic mastery.<br /><br />I could pick a few nits, like the very odd schedule on which Mumble sheds his juvenile coat so long after his peers, but only a few. And, if I did, it just wouldn't be any fun. This movie is fun, not to make fun of. It's also a pretty fair 100-minute treat for fans of a capella music. It's not my style, but it finally made me understand why people buy movie soundtracks.<br /><br />//wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release</p></br><a href="../users/A2HVL790PBWYTU.html">A2HVL790PBWYTU</a><br/><p>Awwwww, so cute! Man, the baby penguins were so freakin' adorable, especially the blue-eyed Mumble! I had such a good time with this film! HAPPY FEET is breathtaking and, like the best of animated films, successfully marries a sense of fun, cuteness, and charm, guaranteed to enchant the young, with a more sophisticated, darker layer which will satisfy the young-at-heart and maybe even make them reflect a bit. HAPPY FEET is an effective fusion of music, humor, and poignancy. It's part coming-of-age story, part heroic quest, and part commentary on staid, rigidly structured societies. And it is all musical. Most will be familiar with the finger-snapping, head-bobbing tunes, including the classic chorus from "The Message." Robin Williams ("My Way"), Brittany Murphy ("Somebody to Love" & "Boogie Wonderland"), Nicole Kidman ("Kiss"), and Hugh Jackman ("Heartbreak Hotel") offer up their own song renditions. Whether they do their musical numbers justice is wholly up to the viewer's discretion. Meanwhile, Mumble's tap dancing is gloriously brought to life on screen, thanks to the motion-capture work done by heralded tap dancer Savion Glover.<br /><br />Be cautioned that this film isn't quite in the same happy-go-lucky vein as the recent CARS, OVER THE HEDGE, THE WILD, and FLUSHED AWAY. Yes, the humor is there, as well as the familiar family-oriented sensibilities, but Director George Miller injects HAPPY FEET with more depth than normally found in animation (THE INCREDIBLES aside). This film has pretty dark sequences and several legitimate "boo!" moments, as the key characters are occasionally placed in harrowing danger, which might elicit a frightened gasp or an "Oh, no!" from the young 'uns. The vast, open, icy expanses of Antarctica lend an aura of grandeur and make the fairly solemn core storyline more credible. Now I'm not really a fan of message films - and HAPPY FEET's key plotline does hinge heavily on the penguins' environmental woes as caused by humans - but this film manages to weave its points seamlessly enough into the story, as opposed to heavy-handedly hammering it home.<br /><br />The plot: Maybe it's because he was dropped while still in his egg, but  Mumble (Elijah Wood), from the moment he hatched, has displayed a penchant for displaying happy feet, in the form of tap, an activity fiercely frowned upon by the penguin hierarchy as being quite undignified. To make it worse for Mumble, he can't sing a proper note, which is a severe dilemma. For without a heartsong, how will he find his  true love? From the get-go, Mumble becomes an outcast, an Emperor penguin forever toe-tapping on the fringes and treated with scorn by his peers. Even his father Memphis (Hugh Jackman) is embarassed of him and strives to make over Mumble into a more stately-shambling citizen. But there's a graver concern in the offing, which affects the entire penguin population: fish is getting harder to find. When the aged community patriarch Noah (Hugo Weaving) blames the scarcity of food on Mumble's unconventional tapping, which supposedly has angered the penguin deity, Mumble vows to seek the reason for the fish's disappearance and begins his odyssey. Initially accompanied by five wise-cracking, fun-loving Adelie penguins (with Mexican accents) who call themselves the Amigos and who think Mumble is accidentally cool, Mumble ultimately finds himself alone as he confronts the source of his community's fish depletion - us.<br /><br />The voice cast is perfectly good and doesn't get in the way of the pretty pictures. The ever-lively Robin Williams, who plays three characters here (Lovelace, Cletus, and the scene-stealing Ramon), is actually back to being funny. And, with CG animation that is drop-dead AMAZING and is guaranteed to make your jaw drop, HAPPY FEET is hands down the best animated film I've seen in years.</p></br><a href="../users/A1A535W556ROBQ.html">A1A535W556ROBQ</a><br/><p>Not content to rely solely on the unusual mating habits of emperor pengins for his story, Miller turns this pengiun caper into a crusade against Antarctic fishing, as a community of penguins finds itself with a vastly depleted ocean, having to fight with nasty antarctic birds, leopard seals and other denizens of the deep for the slim pickings.  The weight of the world falls on the shoulders of Mumble, the "ugly duckling" of the brood, who has his rhythm in his feet rather than his voice.  The movie is chock full of soulful tunes as the emperor penguins compete for each other's affection through "love songs."  It also provides a convenient way to differentiate between the huge flightless commnunity.<br /><br />Mumble finds himself left out of the mating game, forced to journey across the vast expanse of Antarctic in search of the mysterious reasons for the depleted stock of fish.  He joins up with penguins of another breed, including one named "Lovelace," who mistakes a six-pack ring for a mantel of the gods, until it becomes a little too tight around the collar.  There are some tense moments, but my little girl didn't panic.  It was just a little bit too long for her to hold her coca-cola.  Eventually the great mystery is revealed and Mumble has the homecoming one would expect, with everyone dancing to his "Happy Feet."  It is easy to see why the movie became a big audience favorite over the holiday season, as it maintains a playful momentum throughout the story, and in the end the precious balance is restored.</p></br><a href="../users/ANCOMAI0I7LVG.html">ANCOMAI0I7LVG</a><br/><p>I'm not one who usually gets excited about cartoons.  I mean, lately with the birth of my daughter around the corner I've been watching quite a bit more of them, but in general they are not my thing.  `Happy Feet' though was one I was determined to see.  You see, I adore the little creatures known as penguins and a cartoon devoted to them just seemed to be almost heaven sent.  I rushed to watch it, given all the praise and rave reviews, and have to say that after watching it through I was thoroughly disappointed.  Yes, I said disappointed.  In actuality I'm floored that it received all the rave reviews, and while I'll stand by the fact that it is indeed a better cartoon than that tripe known as `Cars' I still can't believe this mess won the Oscar.<br /><br />The storyline is a bit of a bore.  The whole `heartsong' aspect of this film kind of left me with this overly cheesy `I can believe I'm watching this' kind of feeling.  You see penguins love to sing.  That's how they find their soul mates.  They find their `heartsong' and thus find their mate.  The problem with little Mumble is that he can't sing.  He's practically tone-deaf and this has made him the outcast.  But he's not without his talent.  He can dance, but no one else seems to care much for that.  In fact the other penguins resent him for his talent and ultimately blame him for their lack of food.  So he's banished from the colony.  His banishment was the best thing for him though for he meets up with some Spanish penguins who embrace his ability to dance and help him change the world in effect bringing back all the fish.<br /><br />If I said anymore I'd give away too much so I'll stop there.<br /><br />So, while the plot is a bit on the `meh' side, there is more to hate in regards to this film.  First off the singing is ridiculous.  Instead of all new original songs (whatever happened to the good ol' days when animators and storyboard creators actually invested some originality in their work) we have a bunch of penguins running around singing songs we hear on the radio with lyrics changed slightly.  What makes it worse is that some of the songs are heavy on the sexual innuendos and are really inappropriate for children.  The voice over work is decent, but is it just me or is Nicole Kidman a little too breathy and somewhat annoying?  Personally, I don't feel she fit very well.<br /><br />In fact, the only really `good' thing about this movie was the incredibly talented Robin Williams who is just brilliant in this kind of work.  I've said this before, but I'll say it again.  I think it should be mandatory that every cartoon have at least one character voiced by Robin Williams.  The great thing about `Happy Feet' is that they give him TWO characters, and both of them are equally hilarious and memorable.  In fact I'm really upset that the remainder of the film is such a dud because both of Williams' characters are two of the funniest cartoon characters in recent memory.  I wish they would have given his characters a different movie to inhabit.  Alas, maybe they'll give him his own spin off.<br /><br />So anyways, I don't really think I have much more to say.  The film ends up getting way too political for its own good, and the ending is such a waste it's almost hard to watch.  I really wanted to like this, I really did, and I expected to love it, but I can't lie to myself.  `Happy Feet' truly is a bore of a film, a missed opportunity, which saddens me for it could have been so much better.</p></br><a href="../users/A10C5CJK1YKGV0.html">A10C5CJK1YKGV0</a><br/><p>The good:<br /><br />I really liked the overall story of the plight of the penguin. The outcast going on the odyssey and then returning home with a hero's welcome.<br /><br />Children **really** love this movie.<br /><br />The music was well done and many very nice, but not too overplayed hits were threaded delicately into the soundtrack. I would've loved to have heard more than just a few bars of K.D. Lang's version of 'Golden Slumbers', but I guess that's what the soundtrack is for.<br /><br />I thought Robin Williams did good work as Ramon here. I will revisit his contribution in the next section as well.<br /><br />This movie had a very subtle message of conservation that wasn't preachy or contrived.<br /><br />It was funny to listen to the King of Steampunk voice the King of Rock n' Roll. I think his penguin Elvis definitely breaks new ground with with old ideas about the King's voice.<br /><br />Steve Irwin would've loved this movie.<br /><br />The bad:<br /><br />I felt the scene that's added in the extras titled: 'Mumble meets a Blue Whale' should've been added into the film for all the reasons that the introduction to the clip stated. I found it odd that Robin Williams could have multiple parts in a film but it was a bit much to have the seagull version of Steve Irwin doing a parody of himself which was very touching. The scene with the elephant seals was dull and difficult to pick out the dialogue. Steve Irwin should've been given his moment in this as this may have bee the last major motion picture that he was attached to.<br /><br />Robin Williams having two very large parts within the film was not just disconcerting but off-putting. While I did like the character of Ramon, I couldn't get around the thought that Williams was probably taking bread off the table of another actor. Cedric the Entertainer comes to mind as well as Bernie Mac. I think Bernie would've been fantastic in the role of Lovelace and it even seems written for him.<br /><br />Also, while we're meant to rightly assume that the narrator is Lovelace, the narration is almost a role in itself as you're left guessing which character it is because he has multiple speaking parts. So chalking up three jobs seems very much over the top.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />I really enjoyed the film and think most others will as well. The points I make are minor ones that the bulk of children wouldn't even give two shakes about. My thoughts about Robin Williams role in this has been repeated quite a bit in many of the other reviews. It looks very good in HD / Blu-Ray as well.<br /><br />... ...</p></br><a href="../users/A3P1508PZ0UADD.html">A3P1508PZ0UADD</a><br/><p>Very entertaining movie.  Come on people, it's just an animated movie, stop reading all kinds of political agenda into it.  Watch it for the entertainment value alone.</p></br><a href="../users/A1DK5AZMXS1QA3.html">A1DK5AZMXS1QA3</a><br/><p>The story of this movie is simple; an Emperor penguin, Mumble, is born in Antarctica.  He cannot sing but he can dance.  This inability to sing and his flaunting of his dancing gets him outcast from his land.  Mumble falls in with a different group of penguins, who just happened to talk like Speedy Gonazeles, and who appreciate his dancing.  Mumble and five friends venture of to find aliens (human beings) and Mumble eventually ends up in a zoo in the US.  He returns to Antarctica with humans who discover how their commercial fishing is hurting the penguins, and hence stop.<br /><br />The movie features many big Hollywood names such as Elijah Wood as Mumble, Nicole Kidman as his mom, Brittany Murphy as Mumble's girlfriend, Hugo Weaving as the elder penguin, and Robin Williams.  The latter voices two roles, one Mexican and one messianic, and it is his performance that provides much of the comedy in this movie.  In a sense, this movie can be seen as Robin Williams' return to his normal roles.  Throughout the 80's and most of the 90's, Mr. Williams made his name in  zany comedies such as Popeye, Mrs. Doubtfire, Hook, Aladdin, and Patch Adams.  Thrown in the mix were funny dramas such as Good Morning Vietnam and the Dead Poet's Society.  Then in the late 1990's and early part of the 21st century, he hit rock bottom with fans and critiques alike with pure non-comedies like Insomnia, One Hour Photo, Jakob the Liar, Bicentennial Man and The Final Cut.  But in the end of 2006, he returned back to form with two comedies; Night at the Museum and Happy Feet.  Both movies feature Robin Williams in his traditional wacky, zany, combination of idiotic faces, sarcasm, slapstick action and bombastic dialogue.  Though Night at the Museum did better, this movie truly features Robin Williams at his best; two roles, sometimes involved in the same dialogue.<br /><br />Along with the comedy of Robin Williams, this movie features a lot of music from hip-hop, rock and roll, R&B, and even some country.  And the special effects are top notch.  all in all, a geat movie.</p></br><a href="../users/A345WVAVMMO6F0.html">A345WVAVMMO6F0</a><br/><p>i liked this but not as much as i had hoped to.  in that its not unlike "march of the penguins".  i think penguins are cute and fun, but they dont seem to have the acting range of other animals, like bunny rabbits.  still, this is fun -- esprcially if you overlook some of the more blatant political posturing.  and its beautiful animation.  just wish there had been a little more "wallace & gromit"-type sensibility.</p></br><a href="../users/A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ.html">A3EOVXI1VZIHUQ</a><br/><p>Remember when we only got a few animated films every couple years? That's back when the producers of an animated film would take their time in developing a story, characters, and well-presented theme. Now, you just throw together as many "name" actors as you can, hire a group of animators and force out a story.<br /><br />And from this new animation environment comes such dreadfully dull and pointless cartoons as Happy Feet. The first 30 minutes looks like an animated remake of March of the Penguins. While the imagery is beautiful, it looked better in real life. A bunch of 80s pop songs are thrown together to tie in the idea that every penguin has a "heartsong". Unfortunately, the covers of these songs are lackluster and really should have been replaced with original material.<br /><br />So, a new penguin is hatched after being dropped by has father onto the cold ice, which we all learned from March of the Penguins, means instant death for the egg. So, this baby doesn't die, he just can't sing and wants to dance all the time. For this he is banished from the land of the penguins, because it's just "un-penguinlike" to dance around.<br /><br />Around the 45 minute mark is where Robin Williams comes in and actually adds life to the slowly sinking ship that is Happy Feet. But one man can only do so much, even if he is voicing multiple characters.<br /><br />Some kind of grand theme clearly depicting the lead penguin as a kind of restrictive religious leader results. Mumbles, the dancing penguin I mentioned earlier who's the main character embarks on a journey to find the "aliens" who are "stealing their fish". By this he means human fishermen of course.<br /><br />The last five to ten minutes becomes almost nonsensical, even for environmentalists who agree with the message that is being pushed onto viewers.<br /><br />Overall, this movie is not worth viewing at all. It's worth avoiding. The voice talent, apart from Robin Williams, is dismal. Nicole Kidman, Brittany Murphy... hearing their voices come out of penguins is not interesting or creative. The music is incredibly poorly done. When one of the main themes of the movie is music and "heartsongs", you could at least expect some decent musical numbers or original tunes. Not here. The story is borderline senseless, and the environmentalist theme is slammed down much to forcefully and ineffectively.<br /><br />But you know what? The animation is actually awesome. I can see why it got released in IMAX theatres because there are some incredible visual effects. They're just too far apart to save the film. And the visual stimulation doesn't keep 95 minutes of boring plot from being boring.</p></br><a href="../users/A2K3L0DOPQQ697.html">A2K3L0DOPQQ697</a><br/><p>I saw this last weekend at a special screening and was suitably impressed. Although I'm a big fan of George Miller's films, I was very hesitant to see this one. The trailers looked awful and indicated nothing about the story. Until the screening came up, I had no intention of seeing this on the big screen. After the opening musical number, the movie quickly won me over. The way it's made is incredibly cinematic, and, at its heart, tells a great mythic story: an outcast leaves his community and journeys to the edge of the world to find a way to end the famine that's plaguing his species. Along this quest, our hero, Mumble, learns to live with his outsider status (he can't sing) and makes use of his own particular gift (tap dancing). It's a simple story that's told in a very creative way with a lot of heart.<br /><br />The musical numbers, instead of having a disrupting effect and stopping the flow of the story, actually advance the plot because they're integral to the story and this particular type of penguin. Emperor Penguins apparently find their mates by singing. While it all sounds the same to us, they are highly attuned to each others songs. The film cleverly translates that idea to the screen by having these animated penguins sing iconic pop/rock songs.<br /><br />I thought the animation was top notch and the style perfectly suited for the story. This isn't the goofy cartoonish animation seen in this past year's other animal-oriented films. It's very rich and leaning heavily towards realism. The vast icy landscapes seem to be copied straight from documentary footage. Just jaw-droppingly beautiful.<br /><br />There's one shot in the film which really epitomizes how well made it is and made me love it that much more. Mumble, his four friends, and the old wise mentor (Lovelace) are heading to the edge of the world as they know it. They're caught in a snow blizzard. The six penguins are shown in almost a dark silhouette as they struggle to move forward. The fading red light of the sun provides faint illumination. As the penguins are pushed back by the blizzard, they lean into the wind and keep going. It's almost like something out of a Kurosawa movie. And that's all it is. Just one shot of the blizzard. But it's beautifully done. Never seen anything like it in an animated film.<br /><br />By the end of the film, my initial reservations about the film were completely washed away. Disregard the lame trailers and see it for yourself.</p></br><a href="../users/A3E975KR2HRERX.html">A3E975KR2HRERX</a><br/><p>But the goofy "Everyone hug a tree for Mother Gaia" ending spoils this silly trip.</p></br><a href="../users/A3KB1H0S7T6JX1.html">A3KB1H0S7T6JX1</a><br/><p>A WONDERFUL animated film, Happy Feet, brings to the screen the story of a young penguin with a terrible singing voice, but a wonderful talent for dancing.  In the Antarctic Emperor Penguin community, however, his dancing abilities are rather unappreciated.  His initial disappointment will soon turn to excitement when events make him discover a world he had no idea existed and his skills are put to good use...<br />Elijah Wood, Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman, Robin Williams, and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the animation does come ALIVE)! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few laughs not to mention a few tears.<br />The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the MUSIC are all EXCELLENT!<br />In short, Happy Feet is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  Strongly recommended along with the Shrek and Ice Age movies, Antz, The Ant Bully, Cars, Flushed Away, Hoodwinked, Madagascar, Monsters Inc. and Over the Hedge.  4.5 Stars<br />PS If you are going to be using the Greek subtitles, simply...do not!  The translation is horrid with profanity that only an amateur (and with serious mental disabilities at that) would think of including in a primarily children's film.</p></br><a href="../users/A3C6CZC2JP67VK.html">A3C6CZC2JP67VK</a><br/><p>The first half of the movie is well done. The characters are well developed and the imagery is extraordinary. My only problem with this part of the movie is that there are too many songs crammed into it. You know that Mumble is going to be different, and when he does arrive on the Earth, the film does a grand job in making the other penguins exclude him for his lack of singing skill, and we quickly feel sorry for the young Mumble, who is thrust into a nasty world straight from birth. The start of the film is very touching, but lacks on the comedy and general interest, and therefore, the film could not have continued in that way forever. And it quickly changed - with the film being best having Mumble as a teenager. He then realizes that people are sick of his uniqueness now and that he is making the others feel humiliated, and that he could well be on his way to an early death.<br /><br />The film started to have more comedy from this point on - thank God for the Latino penguins. If it wasn't for them, the film could hardly even be called a comedy. Though it is meant to be touching, some of the action is extremely high-octane - when the penguins slide down cliffs into the sea, it makes for an overwhelming experience on the silver screen, and it may even thrill you. Though this film tries to be a masterpiece with its important message and generally effective characters and script, it is the animation that makes it brilliant - it is easily one of the best I have seen this year. It is all beautiful, and it truly raises the bar for animation in the future. The film is full of star-studded voice talents, from the youthful Elijah Wood to the irresistibly comedic Robin Williams, who entertains the audience with a feast of accidents and sessions of improvisation.<br /><br />Happy Feet isn't exactly a monumental film and probably won't have any effect on the environmental problems we suffer now, but the animation and story is good. Children will enjoy the clever animation and fun music. The story is a bit too detailed for younger children but the older members of the family will follow it. The movie is longer than what most children will sit through but the love story is endearing and the adventure is thrilling. If you liked March of the Penguin's, you'll love this movie. Even if you didn't like March of the Penguin's, Happy Feet still offers plenty to enjoy.</p></br><a href="../users/A9TG2NFA614S9.html">A9TG2NFA614S9</a><br/><p>"Happy Feet" is a feel good animated movie musical about an Emperor penguin who can't sing at all unlike the rest of his colony. He's an outcast who is a terrific tap dancer. Having seen Savion Glover perform his tap dancing feats on the stage, I knew he was the one whose idiosyncratic dancing style was used as the model for Mumble, the dancing penguin.<br /> People should see this movie in tandem with "March of the Penguins," the documentary about real penguins, so they can see how carefully the makers of this movie were in portraying accurately the behavioral traits of penguins. Real people appear in later scenes of the movie because human beings are endangering the penguin population by overfishing in the Antarctica and elsewhere. Mumble, of course, has to stop them from this anti-penguin activity.<br /> Mumble is the proverbial outsider, the loner who can't do what his brethren can do. After being ostracized from his own colony he joins five Adelie penguins and one Rockhopper penguin who happens to have the voice of Robin Williams. The swimming sequences and the run-in's with predators add excitement to the film. Thousands of computerized, animated penguins are shown in singing or dance segments. Few viewers are going to be bored by this film that won an Academy Award in 2007 for best animated feature. It's entertaining, fun, not overly long, and a hoot.</p></br><a href="../users/AYBL30P5NXNZ4.html">AYBL30P5NXNZ4</a><br/><p>I guess Children's movies should come with some sort of moral or message.. but does it have to be so heavy handed as it is here..?<br /><br />This is a beautifully rendered and infectiously entertaining movie about an individual finding and recognising their own form of expression -a wonderful moral tale in itself.  The voice cast and animators all do full justice, and the accuracy of the penguins in terms of drawing and animal habits is astonishing.<br /><br />However, on top of this the director (George Miller- Babe, Mad Max) has shoe-horned in a message about mans environmental impact in overfishing.  It too is a good message, but feels oddly forced here.  The final q5 minutes of the movie feel almost from a different story.<br /><br />Rest assured, this is still a thumbs up event, greatly entertaining and with a great soundtrack of well known songs.  What a great idea, using well known songs instead of writing them all for the movie, rather like Moulin Rouge did.<br /><br />Recommended - but I still wish they had not forced one message too many down our throats.</p></br><a href="../users/AZ78HT7H9DVJG.html">AZ78HT7H9DVJG</a><br/><p>I was surprisingly disappointed with *Happy Feet*.  Previous animated films had just kept getting better and better but *Happy Feet* was totally opposite.<br /><br />First of all, Mumble, the star of this film, is just cute, cute, cute!  He's a tap dancer which something that his fellow emperor penguins are not happy about because they're supposed to have a graceful heartsong.  Alas, Mumble cannot sing but he sure can dance.<br /><br />And then, that was just about it!  The rest of the story didn't make sense.  First of all, too many songs!  Seriously, *The Sound of Music*, which I'm not quite fond of, is something I'd rather watch than to go through this again.  At least, TSOM didn't overkill with songs.<br /><br />Then, I get the subtle message about the environment and fishing but it was not effective here.  However, the part where Mumble summons up the courage to go after the ship from diving off a high mountain but somehow ended up in captivity just didn't make sense.  Worse, it continued to be  senseless til the end of the movie.<br /><br />Despite its lousy plot, the animation was good.  In fact, too good that it might be a little too scary for young kids.  The leopard seal and orcas are menacing that they'll give your kids nightmares.<br /><br />However, I'd still wouldn't watch this movie again.</p></br><a href="../users/A1D2ZN57YG2NMH.html">A1D2ZN57YG2NMH</a><br/><p>Ok, Happy Feet is weird. It is nothing like the other computer animated films that have been coming out, and is mostly a musical involving penguins and 80's music. Another interesting thing about this film is it's strong message on enviroment, extinction and other things like that, (maybe a bit odd for a childrens movie?) Overal though, this is some of the better family entertainment to come out, and that is why I give it four stars.</p></br><a href="../users/A1FMJJKSVQDDQ.html">A1FMJJKSVQDDQ</a><br/><p>So now we're having a deeper fascination with penguins. They're adorable, but this supposed trend is getting overrated. We've got animated films that contain talking penguins (no surprise there). We've got Surf's Up, Madagascar 1 & 2, and now this. Here we have Happy Feet, which is obviously a CGI family film. But what's wrong with it? Well, I can think of a few. First, it's very anti-religious. I'm an agnostic, and I found the overall message to the second half of the movie very insulting. It's like one of those worthless hypocritical messages that you see on The Church Channel; this is just as bad. Second, the songs are very out of place. Many of the songs contain sexual innuendo. I don't care what kids do (they can do whatever they want), but don't you think that this is a bit too much? And lastly, these penguins are so ANNOYING! Everything about them, from their voices to their dancing, is always on the top level of annoyance. But hey, this is still a family feature, and we all love dancing penguins, don't we?<br /><br />But there is still a plus side for Happy Feet. The animation is really impressive: Antarctica really looks beautiful here. But that's the only good thing about this family film. If you have kids, then watch it with them. You'll have a good time. Otherwise, try to avoid its anti-religious message, and its seemingly nonstop cuteness.</p></br><a href="../users/A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK.html">A2AOZQ3WTNVVOK</a><br/><p>Life in the Antarctic is tough.  The weather is usually too chilly for golf.  It is tough to build a fire because there are no trees and thus no wood.  There are no fast food restaurants for a long way.  Then there are the leopard seals.<br /><br />Mumble (voiced by Elijah "Frodo Baggins" Wood) is hatched to Norma Jean (voice of Nicole Kidman) and Memphis (voice of Hugh Jackman) during a period when female penguins are off fishing.  Life might have been different if Memphis, in a rash moment, had not dropped his egg.<br /><br />As it turns out, penguins are quite musical, at least in this movie they are.  Unfortunately, Mumble is unable to sing.  However, Mumble can dance like Fred Astaire and Bill Robinson and anyone else you can name all put together.  Of course, few penguins are enthused about changing the status quo.  Singing is a good thing, and dancing is strictly forbidden.  After having a rough childhood and having a crush on Gloria (voiced by Brittany Murphy), Mumble is off on his own.<br /><br />Other penguins have other standards and Mumble's ability to dance is an instant hit with the penguins on the other side of the glacier.  Mumble only makes one mistake, and that is to, once again, challenge the status quo when he points out that Barry White impersonator Lovelace (Robin Williams) is a fraud.<br /><br />Poor Mumble is an outcast from just about everywhere, so he decides it is time to track down the aliens that have been chasing away all the fish.  The aliens find Mumble and put him into a strange place where there is a lot of food and a very bizarre environment.  Mumble manages to run into a couple of walls before he realizes that he is not in the Antarctic any more.  Lucky for Mumble the aliens appreciate a good dancer, even if he is dressed in a penguin suit, and the aliens permit Mumble to return to Antarctica, with an electronic decoration.<br /><br />The leaders of the penguins greet Mumble's return with disdain until the aliens show up, and suddenly penguins are line dancing all over the place with abandon.<br /><br />This movie is alternately cute and absurd.  This movie contains a number of positive messages about being different and acceptance.  Much of the movie is accurate regarding the behavior of penguins as they care for their eggs and how they deal with the long Antarctic night.  Much of the movie is funny and is just like the cartoon I expected.  On the flip side, penguins are not intelligent aliens and communicating with dance moves instead of tones (thinking of "Close Encounters of the Third Kind") was just a bit bizarre.  I think the environmental message of this film would have been just as effective with cutesy cartoonish penguins as opposed to tap dancing line dancing penguins.<br /><br />I do not recommend this movie for young children for several reasons.  First is the scene with the skuas.  These predatory birds do attack and eat baby penguins in a gory way.  Second, leopard seals eat just about anything they can catch, including penguins.  Antarctic researchers also avoid leopard seals.  Third, how do you explain why Mumble was eating a bloody chunk of fish (that's not Nemo, it is just sushi, children)?  I can see younger children having nightmares after this movie.  I have yet to mention the numerous adult references, but added together, you can see that this animated film is not for young children.<br /><br />I was surprised to learn that this movie is controversial because of its environmental message.  The movie is reasonably accurate regarding environmental issues and I think children need exposure to this kind of information so that they have an opportunity to help save our planet.  The Lord knows we have managed to do a pretty poor job of that to this point.  However, that exposure needs to be limited to older children because this movie is not for younger children who will have problems with some of the messages in this film.<br /><br />Good Luck!</p></br><a href="../users/A96K1ZGW56S2I.html">A96K1ZGW56S2I</a><br/><p>I'm a sucker for penguins. When I saw the previews for HAPPY FEET, I knew that it would be a movie I was going to see, for better or for worse.  Despite Robin Williams' voicing several characters, I was leery at first and thought the film might just turn out to be another lame animated animal movie.  This wasn't the case.<br /><br />HAPPY FEET begins in Antarctica at the meeting of two Emperor penguins, a soul-singing baritone named Memphis (Hugh Jackman) who sounds and acts like Elvis and a sweet-voiced earth angel named Norma Jean (Nicole Kidman).  In this group of Emperor penguins, soul mates find each other through the heart songs that they sing.  Some melodies just don't sound good together.  Memphis and Norma Jean meet and have an egg.  Norma Jean leaves with the females to get food before the winter ends and Memphis stays behind keeping guard and warming the egg until it should hatch in the spring.  During the longest night of the year as the male penguins huddle together walking in a massive circle, Memphis drops his egg while walking on the outside.  He is able to rescue the egg, but the accident hurts him to his core.  During the spring thaw, the egg hatches.  It is a fine baby boy, but one who can't sing but can dance better than Fred Astaire.  Norma Jean returns and for a time things are alright.  But as their son, Mumble (Elijah Wood) grows up it is quite clear that he is different from everyone, not only can he not sing and wants to dance, but even in adulthood his body is partially covered in feathers and his eyes are brilliant blue instead of the normal black penguin eyes.  After being outcasted, Mumble sets out on an adventure of his own.  He makes some new friends, meets some fascinating creatures, and ends up discovering the mystery of the disappearing fish.<br /><br />The movie has a great vocal cast.  Hugh Jackman continues to illustrate why he will soon be the #1 actor in America--his talent seems to have no limits.  Nicole Kidman gives Norma Jean the homey sensuality that recalls the famous actress of her name sake.  Elijah Wood, no doubt using his LORD OF THE RINGS experiences, seems perfect as Mumble and Brittany Murphy surprises as Mumble's love, Gloria.  Robin Williams serves as the comic relief of the movie portraying not just one, but three different characters. Williams is gifted as a voice actor and does his job well (I just wish he would go make to making good live-action movies again).<br /><br />When I saw the original trailers for HAPPY FEET, I thought the movie was going to be about dancing penguins.  As it turns out, most of the movie is about singing penguins.  In fact, the movie is basically a modern musical; there isn't much original music but instead various popular tunes and some not-so-popular ones are used as the music that moves these flightless birds.  For most of the movie scenes move from one major song to the next one, interlaced with some dialogue and humorous visual effects.<br /><br />Speaking of visuals, the animation in the movie is amazing.  The penguins look unbelievably realistic.  They seem as real as some of the living, breathing penguins you might see in a zoo.  There are also some moments later in the movie where the animation is perfectly blended with live action footage of people.  I honestly was unable to tell for sure what was live footage and what was animated.<br /><br />Though the movie relies upon some formulaic devices and storylines, HAPPY FEET isn't a typical animated feature.  The major message of the movie has to do with living a life of difference and integrity.  There are parts of the film that can be viewed as being a religion satire, a political commentary, or perhaps a little of both.  The film doesn't take sides with either a conservative or liberal point of view and the religious element serves more as prodding not to abandon belief, but to not disengage one's intellect in worship.<br /><br />HAPPY FEET doesn't gloss over the dangers that are apparent in life.  There are a group of birds who attempt to rip Mumble apart when he is still a child.  There are other seals that attempt to eat the penguins as well as a couple of orcas who almost succeed in devouring Mumble and one of his friends while they are on their quest.  In this sense, HAPPY FEET more resembles a classical fairy tale of folk story in that it doesn't gloss over the dangers that naturally happen in living life.<br /><br />HAPPY FEET is one of the two best animated movies of 2006.  It's a very different movie than the other best animated film of 2006 (CARS).  However, it does what it does extremely well.  Besides, it's got a bunch of singing and dancing penguins.  They're just so darn cute, it's hard to resist.</p></br><a href="../users/A1435P5AMCPB3X.html">A1435P5AMCPB3X</a><br/><p>This is a story about a penguin who doesn't fit in.  Amongst a family of singers, he has no voice.  However, his energy get's transferred elsewhere, and he can dance.  This movie features a great cast of voices such as robin williams, elihja woods, nichole kidmann,and britney murphy, but that just can't get you through some of the droneing that this movie seems to have in it.  It feels a lot like March of The Penguins at the beginning, but animated. But when they start to sing, it really gets boring after a bit, and makes the plot thin.  The ultimate thing is the spoiler of the political undertone.  It's not just a fun kid's movie, it is one that tries to make a big statement about humans changing the envioroment, a good message, but it's just sort of forced in here.  Overall a decent film to see once, borrow it if you must, so someone else who may have bought this can claim they got their money's worth.</p></br><a href="../users/ABFOAYZA2UHD3.html">ABFOAYZA2UHD3</a><br/><p>some 15 minutes before the end of the movie, i sent a message to my ex bf (who got the film for my son) a text msg saying "happy feet sux".<br /><br />he was supprised, and replied with "but it gor the oscar!"<br /><br />this is for the overall impression:<br /><br />going to the details, i agree with both spotlight reviews - apart from the amazing animation (in detail and mechanics of movement of both the animals and humans) this film is burdened with problems - from direction (pace), message, character development (even some of the main characters were pretty indistinguishable from one another), to the question of the main message of the movie (what sort of ending is that and what does it mean?!) and overall "heavy feeling" this film leaves you with.<br /><br />my son likes it cuz there is a lot of dancing (he dances to it) and some adventurous and funny scenes (he laughs a lot to it), so i guess i will keep it.<br /><br />nonetheless, compared to the cars and some other films, this is a sadly messed up piece of fine animation.</p></br><a href="../users/A1LBAC84TLIGAX.html">A1LBAC84TLIGAX</a><br/><p>Within the first few minutes of watching Happy Feet I was screaming it was so bad . This movie features the worst music ever, known as R&B. I wanted to go and impale myself on the nearest sharp object throughout the entire movie. The movie doesn't do anything to revitalize the movie industry, it's just another crappy animated movie like Chicken Little and Meet the Robinsons. No part of this movie was enjoyable and it felt like I was being mind-raped in my music and movie tastes section.Well,I didn't kill myself from the agony of this movie, but I better not go near any penguins because I now have the urge to beat the living crap out of a penguin for every bad penguin movie I see.</p></br><a href="../users/A2T7TZBOTP68C7.html">A2T7TZBOTP68C7</a><br/><p>We all complain when a movie is formulaic and takes no risks, such as Shark Tale.  So when a movie like Happy Feet comes along, we must award props for originality and newness.<br /><br />Happy Feet is the story of Mumble (Elijah Wood) who loves to tap dance.  He does not have the innate ability of his brother penguins, who use a heartsong to attract a mate.  Ostracized except for his friend Gloria (Brittany Murphy), he strays and becomes lost in a foreign penguin colony.  These penguins love to dance and he becomes the leader of five spunky Chicano penguins (Ramon voiced by Robin Williams, who also voices the Macaroni penguin).  His return to his home colony is less than triumphant, and he leaves again for good, on a quest to find out the source of the missing fish.<br /><br />The music soundtrack is delightful.  I love Nicole Kidman as Mumble's mother, Norma Jean.  She is a sexy singer.  The way she meets her husband Memphis (Hugh Jackman), is true love.<br /><br />Now we come to the environmental message.  It is all true that fish stocks are severely depleted and that the ocean environment is suffering.  The controversy is, does such a strong message belong in a children's movie?  That is up to the viewer to decide, but for me, it was a little heavy after all the precious, cuddly gray baby Emperor penguins and lighthearted music.  The way Mumble goes out on his quest is ultra-serious.  His eyes at one point look just like Frodo on his journey to get The Ring of Sauron.<br /><br />The movie even takes digs at religion, which is not cool.  So children will love this movie, but their parents may be disturbed by the underlying social-political messages.</p></br><a href="../users/A3FVAWZNKW9GX.html">A3FVAWZNKW9GX</a><br/><p>"Happy Feet" is fun, somewhere between Bambi for penguins and, as many have said, a musical version of "March of the Penguins" with a social message.<br /><br />What it is not is lasting. The best animated movies, like "Aladdin" (also starring Robin Williams), "Beauty and the Beast," "Snow White," and the aforementioned "Bambi," have more going on than shtick. "Happy Feet" relies too much on shtick. This makes it entertaining the first time through, and probably not the second.<br /><br />The animation is often much better than "Shrek" and "Monsters, Inc." The wry humor is as good as, or better than, the best of the Veggie Tales shorts (way better than "Jonah: The Veggie tales Movie"). The music will make an interesting soundtrack.<br /><br />What's the shtick? A dancing penguin. Great premise, but the animation's timing is weak. The sound of the tapping does not equal what is on screen. The dance routine becomes exactly that, routine. We see it once, twice, three times. The fifteenth time, I was bored with it.<br /><br />The food chain is explained well, as is the competition for food. Penguins, birds, humans, all eat fish. Some birds also eat penguins. When humans eat more fish, birds eat more penguins, and the penguin population naturally declines.<br /><br />When the penguins suffer, they look for solutions. Some ideas are silly, and blame the conservative side of penguins -- very 1950s-style Soviet communism (with a dose of Native American animism and a weaker dose of 1890s Christian revivalism). Others are survivalist, requiring endurance of characters. Mumbles becomes an unwilling solution finder. He is not looking at the big picture, he presses naively through hardship to ask simply if the humans (he thinks they are aliens) can help.<br /><br />Survival of the fittest is clear here. The struggle, the ingenuity and resourcefulness of survival is played well.<br /><br />The music, especially the introductory songs, are great fun. It will appeal mostly to fans of late 1970s and 1980s music. Its brilliance is in the mixing of songs so well that a first time listening might not realizing it is a medley.<br /><br />Williams is better than he has been recently, especially with his Barry White styled guru penguin, Lovelace.<br /><br />Characters are not always well-explained. They come and go, occasionally for no reason. This could be bad writing or editing, but, either way, left me confused.<br /><br />"Happy Feet" could be considered a movie in which the main character tries to find himself. Or, if the audience wants to think more heavily than intended, Mumbles the dancing penguin is Martin Luther, an artist, an unwilling revolutionary, or a gay activist. It flirts with all of this, but never enough to dominate the message.<br /><br />I saw it once, had fun, should have waited for the DVD. Should you see it? Sure. You too will tap your feet, laugh a little, but it is no great animated movie.<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com</p></br><a href="../users/AK7D1BHZOSOL1.html">AK7D1BHZOSOL1</a><br/><p>A fun little movie that decisively proves what I have been saying for years.

This isn't unusual in their community; the penguins spend much of their childhood going to school to learn how to sing for this is the way they attract a mate. Memphis and Norma Jean's egg is held by Dad during the winter, as Mom and the other females trek to the water, to feed and bring back food for their husbands and newborns. Memphis is a little upset when his egg doesn't hatch at the same time, but Mumble soon breaks through the shell. It quickly becomes apparent Mumble is no ordinary emperor penguin; his voice can cause glass to break, but he can dance. As Mumble grows older, he earns the nickname Happy Feet (Eiljah Wood) and becomes attracted to another penguin named Gloria (Brittany Murphy). But Mumble's dancing is unusual and scares the elders (led by Hugo Weaving) and his dancing is blamed for the lack of fish. Happy Feet decides he will venture forth and find the real cause of the lack of fish, as he learns of `Aliens', from Lovelace (Robin Williams), a leader of a different breed of penguins. Soon, he discovers an abandoned outpost built by humans.<br /><br />"Happy Feet", directed by George Miller ("Mad Max", "Babe") is a surprisingly enjoyable film.<br /><br />The animation is simply stunning. Every penguin is different and appears lifelike and real. As Mumble grows older, he is the one penguin in his group who still appears young, as though his adolescence is taking longer than normal. His feathers gradually recede throughout, giving him the appearance of growing, when all of his friends have already matured. This is yet another way he stands out and is made to feel different from the rest.<br /><br />There is a lot of music in "Happy Feet" and the animators have done a great job of making the penguins appear to be actually singing. Their tongues move in their open beaks and their movements appear both penguin-like and evocative of the words they are singing. The marriage of music and animation is very effective and brought to mind "Moulin Rouge"; "Feet" uses the same sort of popular songs in an unexpected context to tell parts of the story. Memphis (Jackman), has a bit of an Elvis persona, and sings songs in that same manner. Norma Jean (Kidman) is more the chanteuse, singing 70s rock ballads to attract her mate. Gloria (Murphy) is a modern girl, in more the Pink/ Cristina Aguilera mode and sings more modern songs. As each character begins singing, the rest of the penguins around them are so overcome by the melody, they join in creating a defacto chorus, singing along, mimicking the moves, etc.<br /><br />There are a couple of really nice sequences throughout "Happy Feet". At one point, Mumble and his friends are dancing and singing and then start swimming and the sequence evolves into a choreographed Busby Berkley/ Esther Williams-esque homage, everyone begins to swim in synchronized movements, swirling in circles around other swimmers. All of this is fun to watch and the animation is simply stunning and very fluid, reminiscent of the live action footage in "March of the Penguins".<br /><br />Later, Mumble and some of his friends, the different breed of penguins with Spanish accents, are swimming through the water, trying to evade a giant leopard seal. Again, great animation because it is so fluid and believable as they dart in and under stone arches, past underwater rock formations, and through tunnels.<br /><br />It is also fun to watch Mumble dance. He lets the rhythm take over and his feet begin tapping and doing a soft shoe. Famed dancer Savion Glover actually did the dancing for Mumble and his signature style is very recognizable, lots of tapping and sliding feet back and forth. They filmed Glover actually dancing, using Motion Capture technology. When they animated Mumble, Glover's feet and movements were copied and computers were used to animate the penguin's dance steps. It is a little more complicated than that, but you get the idea.<br /><br />The voice characterizations are good, but not great. Jackman seems to have the most fun with his character, giving him a discernible feel and accent. Kidman is also good and she imbues Norma Jean with a wispy, `bombshell' like voice. Eiljah Wood is less successful as Mumble and Brittany Murphy's Gloria could have been done by any other young female actress. Her voice is very recognizable, but she does little to make the character unique.<br /><br />Robin Williams provides three voices. The first is Lovelace, the leader of the smaller breed of penguins. Slightly overweight and full of bombast, he knows his place in the world and wants to keep his kingdom intact. But he is most successful with Ramon, the leader of the five penguins who tag along with Happy Feet during his journey. Using a Spanish accent, the character is funny and provides some comic relief along the way. A third voice only makes a brief appearance.<br /><br />"Happy Feet" attempts to make a statement about the effects of the environment on these animals; the lack of fish for the penguins is causing problems and the elders naturally suspect the unusual new moves Happy Feet is making. But Happy Feet learns of strange beings, "aliens", from Lovelace and suspects they may be the cause. Shunned by his community, he sets out on a quest. Without revealing too much, examples of human influences on the penguins are shown, but the course of Happy Feet's journey is strange. He has some interactions with humans, but the end result is not convincing. All of a sudden, the mere presence of the penguin leads many humans to make sweeping, world wide environmental changes.<br /><br />In the last act, when Happy Feet comes into contact with humans, we actually see some of these people. I can't figure out if director Miller used just live action footage or if he filmed real actors and then treated it in some way. The humans appear realistic, but slightly soft, almost ghost like. It is an interesting look. But at the same time, the introduction of such realistic human elements makes "Happy Feet" resemble one of those live action Disney nature films made in the 60s and 70s, where a human scientist makes a brief appearance watching the lion cubs on the veldt.<br /><br />"Happy Feet" is an enjoyable, fun film for the whole family. Not a classic, but worth watching.</p></br><a href="../users/AKT8TGIT6VVZ5.html">AKT8TGIT6VVZ5</a><br/><p>Without question, the current success enjoyed by "Happy Feet" owes much to the great French documentary "March Of The Penguins", though I strongly suspect that this fine animated film was well in the works prior to news of the documentary film's release. Australian film director George Miller, best known for his "Mad Max" films and "Babe", has created a delightful, charming film about what it means to be different - and celebrating that difference - featuring some of the best animation I have seen lately not done by Pixar Studios. And I might add too that Miller has done a decent job in choosing pop songs for the film's music, sung well by the likes of Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman and Brittany Murphy (Without a doubt, Miller is paying homage to fellow Australian Baz Luhrman's "Moulin Rouge", and nearly suceeds in pulling off his own musical highwire act in this film.). Elijah Wood's loveable young Emperor Penguin, Mumbles, nearly steals every scene he is in, except when he interacts with Jackass Penguins Ramon and Lovelace (Both voiced to dazzling hilarious effect by Robin Williams.). I say "Bah Humbug" to those who've dislked this charming little animated film; it's dual uplifting messages of celebrating those who are different from the rest of the pack and helping to preserve Antarctica from overfishing are those which are not only timely, but more importantly, worthy of attention to entire families. Moreover, the "adult" pop songs are used to such great comedic effect, that only those familiar with Prince's music, for example, might find their usage in this film a bit too risque for the entire family to enjoy. Truly, without question, "Happy Feet" deserves all the honors it has earned so far, and definitely ranks among my best films of 2006.</p></br><a href="../users/A2R4XG0L7Z01V8.html">A2R4XG0L7Z01V8</a><br/><p>... But most likely in boredom, unless you're really young. If you're older, skip this and watch March Of The Penguins instead. This is pretty much a happier version.<br /><br />As I quite often mention in reviews of animations, these days it's more spot the famous voice, than actually paying that much attention to the film. Here, we have Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, a poor effort by Robin Williams, and Brittany Murphy. But in this, it's also a case of spot the song used. Yes, there are some full songs used, but there's also a couple where just a line or two is used. How many did you spot? I managed to spot all of these:<br /><br />Somebody To Love (bad vocal from Brittany)<br />My Way<br />Kiss (Nicole Kidman doing her Marilyn Monroe impersonation)<br />Boogie Wonderland<br />I Only Have Eyes For You<br />Unchained Melody<br />Hello<br />Let's Talk About Sex<br />Heartbreak Hotel (when's Hugh Jackman releasing an album?)<br />Chantilly Lace<br />I'll Make Love To You<br />Shake Your Bon-Bon<br />If You Leave Me Now<br />Baby Got Back<br />Leader Of The Pack<br /><br />Quite a handful yes?<br /><br />The also problem I have is that many animations these days, with talking animals, are all "animals vs humans", which is getting a little bit tired. But at least there's no drug references in this, like some older Disney movies. It's also too long for a kids film, and I was getting antsy watching it, so I guess any kid will be totally bored and annoying their parents by some point.<br /><br />The film also throws across a very strong political message, about global warming, humans wrecking the environment and animals suffering. Is that really what you want in a kids movie? I know very old Disney shorts were very pro-war but in this day and age, it's not really appropriate. I recently bought the two Ice Age movies, I wonder what message I'm going to get that I'm old enough to understand.<br /><br />It may be a cute movie, but if you've already seen March Of The Penguins, you will notice a few similarities. And the whole scene where the penguin is being batted about by a whale's tail - hello, if that was real, the penguin would have all its bones broken, and would be dead. It's a whale's TAIL. Ouch!<br /><br />I was expecting this to be a nice happy Easter movie, as it was released in time for it, but was disappointed once again, by an animation film. When are they going to release all their fancy motion capture and CGI aren't going to save a movie?</p></br><a href="../users/A1K31NF81TS0CO.html">A1K31NF81TS0CO</a><br/><p>Awesome show!  Love it!

Remember this because despite the cute, cuddly face of a baby penguin you might be looking at in the film's poster or DVD jacket, the film itself looks odd at times, like the adventures of the little pig in the strange town. I'm not saying that "Happy Feet" (or the sequel of "Babe") is bad. I'm just saying that you might not find what you think you will find in "Happy Feet."<br /><br />The film starts like a musical parody of "March of the Penguin," a recent hit documentary about the life of Emperor Penguins. Lots of penguins are singing, and among them you meet a male penguin `Memphis' (read Elvis) and Norma Jean (read Marilyn). They fell for each other and ... well, you know the rest of the story. Baby boy penguin Mumble is born, who is a terrible singer, but a fantastic dancer with `happy feet.' Ironically his enormous talent is not wanted in the colony he belongs to.<br /><br />The first part looks like a strange mixture of musical version of nature programs and "Planet of the Apes." Ruling elders does not like Mumble and his dancing, which they consider a threat to their colony. His mother is more understanding than his father who looks worried, or worse, embarrassed at his son's behaviors.<br /><br />The visuals are always impressive, and the songs are provided liberally (including the cover version of Prince, Frank Sinatra, the Beatles, etc) and the chase scenes are thrilling, maybe too thrilling for some kids.<br /><br />I said you know the rest of the story before. Actually, you don't. Typical story of `finding my own place' with a love interest and comic relief turns into something different in the second half, which is more ambitious than the entire story of "Finding Nemo" and more serious and even weird than you expect from any animated films produced in Hollywood. All I can say is that it includes certain messages about the Earth, or in a nutshell, Mumble's "Happy Feet" saves the world.<br /><br />The voice cast is great, including Elijah Wood as Mumble, Brittany Murphy, Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman, Hugo Weaving, Elizabeth Daily, Magda Szubanski, Miriam Margolyes and Robin Williams. It is, however, a bit strange to see and hear a penguin with Elijah Wood's eyes speaking in Elijah Wood's voice. Seeing penguins with voices of Nicole Kidman or Brittany Murphy shaking and wiggling their body is not surely what many of us would expect from the title "Happy Feet." It is also reported that Tony winner Savion Glover is hired to shoot the tap dance scenes of the penguin with motion capture device on his body. All you see is, however, animated penguins, of which superhuman dancing ability is, after all, computer graphics, not the real human.<br /><br />"Happy Feet" is really a mixed bag. Those who love the comedies of scene stealing (or annoying, if you like) double roles by Robin Williams would find the film's second part very bizarre. Some would find the images of penguins and other creature a bit too realistic, even grotesque. Like he did in the second "Babe" George Miller finds originality in the places where few other directors would explore, but I am not perfectly certain that disco music/dancing and environmental messages are the right place. "Happy Feet" is fun, to be sure, but sorry, to me the best animated film on penguins is still "Madagascar" and its penguin gang.</p></br><a href="../users/A2EDZH51XHFA9B.html">A2EDZH51XHFA9B</a><br/><p>Happy Feet (George Miller, 2006)<br /><br />George Miller gave us Mad Max. Then he grew up and turned his talent to serious filmmaking, and he gave us Lorenzo's Oil. You'd not be stretching much by tagging either with the word "classic." Then he disappeared for a while. He resurfaced and wrote two of the best kids' films of the past decade in Babe and its sequel, Pig in the City. Then, once again, he disappeared from sight. Is it wrong to have assumed, given George Miller's track record, that he would once again emerge with something sterling?<br /><br />Instead, we got Happy Feet, a confused mess of a movie that joins the junk heap of worthless 2006 kids' movies, the largest pile of them in recent memory. Even Pixar couldn't come up with something that rose above mediocre in 2006. George Miller should have been a savior. Instead, we got Happy Feet.<br /><br />For its first fifteen minutes, this movie wants to be a subject-less musical with well-rendered, but age-inappropriate and badly-covered, pop tunes. This is not necessarily a horrible thing; any parent who spends an hour listening to Satan's mouthpiece on Earth, Radio Disney, will be greatly surprised at the number of songs s/he recognizes (and despairs at how awfully they've been rendered by the current generation of child TV stars). I was prepared for bad child-star renderings of previously popular songs. As a result, the first fifteen minutes of the movie were its most enjoyable. Had it stayed on that track, it would have worked.<br /><br />Then, however, it became a coming-of-age tale with assorted bad musical numbers. Mumble (Elijah Wood) is a penguin who can't sing. (Whether any of the others can is open to debate, but you have to accept it for the premise. Note that, ironically, the only professional singer in the cast who plays an Emperor penguin plays Mumble as a baby.) He expresses his musical gift in another way-- he can dance. Noah (Hugo Weaving), the tribe elder, is convinced that Mumble, being different, is evil, and should be cast out of the tribe. But he doesn't need to be cast out; the other penguins do a fine job of marginalizing him. (Don't worry, this is the subtle message in the movie.) Mumble wanders off on his own and finds another tribe of penguins. Ramon, his first contact with the tribe, and Lovelace, their spiritual leader, are both voiced by Robin Williams. (That nothing has yet been said about Robin Williams' awful hispanic accent and the stereotyping of the "lazy Mexican" in this penguin tribe is somewhat confounding.) After some clashes with Noah and the setup of a love-story subplot with Mumble's childhood friend Gloria (Brittany Murphy), we get into the third direction this movie wants to pull us, which anyone who's seen any kids' movie since FernGully should be all too familiar with: the idea that every time a human being sets foot outside his environmentally-destructive door, he will cause further irreparable harm to the environment, leading to the imminent destruction of the entire planet unless we DO SOMETHING RIGHT NOW.<br /><br />Frankly, it's not just getting old, it was already old when FernGully came out. Worse, it's the most obvious, braindead form of inculcation possible, and we allow our children to wallow in it without us ever questioning it. It's gotten to the point where "oh, boy, another kids' movie!" equates with "oh, boy, another vicious attack on humanity's inability to live in harmony with the environment!" It's pathetic and disgusting. Even if Happy Feet had been an otherwise brilliant movie, the braindead pandering in the final third of its length would have knocked a couple of stars off its rating. But it's not an otherwise brilliant movie. It's a confused, needlessly complex mess that could have been a pretty decent-- at best-- musical. Instead, it's one of the worst films I have personally experienced in 2006, and I attribute this only to the fact that I was successfully able to avoid seeing both Madea's Family Reunion and the Larry the Cable Guy movie. *</p></br><a href="../users/A2C5VLIJMDPWHI.html">A2C5VLIJMDPWHI</a><br/><p>I am SO glad that I managed to negotiate with my nephews on seeing this movie instead of the Santa Clause flick.  From the preview alone, I wanted to see the Grandmaster Flash rendition of the song, done by a penguin.  The voice alone was adorable.  I just wanted to hang out with my nephews, tried to find a movie we could all get into, and was caught offguard at how interested I became in the plot of this one.<br /><br />Overview: The main character is a penguin who has been ostracized from his peers and family because he cannot sing, like all other penguins (apparently) always have been able to.  But, he can juke with the best of them.  Unfortunately, his peers are not entertained by his gift and abandon him repeatedly.  He finds comfort by branching off on his own and finding other penguins who appreciate his unique style.  On his journey to find companionship, he meets another penguin and some other birds who have seen "aliens" from other places.  Now, when the "aliens" are introduced, this is when the grown-ups will start really paying attention.  The "aliens" leave litter behind that is affecting the health of the penguins, take massive amounts of food from the water and leave the penguins starving, capture birds to put in aquariums, and/or attach mechanical devices to their bodies for research.  Sound familiar?  It should.  Being a vegetarian who despises anything that emprisons living beings and completely annoyed by people who litter, I wanted to dance my happy feet for this movie having such great principles.  But I managed to remain seated and bounce around in my seat during all the incredibly adorable pop/hip-hop/R&B routines.  Eventually, the main penguin goes off on a search to find food for his family, finds out more information on the "aliens" and the "aliens" find out that penguins are living on this land.<br /><br />I won't tell the end, but I was very pleased with the outcome.  It wasn't so much about the principles mentioned above (litter and lack of food for an animal's natural habitat), but also because the elders of this penguin are so against change.  They are annoyed that the main penguin cannot sing like the rest and that he seems so unapologetic about it, and instead wants to show off his ability to (tap)dance.  Besides them not appreciating his gift, they try to make everyone else abandon him too, which is so relatable to anyone who has experienced differences, be it race, religion, education, politics, physical appearance, etc.  I liked the message it sent to kids.  Try to look at differences in your peers as a learning experience instead of a threat, because the peer who is different may be the one who can help you in ways you can't imagine.<br /><br />P.S.  The animation in this movie was great. I jumped when the sharks and seals came, and I wanted to reach out and hug the main penguin. He just looked so soft and pretty.  What a great movie!  I think I liked it more than my nephews, regardless of those two tap dancing past the nachos and popcorn all the way to the exit doors.</p></br><a href="../users/A39W3263A9HCMN.html">A39W3263A9HCMN</a><br/><p>I saw this movie yesterday.

I was sorely disappointed. The movie did wildlife a huge disservice by casting leopard seals and killer whales as little more than evil predators. Neither species is evil. Both do what they have evolved to do. Lending some moral superiority to penguins which eat fish (and hence is a predator), while not extending the same respect to seals and whales is wrong-headed at best. It confused my nephew and caused him to want to kill whales and seals. All in all, a huge waste of time. Plus the mexican slurs provided by Robin Williams should have been removed, very insensitive. Plus, I must add it also supports the sterotype of the traditional dad as little more than a close-minded fool. Avoid this like the plague. Oh, not enough music for me. Very sad!!!</p></br><a href="../users/A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ.html">A3QJU4FEN8PQSZ</a><br/><p>A shrill, sometimes dark, traumatizing leftist screed involving nasty religious penguins, good nonreligious younger hip-hop penguins singing about nappy hair, penguins with harems, penguins singing about wanting each others' bodies, overfishing, dementia ... this movie is not for kids. The style is semi-realistic, i.e. not very cartoonish, which was strange. You've probably seen the plot summarized already. This is not a good movie night for the whole family.</p></br><a href="../users/A3I49HL6XR62DI.html">A3I49HL6XR62DI</a><br/><p>This animated feature is very unusual. Directed by the great Australian film maker George Miller (Mad Max, Road Warrior), it is thoughtful, endearing, funny and, at times, surprisingly dark. It's an all-singing, all-dancing version of March of the Penguins with adorable vocalizations by Elijah Wood (Mumble), Robin Williams (Ramon and Lovelace), Britney Murphey (Gloria), Hugh Jackman (Memphis) and Nicole Kidman (Norma Jean, Mumble's mom). You have to see it to believe it and you will either love it or you won't get it. I loved it. Caution: the killer whales and the elephant seals (with Aussie accents) are very realistic and pretty scary. The leopard seal is absolutely terrifying. Parents should exercise caution with very small children. But Mumble is the cutest and older kids will love his incredible journey as he teaches the worlds of nature and man to co-exist. Highly recommended.</p></br><a href="../users/A1I7QGUDP043DG.html">A1I7QGUDP043DG</a><br/><p>I loved the diversity in music in this film! There was a great mix that went well with the story, making it enjoyable for adults as well as children. There are some PG-13 moments with very slight hints to 'reproduction', so parents will want to view it first and determine if it's age appropriate for their youngster. The story is a wonderful tale about a penguin that doesn't have a song in his voice because it's in his feet. If he can't find his own heart-song, how will he ever find a mate? The movie touches on environmental themes, references to being different and finding your own unique qualities, as well as introductions to other cultures. The music plays a key role and is very well woven into the screenplay. Overall, I thought it was very enjoyable and none of the issues the story was trying to highlight were 'preachy'. I'll watch it again and again.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author</p></br><a href="../users/A18G7GG53G2X8A.html">A18G7GG53G2X8A</a><br/><p>I went into "Happy Feet" feeling a bit jaded from the slew of animated films released in 2006 (those of you who read my review for "Flushed Away" will know exactly what I'm talking about). I kept thinking: will another one be too much for me to handle? Thank goodness the answer was no; for the most part, "Happy Feet" is a well-paced, clever film that's delightfully energetic, playfully humorous, and deceptively informative. Above all, it's thoroughly entertaining, containing many scenes that would rival some of today's best musical plays (if it weren't for the fact that penguins can't actually sing or dance). I enjoyed the characters. I enjoyed the music. I enjoyed the choreography. I enjoyed the photography, despite the landscapes being completely computer generated.<br /><br />Most of all, I enjoyed the fact that, for a family film, the story was original. Let me explain: the ideas that were presented have been used in more serious, less family-oriented films. "Happy Feet" is formulaic as a Self Discovery movie. It tells the story of an emperor penguin named Mumble (eventually voiced by Elijah Wood) living in Antarctica. He lacks the ability to sing in a world where finding one's heart song is vital for achieving true love. His only form of expression is dance; his feet tap away at lightening speed, and he practically floats across the ice. Unfortunately, none of the other penguins can appreciate or even understand this ability, and he's immediately labeled as an unworthy misfit.<br /><br />The story is also formulaic as a Hero's Journey fable. The fact that the colony's fish supply is dwindling is hinted at early on. The cause for such depletion is also hinted at; at one point, a ravenous bird (Anthony LaPaglia) tells Mumble that aliens abducted him. The creatures were big and fat, with eyes positioned on the front of the head and with odd appendages protruding from their bodies. And much to everyone's dismay, they're also smarter. They poked, prodded, and manhandled the bird, and they attached a small orange cylinder to his ankle before releasing him. Such descriptions stay with Mumble, and they come in handy when the fish supply is virtually gone; because he suspects that these aliens are responsible, he decides to find them and ask for a stop to their destructive behavior. What he has yet to understand is how far he'll have to go and how dangerous a journey it will be.<br /><br />Thus far, the plot is fairly straightforward and seemingly perfect for families. However, the film doesn't adhere to the conventional child-friendly storytelling methods; not only does it have a non-traditional happy ending, it also has an underlying seriousness that isn't as obvious in other such films. For one thing, the penguin's group dynamic suggests religious satire; Mumble and his parents are part of a very large gathering, one that's lead by group of elders. Everyday, they preach to the penguins the importance of praying to a god, which we already know is nothing more than the Aurora Borealis. What's worse, they see Mumble as a deviant whose dancing angers the penguin god. If he wishes to remain among his kind, he must give his feet a rest and learn how to sing.<br /><br />The satire goes further. Mumble's father--the Elvis-sounding Memphis (Hugh Jackman)--has trouble accepting his son's inability to sing, convinced that he "turned out wrong" because his egg was accidentally dropped. Even though he loves his son, he believes that, for the good of the colony, Mumble needs to shape up. "Don't ask me to change," he says, "because I can't." His mother--the Marilyn Monroe-sounding Norma Jean (Nicole Kidman)--is much more understanding; even though her son can't sing, she sees that he isn't any less of a penguin. Even Gloria (Brittany Murphy)--the would-be love interest--is eventually willing to look past Mumble's shortcomings. But as he will come to learn, the support of two penguins isn't enough for him to be accepted by the entire colony.<br /><br />The satire goes further still. After being chased by a hungry seal, Mumble finds a new colony of penguins, ones of a different and shorter species. He first meets a small gang of thrill seekers led by Ramon (Robin Williams), a character so full of stereotypical Latin machismo that he practically steals the film. He introduces Mumble to Lovelace (also voiced by Williams), the religious leader of the group whose voice is a cross between a Barry White impression and a televangelist. He claims to have the answer to everything, and a dedicated following shows that many believe this to be true. All he asks for is a pebble as a form of payment. He's first seen standing on a gigantic pile of pebbles, haughtily preaching to those who seek answers. But from our point of view, something is not right; around Lovelace's neck is a "talisman," which in reality is nothing more than the plastic six-pack rings used to hold soda cans. Such an idea is understandably disturbing, and it gets worse when he's later seen choking. But it's also effective, especially as the film draws to a close.<br /><br />Mumble and his new friends begin the journey to find the "aliens," which leads to a pretty interesting turn of events. Let's just say that Mumble finds them, and he sees that their world is defined by putting other species in confined spaces (ones that ineffectively recreate the areas they came from). His experience paves the way for an ending I didn't particularly care for. I found that bothersome; this would have been a perfect film had it not been for the ending, which is far too contrived to suit such an original story. Nonetheless, I have to give "Happy Feet" all five stars. I was amazed at its willingness to be different and I absolutely loved the satirical undertones.</p></br><a href="../users/AZCDCO6KK2T81.html">AZCDCO6KK2T81</a><br/><p>IN SHORT:<br /><br />The animation is truly groundbreaking, the voices are perfectly cast, the soundtrack is a delightful, and although the direction is a bit lost in the pacing department, it is competent.  I thoroughly enjoyed this simplistic story about acceptance, respect, and standing up for one's self.  I am not overly concerned with some of the political, environmental and religious overtones that some have made a big deal over here.  The larger storyline and themes that I already mentioned are honest and straight-forward enough; I just don't see all the so-called "evil propaganda" imbedded in the story about abandoning faith, hating seals, and to stop all fishing.  I think that is just reading too much into things and I don't see any of these as the essential messages of the film. I really can't understand why anyone would fault a family movie that promotes being a bit more environmentally aware and to be more accepting of those that are different.  Sit back and relax and just enjoy the film!  It is an exceptional one.<br /><br />IN LONG (and I hope worth your reading):<br /><br />I always try to avoid confrontation on political, environmental, and religious viewpoints as they tend to be very personal.  We often respond with a knee-jerk reaction to every criticism in these areas because they are so personal and, thus, produce a less than positive outcome by the end (if there ever is one) on any one topic in these arenas.  We rarely "win" anyone to "our side" and often alienate the very individuals we set out to win to our side (whatever "our side" may be).  It is within these very corridors of hate, suspicion, and intolerant extremism that some reviewers here are walking as apparent in not only their reviews, but also in their vicious comments to all that question their specific view of things.  I kind of enjoy the irony that that is one of the very themes within this film and endlessly argued about here.<br /><br />It matters little whether I agree or disagree with others here on the so-called "hidden agenda" or not-so-subtle themes presented in the film.  I always try to have a dignified discussion whenever I can, but this whole online thing seems to allow many to behave like the schoolyard bully we remember from our youth.  They seem to think that it's okay to be ruthless online as they can hide in the safety of cyberspace.  Many of these reviews and discussions, on both sides of the issues, have gotten way out of line and personal and they didn't need to be.<br /><br />I for one found this to be a simple movie and PG or not, it is designed for kids.  There aren't too many adults who would venture out to this without their kids to see it and simply because a film is rated PG does not mean it isn't intended mostly for kids.  I'm not sure where some here got the notion that PG is adults ONLY as I've seen debated here.  PG is simply Parental Guidance is SUGGESTED and usually followed with reasons why.  That's it.  Even some PG-13 films are designed for the whole family although one has to be careful with those films.  In any event,  the themes in "Happy Feet" are simple enough without diving headlong into an endless debate on the film's intentions and rating.  My children, 10 and 14, didn't leave the theatre thinking "Oh my gosh, Dad, they were condemning our faith" or "seals are terrible creatures picking on cute funny penguins" and nor did they respond with "now let's stop all that fishing, Dad.  It's evil" or "Let's dethrone the Pope."  Even if the intentions of the film makers where such, then they failed miserably as I haven't met anyone, child or adult, who has read so much into a simple animated film as those here.  I personally think that is a bit hypersensitive, but like I said earlier, we all can be on issues related to politics, faith, and the environment.<br /><br />Please keep in mind that I'm denying that certain themes aren't prevelent in the film; I simply think that they are good ones for the most part, and for the perhaps negative ones, I'm just not that sensitive to be upset about.  I'm confident many will think differently and label me a liberal moron (even though I'm a conservative Christian by most), and others will label me a lukewarm Christian for not being upset about the perceived anti-Catholic/Christian messages in the film.  I guess I am a moderate or I just don't get all hyped up over a kids movie that has, what I personally believe to be, predominantly good messages in it.<br /><br />For the record, yes, I saw the themes in the film about abusing nature and overfishing.  I think one is hard-pressed to not noticed what we've done to our environment.  I do find it sad that some here hoot and holler "where's the evidence?" and equally complaining about such a message in a kids' film.  The fact that we can literally count the number of blue whales left should be an indication of how far we've gone.  The fact that those on the space shuttle can literally notice the level of deforestation from one flight to another should be another indicator of our abuse of nature.  I offer these off-handed pieces of evidence with the full knowledge that those who think differently will quickly dismiss them or insist on more facts and stats until it weighs a ton above their heads which appear to be buried in the sand.  In any event, I don't see what all the fuss is over a kid's film containing some messages about caring for the planet better than their adult counterparts do or did.<br /><br />Yes, again, I noticed the theme of questioning what we may have always believed and I truly understand how this theme could unsettle some; however, I also saw, to greater extent, accepting those who are different and can not or will not conform to society's norms (whatever they may be).  I really don't see this as condeming Catholics or Christians as some here have been screaming.  Someone once told me that with doubt comes faith.  We shouldn't blindly accept anything, but rather discover what is truth to us individually.  Afterall, isn't faith believing in things not seen but hoped for?  That is going to be different things to different people.  I have never been concerned about our children questioning our faith, and, in fact, I encourage it.  I don't want my faith to be theirs simply on my say so.  Faith is such a personal thing and forcing something on someone never really resolves much and breeds contempt in the end anyhow.<br /><br />In that vein I also noted the theme in the film of ignorance in attempting to destroy whatever is different from what we normally accept and, sadly, I've seen that in the reviews and comments on this film.  Why must we always demonize the individual who thinks differently?  How ironic that that is exactly the focus of this film.</p></br><a href="../users/A2582KMXLK2P06.html">A2582KMXLK2P06</a><br/><p>While I have to disagree with the many negative reviews this movie has received, I can't agree that the movie is a really awesome classic either.  It's somewhere betweeen "above average" and "really good".  I guess that would make it "good". lol<br /><br />Before watching Happy Feet, I knew there'd be a fair amount of musical bits with penguins singing and dancing all over the frozen landscape, but what I didn't know was that the storyline would be about penguins that HAVE to have a singing voice in order to fit in and be well-liked by the other penguins.  It's kind of pathetic to me that the penguins who couldn't sing had to be treated like yesterdays garbage by the other penguins.  Then again, it's just an animated film.  No reason to care about this *too* hard.<br /><br />Anyway, even though musical bits in movies aren't really my thing, this one at least had a solid selection of tunes to elevate my interest.  Mostly older songs were included, such as funky Stevie Wonder-like music from the 70's or Queen's "Somebody to Love".  The one penguin singing Elvis's "Heartbreak Hotel" was REALLY funny.  You will love this scene.<br /><br />They did a nice job in the beginning of the film giving the viewer a realistic idea of how penguins are born.  This was included and given a fair amount of attention, which was appreciated by me.<br /><br />Still, it was strange to me that the main character (the one penguin with the talent to tap dance) went through an extremely lengthy amount of time without the other penguins noticing that he had a real talent.  Just because he couldn't sing, he was ignored.  Then suddenly, after roughly 60% of the film went by, they began to notice his tap-dancing ability and began singing along to it and treating it like it was the most important thing in the world.  The penguins weren't made to look like intelligent creatures, that's for sure.<br /><br />The action scenes were really good.  The penguins being attacked by birds and sharks was very exciting to watch.  It was fun watching them constantly find ways to escape.<br /><br />If you have an interest in penguins and think they're adorable little birds, you will no doubt LOVE this movie.  For me, it was just a pleasant and harmless story.</p></br><a href="../users/A22TZUXUKA11SQ.html">A22TZUXUKA11SQ</a><br/><p>In the tradition of Finding Nemo, Happy Feet is the story of the kid who just isn't like the others. Mumble is the son of two emperor penguins that both have beautiful singing voices. The emperor penguin uses song to find a mate, so it's important that they learn from an early age to sing from their heart so that they can find their one true love. Unfortunately for Mumble, he can't sing. Not just can't sing well, but can't sing at all, to the point where the penguins' vocal coach--who has never turned down a case--throws up her hands in defeat when he tries. Instead, Mumble has another talent. He likes to dance. His "happy feet" make him stick out like a sore thumb and cause him to be an outcast in the penguin community. Like Mumble's father says, dancing "just ain't penguin." Happy Feet is the story of Mumble's struggle to find a way to fit in with the rest of the crowd.<br /><br />Having just watched March of the Penguins, Happy Feet was such a welcome change from the sad tale of how harsh life is for these animals. The entire time I watched MotP, I kept wondering what in the world sustains these male penguins as they stand in the freezing cold protecting these eggs. In Happy Feet, the answer is song. The male penguins huddle together for warmth, singing their heart song, and wait for their mates to return. It's romantic and endearing at the same time. I think anyone who liked March of the Penguins will enjoy Happy Feet. I would also recommend that the people who enjoy this movie see MotP.</p></br><a href="../users/A35ZK3M8L9JUPX.html">A35ZK3M8L9JUPX</a><br/><p>In the cold land of Antarctica, the Emperor Penguins each express their true love with a special heartsong of their own that expresses their very being. However, the misfit Mumble cannot sing, but instead has an extraordinary talent to tap dance with almost magical energy and expression. Nevertheless, the deeply conformist leadership of the colony fearfully blames the young penguin's unorthodox ways for the lean fishing that threatens them all. Defiant in the face of unjust rejection, Mumble and his true friends set out to find the true cause of the famine. Through the motley crew's trials and perils, Mumble learns many things about his frozen world, not the least of which being that his toe tapping talent may be what he needs to save his people. This movie is a feel-good animated movie that works on a few different levels; it will make you laugh, cry, and make you tap your toes or bounce your leg. Happy Feet makes your heart soar from start to finish. This movie is definitely worth watching with your kids.</p></br></body></html>
